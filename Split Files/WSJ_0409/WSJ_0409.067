   Two large bank holding companies said their first-quarter
results would be reduced significantly by increased
provisions for loan losses.
   The higher losses reflect continued problems in commercial
real estate, particularly in the Northeast. For PNC Financial
Corp., which increased its loan losses by between $70 million
and $80 million, the higher provisions will lower
first-quarter profit by as much as 40%. In the year-ago
period, Pittsburgh-based PNC earned $123.6 million, or $1.32
a share.

   Midlantic Corp., meanwhile, bolstered its first-quarter
loan-loss provision by an additional $110 million, all but
wiping out its estimated first-quarter earnings. In the
year-earlier first quarter, Midlantic earned $59.5 million,
or $1.53 a share. The Edison, N.J., company didn't specify
what it expects to report for the latest quarter.
   The banks' decisions to increase reserves may presage
similar moves by other lenders. In the wake of huge losses
among banks in New England, Florida and elsewhere, examiners
have said they intend to scrutinize loan portfolios more
carefully. The goal is to make sure that all non-performing
loans are properly classified.
   "The standards have been out there but just not enforced,"
said analyst Lacy Shockley of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. "Sooner or later, {examiners} will get to them, and every
one will have to go through their portfolios and apply these
tougher standards."
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, PNC shares fell $3.875 to $34. In over-the-counter
trading, Midlantic was unchanged at $14.125.
   While analysts had anticipated larger provisions at
Midlantic, the PNC moves generally weren't expected from a
bank long regarded as well managed and conservatively run.
Friday's announcement, though, suggested to some analysts
that PNC has been overly aggressive in its lending. Reacting
to that prospect, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said Friday
it had placed PNC's debt rating under review for possible
downgrade.
   "My guess is that, contrary their previous statements,
credit quality is not stable, and it continues to
deteriorate," said James M. Rosenberg, a banking analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton who first wrote in August 1988 that
the bank had credit problems. "I think the bloom has been off
the rose for two years now," he said.
   Last year, PNC characterized $386.8 million in loans as
"possible credit problems," including $166.9 million in
real-estate construction loans. In 1988, the entire category
accounted for $83.8 million in loans.
   PNC has now significantly increased its loan-loss
provisions in two consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1989, the bank holding company added $180 million
to its provisions for bad Third World debt and domestic
real-estate loans.
   The bank denies that it's ever disguised credit-quality
problems. PNC said the Office of the Comptroller of Currency,
using tougher reviewing criteria, recently examined its
Cincinnati-based Central Bancorporation unit. The result of
the review was a moderate increase in the unit's
non-performing assets.
   PNC said it took the large loan-loss provision to cover
itself in case future reviews of affiliates, including its
largest, Pittsburgh National Bank, result in similar
increases in non-performing assets.
   Meanwhile, at Midlantic, where higher provisions had been
expected, New Jersey's second-largest banking company has
been one of the state's most active construction lenders. At
the end of 1988, commercial real estate represented 30% of
Midlantic's loan portfolio, the highest of any major New
Jersey bank.
   The bank said it is preparing itself for a further decline
in the real-estate market and an increase in Midlantic's
non-performing loans. The increase in the loan-loss provision
brings the total reserve to $450 million.
   Midlantic said it expects to report for the first-quarter
non-performing loans of $630 million, and $85 million of
real-estate acquired through foreclosures.
   Reflecting the anticipated troubles, Moody's said Friday
that it had downgraded $450 million of long-term debt of
Midlantic. It cited "the ongoing process of deterioration in
the real-estate credit portion of . . . member banks' loan
portfolio."
