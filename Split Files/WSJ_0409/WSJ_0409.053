   TOKYO -- Nikko Research Center lowered by 0.1% its
estimate for Japanese gross national product growth in fiscal
1990 to 3.9%, the company announced.
   The company predicted that domestic demand will fall off
during the second half of the fiscal year, as stock market
instability and higher interest rates trim private capital
investment and housing outlays.
