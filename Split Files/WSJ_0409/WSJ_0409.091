   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. is making a
bold play for software industry leadership with its surprise
agreement to acquire Novell Inc., of Provo, Utah, for $1.5
billion in stock.
   The action solves Lotus's biggest long-term problem --
being a one-product company. Since Novell has more than half
the market for network software, the combined company is
likely to play a big technological role as other software
companies design their programs to work in the networks of
personal computers that are spreading through offices. And if
their marketing arms can sell each other's products, they
will get the attention of many customers.

   Analysts said that if the two companies successfully merge
their strengths and offset their weaknesses, they may provide
a counterweight to the industry dominance of Microsoft Inc.,
Redmond, Wash., which competes with both Lotus and Novell.
   "The merger rearranges the power structure of the software
industry," said Aaron Goldberg, a market researcher with
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. Combined, the two
companies' sales are expected to top $1.2 billion this year;
analysts expect Microsoft to have $1.1 billion in revenue in
its fiscal year ending June 30.
   Lotus agreed to acquire Novell for 41.6 million shares of
stock with a market value of about $1.5 billion. It would be
the third-biggest computer industry merger ever after
Burroughs Corp.'s merger with Sperry Corp. to form Unisys
Inc. and General Motors Corp.'s $2.5 billion acquisition of
Electronic Data Systems Inc.
   Lotus was once the industry leader because of the success
of its best-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet. But its failure to
come up with other hits has enabled Microsoft, which has come
out with a slew of popular products, to surpass it.
   Timothy McCollum, a software analyst with Dean Witter,
said, "This is a very good growth area for Lotus to get
into."
   Networking personal computers together is a booming
business because personal computers are becoming powerful
enough to do the jobs of minicomputers and even mainframes in
corporate and government offices.
   However, Mr. McCollum cautioned that merging the two
companies may prove difficult. John McCarthy, an analyst with
Forrester Research, Cambridge, Mass., predicted corporate
culture shock when the "MBA yuppies from Lotus go out to
Provo."
   Both companies have been sharp stock gainers in the past
month as technology stocks came into favor. But on Friday,
investors -- worried that the merger may prove difficult, and
disappointed that Novell holders won't get a premium --
showed their displeasure. In over-the-counter trading, Lotus
stock fell $2 to $34.25. Novell stock fell $4.125 to $38.75.
   The two companies described the combination as a merger of
equals. Lotus will exchange stock equal to the average value
of Novell stock in the past 10 days. It said it will swap
1.19131 Lotus shares for each Novell share. After the merger,
Novell holders will own about 48% of the combined company.
   Lotus's Jim P. Manzi will remain chairman, president and
chief executive officer of the combined company. Raymond
Noorda, Novell's chairman, will become vice chairman and
chief executive of the Novell subsidiary.
   One factor that helped make the agreement possible was
that Mr. Noorda is 66 years old, and doesn't have a clear
successor. Mr. Noorda said he doesn't have any plans to
retire, but acknowledged that the lack of a second in command
"leads to some insecurity among investors."
   Both companies are highly profitable, fast-growing
software concerns. Last year Lotus reported net income of $68
million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $556 million. Sales
had been hampered last year until Lotus finally started
shipping updated versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet during the
summer. This year most analysts expect strong growth.
   Novell reported net income of $48.5 million, or $1.46 a
share, on revenue of $421.9 million for its fiscal year ended
Oct. 28. Novell has about 52% of the market for software that
lets networks of personal computers share printers,
information and programs.
   If the merger works as planned, the two companies will
complement each other. "Our view is this is a powerful
combination. Sales and marketing are very complementary,"
said Mr. Manzi. Lotus expects to sell its network software,
including a new program called Notes, through the resellers
who handle Novell networks. Novell expects Lotus's
salespeople, who deal with big corporations, will help it get
its Netware into more offices.
   In terms of technology, Mr. Manzi said Lotus is making its
applications easy to use in networks where users share
information, rather than only in individual PCs. With Lotus's
backing for Novell, other software vendors may design their
programs to work well with Novell's Netware rather than
emphasizing Microsoft's competing LAN Manager.
   The combined companies may resemble the structure of
Microsoft, analysts said. Microsoft sells both software
applications, such as its Excel spreadsheet, and operating
systems that control the inner workings of computers and
networks. Now Lotus will sell applications software such as
its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and operating systems for networks.
