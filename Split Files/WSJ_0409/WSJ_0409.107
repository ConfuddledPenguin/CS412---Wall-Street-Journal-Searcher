   BRIGHTON, England -- John Hider has spent more than 20
years sweeping streets in this busy seaside town, but now he
has a new cleaning cart and new boss -- both from Madrid.
   Fomento de Obras &amp; Construcciones S.A., known as Focsa,
undercut the homegrown bids and in January took over
Brighton's street-cleaning. "It was a surprise," says Mr.
Hider, who never imagined foreigners would move in to tidy up
Brighton's much-visited parks and piers. But soon the novelty
wore off. "As long as I get a week's money, it doesn't matter
who pays me," he says with a shrug.

   Eventually, deals like Focsa's won't cause even a
short-lived stir, European Community officials say. To hasten
that day, the EC Commission has reignited its campaign to pry
open the public procurement practices of its 12 member
countries, where big government contracts have long been
viewed as subtle subsidies for national companies.
   The stakes are enormous: Assuming the EC push succeeds,
companies will be able to reach across borders to compete for
some $700 billion in yearly contracts from governments and
regulated utilities. "If we had our druthers, we'd druther
see this than anything" connected with the 1992 program, says
George Hall, who watches EC affairs for STC PLC, the British
telecommunications and technology concern.
   Though government procurement is probably the biggest
prize of the 1992 single market plan, it's also Europe's most
protected trove. Until recently, only rarely did a major
contract go to a company from the wrong side of a border.
Cynics doubt there will be much of a change. Despite years of
EC pushing for cross-border competition for government jobs,
civil servants -- out of habit or bias -- still ladle out big
contracts to national favorites, the skeptics say.
   But the mentality seems to be shifting, slowly but surely.
"This nationalism will erode," says J.A. Kay, a professor at
the London Business School. "Most countries are working to
have a less-political management of their industries." The EC
as well is demanding tougher rules on government procurement
and has beefed-up an enforcement team that aims to crack down
on contracting authorities who continue protectionist ways.
   Increasingly, companies are seeking -- and winning -- jobs
away from home. "It's already on the move," says John
Clement, who oversees contracts for Krinkels Beplantings
Maatschappij, a Dutch construction and maintenance company.
"We're doing more in Belgium, West Germany and the U.K."
   But the increase in cross-border contracting stems as much
from corporate restructuring as from rule-making in Brussels.
The past few years have seen a proliferation of cross-border
mergers and joint ventures, both of which tend to scramble
national identities. As a result, government contracting
officers are getting used to working with companies based in
other countries.
   Some concerns even hit pay dirt in the foreign capitals
themselves. Earlier this year, International Computers Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Britain's STC, won a contract to supply the
West German Bundestag with personal computers. Parliament
members in Bonn were won over by the computers' capabilities
and International Computers' promise of good service,
officials involved in the negotiations said.
   U.S. business, meanwhile, is nervous that while
procurement contracts open up within the EC, they'll become
more closed to U.S. bidders. The fears are based on more than
the U.S.'s phobia about Fortress Europe. Last month, EC
ministers agreed to open up government contracts in
telecommunications, energy, transport and water industries,
but they also adopted a "Buy Europe" provision that would
allow procurement officials to throw out bids involving less
than 50% EC content.
   "The Buy-Europe provision wasn't considered a friendly
gesture," says Harry Freeman, who lobbies for a number of
U.S. companies who are pushing for more open trade around the
world. "Things were going fine with 1992 until this
procurement package came along." He and others plan to fight
the controversial amendment at trade talks in progress at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Meanwhile, Europeans say the cross-border competition
isn't embraced with equal enthusiasm throughout the EC.
Complaints about the French abound. "France makes my blood
pressure go up, because it practices blatant protectionism,"
complains Harry Moss, chief executive officer of the U.K.'s
Audioline Ltd., which makes telephones, answering machines
and security systems.
   Britain stands out as one of the most open EC countries,
partly because the Thatcher government has pushed through
legislation requiring procurement authorities to choose low
bidders, no matter where they come from. British officials
don't miss the irony: The U.K., often considered a
recalcitrant EC member, boasts a comparatively open
public-contracting policy, while France, enthusiastic about a
united EC, has a reputation for hoarding government jobs.
   As a hedge against continuing nationalism, companies are
seeking cross-border acquisitions and investments that make
them seem less foreign to procurement officers. "In France,
you take a French disguise," says one company executive
chasing government contracts there.
   Typical is the strategy of West Germany's Holtzman AG.
Last year, in a campaign to win more business in Spain,
Holtzman bought a 50% stake in Jotsa S.A., a construction
company based in Madrid, and entered a cooperation agreement
with Agroman S.A., another construction company.
   The investments and linkups are helping to change the
mind-set of Western Europe's procurement officers. Coleman
Morrissey, materials manager for the Electricity Supply Board
in the Republic of Ireland, says that in recent waves of
acquisitions, many of Europe's cable and transformer
suppliers have been swallowed up by ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG,
the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate, or by Pirelli S.p.A. of
Milan. Procurement officers increasingly expect bidders of
any nationality, he says.
   Spain's Focsa, which didn't link up with a local company
in its move into Britain, concedes it has had to make some
awkward adjustments. The first week Focsa was on the job,
winter gale winds, particularly brutal in Brighton, upended
several street-cleaning buggies that generally traveled
smoothly on sunny Spanish streets.
   Greater turbulence hit when Focsa tried to reassign a
number of elderly women to street-sweeping duties after years
of cleaning public toilets. Though women are well-represented
on street crews in Spain, the Brighton ladies considered the
switch an insulting comedown. After strenuous protests and
many letters to the local newspaper, Focsa dropped the plan,
and the women have returned to their previous assignments.
Meanwhile, the company has yet to recognize the local union,
sparking small strikes and picketing.
   Notwithstanding the frictions in Brighton, Focsa has
landed a street-cleaning contract in Stockport, and officials
expect three or four more in coming months.
