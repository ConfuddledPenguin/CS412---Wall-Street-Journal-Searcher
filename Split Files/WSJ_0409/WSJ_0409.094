   LONDON -- Having risen to prominence through splashy deals
in Britain and the U.S., Grand Metropolitan PLC is looking to
Europe -- but with a softer touch.
   Chairman Allen Sheppard says his company, which currently
derives 90% of its trading profit from Britain and the U.S.,
will mount greater efforts to increase its presence in both
East and West Europe.

   Using the brand names acquired in last year's $5.7 billion
acquisition of Pillsbury Inc., Mr. Sheppard said Grand Met
plans to use the Green Giant frozen food, Haagen Dasz luxury
ice cream and Burger King fast food names as springboards for
wider growth in Europe.
   "We have substantial ambitions there," Mr. Sheppard said
of the company's designs on Europe in the 1990s.
   In the meantime, Grand Met will concentrate on
consolidating its existing businesses after a frantic
expansion period in the late 1980s. But even during its
period of rest, the chairman said the company wouldn't pass
up a chance to pick up a particularly relevant add-on to its
food, drink and retailing businesses.
   Because much of the European food market is highly
fragmented, regionalized, family-owned and diffuse, "we've
got to be very careful," the chairman said. "We could be busy
fools and make an acquisition a week, but we'd probably end
up with bits and pieces of food companies spread across
Europe. The market would wonder why we did it." Instead, Mr.
Sheppard sees a continuing process of "small but relevant"
food acquisitions in Europe during the next several years.
   But some people in London's financial community are
concerned that the company appears too acquisition-hungry and
might be tempted to devour another company as a follow-up to
its Pillsbury purchase. "It's not that Grand Met would be
overly stretched, but thoughts of another deal give people
indigestion," said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
   Grand Met's gearing, or its ratio of debt to shareholders'
funds, stood at nearly 200% immediately after the Pillsbury
acquisition. But the company has worked hard to bring its
balance sheet back in line. With the completion of its
recently announced asset swap with Elders IXL, its gearing
will be sheared to 65%. Once it finds a buyer for Alpo pet
food in the U.S., the level will come down to about 50%.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Sheppard was quick to soothe the nerves
of unconverted critics. "In the foreseeable future, we don't
envisage making another macro bid over #500 million pounds
{$821.1 million}," he said, adding a disclaimer that "unless
we get some fantastic opportunity that comes along which we
just can't and shouldn't resist."
   As for the European drinks operation, Mr. Sheppard said
Grand Met already has well-established and sophisticated
distribution links built up during the past five years in
just about every European country. Joint ventures include
some of the best names in European spirits like Cinzano,
Grand Marnier and Metaxa. The brands owned outright read like
a Who's Who of the drinks world, including J&amp;B Scotch whisky
and Smirnoff vodka.
   Grand Met recently said it is negotiating to buy a 20%
stake in France's Remy Martin for #100 million. The deal
fills what many analysts saw as the last remaining gap in
Grand Met's drinks line-up, an internationally branded
cognac. Remy's portfolio also includes premium label Krug and
Piper-Heidsieck champagnes, orange-flavored liqueur Cointreau
and a number of leading wines.
   In its latest earnings report for the year ended in
September, Grand Met had a 27% leap in pretax profit to #732
million from #575 million a year earlier. Although figures
aren't disaggregated by division and geography, world-wide
drinks business accounted for #2.04 billion in sales and #230
million in trading profit in the latest results, compared
with #1.04 billion and #143 million, respectively, the year
before.
   By sector, 1990 is expected to bring 38% of its trading
profit from drinks, 31% from retailing and 31% from food.
   Grand Met enjoys the position of being the world's largest
wine and spirits seller and the eighth-largest food group.
   There's also a move afoot to bring more of Grand Met's
Burger King restaurants to the Continent. Mr. Sheppard said
the company is exploring opportunities in France, Spain and
West Germany for more exposure. Its purchase of Wimpey in the
United Kingdom has given Grand Met a "more active stance" in
allowing it to push toward the continent. Giving Burger King
a toehold in Europe will start in West Germany, Mr. Sheppard
said.
   Mr. Sheppard sees Eastern Europe as fertile ground for
Green Giant products, where there could be a swap of its
agricultural know-how and technology in exchange for abundant
land and labor. Multinational sourcing of food products has
become a more critical quest for Grand Met recently, Mr.
Sheppard said, especially in light of last year's drought in
the U.S.
   Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany are the natural
areas where the company would look for new business.
