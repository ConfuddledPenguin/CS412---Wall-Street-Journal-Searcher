   TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese leaders are congratulating
themselves for their "historic" report on eliminating
"structural" causes of Japan's persistent trade surplus.
   But the reaction of Albert L. Sieg, a U.S. businessman in
Tokyo, is more subdued. "The parties have agreed at the
negotiating level," said the president of the Eastman Kodak
(Japan) Ltd. subsidiary, and a vice president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "But we've been talking about
negotiations and commitments for a long, long time. The
question is whether there's any follow-through or not. There
isn't any reason Americans shouldn't be skeptical."

   It took four days of around-the-clock bargaining last week
to produce blueprints for reforming the Japanese and U.S.
economies. But the two governments still put off until July
the key question in the minds of American government and
business veterans of the bilateral trade battle: how the
agreement will be monitored and enforced. That, they say,
will determine whether this is truly a turning point, or
largely an academic exercise.
   Japan's 32-page plan is filled with many potentially
significant promises for reform. But they are largely vague
statements about "strictly enforcing" certain laws and
"resorting to more formal actions." Many have been made
before. Even the few specific pledges, such as simplifying
Japan's contorted distribution system, face political hurdles
before they can be adopted.
   And even then, such changes can be effectively thwarted by
other measures. Less than an hour after the talks broke up in
Washington Thursday night, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry held a news conference in Tokyo stressing
the limits of what the Japanese had promised.
   Thus, most Americans invoke the conventional wisdom that
unless the U.S. applies continual pressure, the Japanese
government won't have the power or conviction to fulfill its
promises. "It's imperative that there be a full American
staff in Tokyo with adequate authority to follow up," argues
John P. Stern, head of the American Electronics Association's
Japan office. "I'm concerned the U.S. does not have adequate
resources in Japan to monitor enforcement of the agreement."
   The document released last week was the interim report of
the Structural Impediments Initiative, sweeping discussions
born last year out of frustration with the endless
sector-specific trade haggles. The idea was to knock down
some of the systemic causes of the $49 billion bilateral
trade imbalance. Thus, the focus was on long-term reforms
that likely won't bear fruit soon, such as shifting the
orientation of Japan's economy toward consumption and away
from production. The final report is due by early July.
   On the U.S. side of the ledger, American trade officials
themselves acknowledge that most of the problems are domestic
-- a low savings rate, a high federal budget deficit and poor
public education to name a few. The structural talks are
supposed to be a "two-way street," and the plan to change the
U.S. economy, also released last week, is as vague as the
Japanese. Moreover, the reforms cited may prove even more
difficult to bring about given the political and fiscal
constraints faced by the Bush administration.
   But, as a top member of the American delegation said after
the reports were released, "one side {of the street} is
longer than the other," meaning that most of the pressure
falls on Japan.
   The Japanese plan, if totally implemented as the Americans
understand it, would mean dramatic societal changes,
essentially wresting major decisions from the big businesses
and big government that so heavily rule the economy, and
turning more control over to the free market.
   But Japan has made such pledges before. In 1986,
then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone commissioned a study
under Bank of Japan's former governor, Haruo Maekawa, which
called for "economic structural adjustment for international
harmony." That report helped trigger a major shift in the
Japanese economy from one driven by exports to one pushed by
domestic demand. Yet it failed to deliver many liberalizing
measures, some of which are repeated in last week's report.
   Many of the political obstacles to change three years ago
still exist today. The most significant proposal in Japan's
SII interim plan is an overhaul of a law protecting
inefficient mom-and-pop shops.
   The Americans say the law effectively blocks many foreign
stores from setting up in Japan, and also discourages the
opening of large Japanese stores, which are more likely to
carry imported goods. The Japanese government itself says the
law hurts consumers.
   But any talk of change irritates the politically powerful
1.6 million small retailers. "The decision will do nothing
but weaken minor retailers, devastate shopping districts, and
slow down economic and cultural development of the community,
the Federation of Specialty Stores Associations said in a
statement. The group vowed to do its best to prevent the
decisions from being enforced.
   It has many levers to pull. Some of the changes require
legislative approval, and the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, which has endorsed the package, doesn't control the
upper house of the Diet. The opposition parties may try to
grab even more of the LDP power base by promising to reject
the revisions of the law. So far, however, the opposition has
been surprisingly quiet on the SII proposals.
   The retailers say they will also appeal to local
authorities, who may have the power to enact their own
legislation effectively nullifying any change made at the
national level. A recent survey of a dozen major municipal
governments showed many would consider enacting some sort of
protection if the national changes proved damaging to small
retailers. "There's a concern that the regions will respond
by tightening laws -- they don't feel the pressure from the
U.S.," said Weeks Ringle, a retail analyst with W.I. Carr
(Overseas) Ltd., a unit of France's Banque Indosuez, in
Tokyo.
   Other reforms mentioned in the Japanese package remain
vague. The government said it would increase the penalty for
antitrust violations, but doesn't mention a number. It
promises to increase spending on public works -- a move
Americans say will shift the orientation of the economy
further away from exports and more toward domestic
consumption -- but doesn't specify by how much.
   Some of those details will likely appear in the July
report, and then give a clearer picture about how seriously
the Japanese government takes the U.S. government's demands.
   But other promises require general changes in everday
behavior and attitudes, and are almost impossible to write
into an agreement. Many of the proposals, aimed at curbing
close business ties, rely on a more vigorous Japan Fair Trade
Commission. But even increasing the staff and budget of that
bureaucracy won't guarantee that the commission, which has a
history of lax enforcement, will pursue cases Americans
consider antitrust violations. Some American businessmen fear
a tougher FTC will simply target them. Indeed, a recent JFTC
report concluded that a major cause of high prices in Japan
was high markups by importers.
