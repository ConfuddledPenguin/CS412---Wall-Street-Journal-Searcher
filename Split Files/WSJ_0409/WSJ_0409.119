   Kinark Corp. said it agreed to sell its Camelot Hotels for
$12 million to a private company in California, resulting in
a $6.7 million loss from discontinued operations for the
fourth quarter.
   The operator of chemicals facilities and galvanizing
plants said that the sale resulted in a net loss for 1989 of
$4.7 million, or $1.33 a share. The Tulsa, Okla.-based
company had profit from continuing operations of $2 million,
or 56 cents a share for the year.

   The company, which has been trying to sell the hotels for
some time, said it expects to complete the Camelot sale
within 90 days and use the proceeds to repay bank debt.
