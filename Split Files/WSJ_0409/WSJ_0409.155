   WASHINGTON -- The law enacted by Congress in 1988 to
strengthen taxpayers' rights in dealing with the Internal
Revenue Service has achieved some success, but incidents of
abuse by the powerful agency are still being reported, a
Senate panel was told Friday.
   That mixed report emerged from a Senate Finance
subcommittee hearing on how the IRS is responding to the law,
known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

   IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg said his agency fully
supports the law, and he contended that the IRS has made a
great deal of progress in improving programs dealing with
taxpayer grievances and other taxpayer services.
   "We have made progress, but we clearly need to make more
in the months and years ahead," he said. "Citizens these days
have more rights in proceedings with the IRS than they do
with any other government agency."
   But the subcommittee chairman, Sen. David Pryor, (D.,
Ark.), was skeptical. For instance, he cited claims by a
California businessman that an IRS agent there encouraged a
group of businessmen to "snitch" on competitors who cheat. "I
don't want to ever see any program established in this
country that creates an underground network of IRS spies that
encourages neighbor to turn against neighbor," the lawmaker
said.
   Mr. Goldberg said he wasn't aware of such an incident, but
he said it would be "reprehensible." The IRS commissioner
added that he would put a stop to such efforts if they exist.
   The most emotional moment in the hearings came in
testimony from a widow who told the committee that the IRS
drove her husband to take his own life after the IRS imposed
what turned out to be an unjustified lien on the couple's
property.
   In tearful testimony, Kay M. Council, a 48-year-old widow
from High Point, N.C., said her husband committed suicide in
June 1988, before the taxpayer rights legislation was passed,
so she could use the life-insurance money to fight the IRS.
She eventually won her battle when a federal court ruled that
she didn't owe a penny of the $300,000 in tax, penalties and
interest the IRS sought.
   Among other things, the 1988 law requires that the IRS
notify taxpayers earlier than it has in the past when it
intends to place liens on property; that notices of
additional taxes owed spell out the agency's claims in clear
language; and that taxpayers be notified of their rights.
