   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission's
investment management division has set up a task force to
conduct a sweeping study into the regulation of mutual funds
and other investment companies, the division's head said.
   Kathryn McGrath, the SEC's director of investment
management, said in an interview that the 12-member group
will work for at least a year to "study what should be done
legislatively or by the commission to bring the U.S. system
of regulation" up to date.

   The study will be the first in almost 25 years to take a
comprehensive look at how mutual funds should be registered
and managed and whether the current disclosure process still
works, she said. "We're looking at anything and everything
about investment companies," Ms. McGrath said. "We want to
know anything that's too onerous so that it can be removed.
Anything that's missing we might recommend be added."
   She said the division will issue a release in the next
month or so asking for input from the public and investment
companies on directions the study should take.
   Separately, Ms. McGrath said her division is working on
proposals to tighten the flexibility of money-market funds.
The proposals would focus on making sure that funds aren't
too reliant on a single issuer of short-term paper, she said,
"so that if they hit a bad issuer it won't hurt them as
badly."
   She said the measures were triggered in part by last
year's problems in the bond market and by the difficulties
this year with some issuers of commercial paper. "This will
help make money-market funds a tad safer," Ms. McGrath said.
   Ms. McGrath added that the SEC received a number of
comment letters about a three-pronged proposal to beef up
disclosure of mutual funds. The most controverial measure
would force funds to tell shareholders or prospective
investors who manages the fund and details about that
manager's business experience.
   Ms. McGrath said industry comments generally opposed the
proposal, as had been expected. Industry officials have
argued that such disclosure would create a star system in the
industry and that many funds are run by teams of managers,
rather than a single individual.
   The SEC said at the time it issued the proposal, however,
that it received more than 300 letters from investors
supporting management disclosure after it proposed a similar
requirement for closed-end mutual funds.
   Ms. McGrath also said industry reaction was cool to a
second proposal that would require funds to state in
prospectuses how well they met investment goals for the prior
year.
   But the industry and others backed the third measure, she
said, which would add a line to the prospectus to show a
fund's 10-year total return, or performance plus dividends.
"That's really the bottom line of what an investor would make
from making an investment," she said.
