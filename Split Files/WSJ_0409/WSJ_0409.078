   NEW YORK -- Risk is supposed to get rewarded, but lately
that hasn't been the case for investors in bond mutual funds.
   Among fixed-income funds, the first-quarter leaders were
the drab but safe money market funds. They posted a quarterly
gain of nearly 2%, not huge, but better than any other
category ranked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.

   The first quarter was the worst period for bond funds
since mid-1987. As interest rates spiked upward in the
quarter, with the yield on benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds
jumping 0.66 percentage point to 8.63%, people who took the
risk of buying longer-maturity bonds got clobbered.
   And so the money market funds lead the fixed-income pack,
and beat most categories of stock funds in the quarter,
according to Lipper's quarterly rankings. The exception:
funds specializing in science and technology stocks, which
posted a first-quarter gain of 2.7%.
   Money market funds -- which generally hold the very
short-term corporate IOUs known as commercial paper and
Treasury bills with less than three months to maturity -- did
better than funds holding bonds with maturities of one to
five years. And those shorter-term bond funds, in turn, did
better than funds with longer-maturity bonds.
   Investors weren't rewarded for taking credit risks,
either. Corporate bond funds holding the lower-rated but
still investment grade BBB bonds lagged behind those with
A-rated paper.
   Hardest hit of all were those funds holding bonds rated
below investment grade, the junk bond funds. These
high-yielding bond funds were trounced for a 4% loss in the
quarter, worse even than the average stock fund. That 4% loss
-- which reflects both price changes and dividends paid to
fund shareholders -- brings the total 12month loss for junk
funds to 6.6%.
   But for most bond fund investors, the worst may be over.
"There may have been a turnaround in March," says A. Michael
Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "In almost all cases,
the bond funds were up in March on a total-return basis. Is
that the beginning of a trend? I don't know."
   Convertible bond funds led the March rebound with a rise
of 1.5%, and junk funds were the second best performing group
with a gain of 1.1%.
   "{The junk bond market} is in its bottoming phase," says
Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager with Dreyfus Corp. "I
don't think all the bad news is out. Clearly, we're still
seeing companies having problems with profitability. We're
also continuing to see a problem with liquidity in the
market. I don't think the market could take any sort of
selling pressure."
   Nevertheless, after eight consecutive months of
hemorrhaging by junk funds, investors now seem to be putting
more money into junk funds than they are pulling out.
   Municipal bond funds were popular with investors
throughout the first quarter. "This may be a seasonal factor,
as people realize the amount of tax they have to pay," says
Mr. Lipper.
   Demand from small investors, plus a relative dearth of new
issues, helped buoy the municipal bond market. Municipal bond
funds generally posted gains for the quarter, with tax-exempt
money market funds leading the way.
   In the taxable fund market, Ms. Kenworthy says the spread
between inflation and the yield on longer-term bonds now is
quite attractive. "With inflation at 4 1/2%, you have a
bargain in the bond market," she reckons. "I think the market
is too bearish on what's going to happen on the inflation
front."
   While money market funds fared well in the quarter, they
don't look nearly so hot if you look at the past 12 months.
In that period, the biggest gains were notched by Ginnie Mae
funds and Treasury bond funds. The Ginnie Mae funds invest in
securities of the Government National Mortgage Association
that are backed by federally guaranteed mortgages.
