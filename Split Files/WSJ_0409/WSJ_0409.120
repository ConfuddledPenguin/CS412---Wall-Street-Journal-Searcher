   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm
G.m.b.H. signed a memorandum of understanding to link up its
helicopter manufacturing business with that of the French
aerospace group Aerospatiale S.A.
   The MBB-Aerospatiale joint venture will control about 30%
of the world market for helicopters, the companies said, and
have annual sales of more than 10 billion French francs
($1.75 billion). The new company will be the world's
second-largest helicopter manufacturer behind the Sikorski
helicopter subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based United
Technologies Corp., and ahead of the Bell Helicopter Textron
unit of Textron Inc., Providence, R.I.

   MBB, which is a subsidiary of West Germany's largest
industrial group, Daimler-Benz AG, and Aerospatiale said they
plan to set up a French holding company to be called
Eurocopter S.A. to house the partners' respective helicopter
operations.
   State-owned Aerospatiale said the linkup of the two
helicopter lines "has been undertaken to boost
competitiveness and sharpen their ability to penetrate the
world market." Other aerospace groups will be invited to join
the venture, according to MBB.
   The West German and French partners have cooperated in
limited helicopter activities in recent years. They currently
are working together on the "Tiger" combat helicopter
project, as well as the NH-90 military helicopter program for
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   News of an impending Eurocopter venture emerged in early
March, when Aerospatiale officials confirmed that talks were
under way.
   The Aerospatiale helicopter joint venture is the latest of
a series of business links Daimler has been arranging
worldwide. Two weeks ago, Daimler agreed to link up its
civilian aircraft-engine business with the Pratt &amp; Whitney
division of United Technologies.
   Citing that business tie with Pratt &amp; Whitney, General
Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., last week sued Daimler for
breach of a previous agreement to cooperate exclusively with
GE in the area of highthrust jet engines. Daimler said Friday
it sees "no grounds" for the legal action.
   Meanwhile, Daimler also last month said it is discussing
far-reaching business links with the Mitsubishi group of
companies of Japan.
   For Aerospatiale, the cooperation pact with Daimler would
help it respond to French government pressure on industrial
groups to expand their industrial bases via alliances with
other European companies. Aerospatiale is Europe's largest
helicopter manufacturer, with sales of eight billion French
francs a year.
   Aerospatiale and MBB began exploring a cooperative venture
in the helicopter sector more than a year ago, but those
discussions were suspended while Daimler undertook the
controversial takeover of MBB.
