   Last month, the oil and gas concern said it had received
several unsolicited inquiries from other oil and gas concerns
about a possible transaction.
   Based on its 2.7 million shares outstanding and its
closing stock price Friday of $6 in American Stock Exchange
composite trading, the company has an estimated value of
$16.2 million.
   In 1989, Baruch-Foster had a net loss of $272,326, or 10
cents a share, on revenue of $8.9 million.
