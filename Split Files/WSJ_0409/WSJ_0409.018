   A Hard Day's Bite

   At the end of the day
   When we've been away
   Stalking the corporate beast,
   We return to the nest
   Hoping to rest
   And share in a hard-earned feast.
   We're too tired to cook
   So we hungrily look
   Through the house with primeval anxiety.
   We eat what we find
   And again, we're aligned
   With a hunting-and-gathering society.
   -- Pat D'Amico.

   Channel Confusion
                                                                                                       

   Our TV viewing habits
   Should make us quite uneasy,
   As we honor the serious shows,
   But watch those that are sleazy.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   Secret Device
                                                                                                       

   To err is human. To do it when no one's around is divine.
   -- Frank Walsh.
