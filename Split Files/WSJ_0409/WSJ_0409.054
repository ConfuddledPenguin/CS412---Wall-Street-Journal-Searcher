   CURRAGH RESOURCES Inc., a closely held mining concern,
said it filed a prospectus for an international initial
public offering of shares to raise gross proceeds of about
$80 million (U.S.). The Toronto-based company said it will
offer 6,250,000 subordinate voting shares from its treasury
at about $13 each. In addition, it said Australia's Giant
Resources Ltd., which owns 44% of Curragh, will sell
2,750,000 shares, reducing its stake to about 21%. Adrian
White, Curragh's executive vice president, finance, said the
company will assist Giant in selling privately the rest of
its Curragh shares as part of Giant's previously reported
plan to dispose of its Canadian mining assets. Giant is 43%
owned by Pioneer International Ltd., one of Australia's
biggest companies, which has announced plans to sell its
stake in Giant. The public offering represents about 27% of
Curragh's shares. Mr. White said Frame Mining Corp., a
company controlled by Clifford Frame, Curragh's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, will hold about 90% of
the voting power through its holding of Curragh multiple
voting shares. Mr. White said proceeds of the offering will
be used to repay long-term debt, which stood at 213 million
Canadian dollars (US$182.3 million) at Dec. 31. He said
Curragh also will probably issue $100 million (U.S.) in
debentures later this year.
