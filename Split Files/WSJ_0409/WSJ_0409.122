   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Group Inc. said it signed an
agreement to conduct a preliminary study aimed at turning a
Soviet Union research community into an area similar to
California's Silicon Valley.
   Bechtel said the study is part of a plan to convert
Troitsk, located about 20 miles from Moscow, into a
"entrepreneurial, high-technology city." Troitsk is now the
site of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, where much
of the country's scientific research is conducted.

   Bechtel said there are plans to upgrade the area's
airport, and install advanced telecommunications facilities
at Troitsk. Also, Bechtel said it's hoped that a conference
center, an international hotel, "U.S.-style housing" and
recreational facilities will be developed. Terms of the
agreement weren't disclosed.
   The closely held engineering and construction concern said
it's too early to estimate the cost of the project, but said
the Soviets have indicated they plan to spend $100 million a
year to build a series of such high-tech communities. With
the plan, Bechtel said, the Soviets "hope to convert their
purely research facilities at Troitsk into a series of
entrepreneurial ventures capable of jump-starting their
nation's faltering economy."
