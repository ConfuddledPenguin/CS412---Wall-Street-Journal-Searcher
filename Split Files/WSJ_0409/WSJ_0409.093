   FIGGIE INTERNATIONAL Inc., of Willoughby, Ohio, said its
board authorized the purchase of as many as 275,133 of its
Class B common shares. The company said it is taking the
action to restore a ratio between Class A and Class B shares
that existed before a tender offer for both classes of stock
in September. At that time, shareholders tendered three
million shares of Class A stock, the number the company said
it would buy, but only 834,867 shares of Class B stock, which
was less than the 1.1 million shares the company sought.
Shares are adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split in January.
Figgie's businesses include fire protection and other
security products and services, electronics, sporting goods
and industrial equipment.
