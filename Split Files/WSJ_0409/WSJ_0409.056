   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands -- It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
   Rotterdam is a massive center for oil refining, trading
and shipping. Hence, it ought to have a thriving
energy-futures market, where the oil industry could hedge its
pricing risks and speculators could bet on the direction of
oil prices -- just as they do at exchanges in London, New
York and Singapore.

   Such reasoning was rife when the Rotterdam Energy Futures
Exchange, or Roefex, opened for trading last Oct. 31. But
trading on the exchange started off modestly and quickly
slowed. Proximity to oil refineries and barges hasn't yet
proved an advantage; the customers Roefex wants to attract
have no trouble dealing with the established exchanges,
however distant.
   Now, a new management team is trying to revive the Roefex.
Robert Sandelowsky, who became managing director of the
exchange March 1, is visiting its legions of inactive
members, giving them pep talks and discussing how to generate
trading volume.
   Currently, the Roefex's contracts for crude oil and fuel
oil have ceased trading. For the gas oil (or heating oil)
contract, there is still a trickle of turnover. On a recent
day, the Roefex had 137 gas oil contracts outstanding,
compared with well over 30,000 on London's moderately
successful International Petroleum Exchange and more than
70,000 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   "People don't take time to look at the Roefex any more
because the volume isn't there," says Steve Rietbergen,
director of Anglo-Dutch Oil Services, London, whose firm had
traders on the Roefex floor for the first three weeks before
giving up. Only six traders remain on the floor.
   What went wrong? For one thing, the oil market has been
relatively quiet in recent months. But many oil traders say
the real problem is that the Roefex was ill-conceived and
poorly marketed.
   A common charge is that the Roefex failed to come up with
anything novel enough to tempt business away from London's
IPE, which opened in 1981. "They basically mirrored the
established market, the IPE," says Peter Coster, a senior oil
trader at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in London. In a minor novelty,
the Roefex offered the possibility of physical delivery
(rather than cash settlement) for its crude-oil contract, but
that idea already had flopped in London.
   The Roefex did manage to attract a huge number of members
-- 160 -- but few of them were active. Roefex seats were
priced so low-25,000 guilders (about $13,000) each, compared
with around $250,000 on the New York Mercantile Exchange --
that many traders apparently bought them merely on the chance
that the seat value would soar if Roefex took off.
   Critics both inside and outside the Roefex also say that
its original management team lacked experience in energy
futures. As a result, the critics say, some needlessly
cumbersome rules discouraged potential traders. Meanwhile,
some members were unhappy with the amount of time devoted to
the exchange by its chairman, Tjerk Westerterp, who also
heads the successful European Options Exchange in Amsterdam.
Mr. Westerterp spends only a small amount of his time at the
Roefex, traders say, and in the early days few decisions
could be made in his absence. Mr. Westerterp, who remains on
the Roefex board but has been eclipsed in day-to-day duties
by Mr. Sandelowsky, who would not comment.
   Many members are encouraged, however, by the look of the
new team. Mr. Sandelowsky also serves as the general manager
of the three-year-old Amsterdam Financial Futures Market and
is credited with having played a major role in its success.
Because the financial futures exchange now "is rolling on its
own power," Mr. Sandelowsky says, he has time to run the
Roefex as well.
   Mr. Sandelowsky, who plans to concentrate for now on
building up gas oil rather than the other two contracts, says
many members remain "quite positive" about the Roefex despite
the bleak performance so far. But he concedes that the
pressure is on: One of the leading floor traders says his
firm will cut its losses and pull out if trading volume
doesn't pick up within a few months.
