   When President Bush decides to deliver another "War on
Drugs" speech to the nation, it may not be necessary for the
Drug Enforcement Agency to stage a drug buy at Lafayette
Park. Perhaps all the president has to do is phone Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh and ask him to step outside his
office and into the halls of the Justice Department.
   Late last month, on a trip to Washington, I found myself
at the Justice Department, about to attend a meeting a floor
below Mr. Thornburgh's office. Upon entering the building,
like all visitors, I provided some identification and stated
the purpose of the visit and the office at which I was
expected. After those details were recorded and verified, I
passed through a metal detector and my belongings were
checked by an X-ray machine. I completed the security check
and continued on my way to my meeting, in the firm belief
that the building must be one of the most crime-free in the
capital.

   I was very tired that day and it must have showed. The
Justice Department headquarters is a rather large and complex
building, and it is easy to get lost in its long corridors.
As I was rounding one corner, I saw packages and boxes out of
the corner of my eye and a person who seemed to approach me
from this area suddenly moved and blocked my way. Imagine my
shock and surprise when this rather thin, casually dressed
young man who appeared to be in his 20s said, "Wanna fix?" I
was so startled, I stopped and stared. He repeated his
question while taking something out of his pocket and quickly
opened his palm revealing a small, shiny white square.
Dumbfounded, I made no reply but instinctively moved out of
his way and down the corridor to the first open doorway of an
office suite seeking help.
   As I walked outraged into the room, the full impact of
what had just happened dawned on me, and I said to the people
in the office that somebody had tried to sell me drugs just
outside their office in the corridor. They didn't seem
surprised, nor shocked, nor did they feel impelled to do
anything. Their response simply was, "Really?" When I
suggested that they check the corridor and see if he was
still there, I got no response. They were not interested and
went on with their work as though nothing had happened. When
I was able to get myself collected, I left their office and
continued on my way.
   Later I called the office responsible for security in the
Justice Department and gave it the details of the incident.
When I inquired if something like this had ever been reported
before, the answer was no. The security people, however, were
very anxious to take down the details of what had happened.
   I suppose it is possible that I was the victim of a prank.
But Bush administration officials have just admitted that the
war on drugs has been a failure in the streets of Washington.
Perhaps it has failed in the corridors of power as well. If
one can be offered drugs in the halls of the Justice
Department in Washington, it seems reasonable to suspect that
the "Colombianization" of the U.S. is here now.
