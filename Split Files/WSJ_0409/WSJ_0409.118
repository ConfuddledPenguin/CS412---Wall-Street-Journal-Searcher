   BOSTON -- Eliot Bank reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$30.5 million, or $16.25 a share, and said regulators may
appoint a receiver if it fails to restore net capital to the
required level.
   Results included a $23.8 million provision for loan
losses, as troubled real estate loans contributed to a surge
in nonperforming assets. In the year-earlier period, Eliot
earned $165,000, or nine cents a share.

   The bank warned that its net capital is "significantly
below the minimum required" by regulators and that failure to
raise the capital could cause the Massachusetts Commissioner
of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to "take
such actions as they consider appropriate, including the
possible appointment of a receiver for the bank."
   Eliot is the second Massachusetts bank in recent days to
warn of the possibility that regulators might appoint a
receiver. Home National Corp. of Milford, Mass., last week
used nearly identical wording in disclosing a capital
shortfall.
   At Dec. 31, 1989, Eliot's total assets were $489.3 million
and stockholder equity was negative $13.8 million.
Nonperforming assets were $133.9 million at year end,
comprised of $104.3 million in nonaccruing loans and $29.6
million in foreclosed and "in substance foreclosure"
property.
   Eliot said it has reduced its reliance on borrowed funds
and other volatile liabilities.
   For 1989, Eliot reported a loss of $50.5 million, or
$26.89 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $2.8
million, or $1.47 a share.
