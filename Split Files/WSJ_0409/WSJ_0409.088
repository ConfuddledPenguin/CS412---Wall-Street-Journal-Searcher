   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's five leading
research institutes revised their economic-growth forecasts
upward sharply for both this year and next, the newspaper
Welt am Sonntag reported.
   The research institutes are now projecting 1990 growth
could reach 4%, equal to last year's strong expansion and
above their earlier estimates of between 3% and 3.5%, the
newspaper said. They revised their growth forecast for 1991
to 3.5% from 2.5%.

   The institutes said the unification of the two Germanys
was giving the economy an extra push. Their spring report
won't be officially released until today.
