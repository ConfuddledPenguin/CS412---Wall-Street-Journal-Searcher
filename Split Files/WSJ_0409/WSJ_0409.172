   NEW YORK -- KeyCorp expects to report first-quarter
earnings of 83 cents to 88 cents a share, generally in line
with securities analysts' estimates.
   Earnings rose about 17% from last year's first-quarter
results of 72 cents a share, or $31 million.

   William H. Dougherty, chief financial officer of the
Albany, N.Y.-based banking company, said in an interview, "We
will be comfortably within the range of analysts' estimates."
Mr. Dougherty said the improved results will come from
operations and not from nonrecurring items, except for a
small gain on the sale of securities.
   For the full year, he said that KeyCorp earnings will be
"at the lower end" of the $3.60 to $3.70-a-share range of
analysts' estimates, as a result of the less robust economic
environment and harsh regulatory climate. Last year, KeyCorp
had earnings of $136.9 million, or $3.20 a share.
   "We decided that it would not be wise to be pushing hard
to increase loan demand in this environment," Mr. Dougherty
said.
   Nonperforming loans, he added, are expected to rise
slightly to 1.55% of total loans from 1.45% at the end of
1989.
   Mr. Dougherty said KeyCorp's Maine bank recently was
examined by bank regulators and that "no adjustments
whatsoever" were made to the bank's portfolio of problem
loans.
   At its Alaska bank, nonperforming assets will fall to 8%
from its peak of 12%. "Alaska has bottomed out, and we will
be reporting a profit in Alaska this year," Mr. Dougherty
said.
   In addition, Mr. Dougherty said KeyCorp has a small
exposure in real estate, a problem area for many banks. Out
of a loan portfolio totaling $9.9 billion at year end,
condominium and construction loans total only $56 million and
$438 million, respectively, he said.
