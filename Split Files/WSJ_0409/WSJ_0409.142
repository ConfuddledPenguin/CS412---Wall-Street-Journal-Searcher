   UAL'S OUTLOOK REMAINS uncertain despite Friday's agreement
to be acquired by United Air's unions for $4.38 billion. The
buy-out itself may take several more months to complete, and
much will depend on how well the unions get along among
themselves and management. Moreover, the carrier has been so
preoccupied with possible buy-outs that it has steadily lost
ground to competitors.

   The Group of Seven industrial nations voiced concern about
the weak yen and hinted it might continue intervening to
bolster the currency. But the group, which met Saturday in
Paris, brushed aside Japanese calls for coordinated
interest-rate moves.

   The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.3% the
month before. Still, many analysts were disappointed by the
meager growth in new jobs, a sign that the economy remains
sluggish. Manufacturing jobs declined during the month.
                                                                                                       

   Another surge of layoffs has begun in all sectors of the
economy. The cutbacks reflect the junk bond market's slide,
retailers' troubles and further corporate retrenchments.
