   To Soviet Executive President Mikhail Sergeyevich

<TEXT>
   Mr. President, I've read the speech you made after you
were inaugurated as the new executive president. I didn't
even have to go to the CIA for it. I just called up your
consulate in San Francisco and got it. Full text. I'm a
believer in reading the text. What did the man himself say?
Never mind what the reporter said he said.
   So I read it and, as always, Mikhail Sergeyevich, you
light up the landscape with your ideas. It was a bold and
powerful speech. You speak about "genuine people power."
About "building a rule-of-law country." Then you say, "No
system of power can replace morality, which is necessary in
any given society." You say: "In the past, the inner
development of the individual in this country was denigrated
as idealism, but now we have to pay a dear price for this. We
need a different conscientious attitude to work, science,
education and the arts, to culture in the broadest sense of
the word." You say: "We need to create conditions for all
spiritual values to be appreciated in society as a vital
condition for full-bloodied life and progress."
   Mikhail Sergeyevich, I love to hear you say such things.
You're right on the mark. These are good words. And here's
what you say on the subject of governance:
   "I proceed from the premise that the adoption of measures
to strengthen the sovereignty of the Union republics and
their economic and political independence and to enhance the
status of autonomous republics and other national territorial
entities should become a special concern of the presidency. .
. . To confirm the republics' sovereignty and their right to
self-determination, including secession, as specified in the
Constitution, the Supreme Soviet should consider and define a
lawful mechanism for secession from the Union as soon as
possible."
   Well, those again are significant statements. You seem to
envisage a looser federation combined with the idea of
self-determination. I might note that if you manage to put
your country on a system where markets, not political central
governments, make the decisions, then some of the strains
that go with the ethnic differences will be moderated. Also,
remember, borders are not what they used to be. If you will
let them be open, let people cross them easily, then you can
moderate some of the strains.
   In your speech, you go to the heart of the problem of
governance in this day and age. Today, all sizable countries
-- and lots of smaller ones -- face diversity: ethnic
diversity, intense national aspirations, cultural diversity,
religious diversity. That's characteristic of our world. It
can't be stamped out. It won't be stamped out. And we
shouldn't want to stamp it out.
   So those who govern have to welcome the diversity and
learn how to manage it. Some countries have had reasonable
success in doing this. The U.S. has. Canada has. In a very
different way, Switzerland has. A lot of countries, however,
have come a cropper. Look at the problems of even a small
country such as Fiji, with its Fijian-Indian problem, or Sri
Lanka with the tensions generated by the Tamil minority. We
see the problem the world over.
   Which brings me, Mikhail Sergeyvich, to Lithuania. Let's
look at the facts. First of all, the Lithuanians want their
independence. Nobody has any doubt about that. I hear some of
your spokesmen question it because the Lithuanians haven't
had a plebiscite. But they have had the closest thing to a
plebiscite that you can get. I saw a statement of yours that
acknowledged that fact, although you said that you doubted
their wisdom in wanting independence. Still they want it.
   I thought you very astutely laid the predicate for
accepting Lithuanian independence when you unearthed the
infamous von Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and denounced it along
with the Hitler-Stalin deal. Then your Supreme Soviet voted
that the annexation of Lithuania and the other Baltic
countries was illegal. Knowing you are a lawyer, I thought
you were laying the groundwork for their realization of that
independence and also for differentiating the Baltic states
from the other republics in the U.S.S.R.
   As you know, I'm not in a position to speak for the U.S.
anymore. But let me tell you what I would say if I were:
   As far as the U.S. is concerned, it's not a question of
secession. We never recognized the annexation of the Baltic
states by the Soviet Union in the first place. So we stand
with the Lithuanians. They want independence. They are
independent. I have walked by their flag hanging in the lobby
of the State Department many times. We recognized Lithuania
and we have done so continuously since 1940. I thought that
just perhaps when you declared that annexation to be illegal,
as your Supreme Soviet did only a few months ago, you were
coming around to the same point of view.
   But your use of the Soviet army in Lithuania and the
recent passage of a Soviet law setting up a five-year process
governing secession cut against the logic of your own
position. And it means negotiation under duress. This
combination of Soviet military power and after-the-fact
legislation can in the long run only produce an agreement
that will be regarded -- by the Lithuanian people and the
world -- as unequal and illegitimate.
   Therefore, Mikhail Sergeyevich, reverse the order of these
proceedings: Take the Soviet army out of its threatening
positions in Lithuania, announce your acceptance of
Lithuanian independence and then -- under really equal terms
-- negotiate the details of the separation.
   Finally, Mr. President, let me remind you that this is the
information age. Let me quote Lech Walesa from a statement he
made last fall when conditions in Poland were still dicey. He
said:
   "Technology enforces certain solutions. Satellite dishes,
computers, videos, international telephone lines force
pluralism and freedom onto a society. Today Stalin is
impossible. Now you say, what about China? The future
monuments in China will be to those who have been shot. China
will come back to pluralism, democracy and freedom. They
won't be able to destroy all our television sets. People
can't do without telephones. Of course, technological history
can't be turned back. That's why I'm so certain about
victory."
   Mr. President, we live in a world where people know what's
going on. There's a kind an inherent transparency that we
should continue to build up. It is in your interest to do so.
   Mikhail Sergeyevich, you are a great leader, and you have
established a place that is unique in many respects. A new
world order is forming -- not just a new European order but
truly a new world order. What we need right now are statesmen
of the caliber of those who guided us in the West at the end
of World War II, and gave us the liberal, open political and
economic system that has worked so well. We are at a moment
in history that comes perhaps only every half-century; there
is a chance to design the shape of what's ahead of us. And
you, Mr. President, are not only a man of action but
obviously also a man of ideas. Stay on board. Continue to be
a part of this new drama. We need you.
