   HOUSTON -- Seitel Inc. said it formed a joint venture with
Digicon Geophysical Corp. to acquire Digicon's existing
proprietary seismic data library. Seitel said it intended to
offer one million common shares to help pay for the venture.
   The venture, to be known as Digitel Data, will be paid for
by a $4 million nonrecourse loan from Seitel, collateralized
by the venture's data bank. With the loan proceeds, the
venture will buy Digicon's rights to a seismic data bank of
9,500 miles of U.S. onshore seismic data and 155,000 miles of
offshore data. Seitel's loan will be repaid through revenue
from the licensing of this data.

   Seitel said it intended to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a proposed public offering of one million
shares of common stock. Half the issue, 500,000 shares, will
be newly issued; 350,000 will be offered by its principal
stockholder, Helm Resources Inc.; 150,000 shares will be
offered by three individual stockholders. Seitel's proceeds
from the sale will go to pay for the proposed joint venture
with Digicon and for other purposes.
   Seitel develops proprietary seismic data and arranges the
acquisition and marketing of that data. Based in Houston,
Digicon is currently operating under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code; approval of the bankruptcy court is
necessary to complete the transaction, as well as consent
from Digicon's principal lender.
