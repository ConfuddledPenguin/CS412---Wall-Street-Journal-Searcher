   Ad agency executives with visions of breaking away to set
up their own shops can take hope from a breakaway group in
California that has won the first round in its fight for
independence.
   Thus far, a federal district judge in Los Angeles has
ruled in favor of the little guys. If the group is ultimately
successful, the case may provide an object lesson in how to
break away -- and allow old clients to follow -- without
spending a fortune in litigation.

   That wasn't the case when a group of top executives broke
away from WPP Group's Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein to set
up a rival shop, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners. Several
Lord Geller clients defected to the new agency, prompting
Lord Geller to sue for breach of fiduciary duty, among other
things. Last fall, the Lord Einstein renegades and Young &amp;
Rubicam, which gave the new agency financial backing, agreed
to pay $7 million to settle the suit.
   The California case involves a group of executives who
resigned in January from ad agency AC&amp;R's health-care unit,
based in Irvine. The four executives, virtually all of the
health care unit's top management, immediately started their
own new ad agency, Esprit Communications, in Costa Mesa. At
least four AC&amp;R clients have defected to Esprit since then,
including Beckman Instruments and a Baxter International
health-care unit. Other clients are in negotiations to make
the switch.
   "We have notices of termination from seven or eight
clients, and admissions that {most} are negotiating with
those people" at Esprit, says AC&amp;R's attorney, Maggie Heim.
   AC&amp;R, a unit of giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, filed suit
against the tiny new agency in early February. The suit
charges Esprit and its principals with breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, and violating trade secrets, among
other claims. It seeks at least $4 million in compensatory
damages and unspecified punitive damages.
   But last week, in a severe setback, it lost its motion for
a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented Esprit
from doing business with AC&amp;R's clients for two years. In his
decision, Judge James M. Ideman held that AC&amp;R didn't show "a
combination of probable success on the merits and the
possibility of irreparable injury." The decision effectively
allows Esprit to take any and all AC&amp;R clients who approach
it.
   Indeed, in his opinion, the judge chastised AC&amp;R for
seeking the injunction. Esprit, he said, "will be most likely
forced out of business" if the injunction is granted. What's
more, he chided AC&amp;R for complaining about breaches of
contracts by its clients: AC&amp;R "is attempting to hold
defendants liable for alleged breaches by its own clients,
instead of suing those clients," he said.
   AC&amp;R's lawyer, Ms. Heim, says she is considering an
appeal, and that in any case she is proceeding to a trial.
"We still feel we have a really good damage claim," she says.
She adds that the Lord Geller suit hasn't been helpful to her
case because "unfortunately it isn't a published opinion, and
it's two different courts."
   The Lord Geller case clearly has helped Esprit's
principals and others like them learn a lesson, though. That
case largely hinged on whether the breakaway group solicited
Lord Geller clients before they left Lord Geller, a question
never settled in open court. "We were real aware of the
solicitation issue, and very careful not to solicit because
of all the instances where this has been an issue," says
Elizabeth Hargreaves, an Esprit partner. "We definitely
sought legal counsel so we would do it in a way that was
legally sound."
   That doesn't mean the Esprit group is home free. AC&amp;R
contends that the Esprit executives did solicit clients while
still at AC&amp;R, and vows to prove it in court. And even Ms.
Hargreaves concedes that exactly what constitutes
solicitation is a fuzzy matter.
   The case is coming out in favor of the little guys so far,
but lawyers caution that could be reversed -- and even if it
isn't, it won't necessarily set any precedents because such
cases depend on the particular set of facts involved. But
they say the legacy of the Lord Geller case is that
executives even thinking of breaking away are taking a much
harder look at possible legal troubles, especially the
solicitation of clients or employees.
   "The Lord Geller situation brought to the fore many of
these legal issues," says David Versfelt, a lawyer with
Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine. "I think there are an
awful lot of advertising people out there who are more
sensitive to the legal traps of the situation than there were
before."

   Consolidation at Heileman
                                                                                                       

   G. Heileman Brewing, which has five agencies creating ads
for its many beer brands, said it plans to consolidate its
advertising at one agency.
   Executives close to Heileman said financial pressures at
its parent company, Bond Corp. Holdings, were causing budgets
on the individual brands to be diminished. But Ian Crichton,
Heileman senior executive vice president, marketing and
sales, said Heileman will spend more on advertising its
brands this year than it ever has, estimating the total
expenditure at $20 million to $25 million.
   "We feel we'll get a bigger bang for our buck with one
agency," Mr. Crichton said.
   Four Heileman agencies agreed to participate in the
review. One, Young &amp; Rubicam, declined. Since 1986, Young &amp;
Rubicam has handled Heileman's biggest brand, Old Style, and
other brands including Special Export. People close to the
agency said the shop questioned Heileman's ability to
financially support the brands. An agency spokeswoman
declined to comment except to say, "We're extremely proud of
our relationship and our work."
   The other agencies are W.B. Doner, which handles Colt 45;
Chiat/Day/Mojo, which handles Rainier and Lone Star; Borders,
Perrin &amp; Norrander; and Della Femina, McNamee WCRS. A
decision is expected by June 1.
   Two outside agencies probably will be invited to
participate in the review. Industry executives said one will
be Campbell-Mithun-Esty, Chicago, a unit of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi. C-M-E, however, currently handles the Corona beer
account, a piece of business that would be a conflict. The
agency declined to comment.
