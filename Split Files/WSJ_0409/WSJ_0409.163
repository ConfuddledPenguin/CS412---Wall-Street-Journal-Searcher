   SUN MICROSYSTEMS Inc. said it called for redemption of all
its outstanding 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures
due Feb. 15, 2012. The debentures may be redeemed for cash or
conversion to common stock on May 7, 1990. In addition, the
Mountain View, Calif., supplier of computing systems,
workstations and software said it filed an amended
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to approximately 5.1 million common
shares, the maximum number of shares issuable in connection
with the conversion of the debentures.
