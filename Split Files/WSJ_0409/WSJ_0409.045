   Democracy is transforming the globe, yet a curious
consensus holds that the U.S. -- the oldest, richest and
prototypically successful democracy -- is declining. Paul
Kennedy and the New York Review of Books brigade see a
pitiful giant awash in deficits and overcommitments. Pat
Buchanan and many National Review types doubt there can ever
be a meaningful reform of communism, or even that democracy
is a good thing. And those in the center, such as George
Bush, while certainly favoring the tide of freedom, see the
U.S. role in its extension as that of a prep-school
cheerleader: Hooray for Gorbachev and Deng, but don't expect
us to do anything serious to influence them.
   Joseph Nye's "Bound to Lead" (Basic Books, 307 pages,
$19.95) is a potent tonic for this malaise: a brisk
counterassertion that the U.S. is, and likely will remain,
the most powerful country on Earth. With so many questioning
whether America even has substantial leverage, "Bound to
Lead" delivers a critical face-slap to the waning-empire
hand-wringers.

   In the first five chapters, Mr. Nye coolly analyzes the
hard numbers on the history of declining powers, the relative
position of the U.S. today, and the standing of our likely
rivals: the Soviet Union, China, Japan and Europe. By many
macroeconomic measures, such as gross national product, or
various indices of technical innovation, Mr. Nye notes, the
U.S. has held its own and even advanced in the 1980s. Only
when compared with the years just after World War II does the
U.S. register substantial reduction. And one could hardly
expect or even want our unusual position in 1945 to remain
frozen.
   The U.S. "personal savings rate," he admits, has dropped
-- but it is a hollow statistic that excludes many types of
investment in the future, such as spending for education or a
rise in stock prices. When these are factored in, "U.S.
capital formation comes to 30% of GNP," roughly the average
(34%) of 10 other leading industrial countries. Likewise, the
trade deficits that hypnotize decline-mongerers reflect an
influx of foreign investment, most of it counted as
"imports," as well as a reduction in imprudent loans abroad,
which showed up as 1970s "exports."
   But no sooner has Mr. Nye debunked some of these bogus
aggregates than he, alas, picks up some of their baggage. He
harps on the U.S. budget deficit as a major problem; yet it
is not huge compared with that of most countries. He pins the
U.S. deficit, in turn, largely on tax-rate cuts that in fact
brought in a gush of revenues, particularly from the wealthy.
Mr. Nye seems to favor many of the high-tax, special-subsidy
schemes that in the '70s really did cause U.S. decline.
   A political scientist, Mr. Nye is especially cogent when
he considers the subtle, indirect uses of power. He argues
that the U.S. and other countries will have to rely
increasingly on "soft" or "co-optive" power: getting other
countries not so much to do things they don't want, but
rather, actually to want the same things we do. In recent
years, he contends, military and covert action, and even
blatant economic coercion, have been rendered less usable for
all powers by such forces as the nuclear threat, economic
interdependence, technology's diffusion, and the extension of
democratic forms and ideals.
   In many ways, the U.S. is uniquely well-situated for this
new world. Unlike Japan, we have a pluralistic society that
readily absorbs immigrants, products, new ideas. Unlike the
Soviets, we have a basically healthy polity, economy and
ideology that are envied, not loathed, by most of the world.
   Mr. Nye's concluding discussion of options for U.S. policy
seems, by contrast, flat and conventional. He seems reluctant
to consider dismantling U.S. forces in Europe, though this
would save about $100 billion a year in an age of resource
pressures. Nor do the final chapters have much to say about
rebuilding Eastern Europe economically, or the fragile
democracies of the Third World. Here we are, with several
billion people balanced on the margin between freedom and
slavery -- and Mr. Nye seems more focused on "drug traffic,
AIDS, global warming and other problems."
   Indeed, while pleading for "long-run thinking," "Bound to
Lead" provides little in the way of a central, animating
vision as to how all this U.S. influence ought to be used. If
leaders are to execute the consistent diplomacy whose absence
Mr. Nye and other intellectuals bemoan, and if voters are to
support it, then intellectuals must do a better job
propounding principles and standards.
   Mr. Nye makes up for his weak summation, however, with his
well-documented central message: If power is considered in
its broad, ideopolitical manifestations, the U.S. enters the
1990s as the world's greatest single player. No, we can't
absolutely determine that, say, Poland or Brazil will emerge
as stable democracies. But we will have much to say about it.
In alerting us to this awesome responsibility, "Bound to
Lead" may help us to discharge it efficaciously.
