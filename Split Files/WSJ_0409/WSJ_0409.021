Nashville, Tenn., to LBI Holdings Inc., Los Angeles, for

   Jacor said it will have a gain of about $13.3 million on
the LBI Holdings transaction and an $8 million gain on the
sale to Capstar. Jacor said it will use the proceeds from the
sales to further its plans to buy "more valuable stations in
much larger radio markets."
   LBI Holdings was recently formed by Carl E. Hirsch and
Robert F.X. Sillerman, formerly partners in Legacy
Broadcasting, Jacor said. Mr. Hirsch also is a former
president of Malrite Communication Group, a Cleveland-based
broadcasting concern.
   Capstar already owns radio stations in Nashville;
Greenville, S.C., and Jackson, Miss. Jacor owns 13 radio
stations, a cable television system and other communications
businesses.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Jacor shares
jumped 37.5 cents to close at 5.375.
