   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. said it
expects its personal-systems business to gain market share in
1990, with revenue growing by a percentage in the "midteens"
or better.
   The optimistic estimate was made by James Cannavino, IBM's
general manager of personal systems, in an annual background
session for securities analysts here. It was the first time
the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant said what it meant by
previous statements that 1990 was shaping up as a "good"
year.

   Revenue from IBM's personal-systems business, which
includes both personal computers and workstations, grew 18%
in 1989, to $8.24 billion, or 13.1% of IBM's total revenue.
During the same period, the world-wide market grew about 15%.
Mr. Cannavino said IBM expects world-wide growth in 1990 to
be somewhat slower"some place between single digits and
midteens."
   IBM's personal computers, 80% of which are sold through
retail channels, held a 34.7% share of that market in the
U.S. in 1989, according to Audits &amp; Surveys Inc., a
market-research firm. IBM's U.S. market share for
workstations during 1989 was minuscule, only about 2%, but
the company recently unveiled a hot new line called the RISC
System/6000, which should boost that number in 1990. No
reliable figures are available for IBM's world-wide market
share.
   Mr. Cannavino also said IBM has resolved supply problems
that plagued its personal-systems business last year, and is
promptly filling 94% of all orders for computers, up from
33%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, IBM
closed at $105.875 a share, down 25 cents.

   INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES Corp. clarified a growth
estimate it made in yesterday's edition. The company expects
revenue from its Personal System/2 business, not its
personal-systems business, to grow by a percentage in the
midteens or better, a spokesman said. The personal-systems
business includes both PS/2 personal computers and
workstations.
