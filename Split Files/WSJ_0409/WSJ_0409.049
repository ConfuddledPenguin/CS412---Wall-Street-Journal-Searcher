   With the April 16 tax-filing deadline fast approaching,
brokerage houses and mutual funds are inundating investors
with sales pitches for municipal bonds.
   Their message: Start collecting high tax-free yields and
stop paying all that money to the government.

   That can seem awfully tempting, especially for investors
in high-tax states like California and New York. Many
municipal bonds now offer yields equivalent to more than 10%
on taxable investments for people in the 28% bracket. The
taxable-equivalent yield can be even higher when state and
local taxes are taken into account.
   But while municipal bonds have a place in the portfolios
of many investors, bond strategists warn that the $784
billion muni market can be much trickier and riskier than it
looks. And while this could be the time for selective buying,
some say investors who hold back may find even bigger rewards
later.
   The average yield on an index of 20 long-term "general
obligation" bonds, which are backed by the taxing authority
of the states and local governments that issue them, is
currently around 7.3%, according to the Bond Buyer, a trade
publication. That's about 86% of the yield on comparable
Treasury bonds.
   Last November, however, the average yield was around 92%
of the return on Treasurys. Some analysts advise postponing
buying long-term municipals until that percentage rises back
to about 90%. "Long-term municipals generally are not a
bargain right now," says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice
president at Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman.
   The gap between municipal-bond and Treasury yields has
widened since last fall because muni yields haven't risen as
fast as Treasury yields. This reflects a scant supply of
munis at a time of continued heavy Treasury-bond issuance.
But the volume of new municipal bond sales is expected to
pick up soon, which some analysts say will push muni yields
up, narrowing the margin.
   Several analysts are also unenthusiastic about short-term
municipal bonds, those due in a year or less and found in the
portfolios of tax-exempt money-market mutual funds. Yields on
these issues, they say, aren't significantly better than U.S.
Treasury bill yields after taking federal income taxes into
account.
   For example, six-month Treasury bills now pay around 8.2%,
while comparable short-term municipal notes yield about 6%,
according to Neal Attermann, head of municipal-bond research
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. That's equivalent to a Treasury
yield of 8.3% for someone in the 28% bracket, and about 9%
for those in the 33% bracket. Although interest on T-bills is
taxable at the federal level, it's tax-free at the state and
local levels.
   Intermediate-term munis, those due in seven to 15 years,
could be a better choice right now, some analysts say. That's
because intermediate-term bonds now pay nearly the same
returns as long-term bonds, while their prices generally
fluctuate less in the secondary market. For example,
triple-A-rated bonds due in 2005 yield about 7%, while those
due in 2020 yield less than two-tenths of a percentage point
more, according to Municipal Market Data Inc. in Boston. For
an investor with $10,000, that represents a difference of
only $15 a year.
   Many investment strategists also urge investors to stick
with top-quality municipal bonds and shun most low-rated
issues. "The lesson is go for quality," says James S. Tisch,
executive vice president at Loews Corp. "The reason is the
{yield} spreads are so narrow" between top-quality and
lower-quality bonds that investors aren't getting paid for
the added risk.
   For example, a typical triple-A-rated bond due in 20 years
now yields about 7.10%. That is only about half a percentage
point less than some Baa-rated bonds.
   "Individuals should buy only bonds that are rated double-A
or better," says Christine Carter Lynch, a municipal-bond
money manager and managing editor of Lynch Municipal Bond
Advisory, a New York-based monthly newsletter. "The
risk-reward ratio just isn't there" to justify buying
lower-rated issues. She says the "most attractive" municipal
bonds available now are "pre-refunded bonds," backed by U.S.
Treasury securities placed in escrow to pay their principal
and interest.
   Credit quality is likely to become even more important in
coming months. Municipal-finance specialists expect more
state and local governments to encounter budget headaches
because of the economy's continued sluggishness. That could
further depress prices of those bonds trading in the
secondary market. Prices of Massachusetts and New York bonds
already have taken a pounding in recent months because of
those states' fiscal woes.
   Analysts also are leery of many hospital and health-care
bonds. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered ratings for
seven nonprofit hospitals in this year's first quarter, while
upgrading only one. "The trend reflects a continuation of the
deteriorating financial condition of the hospital industry,"
the credit-rating agency said recently.
   Says Peter J.D. Gordon, managing director and head of the
municipal-bond division at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.: "I
certainly would advise investors to stay away from
health-care and nursing-home issues."
   Investors considering municipal bonds should remember that
they have some important drawbacks. Most municipals can be
"called," or redeemed early, and even professional analysts
occasionally are taken by surprise. Bond calls usually are
bad news for investors who think they've locked up attractive
yields until a bond's scheduled maturity. The number of
municipal-bond calls is expected to surge in coming years, as
issuers float new bonds to pay off older, higher-yielding
debt.
   Buying and selling municipals and keeping track of their
prices can also be a problem. There are more than one million
different issues, and most of them don't trade often. As a
result, some municipal-bond specialists recommend buying
pieces of large bond issues, which often are more actively
traded on the secondary markets.
   Harvey Spiro, a Los Angeles investment manager recently
bought some municipal bonds for himself. "If you want
marketability and liquidity," he advises, "stick to large
issues."
