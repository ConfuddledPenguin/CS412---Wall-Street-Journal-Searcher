   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum-industry executives caved in last
November to can buyers' demands for lower prices.
   Except for Paul O'Neill. Ignoring the advice of virtually
every top Alcoa official, the chief executive of Aluminum Co.
of America broke with the industry's lock-step pricing
mentality.

   It was a costly decision. Enraged customers canceled
orders with Alcoa, and so far the No. 1 aluminum maker has
lost perhaps $100 million of sales and several percentage
points of can-market share.
   Exceptional as the move was, it was what the industry has
come to expect from Paul O'Neill. Ever since he became
Alcoa's chief executive three years ago, he has shown a
penchant for unorthodox ideas.
   The rationale in this case is that Mr. O'Neill is
determined to get more stable pricing in the aluminum
industry. "It's nonsensical to lower can-sheet prices every
time the price of raw aluminum ingot {the primary metal}
falls on the world market," he says. "Have you ever tried to
put beer into an ingot?"
   Nevertheless, last week Mr. O'Neill discovered just how
hard it is to be a corporate maverick and resist industry
forces. On Friday, Alcoa's stock took a hit when a securities
analyst, First Boston's Peter Anker, said Alcoa had begun
giving selected price discounts to some major cansheet
buyers. He also lowered his rating on the stock, which closed
down $1.375 at $62 in heavy Big Board trading.
   Asked about the analyst's statement, Mr. O'Neill says he
won't talk about dealings with individual customers, but
contends his pricing strategy is still in place. "We walked
away from a substantial amount of business {in November} that
could have been ours if we had discounted -- and we didn't,"
he insists. "I haven't given up on the logic of that idea."
   Recasting Alcoa has been Mr. O'Neill's mission ever since
discontented directors ousted his predecessor and lured him
from the presidency of International Paper Co. Taking over
the staid, century-old metal company, he scrapped its forays
into high-tech businesses like ceramics and composite
materials to focus solely on aluminum, a strategy contrary to
that of rivals such as Reynolds Metals Co. He has linked
employee pay and shareholder dividends more directly to
profits. And he rejects Wall Street demands for quick
returns.
   "What Paul is after is longer-term results. This is
somebody not building the Alcoa of next month but 10 years
from now," says Judith M. Gueron, an Alcoa director and the
president of Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a
social-services research organization.
   But not all shareholders are that patient. Even though
Alcoa's net income rose 10% last year to a record $945
million, or $10.67 a share, on sales of $10.91 billion, many
holders are angry about its 24% plunge in fourth-quarter
profit. "I got smacked right in the middle of the head --
caught by total surprise," says John Lattanzio, portfolio
manager at Steinhardt Partners, which nevertheless has hung
onto its nearly 5% stake.
   Mr. O'Neill had met with analysts just weeks before but
hadn't warned them -- partly, he says, because "the emphasis
on quarterly results is ridiculous." The result was that the
stock got clobbered when the profit report came out.
   Mr. O'Neill faces even tougher times ahead in trying to
counter traditionally cyclical aluminum profits in a soft
economy. Partly because of his can-sheet pricing moves,
Alcoa's earnings in the first quarter could skid as much as
40% from a year earlier and, for the year, will probably fall
25%, analysts say. (Alcoa's chief rival, Alcan Aluminium
Ltd., is suffering, too; its fourth-quarter net income fell
45%, and analysts predict drops of about 75% in the first
quarter and as much as 70% for all of 1990.)
   The 54-year-old Mr. O'Neill insists that Alcoa can make
good money on aluminum with the right mix of pricing, product
and management strategies. Soon after arriving at Alcoa in
June 1987, he sold off nonaluminum holdings, including a
natural-gas drilling business and most of an
aerospace-materials company acquired by his predecessor,
Charles A. Parry.
   Such divestitures have been backed by directors, who
expect aluminum demand to grow robustly in the 1990s.
Earlier, they had fought Mr. Parry's plans, arguing that
Alcoa should stick to what it knew best. "I don't think he
had his diversification program sorted out very well," says
W.H. Krome George, a director and former Alcoa chairman who
led the revolt against Mr. Parry.
   A lifetime veteran of Alcoa, Mr. Parry won't comment on
his ouster. Associates assert that his diversification plans
contributed to the board's lack of confidence in his
stewardship. They claim that though Mr. Parry was affable and
well-liked by Alcoans, he simply wasn't a leader and had a
blurred vision of where he wanted to take Alcoa.
   In Mr. O'Neill, directors have a chairman whose style is
as distinct as his strategy. The first outsider to run the
aluminum giant -- though he was an Alcoa director at the time
of the boardroom coup -- he broke with tradition from the
start. He did away with the corporate limousine and booked
commercial flights. A nongolfer, he declined to join the
clubs frequented by top Alcoa executives.
   He also didn't bring any trusted aides with him and,
unlike many imported CEOs, didn't fire veteran executives.
Instead of barking out orders, he asked people what he could
do to help them; in fact, some Alcoans, accustomed to gruff
handling, at first thought him a wimp. He encouraged
employees, even hourly workers, to get in touch with him if
they had a problem. (One call from a rank-and-filer in
Warrick County, Ind., led to reassignment of the plant
manager there.)
   Mr. O'Neill came to the corporate suite late in life,
after a career in government, where he had risen to
second-ranking budget official during the Ford
administration. He still confers regularly with President
Bush and says he would like to return to government someday.
   He is a frugal man. At Alcoa, he avoids the executive
dining suite for a quick sandwich at his desk and a 20-minute
walk. Even though his cash compensation last year totaled
$1.3 million, he buys his suits off the rack at Kaufmann's, a
middlebrow Pittsburgh department store, and passes down used
cars to his children rather than buying them new ones.
"Paul's not impressed by the normal things that impress
people," Ms. Gueron says.
   Mr. O'Neill imposes similar frugality on managers,
compelling them to wring better returns out of aluminum.
Touring Alcoa's sprawling power plant at its Rockdale, Texas,
smelter, he noticed water leaking from boiler pipes. Once the
tour ended, he told the plant manager to fix the leak -- and
submit a report on it to him.
   At the same time, Mr. O'Neill has begun creating an
environment in which Alcoa employees think more for
themselves. In Texas, plant workers devised a new system to
reduce power costs by $400,000 a year. In Brazil, employees
suggested a new wooden shipping crate that saved another
$150,000. In Tennessee, an employee-led innovation cut by 40%
the processing time for a coil of aluminum. To help keep
employees pursuing such improvements, half of Alcoa's 61,000
workers world-wide are now covered by some form of variable
compensation tied to corporate profits; that's up from just
5% three years ago.
   Most of the 1989 profit gain reflected reduced debt -- a
reduction partly achieved with proceeds from selling
non-aluminum operations -- and a consequent $100 million cut
in interest expenses since 1986. Interest income, meanwhile,
has skyrocketed some $200 million. The resulting improvement
in the cash position, along with widespread cost cutting, has
brightened the profit picture. Now, Alcoa can earn nearly $6
a share with the primary-aluminum price at only 55 cents a
pound -- triple the 1986 profitability. At present, the price
is 70 cents a pound; last year, it averaged 88 cents.
   Mr. O'Neill predicts that the company will average at
least a 15% return on equity in the future and not less than
10% in any year. That would be a huge jump: Alcoa's rate of
return averaged only 9.7% in the pre-O'Neill decade.
   Any such increase in profitability would directly benefit
Alcoa stockholders. Under a new formula, they are guaranteed
a 40-cent quarterly dividend plus 30% of any profits over $6
a share, a level easily exceeded last year.
   Meanwhile, Mr. O'Neill has encouraged managers to base
more of their decisionmaking on nonfinancial measures. At his
request, Alcoa people gathered tons of data about
productivity, safety, quality -- some 450 nonfinancial
measures in all -- plus similar information about competitors
to give his managers benchmarks.
   The benchmarks were revealing. Executives learned, for
instance, that one Japanese fabricator could roll aluminum
can sheet and reuse 20% more of the leftover scrap than Alcoa
could. They also found that the average smelter at its Texas
plant had to be relined after 1,221 days of use, compared
with 2,700 days at an Alusuisse plant in Switzerland.
   Mr. O'Neill pushes hard in several areas, including:
   -- Finding new uses for aluminum, especially in the
packaging, construction, aircraft and automotive markets. For
example, Alcoa has stepped up efforts to get more aluminum in
cars. The Audi unit of Volkswagen AG will soon unveil plans
for the world's first mass-produced aluminum car, which was
designed in a joint effort with Alcoa and is due out in 1993.
   -- Quality, which means to Mr. O'Neill not simply better
products and fewer complaints from customers but also the way
Alcoa employees approach their jobs. He appointed a team of
35 professionals, led by a vice president of quality, who so
far have indoctrinated 1,800 employees in the "quality
process." The process, taught over 10 days, is a rigorous
system for identifying and correcting lapses.
   -- And workplace safety, an issue seldom mentioned by
CEOs. Whether speaking to securities analysts, senior
management or the rank and file, Mr. O'Neill invariably talks
about safety first. Early on, he said he aims for an
"injury-free workplace." Assuming accidents would occur, the
executive told skeptical managers, was no longer acceptable.
Even union officials were dumbfounded; many said it was
unattainable. But the company has set stringent goals and
already has cut its serious injuries 30% since 1986.
   Safety matters, says Mr. O'Neill, because it tells
employees that they matter. But his relentless emphasis on
the issue has confused some employees. In fact, though many
Alcoans praise Mr. O'Neill, many others say he is puzzling.
Speaking to senior executives at a management retreat in
Florida last October, for instance, he talked for four hours
about "recreating Alcoa." Afterward, the 29 participants were
asked for critiques of the session. Wrote one: "We're still
learning to speak his language."
   Mr. O'Neill never seems to stop speaking to employees.
Last year, he logged some 175,000 miles and spent 137 days
away from headquarters, including 39 days outside the U.S.,
visiting Alcoa facilities.
   At the start of another trip, riding in a Chevy van
through a dark Texas night en route to the plant in Rockdale,
Mr. O'Neill questioned his driver, plant manager Jack Drake,
in a gently prodding manner that accentuated the positive.
   "That's terrific, Jack," he said as Mr. Drake explained
how one office worker's idea helped the plant reduce the
funds held in its local checking account by $50,000.
   During the next day, hourly workers beamed with pride as
they showed off their inventions that have transformed
Rockdale from an also-ran plant that had been targeted for
possible closure some years ago into a profitable performer.
   "If you can't convince people that they're more important
than the volume of products they get out the door, you
haven't got a chance," Mr. O'Neill asserts. "I don't believe
in management by fear. It doesn't make for lasting change,
because as soon as the fear driver goes away, people relax."
   Yet some Alcoa people worry that Mr. O'Neill's benevolent
but demanding style might turn ugly someday. "People are
afraid he'll strip the corporate headquarters staff if
business goes bad," one vice president says. Already, Mr.
O'Neill has transferred nearly 100 senior managers to plants
in rural Tennessee to get them closer to operations. Adds
another manager: "You're never sure Paul's satisfied. He's a
workaholic" -- sometimes arriving at work as early as 4:30
a.m. -- "and very demanding. If business turns down, what
will he be like?"
   Heightening worries was Mr. O'Neill's unilateral pricing
move in November, which critics contend exhibited his
tendency to "micro-manage" -- or meddle. Alcoa veterans
contend that his refusal to follow discounting by Alcan,
Reynolds and Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. cost Alcoa
customers that it will take months, at the least, to woo
back. In the aftermath, they note, Alcoa laid off 100
workers.
   A disgruntled buyer at Pearl Brewing Co., who has reduced
purchases of Alcoa aluminum for the Texas brewery's beer
cans, complains: "Alcoa claims they're selling quality, but
in today's market you don't buy quality. That's expected."
   Mr. O'Neill argues that holding the line on pricing is the
only way to overcome the cyclicality of aluminum profits.
"Just because somebody else hasn't {held prices} before,
doesn't seem to me a good reason not to try," he says. "For
the long run, we've got to insist on better economics" than
the industry has had in the past.
   By refusing to reduce prices last November when the bulk
of can-sheet was ordered for the first half of 1990, Alcoa
lost business, Mr. O'Neill concedes. But, he asserts, the
company has already regained some customers and will win back
even more as the year progresses and can-sheet supplies
tighten.
   "We've had a whole bunch of business come back to us in
the last six weeks," he says. "Before 1990 is over, we could
end up at or even above" the sales levels once projected for
this year. It is in the course of winning back customers that
Alcoa has done some slight discounting after all, industry
insiders say.
   Some 39,000 feet above Kentucky, airborne on a jet
whisking him to his next plant visit, Mr. O'Neill confesses
frustration with the "time it takes to create deep-seated
change" in a corporate giant.
   The market may want quick results, he concedes. What he's
after, though, takes time. "There will be a few bumps along
the way," he says, his feet propped up on the seat facing
him. "But if we succeed in creating lasting change, then the
short-term stuff will take care of itself."
