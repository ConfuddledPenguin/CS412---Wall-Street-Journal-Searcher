   WASHINGTON -- The latest employment statistics cast some
doubt on the growing sentiment that the economy's weakest
point is past.
   Although the Labor Department's monthly survey of
households found that the nation's civilian unemployment rate
declined slightly in March, the department's closely watched
survey of businesses found that employers' payrolls grew by
only 26,000 during the month, a tiny gain by economists'
standards. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.2% of the
civilian work force, from 5.3% in February.

   The meager job growth -- which came despite the hiring of
some 85,000 Census workers during the month -- disappointed
many economists. "This shows widespread weakness," said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Services
Group in Providence, R.I. "I'm at a loss to explain the March
weakness without making reference to the fact that the
economy may be a little weaker than the consensus thinks."
   But concern over the numbers was tempered by strong
employment gains in the first two months of the year, when
unseasonably warm weather brought on a spurt of hiring in the
construction business, for example. In both January and
February, employers hired more than 300,000 new workers.
   Paul Anton, president of Anton Financial Economics, a
consulting company in Minneapolis, said the figures don't
cause great concern "because we had such strong numbers in
the past two months. But I certainly would be concerned if we
had another month at this level."
   One of the most disturbing figures in the report was a
30,000 drop in manufacturing jobs. Over the past year, the
report said, the U.S. has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said the decline in manufacturing
employment wasn't confined to certain industries. "It's all
over," he said. "It's widespread weakness. That's what's
surprising." He cited recent reports from the Federal Reserve
and the National Association of Purchasing Managers that
"seemed to suggest manufacturing was stabilizing."
   After severely slowing in the fourth quarter, the economy
has seemed to rebound a bit in the first quarter of 1990,
buoyed partly by warm weather.
   But Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said, "I still believe, based
on these and the last couple of months' numbers on employment
that we will be settling down in the second quarter to much
lower employment growth and lower economic growth."
   Another industry that appears to be weakening is retail
trade, analysts said. Retail employment declined in March for
the second month in a row following a large increase in
January. "These up and down movements make it somewhat
difficult to detect underlying trends, but net job growth for
this industry in recent months is clearly much slower than in
1989," said Janet Norwood, the Labor Department's
commissioner of labor statistics, in congressional testimony
Friday.
   The service industries continued to offset weakness in
other areas of the economy as they have for several months.
Overall, service-producing jobs grew by 122,000 in March, the
department said.
