   Weyerhaeuser Co., Seattle, and Portland General Corp. said
they plan to sell Cornerstone Columbia Development Co., a
commercial development and hotel management concern they have
jointly owned since 1985. A price wasn't disclosed.
   Portland General said its decision to sell follows a plan
announced earlier to get out of the real estate business and
concentrate on the energy business. Weyerhaeuser said
Cornerstone's activities overlap building and development
activities of its unit, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co.

   The companies said they may retain a minor interest. They
said Seattle-based Cornerstone will continue to develop real
estate in the Northwest and is expected to develop projects
valued at more than $100 million this year.
