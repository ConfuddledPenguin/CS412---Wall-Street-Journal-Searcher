   SEBOKENG, South Africa -- Not even Nelson Mandela can be
in two places at the same time.
   As a black South African, Mr. Mandela wanted to be here
yesterday, one of 20,000 burying the latest group of black
martyrs killed by the South African police. But as the deputy
president of the African National Congress, he found himself
on a plane heading to Lusaka, Zambia, to brief the
organization's exile leadership on his recent talks with the
South African government. His body was there, but his heart
was here. After 27 years in prison, he wants to follow his
people, to be part of them. But he knows he must also lead.

   Such is the dilemma of Mr. Mandela as he walks the thin
line between talks with the government and solidarity with
his people. While trying to unify the country's black
majority, which has been systematically divided by the white
government over the decades, Mr. Mandela is battling to catch
up and move forward at the same time. Wherever he goes in the
country, he finds himself having to balance black emotions
over the past with black aspirations for the future.
   Sebokeng, a vast gathering of shacks south of Johannesburg
that has often been a flashpoint of conflict and a target of
repression, provided his first true test, when, on March 26,
police opened fire on residents marching to protest high
rents and poor living conditions. Several blacks were killed
immediately (the death toll is now 17, according to community
leaders) and hundreds were injured. The ANC leadership
expressed outrage at the shootings, but initially said the
tragedy shouldn't derail the opening of ANC-government talks
set for April 11. But when Mr. Mandela and other leaders
visited the injured and the families of the dead, there was
no mistaking the community's anger at the police and
government. Mr. Mandela and the ANC announced a suspension of
the talks.
   Although the decision seemed to highlight divisions within
the ANC -- between Mr. Mandela and others anxious to begin
power-sharing talks with the government and hard-liners
opposed to negotiations -- and subjected the ANC to much
international criticism, Mr. Mandela and his colleagues
really had no choice.
   "For the ANC leaders to go on talking with the government
while ANC members are being killed by the police would have
given a very negative impression to our people," says Michael
Mile, a young ANC supporter who has come to mourn his fallen
friends. "To talk while the killing goes on would have shown
no unity at all."
   While the suspension of talks may have left the ANC
looking in disarray, the Sebokeng shootings actually served
to crystallize both the organization's strategy and Mr.
Mandela's stature in the black community. The ANC is now
telling other black groups and leaders inside the country
that the time has come to choose between it and the
government, between those who were shot and those who did the
shooting.
   "There is no longer room for anyone to be neutral," ANC
leader Walter Sisulu said at yesterday's funeral. "Either you
are with the regime or you are with us."
   After pulling out of this week's scheduled talks with
Pretoria, Mr. Mandela began working to isolate the
government. He spoke with the leaders of six black homelands
who were to meet with the government last week, and four of
them agreed to back out of their talks. Also, the ANC has
persuaded a host of black town councilors around the country
to resign, or pledge to work for the end of the municipal
government structures. The government, which accuses the ANC
of intimidation tactics, had been fervently hoping that the
homeland leaders and black councilors -- its allies in
administering the country's segregated political structure --
would be on its side in future power-sharing negotiations.
   Following these moves, Mr. Mandela met with President F.W.
de Klerk for three hours late last week and agreed to
reschedule the ANC-government talks for May 2-4. He also
pressed Mr. de Klerk into opening a judicial inquiry into why
the police opened fire in Sebokeng.
   "We see that Mandela did raise the grievances of the
people," says Benjamin Hlanyane, one of yesterday's mourners.
"The people now understand that the ANC does represent them."
   Still, the ANC has its opponents. Its bitter differences
with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the KwaZulu
homeland, have widened in recent weeks as the fighting
between his supporters and ANC sympathizers in Natal Province
intensifies. And the Pan African Congress, which advocates a
black takeover of power and is opposed to negotiations with
the government, accuses the ANC of selling out blacks. On
Saturday, Mr. Mandela met with supporters of the PAC, and the
two groups issued a joint statement saying, "Unity in action
and peace among our people require urgent resolution."
   But in burying its dead yesterday, the ANC resurrected its
dream of black unity. "There are only two roads to take, the
government or the people," shouted Mr. Sisulu. "It is time to
stand united . . . to follow the road traveled by the people
we bury today."
