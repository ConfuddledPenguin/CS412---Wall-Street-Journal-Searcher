   PITTSBURGH -- Add ketchup bottles to the growing list of
environmentally friendly containers.
   H.J. Heinz Co., the world's largest ketchup maker, said it
will introduce a recyclable plastic ketchup bottle next year.
Although the package material, called polyethylene
terephthalate, or PET, has been used for soft-drink bottles
since the 1970s, the food company spent three years and $8
million developing the material for its own bottles. It
worked on the project with Continental PET Technologies, a
division of Continental Can Co. that also makes PET
containers for soft drinks.

   The move is the latest response to increased concerns over
environmental problems created by nonrecyclable plastics.
Last month, Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it
would begin to sell some of its detergents and cleaners in
bottles made from recycled plastic.
   Heinz said the recyclable package will replace its opaque,
squeezable plastic container, which was introduced in 1983
and accounts for 60% of the 190 million ketchup bottles Heinz
sells in the U.S. each year. The rest are glass. The new
recyclable package also is squeezable but is clear like a
glass jar, which the company believes consumers will prefer.
   The new container "meets consumer demands on two levels:
the recycling issue as well as the functionality of the
package," said Brian Ruder, vice president of the
consumer-products division for Heinz U.S.A.
   Heinz said that the change will require some retooling of
its factories but that the new package will not increase
ketchup prices.
   Consumers will be asked to put the recyclable ketchup
container in a bag for curb-side pick-up. But only homes that
are in a region served by special reclamation facilities,
where the containers are recycled into consumer goods, can
participate. There are currently about 30 such facilities,
but Heinz says that number will increase as the special
containers become more widespread.
