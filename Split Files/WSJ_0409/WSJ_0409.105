   NEW YORK -- Interest rates are likely to remain relatively
stable in the weeks ahead while the Federal Reserve keeps
credit policy on hold, many economists believe.
   The first quarter's spike in long-term interest rates has
leveled off for now, they say, leaving rates likely to
fluctuate in narrow ranges.

   "The financial markets will be treading water," said
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. "I
don't see much likelihood of rates rising over the next few
months -- nor the likelihood of a significant drop."
   Even without a major rate move, traders still expect rates
to be yanked around from day to day by rumors and events in
Japan and Europe. In Mr. Robertson's view, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond could vacillate between 8
3/4% and 8 1/4%.
   He and other economists base their forecasts largely on
the Labor Department's March employment data released Friday.
Bond market players view the jobs data as the most important
of the government's monthly indicators because they are
timely and sometimes help determine the Federal Reserve's
next move on interest rates.
   Reports on such topics as foreign trade and orders for
big-ticket merchandise are released more than a month after
the reporting period ends. But the jobs data emerge the first
Friday of every month, for the prior month. Last spring and
summer when the Fed was slowly pushing interest rates lower,
its moves often occurred shortly after the employment data
were released.
   Friday's report was considered especially crucial because
it was supposed to show if the big employment gains of
332,000 in January and 356,000 in February were aberrations
or a harbinger of strong economic growth. The latter
possibility worried bondholders. They feared it could lead to
higher inflation, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates.
Both trends would hurt bond prices.
   But Friday's employment report didn't clarify things. The
number of non-farm jobs expanded by just 26,000 last month,
the smallest advance in nearly four years, suggesting that
the economy isn't gathering strength. Yet the unemployment
rate eased to 5.2% in March from 5.3% in February, meaning
that the economy isn't sitting still, either.
   "You can't make a strong argument one way or the other
because the employment data was a real mixed bag," said Louis
Crandall, economist at W.R. Wrightson &amp; Co.
   With no clear trend apparent, economist Maria Fiorini
Ramirez believes "there is no reason for the Fed to change
policy," and the closely watched federal funds rate will stay
at its current level of 8 1/4%. Federal funds, which the Fed
uses to signal changes in credit policy, is the rate that
banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   Ms. Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said the economy is growing at a relatively
healthy pace but growth is "neither decelerating nor
re-accelerating."
   In the coming weeks, the bond market is likely to take its
cues from developments in the foreign-exchange market and the
Japanese financial markets. The biggest worry is that the
steep decline in the Tokyo stock market, which has dropped
nearly 30% so far this year, could continue and put pressure
on Japanese investors to sell U.S. Treasury bonds to raise
cash.
   "People are very afraid of a Japanese liquidation of
Treasury bonds," said Jay Goldinger, a trader and investment
strategist at Capital Insight, Beverly Hills, Calif.
"Everybody is somewhat fearful that Treasury bonds will go
down like gold," he said. Mr. Goldinger was referring to the
March 26 sell-off that resulted in gold prices plunging $20
an ounce in one day. The gold rout was triggered by reports
that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority sold two million
ounces of gold in London. "If it can happen in gold, there is
a fear that it can happen in bonds."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices ended little changed after a roller
coaster ride that was sparked by a smaller-than-expected gain
in March payrolls and other reports.
   "Trading was really kind of schizophrenic," said Charles
Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover
Securities Corp. Bond prices initially rose as much as 3/4
point, or $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, in
reaction to the small rise in employment growth. But soon
after the early buying spree the market abruptly switched
gears, with bond prices giving up their gain and heading down
as much as 3/8 point before edging back up to finish little
changed.
   Among the rumors whipping the market Friday was talk that
a large Japanese institution had sold $1 billion of 30-year
bonds. The market was also disturbed by news that an official
of West Germany's central bank had said interest rates would
have to rise again if the two Germanys decided on a
one-to-one exchange rate for their two currencies.
   Bond prices were further hurt by a wire service's report,
which cited an unnamed Federal Reserve official as saying the
lower civilian unemployment rate was raising concern about
inflation. The March unemployment rate dipped to 5.2% from
5.3% in February.
   By the end of trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was
unchanged from Thursday at a price of 99 23/32 to yield
8.51%. The latest 10-year notes were at 99 19/32 to yield
8.54% compared with 99 17/32 to yield 8.55%. Short-term rates
were little changed.
   The government will auction $3.5 billion of 40-year bonds
for the Resolution Funding Corp. tomorrow and will sell $7.5
billion of seven-year notes Wednesday. In when-issued trading
Friday, the 40-year Refcorp bonds were yielding 8.83% and the
seven-year notes 8.59%.
   In the corporate market, a $500 million offering by
PepsiCo Inc. capped a heavy week of offerings that saw more
than $3 billion of new debt sold.
   Junk bonds of Eckerd Holdings plummeted more than seven
points on rumors that Jack Eckerd Corp. plans to acquire some
Revco D.S. Inc. assets. By comparison, most other junk bonds
or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or none at
all lost 1/4 to 3/8 point while high-grade bonds were little
changed.
   Eckerd officials couldn't be reached to comment on the
rumors, which also included speculation that the company is
in the private market with a bond issue that will be senior
to its securities outstanding. Eckerd Holdings' 11 1/8%
subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, fell six points to
74.
   The company's zero-coupon securities ended at 65, down 7
1/2 points from Thursday's closing price. A spokeswoman for
Anac Holding Corp., the parent of Revco, confirmed that the
company has been talking with potential buyers for the
purchase of 712 drugstores. The spokeswoman declined to say
whether the company was in discussions with Jack Eckerd Corp.
