   Silverstone Partners, a closely held Los Angeles
partnership, said it is willing to proceed with an offer for
Lincoln N.C. Realty Fund Inc., if Lincoln's board waives
poison pill provisions.
   As previously reported, Lincoln, of Palo Alto, Calif.,
last month said a letter of agreement to be acquired by
Silverstone was terminated because Lincoln's investment
banker couldn't confirm the financial fairness of the deal.
Lincoln had signed a letter of intent to be acquired by
Silverstone for $9.54 a share and 3.1 cents a warrant in a
deal valued at about $19 million. Silverstone holds 8.6% of
Lincoln.
