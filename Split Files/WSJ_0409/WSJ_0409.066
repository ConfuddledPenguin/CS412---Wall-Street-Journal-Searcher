   Circon Corp., Santa Barbara, Calif., said it refinanced
much of its debt, buying back a $9 million convertible
debenture at a discount and revising bank borrowings.
   The maker of miniature television cameras for medical uses
said it expects to report a $700,000 after-tax gain on the
debenture repurchase. In 1989, the company had net income of
$302,000, or six cents a share, on $49.6 million in sales.

   Circon said it bought the debenture for $7.5 million from
the holder, a unit of British-based BOC Group PLC. The
debenture was convertible into one million common shares, or
about 16% of Circon's stock outstanding.
   BOC Group said more than a year ago that it was interested
in selling the debenture.
   Circon said it arranged a new $6 million, five-year bank
term loan in connection with the purchase, and a $10 million
two-year line of credit, supplanting an earlier $8.25 million
line of credit.
   The refinancing overall has reduced current company debt
by $966,000. However, annual interest costs will increase by
about $40,000 this year due to higher interest rates on the
new bank debt, said R. Bruce Thompson, executive vice
president and chief financial officer.
