   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it received
an expanded contract to build a $170.2 million
waste-to-energy plant at Auburn Hills, Mich.
   A year ago, Westinghouse received a $123.3 million
contract from Oakland County to build and operate the plant.
However, the new contract calls for a plant that will burn
2,000 tons of municipal solid waste each day, up from the
1,500-ton capacity originally envisioned.

   The county is negotiating with Detroit Edison Co. on an
agreement under which the utility would buy the 62,000
kilowatts of electric power the plant would generate,
Westinghouse said.
