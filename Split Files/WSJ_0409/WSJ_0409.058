   LOS ANGELES -- Carolco Pictures Inc. reported a 57% drop
in fourth-quarter earnings, as revenue from feature films
declined and operating costs soared.
   The Los Angeles entertainment concern posted net income of
$8.2 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $18.7 million,
or 63 cents a share, a year earlier, when box office receipts
from "Rambo III" boosted the bottom line. Revenue fell 1% to
$54.5 million from $54.9 million.

   Feature-film revenue fell 10% to $41.5 million from $46.2
million. That decline was partly offset by higher revenue
from television syndication and other operations. Operating
costs nearly trebled in the latest quarter, to $7.1 million
from $2.5 million a year earlier.
   Also pushing earnings lower was a 69% plunge, to $2.2
million from $6.9 million, in contributions from Carolco's
48% stake in Live Entertainment Inc., a distributor of video
and music products. The drop at Live reflected higher
amortization of accounting goodwill and an increased taxrate.
   For the year, Carolco net fell 61% to $14 million, or 46
cents a share, from $35.5 million, or $1.15 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue dropped 13% to $143.1 million from $164.6
million.
