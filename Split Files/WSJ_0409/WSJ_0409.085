   Another surge of layoffs has begun, reflecting the effects
of the junk bond market's slide and retailers' troubles, as
well as further corporate retrenchments.
   The fresh wave of cutbacks, which follows a flood earlier
this year, is hitting all sectors of the economy and leaving
companies and employees with fewer options. According to data
compiled by Cleveland-based consultant Dan Lacey, staff
reductions totaling 110,152 were announced in the first
quarter, nearly as many as the 111,285 he counted for all of
1989.

   In recent days, underscoring the troubles in the
financial-services and retail sectors, Bank of New England
said it plans to slash its staff by one-third, and most of
Bonwit Teller's chain of retail stores were ordered closed by
a bankruptcy judge, a move that will affect more than 1,000
jobs. The broad-based nature of the cutbacks was evinced by
Baxter International Inc.'s disclosure that it plans to trim
10% of its 64,300 employees.
   Economists said that the dismissals are more severe east
of the Mississippi, especially in the Northeast and the
Mid-Atlantic regions where the economy is softest. In Boston,
for example, three industries are suffering at once: health
care, high technology and finance. As a result, said
compensation consultant John Kieley, "the chance of
employment on the outside isn't what it was" for displaced
managers.
   Nationally, the layoff rate in March was unchanged from
February's 0.424% of the labor force, reported economist
Geoffrey H. Moore, who compiles the figure. But the March
level, above the year-earlier 0.372%, was the highest in
three years.
   Despite all the personnel cutbacks, there has been a "near
balancing" with overall hiring, says Stuart Hoffman, chief
economist at PNC Financial Corp., noting that the nation's
civilian jobless rate remains relatively stable. It edged
lower last month to 5.2% from February's 5.3% rate but is
slightly above the 5% level of a year ago. But the Labor
Department's survey of businesses found that employers'
payrolls grew by a meager 26,000 during the month,
disappointing many economists.
   Mr. Hoffman noted, too, that those laid off aren't
necessarily those being hired. Job losers among civilian
employees rose to 3.4 million last month from the
year-earlier 3.2 million, with the biggest losses coming in
the manufacturing, construction, business and health-care
services and the retail sectors.
   Some job losers are having an easier time getting rehired
than others. Ford Harding, a Millburn, N.J., labor market
analyst, says clerical workers are in great demand and aren't
having trouble finding work. A recruiter told Mr. Harding
recently that he was "very pleased" with the clerical people
he's picked up since Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
bankruptcy-law filing.
   But many dismissed professionals and people with
specialized skills are facing career changes. "There's no
question that workers in this country are going to have to
adapt to career changes more frequently than they have in the
past," said Mr. Harding. Among other things, he cited Wall
Street "gossip" that suggests most of Drexel's professional
employees "will have to find another way to make a living."
   For many analysts, this year's stream of staff trimmings
chiefly represents the second stage of corporate
belt-tightening that began in the mid-1980s. This time,
however, the retrenchment is "cutting into the bone," argued
Robert Brudno, an executive headhunter in Washington, D.C. He
points to a rise in the number of senior managers out of work
and believes such dismissals may leave companies "not only
lean and mean, but hobbled."
   Reflecting the softness for senior-level jobs,
corporations' recruiting of senior executives fell 3% in the
first quarter from a year earlier, according to the quarterly
survey by Korn-Ferry International, the Los Angeles
recruiting company.
   A copycat mentality also has appeared as companies see
downsizing steps competitors are taking and follow suit.
"They're saying: `This is the perfect time to do it. The guy
down the street is doing it, and the guy up the street did
it. We won't look so bad,'" said Mr. Kieley, the compensation
consultant.
   What is clear is that the number of companies that retain
"no layoff" policies has shrunk sharply. Mr. Lacey, the
Cleveland consultant, cites broad cuts announced recently at
usually paternalistic employers, such as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
Eastman Kodak Co. "Companies that have sworn they never get
rid of people are getting rid of people," he said.
   A Boston University study suggests that only 13 companies
with more than 1,000 employees still have no-layoff policies,
including Delta Air Lines, Federal Express Corp., and S.C.
Johnson Co.
   Old rules about cutbacks also appear to be changing. In
the past, companies would pare back in the third quarter,
before year-end balance sheets were computed and prior to
Christmas, when it was deemed cruel to fire someone. But last
year, suggests Mr. Lacey's data, the number of permanent
staff cuts accelerated as the year went on, reaching a peak
of 67,140 in the last quarter, nearly three times as many as
in the previous quarter. The trend has continued into 1990.
   Mr. Kieley said many companies are forgoing offering
early-retirement windows to reduce their staffs because they
fear their best employees will take the offers. Instead, many
are reverting to straight firings to shrink their staffs.
   While some companies are offering generous severance
payments and benefits, others are doing less. Ilene Leff, a
management consultant in Manhattan, walked into a Drexel
office recently to see a banner that said, "Severance pay,
when and if it is paid, will be sent to your home." A
spokesman for Drexel said it is true that, for the roughly
4,500 employees who have been laid off since its
bankruptcy-protection filing, it's an open question whether
severance will be paid.
   At Baxter International, officials still are working to
identify which employees will be offered involuntary early
retirement packages as opposed to regular severance benefits.
The Morton Grove, Ill., hospital-supplies giant doesn't
anticipate any additional cuts beyond the 10% trimming
announced last week.
   Still, said Tony Rucci, senior vice president for human
resources at Baxter, people working in major corporations
must be "realistic enough to assume that the prospect" of
losing their jobs is greater today than ever.
