   Defense contractors are set to post relatively strong
earnings for the first quarter, having taken steps to ward
off one of their biggest balance-sheet demons: the
fixed-price development contract.
   Still, the industry isn't exactly breathing a sigh of
relief. It knows the worst is yet to come. "The fixed-price
contracts have been devastating," says Lior Bregman, of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "But the effect of peace breaking out
hasn't even taken much of a toll yet."

   Indeed, with cutbacks in the defense budget imminent, some
major military contractors "won't have the cash flows to
survive this thing" over the long haul, predicts James
Cunnane, chief financial officer of St. Louis-based General
Dynamics Corp., which builds tanks, submarines and airplanes.
   But in the meantime, weapons manufacturers are sure to
revel in any positive numbers they can squeeze out, thankful
at least that the scourge of fixed-price work is in large
part behind them.
   Under fixed-price accords with the government, companies
must pay for all costs that exceed a predetermined ceiling.
On large-scale development work, which invariably involves
expensive engineering changes along the way, such a formula
almost always triggers heavy losses. In 1989, more than $2
billion in write-downs were logged collectively by the
biggest defense companies because of these agreements. On top
of that, five of the largest aerospace companies were
compelled to put up huge sums as part of a cost-sharing
arrangement in their bid for the Air Force's next-generation
jet, the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   "The environment over the last couple of years has
produced a large financial commitment on the part of industry
-- one it no longer can afford," Mr. Cunnane says.
   But for the short-term anyway, things may be brighter.
Many companies, while vowing not to sign any more rigidly
termed research contracts, went a long way last year toward
accounting for their cost overruns on such work.
   "There is always a risk, some unknown out there," says
John Campbell, senior vice president, finance, at Northrop
Corp., which in both 1988 and 1989 made provisions of $150
million for expected losses on certain classified long-term
fixed-price pacts. "But, obviously, we've worked down the
exposure we had. The risk going forward has to be much less."
   Lockheed Corp., whose $490 million in write-downs on five
fixed-price projects became a point of attack for Dallas
investor Harold Simmons in his recent proxy contest against
the company, also is promising that 1990 will be a better
year. Beginning with the first quarter, the Calabasas,
Calif., concern will turn in "a solid financial performance,"
says Chairman Daniel Tellep. "We expect a big pickup over
all."
   In fact, given the pressure applied by Mr. Simmons,
Lockheed is sure to go out of its way to keep its books
clean. For instance, though waging the proxy fight cost the
company some $8 million before taxes -- roughly a
10-cent-a-share hit to net income, all other things being
equal -- Lockheed isn't expected to break out those
expenditures as a special item. (It's believed that about
half the proxy expenses will be recorded in the first
quarter, and half in the second.)
   Lawrence Harris, who follows Lockheed for Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles brokerage firm, also thinks
an AFP-731 spy satellite that broke up in orbit last month
could require the company to refigure its profit rate on the
program. But indications are that, at least for the first
quarter, Lockheed won't be making any such adjustment. The
company, as is its policy on classified matters, won't even
comment on whether it assembled the satellite in the first
place.
   Others are bound to rack up impressive increases in
profits. Mr. Bregman says defense electronics companies, in
particular, tend to be better managed than some of the big
airframe makers, and he is anticipating double-digit earnings
gains at both Loral Corp. and E-Systems Inc. He is also
looking for some improvement at Martin Marietta Corp. and
Raytheon Co.
   Yet not every company has laid to rest its earnings
difficulties. General Dynamics, for instance, is expected by
Wall Street to report that its operating profit dropped
slightly. Rockwell International Corp.'s earnings, hurt by a
weak auto market, also could be down slightly.
