   NEW YORK -- Two Connecticut thrift holding companies,
Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp., ended
their agreement to merge, citing "the deterioration of the
region's economy and the uncertainties of the regulatory
environment."
   In the merger, each share of Eagle Financial, which is
based in Bristol, Conn., was to be converted into 0.95 share
of the new holding company. Each share of Webster, based in
Waterbury, Conn., was to become one share of the new firm.

   The companies announced the pact in October and
definitively agreed on it two months later. The banks
emphasized that each has capital exceeding regulatory
requirements, but they said the merger wouldn't be in the
best interests of the companies or their shareholders right
now.
   With assets of $708.5 million at Dec. 31, Webster is the
parent of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Waterbury. Eagle,
with assets of $472.3 million on that date, holds Bristol
Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Torrington.
