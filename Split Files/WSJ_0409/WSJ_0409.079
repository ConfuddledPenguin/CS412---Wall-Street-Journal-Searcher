   Airport noise is under increasing fire around the U.S.,
but angry critics won't quiet down until even more is done.
   "It's sort of like smoking," says Dale McDaniel, deputy
associate administrator for policy at the Federal Aviation
Administration. "People's tolerance keeps going down."

   So airports are imposing a raft of new operating rules
that airlines worry will disrupt schedules and service -- and
simply divert the noisier planes to other airports. Some of
the suggested solutions may mean big problems for airlines
with large numbers of older, noisier jets, but carriers with
lots of newer, quieter planes may be better off.
   The airports, especially those that have had recent
air-traffic surges, are staving off citizens' revolts with
noise "budgets," nighttime curfews and fines -- much to the
dismay of airline officials.
   Complying with rules causes headaches for airline
schedulers, who must match aircraft to particular airports'
restrictions. Airlines often send a single aircraft on a
national itinerary. "One restriction can affect the schedules
for 20 flights," says Mr. McDaniel. But local officials
hailed the new noise rules as innovative.
   Just last week, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
approved a plan to sharply cut noise by the year 2001. The
decision followed a voluntary mediation process attended by
pilots, airlines, community groups, the FAA and the Port of
Seattle. The plan calls for creating a steadily shrinking
noise "budget" that would cap the noise, allocate it among
various carriers and reduce it over time. The goal is to
compel carriers to switch to the quieter planes known as
Stage 3 aircraft for most of their flights by 2001.
   Other airports also are moving to scale down noise. In
North Carolina, Raleigh-Durham International Airport, which
saw its traffic soar when American Airlines established a hub
there in 1987, now wants to bring its noise down to the
pre-1987 level. It is also considering a noise "budget" that
would force the use of quieter planes. A Boeing 727, for
example, is an older Stage 2 plane while a Boeing 757 is a
Stage 3 aircraft.
   Several airports, including Boston Logan International
Airport and San Francisco International Airport, have already
imposed tough anti-noise requirements. In California, Orange
County's John Wayne International Airport may have the most
stringent standards in the country. The practical impact of
its rules is that only Stage 3 aircraft can fly there. The
airport goes even further, limiting the number of flights of
even the noisier kinds of Stage 3 planes.
   The noise hubbub is occurring despite statistics
suggesting the problem should be quieting down. The number of
people subjected to what the FAA defines as "unacceptable"
noise levels has decreased to 3.2 million from seven million
in the early 1970s, and is expected to decline to one million
by 2010. That reflects the industry's gradual shift to
quieter aircraft.
   But anti-noise activists scoff at the numbers, saying they
are imprecise. "People don't go to the FAA to find out
whether they have a noise problem," says Tom Duffy, executive
director of the National Organization to Insure a
Sound-Controlled Environment (N.O.I.S.E.). "They say, `I
don't like these planes this loud near my house.' There are
lots more planes than there used to be, and that's why people
are sensitive."
   That sensitivity carries big cost implications for
airlines. Today, about 55% of the planes used in
commercial-airline service in the U.S. are the older, noisier
planes categorized as Stage 2. The rest are the newer,
quieter Stage 3 planes.
   Some groups, including airport operators -- who are
legally liable for damages caused by noise -- are pushing for
a government-ordered early phase-out of Stage 2 planes by the
year 2000. Replacing Stage 2 planes with Stage 3 aircraft
will cost U.S. carriers as much as $90 billion, industry
analysts say. Setting the year 2000 as a deadline would add
as much as $2.5 billion to the cost, according to the FAA.
   Such an early-retirement rule would be tough on the
financially weaker carriers, such as Eastern Air Lines, Pan
American World Airways and Trans World Airlines, which have
lots of noisy planes and not much financial wherewithal to
replace them. Cargo carriers, which have largely Stage 2
fleets, could be hurt, too.
   Because of the cost involved, airlines want something in
return for an accelerated phase-out of older planes: a
national moratorium on new airport-noise restrictions -- in
effect a federal pre-emption of the airports' authority to
set new rules. "The airline industry doesn't object to a
phase-out of Stage 2 if it's reasonable and achievable," says
Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
the airlines' trade association. "But there has to be
protection of the Stage 3 fleet."
   Critics say setting a national noise standard would be a
big mistake. "The notion that you have to come up with a
national noise policy to address situations at San Diego,
Washington Dulles or Denver is ludicrous," says Eliot Cutler,
a Washington-based attorney who represents a number of
communities on noise issues.
   Uncle Sam, for his part, is sending out mixed signals on
the issue. The Bush administration's national transportation
policy, released in February, included only sketchy language
on airport noise. Recently, though, James Busey, the FAA
administrator, warned the sprouting of noise rules could hurt
interstate commerce.
   Such rules sometimes pit airport against airport. Some
residents around National Airport, adjacent to downtown
Washington, want the airport's nighttime noise curfew
tightened. But some Loudoun County, Va., residents object,
saying the noisier planes would wind up at Washington Dulles
International Airport, 34 miles west of National. "We'd get
the leftovers," complains Ann Kavanagh, a member of the
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, whose district includes
Dulles.
   In other cities, plans to build new airports or expand old
ones are under attack because of noise concerns.
   In Texas, a range war is erupting over plans to add two
runways to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, which in
coming years is projected to become the busiest airport in
the country. "We feel that our lives and our privacy are
being invaded," complains Shirley Page, a retired teacher who
lives in the city of Grapevine, which is next to the airport.
   Residents of Tempe, Ariz., are fighting plans to add a
reliever runway to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
And some Bridgeton, Mo., residents are so mad about the
proposed expansion of city-owned Lambert-St.Louis
International Airport that they have founded a group called
Bridgeton Air Defense (BAD) that provides a telephone
joke-of-the-day about St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoemehl. But
officials at all three airports say their expansions are
crucial to handle expected airtraffic surges in coming years.
   Finding an accommodation between the need for additional
airport room and local homeowners' yearnings for peace and
quiet is vital, experts say. "If we don't get a handle on
noise," warns Allen Li of Congress's General Accounting
Office, "we'll never be able to keep pace with growth in the
transportation system."

   USAIR GROUP Inc.'s fleet includes 193 aircraft classified
as the quieter Stage 3 jets, or 43.8% of the airline's total.
In yesterday's edition, a chart provided by Avmark Inc.
incorrectly placed USAir's Stage 3 share at 175 planes and
39.4% of its fleet.
