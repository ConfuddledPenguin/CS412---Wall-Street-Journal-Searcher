   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The Malaysian government said it
will amend its Copyright Act to comply with the Berne
Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works.
   News reports published here last week had stated that
Malaysia, along with 16 other countries, had been placed on a
"watch list" by the U.S. for not providing adequate
protection of intellectual property rights.
