   NEW YORK -- The dollar rocketed higher and Europe's
financial markets reeled as a growing threat of political
instability in the Soviet Union stunned international
investors.
   The U.S. currency gained as international investors sought
safety in the face of probable political turmoil. At one
point, the dollar was up 2.5% on the day against the mark,
and it remained nearly that high late in the New York trading
session. The rush to dollars was triggered by the sudden
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, a
move that called into question the stability of the Soviet
Union.

   European financial markets were shaken by the news. The
German stock market plummeted 3.3%. Prices of German 10-year
government bonds, or bunds, fell nearly 1%. Italian stocks
were off 3%, Norway's market lost 2.8%, and both the French
and Austrian stock markets were down 2.3%. The London stock
market, Europe's largest and most liquid, fared better than
most others. It was off slightly less than 1%.
   U.S. financial markets tended to shrug off the Soviet
Union's problems. Treasury bond prices were off for the day,
but the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.73 points to
close at 2629.46 in active trading.
   Some analysts suggested that the lingering Persian Gulf
crisis is taking a back seat, at least in European investors'
minds, to the Soviet Union's internal problems.
   "The Soviet risk is the real political risk," said Anne
Parker Mills, a currency strategist at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Yesterday's rush to the dollar went a long way toward
restoring the U.S. currency's tarnished reputation as a
haven. The dollar's failure to gain significantly after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait led many analysts to
question that traditional role for the currency. But its
sharp rise yesterday, coupled with drops in both the Swiss
franc and gold, indicated that the dollar still commands the
respect of international investors despite a weak U.S.
economy and falling U.S. interest rates. If the Soviet
Union's political situation deteriorates further, analysts
predict, the dollar will continue to climb.
   "At some point," Ms. Mills said, "the European investor
will say, `I don't care whether I get a lower rate of return
on dollar assets, and I don't care if the U.S. is in a
recession. I want to increase my holdings in the U.S. because
the dollar is the only real safe haven currency.' That move
may have begun in earnest."
   Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation is important because of his
close association with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
with Mr. Gorbachev's program to liberalize the Soviet Union
internally and conduct a more accommodating foreign policy.
Mr. Shevardnadze also is well known and respected outside the
Soviet Union. Analysts said his resignation raises the
possibility of two dangerous scenarios: either a return to a
hard-line dictatorship in Moscow or the ultimate breakup of
the Soviet Union.
   Turmoil in the Soviet Union has a direct and pronounced
effect on European markets, particularly Germany's, because
of Germany's proximity to Eastern Europe and the fact that
Germany is Moscow's largest trading partner in the West.
   "Germany was the market that benefited the most" from the
political and economic changes in Eastern Europe, said Steven
Keddell, a first vice president at Deutsche Bank Capital
Corp. in New York. Therefore, German markets stand to suffer
most from a reversal of those changes, he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   U.S. stock prices were mixed. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 174.7 million shares. Declining issues on
the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 813726.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
The yield on the issue rose to 8.23%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose sharply. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5115 marks and 135.85 yen, compared
with 1.4785 marks and 134.05 yen late Wednesday.
