   A Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. official said
workers at its Gatineau, Quebec and Thunder Bay, Ontario,
newsprint mills ratified new contracts, ending lengthy
strikes.
   The CP Forest official said a tentative contract agreement
was reached at its Dalhousie, Nova Scotia, mill and workers
there will vote on the pact within the next few days. The
three CP Forest mills have a combined annual capacity of
about 1.3 million metric tons, or about 8% of North American
newsprint capacity. A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.

   The CP Forest said the Gatineau and Thunder Bay mills,
both shut by strikes in September and October respectively,
will return to full operation by Jan. 2. CP Forest, Montreal,
a pulp and paper concern, is 80%-owned by Canadian Pacific
Ltd., a natural resources, transportation, communications and
real estate concern. Both companies are based here.
