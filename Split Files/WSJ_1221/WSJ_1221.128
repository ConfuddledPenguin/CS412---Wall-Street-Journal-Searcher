   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NCNB Corp. said it will add about $180
million to $190 million to its loan-loss provision in the
fourth quarter, which it said will cut earnings to the $25
million to $35 million range.
   The banking company's fourth-quarter earnings estimate is
equivalent to 24 to 34 cents a share. A year earlier, NCNB
had net income of $136.2 million, or $1.30 a share.

   The aggressive banking company said net charge-offs in the
current quarter will be $125 million to $135 million. Wall
Street analysts had been expecting a substantially smaller
number around the third-quarter level of $79 million.
   NCNB said the charge-offs cover troubled loans not only in
real estate but in commercial lending, including some of what
are called highly leveraged transactions. Frank Anderson, an
analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark., predicted
further problems for NCNB despite the large charge-offs and
provision. "I don't think this means a clean-up," Mr.
Anderson said.
   NCNB itself, like other banks that have been forecasting
large provisions for the quarter, said it couldn't be sure
the end of its problems are in sight. "If economic conditions
continue to deteriorate, we anticipate there will be further
additions to loan losses," the company's spokesman said.
   He pointed out, however, that the company still will show
a profit for the quarter and said its dividend is safe. For
all of 1990, NCNB expects to earn $360 million to $370
million, or $3.53 to $3.63 a share.
   The company expects its allowance for loan and lease
losses to rise to about $650 million or $660 million from
$593 million at the end of the third quarter. Nonperforming
assets are expected to rise to a range of $970 million to $1
billion at year's end from $847 million at the end of the
third quarter.
   NCNB, which faces substantial problems on large commercial
real estate portfolios in Florida and North Carolina, said it
also is taking a charge related to a credit card portfolio
that it acquired.
