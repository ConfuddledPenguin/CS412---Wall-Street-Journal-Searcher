   Sacramento, Calif. -- Dick Motta peered through his tinted
glasses and smiled. "I looked out there in the fourth quarter
and saw I had four rookies on the floor," said the coach of
the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings. "I
thought I must be crazy."
   But Motta saved his biggest grin for the Arco Arena
scoreboard here Tuesday night, because, at the end, it had
the Kings beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, 108-99. His
team, which had started the season with 13 losses in 14
games, now had won three in a row and five of its last seven.
That had yet to make a dent on the standings -- the Kings
still were last in the league's Pacific Division. It did make
for some nice internal consumption, though.

   "You work the kids as hard as I do, you like to see some
positive feedback," said the 59-year-old Motta. "Otherwise,
maybe they start thinking the old coach just has 'em running
in circles."
   Time was when a lot of people thought the "old coach," the
NBA's third-winningest ever, regarded using rookies the way a
vegetarian regards a hamburger. His glory teams, the Chicago
Bulls of the mid-1970s and the 1978 champion Washington
Bullets, were grizzled bunches who thrived on the
hand-in-the-face defense and grinding, half-court offense he
has always taught.
   Motta contends that was a bum rap -- it was just that he'd
never had many rookies he thought could play. Besides, that
was then and this is now. After five seasons of unrelenting
woe in the California capital (they've spent just a few days
above the .500 won-lost mark in all that time), the Kings are
embarked on about as thorough-going a youth movement as any
NBA club has tried.
   Trades involving the surrender of such notables as Rodney
McCray, Danny Ainge and Pervous Ellison helped bring the
Kings an unprecedented four first-round draft choices last
summer. As a further result of the swaps, the Kings have only
three players back from last year. One of them is the
weak-kneed Ralph Sampson, who rarely plays.
   This isn't what Motta had in mind when he ended a 1
1/2-year retirement to become Sacramento's fourth coach in
five seasons about one-third into the 1989-90 campaign. He'd
built winners from meager beginnings in Chicago and Dallas,
but says he'd never found a team so woeful as the Kings. They
were 7-21 when he arrived, and won but 16 of 54 under his
hand.
   "Some of the players were OK individually, but
collectively they had no life," he says. "Jerry Reynolds {the
team's director of player personnel} and I decided it would
be better to change the team than to try to change their
attitude."
   He adds: "I took this job because I wanted it, not because
I needed it, and with the understanding I could shape it to
my own specifications. I tried things the other way once.
Didn't like it at all."
   That "other way" was at Dallas, where Motta quit in 1987
after his team had posted a 55-27 mark, his best in seven
seasons there. "I found myself doing things against my
philosophy -- making compromises I shouldn't have," says the
man from Utah who 22 years ago coached in the first NBA game
he ever saw. "It didn't work for me, and it wouldn't have
worked for anybody for long. No job is worth that.
   "I want from my team what every other coach wants, which
is that they play each game like it was the seventh of a
championship playoff. Maybe the difference is that I expect
it instead of just hoping. People say the pro game has
changed, and it has. The players today are millionaires with
guaranteed contracts, and it's up to the coach to get them to
sacrifice their egos and function as a unit. It's tough, but
it's great when you can do it. I guess that's really why I'm
here."
   The "freshmen" that Motta is molding include 1990
first-round picks Lionel Simmons, a forward from LaSalle;
Travis Mays, a guard from Texas; Duane Causwell, a center
from Temple; and Anthony Bonner, a forward from St. Louis.
Forward Ricky Calloway, signed as a free agent out of Kansas,
gives the Kings five rookies.
   The most useful so far has been the snaky Simmons, who at
LaSalle accumulated the third-highest point tally in NCAA
history. He's been a starter averaging about 15 points a game
despite some erratic shooting. Mays, who some compare with
Joe Dumars of the champion Detroit Pistons, has done well
when back woes permitted. Bonner has had worse luck with
injuries, missing 17 games with a fractured foot, but has
shown exceptional speed and reflexes for a guy who's
6-foot-8. Causwell is a seven-footer who can shoot, but lacks
stamina.
   The Motta that's molding this crew has changed from his
earlier days. His signature tinted specs now are bifocals,
and he has tempered his formerly continual baiting of
officials to a point where he can occasionally joke with
them. ("Hey, Bill, check my guy for tooth marks," he remarked
to referee Bill Saar on Tuesday after he thought a foul had
gone in the wrong direction.) He thinks he's more open with
his players than he used to be, and more likely to pat their
fannies encouragingly than chew them verbally.
   Unchanged, however, is the Motta credo that hard work
cures all: Until last week he'd put the Kings through full
workouts every game day and two such sessions on off days, an
unheard-of regimen in the pros.
   The best return on that effort came Dec. 13, when the
Kings, owners of the league's worst record, upset the
Portland Trailblazers, who had the best. In Tuesday's
contest, which gave the Kings their first three-game win
streak since April 1989, Simmons had 14 third-quarter points,
Bonner had 18 and five steals, and Causwell made some key
plays.
   It was regular-season career victory 830 for Motta,
leaving him 108 behind Boston's Red Auerbach for top spot on
the NBA's coach's list. Motta says he'd like to set that mark
even though "it would be mostly because I coached longer than
Red, not better."
   He notes, wryly, that he's already done something rare in
NBA annals by posting his 800th career loss on Nov. 29
against Denver. "I told my kids we should have had a
champagne party to celebrate," he says. "How many coaches are
going to be in this league long enough to lose 800, and still
be working?"
