   HANCOCK, Mich. -- D&amp;N Financial Corp. said it will post a
large loss for the year and cancel its dividend for the
fourth quarter.
   D&amp;N officials said the company's net loss for 1990 could
be as high as $5.75 million, or about $1.54 a share. The loss
stems from increases in loan-loss reserves that the company
must make largely because of declining real estate values.
The company, whose sole subsidiary is D&amp;N Bank, also said it
will realize losses from sales of certain parts of its
investment portfolio.

   D&amp;N reported a net loss for 1989 of $10.4 million, or
$2.84 a share, as a result of charges to earnings in the
fourth quarter for additions to loan-loss reserves and
balance sheet restructuring. Through the first nine months of
this year, D&amp;N reported net of $800,000, or 21 cents a share,
compared with earnings of $2.3 million, or 63 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   D&amp;N officials said they canceled the dividend in response
to the company's financial position and prevailing economic
problems. "It is the unanimous position of the board that the
long-term interests of all stockholders are best served by
conserving capital, and by entering the new year with a
stronger loss-reserve position in the face of the general
economic downturn and declining commercial real estate
values," said Kenneth D. Seaton, D&amp;N chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company's third-quarter dividend had been reduced to
7.5 cents a share from a high of 15 cents for several
quarters prior to that. D&amp;N officials said its board will
make decisions about future dividends from quarter to
quarter, as they have in the past.
   But D&amp;N officials added that D&amp;N Bank will report capital
ratios that exceed the higher regulatory minimums that become
effective Dec. 31.
   D&amp;N has financial services offices throughout Michigan's
Upper Peninsula and in mid-Michigan, as well as mortgage
banking operations in Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, North
Carolina and Texas.
