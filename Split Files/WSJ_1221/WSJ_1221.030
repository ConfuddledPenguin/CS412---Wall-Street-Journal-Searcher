   NEW YORK -- After a two-week burst of headlines and
excitement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has settled
back to play a waiting game in its $6.12 billion bid for NCR
Corp.
   AT&amp;T, which launched a proxy fight Monday to back up its
$90-a-share hostile tender offer, is now looking to Jan. 15,
three weeks from now, as the next milestone in its campaign
to acquire the Dayton, Ohio, computer maker.

   That's when AT&amp;T expects to announce the percentage of NCR
stock whose holders want to sell despite NCR's determination
to remain independent. Around the same time, AT&amp;T expects to
announce the percentage of shares voting for a special
meeting to oust the NCR board.
   If, as AT&amp;T expects, between 60% and 80% of NCR
shareholders want to sell, and if more than 50% want a
meeting to vote out the board, that could put pressure on NCR
to agree to conduct friendly merger negotiations, instead of
holding out for $125 a share, or $8.5 billion.
   People close to AT&amp;T say executives of the
telecommunications giant have been surprised by the vehemence
of NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. in rejecting AT&amp;T's
$90-a-share offer. AT&amp;T evidently also has been surprised
that NCR won't hold merger talks.
   "I sense a growing frustration on the part of {AT&amp;T
management} to get this thing done," says Jack Grubman, a
telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Grubman
says AT&amp;T managers may have believed they could acquire NCR
"just by showing up" and may be growing "impatient."
   Mr. Grubman believes that AT&amp;T should raise its bid in
order to reduce the chances that a prolonged takeover battle
will damage NCR's computer business. But other analysts, such
as Maria Lewis of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., applauded
AT&amp;T's "discipline" in holding at $90 instead of bidding
against itself.
   Some people familiar with the situation say AT&amp;T continues
to regard Mr. Exley's rhetoric against the bid as posturing
before an eventual negotiation. They say AT&amp;T remains
committed to the acquisition, realizing it may take time to
complete.
   For its part, NCR seems to be digging in for a long fight,
playing for time in the hope that AT&amp;T may grow discouraged
or impatient between now and April 17, when NCR plans to hold
its annual meeting.
   As hopes have faded for a quick merger accord, NCR's stock
has faded steadily from a post-bid high of $92.875 to
yesterday's close of $87.75, unchanged, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   For now, both sides are keeping the gloves on, refraining
from some of the rougher tactics of proxy fights, such as
personal attacks on individuals or scathing critiques of
corporate track records. AT&amp;T hasn't sued NCR directors
personally. And a series of NCR ads this week has opted for a
restrained, gently mocking tone instead of thundering
denunciations.
   NCR appears to be pinning its legal hopes on a new variant
of the "just-say-no" strategy, saying it wants to remain
independent but is willing to conduct merger talks at a much
higher price level. Lawyers familiar with NCR point to
several cases, such as Universal Foods Corp., in which courts
haven't required boards of targets to drop their "poison
pill" anti-takeover defenses in the face of hostile bids.
   The broadest precedent is a bid by Paramount
Communications Inc. for Time Inc., which planned to merge
with Warner Communications Inc. Delaware courts refused to
force Time to drop its poison-pill defense to let
shareholders accept the Paramount bid, saying Time's board
had broad discretion to execute corporate strategy.
   AT&amp;T may be assuming this contest will resemble two
combined bid-and-proxy battles that ended this spring just
before each target's annual meeting. Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp. agreed to be acquired after a three-month seige by
Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Norton Co. sought a rescuing
acquirer under pressure from a bid-and-proxy battle by BTR
PLC. In each case, the target company agreed to be sold
rather than face overwhelming defeat in a shareholder vote.
   Steven Milunovich, an analyst at First Boston Corp.,
believes NCR executives "truly want to be left alone. The
people who at first thought this was just a negotiating
tactic didn't understand Exley." Still, Mr. Milunovich
considers a negotiated merger highly probable. He explains,
"It doesn't appear that many shareholders are willing to take
NCR's side."
