   DALLAS -- Southwest Airlines said it finalized a new $215
million revolving credit agreement with Texas Commerce Bank
as the lead lender.
   "The money is there for us to use, at our discretion, to
fund company needs ranging from operational costs to aircraft
acquisitions," said Herb Kelleher, Southwest's chairman. He
added that the company doesn't have any current plans to use
the credit.
