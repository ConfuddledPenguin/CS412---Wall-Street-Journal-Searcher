   Merck &amp; Co. disclosed that it has developed a novel type
of drug for fighting the AIDS virus, and that it started
pilot tests of the drug in humans last month.
   The drug was developed with unusual swiftness in less than
six months. It marks the first entry by the Rahway, N.J.,
drug maker into the world-wide effort to develop medicines to
defuse the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, the virus
that causes AIDS.

   The drug works by deactivating an enzyme called reverse
transcriptase that is necessary for HIV-1 to reproduce. The
pharmaceutical company said its new drug is different from a
drug reported just two weeks ago by researchers at Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals. The Boehringer and Merck drugs,
however, both work against the reverse transcriptase enzyme
in a manner that differs significantly from AZT, the only
drug now approved for use against the virus.
   While officials at Boehringer in Ridgefield, Conn., and at
Merck said that laboratory tests of their enzyme-blockers
show the drugs are more potent than AZT, officials aren't
certain that the new drugs are less toxic than AZT, or that
the drugs will work in people.
   Merck, however, appears to be ahead of Boehringer in
finding those answers since it began human-safety tests of
its new compound in an unnamed site in Europe last month.
Just last week, Merck began similar safety tests at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., administering
the drug to people who are infected by HIV-1 but who have not
yet developed problems in their immune systems.
   Actually, Merck said it is testing two separate, but
closely related, compounds, hoping that one of them works.
   Even so, officials at Merck were reluctant to talk about
the drugs or their prospects. "We never before have discussed
drugs this early because development at this stage is
completely unpredictable," said Edward M. Scolnick, head of
Merck's research operations. "One in five drugs at this stage
fail, and that could happen to these."
   Merck released information about the drug after it began
receiving recent inquiries. The company had hoped to keep its
research quiet until current tests indicate effectiveness.
   Dr. Scolnick said that in April, Merck found a chemical
that blocked the enzyme after testing about a thousand
compounds developed over the years. "We realized right away
we might have something," Dr. Scolnick said.
   He said the company's chemists and other researchers
performed a "heroically fast job" of developing the compounds
into drugs that could be absorbed into the bloodstream, and
then testing the drugs for toxicity in animals.
   Merck said the early animal tests suggest the drug has
minimal toxicity problems. It declined to comment on early
results from the human tests, but did acknowledge that tests
in Europe were continuing, an indication that the drugs
aren't causing major problems.
   News of the Merck drug is the most recent in a flurry of
reports by drug makers who are racing after ways of fighting
the AIDS virus, although none of these new drugs have yet
shown to be effective or safe. A Merck spokesman said the
company plans to publish the new drug discovery, but that the
finding is so recent it hasn't yet been accepted by a
research publication.
