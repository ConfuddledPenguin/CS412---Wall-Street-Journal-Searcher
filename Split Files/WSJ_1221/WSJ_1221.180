   Black &amp; Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its North
American Mallory Controls business for $90 million but
expects to report fourth-quarter earnings lower than
previously estimated.
   The Towson, Md., power-tool maker said it sold Mallory
Controls, which it acquired as part of last year's
acquisition of Emhart Corp., to Emerson Electric Co. It said
the Brazilian portion of the business is being offered for
sale separately.

   Emerson Electric, a St. Louis-based maker of electronic
products, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Black &amp; Decker has been selling assets in order to meet
payments on the $2.8 billion loan it used to buy Emhart. Last
month it sold its U.S. and Canadian assets in True Temper
Hardware as well as capital stock in True Temper Ltd. in
Ireland to Huffy Corp. for $55 million.
   The company also said it expects lower earnings due to
lower sales in the U.S. and deteriorating business conditions
in Brazil. "While we expect to offset most of the
sluggishness in the U.S. through aggressive cost-containment
programs, the difficulties in Brazil will result in
lower-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter," said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nolan D. Archibald.
However, he also noted that the company expects a profitable
fourth quarter compared with the net loss it reported last
year.
   Mr. Archibald said the company is actively pursuing the
sale of the Brazilian Mallory Controls business and will
implement major cost reductions in all Brazil operations.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Black
&amp; Decker shares closed down 25 cents to $10.75.
