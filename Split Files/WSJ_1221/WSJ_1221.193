   BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Office Depot Inc. and Office Club Inc.
said they agreed to merge in a transaction valued at about
$137 million.
   The two providers of office supplies said Office Club,
based in San Francisco, would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Office Depot and would continue to operate
under its own name with its current format.

   Analysts generally applauded the agreement, saying that,
while there would be some short-term dilution in Office
Depot's earnings, the match will give Office Depot both a
large presence on the West Coast and a stronger management
team.
   The combined companies will have sales of about $1.3
billion in 1991, analysts said, further strengthening Office
Depot's position as the No. 1 player in the so-called
super-store segment of office-supply sales. That segment may
account for as much as 5% of the total U.S. market for office
supplies.
   The two companies said Office Club holders will receive
1.194 shares of Office Depot common stock for each share of
Office Club stock. There are approximately 7.2 million shares
outstanding of Office Club common. In addition, Office Depot
will assume Office Club's outstanding options, currently
representing approximately 675,000 shares of Office Club
stock.
   The transaction, which will be accounted for on a
pooling-of-interests basis, is subject to shareholder and
regulatory approval. The two companies said they anticipated
closing the transaction next spring.
   David I. Fuente will continue to serve as chairman and
chief executive officer of Office Depot, which will remain
based in Boca Raton. Mark D. Begelman, Office Club's chairman
and chief executive, will become president and chief
operating officer of Office Depot.
