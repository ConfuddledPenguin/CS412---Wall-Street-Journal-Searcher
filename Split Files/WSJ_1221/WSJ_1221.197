   GEVEVA, Switzerland -- The lead administrator of Polly
Peck International PLC, an embattled U.K. electronics, fruit
and leisure group, said injunctions preventing an
investigation into funds in Cyprus have been lifted.
   Michael Jordan of the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand de
Loitte, one of three administrators appointed by a U.K. high
court to run Polly Peck, said that "an awful lot" of the
company's funds "seems to have found its way into Cyprus."

   Speaking to Polly Peck's Swiss franc bondholders here, Mr.
Jordan declined to give exact figures, saying, "In the coming
weeks, we hope to understand the situation much better."
Until it was placed into receivership Oct. 25, Polly Peck was
run by Asil Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot.
   Mr. Jordan's two fellow administrators are Richard Stone,
also of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Christopher Morris, an
accountant with Touche Ross &amp; Co.
   Mr. Jordan said injunctions preventing review of the books
of Japan's Sansui Electric Co., in which Polly Peck holds a
72% stake, also were lifted recently.
   Regarding Del Monte Foods Inc., a San Francisco-based
canned fruit and vegetable unit of Polly Peck, Mr. Jordan
said he expects 1991 profit to exceed forecasts of 1990
earnings. He said he is convinced the company is well run and
said it is unlikely the administrators would sell Del Monte
to satisfy Polly Peck creditor demands.
   Under U.K. bankruptcy rules, the administrators must issue
a report of their findings three months after being
appointed. Mr. Jordan said that their work has been hindered
because of the injunctions and that he will ask for a
three-month extension of the deadline. He estimated debt of
the Polly Peck PLC holding company at #1 billion ($1.94
billion) and total group debt at #1.4 billion. Of that total,
Polly Peck has issued 600 million Swiss francs ($471 million)
in bonds.
   Mr. Jordan said the administrators are looking into
selling some of what he called small non-core businesses. The
Polly Peck group encompasses around 200 separate companies,
he said.

   DEL MONTE FOODS Inc. of San Francisco, a privately owned
company, was incorrectly identified in the Dec. 10 edition as
a subsidiary of Polly Peck International PLC, which has a
subsidiary named PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co.
