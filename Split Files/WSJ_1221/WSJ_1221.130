   MOSCOW -- President Mikhail Gorbachev has paid an enormous
price for his attempt to impose more authoritarian rule on
the U.S.S.R.
   Yesterday, in an emotional public speech, Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze resigned, excoriating the political right
wing and warning darkly of a new "dictatorship" taking shape
in his country. His move deprives Mr. Gorbachev of one of his
closest and most liberal allies and dashes the president's
hopes of quickly forging a consensus between left and right
to deal with the social and economic crisis seizing the
nation.

   Though Soviet officials say the resignation won't change
the course of the country's foreign policy, the sudden
resignation is likely to affect Soviet relations with the
West, particularly the U.S. At the very least, it deals a
blow to the twin pillars of George Bush's foreign policy --
his new relationship with the Soviet Union and his coalition
arrayed against Iraq. Mr. Shevardnadze said he quit partly
because his tough stance against Baghdad was being severely
criticized at home. The resignation also points up the
vulnerability of the highly personal diplomacy of Mr. Bush
and Secretary of State James Baker, who in less than two
years in office met with Mr. Shevardnadze more than 25 times.
   For both the Soviet Union and the West, the question yet
to be answered is whether Mr. Shevardnadze's departure will
strengthen the hand of reactionary Soviet conservatives,
particularly in the military, or whether it will pull Mr.
Gorbachev back to a more conciliatory position with his
liberal critics. The former could usher in a dark new era
that would make the Soviet Union a far more unreliable
international partner, while the latter would speed a breakup
of the U.S.S.R. by forcing the Soviet president to cede many
of his powers to the 15 republics.
   "This is a very serious crisis for the president, the
country, and the whole of perestroika," said Sergei
Stankevich, a liberal democrat who is deputy mayor of Moscow.
"I think Gorbachev should take Shevardnadze's step as a very
serious signal that he's too far from the mainstream of the
real reform process."
   Sergei Blagovolin, a military expert at a leading Moscow
think tank, described the resignation as "a tragedy not just
for us, but for everyone."
   Mr. Shevardnadze made his surprise announcement in a
speech before the Congress of People's Deputies, the nation's
supreme legislature. Many of the legislators immediately
asked him to reconsider. But his spokesman, Vitaly Churkin,
called the decision irreversible, adding that only two
people, whom he didn't identify, had known about it.
   Mr. Gorbachev wasn't one of them. Looking grim, the Soviet
president told deputies: "Personally I condemn Comrade
Shevardnadze for acting so without consulting the president."
He said he had held two telephone conversations with Mr.
Shevardnadze following the speech, but still needed time to
analyze the reasons for his resignation. He seemed
particularly upset because, as he revealed, he had been about
to nominate Mr. Shevardnadze to be his vice president, a new
post that he wants to establish as a way to strengthen his
executive powers.
   The resignation may well not spell the end of Mr.
Shevardnadze's public role, however. It may not be accepted
by the congress, and if it is he could wind up back in
government, perhaps as vice president, should Mr. Gorbachev
change tack. A commentator for the TASS news agency even
suggested the decision was more of a tactic aimed at shifting
the domestic political debate rather than a serious showdown
with Mr. Gorbachev.
   Mr. Shevardnadze, 62 years old, gave a variety of
explanations for his action. By far the most damaging to Mr.
Gorbachev, with whom he has worked closely for almost six
years, was his bitter indictment of the nation's increasingly
authoritarian political mood -- a mood fostered by the
president himself. He warned: "A dictatorship is in the
offing -- I tell you that with full awareness. No one knows
what this dictatorship will be like." At the same time, he
called Mr. Gorbachev his friend and pledged continued support
for perestroika, the policy of reform that he helped
implement.
   In recent weeks, Mr. Gorbachev has adopted a harder line
toward the problems of economic decline and national
disarray. In numerous decrees, he has sought to recentralize
economic management and restore law and order, even replacing
his liberal interior minister with a hard-line KGB official.
But most of his instructions have been ignored or
contradicted by the nation's republics, which consider
themselves "sovereign" states in charge of their own affairs.
   Such conflicts have come to a head over a new "union
treaty," which Mr. Gorbachev originally wanted to have
completed by the end of this year, and over a new political
structure that would give the president much greater
executive powers. Four of the 15 republics have explicitly
refused to sign the union treaty, and at least six others,
including Russia, say they have severe reservations about so
much power being centralized in the Kremlin. Likewise, the
new presidential power structure has been attacked by many
republic leaders. Boris Yeltsin, the powerful president of
the Russian republic, on Tuesday accused Mr. Gorbachev of
trying to accumulate more power than even Joseph Stalin.
   Infuriated, Mr. Gorbachev has insisted he isn't a
dictator, though at the same time he has threatened to
overrule decisions made by the republics. Top military
officials and the KGB secret police have strongly supported
him, raising widespread fears that a crackdown could be
imminent.
   But until Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation, the Soviet
president was still attempting to forge a consensus on the
need for stronger central rule and his own more authoritarian
stance. It isn't clear how Mr. Shevardnadze dissented. But
many Soviet analysts say his decision to quit is aimed at
moving the pendulum the other wayforcing Mr. Gorbachev to
reconsider his new alliance with the military and other
hard-liners.
   Galina Sidorova, a foreign-policy commentator for the
Soviet magazine New Times who has covered many of Mr.
Shevardnadze's foreign trips, said she believed he resigned
in order to galvanize moderates into action against the
conservative wave. Others, including Mr. Yeltsin, said they
now expect Mr. Gorbachev to shift ground back to the center,
and thus regain some of his diminishing authority. Still,
many fear that the momentum for a crackdown has now grown too
strong to stop.
   Whatever the domestic repercussions, Mr. Shevardnadze's
departure seems bound to affect Soviet foreign policy. The
soft-spoken minister has played a crucial role in helping to
end the Cold War, allow Eastern Europe to go its own way and,
above all, establish a warm and cooperative relationship with
the U.S. Spurning the traditional ideology and dourness of
his predecessors, he has also frequently denounced the Soviet
military for its past adventures in places such as
Afghanistan. His support of the alliance against Saddam
Hussein, a former Soviet ally, further enraged the military.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Shevardnadze called the fight
with conservatives over Gulf policy "the last straw" in his
decision to quit.
   In Washington, news of the resignation stunned Bush
administration officials, who have been preoccupied with the
Gulf crisis. Secretary of State Baker tried and failed to
reach Mr. Shevardnadze by phone and hurried to the White
House to discuss the event with President Bush.
   Mr. Baker also scrambled to minimize the damage of the
announcement. In a rare on-camera press conference, he
repeatedly cited Mr. Gorbachev's pledge that Soviet foreign
policy won't change, insisted he wasn't concerned that Iraq
would take comfort from the move, and said that he, like Mr.
Shevardnadze, worried about repression in the U.S.S.R.
Reflecting on Mr. Shevardnadze, Mr. Baker added, "I am proud
to call this man a friend. . . . I'm going to miss him."
   Nonetheless, many officials in Washington worry that Mr.
Shevardnadze's resignation is sure to be read in Baghdad as a
sign that the coalition is weakening, that Iraq still has
powerful friends in the Soviet military and that Moscow might
not support an American-led military strike. So it may
encourage Saddam Hussein to stay in Kuwait, increasing the
chance that the White House would have to resort to war to
oust him.
   "It's a victory for Saddam Hussein," said Marshall
Goldman, a leading Soviet scholar at Harvard University. "It
puts our Persian Gulf policy into doubt because the {Soviet}
military was out to get Shevardnadze and many in the military
have supported Iraq."
   The close relationship Messrs. Bush and Baker had with Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, forged in meetings in Moscow,
Malta and Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in many telephone calls,
became the fulcrum of U.S.-Soviet policy. Until now, those
ties pushed into the background concerns over Mr. Gorbachev's
recent embrace of repressive figures and tactics at home.
   Even though Mr. Gorbachev said foreign policy won't
change, he may be forced by exultant hard-liners to install a
more hostile figure in the foreign ministry. "It'll be
surprising if we get a clone of Shevardnadze," said Harvard's
Prof. Goldman. "Gorbachev is probably going to have to find
somebody less accommodating to the U.S."
   One man getting mentioned as a candidate for the job is
Yevgeny Primakov, an ambitious academic and Arabist who is
one of Mr. Gorbachev's advisers. The Saudi Government is
known to dislike Mr. Primakov, which could complicate matters
in the Gulf.
   Beyond the Gulf crisis, the resignation casts doubt upon
the future of broader diplomatic issues such as the strategic
nuclear arms treaty now being wrapped up. Earlier this year,
the military leadership forced Mr. Shevardnadze to withdraw
some Soviet concessions on the treaty, but they were later
largely restored. Now, the generals may be emboldened again,
even though the arms pact is largely complete.
   In any case, if Mr. Bush travels to Moscow as planned Feb.
11 for a summit meeting, the focus is no longer likely to be
on signing the arms treaty, but on finding out where Mr.
Gorbachev stands. In resigning, Mr. Shevardnadze implicitly
asked Mr. Gorbachev whether he is siding with the forces of
democracy or dictatorship.
   The summit may also be forced to dwell on the prospect of
an internal crackdown by Mr. Gorbachev. Any move of this sort
would almost certainly force the White House to shun the
Soviet leader, no matter how agreeable he remains on issues
beyond Soviet borders.
   The Bush administration for months has ignored and even
played down Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to assuage the military
and KGB by acting tougher with dissenters. Last week, Mr.
Bush went ahead with an aid package for the Soviet Union
solely on Mr. Shevardnadze's pledge that any crackdown would
be strictly aimed at quelling crime and ethnic violence, and
wouldn't be used to quash peaceful dissent or fledgling
capitalism.
   But the resignation is sparking wide suspicion among U.S.
experts that, even as he publicly assured the Americans, Mr.
Shevardnadze privately feared a tough crackdown was coming,
including one in his native republic of Georgia.
   "It looks like the deal Gorbachev wanted to impose on the
republics wasn't acceptable to Shevardnadze," says Jerry
Hough of Duke University. "Shevardnadze may have a clear
sense that ugliness is going to occur in Georgia and he wants
history to know he opposed it."
   Within hours of the resignation, Mr. Baker began placing a
new emphasis on concerns about a crackdown. "Our new
relationship with the Soviet Union depends on its continuing
commitment to democratization and to reform," he said at his
press conference. "We would obviously be foolish, I think,
not to take the warning in Minister Shevardnadze's
resignation statement seriously."
   Officials in Washington consider the resignation a
profound event partly because Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Gorbachev have until now generally seen eye to eye. Only last
month, Mr. Gorbachev himself disclosed in a speech that his
foreign minister had been a key figure in initiating the
entire policy of perestroika. Mr. Gorbachev recalled how the
two had met on vacation during the dark days of Leonid
Brezhnev, and had talked frankly about their concerns -- at a
time when such discussions were politically dangerous. "This
is when Shevardnadze said that everything was rotten," Mr.
Gorbachev said.
   After a career spent mainly in the republic of Georgia,
where he eventually rose to head the ruling Communist Party,
Mr. Shevardnadze leapt to national prominence in July 1985,
when Mr. Gorbachev took office. In two days he was promoted
twice, to full membership in the party's Politburo and then
to foreign minister, a field in which he had no prior
experience but excelled.
   Outside the legislative hall yesterday, the public seemed
to sympathize with the man and his decision to resign.
"Shevardnadze fought a good struggle," said Alexander
Chernoshyov, a 21-year-old industrial worker, "but he
understood that it was in vain because an individual depends
on the state, not the state on an individual, so there was
nothing he could do."
