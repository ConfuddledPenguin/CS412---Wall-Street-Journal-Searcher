   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. said it is
conducting an internal company investigation in connection
with an alleged kickback scheme involving Israeli purchases
of U.S. weapons.
   As reported in the Washington Post yesterday, police in
Israel are investigating the Israeli air force procurement of
military equipment from U.S. contractors. The allegations are
that millions of dollars in kickbacks were siphoned off to
senior Israeli military officials who helped cover up
procurement fraud.

   General Electric, which supplied jet engines for Israeli
fighter planes, was one U.S. company cited in Israeli press
accounts of the allegations, according to the Washington
Post. The reports identified Herbert B. Steindler, a GE
executive, as having been the manager in charge of company
sales to the Israeli air force.
   "GE has become aware of the investigation by the Israeli
government," said a GE spokesman. "The company has initiated
its own internal investigation concerning the purchase orders
said to be involved in the Israeli investigation." He said GE
has informed the U.S. government of its actions, adding that
"GE is cooperating fully with the U.S. government
investigation."
   The spokesman declined to comment on when GE learned of
the allegations or when it began its own investigation.
