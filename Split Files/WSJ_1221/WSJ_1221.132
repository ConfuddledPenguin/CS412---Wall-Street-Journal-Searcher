   UNION, N.J. -- TransNet Corp., which markets and leases
personal computers, said directors authorized the purchase of
as many as two million, or an indicated 40%, of its
approximately five million common shares outstanding, in
open-market and private buy-backs that will be funded from
operations.
   Steven Wilk, president and chief executive officer, said
the company is completing a reorganization. Despite
consecutive quarterly losses since September 1988, Mr. Wilk
said, he expects good revenue growth.
