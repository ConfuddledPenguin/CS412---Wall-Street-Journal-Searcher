   HONG KONG -- Sir Run Run Shaw views his plan to buy a
stake in the R.H. Macy &amp; Co. as only an investment, and he
doesn't intend to participate in running the closely held New
York retailer, a spokesman for the movie investor said.
   He is mulling, however, "other forms of participation,"
such as board representation, said the spokesman.

   The spokesman acknowledged Macy's problems, including
relatively heavy debt, but he said Sir Run Run regards these
as short-term difficulties. "The company is well-managed.
It's got fine franchises," he said. "We're confident in its
longer-term prospects."
   Macy said this week that it had attracted as much as
US$187.6 million in new equity capital to be used to buy back
some of its depressed high-yield junk bonds. Sir Run Run has
agreed to buy $25 million of Macy's Series III preferred
stock, with an option to invest $25 million more by March 31.
He would become Macy's fourth-largest shareholder if the
option is executed.
   Macy also said that its nonmanagement investors have
agreed to purchase $119 million of Series III preferred stock
and that it has sold $18.6 million of Series II preferred
stock to several shopping-center developers.
   Sir Run Run, 83 years old, is among Hong Kong's wealthiest
individuals. His fortune is founded on the entertainment
business, but he also invests heavily in real estate. Macy is
his first major investment in the retail business.
   The Macy stake, like much of his wealth, is held
privately. His principal listed vehicle, Shaw Brothers (Hong
Kong) Ltd., owns movie theaters, produces movies and licenses
film releases. His about 67% stake in the company, at current
market prices, is valued at about HK$1 billion, or US$128.2
million).
   Through Shaw Brothers, Sir Run Run also controls
Television Broadcasts Ltd., which dominates Hong Kong's
television-broadcasting industry.
   The spokesman says Sir Run Run has no plans to boost his
Macy stake beyond what has been provided for in the option.
