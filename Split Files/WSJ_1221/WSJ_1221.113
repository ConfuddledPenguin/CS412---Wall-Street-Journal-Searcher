   An administration is supposed to be greater than the sum
of its parts. This is the week the Bush administration proved
that one of its parts -- Michael Williams -- is much greater
than the sum of its principles.
   Mr. Williams is the 37-year-old Education Department
lawyer who advised the Fiesta Bowl that college scholarships
conditioned on race break the law. The resulting uproar, and
partial White House reversal, has proved the mettle of Mr.
Williams, even as it's exposed the intellectual muddle in
this White House.

   The reversal had Chief of Staff John Sununu's elbow-prints
all over it. Somehow he concluded that colleges could finance
race-based scholarships with private money after all, though
still not with their own money. By several accounts, Justice
and White House lawyers told him this position was "legally
indefensible." But law gave way to politics.
   The last time Mr. Sununu tried to pretend he was a
civil-rights attorney, he was out-negotiated by Sen. Ted
Kennedy. This time he merely compounded the White House's
legal and political problems. Liberals claimed to be angrier
than ever after the new position, while conservatives spied
another sellout. They were both right. By week's end, senior
aides were hunkered down, says one source, "just hoping the
thing would go away." There's nothing like having the courage
of your convictions.
   All of which must have left the only honest person in this
flap, Michael Williams, asking why he'd taken the education
job. A prosecutor by training, Mr. Williams's real ambition
is to be a U.S. attorney. On Monday morning, he was called to
the White House and later took part in a telephone
conference. But the Sununu Doctrine was created without him.
The "revised" legal opinion was presented to him in the form
of, "How distasteful is it?"
   The answer was very. Yet he still walked the plank with
grace. He purged his own name from the press release but
bravely carried on with a Tuesday press conference. He
admitted to being "politically naive," but he defended the
indefensible as well as possible. In a wonderful irony, Mr.
Sununu was impressed enough to call and congratulate him.
   A few sophists want to blame both Mr. Williams and the
White House. They argue that since scholarships are reserved
for all kinds of categories (such as "colonial descent"), why
not for race too? One answer is that race is especially
combustible. No one riots over scholarships for piccolo
players or Daughters of the American Revolution; the U.S.
fought a war over the rights of blacks. The principle of
"colorblindness" may be unattainable, but as a matter of law
it is the only way to organize a just and stable society.
   Mr. Williams knows this better than rich, white columnists
because he has lived with the consequences of race-conscious
social "remedies." He grew up in Midland, Texas, says friend
Jesse Gaines, "on the other side of the tracks." His parents
taught at segregated schools. Busing forced their
integration, but at the price of shattering the black
community ties of parents with teachers, and parents with
children. That experience made him skeptical of social
engineering of all types.
   Such heresies are said to make Mr. Williams a
"conservative," which only shows how little that label means.
(He has not, so far as I know, declared his views on SDI.)
It's more accurate to say that he is one of those younger
blacks who, like author Shelby Steele, doubt racial
preference really helps the supposed beneficiaries, blacks
themselves.
   They are asking why every black achievement should be
tainted with the stigma of "racial preference." In his
eighth-grade parochial school, Mr. Williams was the only
black; yet he won the math prize, the spelling bee, and was
the best athlete too. "I don't remember us even discussing
issues in terms of race," says his father, John, who still
lives and coaches in Midland. "That may sound odd, but we
just didn't."
   Such thinking puts his son at odds with liberals devoted
to state paternalism. One "journalist" asked him, Wasn't he
"a lackey of the white power structure?" Another accused him
of having accepted a scholarship to the University of
Southern California. He hadn't, so the caller said, Ah,
that's the problem. You didn't need a scholarship. (In truth,
his scholarship ruling would not have denied financing to
needy minorities, only the well-to-do.)
   But Mr. Williams is also an enemy of those Republican
cynics who would exploit the racial preference issue --
"quotas" -- merely to inflame white resentments (and votes).
One of his first official acts was to write a letter opening
the legal way for Polly Williams to begin her educational
choice experiment in Milwaukee. He also has actively opposed
anti-Asian quotas in college admissions in California.
   Mr. Williams supported Mr. Bush's veto of the Kennedy
quota bill, but he wishes the White House would assert a
"positive" civil-rights agenda based on self-help and
economic opportunity. Mr. Williams's legal ruling could have
started that new debate, but the White House muzzled him
instead.
   The U.S. needs an honest debate about civil rights and
racial preference, and somehow they will be debated. If the
White House shrinks from that argument, the vacuum will be
filled by the destructive likes of the just-announced
candidate for Louisiana governor, David Duke.
