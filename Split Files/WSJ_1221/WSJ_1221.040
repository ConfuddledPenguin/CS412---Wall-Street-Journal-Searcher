   WASHINGTON -- The rate of homeownership in the U.S. fell
during the 1980s, the first decade-long decline since the
1930s, the government reported.
   The Census Bureau said 63.9% of all households owned their
homes in 1989, down from 65.6% in 1980. Nearly all the rest
rented. Homeownership, however, is still much more common
than it was in 1950, when 55% of households owned their
homes.

   The decline in homeownership during the 1980s was
particularly noticeable among younger Americans, who saw
housing prices in some regions soar beyond reach.
   Some 39.1% of households headed by a person under 35 years
old owned homes in 1989, down from 41.2% in 1982, the first
year for which such data are available. Among households
headed by someone over 50, the figure remained constant at
77.2%.
   Although homeownership rates in the Northeast and West
continue to be consistently lower than the national average,
the Northeast was the only region where a higher fraction of
households owned houses at the end of the decade than at the
beginning.
   Patterns of homeownership vary widely; renting is more
common in urban areas. In the District of Columbia, for
instance, only 38.7% of the households own their own homes.
In New York state, the fraction is 52.3% and in California,
it's 53.6%. But in West Virginia, 74.8% of the households own
their homes; in Maine, 73.6% do.
