   One of our recently returned hostages told a story about a
band of Iraqi soldiers who burst into the apartment of an
American official in Kuwait City. Hungry and thirsty after a
hot, sweaty day of pillaging and expropriating, they found
several bottles of white wine loose in the cupboard. They
removed the corks in traditional fashion -- by smashing the
necks off the bottles -- and then ransacked the place for
food, settling at last on a package of Gainesburger dog-food
patties. Peeling off the snug cellophane wrappers, they
gently sauteed the little pucks of horseflesh, adding perhaps
a splash of Worcestershire and a dash of MSG as a tenderizer.
All evidence suggests the young men went away deeply
impressed with Yank cuisine.
   Some people think this story is disgusting, but that's
because some people haven't been reading, as I have, a book
by David Steinman called "Diet for a Poisoned Planet: How to
Choose Safe Foods for You and Your Family" (Harmony, 392
pages, $21.95). The Iraqis' devil-may-care attitude toward
victuals evokes an earlier America. Once there was a country
that wowed the world with its scrapple, its blood sausage,
its head cheese. That country was ours, and it is gone. The
culinary derring-do of our forefathers has been replaced by
the phobias of a new generation of Americans who worry about
calories, chemical additives, pesticides.

   These are the readers for whom Mr. Steinman writes. "Diet
for a Poisoned Planet" is not, technically speaking, a diet
book; fretful fatties will be disappointed. Nor is it a
cookbook; it contains no recipes. And by no stretch of the
imagination is it a book of science. Ironically, the first
stupid statement in this book is not made by Mr. Steinman but
by one William Marcus, who is a scientist at, God help us,
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   "Cancer, we are told, is decreasing," he writes in the
foreward. This is simply not true . . . Cancer deaths have
risen from less than 1 percent of all deaths in the
nineteenth century to at least one out of five deaths (20
percent) in the U.S. today."
   Now, even an EPA scientist should be able to recognize
that this percentage increase is a slender datum indeed,
accounted for by several factors. Fewer people today die of,
say, tuberculosis and diphtheria than 100 years ago; hence a
proportionately higher number die of cancer. The likelihood
of cancer increases with old age, and as people live longer
the incidence of cancer increases. People smoke more tobacco;
they stay out in the sun too long; morbidity reporting among
doctors has vastly improved . . .
   Blah, blah, blah. Mr. Steinman is having none of it. There
is but a single cause for increased cancer deaths, he has
decided: the pesticides injected into a generous-bosomed
Mother Nature by a species ( Homo sapiens americanus) gone
cockeyed with hubris. The affable apple, the pulchritudinous
peach, the congenial cantaloupe -- all are drenched in long,
unspellable words that have at least one "z" in them. (In Mr.
Steinman's lexicon, plants treated with pesticides are always
"drenched," except in those cases when they're "saturated.")
   Even those among the new generation of Americans who share
his phobias -- who consider a Double Whopper and a
Gainesburger to be brothers under the wrapper -- will find
Mr. Steinman a remorseless counselor. Think you're neat
'cause you eat whole wheat? Guess again. "Wheat is heavily
sprayed both before and after harvest." He recommends
alternative wholegrain breads, which, when properly baked,
taste as if they're molded from birdseed mulch. You're proud
of all those fresh fruits you're eating? Moron. "Peaches are
dangerous. They're right up there with apples." And raisins?
Don't ask.
   "Sometimes," he writes, "it seems that nothing is safe to
eat, and that we live in a constant state of food anxiety."
Perfectly put. Indeed, the first few pages are enough to send
a credulous reader -- Mr. Steinman writes as if he expects no
other kind -- into a mealtime catalepsy. But any number of
biochemists could argue with the science of this book, and
win, by pointing out, for example, that well over 99% of the
pesticides we ingest are produced by plants themselves; or
that the animal-carcinogenicity tests from which Mr. Steinman
claims to draw his anxiety are now regarded as highly
dubious; or that the amount of pesticides taken in by the
average Americano is unimaginably small.
   Alas, Mr. Steinman's anxiety is impervious to scientific
reasoning because it is the science itself that makes him
anxious; his unease over technology is instinctive, a matter
of reflex. And sooner or later, he really wears you down.
Food anxiety is contagious because it plays on the darkest
forces in our personality, bloating the already debilitating
fears of the worry wart, the party pooper, the whiner.
Somewhere between "Plant Foods" and "The NonToxic Home," I
too felt myself succumbing to Mr. Steinman's fears about
"subtle neurotoxic effects." But then I found myself
contemplating a dinner consisting entirely of puffed millet
and mung beans, and snapped out of it quickly enough.
