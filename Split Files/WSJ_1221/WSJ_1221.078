   In his thoughtful review of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's
book "Final Analysis," Lee Lescaze briefly refers to Mr.
Masson's libel suit against the New Yorker, Alfred Knopf Inc.
and me, arising from the publication of my book "In the Freud
Archives" (Leisure &amp; Arts, Oct. 30). Mr. Lescaze writes, "He
has sued for libel, charging that Ms. Malcolm put words in
his mouth that made him appear egotistical, irresponsible,
and sexually promiscuous. Ms. Malcolm conceded she altered
some of Mr. Masson's quotes, but insisted the changes were
minor." In fact, I have never "conceded" any such thing or
"insisted" on anything of the sort. On the contrary, I have
steadfastly maintained that I quoted Mr. Masson accurately.
Nowhere in the mountain of documents that has formed during
the six years of the lawsuit can any such "concession" be
found.
   However, I cannot blame Mr. Lescaze for such a mistake. A
smaller but, in its way, more impassable mountain of
documents has accreted side by side with the legal one: the
press commentary about the lawsuit. In the writings forming
this mountain, the facts of the case have gotten so balled up
that even lawyers are beginning to lose their bearings and
are writing about the case with incomprehension. I believe
the confusion has arisen largely out of the fact that the
case never came to trial, but was disposed of under the rules
of a little-understood and rather arcane procedure known as
"summary judgment." (To date, two courts have dismissed the
suit; an appeal of the dismissal is pending before the
Supreme Court.)

   This procedure (if I may quote from a stab at describing
it that I made in an afterword to my book "The Journalist and
the Murderer") is "an expedient the law provides for
defendants who wish to avoid the expense of a trial. In
summary judgment, the defendant must demonstrate that the
plaintiff could not possibly win his case at trial. To make
this demonstration fit within the confines of Rule 56(c) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -- which stipulates that
summary judgment may be granted only when `there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact' -- the defendant is
often obliged to leave unchallenged dire accusations which,
at trial, the plaintiff would have to back up with evidence."
   To comply with Rule 56(c) in the Masson-Malcolm suit, the
court could not consider four pages of notes that I had
submitted as the source of certain quotations in my book,
because Mr. Masson contended they were "fabrications" --
i.e., had made them an "issue as to material fact." It was
the "as if" rules of the exercise that constrained it from
considering these notes, which show that Mr. Masson had
actually uttered words he denied uttering, as in one
frequently cited example, when he said that if he had moved
into Anna Freud's house after her death, "Maresfield Gardens
would have been a center of scholarship, but it also would
have been a place of sex, women, fun." (The quotation, which
appears on page 33 of my book, also appears almost word for
word in the contested notes.) Instead, it considered
corroborating quotations from 40 hours of taped interviews
(which Mr. Masson was obliged to accept as genuine) --
quotations in which, time and time again, over many months of
interviews, he returns to the same subject: "We were going to
pass women on to each other, and we were going to have a
great time together when I lived in the Freud house," and
"They're going to be calling the police on me every time I
give a party or something," and "It would take an Act of
Congress to get me out of Anna Freud's house." The court,
required by Rule 56(c) to pretend that the notes did not
exist, then ruled that even if the quotations in the book
were altered versions of statements in the tapes, the suit
could not prevail.
   Unfortunately, however, the "even if" formula of summary
judgment was taken by the press to mean "it is so." It is now
widely believed that I altered "We would pass women on to
each other . . ." to read "It also would have been a place of
sex, women, fun . . ." In fact, I made no such alteration.
What, in heaven's name, would have been my reason for doing
so? But, as I said earlier, summary judgment is devilishly
hard to grasp.
