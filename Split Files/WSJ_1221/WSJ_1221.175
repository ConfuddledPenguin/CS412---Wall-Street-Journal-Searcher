   Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc., New York, citing negative
fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis, posted a 25% decline in
fiscal third-quarter net income on a 22% drop in revenue.
   Net income in the quarter, ended Nov. 30, was $2.1
million, or 22 cents a share, down from $2.8 million, or 29
cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to
$22.8 million from $29.3 million.

   For the nine months, net income fell 1% to $8.8 million,
or 93 cents a share, from $8.9 million, or 94 cents a share.
Revenue rose 4% to $83.1 million from $79.9 million.
   The brokerage company blamed the decline on lower
commission and interest income, because of investor caution
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Quick &amp;
Reilly closed at $11, up 50 cents.
