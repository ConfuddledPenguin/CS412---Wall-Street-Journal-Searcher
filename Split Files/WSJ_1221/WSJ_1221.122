   FRANKFURT -- Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz AG,
said the group's confidence was never greater than it is now
despite "clouds looming in the business sky."
   Mr. Reuter, who oversees Germany's largest industrial
group, said he expects the group's 1990 net income to exceed
last year's net of 6.8 billion marks ($4.6 billion).

   The group's 1990 sales are expected to have risen about 5%
to 86 billion marks from 76 billion marks a year ago, the
chairman said. Daimler is scheduled to release its 1990
financial results sometime in February.
   Mr. Reuter also expects 1991 will be a good year, but
declined to elaborate. However, he said he is concerned about
the strong mark, which has led to currency conversion losses
on dollar- and yen-denominated sales, and economic weakness
among Germany's trading partners.
   Germany's economy is expected to grow, but Mr. Reuter
warned of excessive wage demands by workers throughout former
West Germany.
   He said that in the long term, the company might have to
switch some of its production into the "dollar realm" so that
production costs and sales are made in the same currency and
less revenue is lost in the conversion.
   Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H., the German partner in the Airbus
Industrie consortium, is making losses on its airplane sales.
The results of Deutsche Airbus aren't factored into the
consolidated group results. Mr. Reuter said that talks will
be held with the German government to discuss the losses. The
German government subsidizes currency-related losses on
Airbus jets.
   Mercedes-Benz AG, the vehicle-making arm of the concern,
increased passenger car production by 6% to 572,000 vehicles
this year. In the U.S., despite economic weakness there, the
company sold 75,000 cars in the year, an improvement on last
year. Japanese sales of Mercedes vehicles rose 25% to 40,000.
For 1991, about the same production level as 1990 is planned.
   At AEG AG, the big electronics subsidiary of Daimler-Benz,
1990 sales rose 9% to 13 billion marks in certain key growth
areas like electronics, automation and railroad systems.
