   NEW YORK -- William H. Donaldson, chairman-designate of
the New York Stock Exchange, wants to greatly expand the
number of foreign stocks trading on the Big Board to make it
"pre-eminent on the international stage."
   Mr. Donaldson's program, sketched out in an interview
yesterday, marks a new era for the exchange and the U.S.
securities markets.

   For years, the Big Board has been content with being home
to the stocks of the biggest U.S. companies. But with the
rapid internationalization of investing, Mr. Donaldson
forsees a new role for the Big Board. He wants to capitalize
on the exchange's powerful franchise as a central,
well-regulated market and make shares of top companies around
the world easily available to U.S. investors.
   Mr. Donaldson, who takes office Jan. 1., indicated that he
will tackle the major issue that has impeded the trading of
large numbers of foreign stocks on the Big Board -- the fact
that most big foreign corporations don't meet stringent U.S.
financial disclosure and accounting rules.
   "We have to work with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Congress and try and get some some rules here
that will allow the listing of these securities," Mr.
Donaldson said.
   The Big Board currently lists about 100 foreign stocks for
trading, many in the form of American depositary receipts, or
ADRs, which represent an interest in shares that are kept in
the custody of a foreign bank.
   But many of the biggest foreign corporations, like
Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, cannot trade on
major U.S. exchanges.
   "There's a lot more international investing by U.S.
citizens," Mr. Donaldson said. "I think the challenge is {for
the Big Board} to maintain and become the premier exchange in
the world. You are going to see U.S. portfolios more evenly
divided between U.S., European and Far East securities. I
hope to move in that direction in terms of listings.
   "We can't do that overnight," Mr. Donaldson added. "There
are rules and regulations against it. But that's on the top
of the agenda."
   Mr. Donaldson appears to be trying to head off
developments that some traders say could gradually erode the
Big Board's status as one of the few major world stock
exchanges. Some traders point to the success of the London
stock exchange's Seaq International system, a lightly
regulated, computerized market that now accounts for about
40% of the volume in many major European stocks.
   Mr. Donaldson said he remains committed to the Big Board's
auction-style market, where buyers meet sellers on the floor
of the exchange. "I believe the best market is the auction
market," he said, criticizing the lack of order and price
disclosure in off-exchange markets.
   Mr. Donaldson, the 59-year-old co-founder of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, will succeed John J. Phelan Jr. as
chairman of the nation's largest stock exchange. He indicated
that he will count on a staff that will be given larger
responsibilities, on the exchange's power as a regulator, and
on his years of contacts with the top professionals in the
securities industry.
   In his first years at his own firm, DLJ, Mr. Donaldson's
signature phrases were, "Let's sleep on it," and "Let's wear
the white hat," recalls co-founder Richard Jenrette, now
chairman of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.,
the big insurer which bought DLJ in 1984 for $423 million.
"He's not likely to preside over the status quo," Mr.
Jenrette says, but "he's not a hip shooter. Deep down, he's a
pretty conservative person."
   Indeed, at a time when a lot of foreign investing is
taking place through bets on derivative securities -- such as
the popular put warrants based on the Nikkei index of 225
Japanese stocks -- Mr. Donaldson indicated that he would
rather see investors gain overseas access on Big Board by
buying actual shares of companies.
   Still, he would like to see the exchange cautiously
embrace derivative securities, recognizing them as
legitimate, but possibly risky, hedging and investment
vehicles.
   "The way to make money is to select companies that are
doing things and growing," he said. "Short-term orientation
is counter-productive to that. . . . We have to go slow on
some of these {derivative} instruments. I don't mean to
condemn derivatives, I just want to make sure people who have
manufactured derivatives have assessed the risk."
   Mr. Phelan is stepping down as Big Board chairman after an
influential 19-year tenure as an exchange policymaker,
including 5 1/2 years as chairman. He guided the exchange
through a turbulent decade, which included the 1987
stock-market crash, the disappearance of several securities
firms and the rapid growth in stock trading.
   Initially, Mr. Donaldson's toughest job will be mediating
between the warring interests that have battled over
commission rates, trading rules and regulations for years.
   Another high priority will be stemming the exchange's loss
of market share. Through November, the Big Board handled
66.3% of all trades in its own stocks, and 82.3% of total
shares traded.
