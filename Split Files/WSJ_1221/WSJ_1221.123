   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Standard &amp; Poors Corp. said it lowered
its rating on the claims-paying ability of Travelers
Indemnity Co. Intercompany Pool, the property-casualty
company of Travelers Corp., to double-A from double-A-plus.
   The rating concern said the action on the insurer reflects
S&amp;P's view that "property-casualty conditions will continue
to deteriorate over the near term."

   S&amp;P also downgraded to double-A from double-A-plus its
rating on the subsidiaries of the property-casualty company,
including Charter Oak Fire Insurance Co., Phoenix Insurance
Co., Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, Travelers Indemnity
Co. of Illinois and Travelers Indemnity Co. of Rhode Island.
   This marked the third S&amp;P downgrading of Travelers Corp.'s
businesses since the company announced a $650 million
addition to loss reserves for mortgage loans and real estate
investments and a dividend cut on Oct. 5. S&amp;P has since
reduced its ratings on the senior debt and commercial paper
of the holding company, and the claims-paying ability of
Travelers Insurance Co., the life insurance company, to
single-A-plus from double-A-minus.
   In the property-casualty company's downgrading, S&amp;P cited
its expectation that Travelers Corp.'s problems with its real
estate and mortgage portfolios will leave the
property-casualty business less flexible financially.
   A Travelers spokesman said that the rating action was
expected and that a double-A rating is "considered very
strong."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Travelers shares closed at $17.125, up 12.5 cents, on volume
of more than 1.9 million shares.
