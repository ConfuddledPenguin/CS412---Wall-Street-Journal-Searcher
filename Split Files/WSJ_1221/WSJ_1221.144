   If shopping for that special someone is a trying
experience, how about trying an experience as your gift?
   Like a four-day llama trek in the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest near Pinetop, Ariz. Or a day at the beach --
with the sand and a professional sand sculptor brought to
you.

   Neiman Marcus, of course, is known for offering a few such
enticing -- and expensive -- gift ideas (along with more
traditional fare) in its Christmas catalog. But the llama and
beach offerings are two of dozens in a mail-order catalog
titled "A World of Special Experiences."
   The experiences catalog is the brainchild of Debra Keyes
Denniston, a Los Angeles lawyer-turned-entrepreneur, who
contends that gift recipients tire of "things they can
collect." She and her husband last year formed a company,
Experientia Ltd., to test the market for gifts not easily
tied up with a fancy bow.
   This year's 48-page catalog offers an array of ideas, from
around $10 to $27,500. The llama trip goes for $599 a person.
And the "anytime, anywhere" beach party is only $3,199. (That
includes the sand artist -- and a butler to provide a gourmet
picnic for two.)
   For the musical-theater lover on your list, underwrite a
show at the Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Conn. -- for
$15,000. There are no takers yet for the most-expensive item:
underwriting a production by the Miami City Ballet. (Neiman
Marcus says its $5,898-a-person Mardi Gras trip isn't sold
out yet, either.)
   What's popular? "Anything to do with flying," says Ms.
Denniston, such as a hot-air-balloon ride ($132 a person).
Jerry R. Gossel, a Bozeman, Mont., real-estate appraiser,
ordered the sailplane ride for two -- for his ex-wife in
Washington, D.C. The out-of-the-ordinary gift, he says, "will
leave some very good memories."
   Ms. Denniston brokers each gift arrangement after a
customer has paid for it. She gets an undisclosed commission;
the recipient must schedule the experience. This year, she
says, customers are more cost-conscious than last year,
preferring moderately priced offerings. A $47 canoe trip for
two on Northern California's Russian River is moving well.
But orders like that don't generate hefty commissions.
Consequently, she says, "we haven't reached our projections
for this year."
   But she can relieve any frustrations during an $8,999
weekend -- helping a demolition team blow up a building.
