   Is hindsight really 20/20? Had there been a United Nations
ready to assemble when Hitler invaded Austria, would the
resolution then have read:
   "Noting that despite all efforts by the United Nations,
Hitler refuses to comply with 11 separate resolutions, the
Security Council therefore:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   (1) demands that Hitler comply with the resolutions;
   (2) allows Hitler one final opportunity as a pause of good
will;
   (3) authorizes all necessary means to implement the United
Nations resolutions unless Hitler stops by Jan. 15;
   (4) requests that states concerned keep the council
regularly informed of progress."
   What really has our vision of history taught us?
