   BOSTON -- Paul Quirk, executive director of Massachusetts'
public-employee pension fund for six years, announced plans
to resign amid a ruckus over his role in a possible proxy
fight for USX Corp.
   Mr. Quirk, 49 years old, said he would resign effective
Jan. 15, but would continue working on a contract basis until
March 15 to aid the transition to his successor, who hasn't
been named.

   Mr. Quirk earlier this week withdrew from a five-member
group backed by New York investor Carl Icahn that may launch
a proxy fight against USX next spring. Mr. Quirk also
returned the $15,000 plus 300 shares of USX stock Mr. Icahn
agreed to pay each group member.
   While Mr. Quirk's role in the Icahn group had been cleared
by the Massachusetts fund's lawyers, it drew fire as
inappropriate from some of the fund's nine-member governing
board.
   Mr. Quirk said the latest controversy accelerated
departure plans he disclosed to the fund's governing board
last summer. With a new governor taking office in January,
Mr. Quirk said he had, in any event, intended to leave his
post by the July start of the fund's new fiscal year. He said
he had no job plans yet.
   Mr. Quirk, as executive director of the fund, known
formally as Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment
Management Board, oversaw the retirement system's growth to
nearly $3 billion in assets from about $400 million in 1984.
