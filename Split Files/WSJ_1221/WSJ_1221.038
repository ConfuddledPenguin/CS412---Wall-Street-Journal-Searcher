   TOKYO -- Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., as part of its
strategy to widen further its international operations and
expand its new product base, said it agreed to buy the
pharmaceutical division of Royal Gist-brocades N.V. of the
Netherlands. The price wasn't disclosed.
   A Yamanouchi spokesman said the purchase of the division,
which has operations in Western Europe and the U.S., is
expected to be completed by the end of February. Established
in 1870, Royal Gist-brocades had 1989 sales of about 1.9
million guilders ($1.1 million), of which its pharmaceutical
division accounted for 13%, or about 240 million guilders,
Yamanouchi said.
