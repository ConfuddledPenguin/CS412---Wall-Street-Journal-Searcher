   SEOUL -- South Korean government officials find themselves
facing a credibility gap as they try to assure the U.S. that
Seoul isn't reverting to an anti-import trade policy.
   Korean trade officials in Seoul and Washington complain
that U.S. officials no longer believe them. U.S. officials
say their perception is correct. Ambassador Donald Gregg said
in a recent speech here to the Korean Council on Foreign
Relations: "Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and tell
you truthfully that all is well with the relationship. It is
not."

   The result is that South Korea, which two years ago was
considered the most cooperative nation in correcting trade
wrongs, is now far down the list, way below Japan.
   "That is the funny thing when confidence erodes," says
Sandra J. Kristoff, assistant U.S. trade representative in
charge of Korea. "It takes a long time, but when it is gone,
it is gone with a vengeance. It takes a long time to get it
back."
   The reason for the loss of confidence is an anti-import
campaign that the South Korean government supported, yet
continued to deny was occurring even after U.S. and European
executives in Seoul compiled massive evidence.
   Mars Co. recently had a major problem getting its holiday
candy off the docks in Pusan. The Koreans insisted it be
thoroughly inspected for sugar content. Marriott Corp. has
been asking for two years to set up an airline-food facility
near Seoul's international airport, but the permission has
been delayed even after domestic competitors have set up
their kitchens. The South Korean government is now
strong-arming fast-food makers into using domestic frozen
french fries instead of imported ones.
   To help with Korea's credibility problem, President Roh
Tae Wo sent Cho Soon, the former deputy prime minister, as a
special envoy to Washington.
   Mr. Cho tried to smooth ruffled feathers in Washington by
saying that there was no anti-import campaign, but rather "a
series of rather irritating incidents" and a
misunderstanding.
   "It has been so obvious and so intense, they can't buy out
of it by saying it is all a misunderstanding," replies one
State Department official. Ms. Kristoff calls the Korean
response disingenuous.
   Bridging the credibility gap is all the more difficult
because Korean newspapers are taking an increasingly
anti-foreign, and particularly anti-American, tone. A
presidential adviser says, "Newspapers are playing up the
anti-American feeling and it spreads very easily."
   Officials, who once denied that the government was behind
an anti-import campaign, now admit that the government did
want to moderate consumption and therefore targeted the
consumption of imports. Now, they cannot make a public
distinction between opposition to consumption and opposition
to imports.
   "Within the government there is a consensus now that the
anti-consumption campaign is different from an anti-import
campaign," says an official with the Ministry of Trade and
Industry. But like scores of government officials interviewed
for this article, he wouldn't let his name be used for fear
that the media would criticize him for "caving in" to the
U.S.
   When the American Chamber of Commerce complained in a
private meeting with government officials that the
anti-consumption campaign was being used by some bureaucrats
to restrict imports, the complaints were leaked by the
government to the Korean press. That set off a firestorm of
protest in the press. The respected Chosun Ilbo ran a
front-page story headlined, "Indiscriminate U.S. trade
pressure interferes in domestic affairs."
   Radical students and the main opposition party seized on
the issue. The Fraternity of Bereaved Families of Korean
Independence Fighters and Love-The-Motherland Movement
Council announced it would start a nationwide boycott of
U.S.-made goods in retaliation.
   In his tough speech, Ambassador Gregg spoke out against
the "emotionalism" in every sector of Korean life,
particularly the press.
   The reaction was predictable. One politician accused him
of treating Korea as if it were the 51st state. The newspaper
Kukmin Ilbo said the feelings expressed in the Ambassador's
speech, "were something like the feelings one experiences if
one's face is scratched by his sweetheart or if slapped by a
younger brother."
