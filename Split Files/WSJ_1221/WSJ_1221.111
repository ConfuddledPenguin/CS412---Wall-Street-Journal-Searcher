   WASHINGTON -- An influential member of the House Banking
Committee said he will seek tougher conflict-of-interest
rules in the financial system, following an investigation of
a director of the quasi-government Topeka Home Loan Bank, who
borrowed $6 million from thrifts he regulated.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) released a report by a
House task force that outlined how Richard H. Hughes, the
director, defaulted on $2.8 million of $6 million in loans.
Mr. Hughes, who served on the Topeka, Kan., bank's board from
1979 until a week ago, also unsuccessfully sought to acquire
two thrifts under the management of the Topeka bank.

   Mr. Hughes's failure to disclose that he moved from Topeka
to Dallas while he was still a director of the Topeka bank
apparently was his only violation of government regulations.
Rep. Schumer asserted that because Mr. Hughes didn't
specifically violate thrift regulations, his actions clearly
make tougher conflict-of-interest rules necessary.
   "Even the possibility that a government official could own
a thrift for which he might also oversee credit decisions is
extremely troubling," said Rep. Schumer. He added that Mr.
Hughes "epitomizes the inherent potential for
conflict-of-interest that fueled the ongoing thrift crisis."
   Mr. Hughes, also the president of Hinderliter Industries
Inc., Dallas, was removed from his position at the Topeka
bank a week ago, following the conclusion of the
investigation. He was out of his office yesterday and
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Under previous S&amp;L laws, the 12 regional home loan banks
were both a source of housing funds for the S&amp;L industry and
served as thrift examiners and regulators. Last year's
savings-and-loan cleanup law severed that link.
   The home loan banks are currently under the direction of
the Federal Housing Finance Board, an arm of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development. A spokesman for the Finance
Board said that after learning of the House investigation,
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp delayed roughly 25 appointments to
the regional home loan banks, pending review. The Finance
Board will also require more extensive financial disclosure
of the regional bank directors, a spokesman said.
   The actions of Mr. Hughes, first reported in regional and
trade publications, had been challenged by several Topeka
bank employees, the report said. Those concerns particularly
stemmed from his attempt to acquire two S&amp;Ls that were
regulated by the Topeka bank, Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Claremore, Okla., and Valley Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association of Hutchinson, Kan. Mr. Hughes had borrowed
$1.1 million from Valley Federal that became delinquent. The
thrift was later seized by the government.
   According to the report, Mr. Hughes was asked to resign in
1988 and 1989, and refused. The Federal Housing Finance Board
fired Mr. Hughes the day after receiving a copy of the House
task force report. He was succeeded by Sister Lillian Murphy
of Mercy Housing Inc. in Denver.
