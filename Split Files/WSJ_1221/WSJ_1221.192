   WASHINGTON -- USX Corp. agreed to pay fines of $3.3
million to settle charges of workplace health and safety
violations at its Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill and its
Clairton, Pa., coke works.
   The settlement was the largest in the history of the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
far exceeding the $1.6 million that Chrysler Corp. agreed to
pay in April 1988.

   But the USX amount was scaled down sharply from the $7.3
million in fines OSHA had proposed in November 1989. Besides
agreeing to the fines, USX pledged to end violations related
to hearing-impairment, electricity, communications with
workers about hazards, crane operation, and recordkeeping at
the Fairless and Clairton facilities. The company also agreed
to undertake corporatewide programs for abating those health
and safety hazards.
   USX agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt as to
the allegations.
   "There are other provisions of this settlement agreement
far more important to worker safety and health than the
penalties," said Gerard Scannell, assistant secretary of
labor for OSHA.
   OSHA had said three workers have died at the Fairless and
Clairton plants in the previous two years and 17 have died
since 1972. The agency charged that USX managers knew about
many safety deficiencies at the plants for years and failed
to take action to counteract them. OSHA also said USX didn't
properly record injuries at the Fairless plant despite
pledging to do so in April 1987.
   In addition to extending the safety effort to other plants
in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Alabama, USX's USS steelmaking
division promised to meet with the Indiana state officials to
seek a similar agreement covering the Gary, Ind., steel
plant. Indiana runs its own OSHA-approved occupational safety
and health program.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
USX closed at $30.50 a share, unchanged.
   The company agreed to the settlement partly to avoid long
and costly litigation, said Thomas Sterling, vice president,
employee relations, for USS. But he said the company has
"many areas of substantial disagreement over the OSHA
allegations." He said the Fairless and Clairton works are
"safe plants," and the USS division has set "a superb safety
record."
   The settlement was backed by United Steelworkers of
America Locals 1557 and 4889, which represent workers at the
two plants. While applauding the fines, the union said the
agreement confirms its contention that USX "willfully allowed
the safety and health conditions in its facilities to
deteriorate to such a point that workers were in serious
danger."
   The company continues to refuse to give the union reports
that it sent to OSHA describing its plans for correcting the
violations, the Steelworkers said. That signals "more battles
over safety and health at a time when other steel companies
have joined with the union in a variety of safety-related
programs," the union said.
   Responding to the union allegation, the USS division said
it and the union have safety committees at various plants,
which it said work together cooperatively and effectively.
   The USX fines don't reflect new maximum penalties for
workplace health and safety violations. Set by Congress in
the recently enacted budget law, those fines can be as much
as seven times earlier maximums; they provide for penalties
of as much as $70,000 for each "willful" violation.
   The new schedule will be applied to violations occuring on
or after Nov. 5, 1990, the effective date of the legislation,
and involving OSHA inspections begun after March 1, 1991.
