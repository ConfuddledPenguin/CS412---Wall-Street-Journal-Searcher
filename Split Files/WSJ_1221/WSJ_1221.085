   I hope those who prattle about proposed capital-gains tax
reductions being a "break for the rich" read your story about
John Kling and his wife ("Autumn Years," page one, Nov. 13)
and have some insight about what those levies really do. When
Mr. Kling had to surrender his Gulf stock, (the backbone of
his life savings) he saw capital-gains taxes chew away the
nest egg he was counting on for retirement.
   The upshot of making capital-gains taxes oppressive is to
penalize those frugal enough to make even a modest investment
or two during their lifetime. Not just the "rich." (And I'm
amazed at what some people call rich.) But considering the
credit-card-junkie mentality of this country, our illustrious
leaders included, I guess penalizing the prudent among us is
right in line with reality.

   Your article consisted primarily of anecdotes, including a
bleak portrayal of elderly people who might be considered
"poor." There was no mention of just how rare such people
are. The official poverty rate for the elderly is only 6%,
yet the rate is 20% for American children. Ours is the only
developed country in the world with such a generational
reversal.
   People over age 65 constitute the wealthiest social class
in the country, with more than $8 trillion in net worth, not
counting pensions and Social Security. Today's retirees who
receive Social Security have higher incomes than those paying
the tax. They're receiving two to seven times what they put
in. Medicare recipients are receiving five to 20 times the
actuarial value of prior contributions. Significant cuts are
prevented by the most powerful lobby in the country, the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   As this politically powerful and self-interested portion
of our population continues to swell, their benefits are paid
for by young workers who will never see the same benefits.

   As an Elderlaw practitioner, I am reminded constantly that
the difference between the (well-off) Brethauers and the
(downtrodden) Klings and Macons is, basically, luck -- the
former are apparently healthy, and the latter are not. We
don't have a national health-care system in this country, a
fact that doesn't really confront many people until
retirement, when their incomes are fixed and their bodies are
more likely to be deteriorating. When they come to see me
about a potential nursinghome placement they are astonished
to find out that they have lost in the draw if they have an
illness for which neither insurance nor Medicare will pay,
and they must exhaust their assets to receive assistance from
Medicaid, often leaving their spouses impoverished.
   When there is no national leadership in a problem area, no
rational planning is done, and whatever emerges is a result
of many political compromises and has almost nothing
whatsoever to do with what the real needs are.

   It was good to read that Mr. and Mrs. Brethauer enjoyed
Monet's Gardens at "Givenchy." I only hope that Mrs.
Brethauer was wearing her "Giverny" gown while she was there.
