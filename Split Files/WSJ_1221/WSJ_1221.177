   NEW YORK -- Perceptions of growing political turmoil in
the Soviet Union roiled international bond markets yesterday,
hammering prices and boosting yields.
   Early yesterday, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned his position
as Soviet Foreign Minister and warned that "dictatorship was
coming" to the Soviet Union. His departure is seen creating
more problems for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

   "The hint of anarchy is very unnerving to the bond
market," said David McClean, a proprietary trader at Credit
Lyonnais Securities USA, a unit of the big French bank.
   Erick Muller, bond market economist at Credit Commercial
de France, said the Shevardnadze resignation brought the
Soviet Union's problems to the forefront and "showed
{investors} what a big problem the U.S.S.R. can become."
   Analysts worry that should the Soviet Union disintegrate
into chaos, others countries in Europe -- especially Germany
-- could be faced with a flood of refugees. To finance the
potentially enormous cost of absorbing the refugees, along
with other costs associated with helping to stabilize the
Soviet Union, European governments will be forced to borrow
enormous amounts of money in the credit markets. Such
borrowing, in turn, would put upward pressure on European
interest rates.
   Even before the Shevardnadze resignation hit the news
wires, bond market sentiment in Europe was bearish due to
speculation that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may
soon raise interest rates another notch in an effort to wring
out inflation. In turn, that could force other European
countries, such as France, to raise rates also.
   Klaus Baader, a bond market analyst with UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew in London, said that while political uncertainty in the
Soviet Union "is bad news for bonds all around" the world,
it's particularly bad for Germany because German banks have
lent the Soviet Union billions of marks, all of which are
guaranteed by the Bonn government. The latest loan, for 1.2
billion marks ($811.9 million), was signed Tuesday.
   In addition, trade with the Soviet Union remains important
for industries in eastern Germany. "If you take away that
last bit of demand for eastern German industry, it's going to
make the adjustment process that much more difficult."
   In trading yesterday, bonds issued by Germany and France
were hardest hit of the major government bond markets,
followed by Britain and the U.S.
   Germany's benchmark 10-year government bond, or bund, fell
nearly one point to a price of 100.3 to yield 8.83%. France's
8.5% 10-year bond also fell nearly a point to 91.32 to yield
9.99% while the 8.5% 30-year bond fell 1 7/8 points to 85.65
to yield 10.04%.
   In Britain, the benchmark 11.75% gilt due 2003/2007 was
quoted at 106 27/32, down 26/32 from late Wednesday to yield
10.72%.
   Meanwhile, First Chicago Corp. said its First National
Bank of Chicago subsidiary lowered its prime, or base lending
rate, to 9.5% from 10%. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of
Chicago, also a First Chicago unit, was the only other bank
to follow suit. On Wednesday, several regional banks lowered
the prime rate, although no major money center bank has yet
done so.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of U.S. Treasury securities followed the European
markets yesterday, posting modest losses on news of Mr.
Shevardnadze's resignation.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 5/8 point
lower, a decline of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, rose to 8.23% from 8.17% on
Wednesday.
   Rates on Treasury bills were modestly lower. The discount
rate on three-month bills ended at 6.55% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 6.73%, down from Wednesday when the
discount rate ended at 6.59% to yield 6.77%.
   Yesterday's loss followed even sharper declines on
Wednesday, when investors sold bonds in an effort to capture
profits as the year end approaches.
   But trading activity has been light because many investors
have moved to the sidelines, where they will remain until the
new year begins.
   Market players "want no risk, and any political turmoil
that may take place outside or even in the domestic market
will have a magnified impact," said Maria Ramirez, who heads
Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   Recent declines in interest rates and news of political
strife in the Middle East and Soviet Union has prompted
investors to "assume the opportunity to take profits, to lock
in profits before they totally evaporate," said Ms. Ramirez.
At this juncture, "there's no reason to take risk."
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 point
lower. In the junk bond market, prices of speculative-grade
bonds, or securities with low credit ratings or no credit
ratings at all, finished little changed.
   There were no new issues.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended steady to 1/4 point lower.
   In ratings action, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed the
triple-B rating of the Philadelphia International Airport's
airport revenue bonds on its Credit-Watch surveillance list
with negative implications.
   According to S&amp;P, the action reflects "the city's
inability to access the note market," and possible
repercussions relating to the airport's capital funds.
   The bonds are rated B-a by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   A total of $154 million of outstanding debt is affected by
the action. Philadelphia traders report that the bonds were
unaffected by the news and continue to trade at yields in the
9% range, similar to those of the city's general obligation
bonds.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/4 lower at 98 7/8 to yield
7.27%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended with losses of 6/32 to 8/32.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
January delivery were down 8/32 at 99 5/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. Mac Gold 9% securities and Federal National
Mortgage Association 9% securities were down 6/32 at 98 29/32
and 98 21/32, respectively.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government-sponsored
thrift bailout organization, sold approximately $750 million
of mortgage securities.
   According to one Freddie Mac trader, the issues were very
well received.
   In the primary market, no new issues were announced.
