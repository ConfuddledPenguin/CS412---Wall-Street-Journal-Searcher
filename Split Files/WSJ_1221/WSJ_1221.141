   BSD Bancorp said it plans to increase its loan-loss
reserves by about $1 million, resulting in "minimal"
fourth-quarter profit.
   For the full year, the San Diego bank holding company
expects profit to be about equal to nine-month profit of $3.4
million. Fourth-quarter profit last year was $1.4 million, or
40 cents a share; full-year profit was $4 million, or $1.13 a
share.

   The company said its reserve increases include $721,000 in
commercial loan write-offs at Bank of San Diego and other
"special reserves" to provide "additional cushion for the
anticipated recessionary environment" next year.
   BSD said its three major banks, including Bank of San
Diego, recently underwent examinations by representatives of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and that "all charge-offs
directed by the regulators have been taken."
