   NEW YORK -- Ronald O. Perelman's debt-laden holdings
sustained a blow yesterday when Moody's Investor Service Inc.
downgraded the ratings of $828 million of junk bonds at two
of his companies.
   Affected was the subordinated debt of holding company
Revlon Group Inc., which was downgraded to Caa from
single-B-3. Moody's also downgraded Revlon Inc.'s senior debt
to single-B-2 from single-B-1.

   In part, the move was prompted by Revlon's lack of
financial flexibility at a time when the U.S. economy is
weakening, and competition is increasing in global beauty
care and cosmetics, according to the rating service. But
Moody's also attributed the action to the probability that
the company's debt will need to be refinanced beginning in
1992, and further access to the credit markets will be
restricted by the covenants of the company's bank loans.
   Mr. Perelman has operated Revlon with a heavy debt load
since he acquired the cosmetics maker in a hostile takeover
in 1985. A series of asset sales have reduced that debt
somewhat, although the closely held company isn't required to
report the debt of Revlon Group. Moody's said it believed
additional asset sales could result in lower margins and cut
into cash flow.
   A Revlon Group spokesman said an agreement that it made
earlier this year to restructure a $1.8 billion bank loan
required certain asset sales. He added that the company has
identified several assets, including a flavorings company and
real-estate holdings, that could be sold without reducing the
company's cash flow.
   Junk bond analysts said they weren't surprised by Moody's
action, and the prices of Revlon's bonds weren't affected by
the announcement. "Nobody is happy to see it, but it wasn't a
shock," says one high-yield analyst.
   Moody's confirmed the single-B-3 rating for the
subordinated debt of Revlon Inc., as well as the not-prime
rating for its commercial paper.
