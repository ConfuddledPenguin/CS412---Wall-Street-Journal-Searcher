   Denison Mines Ltd., facing a possible cash shortage next
month, said it was in discussions with two separate parties
interested in acquiring the uranium mining concern.
   William James, who was appointed president and chief
executive officer of Denison last week, said the talks were
at a "very preliminary" stage. Mr. James wouldn't identify
the potential buyers, but said the talks were continuing.

   "We'll talk to anybody {about acquiring Denison}. We need
the money. We're tight," he said.
   Mr. James said Denison, which has been plagued by low
uranium prices for several years, could still sell some of
its assets to raise cash. The company has been unable to sell
its overseas oil and gas assets since putting them up for
sale last year. Denison, based in Toronto, also has interests
in potash and coal mining.
   Denison must repay 150 million Canadian dollars (US$129.4
million) in bank loans next month. Mr. James said the company
is seeking an extension. Denison also faces a deadline next
March to retract C$175 million in preferred shares.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Denison Class B, nonvoting
shares closed yesterday at 70 Canadian cents, up six Canadian
cents. The Class A shares gained five Canadian cents to 75
Canadian cents.
