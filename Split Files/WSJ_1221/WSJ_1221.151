   Sales of art and antiques at Sotheby's Holdings Inc. fell
50% in the fall art-auction season from the year-earlier
period.
   The New York auction house's sales during the season,
which runs from September through mid-December, totaled $751
million, down from $1.51 billion in 1989, the company said.

   Sotheby's sales for all of 1990 totaled $2.434 billion,
compared with 1989 auction sales of $2.946 billion, a decline
of 17%.
   Michael L. Ainslie, president and chief executive, said
two important collecting categories, Impressionist and
Contemporary Art, have experienced extraordinary price
increases in recent years, "but now, affected by a worldwide
climate of political and economic uncertainty," those markets
"understandably could not maintain these levels." He added
that sales in 1990 could be seen as "the beginning of the
return to normalcy."
   London-based Christie's International PLC, Sotheby's chief
rival in the art-auction business, yesterday reported a 39%
drop in dollar terms in its fall-season sales. Both firms
have previously announced cost-cutting measures and layoffs
intended to trim 1991 costs by about 10%.
