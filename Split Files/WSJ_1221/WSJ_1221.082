   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. plan to
keep four more car and truck assembly plants idle after the
traditional holiday closings end Jan. 2, meaning that a total
of 10 U.S. assembly plants won't be working during the first
weeks of 1991.
   GM said it will idle until Jan. 14 the Detroit assembly
plant that builds recreational and special vehicle chassis
and the Flint, Mich., plant that builds Chevrolet Blazer and
GMC Jimmy sport-utility vehicles, Chevrolet and GMC Suburban
truckwagons, and crew-cab chassis. A total of 4,870 workers
will be laid off because of slow sales.

   Chrysler will temporarily halt production at two more
plants and extend the shutdown of a third to cut backlogs of
unsold vehicles. About 1,600 workers will be laid off until
Jan. 21 at Chrysler's St. Louis No. 1 plant, which builds the
Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models. The Toledo, Ohio,
plant that makes Jeep Cherokee sport-utility vehicles will be
closed until the week of Jan. 28, affecting about 4,500
employees. And Chrysler said it will extend the planned
shutdown of its Sterling Heights, Mich., subcompact car plant
for one week, until Jan. 28.
   Chrysler also said it has scheduled two shifts of overtime
tomorrow at the Windsor assembly plant that builds the Dodge
Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans. The auto maker's St.
Louis No. 2 plant, which builds larger minivan models, will
work two nine-hour shifts daily.
   Overall, the 10 U.S. auto makers plan to build a total of
90,195 cars this week, down 28% from 125,242 in the
comparable 1989 week.
