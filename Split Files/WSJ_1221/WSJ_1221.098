   The Liberal Plantation is fighting back in Kansas City.
Last month, 57% of voters passed a draconian retroactive
two-term limit on the mayor and city council. Some city
council members sued to keep their jobs on the grounds that
term limits are racist, an argument a federal judge threw out
this week. The sponsor of the initiative, black businessman
Henry Lyons, now hopes to carry the term-limit message to
other cities with large minority populations.
   Kansas City has a history of machine politics: The
whites-only Pendergast machine of the 1930s had such
efficient "ghost" voting that in one election it recorded
more votes than the number of registered voters. Today, the
minority areas of Kansas City are dominated by Freedom Inc.,
which began as part of the civil-rights movement in the
1960s, but has since become a political machine dependent on
government patronage jobs and sweetheart public contracts.

   Mr. Lyons challenged its viselike grip on the polls with a
term-limit measure that will force nine of the 13 city
council members to leave office in March. Councilmen Charles
Hazley and Robert Hernandez filed suit in federal court
charging that term limits will elect only "safe" minorities
who will not challenge the status quo. Using an argument
certain to be echoed by other officeholders, they claimed in
court that while "they are not indispensable to their
constituents, their experience is." Mr. Lyons's attorney,
Terry Brady, replied that term limits allow voters to elect
other qualified minorities or to elect a city council
incumbent to another office.
   Federal Judge Howard F. Sachs ruled that while he thought
term limits were bad public policy, they violated neither the
Constitution nor the Voting Rights Act. In court, Mr. Brady
had asked Mr. Hazley, a five-term councilman who is temporary
chairman of Freedom Inc., if Mr. Lyons was black. "To the
best of my knowledge," Mr. Hazley replied. Mr. Hernandez
answered by saying there was "some question" about Mr.
Lyons's race. After a pause he added, "He's black, he's
black. I'm just angry and nervous."
   Mr. Hazley admitted that term limits are "race neutral,"
but argued that in practice they discriminate. He said the
campaign for term limits was racially motivated, but produced
no real evidence. Indeed, he admitted that Freedom Inc. had
circulated flyers calling term limits "a racist, bossist,
plantation-style effort to destroy our community." Despite
such tactics, term limits won 44% of the vote in heavily
black areas. Nationwide, polls show blacks are likelier to
support term limits than are whites.
   Mr. Lyons says that far from being racist, term limits
will allow "other voices in the minority community to be
heard." In some cases, term limits could mean more minority
representation, since white incumbents often hold on to
districts that have changed demographically simply because of
incumbent advantages.
   Of course, none of this matters to the proprietors of the
Liberal Plantation of Kansas City. Their only response is to
cry "racism" at every turn. Their arguments instead have the
familiar ring of attempts to maintain a system of
paternalistic political power.
