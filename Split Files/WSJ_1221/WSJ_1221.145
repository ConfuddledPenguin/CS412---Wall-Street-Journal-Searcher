   CSC Industries Inc. said it has more than doubled the
number of shares outstanding, resulting in $17.5 million of
new equity and a change in the ownership structure of the
company.
   The steelmaker, based in Warren, Ohio, said it sold 11.6
million newly issues common shares for $14.5 million. Of that
total, Daido Steel Co., a principal shareholder of CSC,
purchased 5,840,000 shares, and C. Itoh &amp; Co., Marubeni
Corp., and Okaya &amp; Co., each purchased 1,920,000 shares. CSC
generated an additional $3 million of equity by converting $3
million of debt with Imetal of Paris into 2.4 million new
common shares.

outstanding to 22,744,915 from 8,744,915. It also boosts
Daido's ownership to 38.2% from 32.5% and ownership by each
of the three Japanese trading companies to 8.4%. Imetal's
ownership was reduced to 23% from 32.5%. The stake held by
remaining shareholders was reduced to 13.5% from 35%.
