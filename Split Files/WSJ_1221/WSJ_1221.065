   NEW YORK -- Moves by accounting standard-setters to keep
the public more up-to-date on the value of company assets and
debt are gaining steam.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has just proposed
requiring corporations to give current market values in
financial-statement footnotes for securities and investments,
generally starting in 1991. For companies with less than $100
million in assets, the disclosure must begin in 1992.

   Also, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a
rule-making unit of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, has just issued a rule requiring
financial institutions to show unrealized gains and losses in
their bond portfolios in financial-statement disclosures.
   Many businessmen, particularly bankers, contend that these
measures, which would cover loans, are too costly and
confusing. They say that the reports will be very difficult
to produce.
   "It's disclosure overkill," says David Locke, president of
the $300 million-asset McFarland State Bank in McFarland,
Wis. "For us to figure out the value of all our 400 loans,
many to local businessmen, would be a ludicrous exercise
hardly worth doing every year."
   Despite such complaints, the standard-setters are still
initiating such disclosure projects because of heavy pressure
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC wants
all companies and particularly financial institutions to give
more current data on assets to avoid debacles like those in
the thrift industry.
   In January, the FASB, the chief rule-making body for
accountants, plans to begin considering whether to mark to
current market prices certain securities, particularly bonds,
held by financial institutions. This project is particularly
upsetting to banks, many of which have long been trading with
their bond portfolios and using original-cost values to keep
losses down.
   Current accounting rules say that if a financial
institution is holding debt to maturity, it may hold that
debt at original cost. But if the debt is held in a trading
account, it must be marked to market, which could produce big
losses or gains when the market moves sharply.
   Pat McConnell, managing director of Bear Stearns &amp; Co.,
who writes an accounting newsletter for the securities firm,
says the efforts to force companies and banks to mark
securities and other assets to market "will bring a firestorm
of protest." She adds: "That's because some assets, such as
private placements, are very difficult to value."
   Bankers say that such disclosures for local bond issues,
loans and other bank assets can be a "nightmare." Small
bankers "are very opposed to such disclosure rules because
they're too costly and would be devastating to banks, which
already are beset with many economic problems," says Diane
Casey, executive director of the 6,200-member Independent
Bankers Association of America in Washington, D.C.
   The latest FASB proposal requiring current market value
disclosure in footnotes is set to be made a rule by the 1991
fourth quarter, after public comment, officials of the
Norwalk, Conn.-based FASB say.
