   TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it was so
concerned about U.S. reaction to its purchase of MCA Inc.
that it was prepared to end negotiations if a major political
backlash occurred.
   Masahiko Hirata, the Matsushita executive vice president
who led the company's talks with MCA, said at a news
conference that Matsushita told MCA that if anti-Japanese
sentiment "was going to become a very big issue, we weren't
going to proceed" with the negotiations.

   Mr. Hirata said Matsushita's specific plans for the U.S.
entertainment company, which it agreed last month to acquire
for about $66 a share, or about $6.59 billion, won't be
completed until the takeover is officially finalized,
probably early next month. He reiterated that a main reason
for the MCA purchase was to strengthen development of
Matsushita's high-definition television hardware.
   Matsushita has consistently maintained that it will take a
hands-off approach in managing MCA. While both companies will
form an executive committee to devise strategies, Mr. Hirata
said, only a few Matsushita employees will be transferred to
MCA's California headquarters. Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
62-year-old president, recently said the company won't
interfere with the creative independence of MCA's film
producers.

   MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL Co. had been concerned,
before completing negotiations last month, that a political
backlash in the U.S. could kill its pending acquisition of
MCA Inc. This was misstated in a headline on an article in
Friday's edition.
