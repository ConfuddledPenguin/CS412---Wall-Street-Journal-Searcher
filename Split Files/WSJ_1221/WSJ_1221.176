   NEW YORK -- Short interest was about flat on the New York
Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, as more short
sellers apparently covered their positions and more investors
relaxed.
   The figure for the Big Board for the month ended Dec. 14
edged higher from the mid-November period and totaled nearly
1% of the total shares listed on the exchange. The Amex
figure was fractionally lower and totaled about 0.8% of all
Amex-listed shares. Until this last trading month, short
interest had increased almost relentlessly, up 54% from a
year ago.

   "The loss of momentum is very interesting. Lots of shorts
must have covered," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst at
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. But he also thinks a "growing
complacency" among investors about the recent rally from the
market's low point could set them up for another market
retreat. Short positions then could take off again, he said.
   But Mr. Solomon also echoed the prevalent view about short
interest. "Everyone's agreed that we'll slough it off"
because it has lost its significance as a market indicator.
The growth of derivative products such as options and
warrants, and arbitrage, have acted as hedges on short
positions. Previously, short interest was a clearer
barometer, but with the offsetting effect of other
stock-related products, "you can't tell easily where the
smart money is," Mr. Solomon said.
   Citicorp continued with the highest individual short
volume, more than 17.1 million shares. In the previous
trading month, ended Nov. 15, its short interest shot up from
next to nothing as investors and analysts anticipated further
problems for the New York banking giant, including a cut in
the dividend. This week, Citicorp announced such a cut and
significant staff reduction.
   First Chicago Corp., another major banking company, saw
short interest soar to 12.8 million shares from only 565,651
the month before. Analysts had speculated that it also would
cut its dividend. Last month, however, it declared its
regularly quarterly dividend.
   Again following Citicorp on the Big Board list were the
Indianapolis drug company Eli Lilly &amp; Co., at 14.3 million
shares; the Stamford, Conn., telecommunications concern GTE
Corp., 13.5 million, and the Toronto holding company Varity
Corp., 12.8 million. They have been among short interest
leaders for some time.
   New York exchange short interest rose at the Dec. 14
settlement date to a record 855,767,642 shares from the
previous record 850,807,721 at mid-November. On the Amex,
short interest fell to 83,229,058 shares from an adjusted
83,535,467 shares, which was a record. The month included the
22 trading days through Dec. 7.
   At mid-December 1989, short volume was 555,872,159 shares
on the Big Board, indicating a 54% advance over 12 months,
and an adjusted 58,785,285 shares on the Amex, indicating a
41.6% rise.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been
purchased for return to lenders.
   Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 5.58 from mid-November's 5.42.
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position. Average daily New
York exchange volume for the 22 trading days was 153,286,778
shares. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio also
has weakened in value as an indicator because of hedging
strategies.
   Among bellwether issues, the Pittsburgh industrial giant
Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s short interest rose about 58%
to five million shares; Johnson &amp; Johnson, the New Brunswick,
N.J., health-care company, saw its short volume rise about
36% to nearly three million shares; and at the Armonk, N.Y.,
computer company International Business Machines Corp., the
total rose 17% to 5.5 million. NWNL Cos., a Minneapolis life
insurance concern, had short interest of nearly 2.2 million
shares; it had none the month before.
