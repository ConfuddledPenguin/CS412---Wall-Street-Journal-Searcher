   Scali, McCabe, Sloves, reeling from the loss of the Volvo
account and other client defections, named Patrick Fallon
vice chairman.
   The Minneapolis ad executive thus inherits the daunting
challenge of restoring the agency's tarnished reputation and
luring new clients to its flagship New York office. Mr.
Fallon, 45 years old, will continue as chairman of Fallon
McElligott, the Minneapolis shop that is majority owned by
Scali. But he will move to New York, assuming the role of top
account executive for the New York and Canada offices from
Marvin Sloves, the firm's chairman and chief executive.

   Mr. Sloves, for his part, said he will now focus on
securing a deal to remove his agency from WPP Group, which
assumed control of Scali in 1989. Although WPP Chief Martin
Sorrell has said publicly that he would allow Scali to buy
itself back, negotiations have stalled repeatedly over
financing details. A newly formed board of directors, staffed
by executives at Scali and some of its U.S. units, is
expected to help get a buy-out completed.
   The decision to bring in Mr. Fallon, co-founder of one of
the hottest creative agencies of the 1980s, as leader of
Scali's rescue mission follows a disastrous year at Scali. By
far the most damaging loss was the $40 million Volvo account,
resigned after it was revealed a Scali-created ad was rigged.
(Scali executives have said they didn't do anything wrong.)
Since then, executives at the company and its U.S.
subsidiaries have had extensive discussions behind closed
doors to determine just what to do next.
   "What New York needs is someone to work with Sam {Scali}
and give the office some fresh perspective," Mr. Sloves said.
"We've all decided that Pat is the guy for the job. We're
going to give him the real authority to do whatever it takes
to make this the great vibrant agency it was a year ago."
(Mr. Scali is the agency's world-wide creative director.)
   That won't be easy. Billings at Scali's New York office
have dropped to about $200 million from $280 million two
years ago, with account losses such as Lotus Development and
Toys "R" Us. The shop also lost Nikon's $12 million account
after the agency inadvertently ran magazine ads for a new
camera before Nikon was able to introduce it to dealers.
   Mr. Sloves stressed, however, that the problems are
limited to the New York office and noted that the other ad
agencies in Scali's self-named "confederation" are healthy.
He noted, for example, that the agency in Mexico doubled its
billings this year and billings in France have grown 50%.
   One of Mr. Fallon's first moves will be to bring in a
big-name creative executive to lead the New York office and
work with Mr. Scali. That person will succeed Bob Levenson,
who will retire at the end of the year. Mr. Fallon said he
believes he will be able to make the moves necessary to put
the agency back on its feet. "I have a record of making tough
decisions and not being equivocal once they're made," he
said.
   Mr. Fallon insisted Fallon McElligott, known for its
clever ads for Rolling Stone magazine and Porsche, can
operate sufficiently with him on a part-time basis, saying
there is other strong management in place. Steven Sjoblad,
for example, has been president of the agency for four years,
he said. Furthermore, Mr. Fallon said he hopes to spend more
time in Minneapolis when a turnaround at Scali materializes.
"I'm not going to abandon Minneapolis," he said.
"Emotionally, I'm not capable of doing that."
   Still, questions remain as to whether taking Mr. Fallon
away from his agency to help save Scali is a smart move.
Fallon McElligott itself suffered a public-relations
nightmare three years ago and has just recently stabilized.
In that instance, the press got hold of some smart-aleck
responses the agency sent to a woman who accused it of
creating a sexist ad for the TV show "Dynasty." Mr. Fallon
said that incident has given him "some experience dealing
with unsettling situations."
   Meanwhile, a Federal Trade Commission investigation of the
Volvo ad continues. The ad showed a pickup truck driving over
the top of a row of cars, crushing the roofs of every one
except the Volvo. The Volvo, though, had a roof reinforced
with lumber and steel and the Texas Attorney General charged
that the pillars of the other cars in the commercial were
severed or weakened.
   Yesterday, Mr. Sloves sent letters -- approved by his
lawyers after the agency's own investigation -- to clients
and agency partners absolving Scali from any wrongdoing. "No
one from Scali, McCabe, Sloves gave instructions for or
authorized any alteration to any car . . . the evidence on
that point is clear," Mr. Sloves wrote.
   Mr. Sloves said that while working out a buy-back
agreement with Mr. Sorrell is his No. 1 priority, he is also
eager to begin further development on the shop's
international network. "Here we are on Dec. 20, and we are
still 80%-owned by Martin Sorrell," Mr. Sloves said. "Action
is required."

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Loehmann's named Wells, Rich, Greene to
handle its $5 million account. Lord, Geller, Federico,
Einstein, the WPP Group agency now known as Brouillard/LGFE,
formerly had the New York-based discount retailer's account.
. . . Digital Equipment picked Mullen of Wenham, Mass., to
create ads for its computer-integrated manufacturing
business. Billings couldn't be determined. The Maynard,
Mass., computer maker continues to work with two other
agencies for other divisions. . . . Outboard Marine,
Waukegan, Ill., awarded accounts for two of its outboard
motor lines, Johnson and Evinrude, to Messner Vetere Berger
Carey Schmetterer, New York. Billings weren't disclosed. The
accounts were handled by Hoffmann York &amp; Compton, Milwaukee,
which continues to handle other Outboard Marine lines. . . .
As expected, Los Angeles footwear marketer L.A. Gear formally
named BBDO's Los Angeles as outside ad agency. BBDO, an
Omnicom Group unit, will do creative work in conjunction with
the company's in-house agency.
