   TOKYO -- General Electric Co. won an important competition
over rival Pratt &amp; Whitney Co. to design the engine for
Japan's controversial FSX fighter plane.
   The decision, expected to be announced by the Japan
Defense Agency today, ends a three-year battle between the
world's two leading aircraft-engine makers for a share of the
high-profile project. As the U.S. government scales back on
arms allocations, the stakes are growing for U.S. companies
for such military spending overseas.

   The immediate concrete benefits to GE are small. The
company has a commitment only to sell as many as seven
prototype engines, with a likely total value of about $25
million. But the design work almost certainly gives GE a hand
in subsequent engine production for the full project,
currently planned at 100 to 130 planes, and valued at a
minimum of $100 million for the engine maker.
   Both companies also have wagered that the bragging rights
from a highly publicized victory in Japan could help tip
similar decisions in other countries, such as Egypt, Israel,
Turkey and Greece. "Japan's wisdom in these matters is held
in high regard, and the decision could influence similar
decisions in other major international markets," Robert F.
Daniell, chief executive of Pratt &amp; Whitney's parent,
Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., said last
month at a Tokyo news conference.
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., confirmed it had won the
contract but declined to comment further, pending Japan's
formal announcement.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney said it was "very disappointed" to hear of
the Japanese government's decision. William C. Missimer,
president of the company's government engine business, said,
"We firmly believe the choice is not a reflection on the
technical merits and operational superiority of the PW-229
engine." Despite this setback, Pratt &amp; Whitney said the
international sales potential of its F100-PW-229 fighter
plane is expected to remain strong.
   The FSX, Japan's next-generation fighter, has been
controversial since its inception. The plane is being
co-developed by the U.S. and Japan, and American critics have
alleged that U.S. aircraft companies participating will be
helping Japan catch up in one of the few industrial sectors
where it still lags far behind the U.S.
   Regarding the engine contract as well, critics have
suggested that the U.S. will inevitably end up teaching
potential Japanese competitors how to take on GE and Pratt &amp;
Whitney. Once production starts in the mid to late 1990s, GE
will license engine technology to one of Japan's three major
aircraft companies, yet to be selected, and build the engine
with that Japanese company. The details of exactly how much
GE will make and how much it will license haven't yet been
worked out.
   Defenders of the agreement have countered that GE will
have an even more advanced engine in production in the U.S.
by the time it starts sharing technology for the FSX engine.
   The main U.S. contractor for the project is St.
Louis-based General Dynamics Corp., whose F-16 is the basic
model for the FSX. General Dynamics has been co-designing the
plane with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. since April, but
the two companies have had to wait for an engine selection to
complete part of their work.
   After surviving the political flap in the U.S. Congress
over technology-sharing, the FSX is now caught in a crunch in
the Japanese Diet over cost overruns. The Japan Defense
Agency recently said the total project cost is likely to run
more than 40% higher than initially thought, and is currently
asking the Japanese Diet for more money. Some industry
analysts think the project may be scaled back.
   Still, the win is important for GE in its continuing
competition with Pratt &amp; Whitney. The two companies together
account for two-thirds of all military-engine sales in the
world, and while they were about equal in the early 1980s, GE
says it has pulled to a commanding lead, with 42% of the
world market share against 25% for Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   For many years, Pratt &amp; Whitney has been supplying engines
for the made-in-Japan version of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s
F-15 fighter.
