   LONDON -- Beyond the recent rhetoric, the European
Community looks less like an international trade bloc than a
block to international trade.
   With Europe's magic 1992 date for unity about to draw
another year closer, this is the time when steps towards a
liberated, open marketplace of 320 million consumers should
be increasingly apparent. In Rome recently, the heads of the
EC's 12 national governments looked beyond reality to an even
more lofty and distant goal for the future: creating a
bustling political federation with a single currency and
monetary policy.

   But the EC's actions have been counter to the
freer-markets and deregulation goals at the nucleus of the
1992 project. This unfortunate development is the source of
increasing worry for thousands of companies -- especially
American and Japanese multinationals -- that hope to expand
in an increasingly open Europe.
   As the politicians embellish lofty visions, Europe slipped
backward into old habits of increasing state control of the
economy, clubbish cronyism and egotistical self-obsession.
   Several recent business examples highlight the trend. They
come against the backdrop of the recent failure of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to make important
changes that would have further reduced commercial barriers
in over 100 countries.
   The EC caused the breakdown by insisting on protecting its
farmers and failing to grapple with its money-losing -- and
eventually unaffordable -- state subsidies for agriculture.
   The stakes resulting from such indifference run high.
Carla Hills, U.S. trade representative, told a conference of
American state legislators that the kind of global
cooperation shown in the Persian Gulf crisis might not be
possible in the future.
   Many of Europe's savviest businessmen realize that this
protectionist bent -- if continued -- could boomerang and
jeopardize Europe's unprecedented post-World War II economic
prosperity as well.
   Consider Air France's ability to acquire control of 97% of
the domestic airline market, apparently proving that
monopolies are going to fly high in the friendly skies of the
new Europe. Earlier this year, the state-owned French airline
agreed to buy its main private-sector competitor L'Union des
Transports Aeriens. The deal also gave Air France control of
the nation's main domestic carrier, UTA's 36%-owned Air Inter
unit.
   One might think that Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's antitrust
commissioner, would scupper such a flagrant violation of EC
rules, ensuring more-open access to markets. He tried -- sort
of. Though some EC commissioners agreed the Air France
transaction appeared to run counter to EC antitrust rules,
Air France has managed to get its way in return for some
promised route concessions.
   Why? Because in Europe, what counts isn't what you say to
but whom you know. In Air France's case, political power
trumped liberal economic principles. Air France's chairman is
Bernard Attali, brother of trusted Mitterrand government
adviser Jacques -- himself the head of the new Bank for
European Reconstruction &amp; Development. And EC Commission
President Jacques Delors, whom many believe hopes to become
France's next president, also backed the deal.
   Italy is increasing state control of the economy and
industry. And thus far, anyway, Brussels doesn't seem to have
raised a peep of protest.
   Last month, the government acquired control of chemical
giant Enimont S.p.A. for an estimated $2.7 billion from its
private-sector owners -- thus increasing the state's
already-important role in industry. For an EC that's supposed
to be concerned about state subsidies, its inability to do
anything in the Enimont saga is a cautionary tale.
   Enimont was supposed to marry the public-sector muscle of
state-owned energy company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi and the
private-sector entrepreneurship of high-flying businessman
Raul Gardini, head of the Ferruzzi financial and agriculture
empire. Instead, the venture quickly fell apart in a dispute
over goals and tactics.
   Mr. Gardini accepted the Italian government's offer to buy
his 40% stake. The deal leaves the Italian government less
likely to succeed in its plan to create a fast-footed
national chemicals champion able to compete in the global
market.
   As a result of such situations, London stockbrokers UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew expect Italy to fall short of its
once-upon-a-time target of six trillion lira in
privatizations this year and next.
   Also last month, the EC Commission -- despite Sir Leon's
objections -- cleared the merger of two big Dutch coffee
makers. The decision exposes the biggest loophole in
Brussels' merger-control plans: National governments can
still trump the EC when they feel their so-called national
interest at stake.
   For the Dutch, coffee is the national interest. At issue
was Douwe Egberts, a Sara Lee unit, combination with rival
Van Nelle, which gave the firms 70% of the Benelux coffee
market. Never mind, the EC commissioners from Holland and
Belgium argued when the EC Commission initially objected to
the deal: This matters primarily in our home markets, and our
local arbiters should decide. Though the market is small, the
decision underscored the fact that politics, not economics,
at times is running the merger-control process. That raises
some worrying questions in the minds of EC merger
practitioners.
   Such examples may be just a taste of what's to come. For
example, the European auto industry -- pushed largely by such
firms as Peugeot -- seems headed for further restrictions of
Japanese competition through voluntary quotas. And would
Airbus Industrie be such an increasingly potent commercial
rival to Boeing Co. if its heavy government subsidies were
suddenly stopped?
   But initial enthusiasm is giving way to dangerous habits.
Unless Europe takes its head out of the clouds, and puts its
feet on the ground it is on the road to becoming a fortress
to block trade, instead of a trade bloc.
