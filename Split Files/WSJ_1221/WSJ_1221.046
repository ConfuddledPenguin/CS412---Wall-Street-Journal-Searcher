   The Orlando switchboard lit up with season-ticket orders.
Miami redoubled efforts on stadium renovations. Denver was
flooded with resumes for front-office jobs. And Tampa Bay,
Buffalo and Washington went equally nuts this week over the
prospect of getting one of the two worst teams in baseball.
   The six cities were named finalists for the National
League's first expansion in more than 20 years. The two
winners will be picked by next September and begin play in
1993. The contest will be as heated as a pennant race because
it carries World Series-sized stakes: for aspiring cities,
the chance to be called Big League; for would-be owners, the
chance to join the inner circle of the national pastime.

   The quest has already been long and arduous -- Tampa Bay's
dating back 13 years -- but the intensity now ratchets up a
notch. Miami's owner laid plans for a name-the-team contest,
a season-ticket drive and other shows of fan support. Buffalo
will invite National League owners to see its rabid sports
fans at a Bills football playoff game. Washington is looking
for a heavy-hitter to both bolster and burnish its ownership
group. Said the group's leader, John Akridge: "I'm out
looking for a zillionaire."
   Indeed, while the expansion game plays out on many levels
-- market comparisons, political maneuverings, civic
implorings -- above all it is about money. Large sums of
money. When baseball last expanded in 1977, the American
League entry fee was $7 million; now it's $95 million. That
year, the average player salary was $76,000; now it's about
$600,000. In the late 1970s, baseball was a cozy little $300
million industry; today, its revenues top $1.2 billion.
   At one level, the $190 million infusion of franchise fees
is a life buoy to keep the incumbent owners' heads above
water. Though baseball turned a $214 million pretax operating
profit in 1989, salaries are spiraling upward fast and teams
in smaller markets are struggling. And every team has been
jolted by a collusion ruling against baseball's owners that
cost each of them $10.8 million. The expansion fees, divvied
among the 12 existing National League teams, replenish
coffers by $15.8 million apiece. The incumbents do have to
provide players to the expansion teams, but only the dregs of
their rosters.
   It's such a great deal, in fact, that the American League
is deeply jealous. After the four-member expansion committee,
composed of three current owners and National League
President Bill White, makes its recommendations, new teams
must be approved by nine of the National League's 12 owners
and a majority of the American League's 14 owners. American
League owners are demanding a cut of the franchise fees. The
National League is adamantly opposed. If the issue is not
peacefully resolved by Commissioner Fay Vincent, the American
League could eventually act as a spoiler, using its veto
power to block the National League from where it would most
like to go.
   That, clearly, is Florida. Quite beyond short-term
self-interest, baseball has long-term strategic reasons for
expansion. By adding big markets, it can build national TV
ratings. By entering virgin baseball territory, it can expand
its fan base. And if it expands into booming areas, there's
lots of potential for attendance growth. Florida is all of
those. It's the fourth most populous state, the third fastest
growing -- and it has no big-league team. California has
five.
   Florida has one entry, Tampa Bay, that is the nation's
13th largest media market. It has another, Miami, that could
be a great export market for baseball to Latin America. It
has a third, Orlando, that's the fastest growing city in
America. The only real question is whether the National
League will put one of its two new teams in Florida -- or
both. The answer may depend on how the American League
dispute plays out; it may depend on whether the National
League wants more geographic diversity; and it may depend on
whether baseball fears political trouble on Capitol Hill if
one state gets all the action.
   If Florida doesn't make a clean sweep, either Denver or
Washington is likely to get the second team. Denver positions
itself as another virgin-territory candidate, opening up
baseball to a whole swath of the country without it. If only
more people lived there. Washington, D.C., positions itself
as the demographics candidate: ninth largest U.S.
metropolitan area, seventh largest media market, biggest city
without a big-league team -- not to mention home to a lot of
members of Congress who like baseball. If only it weren't so
near Baltimore, the Orioles' home 40 miles away.
   For, above all, baseball doesn't want to cannibalize
present teams' markets. That violates good marketing
principles. More important, it violates present owners'
sensibilities. Indianapolis was an early expansion hopeful,
even mounting a drive that sold 11,000 season tickets. But it
is only about 100 miles from Cincinnati. The drive died when
Reds owner Marge Schott, asked about the city's chances,
replied, "Over my dead body."
   That's also what makes Buffalo a long-shot candidate,
though it made the short list. It's so close to Toronto,
Cleveland and Pittsburgh that some were stunned it got this
far. The cannibal factor definitely contributed to sinking
Sacramento (near the two Bay Area teams), Charlotte (Atlanta)
and Nashville (nestled among Atlanta, Cincinnati and St.
Louis).
   Buffalo is also a place that would look better under
baseball's old economics. It could count on huge fan support.
The Buffalo Bisons have set minor-league attendance records
by drawing more than a million fans each of the past three
seasons. But gate receipts mean a lot less than they used to.
A big local TV deal is essential. Any Florida team would
start out with the advantage of a big market. It could figure
on at least an $8 million a year broadcast deal, or more than
double some existing contracts. Buffalo, only the nation's
38th biggest media market, would be disadvantaged.
   The National League not only wants viable markets but,
more than ever, certainty that the new owners can play this
costly game. It's in National League owners' interest to add
strong teams, even if that means an irksome new competitor
for free agents or pennants. Unlike many other industries,
baseball is only as strong as its weakest links. "If they
`competed' one of the Big Three automakers out of business,
the others wouldn't cry," says former Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn. "But if a team goes out of business in baseball, you've
busted up your league."
   Baseball prefers local owners, who won't be tempted to
move to another city -- and make a mess for baseball -- if
the going gets rough. But that's clearly a secondary
consideration, considering the finalist selection of a Tampa
Bay group bankrolled by non-locals, an Orlando group headed
by Michigan resident and Amway billionaire Richard DeVos and
a Denver group headed by a Youngstown beverage distributor.
Baseball is mostly looking for rich owners; it allows just
40% of a team's purchase price to be financed. The central
question, in expansion parlance, has become, "Can he write
the check?"
   The economy forced several once-aspiring owners to pocket
their pens. The baseball economy, moreover, is ever more
scary to expansion owners. Since the end of the season, teams
have lavished more than $230 million on free agents. That
accelerates the salary spiral, even as CBS's $170 million
write-off of baseball losses portends a skimpier national TV
deal in the future. In an open letter to Buffalo fans last
week, owner candidate Bob Rich Jr. warned that the trends may
make baseball unaffordable there. "We do not believe in
baseball at any cost," he said.
   Making money isn't the sole consideration, of course. Some
are in this for civic pride. "It's a labor of love, although
$100 million is a lot of love," says Mr. Akridge. Some are
drawn by the limelight. "There's a lot of ego in it," says
Abel Holtz, a banker in Miami who led an unsuccessful
ownership group there. Some are rabid baseball fans. While at
a Dodger fantasy camp last year, cousins S. Joel Schur and
Stephen Porter got a lead on buying a minor-league St.
Petersburg team. Hooked on running that, they went after the
Tampa Bay franchise. But, says Mr. Porter, "We made a
decision: If this didn't make economic sense, we wouldn't do
it."
   Baseball does make economic sense as a
capital-appreciation play. One expansion team, the Seattle
Mariners, was bought for a fee of $7 million in 1977, sold
for $13.1 million in 1981 and for $77 million in 1990.
Another, the New York Mets, was bought for $3.75 million in
1962, sold for $26 million in 1980 and for $100 million in
1986.
   For cities, the upside is even greater. Denver figures a
team would generate about $93 million a year for the local
economy. The indirect benefits are far greater. "A big-league
team will bring big-league companies," says Thomas Ferguson,
president of the Beacon Council, a private
economic-development group in Miami. "When companies choose
where to expand operations, they consider baseball and
football as amenities that attract people."
   That's why, when Denver's original owner dropped out,
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer personally scrambled around to
assemble a new investor group. It's why Denver and Orlando
have committed to building stadiums, at $100 million-plus a
pop, if they get teams. It's why Washington has committed $25
million to renovate RFK Stadium. It's why St. Petersburg and
the county it's in spent $110 million building a domed
stadium on speculation to compete for a franchise under the
Tampa Bay banner.
   It's also why there's a Senate task force on expansion,
used by senators to pressure baseball into giving their
constituents teams. Its chairman, Democratic Sen. Tim Wirth
of Colorado, has helped keep Denver's hopes alive. Florida's
Republican Sen. Connie Mack has one of baseball's great
names, as grandson of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics
owner, and has helped the Florida cause. The implicit threat:
Congress could repeal baseball's antitrust exemption if
baseball doesn't expand quickly and in the right places.
   That's just one level of the expansion game, which also
involves back-room politicking, back-alley-style jabbing and
slick marketing. Orlando's video presentation to the National
League was produced by the local Disney studio. Miami owner
candidate H. Wayne Huizenga poured about $500,000 into his
presentation, including leather-bound fact books, Tiffany
paperweight gifts and a slick ode-to-South-Florida video. Mr.
Huizenga has some advantages in that medium as chairman of
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
   He also has the advantage of having Pittsburgh Pirates
President Carl Barger on Blockbuster's board and Beacon
Council Chairman Jeb Bush in the Miami corner. Mr. Bush is
the brother of Texas Rangers general partner George W. Bush,
who is the son of the other George Bush. This is the contacts
level of the game, played widely and aggressively. The Tampa
Bay group includes developers Sidney and Allen Kohl,
Wisconsin natives who are close to Milwaukee Brewers owner
Bud Selig, who is close to New York Mets co-owner Fred
Wilpon, who sits on the expansion committee.
   Not that it's always an advantage to be a known quantity.
Larry Schmittou, the leader of Nashville's group, helped
scuttle his slim chances during a recent dispute between the
majors and minors. Mr. Schmittou, who runs two minor league
teams, was a vociferous member of the minors' negotiating
committee.
   Since the National League also is an exclusive club,
personal comportment could be decisive in a close contest.
This is sometimes known as "the O'Malley factor," to wit: Can
the applicant be envisioned at the same table as Peter
O'Malley, the powerful, imposing owner of the Los Angeles
Dodgers?
   Even so, the battle could feature some aspects that would
make Mr. O'Malley blush. Orlando may have offered a preview
when its minor-league team held a "St. Petersburg Night" last
August.
   This "salute" to its expansion competitor included free
admission for people over 60, a cane-throwing contest and
Cream of Wheat and Geritol at the concession stands. Explains
the team president and Orlando expansion chief, Pat Williams:
"I was just trying to bring some life to a town that's so
dull the roosters sleep till noon."
