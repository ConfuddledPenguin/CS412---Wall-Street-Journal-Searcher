   Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd. said net income for the six
months ended Sept. 30 tumbled 27% to 54 million Hong Kong
dollars (US$6.9 million) from HK$74 million a year earlier.
   For the period, the film and property group controlled by
Sir Run Run Shaw had a write-down of HK$34 million on its
investment in Hong Kong Cable Communications Ltd., the local
cable-TV franchise that was abandoned last month by its five
partners.

   Excluding the write-down, the company said profit climbed
19% to HK$88 million. Earnings per share dropped to 13.62
Hong Kong cents a share from 18.46 Hong Kong cents a share,
while revenue grew 8.7% to HK$100 million from HK$92 million.
   Group directors proposed an interim dividend of seven
cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier.
   Shaw Brothers attributed the growth in operating profit to
an increased contribution from its Singapore property arm,
following the renovation of a commercial building it owns
there.
