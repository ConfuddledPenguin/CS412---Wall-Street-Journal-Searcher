   OTTAWA -- Canadian steel production totaled 217,218 metric
tons in the week ended Dec. 15, up 12% from 194,333 tons the
previous week but a 14% decline from 253,443 tons a year
earlier, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds. From Jan. 1
through Dec. 15, production totaled 11,639,297 tons, a 21%
decline from 14,799,778 tons a year earlier. The production
decline resulted from steel-plant strikes and Canada's
economic slowdown.
