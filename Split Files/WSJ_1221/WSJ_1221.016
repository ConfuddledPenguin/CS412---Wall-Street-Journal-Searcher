   SHEVARDNADZE RESIGNED as foreign minister of the Soviet
Union.
   In an emotional speech to Soviet legislators, Shevardnadze
denounced the political right wing and warned of a new
dictatorship taking shape. His departure deprives Gorbachev
of one of his closest and most liberal allies and dashes the
president's hopes of quickly forging a consensus to deal with
the nation's social and economic crisis.

   Shevardnadze had played a crucial role in helping to end
the Cold War and to establish a cooperative relationship with
the U.S. In his speech yesterday, he attacked attempts by
some deputies at the congress to forbid the sending of Soviet
troops to the Persian Gulf.
   Despite the gloating of hard-liners, most Soviet lawmakers
were dismayed by the resignation. Some said they believe the
nation is at a crossroads, with Gorbachev's restructuring
policy, and perhaps even his own job, at stake.

   The White House budget office wants to pare Medicare
spending next fiscal year by nearly $3 billion beyond the
cuts stipulated in this fall's deficit-reduction accord with
Congress. The new cuts would result from reducing
reimbursements to hospitals and doctors, not from making
beneficiaries pay more, officials said.

   The Pentagon warned Saddam Hussein that U.S. air power
would be effective against Iraq even if ground forces weren't
ready for all-out war by the U.N. deadline of Jan. 15. In
Baghdad, officials prepared to evacuate a million people
today to an unspecified area outside the capital as part of a
massive civil-defense exercise.

   Two research groups found that inheriting specific, but
different, genes makes some women prone to breast cancer. The
studies buttress the belief that women born with one of
several genes are vulnerable. Scientists said the genes are
probably linked to non-inherited cancers occurring when the
genes are damaged.

   The U.S. joined in supporting a unanimous Security Council
resolution that deplored Israel's deportation of Palestinians
and urged U.N. monitoring of their safety. However,
Washington was successful in preventing any reference in the
resolution to a proposed Mideast peace conference, which is
supported by many Arab states.

   USX agreed to pay fines of $3.3 million to settle charges
of workplace health and safety violations at a steel mill and
a coke works, both located in Pennsylvania. The settlement
was the largest in the history of OSHA, exceeding the $1.6
million that Chrysler agreed to pay in April 1988.

   Germany's new Parliament convened, marking the first time
in 57 years that a pan-German legislative body has met. The
lawmakers, who were elected Dec. 2, held their inaugural
session in Berlin but will return to Bonn for subsequent
meetings. They eventually are expected to decide whether to
move permanently to Berlin.

   Polish President-elect Walesa asked Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
caretaker cabinet to stay on after failing to find a
candidate to form a new government. The ex-Solidarity union
leader's preferred candidate for premier, Jan Olszewski, gave
up attempts to organize a government Tuesday, citing policy
differences with Walesa.

   Lebanon's President Hrawi chose Omar Karami, the country's
education minister, to be the nation's new prime minister,
succeeding Salim Hoss, who resigned Wednesday. Three militia
groups, however, expressed doubts that Karami would be
capable of forming a government that could effectively end 15
years of civil war.

   The Bulgarian Parliament approved the country's first
multiparty government in 40 years, but former Communists --
renamed Socialists -- retained a dominant position. The
agreement on a ruling coalition, the fourth since Todor
Zhivkov was toppled in November 1989, could enable Bulgaria
to receive a standby credit from the IMF.

   Japan's cabinet passed a five-year, $171 billion defense
plan calling for Tokyo to bear more of the cost of basing
50,000 U.S. soldiers in Japan. The government slashed overall
spending growth in the new defense budget to 3% annually from
the more than 5% over the past five years.

   A study of young children found that physical abuse in the
home is more strongly linked to later aggressive behavior
than are such factors as poverty, divorce or marital
violence. The study is to be published today in the journal
Science.

   A Moslem was chosen to be the first non-Communist
president of the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
since World War II. The republic's collective presidency
selected Alija Izetbegovic three weeks after the Communists
were ousted in elections.
