   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said it will take a
charge of about $450 million against fourth-quarter earnings
and post a loss for the year because of a regulatory ruling
yesterday affecting a failed nuclear power plant.
   Analysts said the charge had been expected, in light of
actions by the Michigan Public Service Commission. In the
first nine months of 1990, CMS earned $145 million, or $1.78
a share. In 1989, net income was $312 million, or $3.80 a
share.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
CMS jumped $1.75 to closed at $27 a share.
   CMS announced the charge after an administrative law judge
for Michigan's Public Service Commission proposed yesterday
that CMS Energy be allowed to recoup $1.34 billion of the
$2.14 billion it hasn't recovered from its abandoned nuclear
plant in Midland, Mich. CMS had asked for rate increases that
would allow it to recover the full $2.14 billion.
   The judge's recommendation won't become final until the
full commission issues a final order, which is expected in
the latter half of next year. But CMS opted to take a charge
now, based on the judge's recommendation.
   CMS's Consumer's Power Co. utility abandoned its effort to
build the Midland nuclear plant in 1984 after spending $4.1
billion. The ruling relates to the amount CMS hasn't
recovered after converting part of the plant to a gas-fired
cogeneration facility.
   The recommended recovery would occur over a 10-year period
and would provide the company an annual electric rate
increase of $111.5 million during that time.
   CMS is still in litigation over the amount it may recover
through electric rates for the costs of the cogeneration
facility that began operation in March.
