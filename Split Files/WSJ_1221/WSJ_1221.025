   WASHINGTON -- Is working for the federal government
becoming fashionable again? Or does it just beat not working
at all?
   As brokerage houses and Wall Street-related law firms
suffer through a recession that has seen 50,000 firings,
federal financial agencies are finding droves of
high-powered, would-be staffers knocking at their doors.

   "You wouldn't believe all the applications we're getting,"
marvels Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, which regulates the savings-and-loan industry.
   At the Securities and Exchange Commission, applications by
attorneys jumped 50% in the most recent fiscal year, to
2,400. At the Justice Department, the number of top
law-school applicants to the agency's "honors" program has
jumped 30% since last year. (About 6% of the nearly 3,000
student applicants will be hired.) Applications are up 44% in
the antitrust division, 47% in the environmental unit and a
whopping 72% in the criminal division.
   Moreover, say federal officials, the qualifications of
those applicants are on the rise too. "You used to see a lot
of people two, three or four years out {of law school}
willing to make a switch," says Gary Sundick, who screens
resumes for the SEC's enforcement unit. "Now you're seeing
people six, seven, eight years out. We're seeing a lot of
very senior associate types who are clearly willing to make a
switch."
   The current business climate is certainly a major factor.
Many applicants, officials say, fall into the category of
"yuppie" Wall Streeters -- traders, lawyers, accountants and
others -- who lived the high life in the 1980s but are now
deciding that the stability of a humble five-figure
government salary beats battling thousands of their brethren
in the shrunken private sector.
   But some also suggest that a change in the political
climate may also be contributing to the upsurge. No one is
confusing the current era with the "ask what you can do for
your country" Kennedy administration, but federal officials
say the Reagan era's hostility toward government regulation
has diminished substantially.
   Under George Bush, "to a certain degree, we are viewed
less as being the problem," says William McLucas, the SEC's
enforcement director. "It probably relates to the fact that
the guy in the White House has held a number of jobs in the
government."
   The influx of new people, he adds, is allowing the agency
to be choosier about whom it hires, boosting the overall
quality of its work force. "Now there is the perception that
there are a lot of good, bright people in the system -- not
just shuffling papers but really working hard to solve
problems," he says.
   Christopher Berlew, a 33-year-old attorney with the SEC,
says the '80s excesses of such figures as convicted insider
trader Ivan Boesky "ticked off" him and many others. "It just
bothered me that all these people who had phenomenal amounts
of money would willingly and consciously break the law to
make more money," he says. So last year he traded in his
$79,000 income as an associate at a large Boston firm and
headed for Washington and its $45,000 offer.
   Mr. Berlew's colleague, Michael Dashjian, also 33, shares
the sentiment. "I felt I wasn't really getting any emotional
satisfaction" at his former Connecticut law firm. "I loved
the firm; they were great people. But it didn't satisfy me. I
felt I was spinning my wheels."
   While much of the government is feeling the effects of
budget austerity, the financial-regulatory crises are
providing an expanding opportunity. At the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the slowdown in financial services is
allowing the agency to fill hundreds of vacant spots.
   "Candidates sometimes indicate that the demand {in the
private sector} for their services isn't high," says Alfred
Byrne, the banking agency's general counsel, who adds he
often receives as many as 150 resumes a day. But he thinks
the interest stems more from professionals' desire to resolve
the messy problems of the banking industry. "Frankly, we
think we're where the action is." The FDIC, he adds, will be
boosting its legal staff by 50% next year, to 1,500 lawyers.
   Gerri Rigby, a 38-year-old Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. veteran, is
running a program for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency
charged with taking over failed thrifts and selling them off.
In 15 years at the big brokerage house, Ms. Rigby handled a
host of senior trading positions, dealing in specialized,
esoteric products for corporate clients. In her last job, as
an executive director of Merrill Lynch International, she set
up and ran a major trading desk in Tokyo.
   But she says she burned out from the frequent 20-hour days
and wondered what she would do next. When Merrill offered her
a New York assignment, she turned it down, doubting that she
would be challenged enough and worrying about the fragile
state of jobs on Wall Street. "As firms consolidated, I
didn't want to have to go back to fight for a position of
seniority," she recalls. She toyed with the idea of opening
her own investment firm, but fretted about the hours and the
economy in the period after the crash of 1987.
   So after a year off -- spent in part tanning on the Jersey
Shore -- Ms. Rigby got a call from an RTC official -- former
Merrill colleague Elisabeth Spector -- who was looking for
experienced Wall Streeters to run the sale of assets. Ms.
Rigby, enticed by the challenge, now heads a group selling
debt and other assets of thrifts taken over by the federal
government. Her aides on the project are also Wall Street
veterans, savvy in the ways of trading desks, bid-and-asked
spreads and the like.
   In addition to the flood of new applicants, federal
officials say departure rates are declining. The SEC, for
instance, currently projects that the turnover rate in fiscal
1991 will decline to 13.5% from 14.2% last fiscal year and
14.7% the year before. The trend greatly increases output,
because new workers generally don't provide much value to
agencies for the first year or so.
   Despite the flood of new applicants and the lengthening
tenure of existing jobholders, most lawyers and others still
seem to view the government as only a temporary career
stopover -- a place to face a challenge, gain experience or
make a contribution, and then move on. "Once the assets go
away, we will all go back to the private sector in one form
or another," says the RTC's Ms. Rigby. "There should be a
heck of a market out there for people who do a good job at
the RTC."
