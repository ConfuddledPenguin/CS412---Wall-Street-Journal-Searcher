   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rose despite the
uncertainty of Soviet politics to post yet another gain.
   The advance represented a reversal from a rapid morning
fall. Traders took stock prices sharply lower in the first
hour on worries about how the resignation of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would affect international
relations.

   The resignation of the widely respected minister cast
additional concern into a world searching for new order while
the communist empire dismantles and new allies assemble to
oppose Iraq.
   The Nasdaq composite index was more than 2 points lower as
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26 points at the
opening. But before that upset could translate into a broad
retreat, buyers came into the market and slowly took prices
higher.
   When the day was done, the Nasdaq composite index gained
1.08 points, or 0.29%, to close at 372.30. The New York Stock
Exchange composite index was down just 0.03 point to 180.32.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.73 points to close

   Opposite forces had their turn with the market yesterday.
Traders looking for a correction took the market lower while
institutions looking to upgrade their portfolios brought it
back up.
   "Traders are generally looking for a little correction on
the downside. It doesn't seem to be happening," said Ron
Catalano, executive vice president for trading at Prescott
Ball &amp; Turben.
   The Shevardnadze news prompted those anticipating a
correction to mark down prices.
   "We're at the high end of a trading range, and everybody's
a little gun shy," Mr. Catalano said.
   Lower prices, however, enticed many institutions looking
to improve their portfolios before year end to start buying,
said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham.
   Mr. Constanza said the institutions confined their
shopping primarily to larger issues. Among the institutional
targets were Apple Computer, up 2 1/8 to 44, and Intel, up 1
1/4 to 39.
   In the broader market, advancers edged out decliners, 967
to 943. National Market System volume was active at 131.9
million shares, well ahead of Wednesday's 114 million.
   Apple Computer's 5% rise continues a recent trend. Apple
shares have climbed almost 18 points in the past two months.
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons gave the stock another endorsement,
upgrading its rating to "strong buy" on the strength of good
demand for Apple products.
   Interim Systems was the most active stock. H&amp;R Block began
a previously announced $1.66-a-share, or $45 million, tender
offer for Interim Systems. Trading more than four million
shares, Interim was up 1/16 to 1 5/8.
   Office Depot agreed to acquire Office Club in a stock
swap. The proposed transaction provides for each Office Club
share to be exchanged for 1.194 shares of Office Depot.
Office Club shares were 4 5/8 higher to 18 1/8. Office Depot
fell 3/4 to 16.
   Among other office supply retailers, BizMart was up 5/8 to
8 1/8 while Staples added 3/4 to 18.
   First Florida Banks tumbled 2 points to 9 1/4 after the
company projected a 1990 loss of $8 million compared with
earnings of more than $39 million for 1989. The bank's
management also will recommend suspension of the
first-quarter dividend.
   Topps was up 1 to 16 3/4. The stock gave up some ground
after reaching a new high at 17 1/4 earlier in the day.
Shares in the baseball card distributor have been strong
since the company reported favorable fiscal third-quarter
earnings on Monday.
   SciMed Life Systems climbed 3/4 to 29 as investors awaited
fiscal third-quarter earnings. After the close, SciMed said
net income improved to 50 cents a share from 37 cents a share
a year ago.

Telecom are soliciting bids for construction of an undersea
fiber optic cable linking Europe and North America.
   Quantum slipped 1 point to 18 1/8. This newspaper reported
Wednesday that seven Quantum insiders, including the
company's chairman and its chief financial officer, have been
reducing their stakes in Quantum.
   Midlantic lost 7/8 to 5 1/4 after the bank holding company
decided to omit its regular dividend of 25 cents a share.
Although it expects to show a profit for the quarter,
Midlantic said the dividend omission reflects expectations
for continued weakness in the local and national economies.
   Spiegel dropped 7/8 to 13 7/8. After the market close
Wednesday, Spiegel said customers are responding to
promotions but are putting more pressure than expected on
holiday sales margins.

volume. The company acknowledged Wednesday that its pricing
policies have been the subject of inquiries by a federal
grand jury. National Health Labs said its policies conform
with relevant laws and regulations.
