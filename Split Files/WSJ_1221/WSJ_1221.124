   Following are excerpts from an interview with KGB Chairman
Vladimir Kryuchkov that ran in the Dec. 15 issue of Izvestia.
A related editorial appears today:

   Izvestia: In public debates, including in the country's
Parliament, it has been repeatedly stressed that most of our
economic and social ills stem from our system, which needs to
be radically changed. Judging from what you have said,
dealers in the shadow economy and saboteurs backed by Western
specialists are chiefly responsible for the shortages and
other irregularities.
   Mr. Kryuchkov: I agree that most of our economic and
social ills stem one way or another from our socioeconomic
system. Not surprisingly, five years ago, we started
wondering whether we could go on like that. Political,
economic and legal reforms began. But, as is known, those who
use unscrupulous means to attain their own ends, often remote
from the people's interests, tend to latch on to any healthy
process -- and people are already trying to exploit certain
weaknesses, certain loopholes in the laws.
   On the one hand, the rapid enrichment of a comparatively
small number of people; on the other hand, a deterioration in
the lives of a substantial stratum of our society. I believe
that those who have dared to exploit the situation should
feel the full force of state and public control. This does
not mean, of course, that we must revert to leveling, to the
system that did immense harm to our economy.
   But can one tolerate sabotage, for instance? There is no
such term as "economic sabotage" in our jurisprudence.
However, the phenomenon exists.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: A Supreme Soviet resolution was adopted on Nov.
23. In particular, it gives the KGB the task of combating
sabotage, and many specific instances of exposure by KGB
officers of abuses and thefts could be cited. We report this
in the press -- unsatisfactory transport services, an
enormous number of railway wagons and other transport
standing idle, late deliveries, abuses in sales through the
"tradebotage" -- bearing in mind the phenomenon that existed
70 years ago. But what are the particular features of today's
economic sabotage? How is it being combated in the absence of
an appropriate law?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: do not have in our criminal legislation a
legal norm defining a crime as economic sabotage. In using
the expression economic sabotage, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
employed a term that people understand. As far as the
description of the actions embraced by this term is
concerned, that is already a task for the investigation
service and the court, which will, of course, be strictly
governed by the law. I think that those who sabotage the
population's supply of food and industrial goods and allow
them to deteriorate -- either by their own inactivity or
negligent attitude toward their official duties, or who do
this with manifest intent, seeking thereby to obtain selfish
advantage, and those who deliberately create shortages of
goods -- are to be held to account for their actions.
   At any rate, I would like to stress once again that in any
event one should act according to the law, and that no matter
how difficult the situation, it is impermissible to act
outside the law.
   We do not investigate tattletales or tales, though they do
come our way. If anyone wants to cause his neighbors
heartache, that comes within the sphere of purely domestic,
social relations and the state security bodies should not be
involved. The private businessman (not the rogue) can work in
peace, following the laws and norms of human society.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: You have spoken about the "destructive role" of
certain newspapers. Which ones precisely?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: Well, what do you think: Do all the mass
media play a constructive role?
   The mass media sometimes give space to those who have
caused serious harm to the state. And the concept of honesty,
justice and purely ethical concepts is eroded. Just see how
the arguments of those who once embarked on a path of
treachery are relished in the mass media. They are portrayed
almost as heroes. A very cautious approach is needed here.
After all, there are concepts of "patriot" and
"anti-patriot." No one has expunged them from life.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: Incidentally, the diverse newspapers of the "new
generation" include ones that openly call themselves
"anticommunist" and do not recognize the existing social
system, although they do not advocate its forcible overthrow,
relying on democratic changes. Well, are they to be closed
down? And who is to close them?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: There is nothing criminal in the fact that
someone does not recognize the existing system.
Non-recognition in itself is not an element of a crime. Our
legislation presupposes this possibility. If newspapers do
not campaign for the forcible overthrow of the existing
system but, at the same time, are critical of the system, why
close them down? God forbid that the KGB should take this
function on itself again.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: How specifically will chekists control imported
products, for you cannot post a KGB officer at every trade
base or on every train?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: Quite right. Chekists alone will not
resolve the task. Therefore we have turned to society and
asked the Soviet people to report to us information that, in
their view, merits attention. We will make selective checks,
at key moments. We are not thinking of monitoring every trade
base, but I believe that the workers' control groups that
will be set up will get the chekists' support. We are ready
to cooperate with them.
