   Eleven years ago, Invacare Corp. made and sold
clunky-looking wheelchairs -- much as it did back in 1885.
   The Elyria, Ohio, concern didn't have a business plan or
any new products on its drawing boards, and rival Everest &amp;
Jennings International Ltd. dominated the market. "Invacare
was a real pig's ear," declares Dan Moore, a Cleveland
entrepreneur who looked at its books.

   But a new owner discovered how to save dealers time and
money, and in little more than a decade increased Invacare's
sales from about $19 million to an estimated $225 million
this year. What's more, Invacare's wheelchairs now outsell
Everest &amp; Jennings, and the former leader is mired in red ink
after launching a price war in an unsuccessful attempt to win
back market share.
   The health-care industry is known for its breakthrough
products and lavish research spending, but Invacare favored a
more basic approach. It broadened its offering of home
health-care products, found out what its customers' needs
were and made sure they were met. Its success illustrates how
painstaking attention to simple marketing and distribution
can revitalize a company sputtering along on stale, almost
forgotten products.
   A. Malachi Mixon III, who assembled a group that purchased
the company in 1979 and took it public in 1984, says he
"recognized that there was a heck of an opportunity with a
sleepy company in a relatively sleepy industry." Mr. Mixon,
now 49 years old, remains its chairman, chief executive and
president.
   The company hopes to further capitalize on the general
aging of the population and the trend toward administering
more health care at home.
   In 1979, however, Invacare had been for sale for two years
when Mr. Mixon led the group that purchased it for $7.8
million from health-care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson. Mr. Mixon
had no experience running a company; he had marketed
diagnostic scanners at J&amp;J's Technicare unit in Cleveland.
   Mr. Mixon, a Harvard-educated Vietnam veteran, says he
believed that if he could increase Invacare's annual sales,
"everything else would fall into place."
   He ousted 17 of the company's 20 salespeople and began
paying the replacements double the industry's going rate in
an effort to stimulate sales. Then he gambled, raising prices
5%. Within a year, those combined moves helped boost annual
revenue by $6 million -- enough to generate a profit after
hefty interest payments.
   But Mr. Mixon felt Invacare would have to move much closer
to its customers if it wanted to expand on a grand scale. At
the time, Invacare's competitors were selling large volumes
at reduced prices. The snag for dealers, however, was that
they often had to wait three weeks for deliveries. For many
of them, that meant a lot of cash tied up in excess
inventory.
   So Invacare countered by opening warehouses in larger
cities closer to dealers, many of which are cash-strapped
mom-and-pop operations. The dealers now get daily deliveries,
saving them money.
   Invacare also offers incentives such as free freight
charges that competitors are reluctant to match.
   From a single warehouse in 1979, Invacare now has 32
scattered across the U.S., and is using them not only for its
own products but to distribute health-care goods made by
other companies. That outside business adds $12 million to
annual revenue.
   It also has branched out from wheelchairs. It now makes
hospital beds, respiratory devices, rehabilitation equipment
and other patient aids. By selling a long list of products,
ranging from mattresses to scooter batteries, for other
companies, Invacare can offer wider variety than its
competitors and reduce ordering and handling costs.
   "Instead of going to 30 different manufacturers, the
dealers are coming to Invacare," says Vivian Wohl, an analyst
at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., San Francisco. Ms. Wohl, who
has been recommending the stock since earlier this year, says
the warehouse concept gives the company a pricing advantage
over competitors. Invacare common closed at $19.75 a share in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday, near its 52-week
high.
   Warren Nelson, chief financial officer at rival Everest &amp;
Jennings, Los Angeles, says the people at Invacare "are very
tough players. All we're trying to do is work out our own
problems. I still believe we make the best product, but I do
like their stock price better than ours." In composite
trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Everest &amp;
Jennings class B shares closed at $1.50, up 25 cents.
   It's not that Invacare hasn't had setbacks along the way.
In 1984, it was hurt by manufacturing problems, and the next
year it spent about $1 million replacing respiratory devices
that didn't work properly. Mr. Mixon says the company learned
from its mistakes. Now, he says, Invacare makes one of the
most reliable breathing devices, and has sharply lowered the
cost of producing its wheelchairs and hospital beds.
   Mr. Mixon says technology has broadened the market by
making wheelchairs easier to manuever. And Invacare, seeking
to build on its lead, has brought out 53 new products this
year, more than the combined total of the two previous years.
   It also is dabbling in mass advertising, a rarity among
companies in its field. The first ad, in USA Today, featured
a motorized three-wheeled scooter and targeted older people
who might have trouble getting around on foot, yet balk at
the idea of sitting in a wheelchair.
   One recent introduction is Invacare's sporty wheelchair
line aimed at what Mr. Mixon believes is a potential $50
million market. He says the chairs, made from lighter
materials and featuring colors like "red hot" and "jungle
lime," should appeal to active people who play basketball or
tennis or compete in road races. Some look more like chariots
than wheelchairs. "We have these wild and crazy colors," says
Mr. Mixon, "just like when you buy a car or tennis shoes."
