   Two research groups independently announced they had each
targeted a separate gene that makes some women prone to
developing breast cancer.
   The discoveries of the two genes strongly buttress the
growing belief that women born with one of several genes are
especially vulnerable to the cancer. The researchers said the
genes also are probably involved in noninherited cancers;
cancers can occur if the genes are somehow damaged during
life by exposure to an environmental substance.

   While the scientists haven't actually isolated either of
the culprit genes -- they don't know the genes' chemical
structure, how they cause breast cancer or their normal role
in cells -- the new findings, reported together in this
week's issue of the journal Science, give scientists the
means to track down and identify these genes precisely.
   Someday, doctors may be able to use these genes to
determine whether a patient is at risk of getting breast
cancer, perhaps detecting a cancer at its earliest, most
treatable, stage. The findings may spur research into drugs
that blunt the genes' untoward behavior.
   In one of the studies, scientists at the University of
California, Berkeley found evidence strongly linking a gene
and breast cancer in women under age 45. These women all
belonged to families where the cancer was much more common
than in the general population. In fact, women who inherit
this gene have an 80% risk during their life of developing
cancer, as opposed to a 4% risk of breast cancer developing
for most other women.
   In the second report, researchers at the University of
Utah who also were studying families in which breast cancer
clustered densely, found that many of the women relatives had
a pre-cancerous condition that put them at high risk of
developing full-blown cancer. The condition, characterized by
aberrant but nonmalignant growth of breast tissue cells,
occurred among the women in several generations in a
frequency that was much like the inheritance of a trait
caused by a single gene.
   The new reports add to the bustle of cancer gene
discoveries during 1990. During the year scientists found
that most cancers arise when several genes within a cell
become defective. These genes appear to regulate growth, but
allow a cancer to advance if they are inactivated.
   Just a few weeks ago, scientists found that one of these
"tumor-suppressor" genes, called p53, could be inherited in a
defective state. Although the gene was found in families
where a rare form of cancer occurs in high numbers,
scientists believe the gene also may be involved in the
inheritance of other cancers -- particularly breast cancer.
   The study by Mary-Clare King and colleagues at
UC-Berkeley's School of Public Health uncovered the presence
of a gene located near p53, but unrelated to it. Ms. King
found the gene by studying genetic material from 146 women
with breast cancer in 23 families. Ms. King found that all
the women with cancer had a variation in their gene material,
or DNA, at a site on chromosome 17, while none of a large
group of healthy women in the family had the variation.
(There are 23 chromosomes containing all the genes that lie
in the nucleus of every cell.)
   "It's our sense that a defect to this chromosome 17 gene
is involved in the very early beginnings of a tumor
development," says Ms. King. "It's another patch in the quilt
of cancer genes."
   In the second study, Mark Skolnick and colleagues at the
University of Utah found that many healthy women in families
with frequent breast cancer have a condition called
proliferative breast disease. When the researchers combined
the results of the women with this condition with those of
the women who developed cancer, they found a pattern that
mimicked the inheritance of a single gene.
