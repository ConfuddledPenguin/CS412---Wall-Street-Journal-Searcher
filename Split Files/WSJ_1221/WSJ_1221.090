   The airline industry suddenly is in another buying frenzy.
   In recent weeks, a number of prize assets have been sold
or put on the block: United Airlines snapped up Pan Am's
London business; American acquired international operations
from Trans World Airlines and picked up Continental Airlines'
Seattle-Tokyo route authority; USAir acquired Midway
Airline's Philadelphia real estate; and Northwest got key
Pacific routes and a 25% stake of Hawaiian Airlines.

   Many industry observers believe there is more to come. But
as the industry becomes increasingly divided between buyers
and sellers, more questions are being raised about whether
all this is a good thing.
   Will consumers suffer if the airline industry is
eventually dominated by three or four big carriers? Will
competition disappear if smaller carriers can't enter new
markets? Or will having a few strong carriers make the U.S.
industry more competitive on a global scale?
   The top executives of the nation's airlines are at odds on
those points. Here is a sampling of some of their comments
from interviews conducted this week:
                                                                                                       

   THOMAS PLASKETT
   Chairman, Pan Am Corp.
   Pan American World Airways
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Plaskett is one of the few voices among airline
executives questioning the shakeout: "I don't think you can
say consolidation is a good thing unless at the same time you
talk about the risk to competition and the possible
anti-competitive aspects of only having three airlines. I've
not yet reached the conclusion that the concentration is in
the best interest of the consumer."
   The sale of Midway's Philadelphia operations to USAir
Group "is clearly eliminating a low-cost, low-price
competitor," he says. USAir dominates in Philadelphia. This
week's proposed sale of 40 takeoff and landing slots by TWA
at Chicago's O'Hare airport reduces competition, he says. "In
the long run, prices will be higher."
   "The bottom line is that the price of entry for new
competitors will be out of reach. It will be impossibly high.
The architects of deregulation had this vision of all this
new competition which would keep fares and costs down. It
hasn't developed the way the architects originally
envisioned."
   He says: "Once you get the concentration of major
carriers, the days of new entry will be over."
                                                                                                       

                                                                                                       

   CARL ICAHN
   Chairman, Trans World Airlines
                                                                                                       

   "This industry is screwed up," says Mr. Icahn. "It's
terrible. The industry is in awful shape."
   Mr. Icahn blames competitors' airplane buying sprees of
the late 1980s for today's overcapacity. "I said there would
be a day of reckoning, and the day has come," he says.
"There's way too much capacity in the industry. It's just a
disease that was accelerated with the Kuwait" crisis.
   Mr. Icahn says it is wrong for troubled carriers to seek
government help through tax deferrals or release of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. "It's not the function of the
government to save us," he says. "It's a free enterprise
system and we can't depend on running to our mothers if
things go bad."
                                                                                                       

   DAVE HINSON
   Chairman, Midway Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Midway is a child of deregulation, started in 1979. Today,
it is scaling back its operations and selling assets to
giants such as USAir and American in a struggle to survive.
"There is excess capacity. There's no capital. You have to
monetize your assets. The big carriers are financing the weak
carriers," says Midway's Mr. Hinson. "We did the things we
need to do to survive."
   The consolidation is a natural outcome of deregulation, he
says. "If you were going to run a computer model in 1978,
then this is a fairly predictable outcome. It's occurred in
every other industry," he says. "There is no practical
alternative to consolidation. It's either a free market or it
isn't." He doesn't consider government restraint the answer.
"The worst thing that could happen is any form of
re-regulation. It would be a disaster for the consumer, the
industry and the country."
                                                                                                       

   ED BEAUVAIS
   Chairman, America West Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Beauvais has no problem with natural market forces
pushing the shakeout in the airline industry. "The more
balanced the competitive atmosphere is, the better off
America West is." But given that his airline is one of the
few carriers started since deregulation that is still flying,
"there's something wrong. There's got to be something wrong."
The result, he says, is an oligopoly, and that hurts
consumers.
   "If we're part of an oligopoly, we're going to have high
fares," says Mr. Beauvais. "Heck, we're going to make a lot
of money. We have a responsibility to our shareholders. But
I'm not so sure that's good for the traveling public. But if
we're one of the oligopolists, we'll laugh all the way to the
bank."
                                                                                                       

   ROBERT CRANDALL
   Chairman, AMR Corp.,
   American Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Crandall is a big backer of deregulation and of the
free market forces it unleashed on the airline industry.
"Most of us are better companies because of the intensity of
competition that has emerged," he says.
   But he does see problems ahead, "I'm not at all sure that
if only two or three or four of us survive, we're not going
to get very oppressive regulation because only three or four
of us continue to exist. Now I don't think that's an
appropriate response. . . . Competition may be even more
intense if there are only three or four of us than if there
are only six or seven of us."
                                                                                                       

   ALFRED CHECCHI
   Chairman, NWA Inc., Northwest Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Checchi says he started hearing about possible
transactions shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
"Within a couple weeks, the phone calls started. What you end
up with are calls saying, `Have you thought of . . .'" he
says. "You saw certain assets being put on the market. People
were soliciting interest.
   "This consolidation process is upon us," says Mr. Checchi.
"Everyone is talking to everyone. You're seeing an awful lot
of transactions." He says his investor group acquired
Northwest in August 1989 because "the attraction was the
industry was going to go into consolidation over the next ten
years. The process is being sped up by the financial
dislocation caused by the Gulf."
   By the end of the decade, he figures there will be four to
five airlines, at the most. "I think it's the nature of the
airline business that its economics argue for larger
companies rather than smaller ones," he says.
                                                                                                       

   HERB KELLEHER
   Chairman, Southwest Airlines
                                                                                                       

   The recent moves in the industry are no suprise to Mr.
Kelleher. "A lot of people have been saying for a goodly
number of years that with a downturn, there'd be a lot of
consolidation in the industry. We're just going through the
second round now."
   Mr. Kelleher pooh-poohs the notion that consolidation on
this scale leads inexorably to re-regulation. "If you were to
say having a few carriers is a reason why the airline
industry should be regulated again, there are about 42 other
industries that should come first because they have even less
competition," he says. "You can have very strong competition
between a relatively few firms."
   Does this mean the big players will buy everything? "They
ain't gonna buy us," Mr. Kelleher maintains.
                                                                                                       

   WHITLEY W. HAWKINS
   Executive Vice President,
   Marketing and Stations, Delta Air Lines
                                                                                                       

   Although Delta is the only major healthy airline not to
enter into a transaction yet, Mr. Hawkins says the carrier is
ready to buy. "Anything that looks good to us, we'll do it,"
he says. "We've made it known we'd like to have gates on the
north side of B concourse" at the Atlanta airport. Those
currently belong to troubled Eastern Airlines, which shares a
hub with Delta in Atlanta. "And we've made no secret about
talking to Continental about Pacific routes."
   Mr. Hawkins says the recent shakeout is good for the
industry: "We probably could use a little settling in our
industry. There's a lot of chaos. And a lot of people going
broke, knee-jerk reactions. It has an unsettling effect on
our people and the traveling public."
                                                                                                       

   LOUIS VALERIO
   Senior Vice President of Finance
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Valerio says the sudden rise in jet fuel prices
following the Iraqi invasion "accelerated the need for the
weaker carriers to do something."
   Mr. Valerio says "weak balance sheets" will continue to
drive the financially troubled carriers to sell assets, and
the industry to consolidate. Calling the current
consolidation the "first cut," he adds: "There are some
carriers that are clearly not going to make it." He figures
consumers will benefit because they will get "stronger"
carriers to fly.
