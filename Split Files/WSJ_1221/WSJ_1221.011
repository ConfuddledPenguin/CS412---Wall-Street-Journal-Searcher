   ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. -- AAR Corp., hit by the hard
times plaguing its airline customers, said earnings for its
second quarter ended Nov. 30 plunged 98%, despite an 11%
increase in revenue.
   The supplier of aviation services and parts reported net
income of just $126,000, or one cent a share, compared with
the year-earlier period's $6.8 million, or 42 cents a share.
Sales rose to $115.8 million from $104.6 million.

   AAR makes and overhauls aircraft parts, and performs
aircraft maintenance for a number of airlines in the U.S. and
abroad. The latest period's results were pulled down in part
by a $3.3 million pretax charge that reflects how the airline
industry's problems have rippled outward to affect industry
suppliers.
   Included in the provision is $1.9 million to cover an
underutilized division's restructuring, a $1 million reserve
established against receivables due from an airline customer
that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, AAR shares were up 50 cents at $10.125. AAR shares
moved down sharply earlier last week, when the company
disclosed the second-quarter results on a preliminary basis.
   AAR had said the decision to downsize its major airline
airframe maintenance division in Oklahoma City "follows a
weakening demand for scheduled maintenance checks for major
airline aircraft. . . . Without sufficient prospects for full
utilization of existing resources, the company concluded that
(the division's) restructuring was necessary."
   The company said it will continue to "aggressively market"
various other types of service work on major airline
aircraft, and for all types of maintenance for regional and
business aircraft. These businesses, it said, have "typically
been less subject to downturns in the marketplace."
