   NEW YORK -- The dollar rocketed higher in a market shaken
by the prospect of a political crisis in the Soviet Union.
   The mark took the brunt of the selling, as participants
shied away from European currencies and sought the U.S.
currency as a haven.

   Unnerving what had been a relatively calm market was
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation
announcement early in the European morning. Warning that "a
dictatorship is in the offing" for the Soviet Union, Mr.
Shevardnadze lashed out at the nation's authoritarian
political mood.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5115 marks, up sharply from 1.4785 marks late Wednesday in
New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 135.85
yen, up from 134.05 yen in New York late Wednesday. Sterling
was trading at $1.8930, down from $1.9305.
   In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was
quoted at 135.90 yen, up from its Tokyo close Thursday of
134.58 yen.
   The news of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation elicited worry
from world leaders as well as from financial markets, which
were forced to focus on the economic, financial and ethnic
problems threatening to undermine Mr. Gorbachev's rule.
   "This is really the spark that reminds the market that
Russia is in very serious trouble," said Ezra Zask, senior
vice president and foreign-exchange manager at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh. "It took something like this to remind us, and it
will put a serious dent in the mark's luster for quite a
while," if there are serious repercussions.
   Because of Germany's proximity to the Soviet Union and its
prominent role in the reconstruction of Central and Eastern
Europe, the mark had been the chief beneficiary of optimism
about the region. Consequently, it stands to lose the most
from fears that that the high hopes were premature.
   Beyond the fear that the Soviet Union will experience
difficulties, this upheaval in the Soviet leadership feeds
anxieties that "the whole Eastern Europe thing could be
unwound," said David Gilmore, foreign-exchange analyst at
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei in New York. Furthermore, if Mr.
Gorbachev's foothold slips, the warmer relationship
established between the superpowers might be called into
question, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Persian Gulf imbroglio continued to
intimidate dollar sellers. White House Spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater reiterated that the Iraqis must be held to the Jan.
15 deadline to withdraw from Kuwait, while the Pentagon
issued a warning to Iraq's Saddam Hussein that U.S. air units
will be ready to attack on Jan. 15, even if all ground forces
aren't. The Pentagon's remarks followed indications from the
deputy commander of the U.S. forces in the Gulf that ground
troops wouldn't be prepared to attack Iraq for several weeks
after Jan. 15.
   While the market continues to consider global
interest-rate differentials and economic fundamentals -- two
factors that make the mark attractive -- unrest in the Soviet
Union and the Gulf situation are eclipsing those
considerations. Exacerbating the sharpness of the move
against the mark was the heavy overload of mark positions
accumulated in the market.
   The market's moves were exaggerated by its thinness. Even
small orders had a disproportionately large effect on
exchange rates, traders said. Technical resistance points,
therefore, had less significance.
   The yen showed less vulnerablility to the dollar's
upswing, with 135.00 yen serving as a strong cap for most of
the global trading day.
   A half-hour before the end of New York trading, however,
the dollar suddenly gained half a yen, bounding from just
below 135.00 yen to around 135.50 yen. By the end of the
trading day, the dollar had risen to its intraday high of
135.85 yen.
   "There were rumors of a large order to sell at 135 yen and
a stop-loss just above it," said a dealer at a Japanese bank
in New York. As soon as 135 level was breached, the stop-loss
order was triggered, sending the dollar shooting up half a
yen in just a few minutes.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.20 an ounce, down 80 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was trading at
$382 an ounce.
