   NEW YORK -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it will
post a larger-than-expected loss of $250 million for 1990,
which would be one of the worst earnings performances on
record for a U.S. brokerage firm.
   To bolster the sagging firm, Prudential-Bache's parent,
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said it is adding more
than $200 million in new capital to the brokerage firm. That
comes on top of the $1 billion the big insurer has already
poured in since acquiring Prudential-Bache in 1981 in a
failed attempt to create a "financial supermarket" offering a
wide range of financial services and advice.

   The projected $250 million loss would be
Prudential-Bache's third in the past four years. On Wall
Street, it raised new questions of how long George L. Ball,
Prudential-Bache's chairman since 1982, will remain in his
job. So far, the parent firm has given Mr. Ball its full
support despite the brokerage firm's continued losses.
   Prudential Insurance's infusion, amid one of Wall Street's
worst slumps, is the latest instance in which a deep-pocketed
parent has had to shore up a struggling Wall Street
securities firm. CS First Boston Inc., Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. this year all have
needed cash infusions of hundreds of millions of dollars
apiece.
   At the same time, Prudential Insurance took yet another
step to shrink Prudential-Bache and get it out of its riskier
businesses. Yesterday, the Newark, N.J., insurance company
said it is taking over about $600 million of
Prudential-Bache's leveraged buy-out investments and other
merchant-banking assets, as well as its interest-rate and
currency-swap portfolios.
   That will add two more businesses to the lines that
Prudential-Bache has left this year, including closing down
its takeover-stock speculation department and selling its
Canadian brokerage unit. It has also severely shrunk its
investment banking and limited-partnership departments. In
November, Prudential-Bache laid off at least two-thirds of
its investment bankers.
   Prudential-Bache asserted yesterday that it will be
profitable in a smaller form, now that it has taken steps to
pare itself down and given up aspirations of being a major
investment bank.
   "We have taken very strong steps, very major steps, very
wrenching steps to try to put ourselves in a place that
recognizes the future," Mr. Ball said in an interview. "It's
never fun to do that. For better or worse we've decided Wall
Street is a different street than it used to be, and that
we'd do whatever necessary to configure the firm for tomorrow
rather than yesterday."
   Prudential-Bache said its remaining core businesses,
brokerage for individual investors and money management, are
still profitable and are "expected to produce a very adequate
return on equity in 1991." The projected $250 million loss
reflects $370 million in costs of the major retrenchment
plan, the firm said. Among major brokerage firms, the
Prudential-Bache loss is likely to be exceeded only by the
projected 1990 loss of $800 million to $900 million at
Shearson, a unit of American Express Co. That loss reflects
Shearson's big retrenchment efforts. The Prudential-Bache
results are comparable to those last year at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, which posted a
$213.4 million loss reflecting its own retrenchment efforts.
   Prudential-Bache, while never a power in investment
banking, has the nation's fourth-biggest army of brokers,
with about 6,500. The brokerage firm had 19,000 employees a
year ago, but now is down to about 17,500. More than 1,200
employees were trimmed through the sale of its Canadian
operation, and another 300 or so through the pullback from
limited partnerships, takeover stocks and investment banking.
   Like many Wall Street firms, Prudential-Bache has suffered
from the slowdown in trading by individual investors and
others that began with the 1987 stock-market crash. Despite
that slowdown, the firm expanded its brokerage business by
buying the brokerage network of Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. last year. That acquisition contributed to
Prudential-Bache's 1989 loss of $51 million.
   Some analysts predict that Prudential-Bache will
eventually be sold or merged with another firm. This week,
Prudential-Bache confirmed that it was talking with Shearson
about combining the two firms' back-office, or
trade-processing, operations. But the firms denied the talks
would lead to any type of full-scale merger.
   Prudential-Bache is "not a great firm" right now, said
Perrin Long, veteran Wall Street analyst at Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "They lost a hell of a lot in merchant
banking and risk arbitrage," or takeover speculation, he
said. But Mr. Long said Prudential-Bache appears to be
"taking the necessary steps" to make money if the brokerage
business rebounds.
   Even without the $200 million equity infusion,
Prudential-Bache's capital base would still be "well in
excess of regulatory requirements," Prudential Insurance said
in a statement. Mr. Ball, in a 12-page memo to employees,
said the infusion was made so that no one questions
Prudential-Bache's "continuing rock-solidness."
   While Prudential-Bache's 1990 results are a blow to
Prudential Insurance's image, some analysts say the unit's
troubles won't hurt the parent that much financially. The
unit's loss is "only about 3% of Prudential's capital" of
$7.9 billion, said William Cavanagh, a vice president at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Prudential Insurance's chairman, Robert C. Winters, said
Prudential-Bache's loss "will certainly have an impact" on
the insurer's results. But with success in several other of
the parent's business units, including record sales of
individual insurance, "we believe we will be posting better
results than most of our competitors," he said.
   Along with acquiring Prudential-Bache's merchant banking
portfolio, Prudential Insurance said that "in the future,
merchant banking activity will be closely coordinated with
the parent."
   Mr. Cavanagh of S&amp;P said an important benefit is that "the
risk profile at Pru-Bache is less" because of the businesses
it has jettisoned. "When you look at the risk of the business
going forward, Prudential-Bache will have less risk and thus
the need for less net capital really," Mr. Cavanagh said.
