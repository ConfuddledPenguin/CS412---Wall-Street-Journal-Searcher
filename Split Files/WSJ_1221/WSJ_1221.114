   NEW YORK -- Program trading accounted for 7.8%, or 15.5
million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange trading for
the week ended Dec. 7, down from 11.9% the previous week.
General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit and
Susquehanna Investment Group did most or all their trading
for themselves rather than customers, accounting for 40% of
all principal program trading. Bear Stearns Cos., Nomura
Securities, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Daiwa Securities also
traded mostly for themselves. The other firms traded mostly
for customers. Program trading is the purchase or sale of at
least 15 different stocks with a total value of at least $1
million. In the latest week, 42.3% of program trading
involved index arbitrage, in which traders juggle stocks and
stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price
differences between the markets. About 67.5% of program
trading took place on the Big Board, 28.5% in foreign markets
and 4% in other U.S. markets such as the over-the-counter
market.
