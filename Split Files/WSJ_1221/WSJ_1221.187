   Adelaide Steamship announced in November a plan to cut
debt by A$3 billion and restructure. It had been criticized
by analysts for its complex holdings among associate
companies and said it would eliminate the cross-ownership.
   Bob Cumberlidge, managing director of Petersville Sleigh,
said the sale price reflects current market value and gives
the company A$1.5 million in net proceeds that will be used
to reduce debt.
