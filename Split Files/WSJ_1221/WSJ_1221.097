   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 532 money-market
funds rose $856.2 million to $428.86 billion in the week
ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 267 general-purpose funds fell $14.2 million to
$150.64 billion, and assets of 103 broker-dealer funds fell
$19.1 million to $166.12 billion. Assets of 162 institutional
funds rose $889.5 million to $112.10 billion.

   Assets of institutional money-market funds continued to
rise briskly, reflecting the "desire by institutional
investors to (take advantage of) the relatively attractive
money-market yields," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and
chief economist at the institute.
