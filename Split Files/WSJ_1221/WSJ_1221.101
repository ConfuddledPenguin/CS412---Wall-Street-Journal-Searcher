   WASHINGTON -- House Democratic leaders no longer plan to
make a proposed surtax on millionaires the top order of
business when Congress returns in January.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said he told President Bush Tuesday
that he wouldn't reintroduce the bill immediately, as he had
planned. "I am not interested in pushing it," the Illinios
Democrat said yesterday. "I don't want to talk about these
things until I see what's in the president's budget."

   For his part, the president indicated to Rep. Rostenkowski
that he wouldn't include his twice-failed proposal to reduce
capital-gains taxes as part of his fiscal 1992 budget request
early next year. He told Rep. Rostenkowski he didn't know how
the tax cut could be paid for under the new pay-as-you-go
budget law. Mr. Bush publicly made similar comments the same
day. But administration officials are split on whether to
include the proposal in his budget, and top aides say the
president hasn't made a final decision.
   The shelving of the two issues would defuse for the short
term the conflict between the parties over tax fairness. In
this year's budget fight, Democrats scored political points
by contrasting their own support for taxing the rich with
Republicans' drive for lower taxes on capital gains, which
mostly benefit top-income taxpayers.
   In October, the House approved a budget plan that included
Rep. Rostenkowski's provision for a 10% surtax on individuals
with taxable income of more than $1 million, which would
raise an estimated $7.6 billion over five years. Neither the
surtax nor the capital-gains proposal were included in the
final budget compromise.
   Rep. Rostenkowski previously had said that he wanted to
reintroduce a proposed surtax on millionaires and that it
would be tagged as the House's first bill, HR 1, a mainly
symbolic designation that Democratic leaders reserve for
their top-priority legislation. Yesterday he said, "I think
the American people are tired of taxes," whether it's a
millionaires' tax or a general surtax to pay for the Persian
Gulf deployment -- an idea Rep. Rostenkowski raised earlier
this month.
   His change of mind on the millionaires' surtax -- and the
president's on capital gains -- would mark a sort of truce
between the two old friends. But some House Democrats also
are concerned that spotlighting higher taxes as a party
priority, even when those taxes are targeted to wealthier
Americans, could boomerang politically.
   Nevertheless, the surtax is all but certain to resurface
eventually. Democratic leaders, and House members generally,
still believe the issue is potent politically. Also, under
the new pay-as-you-go budget rules, more revenues are
essential to cover any spending initiatives or tax cuts.
House Democratic leaders are considering the surtax as a way
to offset some tax cut for the middle class.
   The surtax "will be appended to any proposal to spend
money," predicted Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a Ways and
Means member who favors using any such revenues for
children's programs. "It is everybody's first, favorite way
to increase taxes to pay for things."
