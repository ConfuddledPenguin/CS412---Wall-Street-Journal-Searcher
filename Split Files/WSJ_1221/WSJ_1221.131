   MEDSTONE INTERNATIONAL Inc. (Irvine, Calif.) -- Richard
Ferrari said he resigned as president and chief operating
officer of this maker of renal lithotripsy systems. Mr.
Ferrari, 36 years old, said he wanted to pursue "personal
growth opportunities" in the wake of the company's recent
decision to abandon efforts to obtain regulatory approval to
market its lithotripsy systems for gallstone treatment.
Medstone said a successor to Mr. Ferrari will be selected
next month from among about four senior executives.
