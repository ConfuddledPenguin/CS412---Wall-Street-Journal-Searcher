   SEOUL, South Korea -- Samsung Electronics Co. said it
received a $150 million order to build a compressor plant for
Calex Narodni Bodnik Co. of Czechoslovakia.
   Samsung will install an automatic production line capable
of turning out 1.5 million compressors a year for
refrigerators, the company said. It said the plant will be
built in Zlape in the Slovakian Republic by the end of 1991.

   Samsung also said it expects to supply Calex with parts
for compressors when the plant goes into operation. Calex is
Czechoslovakia's sole state-run refrigerator maker. Samsung
Electronics is a subsidiary of Samsung Group, a leading South
Korean industrial concern.
