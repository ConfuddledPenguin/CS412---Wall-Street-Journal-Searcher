   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Siemens AG said it has signed a
letter of intent to cooperate with
Starkstrom-Anlagenbau-Rostock, an East German
power-technology company, in the field of electricity
distribution.
   The West German electronics group said SAR has a strong
presence in the northern parts of East Germany. Last week,
Siemens signed virtually the same accord with
Starkstrom-Anlagenbau Leipzig-Halle, a power technology group
in southern East Germany.

   "If these cooperations are realized, Siemens will receive
a full market presence for energy transfer and distribution,"
Siemens said in a news release.
   SAR has around 1,200 employees.
   Since the beginning of the year, Siemens has signed a
series of preliminary cooperation agreements with East German
partners covering telecommunications, power engineering and
other segments of electrical engineering.
