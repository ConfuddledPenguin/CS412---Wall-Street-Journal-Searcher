   London stocks closed sharply higher across the board in
active trading Thursday, as a variety of influences sent them
rocketing to post their biggest daily gains since November
1987.
   "It's very impressive, to say the least," said Tony
Rebello, chief dealer for London brokerage firm Credit Suisse
First Boston.

   At Hong Kong, shares tumbled 1% to their lowest level in
more than two months. Tokyo stocks were mixed in moderate
trading.
   At London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index finished up 63.3 points at 2284.4, its intraday high,
well above the intraday low of 2227.7, posted when official
dealings began.
   The narrower FT 30-share index closed up 55.9 points at
1795.7. Volume was 645.4 million shares, the healthiest
showing in months and markedly better than the 460.4 million
that changed hands Wednesday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2329.0, up from 2258.0 a day ago.
   Strength in stock-index futures contracts and unconfirmed
rumors early in the session that Britain could join the
European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism as early
as this weekend sent prices soaring.
   The market "really never looked back" from the opening,
Mr. Rebello said.
   Dealers said strong buying by bears frantic to cover short
positions buoyed the market, and some institutional investors
jumped on the bandwagon amid a shortage of stock, committing
to fresh positions so they wouldn't miss out on the rally.
   As well, U.K. traders noted that strength on Wall Street,
sustained throughout the London session, provided a good
backbone of support for movement on the FT-SE 100. Most
agreed that fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
hold the fate of the market in London in the short term.
   "If Wall Street goes higher, I think the bull will
prevail," Mr. Rebello said. Conversely, he added, if the
industrial average eases, it will most likely drag the FT-SE
100 with it as investors realize that Britain's gloomy
economic situation hasn't fundamentally changed.
   Although a slew of British economic data was released
during the session, the market largely ignored the figures
and paid practically no attention to U.S. trade data that
showed a wider-than-expected gap for March.
   Among U.K. indicators, the public sector borrowing
requirement, or budget deficit, came in at #2.12 billion
($3.56 billion) for April, higher than market forecasts of
#1.25 billion. Unemployment was unchanged at a seasonally
adjusted 5.6% of the work force in April.
   A cluster of corporate results hit the market, where
bullish sentiment was running thick enough to overcome the
uneven earnings news.
   Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas giant,
gained 11 pence (18.5 cents) to 466 pence a share, despite a
drop in net income for the first quarter.
   Whitbread, a brewery company, jumped 13 to 415 on the back
of a 17% rise in pretax profit for the year.
   Although Royal Insurance was hit with a pretax loss of #79
million for the first quarter from extreme weather claims,
its shares surged 31 to 464.
   One loser on the day was Coloroll, a home products and
fashion group, which fell 3 1/2 to 8 1/2. Its share price
tumbled after the group announced that it might be taken
private as part of a refinancing plan under discussion with
an unidentified bank.
   Among the major blue-chip gainers that benefited from the
market's strength, Reuters bolted 49 to #11.68; brewing
company Bass rose 26 to #10.13; Great Universal Stores
climbed 24 to 98; pharmaceutical company Reckitt &amp; Colman
rose 27 to #12.06 and shipping and transport group P&amp;O surged
23 to 601.
   At Hong Kong, stocks slumped on continued China jitters.
Late buying again helped to cushion the sharp fall.
   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped 31.26 points, on the
back of an aggregate fall of 28 points the previous two days,
to close at 2917.63. The broader Hong Kong Index lost 20.68
to 1916.54.
   Players attributed the hard fall to continuing worries
about the possible effects on Hong Kong if the U.S.
terminates China's Most Favored Nation status.
   At Tokyo, stock prices closed mixed Thursday in moderate
trading as strong selling pressure emerged to counter the
market's buoyant mood this week.
   The Nikkei index ended the day firmer, finishing above the
32000-point level for the first time in three days. More
issues declined than gained, however, pushing the
broader-based Topix index moderately lower.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 93.98
points to finish Thursday's session at 32061.60. The index
lost 29.42 points Wednesday.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei fell 9.28 points to close the
morning session at 32052.32.
   On Thursday, encouraged by renewed investor confidence,
participants actively hunted for attractive shares. But
observers said trading was a battle between such buying and
profit-taking, as was the case in the previous two sessions.
   The Nikkei index, which moved narrowly in the morning,
advanced 210 points in the afternoon led by gains in
electrical, automobile and other stocks, before falling to
finishing near the morning close. Investors' caution that the
pace of the market's recovery could be too fast helped slow
down trading, observers said.
   Volume on the First Section was estimated at 580 million
shares, down from 721 million Wednesday. Declining issues
outnumbered advancing issues, 518 to 422, while 187 remained
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section fell back Thursday after posting gains
for 11 consecutive trading days. The index, which gained 4.99
points Wednesday, was down 4.54 points, or 0.19%, at 2399.23.
The Second Section index, which advanced 6.60 points
Wednesday, was up 6.82 points, or 0.18%, to close at 3862.20.
Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 16 million
shares, remaining at the same level with Wednesday.
   Participants said the market mood is still optimistic,
despite a slowdown of price gains in the past three days.
   Share prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan; little changed in Frankfurt and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed mostly steady.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Taipei and Manila;
higher in Wellington and Seoul, and mixed in Singapore.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
