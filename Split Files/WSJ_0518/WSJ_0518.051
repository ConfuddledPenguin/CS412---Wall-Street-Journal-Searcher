   BASEL, Switzerland -- The developed world's commercial
banks continued to restrict lending to Third World countries,
according to a new report on banking activity covering the
fourth quarter of last year.
   The banks' claims on Third World countries that aren't
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
declined by $4.7 billion, with $3.2 billion of that reduction
in Latin America alone.

   At the same time, developing countries substantially
increased their deposits in the banks, said the report by the
Bank for International Settlements. Asian countries paced
these new deposits, which rose by $14.6 billion in the fourth
quarter from growth of $9.6 billion in the third quarter.
Deposits totaled $58.2 billion at the end of 1989.
   While new net lending of $100 million in the fourth
quarter doubled from the year-earlier period and rose by $10
billion from the third quarter, it occurred mostly within the
industrial area covered by the BIS report. The U.S. and Japan
were the largest borrowers.
   The good borrowing demand in the developed area stemmed
from "strong economic growth, merger and takeover activity
and tightening credit conditions in the domestic markets,"
according to the report.
   Total net international bank lending for all of 1989 rose
a record $330 billion, after a rise of $225 billion in 1988.
At the end of 1989, net international bank lending totaled
$2.64 trillion.
