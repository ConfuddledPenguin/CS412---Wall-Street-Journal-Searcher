   TOKYO -- Four Japanese steel companies have halted
production of steel pipes ordered by the Soviet Union, a
further sign of the foreign-exchange difficulties shackling
the Soviet economy.
   Nippon Steel Corp., Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., NKK
Corp. and Kawasaki Steel Corp. temporarily stopped the output
at the beginning of May, because they hadn't received any
payment since the beginning of the year. They are holding
orders for delivery between April and September of 130,000
tons of pipes for drilling and shipping oil.

   Though the companies will probably continue to do business
with Soviet organizations, they won't resume production until
payment is guaranteed, a Nippon Steel spokesman said. This is
the first time that the Soviet Union has delayed payments
this long, he said. The companies have sent a group of
trading company officials to the U.S.S.R. to request a
guarantee for the shipments.
   Japan recently doubled the rate on export insurance for
steel shipments to the Soviet Union. Japanese trading houses
also have been notifying the government they hadn't received
payment for textiles and chemical products. Moscow owes as
much as an estimated $200 million to Japanese companies. The
Soviet Union also has been delaying payment on orders to
other countries, even for necessities such as grain.
   After the decentralization of the Soviet economy last
year, autonomous trading organizations sprouted nationwide,
and some have been unable to secure enough currency to pay
their bills. But major Soviet procurement agencies were
faulted in the steel pipes case.
