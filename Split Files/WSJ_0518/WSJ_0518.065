   NEW YORK -- Prime time network television is rediscovering
the format that dotted its landscape in its infancy: the game
show.
   Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s TV network is scheduling two
half-hour game shows, "Super Jeopardy]" and "Monopoly," to
run Saturdays at 8 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. beginning June 16.

   The shows are produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises, a
division of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, in association
with King World Productions Inc. King World, the most
successful distributor of syndicated shows -- including
"Wheel of Fortune," "Jeopardy]" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show"
-- has been trying to launch "Monopoly" in syndication for
three years, but so far hasn't been successful in syndication
distribution.
   King World said it has a 13-week commitment from ABC for
both shows; it is possible that the shows could be renewed
for the 1990-91 TV season.
   Stephen Palley, chief operating officer at King World,
said, "We have been beating the drums for a long time that
game shows are great programming." ABC, said one King World
official, first approached the distributor about filling a
Saturday programming void. ABC declined to comment.
   This is the first time that game shows have appeared in
prime time since 1970, when ABC aired two Saturday series,
"Let's Make a Deal" and "The Newlywed Game."
