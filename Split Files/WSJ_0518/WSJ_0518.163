   Yamaha Corp., the Tokyo-based musical-instrument maker,
said unconsolidated pretax profit rose 17% to 12.11 billion
yen ($79.8 million) in the fiscal year ended March 31 from
10.36 billion yen the year before.
   Net earnings grew 16% to 4.25 billion yen from 3.68
billion yen, despite a slight decline in sales. The company
attributed the gain to successful development and promotion
of high-value-added products.

   Overall sales fell 3.2% to 384.7 billion yen from 397.6
billion yen, as both domestic and export sales declined.
   Domestic sales edged down 0.7% to 270.6 billion yen, as
the company's main product lines posted varied performances.
   While sales of pianos and organs, the company's main
lines, were sluggish, those of nonmusic-related products rose
at a healthy pace. Household goods, such as furniture, rose
6.7% to 43.4 billion yen from 40.7 billion yen. The company's
sales of yachts and motor boats posted a 15% rise to 18.6
billion yen from 16.2 billion yen. Sports equipment was up
8.8% to 26.48 billion yen from 24.33 billion yen.
