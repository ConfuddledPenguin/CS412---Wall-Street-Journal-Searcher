   Medco Research Inc. said it and Oppenheimer &amp; Co., its
investment banker, mutually agreed to end their agreement
under which Oppenheimer was exploring the possibility of
selling the Los Angeles company earlier than planned.
   The agreement was set to terminate in August, said Medco,
a drug company that develops treatments and diagnoses of
cardiovascular diseases. Although Oppenheimer contacted a
"significant number" of pharmaceuticals concerns about
acquiring the company, Medco said, none of them elected to
follow through. The company retained Oppenheimer in November.

   Medco said it didn't plan to hire another investment
banker immediately. The company added, however, that it may
later review various "strategic alternatives" available to
it.
