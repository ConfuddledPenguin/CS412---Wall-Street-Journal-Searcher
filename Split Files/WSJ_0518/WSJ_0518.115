   INCREASED TAXES on cigarettes top the tax ideas at the
budget summit.
   Doubling the tax to 32 cents a pack would raise about $2.8
billion the first year and $13.8 billion over five, the
Congressional Budget Office figures. Some Bush advisers think
anti-smoking sentiment would make the increase easy to sell.
Other ideas include a tax on short-term securities trades,
new taxes on industrial pollutants and selective increases in
some corporate taxes.

   Higher gasoline taxes and an oil-import fee have some
support, but face tough hurdles. A cut in the capital-gains
tax is pressed again as a revenue-raiser. Interest groups
fight higher taxes on cigarettes, beer and wine with a study
showing the poor would be hit hardest. But such items "are
the most vulnerable right now," says California Rep. Matsui.
   Raising tobacco taxes could hurt re-election bids of some
tobacco-state lawmakers, such as Kentucky GOP Sen. McConnell.
                                                                                                       

   REARGUARD STRATEGIES at the Pentagon aim to preserve aging
weapons.
   Rather than oppose administration efforts to kill weapons,
the military seeks to retain production options. Army
generals urge replacing turrets in existing tanks as a way to
keep at least one General Dynamics M-1 tank plant open.
Michigan Sen. Levin, usually a defense-spending critic, backs
the Army; one plant is in his state.
   The Army also wants to stretch out production of the
Bradley fighting vehicle, mainly to give FMC Corp. time to
find other Pentagon work. The Air Force tries to protect F-16
jets' output by devising new uses, such as providing close-in
protection for infantry troops. Some lawmakers complain about
mixed Pentagon signals.
                                                                                                       

   BUSH AND QUAYLE are big fund-raisers but have short
political coattails.
   Bush raised $24.3 million for the GOP and its candidates
at 22 events last year, plus $21.8 million at 17 events so
far in 1990. This weekend alone he'll hit Texas, Oregon and
California. Quayle travels even more for fund-raisers and has
raised $8.4 million.
   But such efforts "haven't given candidates much of a boost
at the ballot box," says Democratic campaign official Howard
Schloss. Florida Gov. Martinez still trails for re-election,
despite Bush visits. The GOP Senate challenger in Alabama
remains a long shot. Sen. Wilson, running for California
governor, needs help from Bush to improve the GOP's
environmental image more than he needs money.
   Quayle's trip to Texas for GOP gubernatorial candidate
Williams gets mostly bad press about their shared propensity
for verbal gaffes.
                                                                                                       

   VETO BLUFF? The White House informally warns that Bush
might veto the Clean Air bill if the cost to industry exceeds
current estimates of $21.5 billion a year by 2005. But
political analyst Kevin Phillips says if Bush does so, "he's
going to pay a price and Republicans are going to pay a price
with him" in the elections.
                                                                                                       

   HATCH ACTS to back a candidate for FDA chief. The
Republican Utah senator pushes a former aide: David Kessler,
medical director of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York. Some Democratic congressional staffers also like
Kessler, but Bush isn't moving quickly to fill the post.
                                                                                                       

   DRUGS OR OZONE? The U.S. and allies planning July's
economic summit differ on which other issues to air at the
seven-nation meeting in Houston. The Europeans are eager to
play up environmental issues, the U.S. drug-related matters.
                                                                                                       

   HELMS HUNT: Democrats' hopes to beat GOP Sen. Helms in
North Carolina could sink if front-runner Michael Easley wins
a runoff June 5 and his rival, black former Charlotte Mayor
Harvey Gantt, isn't active in the general election. "But,"
says political analyst Charles Cook, "there are harder things
to do in the world than galvanize blacks against Jesse
Helms."
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS FEAR redistricting plans in California would
cost House seats.
   One of two GOP-backed propositions on the June 5 ballot
would require any redistricting plan to be approved by
two-thirds of the legislature. The other would have changes
done through an independent commission appointed by judges.
Either plan, charges state Democratic Chairman Jerry Brown,
"gives the Republicans 12 to 15 more seats in Congress."
   Democrats fight back in TV ads with actor Jack Lemmon
urging, "Stop the reapportionment fraud." They say the
commission would be picked by "old white men." But the
propositions' backers charge in ads that Democrats unfairly
reshaped districts a decade ago. Says Alan Heslop, a
reapportionment expert who backs the GOP: "The Democrats
deserve to lose at least a half-dozen seats."
   The League of Women Voters, says its Ellen Elliott, backs
the independent body because it would mean "no more districts
that are contiguous only at low tide."
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: When Raymond Wittig, a former aide to GOP
Rep. McDade, was indicted last week, the message on his home
phone was: "Wittigs' crisis center. We already have plenty
but feel free to add another." . . . Covering all the bases:
At a fund-raising breakfast, Democratic Rep. Murtha sat
between a Georgetown University priest and New York Yankee
owner George Steinbrenner. . . . Asked who at the budget
summit would be courageous enough to propose new taxes, Sen.
Dole replies: "Maybe the custodian."
