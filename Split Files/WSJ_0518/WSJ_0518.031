   HONG KONG -- Options trading could start in Hong Kong
sometime next year if a preliminary study being carried out
by the stock exchange finds sufficient market interest.
   Brisk interest in stock and index options has been
expressed so far by most of the brokerage houses, investors
and regulators surveyed so far, according to John Parry, a
consultant with Trimedia Communications Ltd., a Swiss firm
that is making a two-month study of the issue.

   The study is seeking to establish whether options would be
used by investors, how they would affect the colony's
financial market and what kind of training and promotional
programs they would require.
   "The reaction we've had so far has been very promising,"
Mr. Parry said. "It does suggest at this stage there is
certainly considerable interest."
   If the exchange decides to go through with the project,
the colony would become the fourth financial center in the
Asia-Pacific region to offer options trading, joining Sydney,
Tokyo and Singapore. The move is widely seen as part of the
exchange's effort to expand its products, which have grown
over the past year and a half with the addition of listed
debt instruments and unit trusts.
   But the expansion has come amid generally shallow turnover
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the failure of the
colony's futures exchange to regain much life after its near
failure following the October 1987 market crash.
   Robert Gilmore, an executive director at the Securities
and Futures Commission who has worked in options markets in
Chicago and Philadelphia, said stock options could give the
underlying market a boost, judged on patterns elsewhere.
   "History has proven to us that options aid in cash-market
liquidity," he claimed, adding that the U.S. options market
is responsible for a substantial amount of trading in the
underlying stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   He also argued that Hong Kong must come up with new
instruments to serve increasingly sophisticated investors or
risk losing its attractiveness as a major financial center.
   It would probably take the colony 12 to 15 months to come
up with the regulations and operating framework for options
to be traded if the preliminary study were accepted,
according to Mr. Parry. Among the changes is the alteration
of a law that currently prohibits options trading; that would
require approval by the colony's legislative council.
   One issue centers on how many local stocks have adequate
liquidity and capitalization, as well as sufficiently
widespread shareholding, to be suitable for options. Many
local concerns are controlled by single owners who often run
their day-to-day operations.
