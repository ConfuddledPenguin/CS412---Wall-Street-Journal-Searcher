   Lasers May Zap Drills
   Out of Dentists' Hands

   ALREADY WIDELY used in medicine, lasers are moving into
the dentist's office, offering the prospect of painless
dental surgery and quick treatment of tooth decay.
   The Food and Drug Administration quietly blessed the sale
of lasers for gum surgery last week, the first time the
technology has been approved for general dentistry. Later
this year, the agency is expected to approve lasers for
treating cavities, potentially displacing the dentist's
drill.
   The devices won't come cheap, however: Dental lasers are
expected to cost as much as $50,000 apiece.
   The lasers, which have undergone five years of clinical
tests, generate an intense, garnet-red light that courses
through a fiberoptic thread and is directed by the dentist to
the trouble spot in a patient's mouth. Researchers say
low-power pulses can clear bacterial buildup, slice gum
tissue, desensitize aching teeth and zap cavities -- often
without requiring anesthesia.
   "It's quick, it's easy and it dramatically lessens
bleeding," says Dr. Joel M. White, an assistant professor at
the University of California at San Francisco who has
conducted extensive clinical trials of lasers. "This
technology can now be offered to nearly every patient in the
country."
   The dental laser has successfully treated thousands of
patients in clinical trials, and the device has already won
regulatory approval in Canada, Germany, Mexico and Japan. Dr.
Terry D. Myers, a consultant to American Dental Laser,
Birmingham, Mich., which holds the patents for dental lasers,
says that within a decade, "we hope to send the dentist's
drill to the Smithsonian."
                                                                                                       

   Meet a CFCs Substitute
   That Smells Good, Too
                                                                                                       

   SEVERAL MAJOR electronics companies have embraced an
all-natural alternative to ozone-destroying solvents used in
the manufacture of circuit boards.
   Electronics companies are among the largest users of
chlorofluorocarbon solvents (CFCs), chemicals that damage the
Earth's protective ozone layer.
   The natural solvents, known as terpenes, not only are easy
on the environment, they smell good, too. "It smells like an
orange grove" inside a factory where the solvent is in use,
says Lydia Whitefield, a spokeswoman for American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. She says the solvent is being tried at half of
AT&amp;T's plants, replacing CFCs, which the company is committed
to phase out within four years.
   Leslie Guth, a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Inc.,
Princeton, N.J., explains that some terpene solvents are
derived from orange peels -- accounting for the aroma -- and
are so benign that they are used in chewing gum and candy.
She says they clean circuits effectively and at less cost,
though they must be handled carefully because they can be
flammable. Ms. Guth says terpenes also may be used in place
of methyl chloroform, which also is suspected of damaging the
ozone layer.
   Vitronics Corp., Newmarket, N.H., says that sales of a
terpenebased board-cleaning machine have been brisk. Lockheed
Corp., Sandia National Labs and a half-dozen other customers,
including companies in South Korea and Japan, have invested
in the technology, Vitronics says.
                                                                                                       

   Little-Used Channel
   Acts as Eyes for Blind
                                                                                                       

   TELEVISION for the blind?
   That's exactly what Boston's WGBH-TV has developed, making
use of a little-used slice of the broadcast spectrum that can
be picked up as a separate audio channel by most new TV sets.
   Using this idle channel, known as a subcarrier, WGBH
provides short narrative descriptions of key visual elements
of a program during pauses in the dialogue. "Now they're
kissing, as the sun sets over the ocean," the vision-impaired
audience might be told.
   The free service, available on a variety of programs, is
carried by 35 Public Broadcasting Service stations. It
reflects renewed interest in the so-called separate-audio
channel, which was designated by federal regulators to carry
alternate audio and data. Most stereo TVs and videocassette
recorders are equipped to pick up the channel. Older sets can
be inexpensively converted to get the signal with a decoder.
   For now, only a few stations are experimenting with
subcarriers, which also can carry computer data. New York's
WNETTV is working on Spanish translations for some national
news programming; a Los Angeles TV station already offers
local newscasts in both English and Spanish. Maryland Public
Television uses subcarriers to transmit educational software
and data to schools for classroom use.
   The Electronic Industries Association says that "stations
are getting quite creative" with the subcarrier technology.
The association notes that some stations use it to provide
extra commentary during sports events, while others use the
channel to carry uncut soundtracks of R-rated movies.
                                                                                                       

   Some Rolling Payments
   For Rolls of Customers
                                                                                                       

   LOTUS Development Corp. has devised an unusual pay
as-you-go feature to bill customers who use its MarketPlace
software, a $695 compact disk that contains names, addresses
and demographic information on 80 million households and 7.5
million businesses.
   The program keeps track of each time it is used, like a
postal meter. Customers, who use the disk to create mailing
lists or tailor marketing efforts, get the first 5,000 names
free. After that, users call Lotus-credit card in handand pay
$400 for each additional 5,000 names.
