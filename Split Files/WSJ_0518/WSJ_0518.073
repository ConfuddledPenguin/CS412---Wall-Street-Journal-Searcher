   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- Seeking to get to the bottom of its
barrel of loan problems, First Fidelity Bancorp. said it
expects to set aside as much as $300 million for past-due
loans in the second quarter and slash its dividend 40%.
   As a result, analysts said that they expect the parent of
New Jersey's largest bank to post a loss of about $130
million, or $2.25 a share, for the quarter. The bank didn't
forecast results. First Fidelity earned $63.3 million, or
$1.03 a share, a year earlier. For 1989, profit was $159.5
million, or $2.51 a share.

   The bad news, the result of a stem-to-stern review of the
$20 billion loan portfolio ordered by the new chairman,
Anthony P. Terracciano, wasn't as dire as some had feared.
Some analysts had expected the bank to eliminate its dividend
-- not just cut it to 30 cents a share from 50 cents a share.
In response, First Fidelity shares staged their best showing
in recent months, climbing $1.875 to close at $19.50 a share
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In essence, the second quarter gives Mr. Terracciano, who
previously helped resurrect Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank
Corp., a free shot at any loan made by the previous
management under former Chairman Robert R. Ferguson Jr. With
those loans behind him, he now must demonstrate that a
turnaround is under way and show some gains in the company's
listless core earnings and high overhead costs.
   Michael Plodwick, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell, said: "This is where the honeymoon ends. Now
whatever happens is his."
   Once a hot "superregional" bank that was a darling of
investors, First Fidelity had been rudderless since late 1988
when problem loans were uncovered in Philadelphia and London
and the company posted a $176 million loss in that year's
fourth quarter. Mr. Ferguson's heir apparent, Harold Pote,
then president and chief executive officer, was forced to
resign as a result.
   Since taking the reins in January, Mr. Terracciano has
brought in fresh talent to newly created top positions, fired
about 10% of the work force, or 1,400 employees, and begun
consolidating back offices and more than 550 branches.
   Nevertheless, analysts remain worried about the direction
of the New Jersey-Pennsylvania economy and are holding off
recommending First Fidelity until the earnings outlook
becomes clearer.
   "Tony can do a lot, but he can't change the local
economy," said Felice Gelman, an analyst for Dillon, Read &amp;
Co.
   Mr. Terracciano said the increase in problem loans
reflects a weakening real estate market, a slowing economy,
and tougher examination standards being imposed by
regulators. He added that a significant portion of the $240
million or so increase in problem loans are ones on which
interest and principal payments are current. Normally banks
classify loans as nonperforming only when they are 90 days or
more past due; however, that practice has changed as
regulators have interpreted the term more conservatively.
   Even so, Mr. Terracciano said: "We presently anticipate
that the loan loss provision will return to a more normal
level in the third and fourth quarters. Thus, we expect First
Fidelity's performance in the second half of the year to more
clearly reflect its core earnings capacity."
   First Fidelity's capital and reserve levels aren't a cause
for concern. With nonperforming loans expected to rise to as
much as $850 million from $604 million as of March 31, First
Fidelity's reserves will stand at 75% of that amount even if
charge-offs double. The company's ratio of equity to assets
will drop to 4.2% from 4.7% but will remain above the 4%
level required by regulators.
   In a related move, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed First
Fidelity's long-term and short-term debt issues under review
for possible downgrades. About $750 million of debt is
affected.
   Separately, First Fidelity said that it is seeking buyers
for its Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., an asset-based lender
in New York City, and Latimer &amp; Buck, a commercial mortgage
firm in Philadelphia. Mr. Terracciano said the units are
profitable but don't fit the company's long-term plans. The
sales are expected to be completed this summer.
