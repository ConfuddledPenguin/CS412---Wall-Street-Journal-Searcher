   THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT grew by more than $2 billion in
March, to $8.45 billion, as a 10% jump in imports offset
record exports. Despite the wider gap, analysts were
encouraged by the 4.6% rise in exports, which was
broad-based. Analysts also predicted that import demand will
ease with the slowing U.S. economy.
