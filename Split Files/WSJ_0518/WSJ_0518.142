   NEW YORK -- The dollar fell against the surging pound
yesterday as the British currency barreled higher on
speculation that sterling might soon join the exchange-rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   Widespread rumors that the British unit might be brought
into the exchange-rate mechanism at an early date followed
the publication yesterday in The Wall Street Journal of an
interview with British Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major. In the interview, Mr. Major said the United Kingdom
government is determined to bring sterling into the
exchange-rate mechanism, but he didn't set a date.

   The mechanism links together the major European Community
currencies within set exchange-rate bands. Britain has been
the only major EC member to stand outside the arrangement.
   After the close of most trading in New York, Mr. Major
reiterated in a London speech that Britain's participation in
the exchange-rate mechanism is still conditional on lower
inflation in the U.K., and he said an acceptable rate of
price increases is unlikely to be achieved for "a few months
yet."
   "We must force it {inflation} down closer to the average
of our competitors," Mr. Major said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. unit finished about half a pfennig
higher against the mark, closing just below the
psychologically important level of 1.65 marks on a sell-off
of the mark against the yen.
   The announcement earlier of a wider-than-expected U.S.
trade gap for March wasn't a large factor in dollar dealings
yesterday, participants said. The trade gap was reported at
$8.45 billion.
   Mr. Major's statements to The Wall Street Journal caused a
burst of pound buying as participants speculated about when
the British unit might be brought into the exchange-rate
mechanism. His words were taken by the market to indicate a
significant easing of the British government's ideological
opposition to the inclusion of the pound in the mechanism.
   "It's EMS euphoria. We're all expecting it to happen
soon," said one London trader. Some participants -- speaking
prior to Mr. Major's speech in London yesterday -- said the
entry might come as early as this weekend, although others
said such an early entry would be unlikely, due to the
necessity for negotiations on the value at which the British
unit would enter the exchange-rate mechanism.
   Traders estimated variously that the pound would be
brought into the mechanism at 2.60 marks to 2.90 marks. It is
thought the currency's EMS trading band will be set between 2
1/2% and 4%, said Abigail Cook, a vice president at Hongkong
&amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York. Sterling ended the day
in New York around 2.7935 marks, up sharply from 2.7644 marks
late Wednesday in New York.
   The apparent softening in the British government's
position was widely perceived in the market as a political
move intended to increase domestic support for U.K. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose popularity has fallen
sharply in recent months in response to her government's
imposition of a poll tax. Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party
recently suffered extensive losses in local government
elections over the issue of the tax.
   "I think they need anything they can get now. {Mrs.
Thatcher} needs something optimistic to happen over there,"
Ms. Cook said.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6495 marks, up from 1.6455 marks late Wednesday, and at
152.14 yen, up from 151.67 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6930, up from $1.6805 late Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 152.85 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 152
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6485 marks.
   On Thursday, dealers said the market didn't react much to
the U.S. trade report because participants are focusing on
interest rates. The trade report has declined in significance
recently, yielding the spotlight to inflation indicators such
as the consumer price index.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.50 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated
volume was a moderate three million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $369.05 an ounce.
