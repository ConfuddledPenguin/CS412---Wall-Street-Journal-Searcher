   TOKYO -- Two of Asia's leading economic powers, Japan and
South Korea, are seeking closer ties. But first they must
settle some longstanding, emotionally charged issues that
have kept the two nations at arm's length.
   That's exactly what South Korean President Roh Tae Woo
says he wants to accomplish when he makes his first official
visit to Japan next week. Specifically, Mr. Roh says his
people want a clear apology from Emperor Akihito for the
brutality Japan inflicted during its colonial rule of the
Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.

   "The Korean people aren't really sure of the depth of the
sincerity on the part of the Japanese," says Lee Hong Kee, a
special adviser to Mr. Roh. "To build a future, you have to
sever at least some of the old issues."
   But wounds as old and deep as these may take longer to
heal. In Japan, the Korean demand for an apology has stirred
a political and constitutional debate about the emperor's
role in foreign policy. It shows how uncomfortable Japan is
about confronting its militaristic past.
   Leading political figures, such as the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's secretary-general, Ichiro Ozawa, argue
that it is unconstitutional for the emperor, who is a
national symbol, to get involved in political or diplomatic
scuffles. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has put himself in the
hot seat, maintaining that he, not the emperor, should
respond to the Koreans. Yesterday, Mr. Kaifu said he would
offer a heartfelt apology on Japan's behalf.
   The apology may top the agenda, but government officials
on both sides hope to discuss other pressing bilateral issues
during Mr. Roh's visit, which begins Thursday. The main
points are expected to be trade and technology transfer. To
keep its exports booming, South Korea imports parts and other
goods from Japan. But selling finished products back to the
Japanese market isn't easy. In the first quarter, South
Korea's trade deficit with Japan shot up 27% from a year
earlier, to $1.3 billion. (In the same period, Korea's trade
surplus with the U.S. fell nearly 82%, to $200 million.)
   "Japan has to find a way to buy more Korean products,"
says Satoru Okuda, a researcher at the Institute of
Developing Economies in Tokyo.
   On technology transfer, rising labor costs and a stronger
won are forcing the Koreans to continue upgrading their
technology if they want to remain competitive. As other
countries have complained, however, Japan isn't eager to
share technology, especially with potential rivals.
   It isn't clear what Mr. Roh will hear during his three-day
visit, which will include a banquet hosted by Emperor
Akihito, meetings with Mr. Kaifu and a speech before the
Diet, Japan's parliament. But on the apology question,
political observers say the consensus-minded Japanese
probably will go down to the wire carefully debating the
wording of any statement.
   At the very least, observers expect that Mr. Roh will hear
a message similar to the one expressed by the late Emperor
Hirohito to President Chun Doo Hwan, the first South Korean
head of state to visit Japan, in 1984. The emperor said at a
banquet for Mr. Chun: "It is indeed regrettable that there
was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this
century, and I believe that it should not be repeated again."
But Koreans say those remarks were hard to understand and
didn't go far enough.
   It also isn't clear just what it will take to satisfy the
Koreans. At the moment, many seem intent on using the
opportunity of the state visit to stir up the bad blood
between the two neighbors. South Korean newspapers are filled
these days with stories about the treatment of Koreans in
Japan. One story told of how Koreans were forced to build a
bomb shelter for the emperor during World War II. They
recorded their suffering in Korean script on the walls of the
shelter.
   Then there is the thorny problem of the current status of
the 750,000 Korean residents in Japan, an issue that a few
weeks ago threatened to derail Mr. Roh's travel plans.
Although an agreement was reached that gives the
grandchildren of the original immigrants the right to
permanent residence in Japan, South Korea isn't satisfied
with how Japan is treating the first and second generation
residents who make up Japan's largest ethnic minority.
   The Japanese, meanwhile, are decidedly uncomfortable with
the Koreans airing these issues. In an editorial, the
Mainichi newspaper said this week that the root of the
problem lies in the fact that Japan hasn't come to terms with
certain aspects of the past.
   And some question if an apology will make much difference.
"No matter what the emperor says, it won't really change
things between us," says Mr. Okuda.
