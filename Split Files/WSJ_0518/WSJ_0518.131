   NEW YORK -- Unisys Corp. made a series of hardware and
software announcements that fill gaps in its plan to bet its
future on computers that use the Unix operating system.
   Consultants said the moves don't provide breakthroughs but
will help Unisys emphasize to customers how serious it is
about Unix -- which has become popular because customers are
looking for software that runs on numerous types of computers
and doesn't lock them into buying hardware from a single
supplier.

   "This positions them as a solid supplier of Unix
products," said Tom Willmott, a consultant with Aberdeen
Group, Boston.
   The main part of the computer and defense-electronics
company's announcements addresses two software problems
related to the fact that there are dozens and dozens of
different varieties of the Unix operating system. Cyril
Yansouni, a Unisys executive vice president, calls the
problems "the dark side of Unix."
   Unisys said it had worked with 30 software companies to
ensure that 50 of the major packages of Unix software can
work together. At the moment, software that runs on the Unix
operating system has a disturbing tendency to break other
software packages running on Unix -- a problem exacerbated by
the fact that there are so many flavors of Unix on the
market.
   Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., will sell customers any
combination of these packages and handle any problems that
crop up. At the moment, customers complain that any company
with hardware or software that is part of a Unix system gives
customers the runaround by insisting that somebody else
caused the problem.
   Unisys also said it did considerable work to insure that
the same version of Unix that runs on its entry-level
workstations can run on its biggest superminicomputers -- not
a trivial task, given that the underlying hardware is so
different. In principle, customers like not having to monkey
around with variations in operating systems. However, in
practice, consultants weren't sure that many customers had
software that would need to run on such a broad spectrum of
machines.
   On the hardware side, Unisys introduced some workstations,
including some based on Intel Corp.'s new 80486 processor. It
also unveiled revised midsized and high-end systems using
slightly faster versions of the original Intel processors.
   In addition, Unisys unveiled what it called a workstation,
whose list price has been kept to $2,395 largely by omitting
a hard-disk drive. The design is slick: The system consists
of just a keyboard and a monitor, because a "Personality
Pack" containing the computer attaches to the back of the
monitor. Disk-less workstations, however, have generally met
with just middling success.
   Unisys has acknowledged that it has a long way to go with
its Unix strategy. While the Unix business has grown rapidly,
it lost money last year, and many companies are finding
profits hard to come by in an area where competition among
computer makers is so fierce. But Mr. Yansouni was
optimistic, pointing to some large contracts Unisys won
recently and to opportunities for cost-cutting.
