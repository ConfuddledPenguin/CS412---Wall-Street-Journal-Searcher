   WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has chosen
Jay Powell, an executive at Mr. Brady's former firm of
Dillon, Read &amp; Co., to be assistant Treasury secretary for
domestic finance.
   The choice has not yet been approved by the White House
and is subject to Senate confirmation. But if Mr. Powell
passes those hurdles, he will succeed David Mullins, who was
recently confirmed by the Senate as a member of the Federal
Reserve's Board of Governors.

   Mr. Powell was trained as a lawyer and specializes in
securities law. In recent years, he has worked in corporate
finance at Dillon Read, where he became acquainted with Mr.
Brady.
   In the new post, Mr. Powell will oversee several critical
projects under way at the Treasury. He will be in charge of a
Treasury review of financial institutions and the deposit
insurance system. He also will supervise a Treasury project
on corporate governance, which is looking at ways to
encourage more long-term thinking on the part of corporations
and investors. And he will be responsible for the Treasury's
debt operations.
