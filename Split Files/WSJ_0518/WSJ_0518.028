   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
said it plans to make a $14-a-share, or $34.5 million, tender
offer for the 12.9% of DST Systems Inc. that it doesn't
already own.
   The railroad and financial services data-processing
concern said the offer for the Kansas City financial services
company is subject to certain conditions, but won't include a
requirement for tender of any minimum number of shares.

   Kansas City Southern said certain of its officers and
directors holding 1.3% of DST shares plan to tender their
shares in connection with the offer.
   Kansas City Southern said that since DST went public in
1983, the public market for DST shares hasn't met
"expectations for providing liquidity or in causing a
transfer value to be reflected in the market for Kansas City
Southern stock."
   The company, which owns 16.6 million shares, or 87.1% of
DST, said that upon completion of the offer, it will acquire
all remaining shares, also at $14 each.
   DST said its board will make its recommendation regarding
the proposed tender offer following receipt of the opinion of
a special board committee's investment adviser.
