   NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to
another record, the third this week, fueled by signs of
economic strength.
   Those same signs of strength weighed on bond prices,
though. The dollar finished moderately higher against the yen
and mark, but weaker against the pound.

   The Dow industrials gained 12.03 to 2831.71. In early
trading, the 30-stock average soared more than 25 points
following the report on the nation's merchandise trade
balance. The trade deficit widened to $8.45 billion in March
from $6.10 billion the previous month. But stock investors
focused on a nearly 5% increase in exports, to a record
$33.28 billion, while imports surged 10% to $41.72 billion.
   Broader stock market indexes are still below their
records. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which reached
359.80 last Oct. 9, yesterday closed at 354.47, up 0.47.
   Investors are hoarding blue-chip stocks because few think
that the market can escape its vulnerability to weak
corporate profits. William Kufta, senior vice president at
Pitcairn Financial Management Group, is typical of a lot of
large money managers who have been buying selectively, but
keeping cash stores high.
   "The explosion of euphoria is in the right direction, but
a bit premature," says Mr. Kufta, who maintains a 15% cash
position currently. "We look for disappointments in earnings
and the budget deficit-reduction process. We don't think we
have the ingredients for a meaningful advance in the stock
market yet."
   U.S. investors kept an eye on London stocks, which
yesterday staged their biggest rally since November 1987. The
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 63.3
points, or 2.8%, to 2284.4. British bonds also rallied.
   Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette, said talk about Britain's desire to join the
European Monetary System raised hopes among investors there
for lower inflation, stronger economic growth and a more
stable currency.
   Yesterday's U.S. trade report dimmed the enthusiasm of
some bond investors, who were looking for signs of weakening
economic growth that could lead to lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose against the mark, mainly because of heavy
sales of the West German currency against purchases of yen,
traders said.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished higher. Advancing issues outpaced
decliners 832 to 649 on the New York Stock Exchange, where
volume totaled 164,770,000 shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds fell slightly. Prices on long-term Treasury bonds
fell 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to
yield 8.64%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mostly higher. In late New York trading,
the dollar was quoted at 1.6495 marks and 152.14 yen,
compared with 1.6455 marks and 151.67 yen late Wednesday. The
British pound was quoted $1.6930, compared with $1.6805
Wednesday.
