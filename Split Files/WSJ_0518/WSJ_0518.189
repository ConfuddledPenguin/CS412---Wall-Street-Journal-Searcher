   ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Kay Jewelers Inc. said certain officers
and directors, who together own 40% of Kay's common stock,
intend to buy up to one million more shares on the open
market or through negotiated transactions.
   The move, a strong show of support at a time when the
jewelry retailers' stock has dropped significantly, will help
to fend off a pack of short sellers. Kay has about 12.3
million shares outstanding.

   At the company's annual meeting, Chairman Anthonie van
Ekris blasted the short sellers "a bad bunch of people," who
have had a "devastating impact" on Kay stock. Short sellers
count on a company's stock dropping by selling borrowed stock
and replacing it with stock purchased at a lower price. Kay's
stock has tumbled from a 52-week high of $24.375 a share, to
close yesterday at $7.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   Mr. van Ekris told shareholders to "keep the faith," and
reiterated his expectation that Kay "will return to levels of
profitability this year." He didn't offer specific
projections on 1990 earnings. For 1989, the company posted
net income of $196,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of
$427 million.
   Earlier this week, Kay disclosed that three banks that
provide $32 million of its $86 million in lines of credit
want to withdraw from participation. Mr. van Ekris told
shareholders he is "fully confident a revolving credit
agreement will be in place in a matter of weeks."
   Martin Oppenheimer, who follows Kay's bonds for Koonce
Securities of Rockville, Md., suggested that management
consider an outside review "to make sure their inventory
control systems are good as they think they are."
