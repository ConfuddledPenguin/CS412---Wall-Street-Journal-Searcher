   WASHINGTON -- U.S. official reserve assets fell $20

said.

   U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund,
and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign
currencies -- at the IMF.
   The nation's holdings of foreign currencies in April
increased $9 million from the previous month to $46.43
billion, while its gold reserves were unchanged at $11.06
billion.
   U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month
rose $11 million to $10.1 billion, and its reserve position
at the IMF dropped $40 million to $8.69 billion.
