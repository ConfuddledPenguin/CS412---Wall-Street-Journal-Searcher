   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it
will cut long-distance, evening-hour charges 2.5% -- or $100
million a year -- starting July 1.
   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission,
the company said the reduction relates to prices of
direct-dialed interstate calls between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
Sunday through Friday.

   Under FCC price-cap regulations, AT&amp;T files price
adjustments annually. This reduction was made possible in
part by anticipated savings from further cuts in the access
fees charged by local telephone companies. Another factor is
a change AT&amp;T is making in directory assistance: AT&amp;T said it
will eliminate the free call to interstate directory
assistance now offered each month, saying only one in four
residential customers use directory assistance during a
three-month period. The price of a directory assistance call
is 60 cents.
   When the July 1 decrease takes effect, a 10-minute
direct-dialed call anywhere in the continental U.S. will cost
$1.53 or less, compared with the current $1.58 or less. The
decrease is AT&amp;T's 11th since 1984, when the Bell system was
broken up.
   A spokesman for US Sprint Communications Co., a subsidiary
of United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., said:
"We haven't seen the filing yet and can't comment
specifically. But we are competitive and will take whatever
steps are necessary to remain competitive."
   An MCI Communications Corp. spokeswoman said the company
is studying AT&amp;T's moves, "and, as is our tradition, MCI will
remain competitive."
   AT&amp;T added that it expects in the future to be able to cut
prices an additional $60 million in other long-distance and
operator services.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&amp;T closed at $42.875 a share, up 87.5 cents.
