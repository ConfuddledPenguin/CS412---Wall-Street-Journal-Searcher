   PARIS -- In a burst of deregulation, France in 1988
abolished most government controls on foreign investment.
Non-French companies supposedly now can build new plants here
without even notifying the government.
   Actual practice, however, is different. Politics still is
deeply entwined with business, as U.S. glassmaker Guardian
Industries Corp. is discovering.

   Guardian plans to build a new flat-glass plant in southern
Europe, probably in northern Spain or near Nimes in southern
France. The plant would cost 700 million French francs ($126
million) and create about 250 jobs initially. Later expansion
could add another 500 jobs, sources here say.
   With unemployment in the Nimes region running as high as
15%, the French government was preparing to offer Guardian a
hefty subsidy for choosing Nimes. The European Community
allows subsidies as high as 17% of the project cost in
depressed regions such as this one, and French sources say
discussions have "advanced very well."
   But there is a hitch: Guardian's big French competitor,
Cie. de Saint-Gobain, is furiously lobbying to block the
subsidy. Saint-Gobain just got through building its own new
flat-glass plant a few hundred miles away, near Grenoble, and
its own subsidy was less than 10% of cost. (The exact level
is a subject of some dispute.) Since the Grenoble region is
more prosperous, EC rules didn't permit Saint-Gobain a bigger
subsidy.
   The complex Guardian case illustrates how politics often
is thrust into European investment decisions, even when laws
seem designed to prevent it.
   With the EC planning to bring down internal trade barriers
by the end of 1992, foreign companies are racing to set up
European subsidiaries, and European countries are competing
actively for the business. Although supposedly regulated by
the EC, subsidies are endemic.
   This case is particularly sensitive. By coincidence,
French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux is a former
Saint-Gobain chairman. On top of that, Saint-Gobain is in the
process of completing the friendly takeover of U.S. abrasives
maker Norton Co. of Massachusetts. But however sensitive the
case may be, Saint-Gobain isn't holding back.
   Its position is simple: Saint-Gobain says it can't believe
its own government is helping a major competitor get started
in its own back yard.
   "We don't want Guardian to get a higher subsidy than we
got," says a Saint-Gobain official. The official recognizes
that Saint-Gobain could have received a larger subsidy if it
had located in a less-prosperous region, but he says that
isn't the point.
   "France already has five flat-glass plants, three of which
belong to us," he says. "If another gets built, we could face
excess production. We aren't saying they can't come. We're
just saying we don't want the government to create this
problem itself, through excess generosity."
   But while the government in the past blocked foreign
investment in order to protect local manufacturers, that
isn't supposed to happen any more. "We would rather have
foreign plants than unemployment," Mr. Fauroux is fond of
saying.
   Reality is somewhat different. The subsidy's total value
is up to the government, as long as it stays within the EC
limits. So the French government now is split between
Saint-Gobain backers, arguing for a low subsidy, and
development experts and local officials, who want a big
subsidy to ensure that the factory doesn't go to Spain.
   French officials insist that Saint-Gobain's lobbying won't
influence their decision, and that they will offer Guardian
an excellent incentive. "We are very favorable to the arrival
of this company," says one official.
   Officials at closely held Guardian, reached at their
headquarters in Michigan, declined to comment. Sources here
say a decision is expected within a month.
