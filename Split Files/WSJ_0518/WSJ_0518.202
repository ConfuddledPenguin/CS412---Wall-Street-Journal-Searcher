   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will indefinitely
idle its Lakewood, Ga., assembly plant beginning Aug. 6
because of slow sales of the 1990-model Chevrolet Caprice
full-sized car and the Buick Estate Wagon station wagon.
About 2,200 workers will be affected.
   The No. 1 auto maker had announced its plans to idle the
Lakewood plant in September, but didn't specify then when the
closing would take place.
