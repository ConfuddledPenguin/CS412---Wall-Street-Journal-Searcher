   NEW YORK -- It is the little things that still fill
Willetta Parker with elation: The long subway ride from her
Harlem apartment to her clerical job in lower Manhattan. And
paying her rent and electric bills. "For me to be working at
something that's legal]" she marvels. "To feel good waking
up, going to work on the train, to have a bank account -- all
these good things. . . . It's lovely]"
   And something of a miracle, too. Two years ago, the
21-year-old Ms. Parker was a crack addict, sleeping on the
same subway trains that now carry her to work. A runaway at
the age of nine, she had spent her adolescence on the streets
of New York, foraging for food in garbage cans. Eventually,
she kicked her habit, and drifted onto welfare.

   Today, Ms. Parker is a taxpayer. She earns $200 a week
typing and filing at a small publishing company. She found
her job 11 months ago through America Works of New York, a
profit-making company that aspires to be the Federal Express
of the welfare system. The efforts of the company and an
affiliate in Connecticut over the past few years have helped
more than a thousand people to get off welfare and into
productive jobs -- hardly sufficient to shrink the nation's
welfare establishment but successful enough to show that it
can be done.
   America Works runs an employment service whose clients all
come from the welfare rolls. Unlike job-training programs or
trade schools that put the unemployed through months of
classes and then abandon them during the job search, America
Works is a matchmaker. It spends most of its time and
resources finding entry-level job openings and candidates to
fill them, and then helping monitor and support their clients
in the workplace.
   Says Lee Bowes, the company's chief operating officer: "We
are an old boys' network for very poor people."
   A New York state official calls the network's performance
remarkable. It is placing more than 300 welfare recipients a
year in private-sector jobs that pay an average of $14,000 a
year plus benefits. After on-the-job tryouts, some 70% of
those placed have said goodbye to welfare and become
permanent. After one year, 90% of them are still working.
   "Try before you buy" is a company maxim. Job candidates
try working while they are weaned off welfare, a scary
prospect for some. Employers, many of whom are initially
skeptical of the program, have four months to evaluate
candidates on the job without a commitment to hire them
permanently. New York State pays America Works $5,000 for
each placement, but only after the employee has stayed on the
job for seven months. Taxpayers gain because the $5,000
stipend is less than half the $12,000 that the state spends
to keep a family of three on welfare for a year.
   New York state officials say that the program has rebuilt
lives and assisted industry, and that it makes fiscal sense.
Even so, the state government may be too shy of cash to
continue paying for it. The legislature now is trying to cope
with an accumulated deficit and budgetary shortfall amounting
to $4 billion, and "the outlook for funding is very poor,"
says Oscar Best, deputy commissioner of income maintenance
for the state's department of social services.
   That distresses Abe Levovitz, a retired tallow
manufacturer in Newton, Mass., who financed America Works
with start-up capital of $200,000 three years ago. "If this
were a normal business venture and I was returning $2 for
every $1 the customer gave me, I'd have hundreds of people
lined up in front of my door," he says. "The only place it
doesn't work is in government." As he sees it, the company is
being penalized for performance; it fulfilled the terms of
its most recent two-year state contract in just over a year,
and now needs additional funding to go on.
   Mr. Levovitz sees another irony: "When the state gets new
welfare applicants, do they say, `Sorry -- we don't have any
money?' No, of course not -- they pay them."
   True, says Michael Dowling, Gov. Mario Cuomo's deputy
secretary for human services. But he also says that "the days
of giving out a check and saying, `See you later,' are over."
America Works's program is consistent with the state's effort
to move people off welfare and into jobs, he says, and he
hopes to persuade New York City to agree to some sort of
shared financing to allow the company to stay in business in
New York. In any case, a separate corporation, America Works
of Connecticut, will continue a similar program in Hartford.
   High-level fiscal policy is far from the minds of most of
the job-seekers who appear at the company's lower Broadway
offices. Many go there in response to the company's monthly
classified ads. Others are referred by friends or the welfare
office, where America Works sometimes sets up recruiting
booths.
   Though illiterates or the emotionally disturbed may be
referred to other programs, nobody else who wants to work is
turned away. Recently, there's been an influx of
Soviet-sphere refugees, including a former provincial
governor from Afghanistan. "But our typical client has spent
10 or 12 years on welfare," says Ms. Bowes. "Half of them
grew up on it."
   Most are black or Hispanic women with children. Few men
apply. Those who do are harder to place and less likely to
stay on the job. Ms. Bowes says that is because most social
services that could help them succeed are designed to help
poor women and their children rather than males.
   Applicants must maintain perfect attendance at a one-week
orientation workshop to assess their skills and help them set
goals. Each week, about 20 candidates enlist; more than half
will have found jobs in three or four weeks. Ms. Bowes tells
a batch of new recruits: "We find companies with openings who
really want to see you. We get our foot in the door and bring
you with us."
   Workshop leader Antoinette Franklin's job is to rekindle a
sense of life's possibilities in her pupils. Tall and chic in
a magenta suit, she prods the class to summon up long-buried
aspirations -- not, she stresses, "just what you'll settle
for."
   "Think about your dream," she coaxes. "Can you remember
that dream? Maybe you put it aside while you helped someone
else. Or did you lie to yourself, saying `I don't really want
a big old house I'd have to clean up?' Well, by the time
you're finished, you're comfortable sitting in a project
looking out the window. And the dream just kept shrinking,
didn't it?"
   Sheila Davis pops up. "I want to own a house with four
bedrooms in southern New Jersey," she says softly. "And I'm
going to try to get a good job."
   Ms. Franklin exploits the assertion to make a point. "Let
me tell you about that word try," she says. "It's an excuse
word. Those four bedrooms won't come cheap. Are you going to
get promotions and raises?" Ms. Davis says she will, and Ms.
Franklin nods in approval. "That's how you earn it," she
says. "You're going to work for it]"
   Elsewhere in the building, those who have completed boot
camp are immersed in the job search. Between interviews, they
receive coaching in basic skills and business practices, as
well as help in locating child care, suitable clothing and
sometimes even housing.
   Told by a counselor about a job opening, Herman Thomas
looks excited but skeptical. "Tell me the truth," he says.
"Do they really need someone to do this work?" He is assured
that the maintenance job is available.
   At the same time, a team of 10 telemarketers work the
phones, pitching the program to employers. Although it isn't
easy to sell at first, about 200 companies have hired America
Works applicants. The service is free to employers, and the
retention rate of employees it provides, in jobs with
notoriously costly turnover, is high. And there are other
advantages.
   During the four-month tryout, America Works pays the
employee a modest hourly wage, averaging $3.75, and bills the
employer about $6.50 an hour to cover the wage and benefits
and the cost of monitoring and support. Typically, the cost
to the employer during this period is about $1 an hour less
than the ordinary payroll cost for the position would be.
During this period the employee receives gradually reduced
welfare benefits. After a successful tryout, the employee
goes on the payroll at the going rate, and welfare payments
stop. For employees who stay on the job for a year, the
employer gets a tax credit.
   America Works's monitoring and support involves anything
from intervening in personal crises to interpreting corporate
customs and mores. The follow-through is critical, according
to Ms. Bowes, a slim blonde with a doctorate in sociology and
15 years of prior experience placing the disadvantaged,
mostly in public-sector jobs. She says welfare recipients
often fail at jobs not because they lack the skills but
because "they don't understand the subtle cues -- the
implicit rules of the workplace."
   A Hispanic woman client had come to work each morning and
heated up pungent dinner leftovers in the office microwave.
Without counseling, Ms. Bowes says, she might have been let
go. But she stopped the practice when her America Works
counselor showed her that it was offensive to others in the
office.
   American International Group, an insurance and
financial-services company with headquarters in the Wall
Street area, has hired 12 clerical employees through America
Works. Their motivation, attitude and long-term commitment
have been outstanding, says Janice Wersching, an AIG
personnel manager. She says clerical turnover at AIG has run
25% or 30% a year, and many ordinary applicants have often
failed even to appear for interviews. By contrast, she says
employees sponsored by America Works show up on time, value
their jobs, and keep them.
   Eagerness to be free of the hated "system" -- welfare --
motivates many. A former prison inmate, now employed,
gleefully recites the exact day her welfare case was closed
-- and how later, when a caseworker mistakenly summoned her
to the welfare office, she could say: "You can cancel that
appointment. I don't need it."
   Linda McGinnis, a mother of five with 16 years of welfare
behind her, took a gamble when she returned to work as an
assistant bookkeeper a year ago. "The salary was less than
welfare," she says, "but I knew I had to start somewhere, and
to better myself I'd have to wait." She did more than wait.
Every lunch hour during her job tryout, she returned to the
America Works office to practice her typing. After three
raises, she is earning $16,000 a year and plans to send her
oldest son to college this fall.
