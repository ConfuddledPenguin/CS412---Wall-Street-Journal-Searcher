   John Balson, president and chief executive officer of
Lear's Publishing Co., was dismissed by Frances Lear, the
company's founder and editor in chief of Lear's magazine.
   A spokesman for Ms. Lear gave no explanation for the
change, except that Ms. Lear and Mr. Balson had "mutually
agreed to end their association." Mr. Balson, 48 years old,
had been Lear's top executive for a year. He couldn't be
reached for comment.

   In a related development, Ms. Lear, through the spokesman,
said she is looking for partners for the magazine company.
Lear Publishing has explored "the possibility of enlarging
the scope of its magazine by seeking partners within the
industry and becoming part of a larger group of magazines,"
the spokesman said.
   Ms. Lear said no replacement will be named for Mr. Balson
and she will reassume the duties of chief executive.
   Lear's, a monthly magazine for women over 40 years old,
has grown quickly since being launched in 1988. Paid
circulation has grown to more than 450,000.
