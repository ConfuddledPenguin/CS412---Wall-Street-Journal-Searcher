   NEW YORK -- Amrep Corp., a builder of communities and
international distributor of magazines, said it agreed to
sell water and sewer utility systems serving Rio Rancho and
Santa Fe, N.M., to a subsidiary of GWC Corp., a Wilmington,
Del., water utility holding company, for more than $36
million.
   Of the proceeds, about $20.5 million will be used to repay
utility debt, and part of the remainder will be applied to
reduce other debt, with the balance to be added to working
capital.
