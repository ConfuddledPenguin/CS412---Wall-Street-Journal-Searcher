   AFABET, Ethiopia -- In this poor land, where little grows
and less is manufactured, the two-inch spines of thorny
acacia trees have a special use.
   For tribal midwives, they make a primitive kind of suture.
Here, as in many regions of Africa, custom demands that girls
undergo excision of the clitoris and infibulation, the
stitching of the genitals, to ensure chastity before
marriage.

   Until two years ago, Aset Abraham believed this practice
was essential. "My mother, my grandmother and my
great-grandmother all told me it was right -- that without
{this procedure} a woman would end up a prostitute," says the
28-year-old. She was also told the procedure made a woman
more attractive. The operation is often explained by an old
saying: "A house without a door isn't beautiful."
   Now, working as a birth attendant in this rebel-held
region of Eritrea province, Ms. Abraham is a fighter in a
quiet battle to end the agony and disease that such
traditions inflict on African women.
   Until 1988, Afabet was a garrison town of Haile Mariam
Mengistu's Ethiopian army. Ms. Abraham was brought there by
force from her home in the Eritrean city of Asmara, to work
as a cleaner. While working, she had to endure the sexual
advances of Ethiopian soldiers, and as a result, she has two
sons, aged four and eight.
   An offensive by the Eritrean People's Liberation Army
pushed the Ethiopian forces from the town, bringing new ideas
about health, education and social organization.
   The guerrillas have battled for 28 years to reverse
Ethiopia's annexation of this Red Sea province and, despite
desperate poverty, have begun radical social experiments on
the land they hold.
   Ms. Abraham is part of one such venture. The guerrillas
had the people of Afabet select women to train as birth
attendants, hoping that locals, rather than outsiders, will
better be able to convince others to abandon harmful
traditions.
   Some 20% of Eritrean women die in childbirth, sometimes
because the birth canal is obstructed by scar tissue from
infibulation. Many are weakened by untreated diseases such as
typhoid, malaria and tuberculosis; most are malnourished.
   At the guerrillas' four-month course, Ms. Abraham and 20
other women from the Afabet area learned about nutrition,
hygiene, family planning and midwifery.
   Never having heard of contraception, "it really surprised
me that you can have a break between children," she says. Now
she is spreading the good news.
   But traditions such as infibulation can't be wiped out
overnight. "It is a difficult job," she says. "Now I know
there's no use to it, and as I was convinced I hope I will
convince others." But if a woman insists, Ms. Abraham still
will do the procedure, hoping that her more-hygienic
techniques will do less damage.
   Ms. Abraham understands the women's pressures and
anxieties because she lives amid the same daily hardships of
poverty and war. Her hut has an earth floor and a ceiling
made of wheat sacks recycled from a Canadian food donation.
Her own crochet-work brightens the hut, along with a few
colorful hand-woven baskets. Occasionally, she has to pause
in her conversation to chase out one of the chickens or goats
she keeps to supplement her children's diet with eggs and
milk.
   As a trained birth attendant, she now receives a small
salary from the Eritrean Relief Association, the aid group
that operates in guerrilla-held areas. She stretches her
income by making and selling "sewa", a beer made of fermented
stale bread.
   Often though, her life and work are disrupted by Ethiopian
government bombings, from which her fragile dwelling provides
little shelter. The town has been hit frequently, with many
civilian casualties.
   During protracted raids, she flees to the countryside,
returning only at night to get food. But it is the single,
unpredictable air strike coming after weeks of quiet that she
fears most, because there is no way to prepare for it.
   "When I hear the MiGs I just run and collect my children
and hide with them under the bed," she says.
