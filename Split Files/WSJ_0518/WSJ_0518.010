   For the past five years the political taboo against
discussing tax increases has made it impossible to negotiate
any serious reduction in the budget deficit. Now that a tax
increase is on the table, a significant budget deal looks
quite likely. It's time now to consider adjusting the future
growth of Social Security benefits as well.
   Only by considering Social Security benefits as well as
taxes can the negotiating process produce a serious and fair
long-term plan to eliminate the budget deficit. And extending
the Gramm-Rudman process to include parallel automatic
adjustments to taxes and Social Security benefits could be
the centerpiece of a reformed budget process that limits
spending increases and guarantees an eventual budget balance.

   The budget deficit has been stuck at $150 billion a year
since 1987. The Office of Management and Budget's new
estimates confirm what private analysts have been saying for
a long time. Without tough budget action, the deficit will be
as high next year and will continue to be at least $100
billion a year in the future, keeping real interest rates
high and depressing our national rate of investment in
productivity-increasing plant and equipment.
   But even the new OMB estimates make no allowance for
accumulating a real Social Security trust fund. Instead, all
of the projected Social Security surpluses are devoted to
offsetting deficits elsewhere in the budget.
   Social Security should instead be removed from the
ordinary budget and the surpluses accumulated to finance
future benefits when the baby-boom generation begins to
retire. By 1996, such a safeguarding of the Social Security
surpluses would add $140 billion to the annual budget
deficit.
   Combining this Social Security accumulation with the
projected budget deficit implies that the appropriate
deficit-reduction goal for 1996 is about $250 billion. With
that much to be done, it's important to have a long-term
plan. The budget negotiators should be aiming for $50 billion
a year of reliable deficit reductions over each of the next
five years. A new Gramm-Rudman framework could ensure such
reductions by adding automatic adjustments in tax revenue and
Social Security benefits to the current across-the-board
sequestration cuts. Unlike the current talk about cutting
$100 billion in 1991 alone, such a gradual and predictable
multiyear reduction would not upset the pace of year-to-year
economic expansion.
   It is impossible to achieve such reductions by spending
cuts alone. The substantial reduction in defense spending
that now appears to be justified by the current military
conditions can make a major contribution to deficit
reduction. But even a massive 20% cut in current real defense
spending -- reducing defense outlays to the lowest share of
GNP in more than half a century -- would provide less than
one-third of the needed $250 billion a year.
   Nondefense spending other than Social Security and
interest on the national debt will exceed $500 billion by
1996 if there are no changes in existing programs. That much
spending should provide opportunities for substantial
savings. But although I have my favorite list of cuts, I'm
not optimistic about the amount that Congress will accept.
And many of the savings in existing programs will undoubtedly
be used to fund increased spending on an array of programs
that the public feels has received too little support during
the past decade.
   Turning to taxes, opinion surveys show that raising excise
taxes on alcohol and tobacco would meet relatively little
opposition from an increasingly health-conscious public.
Doubling the 16-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes and adding a
dollar in tax to the price of a six-pack of beer and a bottle
of wine would yield about $15 billion a year in revenue. An
extra 10 cents a gallon on gasoline would reduce air
pollution and add $10 billion a year to revenue.
   The combination of major cuts in defense and nondefense
outlays and the general increase in excise taxes would also
have an important favorable effect on the government's annual
interest bill. Even without any fall in interest rates, the
gradual reduction in annual deficits would cut the projected
national debt by enough to knock $30 billion off the
government's 1996 interest outlays. And if the smaller budget
deficits bring the interest rate down by one percentage
point, the additional interest savings would be $25 billion a
year.
   But even with all of these outlay cuts and revenue
increases, the annual deficit in 1996 would still be about
$75 billion. What should be done to fill this remaining gap?
   A simple and fair way to fill the remaining deficit gap
would be to modify the indexing of both the Social Security
benefits and the personal income tax. A basic approach would
be to adjust benefits and tax brackets by the excess of
inflation over 2% instead of by the full inflation rate as
required by current law. With a 4.5% inflation rate, benefits
and tax brackets would be raised by 2.5% instead of the full
4.5%. Even if lower-income beneficiaries and taxpayers are
exempted and each individual is limited to no more than a
cumulative 10% adjustment, this inflation-minus-2% rule for
taxes and Social Security would shrink annual deficits by $70
billion in 1996 and beyond.
   Although most politicians have been understandably
reluctant to suggest any modification of Social Security
benefits, any program of deficit reduction that can be
described as fair must include a slowing of the growth of
Social Security outlays. Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski recognized this when he proposed a total
freeze on Social Security benefits as part of his own 1991
budget plan.
   Unlike most other government transfer programs, the vast
bulk of Social Security benefits go to individuals who are
not poor. Indeed, benefits are higher for those who have had
the highest earnings during their working years and who are
therefore most likely to have substantial private pensions.
Full adjustment of Social Security benefits for inflation has
become increasingly unfair after a decade in which average
wages have failed to keep up with inflation. Since 1975, real
wages per worker have fallen more than 10% while real average
Social Security benefits per retiree have increased by nearly
20%.
   Modifying the adjustment of income-tax brackets by the
same inflation-minus-2% rule would raise the growth of tax
revenue by about the same amount that it cuts the growth of
Social Security outlays. There is also enough ambiguity in
this tax change to satisfy most politicians: The
inflation-minus-2% rule raises revenue without a tax increase
and reduces benefit outlays without lowering anyone's
benefit.
   The inflation adjustment of income-tax brackets and Social
Security benefits also provides a good way to expand the
Gramm-Rudman automatic mechanism to keep the proposed budget
declines on track. If the deficit is greater than the target
level in some future year, the traditional Gramm-Rudman
spending cuts could be supplemented by a reduced inflation
adjustment to benefits and tax brackets.
   The narrow range of budget categories that are now the
only eligible items for the Gramm-Rudman sequesters has
implied such draconian reductions in individual programs that
Congress and the administration have preferred to use phony
numbers to avoid painful real deficit reductions. Broadening
the range of automatic deficit cuts to include tax and Social
Security adjustments would make Gramm-Rudman more effective.
   President Bush has emphasized that he regards a reform of
the budget process to be an important goal of this year's
negotiations. A two-year budget cycle and some form of
enhanced rescission authority would help to make the budget
process more rational. But expanding the Gramm-Rudman
fail-safe procedure to include the inflation adjustments to
both tax brackets and Social Security benefits is the best
way to achieve declining budget deficits and to make certain
that broad and fair reductions in the growth of spending are
the centerpiece of that deficit reduction.
