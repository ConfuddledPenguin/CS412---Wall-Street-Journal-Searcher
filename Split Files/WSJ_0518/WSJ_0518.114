   While the White House and congressional representatives
dance around something called the "budget summit," a real
summit over real money is taking place on Capitol Hill. We
know this one will cut a deal because Members of Congress are
the only ones doing the dealing. It's a conference committee,
which is working out the details on supplemental
appropriations for the current fiscal year; the Senate's
version of it reached the gassy level of $3.3 billion. In
other words, Congress and various executive-branch
collaborators have discovered that last year's budget wasn't
enough; they've got to spend billions more.
   As we noted in these columns recently, a big item on the
agenda is the fact that House Members have already run
through the millions they appropriated last year to spend on
their mailings to constituents. Now a few more details have
emerged. One reason the franking account will go about $44
million into the red is that many Members plan to send out
their propaganda near the fall elections using first-class
postage. They are "forced" to do this because many of them
have already used up their quota of 10-cent, third-class
mailings.

   A House Member at the conference (which is also deciding
on a cornucopia of pork-barrel requests) told the Senators
that the House is going to undertake "reforms" of the
franked-mail system.
   We suppose it would be considered utopian to suggest that
one reform might be to build a kind of rehabilitation clinic
somewhere in Washington for compulsive spenders. Absent that,
voters can at least consider what is behind the fact that
come fall, their mailboxes will be filling up with
first-class junk mail.
