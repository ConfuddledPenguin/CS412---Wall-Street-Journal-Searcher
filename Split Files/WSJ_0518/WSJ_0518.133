   SOVIET FAILURE

   The top adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on economic reform admitted that all economic changes to date
in his country have failed and appealed to Western
economists, businessmen and governments to help out.
   "If the West would help, this would in fact make the whole
difference," Stanislav Shatalin said at a news conference
called to discuss a plan to have Western experts review
Soviet and East European economic-reform plans. He added: "We
have come to a very profound conclusion that without the
cooperation of the West, we simply can't build a market
economy."
   Mr. Shatalin noted that many Soviets oppose a market
economy and the price hikes and unemployment almost certain
to come with it. He cited a poll that he said showed 54% of
Soviets are for market reforms but 46% against them.
   Mr. Shatalin said the Soviet Union has decided, along with
other East European nations, to join a new program uniting
some 50 top experts to cull through Soviet and East European
reforms before they are implemented. The program is being run
by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
in Austria.
                                                                                                       

   A FLOP IN LONDON
                                                                                                       

   "King," a $5 million London stage musical about Martin
Luther King Jr., will close on June 2 after only six weeks.
The show's producers blamed the failure on publicity about
problems affecting the production before it opened and on bad
reviews. The Daily Mail critic said "King" had taken an
exciting subject and "driven it into the ground under the
weight of good intent." The producers said "King" was getting
nightly ovations but had only $170,000 in advance bookings.
                                                                                                       

   ASSURANCES FOR AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union has given official assurances it will pay
130 million Australian dollars (US$99 million) it owes for
Australian wool later this week or early next week, an
Australian government official said. Neal Blewett,
Australia's Trade Negotiations Minister, told parliament that
the Australian ambassador had met Soviet government officials
in Moscow Wednesday to register Australia's concern about the
delay in paying Australian wool exporters. Mr. Blewett said
the delay in payments appeared to be caused by a
reorganization of the Soviet foreign-trade system rather than
to any default.
                                                                                                       

   COLOMBIAN PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   Toyota Motor Corp. announced it would manufacture
commercial vehicles in Colombia in a joint project with a
subsidiary of France's Renault and Mitsui &amp; Co., a major
Japanese trading house. Toyota officials said their company,
Japan's biggest car maker, has signed agreements with
Sociedad de Fabrication de Automotores Renault S.A. and
Mitsui. Under the agreement, they said, Bogota-based
SOFASA-Renault will add Toyota's Land Cruiser and Hilux
models to the line of Renault cars it has been producing.
                                                                                                       

   REFORMULATING SWEDISH BEER
                                                                                                       

   Sweden's leading brewers said they would lower the alcohol
level in their strongest beer from 4.5% to 4% after the
government said it might increase taxes on alcohol and link
them to the potency of the brew. But the brewers insisted
their decision was because of taste, not taxes. "The taste is
better at a lower level," said Katrin Andersson at the
Swedish Brewers' Association. Authorities said the proposed
tax increase would cut alcohol consumption by 10%.
                                                                                                       

   FRANCE'S POLLUTION TAX
                                                                                                       

   France this month became the first nation to institute a
tax on air pollution. Under the new law, emissions of sulfur
dioxide will be charged at a rate of 150 francs ($27) per
ton. The Ministry of the Environment will collect the taxes.
Ministry officials said the revenues would be used for such
purposes as measuring and reducing air pollution, including
grants for installation of anti-pollution measures.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN TOBACCO ADS
                                                                                                       

   Britain and West Germany blocked a European Community bill
restricting tobacco ads in the press and on billboards.
   The 12 health ministers of the EC unanimously agreed on
the need to limit advertising, but opinions diverged on how
and to what extent to do it. A ban on television tobacco
advertising already exists in all member states.
   Most EC member countries were in favor of a total ban on
tobacco advertising, and some already have such a ban.
However, the German representative said banning a legal
product raised a constitutional problem, while the British
representative said he preferred a voluntary restriction
system.
   The ministers decided that the tar yield in all cigarettes
sold in Europe will be 15 milligrams by the end of 1992 and
12 milligrams by the end of 1993. The current levels range
from 15 to 20.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Members of France's National Independent Union of
Guardians and Concierges are staging a protest at the Cannes
Film Festival tomorrow and plan to burn a broom in front of
the festival center. The concierges say they are tired of
being depicted in French films as sloppily dressed gossips
leaning on a broom handle. . . . Cyprus's labor minister
advocated using National Guard soldiers as waiters and
bartenders in holiday resorts. The suggestion followed the
arrest of dozens of foreigners working illegally in the
seaside resort of Ayia Napa.
