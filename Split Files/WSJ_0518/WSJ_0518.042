   PITTSBURGH -- Mellon Bank and Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets said they established an independent corporation that
will purchase receivables from Mellon's corporate customers.
   Three Rivers Funding Corp., as the entity will be called,
will issue as much as $500 million of its commercial paper
through Merrill Lynch and use the proceeds to buy trade,
credit-card and other corporate receivables from Mellon
customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By selling receivables to Three Rivers, Mellon corporate
customers will be able to remove those receivables from their
balance sheets and finance them at commercial paper-based
rates.
   Mellon Bank is a unit of Mellon Bank Corp., a bank holding
company.
