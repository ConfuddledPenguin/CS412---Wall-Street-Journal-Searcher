   FINDLAY, Ohio -- Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. is continuing an
ambitious expansion program in spite of a recent weakening of
tire prices, Ivan W. Gorr, chairman and chief executive
officer, said.
   The expansion includes a $100 million investment to start
production at a newly purchased tire plant in Albany, Ga. The
facility will begin making tires in the second half of 1991,
he said.

   Unless discounting becomes substantially worse, Cooper
will show a profit increase again in 1990, Mr. Gorr said. He
said he doesn't expect the discounts to deepen.
   He said shareholders are likely to receive a dividend
increase this year, as they have in each of the past 10
years. Cooper's current quarterly dividend is nine cents. It
was raised from 7.5 cents last June.
   However, the earnings rise isn't likely to match the
spectacular gains of the past two years, Cooper officials
said. Cooper's profit jumped 42% in 1989 and 34% in 1988. Mr.
Gorr declined to make an earnings estimate, but some analysts
are forecasting increases of nearly 15%, bringing earnings to
the area of $3.25 a share, up from $58.2 million, or $2.84 a
share, a year earlier.
   This could be the year Cooper's sales hit $1 billion, Mr.
Gorr said, but he said such a 15% rise from last year's
$866.8 million is an ambitious target that can be achieved
only if the economy remains relatively healthy. Even if
Cooper's sales fall slightly short of $1 billion, however,
sales will have risen 50% in just three years.
   Price discounting of replacement tires began in March and
intensified in April and May, Mr. Gorr said. Based on offers
made to dealers by other tire producers, it appears that the
discounting will continue at least through July, said Patrick
W. Rooney, president of Cooper's tire division.
   The discounting appears to be the result of a decline in
sales of tires to producers of new cars, which created excess
inventories for some tire producers, Cooper officials said.
During the first four months of 1990, tire shipments to car
makers dropped by nearly 20%. And producers are trying to
sell some of those surplus tires in the replacement market,
Mr. Gorr said.
   Cooper produces only replacement tires, and "our business
has remained pretty strong," he said. Industry shipments of
replacement passenger tires in the first four months of 1990
were 3.7% higher than a year earlier. However, Cooper has to
"keep our dealers competitive" by offering price concessions,
he said.
   Cooper's tire plants are operating at near-capacity rates,
Mr. Gorr added, but overtime schedules are being reviewed in
light of market conditions.
   Cooper bought the 1.8 million-square-foot Atlanta plant in
March from Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a unit of Bridgestone
Corp. of Japan. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. closed the plant
in 1986, prior to Firestone's acquisition by Bridgestone. Mr.
Gorr declined to state the plant's purchase price, but said
it was included in the first quarter's capital spending,
which totaled $25 million.
   In addition, Cooper is expanding capacity at its three
operating tire plants in Findlay; Texarkana, Ark.; and
Tupelo, Miss., Mr. Gorr said. The company has increased tire
production capacity by 10% to 12% in the last 12 months, and
probably will add another 5% or more to capacity by year-end,
Mr. Gorr said. By the end of 1990, Cooper will have the
capacity to make at least 80,000 tires a day at those three
tire plants, he said.
   Management plans to gradually build up production at
Albany as Cooper did at the Tupelo plant, which it purchased
in 1984. Production at Tupelo began at the end of 1984 and
reached 7,000 tires a day by mid-1986. The plant's output
doubled by the end of 1987, tripled by the end of 1989 and
will rise to nearly 28,000 tires daily by the end of 1990,
officials said.
   Each expansion was completed ahead of schedule and under
budget, Cooper officials said. "We hope to repeat that at
Albany," Mr. Gorr said.
   The Albany facility also will include a highly automated
distribution center to serve Cooper's dealers and
private-label customers in the Southeast, Mr. Gorr said. He
said resulting improved service will boost Cooper's sales in
the Southeast, already a strong region for the company.
   Cooper's sales of industrial rubber products, mainly
automotive parts, declined in the first quarter because of
lower auto and truck production, but profit from industrial
products rose slightly, Mr. Gorr said. Sales currently are
running about even with a year ago, he said. "We expect
improved profits" for the year from industrial rubber
products, which account for about 20% of Cooper's sales.
   The company already supplies parts to eight of the nine
auto plants owned all or in part by Japanese concerns and has
a contract to begin supplying the ninth, Mr. Gorr said.
Rising sales to those plants partially offset lower
production by U.S. auto and truck makers, he said. Prospects
for sales to 1991 model cars "look real good," Mr. Gorr said,
with continued increases in market penetration.
   Heavy spending at Tupelo and initial outlays at Albany
will push Cooper's 1990 capital spending to about $130
million, up more than 75% from $73.2 million in 1989, said J.
Alec Reinhardt, vice president and chief financial officer.
He said spending will average about $100 million a year for
the 1990-94 period.
   Internally generated cash plus an $85 million bank credit
line will enable the company to handle 1990 spending without
long-term borrowing, Mr. Reinhardt said. However, the company
probably will do about $100 million of long-term financing
during 1991, he said, most likely a straight debt offering.
The financing might be done later this year if interest rates
decline significantly, he added.
   Debt currently is only 16% to 17% of total capital, a
conservative ratio that will permit borrowing without
jeopardizing the company's credit ratings, he said.
