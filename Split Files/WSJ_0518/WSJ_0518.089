   The Bush White House has a mind as open as the sky, so it
shouldn't surprise anyone that this week it assembled its own
Rainbow Coalition.
   To discuss a new civil rights bill (known as
Kennedy-Hawkins) George Bush met with -- take a long breath
-- liberal blacks, Hispanics (subdivided into Cubans,
Mexicans and Puerto Ricans), reform and orthodox Jews,
Asian-Americans (Japanese and Chinese but no Koreans),
Catholics, disabled, multiple women's groups and even a few
token conservatives. (Native Americans, somehow excluded,
should sue for redress.)

   Such loud public listening is often covering fire when
someone is about to abandon principle, which is what George
Bush may soon do on civil rights. That principle, affirmed
last year by the Supreme Court, is that policies of "racial
preference" are doubtful as both law and morality. Now the
civil rights establishment and some in Congress want to
topple those court judgments and preserve a racial spoils
system. A fight is on to prevent them, but principle is
likely to be snapped under the force of racial politics.
   And make no mistake, the politics is hardball. Benjamin
Hooks, the quick-to-judge head of the NAACP, walked out of
his White House meeting to declare the Kennedy-Hawkins bill a
"litmus test" of Mr. Bush's support for blacks. Mr. Hooks was
as always presuming to speak for all blacks. Arthur Fletcher,
Mr. Bush's own appointee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,
declared "a battle for the president's mind" -- as if Mr.
Bush would morally offend him if he vetoed the bill.
   Messrs. Fletcher and Hooks have allies among GOP politicos
who hope to banish the ghost of Willie Horton. The
president's approval ratings are close to 70% among blacks,
out of sight for a Republican. Some aides say accommodation
will keep those numbers high. Come 1992, Mr. Bush might
double his share of the black vote to 20%. So they --
communications aide David Demarest, for one -- arranged the
photo-op with Ben Hooks and other civil-rights liberals.
   The dissenters include a few administration conservatives,
but, more important, many blacks. Bob Woodson, the black
self-help activist, showed up Monday and asked,
impertinently, what this civil rights bill had to do with the
needs of poor blacks. Affirmative-action helps only the black
middle class, he said.
   "I don't want to see poor blacks sacrificed on the altar
of affirmative action to expand the base of the Republican
Party," Mr. Woodson said later.
   Buster Soaries, a Baptist minister, pointed out that the
student drop-out rate where he lives, in Trenton, N.J., is
53%, and most drop-outs are black. "The passage of the civil
rights bill won't affect that," he said.
   The Civil Rights Commission's Mr. Fletcher was so
flustered by these points that he dismissed the dissenters as
"superconservatives." (Remember when activists for the poor
were liberals?) Later, on the White House driveway, one of
his colleagues tried to cut Mr. Woodson off from the press by
declaring the session "closed." Earlier, the liberal civil
rights leaders had threatened to boycott the meeting with Mr.
Bush if black conservatives Thomas Sowell or Alan Keyes were
also invited. The White House bravely acquiesced.
   This debate among blacks speaks volumes. Mr. Fletcher,
like so many of Mr. Bush's black advisers, is well-to-do.
He's prospered on the federal payroll. Joshua Smith, another
influential black Republican, is a rich Maryland businessman.
A third, Thaddeus Garrett, is an upper-middle-class
Washington consultant. They all fiercely defend policies of
racial preference. Their opponents are blacks who work with
the black poor, who've learned that most of the racial spoils
go to someone else.
   Mr. Bush has at least objected to racial quotas. He may
have been impressed by Evan Kemp, his Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission chairman, who argued passionately on
Wednesday that quotas merely enshrine discrimination. Quotas
induce employers to hire the least disabled of the disabled,
or the most employable blacks, and no more. While Messrs.
Fletcher and Hooks deny that Kennedy-Hawkins contains quotas,
Mr. Kemp insists it does. But even if this quota problem is
only partly solved, most sources agree that this
split-the-difference president will be loath to veto
Kennedy-Hawkins.
   This is a shame, because Mr. Bush's goodwill among
minorities gives him a chance to shape a new and better
civil-rights consensus. That consensus would still redress
specific acts of discrimination, but bar reverse
discrimination. The current rash of racial violence, in New
York City and elsewhere, should disturb everyone. Mr. Bush
can do much to soothe it.
   But race-conscious remedies -- the quotas, "goals," and
set-asides of Mr. Hooks' agenda -- are sparks on dry tinder.
They breed condescension and complacency among whites,
resentment among blacks, and cause both to discount real
black achievement. A colorblind vision, however imperfect in
practice, is the only sustainable guiding principle for a
polyglot society.
   Listen to Buster Soaries: "The 1965 bill was a universal
civil rights bill that helped all blacks. But the Kennedy
bill is not about civil rights. It is about helping people
who have already made it. I fear it will only persuade whites
that they've done all they can for poor blacks. What we don't
need is another backlash that damages our cause."
   On civil rights, as on so much else, Washington lives in a
time warp.
