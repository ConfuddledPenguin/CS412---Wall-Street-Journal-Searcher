   BATAVIA, N.Y. -- Officials of Graham Corp., a designer and
maker of vacuum and heat-transfer equipment, told
shareholders at the annual meeting that sales this year will
increase about 18% to about $80 million from $67.8 million
last year.
   The company didn't make a specific earnings forecast, but
said it expects each of its units to be profitable.
Executives said they expect continuing strength in the
company's principal markets, including chemical and
petrochemical process industries and co-generation power.
