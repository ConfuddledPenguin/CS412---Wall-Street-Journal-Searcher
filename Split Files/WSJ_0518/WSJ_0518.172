   Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a British engineering concern,
bought Eaton Technologies of the U.S. for 38 million pounds
($63.8 million), the company said yesterday.
   The purchase of the Michigan-based electric-motors
manufacturer is the first major acquisition made by
London-based Hawker Siddeley on behalf of its International
Electric Motors Division, a unit resulting from a
restructuring of its divisions, the company said.

   The company earlier this year paid 7 million pounds for
the electric-motors division of Electrohome Ltd., a North
American motors manufacturer, and less than 10 million pounds
for Bull Electric Ltd, a U.K. elevator and lift motors maker.
The exact price paid wasn't disclosed.
   A company spokesman said the acquisition of Eaton "adds to
Hawker Siddeley's leading presence in the U.S." in electric
motors.
