   LYNCHBURG, Tenn. -- The modern world worships hustle,
energy and Beautiful People. But for 36 years, ads for Jack
Daniel's Tennessee whiskey have evoked the slow-paced life of
the rural South. And year after year, Jack Daniel's sales
stay in the fast lane.
   Before the rustic ad campaign, Jack Daniel's was just
another brand in the pack of premium U.S. whiskeys. The
campaign's success shows how a single marketing gimmick,
relentlessly pursued, can transform a product into a
marketplace fortress.
   Not many famous products pursue an old-fashioned
small-town, small-business image as consistently as Jack
Daniel's has from the days when it actually was a small-town
small business. Ironically, though, the image has given the
brand such cachet that it is now a big business -- and it is
owned by an even bigger one.
   "Lem Motlow, proprietor," reads a line under the
distillery name on the rustic-looking Jack Daniel's bottle
label. Yet the Motlow family hasn't owned the distillery
since 1956, when it sold out to Brown-Forman Corp., a
Louisville, Ky., producer of liquor and other products with
sales of more than $1 billion a year.
   But a cracker-barrel, small-business image can apparently
serve a big corporation as well as a small one. In surveys of
brand awareness, Jack Daniel's ranks first among all
distilled spirits. Among higher-priced U.S. whiskeys, no
brand comes close to Jack Daniel's in sales -- an estimated
$450 million last year. (Official sales figures aren't
released.) "It's the most profitable brand in the industry,"
says Frank Walters, research director for Impact, a
beverage-industry newsletter.
   Jack Daniel's, which Jack Daniel Distillery began making
134 years ago, has attained a seemingly impregnable
marketplace position, even in a difficult market. "These are
dog days for brown goods {liquor}, but this brand hangs in
there," says Tom Pirko, president of BevMark Inc., a Los
Angeles-based beverage-industry consultant. "They are
extraordinarily clever at implanting their message, which
taps into the American consciousness without being too
corny."
   The appeal works overseas, too. Australia, West Germany
and Japan, especially, are becoming Jack Daniel's
strongholds.
   The key to the brand's success lies in the famous ads:
unadorned, black and white photographs of Lynchburg oldtimers
killing time at the local service station, or distillery
workers on an old wooden porch. The message, also conveyed in
a few lines of homespun prose, is unambiguous. Slow is better
when it comes to whiskey making, and readers should drop by
Lynchburg and see for themselves.
   Twenty new ads are created each year. The campaign --
which began before the Brown-Forman takeover -- now runs in
about 80 magazines, with the same ad never appearing twice in
any one magazine. Brown-Forman will spend roughly $5 million
to advertise the brand this year.
   The homespun ads come straight from a St. Louis
advertising agency, Simmons, Durham &amp; Associates. But the
rustic-looking people in the photos are the real thing: Jack
Daniel's workers or Lynchburg residents.
   The rustic ads provide crucial brand identity and
differentiation. To the average palate, premium-priced
bourbons may taste pretty much the same. Still, year after
year, an overwhelmingly male customer base reaches for this
kissin' cousin to moonshine that flaunts, rather than hides,
its hillbilly origin.
   To many consumers world-wide, the squarish bottle with the
black label seems to convey the better qualities of a
vanishing America: a precomputer age when arguments were
settled over a cracker barrel, and a copper kettle and a slow
fire were a rural Southerner's idea of high tech.
   (While the spirits industry lumps Jack Daniel's with
bourbons, the company emphatically notes that the U.S.
government, for tax purposes, accepts the distillery's own
classification as a Tennessee whiskey. The difference is the
extra step Jack Daniel's takes of dripping its whiskey
through a 10-foot layer of charcoal before aging.)
   Beyond the ad campaign, Jack Daniel's works relentlessly
in Lynchburg to promote its image. Each year, between May and
September, more than 200,000 visitors travel to the tidy
village of 668 tucked into the edge of the Cumberland
Mountains, about 90 miles south of Nashville. They come to
tour the Jack Daniel's plant, laid out on 220 acres of
steeply wooded hillside. It is the nation's oldest registered
distillery, founded by Jasper Newton (Jack) Daniel in 1866.
   Slow-talking, veteran employees with a repertoire of
down-home one-liners -- "It was so dry last summer, I saw a
bush chasing a dog." -- lead groups of visitors through the
distillery's 19th-century, red-brick buildings. The guides
point out the safe that Jack Daniel allegedly kicked in a
moment of rage. He broke his toe, infection set in, and he
died of gangrene.
   Arthur Hancock, Brown-Forman executive vice president,
says the thousands of visitors who journey to Lynchburg year
after year have helped build brand loyalty. He says the
company doesn't cover up the existence of its modern,
high-speed bottling plant at the opposite end of town, or the
connection with Brown-Forman, but that visitors seem to be
seeking the Jack Daniel's portrayed in the ads.
   "The consumer isn't dumb," Mr. Hancock says. "They see
Jack Daniel's all over the world and know there's no way we
could bottle it all here in the Hollow. But they go along
with it, without thinking it's contrived."
