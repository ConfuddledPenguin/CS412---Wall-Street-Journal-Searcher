   BOGOTA -- Colombia's drug-related violence continues
unabated, and neither police, politicians nor civilians are
immune. Six children were among the 27 people killed last
weekend in a series of car bombings that took place while
crowds were shopping for Mother's Day presents in Bogota,
Cali and Medellin. In an effort to stop this madness, the
U.S. sent military aid here to help in the war against the
drug lords. The problem is, those receiving the lion's share
of the aid may be the least able to fight the battle
efficiently.
   In the aftermath of the assassination of Luis Carlos
Galan, the Liberal presidential candidate killed by the drug
lords last September, the Bush administration decided to give
$65 million to the Colombian army to fight the drug war. But
the equipment that arrived was considered "not appropriate
for drug wars" by Colombian police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez
Padilla. Indeed, the jeeps that arrived along with colored
bulletproof vests and eight helicopters -- one was sent from
Peru because it needed repairs -- were better suited to
counterinsurgency operations. Gen. Gomez Padilla reacted with
jealousy. "The drug war is a police matter," he said.

   But there was more to this than professional jeaolousy.
What was happening didn't make sense for many Colombians.
True, at one time corruption in the Colombian police forces
had reached the highest ranks. Gen. Guillermo Medina, former
chief of police, was fired by President Virgilio Barco a year
ago because it was alleged that he was being paid off by the
drug mafia after huge bank accounts were linked directly to
him.
   But Gen. Gomez Padilla, along with the chief of the
Federal Police, Gen. Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, helped to
purge corruption in the police in the past year. They have
changed almost all the high-ranking officers from the
northern part of Colombia who were under suspicion of being
paid off by the mafia.
   They were so aware of the corruption that they instituted
the "Elite Corps," a special police unit that has
successfully pursued narco-paramilitary squads at great
personal sacrifice. This unit has made many arrests and
seized record amounts of cocaine, including a 19-ton seizure
two weeks ago. During these operations, and as a result of
subsequent assassinations, 70 Elite Corps members have been
killed. In addition, the narcos tried to kill Gen. Maza twice
after he went into middle Magdalena, a region in which the
most powerful narco-paramilitary squads were based, sponsored
by the late Gonzalo Rodriguez "The Mexican" Gacha, and
trained by British and Israeli mercenaries.
   The federal and local police were doing well. So what was
the point of getting the army involved in a fight in which it
was not interested?
   "If we engaged the military in this war they would have to
prove they are not corrupt," a government official who works
with the president once told me. But what if they decide not
to prove anything? What would happen then? "They will be
fired," the official answered.
   So far, there have been no indictments of army officials
on drug-trafficking charges. But recently, President Barco
silently moved to dismiss from office four generals on
grounds that they were not tough enough against drug dealers.
   The subject of military corruption is a difficult matter
for any Colombian president. For ages, the army has made
bureaucratic advances as it moved to control the public
order. It even has autonomy over its own spending. The
police, on the other hand, are far more subject to legal
constraints.
   When rumors were first heard that the military was going
to join the fray in the drug war, some Colombian generals
said they were reluctant to participate because they were
afraid of becoming corrupt and because it would hinder the
only war they have been interested in for 30 years: the war
against several different bands of Marxist guerrillas.
   But what they didn't say was that in order to maintain
their battle against guerrillas, some members of the military
accepted money from the drug bosses, who were willing to
sponsor anti-insurgency efforts. In fact, last May, a colonel
based in the middle Magdalena was suddenly fired after
information that linked him with narco-paramilitary groups
was released to the daily newspaper for which I work, El
Espectador.
   Of course, some of the guerrilla movements have financed
their operations with drug trafficking as well. But few
generals publicly acknowledge that more recently there is an
alliance between the narcos and some big landowners. Fewer
still will admit that in some cases the army has become a
part of this relationship.
   During the past 10 years the drug mafia has bought a
tremendous amount of land, particularly in those regions
where there is a strong guerrilla presence. Today, drug
criminals own about 2.5 million acres of Colombia's 84
million acres of farm land. And their economic model,
although imposed by violent and bloody means, has lifted
important agricultural regions out of an economic depression.
   For many big landowners, the arrival of drug bosses
changed their luck. According to one such landowner, who
approached me after a 1989 seminar in Bogota: "Since the
narcos bought some farms just next to mine, our problem with
the guerrillas is over. We have been able to get back to our
farms and the development of the region is progressing."
Thus, the farmers, the newly landed narco farmers and the
army find themselves curiously aligned against the
guerrillas, who threaten all their interests.
   Certainly in today's Colombia, no institution is
completely clean. But these compromises with the army merely
accentuate the need to recognize Gen. Maza's success in
rooting out corruption and dismantling the narco-military
squads that threaten Colombia's future.
   Nevertheless, the Colombian army has better connections in
Washington than the police. Therefore, it will receive more
money than the police to fight the drug war in the next year.
The declaration of Cartagena Summit says that although the
drug war is regarded as a police matter, the problem is
getting so big that each country according to its
constitution could involve its army in the fight against
drugs. But the effect of this in Colombia is the progressive
militarization of the drug problem. Meanwhile, the
narco-violence has increased dramatically and the
anti-corruption campaign that successfully was being led by
the police has not yet become a reality within the army.
   Recently, Colombians have openly criticized the army's
involvement in the drug battle as well as the larger issue of
corruption. Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper editorialized in
favor of replacing the current defense minister (an army
officer) with a civilian. And the leading presidential
candidate, the Liberal Party's Cesar Gaviria, announced last
week: "We have to govern with a new armed forces." At such a
time, one wonders why the U.S. would choose to involve
Colombia's military in a fight it should not join. This
medicine could be worse than the disease.
