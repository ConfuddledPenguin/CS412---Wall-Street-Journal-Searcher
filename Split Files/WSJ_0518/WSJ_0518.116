   NEW YORK -- Responding to television industry worries
about the recent unexplained sharp drop in viewing levels,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. said it is considering a request by the
major networks to find a better way to measure viewing
habits.
   "We believe as a responsible organization that if someone
comes to us with a serious question about methodology, we
have the obligation of producing the best numbers possible,"
said John Dimling, executive vice-president and group
director of marketing at Nielsen, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp.

   Nielsen "now shares the grave concerns" of the TV
industry, said Nicholas Schiavone, vice-president of
marketing and sales research at NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co.
   Nielsen's data shows that TV viewing is off about 4.5%
during February and March. Such a drop, if it continues, said
an executive at CBS Inc., could result in the three networks'
losing over $300 million a year in ad revenue.
   The networks, which argue that Nielsen should have another
method of tracking ratings in addition to its people meters,
have said they would pay for the research to find such a
method.
   Nielsen's methodology is crucial when it comes to
determining advertising rates. Networks must be able to
pinpoint not only ratings, but also demographics of viewers
to specific shows. Within the next month, the so-called
"up-front" market begins, when advertisers purchase time in
advance of the 1990-91 TV season.
