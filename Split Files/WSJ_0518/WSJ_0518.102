   NEW YORK -- One of Wall Street's biggest investment banks
will soon have a new chief.
   S. Parker Gilbert, for six years chairman of Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., said he will resign at year end from the
securities firm, which has been thriving while many other
firms struggled.

   The new chairman will be Richard B. Fisher, 53 years old,
who as the firm's president has played a major role in the
firm's strategic direction in recent years.
   A big winner stands to be Robert F. Greenhill, currently
vice chairman, who is slated to be elected president. Both
men are longstanding members of management and have worked
together with Mr. Gilbert for 28 years. They said Mr.
Gilbert, 56, told them several months ago of his plans.
   The moves suggest that Morgan Stanley's recent strategy of
focusing on areas with fat profit margins will continue. The
firm's major strategic push for the 1990s centers on its
international strengths, including trading for its own
account, mergers and acquisitions, investment banking and
custodial operations.
   Despite the firm's success, Mr. Fisher said in an
interview that he expects the securities business to stay
tough for awhile.
   "Whether it's trading or financing volume or M&amp;A, we're in
one of those lull periods," he said, adding that the pressure
is intensified by Wall Street's overstaffing of as much as
25%. "It will take another six to 18 months to work through
the capacity problem."
   Mr. Gilbert's resignation surprised the New York Stock
Exchange, which had planned to nominate him as Big Board vice
chairman at the meeting of new board of directors next month.
Mr. Gilbert isn't any longer eligible to be vice chairman
because only chief executives are allowed in the post.
   A leading candidate to replace Mr. Greenhill as vice
chairman is managing director Joseph G. Fogg III, Morgan
Stanley insiders say. Mr. Greenhill and other Morgan Stanley
officials declined to comment on his successor. The firm's
board will formally vote on the changes in July.
   Morgan Stanley recently has been among the most profitable
Wall Street firms. Its return on equity currently stands at
about 27%, the largest among publicly traded investment
banks. Record trading revenue in the first quarter -- up 41%
from a year earlier -- more than offset the firm's lowest
investment banking revenue since the fourth quarter of 1987.
   The executive suite at Morgan gives little sign of Wall
Street's recession. Messrs. Gilbert, Fisher and Greenhill
received cash compensation of $5,475,000 apiece in 1989, a
24% jump from the $4,425,000 they each made in 1988.
   Mr. Greenhill, who is 53, shrugged off analysts' concerns
that Morgan made much of its money in the first quarter from
trading for its own account -- and not customary businesses
such as investment banking. "We focus on making money, not
being heroes in traditional securities businesses," he said.
   Mr. Gilbert will remain closely affiliated with the firm
as a director of Morgan Stanley Group and as chairman of its
advisory board. In a statement, he said: "The ongoing
partnership of equals between Dick and Bob in the leadership
of the firm is a powerful combination for continued
successful growth of our business around the world in the
1990s."
   A 30-year veteran at Morgan Stanley, Mr. Gilbert first
worked in marketing and corporate finance before being
elected a partner in 1969. He has been a managing director
since 1970 and a member of the firm's management committee
since it was formed in 1974. He was elected president in
1983.
   Mr. Fisher has been president for six years; before then,
he was director of the firm's capital-markets division. Mr.
Greenhill, director of Morgan Stanley's investment banking
division, was elected vice chairman last year. Each of the
two men graduated from Harvard Business School in 1962 as a
Baker Scholar with High Distinction. They have risen in the
ranks together. Both became managing directors in 1970.
   Some say Mr. Gilbert's resignation marks a turning point.
"Parker was the symbol of the old guard at Morgan," says Roy
C. Smith, professor of finance at New York University
Graduate School of Finance and a limited partner at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., noting that Mr. Gilbert's father was a partner
in the old days at Morgan. But Messrs. Fisher and Greenhill
take a different view. "After 28 years, we're pretty hard to
differentiate from the old guard," Mr. Greenhill says.
