   UDC-UNIVERSAL DEVELOPMENT Limited Partnership cut its
quarterly 29% to 50 cents a share from 70 cents, payable July
5 to stock of record June 15. Just three months ago, the
Tempe, Ariz., builder of residential communities increased
the quarterly to 70 cents a share from 60 cents, and declared
a special distribution of 50 cents a share. UDC said the
reduction reflects "increased uncertainty related to the
economy and the timing of realization of revenues from new
subdivisions, particularly those in California." UDC also
declared quarterlies of 93.75 cents a share on its Series A
preferred, and 90.625 cents a share on Series B preferred,
both payable July 5 to stock of record June 15.
