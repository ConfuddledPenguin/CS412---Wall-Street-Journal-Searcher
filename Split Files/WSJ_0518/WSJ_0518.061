   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's Riksbank, or central bank, cut its
discount rate to 11% from 12%, signaling a stabilization of
monetary policy which had tightened substantially amid a
political crisis here in mid-February.
   At that time -- with capital markets closed by a bank
strike, pressure mounting on the krona, and the minority
government paralyzed by repudiation of its economic policy --
the Riksbank took emergency action and drove up money-market
rates by 2.25 percentage points to a lofty 15.25%. In
following weeks, it kept liquidity of financial markets under
tight control with a steady stream of so-called repurchase
agreements.

   The pressure finally began to ease early last month after
a bipartisan accord on economic policy rescued the
government. Riksbank Gov. Bengt Dennis, noting that benchmark
money-market interest rates are back to levels that prevailed
before the February flap, said the discount rate had been
reduced "to show a new lower interest-rate level has been
established."
   But he warned Swedish rates would remain unusually high as
a result of continued economic imbalances -- in particular
inflation and wage increases that remain far above rates
prevailing in other industrial countries.
