   LOS ANGELES -- The former manager of Northrop Corp.'s
now-defunct Precision Products division was sentenced in
federal court here to three years in prison and fined $10,000
for his role in falsifying tests on the Air Force's
air-launched cruise missile.
   Clarence Gonsalves, 62 years old, pleaded guilty in
February to one count of conspiracy and seven counts of
making false statements. Most of the counts related to his
ordering an underling to make it appear that certain tests on
the missile were successful when they weren't.

   Los Angeles Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey said Mr.
Gonsalves's guilty plea helped force Northrop to reach a plea
agreement with the government in February. Just as opening
arguments in the criminal fraud trial against the aerospace
company were to begin, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts
of making false statements to the government in connection
with the testing of parts for the cruise missile and the
Navy's Harrier jet. The company also agreed to pay $17
million in fines.
   As part of that settlement, the Justice Department agreed
to drop 141 additional counts. It also dismissed all charges
against the two highest-ranking corporate officials
implicated in the case, divisional executives Joseph Yamron
and Leopold Engler, who were reinstated by Northrop after the
settlement. As part of the agreement, federal authorities
also closed their investigations into alleged improprieties
related to Northrop's making of MX missile parts and the B-2
bomber.

   CLARENCE GONSALVES is a former manager of the now-defunct
Western Services Department, Pomona, Calif., of Northrop
Corp.'s Precision Products division, and Howard Hyde is a
former senior engineer of the department. Recent editions
mistakenly said that the Precision Products division,
Norwood, Mass., was the unit that closed.
