   MILAN -- The Italian economy can look forward to continued
brisk economic growth and easing inflation between now and
the end of 1991, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) said.
   But the Paris-based organization issued a strong warning
that Italy's swelling government deficit and its regional
imbalances could have "damaging consequences" for the economy
in view of the approaching integration of European Community
(EC).

   The OECD predicted gross domestic product (GDP) will grow
a real or inflation-adjusted 3.2% in 1990 and 3.0% in 1991,
compared with 3.4% in 1989. Although the pace of growth is
thus expected to ease moderately from last year, the "outlook
for real economic growth between now and end 1991 remains
relatively good," the OECD said in its annual report on the
Italian economy.
   The OECD confirmed the forecast it made for the Italian
economy made in the Economic Outlook published in December.
   Inflation is expected to ease to an average of 5.5% in
1990 and to 5.2% in 1991 from 6.2% at the end of 1989. But
the 24-member organization noted the reduction probably won't
be enough to narrow the gap between the inflation rates of
its European counterparts significantly. Furthermore,
uncertainties still surround price and wage developments, the
report said. Although labor relations have improved, the
result of wage negotiations in key sectors is still unclear
and could pose a risk for inflation.
   "Despite this protracted period of expansion (between 1983
and 1989 average annual GDP growth was 3.2%), traditional
imbalances in the Italian economy have persisted," the report
said. The OECD's foremost concern is that the government
deficit has continued to grow, aggravated by the constant
increase in the cost of servicing the debt burden.
   In 1989 the cost of servicing the government debt was 9%
of GDP, while the total public debt was estimated to be about
100% of GDP.
   Although the government has set a goal of eliminating the
budget deficit net of interest payments by 1991, economists
have predicted that the current targets will be overshot if
additional budget measures aren't taken quickly.
