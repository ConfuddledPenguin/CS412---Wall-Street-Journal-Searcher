   STOCKHOLM -- AB Volvo reported a 52% plunge in
first-quarter pretax profit, continuing the steep earnings
decline that accelerated during last year's second half.
   In line with company policy, the Swedish auto maker didn't
issue a forecast for full-year profit before tax. But
industry analysts, citing a bleak outlook for both car and
truck divisions, estimated that Volvo's full-year pretax
profit probably will decline at least 35% to 4.5 billion
Swedish kronor ($748 million).

   These analysts cautioned that forecasts remain uncertain
because of several major strategic transactions made by Volvo
in recent months. It still isn't clear how those transactions
will affect this year's accounts. In a telephone interview,
the concern's new chief operating officer, Christer
Zetterberg, acknowledged: "For most people this will be an
extremely difficult year to see what Volvo is."
   But some believe 1990 could mark the bottom of Volvo's
current downturn. Positive effects of alliances with Sweden's
Procordia AB and France's Renault are expected to boost
Volvo's profit next year. And according to Mr. Zetterberg,
the heavy product development outlays that have eaten into
profitability should peak this year.
   Most of that development money has been spent on a new
Volvo car model, the successor to the company's workhorse,
20-year-old 200 series. Launch of the new car, expected next
year, looms as a crossroads for Volvo. "A recovery for Volvo
is almost totally dependent on that new model. Auto markets
probably won't get better for the next 12 months -- by which
time the new model should come. It's a crunch step," said
Philip Ayton, an auto analyst for London securities firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   Volvo said pretax profit plummeted to 1.06 billion kronor
in the first quarter, from 2.19 billion a year earlier. The
company blamed the decline on lower sales volumes, pressure
on margins in several major markets, lower rates of capacity
utilization in factories and ballooning product development
costs.
   Mr. Zetterberg said a significant part of the profit
decline -- though less than half -- was the result of higher
product development costs. He said expenditures this year
would increase from the 6.2 billion kronor Volvo spent last
year on product development -- plus an equal amount invested
in buildings and machinery.
   Mr. Zetterberg said Volvo operations also were buffeted by
a practically unprecedented, simultaneous downturn at both
its biggest divisions -- cars and trucks -- as well as in its
three biggest markets, the U.S., U.K. and Sweden. "That's
never happened before. We normally see a big difference in
cycles in those markets -- and between cars and trucks," he
said.
   The vexing market conditions were reflected in a 4%
decline in first-quarter sales, to 21.68 billion kronor from
23.07 billion the prevous year.
   During the first three months, sales at the car division,
Volvo's biggest single unit, dropped 1.1% to 42.45 billion
kronor from 42.94 billion a year earlier. (The company didn't
disclose operating profit for individual divisions.)
   The number of new Volvos delivered to customers in the
period dropped to 104,000 from 106,000 the previous year.
While unit sales of bigger, more profitable 200 and 700
series models declined 5.6%, the smaller 300 and 400 series
cars manufactured by Volvo's Netherlands-based affiliate
Volvo Car N.V. jumped 5.7%.
   Volvo said deliveries of heavy trucks declined both in
Western Europe and the U.S. and the company also lost market
share in a declining, intensely competitive U.S. truck
market. Truck division sales were about unchanged during the
first three months at 24.6 billion kronor. The total of new
heavy-duty trucks delivered skidded to 12,800 from 14,300 the
previous year.
