   French media group Havas SA announced that its
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
rose by 30% in 1989 to 975 million francs ($175.8 million)
from 751 million francs a year earlier.
   Consolidated revenue was up 20% for the year at 18.9
billion francs compared with 15.8 billion francs in 1988.
Both the revenue and the profit figures confirm preliminary
estimates that Havas released in February.

   Havas said it plans to raise its net annual dividend to
5.75 francs a share, a 39% increase from the 4.13 francs paid
out last year. It will be paid beginning July 17.
   Speaking to analysts, Havas Director of Development Michel
Boutinard-Rouelle said the company has targeted Europe as its
1990 primary growth market.
   "Europe is on the rise," he said, noting that the region
is expected to represent 28% of Havas's total investments by
1992, up from 24% in 1988. The North American share,
meanwhile, is seen falling to 51% from 55%, while investment
in the rest of the world remains fairly steady.
