   ZURICH -- Just when Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG appears on
the verge of posting a slight profit for the first time in
over four years, company management has begun worrying about
the possibility of a takeover attempt, managing director
Michael Funk said yesterday.
   "Several different raiders, some of them known to us and
some of them hidden, have expressed an interest over the past
six months in taking us over," Mr. Funk said. "As a result,
we'll have to devote more time to these takeover questions."

   Mr. Funk didn't specify the possible raiders, but said
they include foreigners as well as Swiss, and they appear
interested in buying parts of the diversified arms,
industrial and consumer products group.
   Mr. Funk, at a press conference, insisted, however, that
the company has no plans to sell off any units, adding that
such a move would only take place "at our own initiative."
   Analysts reacted with skepticism that the company, or any
of its units, might become the target of a hostile takeover
attempt, given the fact that about 45% of the company's
capital is in the hands of the Buehrle family.
   "I really don't think there's a threat of an unfriendly
takeover, because of those family shares," said Heinz Waech,
head of investment research at Zuercher Kantonalbank.
   Mr. Funk, in commenting on the outlook for 1990, said that
"thanks to substantial reductions in losses in the military
sector, and an anticipated increase in profitability at {the
consumer goods division} Bally, the whole group has budgeted
for a slight profit."
   Although company officials stressed that the profit would
likely be small, it would mark the first time since 1985 that
Oerlikon-Buehrle has operated in the black.
   In 1989, the group lost about 42 million Swiss francs
($29.9 million) compared to a loss of 35.5 million francs in
1988. The loss posted in 1989, however, was sharply narrower
than the forecast of a loss of 50 million to 100 million
francs, made by the company at a press conference last
October.
   Analysts said the company forecast for a slight profit in
1990 is within expectations, although at least one analyst
said he wouldn't be surprised if the company merely broke
even.
   At Thursday's press conference, Mr. Funk said that the
military sector would continue to operate in the red in 1990,
but didn't provide a figure. The sector lost about 100
million francs in 1989, and has lost a total of 1.1 billion
francs over the past 10 years, Mr. Funk said.
   The company said the performance of its military division
continues to be hampered by costs associated with the
development of its anti-aircraft weapons system, ADATS, which
it is developing jointly with Martin Marietta Corp. of the
U.S.
   In October, Oerlikon-Buehrle restructured its military and
industrial divisions in an effort to streamline operations,
increase competitiveness and make joint ventures in both
areas easier. The military activities are now housed under
the name Gruppe Oerlikon-Contraves, while the industrial
operations, including electronics, engineering, computers and
system technologies, are housed under the name Gruppe
Oerlikon Industrien.
   Mr. Funk said that Gruppe Oerlikon Industrien would likely
post a loss in 1990, but didn't provide a figure.
   Board Chairman Dietrich Buehrle, in the company's 1990
annual report, said the company's new structure would focus
on resorting more to joint ventures and partnerships in the
development of products, rather than going it alone.
   "The traditional approach of developing complete systems
entirely at our own risk can no longer be maintained," he
said. "The development of major systems can only be achieved
through collaboration with partners, or through common
projects within a joint venture."
   Oerlikon-Buehrle announced Thursday that its Pilatus
Aircraft unit, Switzerland's largest aerospace company, and
Beech Aircraft Corp. of the U.S. have agreed to jointly
compete for a U.S. Air Force and Navy contract for a trainer
jet. If the contract is awarded, Pilatus "will produce a
major portion of the Beech-Pilatus Trainer for Beech, with
final assembly occurring at Beech's Kansas facilities,"
according to a prepared statement released here.
