   TOKYO -- The number of corporate bankruptcies in Japan
fell to 525 in April, down 22% from 677 the year before, a
private credit research agency reported Thursday.
   But because of a substantial retrenchment in Tokyo stock
prices since the beginning of the year, the failed companies
posted heavy losses in equity holdings, bringing the total
value of their liabilities in April to 211.23 billion yen
($1.39 billion), more than double the 84.95 billion yen of
last year, Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. reported.

   According to the agency, April's decline in corporate
bankruptcies marks the 64th consecutive month of year-on-year
declines. Moreover, it said the sharp rise in the value of
liabilities marks the highest level this year and the first
time in nine months that the total has risen above 200
billion yen.
   The number of bankruptcies was up 4.4% from 503 in March,
with the value of liabilities close to triple the 73.2
billion yen of March.
   The number of bankruptcies due to losses on capital
assets, including stock and land holdings, jumped to 12 from
eight in March and only one in both January and February.
Meanwhile, the liabilities involved totaled 118.09 billion
yen, compared with 6.4 billion yen in March.
