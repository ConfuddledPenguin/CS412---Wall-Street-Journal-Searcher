   Lufthansa said that its 1989 group pretax profit climbed
7.9% to 260 million marks ($158 million) from 241 million
marks in 1988.
   The West German national air carrier, 51%-owned by the
West German government, said that group sales climbed 10% to
13.1 billion marks from 11.85 billion.

the first four months of 1990.
