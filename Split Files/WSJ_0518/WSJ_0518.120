   PITTSBURGH  --  Charles M. Thorp III, a former lawyer who
had losses of upward of $20 million on the options market,
including funds he allegedly misappropriated from clients,
was indicted on 26 counts by a federal grand jury here.
   The U.S. attorney's office here said Mr. Thorp, 49 years
old, was indicted on charges of transporting stolen funds in
interstate commerce and bank fraud. Among other things, Mr.
Thorp was charged with transporting about $2.6 million of
stolen money between Pittsburgh and Boston or New York
between April 1987 and May 1989.

   Mr. Thorp also is accused of fraudulently obtaining a
$400,000 loan from Pittsburgh National Bank by using the name
and credit of a client in April 1987. Pittsburgh National is
a unit of PNC Financial Corp.
   Mr. Thorp previously surrendered his license to practice
law.
   Neither Mr. Thorp nor his attorney could be reached for
comment. A spokeswoman at the U.S. attorney's office here
said a summons has been issued for his arrest.
   Mr. Thorp, grandson of the founder of one of this city's
law firms, was the subject of a front-page story last month
in this paper.
   He faces a maximum sentence of as much as 255 years in
prison and fines totaling $6.5 million, or both.
