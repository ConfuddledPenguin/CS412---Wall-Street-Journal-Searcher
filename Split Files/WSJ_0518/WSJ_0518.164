   Gap Inc., San Francisco, said net income increased 40% on
a 30% increase in sales in its first quarter ended May 5.
   Net rose to $21.2 million, or 60 cents a share, from $15.1
million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 30%
to $402 million. Both figures were records.

   Despite the strong quarter, investors battered the
company's stock, as analysts cut earnings estimates for the
second quarter more than 10% in some cases.
   Edward Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, said
under the Gap's accounting methods, some of the cost of
April's markdowns will be felt in the month of May, so he
reduced his estimate for second quarter per-share net seven
cents, to 51 cents.
   The Gap operates stores under its own name as well as
Banana Republic. Mr. Weller said that he believes the latter
chain, which has had difficulties lately, earned a "slight"
profit in the quarter, compared to a loss a year earlier.
