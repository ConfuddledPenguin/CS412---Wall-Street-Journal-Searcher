   PROSPECT HEIGHTS, Ill. -- Household International Inc.
faces as much as a two-notch downgrading on the debt of its
main finance unit by Moody's Investors Service Inc., but
Household said it won't curb the aggressive growth plans that
have worried the debt rating agency.
   Kenneth J.H. Pinkes, a director at Moody's, following a
meeting last week with Household's management, said the
company's big Household Finance Corp. unit's debt could be
lowered two steps from its current A-1 level.

   Moody's hasn't made a final decision on the ratings of
$9.5 billion debt of Household and its units, which has been
under review since April 12 for possible downgrading. But Mr.
Pinkes said the two-notch downgrading for HFC is now under
consideration because of the overall increase in risk in the
parent company's balance sheet.
   The parent company's debt is rated A-3 by Moody's and the
HFC unit has enjoyed a rating two notches higher because of
its relatively strong capital and earnings. However, Mr.
Pinkes said the level of risk elsewhere in the company and
the potential that HFC could be called on to help support
other operations had Moody's considering bringing the unit's
rating closer to its parent's.
   Household International has a big troubled portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, a big though currently healthy
portfolio of leveraged buy-out loans, and its level of
reserves for loan losses in all lending areas is considered
possibly inadequate by Moody's. "At the minimum, there's a
need for a greater amount of capital," Mr. Pinkes said. "At a
maximum, there's a need for additional reserving."
   No one single thing led to the debt review for possible
downgrading, Mr. Pinkes said. Rather, Household
International, under Donald C. Clark, chairman and chief
executive officer, is a company trying to do too many things
too quickly, Mr. Pinkes said.
   Mr. Clark, in an interview, said that Household
International plans to operate in coming years with more
leverage instead of less, and he insisted the company's
capital and reserves are adequate to support its aggressive
growth plan.
   "It's not as if we're telling people here's what we're
going to do and we've done miserably in the past," he said.
Household International has been consistently and highly
profitable.
   For this year's first quarter, its profit was $52.2
million, or $1.36 a share, against $55.2 million, or $1.51 a
share, a year earlier. The year-ago results include $11
million of profit from discontinued operations, and on a
continuing-operations basis first-quarter profit increased
18%.
   Household International has invested heavily in a consumer
banking operation, targeting higher-income people that its
HFC offices typically deal with. HFC is also growing rapidly.
Overall, from 1988 to 1993, Mr. Clark plans to double the
parent company's assets, which means growing 15% compounded
annually. The company's assets at March 31 were $27.75
billion.
   "I'm totally convinced it's going to be a success," Mr.
Clark said of the consumer banking operation, which has yet
to turn a profit. The business, which operates largely under
savings and loan charters, runs at a higher level of leverage
-- roughly $20 in loans to $1 in capital is Household's goal.
   But that degree is leverage without solid profits worries
Moody's. "I don't think we would be against 20-to-1 leverage
if he had superb profitability in that organization," Mr.
Pinkes said.
   Household stock has languished in recent months because of
loan-quality and debt-rating concerns. It closed yesterday at
$46.50, up 50 cents.
   Mr. Clark said the capital investments of about $300
million during the past two years will pay off in coming
years, and that the consumer banking operation, known as
Household Bank, will reach the company's goal of 15% return
on equity in about four years.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Clark expects he may have to tangle from
time to time with rating agencies. "Moody's is representing
the creditors. A credit rating agency would love every
company to have 10 times more equity than debt. It's a
professional manager's job to balance the needs of the
{stockholder} and the debt holder."
