   TOUTLE, Wash. -- How do you commemorate an eruption?
That's easy; you let off steam.
   This tiny logging town, 25 miles west of Mount St. Helens,
will pull out all the stops as it holds its traditional
Volcano Daze festival this weekend to mark today's 10th
anniversary of the eruption that caused widespread
destruction and about 60 deaths.

   Initially staged by local residents as a way of fighting
their post-disaster depression, the annual festival has
itself been a disaster of sorts in recent years, because of
apathy, high liability-insurance rates and laissez-faire
planning. Moreover, purists believe that sales of souvenirs
-- ashtrays and vials of volcanic ash, among others -- have
commercialized the event.
   "The last one was sort of an eyesore," recalls local
newspaper editor Terri Lee Grell.
   So this year, besides the chili cook-off,
chain-saw-carving contest and tacky souvenirs, organizers
have gone highbrow, bringing in five "logger poets" to read
poems of the Northwest woods. "I guess sailors like poetry,
so why not loggers," says festival volunteer Ben Benjamin.
   It isn't Tennyson, and the jargon can be a bit puzzling,
but logger poetry is more established than is generally
understood, devotees contend.
   Only college types are surprised that loggers write
poetry, says poet/logger Lon Minkler. "They didn't have
radios or TVs in the early days, so they made up their own
poetry and recited it in the woods," explains poet Woodrow
Gifford, who has published a book entitled "Timber Bind and
Logger Rhythms."
   An example of logger poetry is this verse by 84-year-old
Robert E. Swanson, a pal of the late Canadian poet and
novelist Robert Service:
                                                                                                       

   "Out in the brush with the rigging crew,
   I sit me down on a chunk.
   And I heed the call of the hooker's bawl,
   I'm an expert whistle punk."
                                                                                                       

   (A "hooker," in this instance, is a foreman on a logging
crew. A "whistle punk" is a young logger assigned to a
train.)
   Organizers aren't sure how logger poetry will go over with
the Volcano Daze crowd. But Mr. Swanson, who is coming from
Vancouver, British Columbia, to read his works, expects a
good reception. "Loggers are very human; they wear their
hearts on their sleeves," he says. "They call a spade a spade
and a log a log."
