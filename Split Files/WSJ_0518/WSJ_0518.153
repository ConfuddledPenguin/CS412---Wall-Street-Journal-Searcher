   ROCKY HILL, Conn. -- Ames Department Stores Inc., which is
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
said it named Peter Thorner executive vice president and
chief financial officer.
   Mr. Thorner, 46 years old, succeeds Duane R. Wolter, 40,
who will be leaving the company in August. A spokesman for
Ames declined to comment on the reasons for Mr. Wolter's
planned departure and said Mr. Wolter was unavailable for
comment.

   Mr. Thorner was most recently a managing director, senior
vice president and chief financial officer of Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc., Danvers, Mass.
   Ames filed for bankruptcy-law protection from its
creditors last month. Earlier this week, a bankruptcy court
judge approved Ames's request that it be allowed to receive
$250 million in interim financing from Chemical Banking
