   Interco Inc. threatened a bankruptcy-law filing in an
attempt to pressure bondholders into accepting its plan to
restructure almost $900 million in debt.
   The troubled St. Louis furniture and shoe company, which
borrowed heavily to recapitalize in late 1988, said it
doesn't intend to seek court protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code "unless the
restructuring cannot otherwise be accomplished."

   But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the
company said publicly for the first time that it viewed a
"prepackaged" Chapter 11 reorganization plan as an
"alternative method for accomplishing the restructuring."
   Bondholders have been grumbling about the plan, announced
last week. It offers little in the way of new interest-paying
bonds and, instead, relies heavily on issuing more Interco
common stock. As a result, some bondholders have suggested
they might fare better if they could push Interco into
Chapter 11.
   A company spokesman said, however, that Interco's Chapter
11 proposal involves "exactly the same offer with respect to
the terms we're offering to debenture holders and
shareholders." The only difference, he said, is that Chapter
11 requires approval by holders of two-thirds of each class
of bonds -- far fewer than the 90% needed for the debt-swap
offer.
   Moreover, he said the company's bank lenders wouldn't be
affected by the prepackaged bankruptcy filing. The banks, as
reported, are negotiating terms of an agreement that would
stretch out payments on $500 million in loans into 1992. The
banks already have extended until Oct. 1 the due date on
certain loan payments while they are in talks about amending
Interco's existing credit agreements.
   But disgruntled bondholders still could scuttle the plan.
If they fail to approve it in sufficient numbers, Interco
could still face a standard Chapter 11 filing that would
involve lengthy negotiations with all parties.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Interco shares closed unchanged at 46.9 cents each.
   Interco and its advisers, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., are believed to hope that a
prepackaged Chapter 11 filing could bring the company out of
bankruptcy-law proceedings within four months. In contrast, a
standard Chapter 11 petition could mean two years in
bankruptcy court.
   "The value of the business would almost certainly
depreciate substantially," if the company spent two years in
Chapter 11, according to one person familiar with the
restructuring. Interco makes Lane and Broyhill furniture and
Converse and Florsheim shoes.
   Interco sketched an optimistic financial picture if its
restructuring is accepted and its debt burden lightened. The
company said it could show net income of $55 million for the
year ending Feb. 29, 1992, and rising profits thereafter.
Operating cash flow -- net income plus taxes, interest and
depreciation, minus capital spending -- would cover its
interest bill by 1.67 times or better. Currently, Interco is
running losses and lacks the cash flow to service its debt.
   But Interco's projections require a lot of favorable
breaks, including steady annual sales growth of about 6%,
cost cuts of $75 million a year, and no big new
capital-spending projects. Bondholders with doubts about
Interco's prospects may decide that the restructuring plan
"isn't attractive," said Jerry Hirschberg, an analyst at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Rather than swap bonds for equity in the
post-restructuring company, bondholders may press for more
cash from Interco. Otherwise bondholders may just "strap on
the hand grenades," reject the restructuring plan and see how
they fare in a full Chapter 11 filing, said Craig Davis, an
analyst at R.D. Smith &amp; Co.
   Interco's troubles date from its 1988 recapitalization,
when it borrowed almost $2 billion to pay shareholders
special dividends in cash and securities to fend off a
takeover threat from the Rales brothers of Washington D.C.
But asset sales have taken longer and generated less cash
than the company had expected. And its operations have fallen
short of expectations.
   Interco's bonds have sunk to such low levels that the
filing threat had little impact on bond prices. Interco's 13
3/4% debentures were quoted at about 26 cents on the dollar;
its two subordinated issues were quoted at about five cents
on the dollar.
