   BOSTON -- Patrick Dolan runs an antique wholesale
dealership. Jim Miller works in a suburban Boston bank. Ricky
Troped runs a residential appraisal firm.
   The three men grew up in the Boston area. And now, two
have firm plans to leave Massachusetts, while the one is
considering leaving.

   "The quality of life here has deteriorated significantly,"
says the 35-year-old Mr. Dolan, who is planning to move to
North Carolina. His wife, Laurie, adds, "It's just too
expensive to live up here. We have two kids, and I really
wanted to stay home {with them.}" With Mrs. Dolan having
given up her job after the recent birth of their younger
child, "It's just too hard to do anything," she says.
   The Dolan's story, while somewhat extreme, illustrates how
sharply public sentiment has swung in New England as the
region's economy has slowed and state fiscal problems have
spread. Where many residents just two years ago were still
bursting with pride over the "Massachusetts Miracle" and the
presidential run of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the mood now is
one of glum resignation to a future that no longer looks
bright.
   How many other families are considering leaving is
impossible to say. There is no sign of a mass exodus from New
England; nor, demographers say, is that likely to occur even
if the region's economy remains weak.
   But there is evidence that a steady outflow of people from
the region, which temporarily slowed during the economic boom
of the mid-1980s, has resumed. While retirees continue to
sell their homes and move to warmer, less expensive regions,
the high-tech, banking and construction industries are no
longer providing jobs to attract people to New England. The
outflow of people from the Northeast picked up sharply after
mid-1988, according to George Masnick, a former professor of
Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies who now
runs a consulting service on demographic trends.
   United Van Lines, in its annual survey of interstate
migration patterns, showed outbound household shipments from
Massachusetts surging to 56.3% in 1989 from 50.7% in 1988 and
49.7% in 1987. Last year was the first time since 1980 that
Massachusetts was classified as a "high out-migration" state
-- one in which out-bound shipments were higher than 55% of
total interstate moves. In New Hampshire, which had shared in
Massachusetts' economic boom in the mid-80s, United recorded
a surge in outbound traffic, to 57.8% of the total from 51.2%
in 1988.
   Like the Dolans, Mr. Miller has just put his suburban
Boston house on the market. He's planning to move this summer
to Tucson, Ariz., where his father -- who was laid off from
two Boston-area companies in the past three years -- has
recently started a heating and air-conditioning business.
"The way the economy is going, it's just getting too
expensive to live in this state" at a time when "job
opportunities are decreasing," he says.
   Mr. Miller, who is 27 years old and has two children,
lived in Texas for several years before moving back to
Massachusetts in 1987 -- when "things were looking good"
here. "When I left Texas, everything {in Texas} was like it
is now in Massachusetts," he says.
   Most economists play down such comparisons, noting that
the Massachusetts economy is more diverse than that of
oil-dominated Texas. But there's no denying that job
opportunities -- one of the most closely watched indicators
of regional economic health -- have fallen sharply in New
England in the past couple of years.
   The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising in
New England has fallen by more than 50%, from a peak of 186
in mid-1987 to 84 in March 1990. For the nation during that
period, the help-wanted index declined far more modestly, to
139 from 153, according to the New York-based business group.
   Many New Englanders continue to believe the region's
strengths, such as its high education levels and
entrepreneurial tradition, will enable it to get back in the
economic fast lane sooner or later. But some aren't sure they
want to wait for that day to come.
   "We just seem to be stagnant here," says Mr. Troped, who
had nearly 20 appraisers working for him full-time four years
ago, and now has "only a couple." "We all think it's going to
get better; the question is whether we can hang on 'til it
does." Mr. Troped is scouting opportunities in Florida,
California and Nevada, and is "giving serious thought" to
moving to any area where prospects look brighter than in
Boston.
   "I can't remember the state being this screwed up," says
Bob Weiss, who has lived in Massachusetts for all of his 50
years. Mr. Weiss, who owns a doughnut franchise and works
part-time as a real-estate agent in a Boston suburb, cites
the state's $1 billion budget deficit, rising water bills,
insurance bills, and likely increases in state and local
taxes. "My wife is not enamored of the idea" of moving
elsewhere, says Mr. Weiss. But, "if the business climate gets
worse, I'm probably going to sell my business anyway."
   Others even perceive reflections of the economic slump in
the region's cultural scene. "I do feel that Boston is drying
up -- creatively," says Susan Slovinsky, a 40-year-old
graphic designer from Needham, Mass. Ms. Slovinsky, Mr.
Troped's cousin, is planning to move to Santa Fe, N.M., for a
couple of years, because "now it seems that the newer ideas
-- let's say, in design -- are coming more from Southern
areas than Northern areas."
   Mr. Masnick, the demographic consultant, says most
out-migration comes from retirees and young people who
haven't yet started families. And it does seem clear that
more young people these days are deciding Massachusetts is
not an attractive place to launch a career and start saving
for a home, he says. Families such as the Dolans, Millers and
Tropeds are likely to remain a relatively small part of the
flow, he says.
   But Mr. Masnick's own story suggests that such people
aren't simply alarmists or escapists. Mr. Masnick and his
wife, their houses in suburban Boston and in New Hampshire
having appreciated "far beyond our expectations," sold out
and moved to Montana with their baby in 1987.
