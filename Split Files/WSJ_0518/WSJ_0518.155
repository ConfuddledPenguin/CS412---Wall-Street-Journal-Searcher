   Lomas &amp; Nettleton Mortgage Investors said it reached new
agreements with holders of $370 million in notes that call
for it to begin payments on the debt on July 31 while
extending the maturities to early 1993 from 1991.
   The Dallas company also said it plans to skip its August
dividend payment, but expects to resume regular quarterly
dividends in November. The company, which pays a dividend
based on its earnings, already has declared a 21
cents-a-share quarterly dividend to be paid May 25 to stock
of record last Monday.

   The mortgage real estate investment trust said that the
new debt agreements allow it to synchronize debt-amortization
payments with its expected cash flows from its investment
portfolio.
   It said that $220 million of notes owed to institutional
investors were to come due in full on Feb. 1, 1991, and the
remaining $150 million of revolving notes matured on Oct. 25,
1991. Under the new agreements, both issues of notes will
mature on Jan. 31, 1993.
