   BRUSSELS -- The usually unaggressive Brussels stock
exchange and a handful of Belgian and international news
groups have clashed in recent weeks over just whose job it is
to get the facts out.
   News groups, including Reuters Ltd., say the little Bourse
de Bruxelles is seeking to act as a monopoly, violating
European Community competition rules and principles of press
freedom. Reuters is a unit of London-based Reuters Holdings
PLC.

   The Brussels exchange, meanwhile, says it is protecting
the integrity of the Belgian market, ensuring a fair and
orderly playing field for all participants.
   In the latest development in the controversy, the Belgian
Finance Ministry said yesterday that the government is
reviewing the proposals in response to complaints by the
media. The government plans to issue a report in two weeks.
   The squabble in Belgium, not traditionally a leader in EC
financial markets, could be a trial run for a much bigger
battle as 12 Community stock exchanges move to form an
EC-wide trading system.
   At stake is who controls the information investors see and
when they see it.
   If the Belgian bourse has its way, it will become a
clearinghouse for news about companies, receiving
market-affecting corporate announcements before the news
groups, and then distributing them to market participants
through a bourse-operated information system.
   News groups, like other market watchers, would have access
to the announcements by subscribing to a bourse computer data
service, for what exchange officials say will be a reasonable
fee.
   The news groups are crying foul. In an 18-page letter sent
last week to the Belgian government, Reuters and several
Belgian news organizations complained that giving the bourse
such a role would go against the spirit and letter of EC laws
on transparency and competition.
   Moreover, many don't trust the Brussels bourse to get the
company information to the public quickly and without risk of
insider trading.
   "This could institutionalize insider trading," said Herman
Smedts, manager of electronic information at the electronic
publishing arm of Flemish language financial daily De
Financieel Ekonomische de Tijd.
   Even if the bourse could process the information smoothly
and quickly, the disclosure first to subscribers of the stock
market data service would discriminate against foreigners or
institutions who aren't regular market participants, Mr.
Smedts and others said.
   Bourse officials, however, say their way would prevent
insider trading by giving the bourse a chance to suspend
trading in a share before the information is released.
   Also, they say, by timing the release of news to
after-bourse hours, the bourse could assure small investors
will see reports in newspapers the next day, and be able to
act with the same information as market professionals.
   "We are mainly concerned that information gets to all
people at the same time," said Jean Peterbroek, chairman of
the Commission of the Bourse and of a leading Brussels
brokerage firm,, Peterbroek van Campenhout et Cie.
   Money, for the news groups and the bourse, is also at
stake. The bourse, a nonprofit corporation, recently set up a
company called SA Bourse-Data-Beurs NV (BDB) to sell data.
The news groups say by channeling information to its fully
owned subsidiary, the bourse is giving BDB a monopoly.
   The real purpose of BDB, they say, is to pay for the
computer trading system the Brussels bourse bought in 1988.
   Bourse officials don't deny they intend to offset their
costs through BDB, but say they are not out to gouge
subscribers either.
