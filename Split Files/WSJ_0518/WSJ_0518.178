   NEW YORK -- Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "Au Moulin de la
Galette" became the second most-expensive artwork ever sold
last night when it was purchased by an unidentified bidder
for $78.1 million.
   However, the art auction at Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
provided some evidence that the market for impressionist and
modern paintings, particularly for lesser artworks, has
topped out.

   A clear two-tiered market emerged with sky's-the-limit
bidding for blue-chip artworks from museums or famous
collectors and lackluster bidding for other works.
   The record price for an artwork is $82.5 million, set
earlier this week by the sale of Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait
of Dr. Gachet" at Christie's International PLC's major spring
art sale here. The van Gogh was purchased by a Japanese
businessman, Ryoei Saito, through a Tokyo gallery.
   Last night's Sotheby's sale raised $287 million, just
below the firm's highest presale estimate of $289 million and
the highest the firm has ever achieved for one sale. Of 70
artworks, all but nine sold, but 17 sold near or below their
presale estimates, a trend that has taken hold this auction
season.
   The auction was the last major sale of the two-week spring
auction season, which, along with similar sales later in
London, usually set the tone for the overall art market for
the next six months.
   The mood of the sale room was businesslike, lacking the
excitement and sometimes near-hysteria of recent years.
   One collector who purchased paintings at Christie's and
Sotheby's this week said overall bidding was active but
rarely spirited, with two potential buyers rather than
several, vying for many of the pieces.
   An unsuccessful bidder in the audience called the evening
the impressionist market's "swan song."
   Some works by such artists as Pierre Bonnard and Alfred
Sisley, who were considered the lesser impressionists, failed
to sell. A notable exception to the weakening trend were
three masterworks being sold by the Guggenheim Museum.
   "The shakeout is here," said Peter H. Davidson, a New York
dealer of U.S. paintings. "You have a clear sense that the
great things will sell, and the garbage won't." He added that
he expects the trend to carry over into the sales of U.S.
paintings next week, and, to some degree, to other sectors of
the art market. The torrid rate of appreciation of
impressionist works "is the thing that's been carrying" the
market, he said.
   The Renoir, painted in 1876, shows red-cheeked French
couples laughing and flirting in a Parisian dance hall. It
had been estimated to sell for $40 million to $50 million. A
version of it is prominently featured in H.W. Janson's
"History of Art," the leading art history textbook.
Considered one of Renoir's finest, it has been frequently
reproduced on posters and postcards. A second version of the
painting, which was executed at the height of the
impressionist movement, hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
