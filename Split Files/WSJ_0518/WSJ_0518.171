   Management of Armstrong World Industries Inc., a
Lancaster, Pa., building products concern, won three of the
four board seats contested at the April 30 annual meeting,
according to the final tally of proxy votes cast. Of its
dissident slate, the Belzberg family of Canada, which owns
about 11.5% of Armstrong, won one seat.
   Of the 155 million votes cast, board nominees received
about 105 million votes and Belzberg nominees about 50
million. Under the cumulative voting system, holders got four
votes a share to allocate any way they chose, including
leaving them to the proxy solicitor's discretion. Management
chose to cumulate its proxy votes to re-elect three
directors: Barbara Hackman Franklin, president of Franklin
Associates, a management consulting firm; Joseph L. Jones,
retired Armstrong chairman and president; and Robert F.
Patton, retired Integra Financial Corp. vice chairman. The
Belzbergs cumulated their votes to elect Michael C. Jensen, a
professor at Harvard Business School.
