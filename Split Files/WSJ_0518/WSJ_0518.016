   LONDON -- The public sector borrowing requirement, the
most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or
surplus, showed a deficit of #2.12 billion ($3.56 billion) in
April compared with a deficit of #1.73 billion in March and a
surplus of #890 million in April 1989, the British Treasury
said.
   Market expectations had been for a deficit of about #1.25
billion. The government is projecting a surplus for the year
ending March 31, 1991, of #7 billion.
