   Helm Resources Inc., Greenwich, Conn., said it completed a
public sale of a 500,000-share stake in Seitel Inc. for about
$4.6 million, or $10.25 a share, reducing its Seitel stake to
33%.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used partly to buy back
24,870 shares of preferred stock. The company also said it
would pay interest in cash on its debentures that are due in
1994 rather than through the issuance of common stock, which
had been the practice since 1982.
