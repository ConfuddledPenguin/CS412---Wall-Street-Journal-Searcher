   LONDON -- Eight senior and mid-level officials defected
from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's London advertising agency in another
blow for the troubled communications giant.
   The advertising managers' move to form their own shop is
the biggest defection ever from Britain's largest agency,
Saatchi's flagship. Their exit follows the apparently
unrelated ouster of two top corporate executives and a
third's resignation earlier this month.

   No clients immediately followed the defectors, who claim
they were responsible for about #72 million ($121 million) or
20% of the agency's annual billings. Saatchi said it won't
replace the eight officials and dismissed their departure as
"unlikely to have any material effect on the group's
results." Sniffed Charles Cook, a Saatchi spokesman: "This is
rather a storm in a teacup."
   But London investors reacted badly amid fears of possible
client losses and a wider exodus from the profitable,
award-winning agency, set up by company founders Charles and
Maurice Saatchi in 1970. Saatchi's share price slipped 4.5
pence to 96.5 pence ($1.62) in late trading yesterday while
London's Stock Exchange roared ahead 63.3 points for its best
day since November 1987. Saatchi shares were down as much as
nine pence at one point.
   The London ad agency "has been a beacon of light and hope
for future recovery when there were problems elsewhere" in
Saatchi, observed David Forster, an advertising analyst at
Kleinwort Benson Securities. But when "your top creative and
account people start to leave on an unplanned basis, you
start to get concerned." He said that the defections could be
the beginning of a wave of resignations.
   The defection was led by Paul Cowan, a group account
director. Among the others leaving to form a new agency,
Cowan, Kemsley, Taylor Ltd., were Adrian Kemsley, Maggie
Taylor, and Charlie Makin.
   Ironically, investors reacted favorably when three top
Saatchi executives left earlier this month. Those departures
were seen as a clear victory for Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a
French executive brought in to clean up the beleaguered
company last January. Saatchi currently is saddled with heavy
debt and is trying to get out of its disastrous foray into
the consulting business.
   Two weeks ago, the new chief executive fired Roy Warman
and Terry Bannister, who had served as joint chief executives
of the company's advertising operations. Many ad industry
watchers had doubted that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus could wrest power
from the Saatchi brothers and their cadre of loyalists, such
as Messrs. Warman and Bannister.
   Confirmation of Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's strong grip came
earlier this week when John Sharkey resigned as deputy
chairman of Saatchi's international advertising operations.
Mr. Sharkey was viewed as an ally of Mr. Warman and Mr.
Bannister. Mr. Sharkey, who declined to comment yesterday, is
to become chairman of U.K. operations for the French
advertising and marketing-services group BDDP.
   Messrs. Warman and Bannister haven't decided what to do
next. A termination agreement they are negotiating with
Saatchi probably will keep them from joining their
ex-colleagues' new agency, said Mr. Cowan. Still, "they are
our friends and we will keep in touch," he said, having to
shout over the noise of sawing wood and pounding hammers in
his new office.
   Mr. Bannister said he and Mr. Warman aren't involved in
the defectors' plans. "Despite obviously being very friendly
with the people, there's no involvement either current or
potential," Mr. Bannister said.
   Mr. Cowan, a 12-year Saatchi veteran, was passed over for
a key promotion after a reorganization of Saatchi's London
agency earlier this year. But he insisted that isn't why he
jumped ship. "This plan goes back a long way" before the
reorganization. He said he and the seven others, four of whom
were Saatchi agency board members, disliked the corporate
culture that evolved as Saatchi expanded world-wide and then
fell on hard times. The parent company's "focus should be on
advertising" again, Mr. Cowan said, "rather than on money."
   The group claims it won #15 million in new ad business for
Saatchi over the past two years. "They have brought in a
reasonable amount of new business," said Michael Savage, an
advertising analyst at Sheppards, a U.K. brokerage firm.
Investors think "if they go out the door, the business will
follow."
   As of noon yesterday, however, Mr. Cowan's new agency had
yet to land its first client. And Saatchi officials believe
the defections will cost the agency few, if any, of its
roughly 300 clients.
   Britain's Chamber of Coal Traders "will continue to carry
on with Saatchi," said Brian Tasker, director of a trade
group that spends #2 million a year on advertising. "We tend
to employ firms, not people."
   But Mr. Tasker said he hadn't discussed the issue with his
colleagues, and the ex-Saatchi agency officials "handled our
account as such." The coal group's last campaign, featuring a
dog, a cat and a mouse cuddling before a fireplace, won
numerous ad-industry awards.
   Saatchi's latest turmoil occurs in an agency where the
Saatchi brothers made their reputation by developing simple,
provocative ads. Their 1971 print ad promoting contraception,
for example, showed a pregnant man and asked: "Would you be
more careful if it was you who got pregnant?"

   Lintas Wins Sara Lee
                                                                                                       

   Lintas got a new-business boost, winning the $55 million
ad account from Sara Lee Corp.
   Sara Lee named Lintas, a unit of Interpublic Group, to
direct its entire marketing communications budget. Sara Lee
said the total program, which includes the $55 million ad
budget, tops $100 million.
   Lintas picks up ad responsibilities for most Sara Lee
brands, including its namesake cakes and pastries, Hillshire
Farm, Ball Park, Mr. Turkey and Grillmaster.
   Sara Lee, based in Chicago, previously employed a number
of different ad agencies for its many brands. Among the
losers: Chiat/Day/Mojo; Ally & Gargano; Jordan, McGrath, Case
& Taylor; and W.B. Doner. Those agencies participated in a
pitch for the combined business, as did some outsiders,
including Bozell and Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi unit. Backer pulled out of the pitch, citing a
"renewed commitment" to its client, CPC International.
   "Having our advertising and marketing communications needs
under one roof can help us extend and leverage our brands,
producing greater effectiveness," said Paul Fulton, president
of Sara Lee, in a statement.
   The win comes as a much-needed shot in the arm to Lintas,
which last week lost the $45 million Eastern Airlines account
to Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
   "Everybody here is absolutely delighted," said Spencer
Plavoukos, chairman and chief executive at Lintas's New York
operations. "Tomorrow we're going to be eating an awful lot
of cold cuts and Sara Lee pastry."
