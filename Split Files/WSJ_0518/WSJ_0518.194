   Meredith Corp. said it plans to take pretax charges
totaling $64 million for its fourth quarter ending June 30 to
cover the write-down of certain assets and a loss from the
planned sale of a unit.
   The Des Moines, Iowa, publishing and broadcasting concern
also said it no longer expects to close the planned sale of
its commercial-printing interests before the end of the
fiscal year.

   That sale, which is expected to provide a big one-time
gain, has been stalled by a lengthy review by federal
antitrust regulators. While the company reiterated earlier
statements that it's confident that the sale will be allowed
to go forward, the delay deprives Meredith of a means to at
least partially offset in this quarter the big charges it
plans.
   The company says the effect of the write-downs will be to
lower fourth-quarter results by $50 million, or $2.68 a
share. In the year-ago quarter, the company had net income of
$7.4 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $208.9
million. Through the first nine months of this fiscal year,
the company's earnings have slipped 9% to $23.5 million, or
$1.27 a share, on revenue that rose 4% to $606.7 million.
   Meredith's $29 million charge to discontinued operations,
in part, covers the planned sale to a management group of the
company's MMT Sales Inc. television-advertising operation.
The previously announced sale is part of a company effort to
focus more attention on its core operations, said a
spokesman.
   Meredith publishes Ladies Home Journal, Better Homes and
Gardens, and a raft of other home- and craft-oriented
publications.
   The company said it is also writing down its investment in
two real estate brokerage concerns with the intention of
discontinuing investments in these areas. The two concerns
are Fox &amp; Carskadon Inc., which is 95%-owned by Meredith, and
Joseph J. Murphy Inc., in which Meredith holds a 50% stake.
   The remaining $35 million charge relates to the write-down
of some company assets. Meredith said it is marking down the
value of syndicated television programming purchased by its
seven television stations, to "reflect the reduction in the
earnings power" of the investments. The charge also includes
an undisclosed amount Meredith said it is setting aside for
"contingency reserves," but the company declined to
elaborate.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., responding to Meredith's move,
affirmed its preliminary triple-B rating on Meredith's senior
debt securities, filed in a shelf registration.
   In late 1989, Meredith and members of West Germany's Burda
family agreed to sell their commercial-printing operation to
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. for $487.5 million. Meredith
originally expected to receive its shares of the proceeds
early this year.
