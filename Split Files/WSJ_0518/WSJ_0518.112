   The relationship between John A. Mulheren Jr. and Ivan F.
Boesky was described as a "two-way street of mutual
advantage" by the prosecution at Mr. Mulheren's fraud and
conspiracy trial in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott Gilbert told a jury of
seven women and five men that Mr. Boesky, the convicted
former stock speculator, provided Mr. Mulheren with "valuable
information." In return, Mr. Gilbert said, Mr. Mulheren
helped Mr. Boesky commit crimes. Mr. Boesky is expected to be
the government's principal witness.

   In opening arguments, Thomas Puccio, Mr. Mulheren's
lawyer, countered that Mr. Boesky has "manipulated people,
he's manipulated the government, and he will attempt to
manipulate" the jury.
   Mr. Mulheren, 40 years old, is charged with 41 counts of
conspiracy, mail fraud and securities fraud for crimes he
allegedly committed with Mr. Boesky in 1985 and 1986. The
government claims that Mr. Mulheren "parked" stock for Mr.
Boesky. Parking occurs when an investor sells securities with
the understanding that they will be repurchased, usually at a
prearranged time and price.
   Prosecutors allege that Mr. Mulheren used the tactic to
conceal the true ownership of the parked securities and to
help Mr. Boesky evade taxes and avoid net capital
requirements for broker-dealers.
   Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader for Jamie
Securities Co., Mr. Mulheren's defunct securities firm, is
charged with two counts of conspiracy and fraud. Mr. Gilbert
said Mr. DeStefano was the "scorekeeper" who kept "chit
sheets" that enabled Mr. Boesky and Mr. Mulheren to keep
track of how much each was owed and to hide their scheme from
the government.
   Mr. Gilbert told jurors they would hear from witnesses
including Mr. Boesky and his former chief trader, Michael
Davidoff. Mr. Boesky has completed a three-year prison term
and agreed to pay $100 million in fines. Mr. Davidoff pleaded
guilty to one felony count. Mr. Gilbert said Edward Harvey, a
former partner of Mr. Mulheren's, would testify that Mr.
Mulheren held stock for Mr. Boesky.
   Arguing on behalf of Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Puccio, a partner
in the New York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy,
said his client never believed he was doing anything wrong or
illegal in his dealings with Mr. Boesky, once a close
personal friend. "It's what's in Mr. Mulheren's mind that
really counts," Mr. Puccio said, as his sportily attired
client looked on. Mr. Puccio told the jury "accommodations"
are part of the business of Wall Street. He said evidence
would show that when Mr. Mulheren did anyone a favor it was
"legal and he believed it to be legal."
   Thomas Fitzpatrick, the New York lawyer representing Mr.
DeStefano, told jurors that his client is simply a pawn in a
high-stakes battle. "In every war, innocent non-combatants
get caught up in the crossfire," he said.
   Mr. Fitzpatrick described Mr. DeStefano as a "clerk" who
filled out trading tickets and took orders from Mr. Mulheren
without asking questions.

   INVENTOR WINS $102 million in California trade-secrets
case.
   A Superior Court jury in San Mateo, Calif., granted $83
million in compensatory damages and $19 million in punitive
damages to Dr. Agnostis Zachariades, owner of Polteco Inc., a
research and development laboratory in Alameda, Calif.
   The jury found Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, a unit of
London-based Smith &amp; Nephew PLC, guilty of fraud, breach of
contract and theft of trade secrets. The award is believed to
be among the largest ever in a trade-secrets case.
   The technology developed and patented by Polteco enhances
the durability of plastics used in artificial hips and knees.
In 1987, Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, of Memphis, Tenn., entered
into a contract with Polteco to incorporate the strengthened
plastic into its orthopedic implants. Smith &amp; Nephew
terminated the agreement in 1988, claiming Polteco's product
didn't satisfy the requirements of the contract.
   The jury determined Polteco proved its improved plastic
worked and that Smith &amp; Nephew breached the agreement and
fraudulently sought to keep Polteco from selling the new
technology elsewhere.
   Marla Stark, a lawyer with the Palo Alto office of Brown &amp;
Bain of Phoenix, Ariz., which represented Dr. Zachariades,
said the jury's verdict "confirms society's general
inclination to reward inventors and to prevent companies from
misusing their technologies."
   If affirmed by a higher court, the case could open the way
to larger damage awards for breach of contracts with
termination clauses, according to Michael Ladra, an
intellectual-property expert at the Palo Alto law firm of
Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati. In this case, damages
were calculated based on the 17-year life of the Polteco
patent even though the contract contained a provision for
termination by either party on 60-days notice.
   A Smith &amp; Nephew spokesman called the verdict "a
miscarriage of justice" and said the company would appeal.
   Judge Thomas McGinn Smith hasn't decided whether to award
$25 million in additional damages for willful and malicious
misappropriation of trade secrets.

   FUJI PHOTO FILM unit pleads guilty to making illegal
campaign donation.
   Fuji Medical Systems USA Inc., the unit of Japan's Fuji
Photo Film Co., pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge in
federal court in White Plains, N.Y. The charge involved the
donation of $7,400 to the unsuccessful 1988 re-election
campaign of Joseph DioGaurdi, a former Republican congressman
from New York.
   Richard Lawler, a lawyer for Fuji Medical, said the
company violated the law by reimbursing four of its
executives who contributed to the campaign. Companies are
barred from contributing to political campaigns.
   "It was an inadvertent mistake and it won't happen again,"
he said.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which prosecuted
the case, said the company could face a maximum fine of
$200,000. Sentencing hasn't been set.

   THREE LARGE LAW FIRMS negotiate to form venture in Europe
and New York.
   Hogan &amp; Hartson of Washington, D.C., Hale &amp; Dorr of Boston
and Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison of San Francisco would open
offices in New York and London this summer and Brussels by
the end of the year to jointly serve corporate clients. The
new entity would be named Brobeck, Hale &amp; Hogan
International.
   Several U.S. law firms have affiliations with European
firms to expand their reach abroad. This proposal, first
reported in the Recorder, a San Francisco legal trade
publication, would be the first such arrangement among
domestic firms.
   Hale &amp; Dorr and Brobeck Phleger have large hi-tech
practices. Hogan &amp; Hartson has expertise in international
trade and government regulation. The three firms "have very
complementary strengths," said John Larson, Brobeck Phleger's
managing partner.
   All three firms said a joint venture would offer the
advantages of pooled resources without the risk and
difficulty of a full-blown merger. But key details --
including compensation, management questions and potential
conflicts -- are still being ironed out. The three firms
belong to a national referral network of eight regional law
firms, none of which has an office in New York or Europe.
   If the idea plan succeeds, said Mr. Larson, combined
offices may also be opened in Germany and Japan.

   ARKANSAS IS TOLD to pre-clear election guidelines with
Justice Department.
   In the second stage of a suit alleging bias against blacks
in Arkansas elections, a panel of federal judges on Wednesday
ordered the state to seek Justice Department approval before
implementing any changes in its rules governing majority
votes in state and local elections.
   Arkansas had been the only southern state that wasn't
required to seek such Justice Department clearance, according
to Penda Hair, staff attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund. Other states were subject to the
pre-clearance requirement by the federal Voting Rights Act.
   The ruling marked the second win for the defense fund in
the Arkansas suit. In December the panel of judges ordered
the state to redraft state legislative districts in
southeastern Arkansas to make it easier to elect black
representatives.
   Elections in the newly drawn districts are slated for
later this month.

   MOST CHARGES against Leona Helmsley are dropped in New
York state case.
   In state court in Manhattan, Justice John Bradley threw
out 180 of the 188 charges against Mrs. Helmsley. Justice
Bradley said she couldn't be tried on the counts because they
are essentially the same as the ones on which she was
convicted in federal court in August. Mrs. Helmsley, head of
the Helmsley hotel empire, was sentenced to four years in
prison and fined $7.2 million for tax evasion in the federal
case, which she is appealing.
   Nathan Dershowitz, a lawyer for Mrs. Helmsley, said Judge
Bradley "eliminated the heart of the case, and we fully
believe she will be vindicated on the remaining eight
counts."
   A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general said the
remaining charges are serious and involve omissions or
falsifications on tax forms. The spokeswoman said the state
hasn't decided whether to appeal Justice Bradley's decision.

   UPI WINS ROUND in battle with Reuters over
picture-contract dispute.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals approved a
preliminary injunction sought by United Press International
to prohibit Reuters Holdings PLC from breaking a contract to
provide international news photos to UPI. The decision
reverses a lower court judge who denied the injunction.
   The appeals panel said the lower court judge was wrong to
conclude that UPI, a subsidiary of Infotechnology Inc.,
wouldn't suffer irreparable harm if Reuters were allowed to
break the contract. The appeals court cited evidence that
some of UPI's customers indicated they will immediately drop
subscriptions to the news service if it can't provide the
photos.
   Financial difficulties prompted UPI to sell the foreign
news-picture service to Reuters in 1984. As part of that
transaction, Reuters agreed to furnish foreign news photos to
UPI, and UPI was to provide Reuters with photos from the U.S.
In 1989, Reuters told UPI it was dissatisfied with the photos
from the U.S.
   UPI sought the injunction when Reuters sued to terminate
the agreement a few weeks ago.
