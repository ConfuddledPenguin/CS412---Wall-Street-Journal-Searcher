   BUCHAREST -- The spectacular December upheaval blasted
away the top of the pyramid of Romania's Communist
dictatorship, but most of that massive structure stands
intact. Five months later, Ion Iliescu's National Salvation
Front, the engineer of the alteration, wants popular
endorsement for the project. Even the Front's foes think it
will get it.
   The students who have been holding rallies on University
Square demand the acceptance of Article 8 of the Timisoara
declaration -- which would bar most of the Front, as former
Communists, from politics for six years. But the students
seem to be playing into Mr. Iliescu's hands. He has called
them "hooligans" and has not yielded in any way to their
demands to postpone Sunday's national elections.

   The Front spokesman, Adrian Nastase, claims protesters are
trying to "invalidate" the election results before the
election. Thus, he insists, they are violating the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. He also casts a few warning
words at Romanian television, controlled by the state, for
allowing itself to be "manipulated" by the students. He
regards the Front's willingness to give the students a
"speakers' corner" as a generous gesture.
   Generosity has its limits, particularly in the provinces,
out of range of most of the world press. Ion Ratiu, the
septuagenarian presidential candidate of the "rejuvenated"
Peasants Party, and Radu Campeanu, the somewhat younger
prospect of the Liberal Party, repeatedly ran for their lives
when Frontists in Tirgu Mures, Ordea and Braila physically
dispersed their audiences. The two have returned from many
years of self-exile in the West to lead the two parties that
are the main -- though apparently distant -- challengers
among the more than 80 groups taking on the Front.
   Mr. Nastase frowns on such incidents but asserts that the
culprits "act in their own capacity as private citizens" and
that the Front also has been hassled. Washing its hands of
such "police problems," it blames the murdered dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu and his predecessors back to 1938 for
having suppressed self-expression for too long.
   The Peasant and Liberal parties believe that the
international team of observers is too small to prevent
manipulation of the election results. That is plausible. But
risk of manipulation could be academic if the Front is as far
ahead as everyone seems to think. It has successfully
portrayed itself as Romania's savior.
   A less lofty purpose is beginning to emerge, however.
Romania Libera, an independent Bucharest daily, claims that a
transcript of a Front meeting shows the Front had been
preparing a takeover for at least six months before the
December explosion. Minutes after the Ceausescus fled, Petre
Roman, the current prime minister, was at party headquarters
-- to be joined shortly by Mr. Iliescu, Nicolae Miliearu, the
Front's first defense minister, Victor Stanculescu, the
current defense minister, and at least five others who were
to play a role in the Front. Diplomats say the Front's
18-point proclamation was too sophisticated to have been
produced on the spur of the moment. The Front was in touch
with the Soviet Embassy during the crisis, Romania Libera
claims.
   The Front's sincerity is also called into question by its
initial declaration that it would set up only a transitional
government and would not transform itself into a political
party. When it did, some supporters quit and nonstop protests
and hunger strikes began. In the wake of the Tirgu Mures
clashes between Transylvanian Hungarians and Romanians, the
Front ordered up a fact-finding committee. But it lost no
time in accusing the Hungarian government and travelers from
Hungary of having provoked the incidents.
   The most telling indictment of the regime, however, is the
fact that refugees are once again pouring out of Romania. The
flow had practically stopped in the first two months
following the fall of the Ceausescus. The average daily
number of arrivals in Hungary since mid-March has been 400 to
500. Austrian camps are jammed, so Austria has closed its
borders to Romanian refugees. The reasons for the flood
include the feeling in Romania that political intolerance
will intensify, exploitation of tensions among nationalities
will increase and the economy will weaken.
   Telephone taps have resumed, diplomats and politicians
swear. Literature once again is confiscated at the borders. A
guard who takes some of my historical reference books into
custody states that while it isn't illegal to bring them to
Romania, "it is inadvisable to do so now. In better times
this will not be necessary." So much for Prime Minister
Roman's ceremonious endorsement of the Helsinki document that
refers to the "free flow of ideas."
   The apparatus of repression is still intact. The
Securitate operates within the military under a new name,
Siguranta. The political police and the armed forces became
part of the Front's government as early as December,
according to a diplomatic veteran in Bucharest. The students'
suspicions about Front claims that "communism in Romania died
forever" seem well placed.
   Front nationalities policies fall short of the hopes its
rhetoric raised in December. Romania's rulers, like all
beleaguered regimes, continue to need what the Bucharest
diplomat calls an "enemy element" to serve as a distraction
from political and economic ills. In Romania, the more than
two million Transylvanian Hungarians fill most of this role.
In the wake of what they thought was their revolution too,
they proposed the restoration of their historic university in
Cluj along with the resumption of teaching in their mother
tongue in public schools. The response to such requests
included the formation of Vatra Romanesca, an
ultra-nationalist Romanian movement.
   Vasile Aileni, a vice president and council director of
the Front, says Vatra reflects Romanians' sensitivity over
Transylvania, which has been part of Romania since the end of
the first World War (except between 1940 and 1945 -- when
much of the province was annexed to Hungary). Hungary had
ruled the region for about a millennium. "Every country needs
a common language," he says. "And in Romania, the common
language is Romanian. If a Hungarian wants to study in his
language, he can go to Budapest, since everyone now has a
passport."
   To be sure, some things have improved. Since December the
cities are not as dark at night. People can and do criticize
politicians at the tops of their lungs. Food lines are fewer.
People can start small service businesses; they can own a
little land. Everyone has a passport (although no access to
hard currency for travel). And they now can vote.
   But the uncertainty is over what those votes are worth. As
Sunday's elections approach, a lot of Romanians think not
very much.
