   Shareholders of Champion International Corp. approved a
resolution asking that one of the paper company's
anti-takeover measures be put to a shareholder vote,
according to the resolution's sponsor.
   Some analysts and Champion shareholders interpreted the
52% vote as a slap at Champion Chairman Andrew Sigler, an
outspoken opponent of corporate raiders and hostile
takeovers, because Champion's performance has lagged behind
that of other paper concerns.

   The vote is also the latest example of growing activism by
giant institutional investors in the governance of companies
in which they own stock. "We believe this is the beginning of
a shareholder revolt to bring out value in this company,"
said Neil Weisman, president of Chilmark Capital Corp., which
owns more than one million Champion shares.
   The nonbinding resolution was sponsored by Wisconsin State
Investment Board, which owns 1.2 million Champion shares. It
asked that the Stamford, Conn., company put its poison pill,
which makes a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive, to a
shareholder vote. The measure was opposed by management.
   Champion executives couldn't be reached for comment on the
results of the vote because the company's phones were out of
order due to phone-company trouble. The vote tally was
disclosed by the Wisconsin state fund, which has $23 billion
in assets.
   Some Wall Street investors found it ironic that Mr.
Sigler, who headed a task force reviewing takeover-related
issues for the Business Roundtable, a corporate lobbying
group, should come under attack from shareholders on a
takeover-related issue.
   Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at First Manhattan Corp., said
the vote "was in effect against management, and was symbolic
of shareholders' interest in being heard more." She estimates
the company's assets are worth $70 a share.
   Mark Rogers, a paper industry analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said that Champion's average annual return
on equity for the past five years has been just under 11%
compared with nearly 15% for the paper industry as a whole.
   One reason Champion has underperformed, Mr. Rogers said,
is "too much capital spending." He said Mr. Sigler "is
perceived to be less sensitive to shareholders' interests
than others in the industry." He said that may have
influenced yesterday's vote.
   Champion stock rose by 75 cents a share to $30.125
yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on volume of 483,600 shares. As of March 29, Champion had
93.1 million shares outstanding.
   While traders said the vote didn't immediately change
Champion's prospects of being taken over in a hostile bid,
they said it did highlight shareholder dissatisfaction with
management that could make the company vulnerable to a proxy
challenge.
   Champion rescued St. Regis Corp. from the clutches of
corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith in 1984. But until
Georgia-Pacific Corp. made a bid for Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp. last fall, a U.S. paper company had never made a
hostile bid for another. Shortly after that bid, Champion
sold an 8% block of stock to investor Warren Buffett in what
was seen as another anti-takeover defense.
