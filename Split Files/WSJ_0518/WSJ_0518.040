   MILAN -- Italian chemical joint venture Enimont S.p.A.
disclosed plans for a large-scale offer for an unidentified
company as it registered a 12% drop for 1989 net income.
Enimont originally had estimated an earnings increase of at
least 18%.
   Managing Director Sergio Cragnotti, at a news conference
following a seven-hour board meeting here, gave no hints as
to the target of the offer. However, he said it would be
announced Monday and that the planned acquisition would be
financed through a $1 billion issue of bonds with warrants.

   The acquisition move comes as Enimont remains enmeshed in
a bitter dispute for control between its two core
shareholders, the private-sector group Montedison S.p.A. and
state energy group Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. Enimont's
business also has been hit by a downturn in the chemical
industry.
   Enimont posted total consolidated net of 740 billion lire
($612 million) for last year, its first year of operation.
Net excluding minority interests was 716 billion lire. Sales,
which rose 4.7%, were 15.35 trillion lire.
   This compared with a pro forma total net for 1988 of 844
billion lire and 817 billion lire for net excluding minority
interests; 1988 pro forma sales were 14.66 trillion lire.
These figures relate to the activities in 1988 of companies
allocated to Enimont by the two founding shareholders at the
start of 1989.
   "The results are a bit worse than expected," Paolo-Filippo
Lardera, Italian analyst at London broker UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, commented. However, he noted that analysts' forecasts
had been revised downward recently following the company's
own more pessimistic statements.
   Last September Enimont executives were predicting a profit
for the year in excess of one trillion lire. This has since
been criticized by analysts as too optimistic.
   Mr. Cragnotti said the sharpness of the downturn in the
chemical sector had surprised the company. "It wasn't a
gradual decline . . . I think we did a good job. I don't
think the market can complain," he said.
   What has been concerning international investors is the
dispute between ENI and Montedison both over who should
control the company and what its long-term strategy should
be. The dispute has severely disrupted day-to-day management.
   Montedison and ENI each hold 40% of Enimont shares, with
the remaining 20% publicly traded. However, many of the
publicly traded shares have been bought by allies of
Montedison President Raul Gardini; they have used their votes
to secure a 7-to-5 majority for him on the Enimont board.
   The move was achieved by adding two new seats to the
original evenly balanced 10-member board and has been
contested by ENI, so far unsuccesfully, both at shareholder
meetings and in court.
