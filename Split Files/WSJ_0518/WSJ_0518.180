   STUTTGART, West Germany -- Like the high-powered cars his
company sells, Arno Bohn is under pressure to perform.
   As newly appointed chief executive officer of Porsche AG,
Mr. Bohn slips into the driver's seat at a time when the West
German auto maker is staging an impressive comeback. After a
slump three years ago that wiped out a third of revenue
almost overnight, the company painstakingly has cut costs and
rebuilt profit.

   But Mr. Bohn's task -- to solidify these gains and carry
the company into the 1990s -- remains daunting.
   Porsche, which prides itself on the hand-tooled quality of
its sports cars, faces an onslaught of lower-priced
competitors, particularly the Japanese. At the same time, the
auto industry is caught in a wave of global mergers and
linkups, and some experts wonder whether an exclusive auto
maker such as Porsche can survive as an independent.
   Mr. Bohn believes it can. Indeed, he sees the company's
small size as a major asset.
   "Small is not only beautiful, it also means flexibility,"
says the 42-year-old former deputy chairman of Nixdorf
Computer AG. Because of its size, he says, Porsche can react
faster to customer preferences and stay one step ahead of the
competition.
   As for rumors that Porsche could get gobbled up by a mass
producer, he says simply: "It's not always the big fat ones
that eat the smaller ones. Sometimes the faster ones have the
advantage."
   Maybe so, but the company still is haunted by memories of
how quickly a good business can go bad for a small player --
and Mr. Bohn's challenge is to make sure it doesn't happen
again.
   In the mid-1980s, under the high-profile leadership of
Peter Schutz, Porsche was cranking out record numbers of cars
and profit was soaring. The company also had become hooked on
the U.S. market, where sales of lower-priced, four-cylinder
models blossomed. It was a pleasing picture for Ferry
Porsche, the 80-year-old son of the company's founder and
company patriarch, who together with his family and the Piech
family control most of Porsche's shares.
   But then the bubble burst. In 1987, battered by the stock
market collapse and the tumbling dollar, sales plummeted. Mr.
Schutz quickly was succeeded by Heinz Branitzki, a
no-nonsense finance man who set out to steer the company away
from disaster.
   Mr. Branitzki slashed production of the cheaper cars,
instituted a brutal cost-reduction program, and relaunched
the company's most-popular 911 model. "Branitzki shifted
production back toward the area where the company was
strongest to begin with -- the top-of-the-line luxury sports
car -- but he didn't cut research and development," says
Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London. "That policy is really coming home now."
   And so Mr. Bohn, who succeeded Mr. Branitzki in March, is
taking the wheel at a time when Porsche appears firmly back
in the fast lane. Pretax profit for the first half ended Jan.
31 surged to 75 million Deutsche marks ($46 million) from
DM38 million ($23 million) a year earlier, while net profit
for fiscal 1989 was 54.2 million marks, about twice what it
was the year before.
   Still, the affable West German says he has no intention of
riding on the success of his predecessor.
   Mr. Bohn plans to accelerate the pace of technological
innovation at Porsche, particularly the introduction of
environmental and computer technology. He also is keeping a
close eye on the company's Japanese competitors, who he
openly acknowledges, unlike many West German auto makers, are
a long-term threat. "They're not competitors of today,
really," he says. "But I'm talking about the competition in
three to five years' time."
   Mr. Bohn also is determined to continue the restructuring
of global sales that began under Mr. Branitzki. When the
company hit its rough patch in the mid-1980s, the U.S. market
accounted for 61% of global sales -- a figure analysts say
made Porsche overly dependent on a single foreign market.
   Today, Porsche still gets 72% of its revenue from foreign
markets, but only 28% of that is in the U.S. Japan, which
accounts for 10% of global sales, is Porsche's fastest
growing and most profitable market, and Mr. Bohn is eager to
expand distribution networks there.
   "Our problem isn't how we can sell cars," says Mr. Bohn,
"our problem is meeting the demand." Indeed, the company has
virtually no inventory of unsold cars, and in Europe, the
waiting time for some models can stretch up to a year.
   With this in mind, Mr. Bohn insists the company's
structure is well-suited to the fast-changing global auto
industry. "Everyone can mass-produce cars," he says. But in
the future, he contends, car companies will move toward
producing smaller numbers of specialized models.
   Porsche is also much less dependent than many other
European or U.S. auto makers on producing its own parts,
relying instead on an integrated system of suppliers. "In
manufacturing, we have a concept which looks pretty
Japanese," says Mr. Bohn. The average Japanese car company
provides only 18% of production content to a new car, relying
on suppliers for the rest. At Porsche, this figure is about
24%, while at Daimler-Benz AG it's 38%.
   Despite these strengths, Mr. Bohn admits he can't afford
to make mistakes. The Porsche mystique is built as much on
classic consistency as it is on horsepower. The basic design
for the Porsche 911, for instance, hasn't changed since its
introduction in 1963. "Big innovations could kill the
company," he says.
