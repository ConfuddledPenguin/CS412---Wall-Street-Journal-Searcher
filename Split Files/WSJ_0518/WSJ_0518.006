   NEW YORK -- International business leaders expect sales
and profits to rise this quarter, reversing a recent trend of
pessimism, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s latest
survey of 10,000 executives from 12 countries.
   The prospects were felt to be bleakest in Brazil,
Australia and England; while optimism ran highest in Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany.
