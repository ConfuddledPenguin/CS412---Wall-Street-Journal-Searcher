   Henkel KGaA, reporting a 10% rise in four-month sales and
even higher earnings growth, said sales and profit will also
rise for all of 1990.
   The West German chemicals company, whose 1989 net jumped
15% to 404 million marks ($246 million) from 352 million
marks, didn't give any more details on results of the first
four months. "All in all, the new year started positively for
Henkel," Chairman Helmut Sihler said at a news conference in
Duesseldorf.
