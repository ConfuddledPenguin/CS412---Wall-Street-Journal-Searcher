   NEW YORK -- On a recent Sunday evening, listeners of radio
station WXRK-FM here heard an unreleased song by Ned Sublette
and the Persuasions, "Ever-Widening Circle of Remorse."
   Vin Scelsa, the disk jockey on duty, liked it so much he
immediately played it again. And again. During the record's
third go-around, Mr. Scelsa talked over the song and
interrupted it to comment on various lyrics that caught his
interest.

   Clearly, this isn't cookie-cutter radio.
   Mr. Scelsa is an oddity in an era when most radio is
dominated by carefully researched, risk-averse formats that
live by computer-generated playlists. He is a throwback to
the free-form radio of the late 1960s, when progressive rock
first hit the airwaves and disk jockeys enjoyed wide freedom
to play whatever they wanted.
   But Mr. Scelsa may also be the forerunner of a new wave of
disk jockeys who are being put on the air for their musical
knowledge: Free-form programming, which had dwindled to as
few as five stations around the country in the mid-1980s,
appears to be making a modest comeback.
   To be sure, most free-form stations give disk jockeys less
freedom these days than they did in the '60s, when listeners
may have been assaulted by a half-hour of sitar music or
18-minute album cuts with seven-minute guitar solos. But the
number of stations whose playlists go beyond the staples of
album-oriented rock, such as Led Zeppelin and the Who, has
jumped nearly eightfold in the past several years to 39, says
Robert Unmacht, president and managing editor of M Street
Journal, a Washington-based weekly publication that
chronicles format changes.
   Free-form radio is re-emerging because it serves as a way
for stations to carve distinct identities in a cluttered
market. KDHT-FM in Denver adopted a progressive format in
June to stand out from the roughly 40 other radio stations in
its metropolitan area. WTKX-AM in Pensacola, Fla., went
free-form in December because it "distinguishes {us} from the
rest of the pack," says Matt Shane, program director.
   Radio programmers say the format may draw baby boomers,
whom advertisers covet, because many grew up listening to it
in its heyday. Free-form could also lure college students
because free-form dominates college radio stations.
   The movement to free-form programming, though incremental,
is happening not only on the FM band, with its high-quality
stereo sound, but also on AM, which rock music had all but
abandoned. AM now serves mainly as home to specialty talk
formats, such as call-in, news, religion and sports shows.
But some AM stations, such as Pensacola's WKTX, have begun
experimenting. Howard Seaton, operations manager of WTKX,
says, "We're offering this community something that hasn't
been tried in about 15 years -- radio that hasn't come from a
computer."
   WTKX disk jockeys are given "some degree of freedom," says
Mr. Shane, the program director. The eclectic playlist, which
he calls "DJ heaven," includes the folk music of Suzanne
Vega, the British disco of Depeche Mode and the mournful
country pop of the Cowboy Junkies.
   But stations boasting non-format formats have some
restrictions. "We give the DJs guidelines," says Ira Gordon,
program director at Denver's KDHT-FM. They can't repeat
records that are currently popular for 12 hours, and some
older records have an eight-day rest before they can be
played again. But, Mr. Gordon adds, the DJs "have a lot more
freedom than most."
   FM progressive radio began in the mid-1960s when the
Federal Communications Commission ruled that companies that
owned AM-FM combination stations had to program them
separately. Because FM wasn't a moneymaker, many stations
became a laboratory for new, progressive rock music, the
antithesis of Top 40.
   DJs who started progressive radio 20 years ago and now
find themselves strangled by playlists say FM's financial
success is bittersweet. "Hey, man, radio has become nothing
but a bank with speakers attached to it," says Carl Widing,
program director and 14-year veteran of free-form station
KINK in Portland, Ore. "These days, it's harder to take risks
with the music."
   So, radio stations have become homogenized, with the same
slogans read from index cards in different cities. Doug
Clifton, a DJ for eight years with longtime progressive-rock
station KBCO-FM in Boulder, Colo., adds, "It's much harder to
start a station like this now. A station now looks to be an
instant hit in the ratings, and for that, you need to play
familiar songs. We require word of mouth."
   Some radio veterans blame the decline of free-form
programming on the DJs themselves. "What killed it was, a lot
of stations were manned by air personalities who were
self-indulgent," says Norm Winer, program director at
free-form WXRT-FM in Chicago, which ranks second in the
ratings of the city's four rock stations. "They didn't take
into account the public's musical taste," says Mr. Winer, who
was known on the air as Saxophone Joe.
   "DJs like Vin Scelsa are extinct because radio has become
so research-oriented," says Lee Abrams, a prominent radio
consultant and the managing director of Satellite Music
Network, which programs 1,000 stations nationwide. Station
managers "have little faith in disk jockeys' input and more
faith in computer printouts."
   Mr. Scelsa, a short, balding and bespectacled 42-year-old,
proudly eschews computer-selected album selections from such
rock artists as Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones. On Mr.
Scelsa's show, listeners may hear country-music legend Hank
Williams Jr. and raunchy rocker Prince back-to-back. Then
Clark Gable singing "Putting on the Ritz," followed by They
Might Be Giants, an avant-garde rock group.
   Nor does Mr. Scelsa confine himself to rock. Two weeks
ago, he hosted Michael Smith, the composer from the Broadway
play based on "The Grapes of Wrath," accompanied by actor Ron
Crawford and musician L.J. Slavin. They performed a one-hour
original piece combining what Mr. Smith calls "eclectic,
free-form" music with the text of the John Steinbeck novel.
   His weekly four-hour show, "Idiot's Delight," is named for
a Robert Sherwood play and a card game. "Idiot's delight is a
form of solitaire," he says, "and I'm playing this game alone
on the radio."
   WXRK, owned by Infinity Broadcasting Corp. and a formatted
station during most of the week, limits him to Sundays at 8
p.m., "when I can do little damage," he says. "It's doubtful
whether they would ever put me on full time." Mr. Scelsa has
trouble holding to a schedule anyway. Most Sundays, he
blithely runs well past his scheduled midnight sign-off,
playing on as much as an hour longer, "until {the show}
reaches a logical conclusion."
   Mr. Scelsa concedes that radio consultants and their
careful research will continue to set the agenda for most FM
rock stations. But "the consultants can only control that
which is easy to put into a computer," says Mr. Scelsa. "I
can't be controlled."
