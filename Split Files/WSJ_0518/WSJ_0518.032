   Aided by the troubles of bigger retailers, Merry-Go-Round
Enterprises Inc. expects to report first-quarter earnings of
$5.8 million to $6.2 million, or 26 cents to 28 cents a
share, substantially exceeding analysts' estimates, said
Michael D. Sullivan, president and chief executive officer.
   Analysts' estimates for fiscal first-quarter earnings
ranged from 10 cents a share to 17 cents a share.

   Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1991, which ended
May 5, were about $120.5 million. In the year-ago quarter,
the Joppa, Md., retailing chain posted earnings of $1.7
million, or eight cents a share, on sales of $73.9 million,
after restating for three stock dividends. In the current
year, Merry-Go-Round has about 6% more post-split shares
outstanding.
   A key factor in Merry-Go-Round's present financial
performance, Mr. Sullivan said, is the boom environment for
mall-based specialty apparel stores -- a consequence of the
financial difficulties of large retailers like Campeau Corp.
and Ames Department Stores Inc.
   With tightened credit from vendors, the large chains can't
stock new merchandise, Mr. Sullivan said. "If you can't get
fresh goods, you're like a person in quicksand. You're going
to go down. It's just a matter of when."
   Merry-Go-Round, on the other hand, has been turning
inventory at a rapid rate, about six times a year. "You have
to turn the goods to be in the fashion business," Mr.
Sullivan said. "You can't sit on dead stock," particularly
with the 15-to-25-year-olds who are the company's target
customers.
   To help avoid missing changes in consumer tastes,
merchandise staffers sit down every Monday morning and
examine what sold -- and what didn't -- in the previous week.
"It's not totally risk-free, but it's also not the total
crapshoot everyone thinks it is."
   Mr. Sullivan attributed some of Merry-Go-Round's
first-quarter earnings gain to a weak year-ago quarter, when
the company was saddled with start-up costs for a new
360,000-square-foot distribution center. In addition, the
company's April 1989 acquisition of 120 Silverman's stores
from Retail Ventures Inc. and Natco Industries Inc. increased
costs and diverted inventory from other stores.
   Although the remaining quarters won't show such a dramatic
improvement, Mr. Sullivan said he also sees strong earnings
growth for the rest of the year. He called analysts' 1991
earnings estimates of $1.35 to $1.40 a share "very attainable
and probably on the conservative side." Indeed, Mr. Sullivan
said he expects earnings for the fiscal year to be more like
$1.50 a share, or about $33.5 million, on sales of $600
million. In fiscal 1990, Merry-Go-Round earned a restated
$22.2 million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of $478.9 million.
   Merry-Go-Round's growth has left the company with $40
million in cash and a desire to expand further. This fiscal
year, the company plans to open 50 to 55 new stores and
expand others.
   And with the Silverman's acquisition well digested --
April same-store sales more than doubled at the chain -- Mr.
Sullivan is fishing for even more real estate. "It puts us in
an excellent position to look for opportunities," he said.
