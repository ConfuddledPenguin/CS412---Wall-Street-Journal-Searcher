   WASHINGTON -- A Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry
into Baxter International Inc.'s Mideast activities is
focusing on possible violations of federal anti-bribery laws.
   Investigators are seeking to determine whether the
Deerfield, Ill., hospital supplier violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act in its efforts to win access to Saudi
Arabia and other Arab markets, say individuals familiar with
the staff inquiry. The law prohibits payments to foreign
officials by U.S. firms eager to gain business overseas.

   G. Marshall Abbey, Baxter's senior vice president and
general counsel, said, "We have and still do emphatically
deny that there was any improper payment made" by Baxter
officials in the Middle East.
   Both the SEC and the Commerce Department are looking into
events surrounding Baxter's 1989 removal from the Arab
League's blacklist of corporations that do business with
Israel. The SEC inquiry also involves Baxter's Middle Eastern
activities during the mid-1980s, when the blacklisting
frustrated the company's efforts to enter the Mideast market.
Baxter's activities in the Middle East and the government's
inquiry were the subject of a May 1 article in The Wall
Street Journal.
   Specific matters under SEC scrutiny include allegations
raised in 1985 civil litigation in federal court in New York.
In that case, a former Baxter executive charged company
officials with making improper payments to Saudi officials
and businessmen by cutting prices on products sold to a Saudi
government contractor. Baxter denied the charges by the
executive and made counter-allegations against him. He also
denied the charges. The case was settled and sealed with
neither side admitting guilt.
   The SEC inquiry hasn't been expanded into a formal
investigation.
