   ST. LOUIS -- Inside its massive palace of research here,
Monsanto Co. is placing a billion-dollar bet on
biotechnology. From these laboratories eventually may come
such breakthrough products as tomato plants that engender
their own insecticides, potato plants "vaccinated" against
viruses and a hormone that makes pigs yield leaner pork.
   But Monsanto is getting a rocky reception for the first
product to come out of these labs. Last month, Wisconsin's
Gov. Tommy Thompson signed into law a one-year ban on
commercial use of BGH, a bovine growth hormone that boosts
cows' milk production, after an outcry from the very market
the company had hoped to tap -- dairy farmers. Some small
farmers feared the hormone would cause an oversupply of milk,
forcing prices down.

   As the brouhaha indicates, product introduction can be as
tortuous and time-consuming as product research -- a fact of
special note at Monsanto. The diversified chemicals company
spent most of the last decade stuffing its new-product
pipeline. "There has never been a time since I've been with
the company, when we've had this array of things coming,"
says Richard Mahoney, a 27-year Monsanto veteran and its
chief executive.
   The reckoning will come in the 1990s. Largely a
petrochemicals concern until a decade ago, the company is
increasingly vying in the drug and food markets, in which a
product can be destroyed by a promotional misstep or by
political or regulatory difficulties. Genetic engineering
ventures, in particular, typically spark passionate debates.
   Many believe Monsanto will manage to pull it off. Wall
Street analysts believe some of its new products could be
blockbusters. They forecast annual sales of $100 million to
$200 million for BGH, $300 million to $500 million for a new
fat substitute to be sold by Monsanto's NutraSweet Co., and
$500 million for an ulcer drug marketed by the G.D. Searle &amp;
Co. unit. Monsanto won't comment on the projections.
   But there have been some setbacks. Monsanto had expected
to be selling BGH in the U.S. by now, but sales so far are
limited to Czechoslovakia. NutraSweet is scrambling to get a
jump on some giant competitors that are about to follow it
into fake fats. And Searle, once praised by the Food and Drug
Administration for developing a life-saving ulcer drug,
recently had a spat with the agency over its advertising of
that drug, Cytotec.
   A sense of urgency pervades the company, whose mainstay
products face growing competition. Patents are running out on
its glyphosate herbicide, known as Roundup; on its aspartame
low-calorie sweetener, NutraSweet; and on an
anti-hypertension drug, Calan SR. Together, these compounds
account for about 20% of sales and about 40% of profit.
   Last year, Monsanto's profit rose 15% to $679 million.
Sales increased 4.7% to $8.68 billion. But first-quarter
profit was down 13%, a dip Monsanto attributed to a weaker
market for its plastics and to farmers' delayed purchases of
herbicides. The stock has been volatile in recent weeks. In
Big Board trading, it closed yesterday at $102.50, up $1.25.
   A closer look at three of Monsanto's most important new
products -- BGH, Simplesse fat substitute and Cytotec --
provides some insights about the often rough road to market.
                                                                                                       

   Bovine Growth Hormone
                                                                                                       

   Monsanto is counting on BGH to be the first to generate
some return on the more than $1 billion it has invested in
biotechnology. A protein like one cows produce naturally, BGH
is made by genetically engineered bacteria and then injected
twice a month. In farm trials, milk yields have shot up by
10% to 25%.
   But Wisconsin's move to ban BGH temporarily may embolden
farmers in other states who also fear a milk glut.
Wisconsin's suspension, in effect until June 1, 1991, has
triggered a one-year ban in Minnesota. Anti-BGH groups are
vowing to step up campaigns elsewhere. But a proposed ban
failed this week to get through the Vermont Legislature.
   How long the moves might delay sale of the hormone remains
unclear, since FDA marketing approval isn't expected until
next year anyway. FDA officials say milk from BGH-treated
cows is safe. But the bans could lead to other problems for
Monsanto.
   James Tobin, a BGH marketing manager for Monsanto,
acknowledges that opponents may press for other measures,
such as laws that would require milk from treated cows to be
labeled. That, Monsanto fears, could alarm consumers, who are
increasingly concerned about food safety.
   Mr. Tobin asserts that the bans could lead other farmers
eager to boost milk production to demand BGH. Clearly, there
are dairy farmers looking to use the hormone, although
surveys by the company and BGH opponents vary sharply.
Monsanto maintains that BGH won't bring about a sudden milk
glut, because it will gain use gradually. Because BGH offers
a quick return on investment, the company says, it won't
favor big farmers over small.
   But many small farmers, having endured wrenching changes
in the farm economy, remain leery. "This will devastate rural
communities and small farmers," asserts John Kinsman, a
farmer who has helped to spark the protest in Wisconsin.
   John Musick, who directs an anti-BGH group in Minnesota,
says he is hopeful opponents of the hormone will succeed --
if not in keeping it off the market, then in turning
consumers against it. A BGH scare "could be just like the
Alar situation," he says, referring to the scare last year
over a chemical used on apples. "Suddenly organically grown
apples were in demand."
   The FDA has approved the sale of milk from BGH trials.
However, some big grocery-store chains, including Kroger Co.,
have refused to sell the milk. The chains say they are trying
to size up consumer attitudes on the matter.
   Another genetically engineered new product is also
generating some controversy. Monsanto is conducting field
trials of cotton and soybean plants designed to resist its
Roundup herbicide, which generated sales of about $1 billion
last year. Such plants might greatly expand the market for
the herbicide; it now kills crops and weeds alike, so farmers
have to use it before crops break through the soil.
   But some environmental groups say herbicide-resistant
plants would keep farmers heavily dependent on chemicals.
They are seeking to have tax credits for this type of
research eliminated. Monsanto contends the continued use of
Roundup -- generally acknowledged to be one of the safer
herbicides -- and the introduction of Roundup-resistant crops
would mean less use of more-harmful herbicides.
   Selling Roundup-resistant crops would assure Monsanto of a
strong market for the herbicide, which has lost patent
protection in a few countries so far. It will lose such
protection in many many more starting in 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Simplesse
                                                                                                       

   Monsanto's NutraSweet Co. scored a coup in marketing its
aspartame sweetener. Among other things, it sold it to food
producers with the proviso that the ingredient's logo appear
on the final product, thus winning consumer loyalty for a
mere ingredient. The question now is whether the company can
pull off the same trick with its fat substitute, Simplesse.
   Monsanto's strategy: Introduce Simplesse, a blend of milk
and egg-white protein, in a food item that millions crave,
albeit guiltily because it is fattening: ice cream. Hence the
fat-free Simple Pleasures. In February, the FDA gave
NutraSweet approval to sell the frozen dessert, which the
company expects to get into grocers' freezers by summer.
   In the case of Simplesse, however, NutraSweet is taking
the unusual tactic of manufacturing the dessert itself,
rather than selling the fat substitute to food concerns.
NutraSweet's reasoning is that it wants to maintain control
over crucial decisions, such as flavors. Simple Pleasures
will come in six, including chocolate and rum raisin.
   Simplesse will face tough competition in the dairy case.
Even Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., a main distributor of
Simple Pleasures, has recently brought out a fat-free
dessert; Dreyer's ice cream is aimed at a lower-priced
market, however.
   Some marketing titans may soon be weighing into this food
fight with their own new products. Kraft General Foods Inc.,
a division of Philip Morris Cos., is seeking FDA approval for
a fake fat similar to Simplesse. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. wants
approval of one that is more versatile; its fake fat can be
used in hot and cold foods.
   An already heated contest for shelf space is likely to
sharpen. The ice cream buyer for Jewel Food Stores, a
Chicago-area chain, says of Simple Pleasures, "We're kind of
dragging our feet on it, because shelf space is so tight."
   NutraSweet is seeking FDA approvals to use Simplesse in
other foods, including mayonnaise, salad dressings, sour
cream, dips, margarine, butter, cheese. The company hasn't
ruled out making some of these foods itself.
   NutraSweet has had extraordinary success with aspartame,
now used in some 3,000 food and beverage items. Last year,
including the tabletop sweetener Equal, sales reached $869
million.
   Robert Shapiro, the company's chief executive, insists the
sweetener still has a bright future. Yet in countries where
aspartame has lost patent protection, the company has
preserved market share only through drastic price reductions.
In December 1991, patent protection ends in the the biggest
market, the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Cytotec
                                                                                                       

   Searle won high praise in regulatory circles last year
when it introduced its ulcer drug, Cytotec, in the U.S.
Recently, though, Searle ran afoul of the FDA -- over its
advertising.
   The FDA recently forced the drug maker to take out an
embarrassing ad in medical journals. It read, in part,
"Published To Correct a Previous Advertisement Which The Food
And Drug Administration Considered Misleading."
   The FDA said a previous Cytotec ad falsely suggested that
the drug could be used to treat a broader, typically younger,
group of patients than the agency had recommended. One of the
FDA's concerns: The earlier ad featured a photo of a woman
Searle said was 62. But the FDA thought the model looked too
youthful. Searle said it didn't intend to mislead.
   The flap suggests the difficulties of aggressively
marketing the drug. Purchased by Monsanto in 1985 for $2.75
billion, Searle has revived its research and development,
which had withered. The company intends to introduce over the
next decade a steady stream of new drugs, of which Cytotec is
the first. U.S. sales started strong, then hit a plateau. In
recent weeks, Searle says, sales have begun to climb again.
   Searle is seeking to carve out a unique role for Cytotec
amid such big-selling ulcer drugs as Glaxo Holdings PLC's
Zantac and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Tagamet. Cytotec is aimed
especially at arthritis patients who are on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. Such patients often develop stomach
ulcers. Cytotec, a synthetic prostaglandin, is believed to
help protect the stomach lining.
   Cytotec sometimes has side effects, like abdominal cramps
and diarrhea, so doctors tend to be cautious in prescribing
it. Doctors sometimes advise patients to take only half a
tablet.
   Searle is trying to fine-tune Cytotec. It is seeking to
develop a sustained-release formulation that lessens side
effects. The company is performing other studies to determine
whether the drug could be used to treat other conditions.
Searle forecasts world-wide Cytotec sales this year between
$80 million and $90 million, up from $60 million last year.
   Meanwhile, the makers of Zantac and Tagamet are eyeing the
Cytotec market. Both are undertaking studies in an effort to
win regulatory approval for use in treating the same
condition.
