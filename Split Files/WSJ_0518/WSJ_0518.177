   Ashland Oil Inc. said its exploration unit agreed to buy
natural gas properties from an Occidental Petroleum Corp.
unit for $107 million.
   The Ashland, Ky., company said it will acquire about
550,000 acres of producing and undeveloped properties in West
Virginia and Kentucky from Los Angeles-based Occidental's OXY
USA Inc. subsidiary. Production averages about 16 million
cubic feet a day.

   Ashland said the acquisition, which is subject to certain
government approvals, will double its acreage of gas
properties. The company already produces 39 million cubic
feet a day from about 500,000 acres in Appalachia. Many of
the new sites are contiguous to Ashland's properties.
   Analysts said the Appalachian properties are valuable
because of their proximity to Eastern U.S. markets, among
other things. "Producers in the region will be in a good
position" as reserves in other areas are depleted, said
Bernard Picchi, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New
York.
