   WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders and administration
officials met for two hours but were unable to decide quickly
on either a projection of the fiscal 1991 deficit or how to
account for the soaring cost of the savings and loan
association cleanup.
   At the second session of the so-called budget summit,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said he will unveil new,
substantially bigger cost estimates Wednesday for the thrift
bailout. Participants said he gave them no specifics but
warned that the estimates remain volatile and uncertain.

   The administration is pressing for a quick agreement to
alter the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to exclude
thrift costs so that the summit can wrestle with other
issues. Democrats aren't ready to go along yet because of
objections from some of their rank and file, but they concede
there is no alternative.
   Despite all the statements about the urgency of the
deficit problem, the budget summit is off to a slow start,
with negotiators distracted by technical issues rather than
the search for a compromise on spending cuts and tax
increases. Some congressional staffers fear that if the pace
doesn't pick up after Congress returns from the Memorial Day
recess, the talks could bog down.
   At one point, according to one participant, White House
Budget Director Richard Darman displayed his impatience,
saying, "I'd like to get this thing moving."
   "We're still trying to find the facts," House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) told reporters after the
meeting ended. And Senate Budget Chairman James Sasser (D.,
Tenn.) said the talks are proceeding at the pace he expected.
"A number of members aren't as up to speed as those of us who
deal with this on a daily basis," he said.
   After some haggling at the meeting, Mr. Darman agreed to
allow public distribution of new administration deficit
estimates, which had already been leaked. As previously
reported, the White House budget office now projects a
deficit for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 of between $123
billion and $138 billion, up from a January estimate of $101
billion. The figures exclude thrift bailout costs.
   The office said the projection swelled as much as $22
billion because of higher-than-projected interest rates and
inflation and lower-than-projected tax receipts. The figure
was boosted $14 billion more by higher spending forecasts,
including a $5 billion increase in projected spending on
commercial bank failures.
   Based on Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. estimates, the
administration in January assumed that bank insurance
premiums would exceed the cost of bank failures by $2.8
billion in 1991. Although the FDIC says it hasn't made any
recent updates, the budget office now assumes costs of bank
failures will exceed premiums by about $2.2 billion.
   Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, told negotiators that the changing economy and
unanticipated shortfall in tax receipts have lifted his
agency's deficit forecast between $15 billion and $25
billion. Excluding thrift costs, the budget office now
foresees a 1991 deficit of between $149 billion and $159
billion.
   To avoid triggering across-the-board spending cuts this
fall, Congress and the White House need to agree on a package
of spending cuts and tax increases that reduce the deficit to
within $10 billion of the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman target.
   Messrs. Darman and Reischauer and Michael Boskin, chairman
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, all agreed
that cutting the deficit more than 1% of the gross national
product, or about $55 billion, could hurt the economy. A
gimmick-free, deficit-reduction package of that size would be
more than twice what any negotiators have achieved in past
years.
   Earlier yesterday, William Diefenderfer, deputy director
of the White House budget office, said at a U.S. Chamber of
Commerce breakfast that he anticipates the summit eventually
will produce a deficit-reduction package of between $40
billion and $50 billion.
   But he doesn't anticipate a speedy resolution. "It's going
to take three or four months to do this thing if we're going
to do it right," he said. "Congress tends to have two things
that make it move: crisis and Christmas," the former Senate
staff member added. "Christmas is too far off and crisis is
not the atmosphere we would want to deal with this."
   Democrats, meanwhile, continued a steady drumbeat of
criticism of President Bush for refusing to detail publicly
the scope of the deficit problem or to offer a solution. "The
president is enormously popular," said Sen. Alan Dixon (D.,
Ill.). "I can't think of anything more worth spending some of
that political capital on than a real substantive plan to
reduce deficits."
   And Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.) charged, "He's reluctant
to use the power of the presidency to do more than go into
the Rose Garden and give athletes or actresses a moment in
the sun."
   Administration officials argue that the solution doesn't
lie in public posturing, but in good-faith negotiations. And
even some top Democrats say privately that the persistent
partisan rhetoric is creating an atmosphere in which it is
difficult to bargain over a compromise package of spending
cuts and tax increases.
