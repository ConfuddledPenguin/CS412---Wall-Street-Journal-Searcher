   LOS ANGELES -- Columnist Art Buchwald is out to prove that
Paramount Pictures Corp.'s accounting doesn't add up.
   Preliminary audit figures on the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming
To America" were released this week by attorneys for Mr.
Buchwald and his co-plaintiff, producer Alain Bernheim, as
part their continuing legal battle against Paramount over
profits from the film. What their audit shows is a $58
million difference between their calculations of the film's
bottom line and Paramount's.

   The Buchwald team says "Coming To America" earned a "net
profit" of $39.8 million. Paramount says the film had a "net
loss" of $18 million. The issue is an important one because a
state court here ruled in January that Mr. Buchwald had
provided the story idea for the film and was therefore
entitled to be paid part of the proceeds under a contract he
had signed with Paramount.
   Though the numbers might indicate otherwise, Paramount
isn't saying "Coming To America," which took in $275 million
in revenue world-wide, didn't make money. Instead, the studio
is arguing that Mr. Buchwald knowingly signed a contract that
explicitly spelled out the formula for "net profits" under
which he would be entitled to a piece of the proceeds. That
contract defines net profit as what's left after the
deduction of certain costs, expenses, and so-called "gross"
participations for the star and director.
   Paramount says that the film had income of $125.3 million
and that after distribution fees of $42.3 million,
distribution expenses of $36.2 million, interest expenses of
$6.3 million, and production costs of $58.5 million, the net
loss was $18 million. Mr. Buchwald's attorneys say their
audit shows income from the film was actually $160.9 million;
distribution fees were $54.8 million, distribution expenses
were $43.1 million, interest was nil, and production costs
were $22.9 million, for a net profit of $39.8 million.
   Robert M. Schwartz, an attorney with the Los Angeles law
firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers, which is representing Paramount, says
Mr. Buchwald's attorneys "went off in a fantasy world and
cooked up these numbers . . . . They are completely at odds
with the contract."
   The Buchwald camp maintains that Paramount and others in
the industry inflate such expenses and costs, and the
contracts themselves virtually guarantee that writers,
directors, producers and actors who sign them won't make any
money.
