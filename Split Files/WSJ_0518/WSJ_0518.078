   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 507 money-market funds
fell $1.78 billion to $381.71 billion in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington trade association.
   Assets of 245 general-purpose funds fell $640.3 million to
$131.53 billion; assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell $1.41
billion to $158.43 billion; and assets of 160 institutional
funds rose $270.1 million to $91.75 billion.

   "Yields on money-market funds inched up, and the yield
differential favoring money-market funds over alternative
investment vehicles available to individuals widened by a
few" hundredths of a percentage point, said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist for the institute. "And
yet assets in individual accounts declined again as
individuals have drawn on their money-market-fund balances to
pay for stepped-up purchases of equities and equity-fund
shares as well as for Treasury bills and notes bought at last
week's auction."
   The latest drop was the eighth-consecutive week of decline
for money-market-fund assets. The total drop for the eight
weeks was about $10.5 billion, and "I think there are a
couple of pretty good reasons," Mr. Dreyer said. "Until
recently, you had a slight creep-up of
{certificate-of-deposit} rates, which means individuals were
shifting money," he said.
   During the eight-week period, "institutional balances
barely changed," he said. "The whole bloody thing happened in
broker-dealer and general-purpose funds," which are geared to
individuals.
   The second reason Mr. Dreyer cited was tax season, when
"people like me who owed money to the {Internal Revenue
Service} paid at the last moment." And third, "in the past
couple of weeks, we've had an excellent stock market, and
people are dabbling" in stocks and stock funds.
   Mr. Dreyer said that in the first three weeks of January,
assets rose a total $15.5 billion, "so this is not the end of
the world."
