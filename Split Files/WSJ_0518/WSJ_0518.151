   Navistar International Corp. said second-quarter earnings
fell 77% on a 10% sales decline, reflecting the continued
industrywide slump in retail-truck sales.
   The Chicago maker of trucks and diesel engines said it
earned $8 million, or one cent a share, on sales of $977
million for the fiscal-second quarter ended April 30. In the
year-earlier quarter, the company earned $35 million, or 11
cents a share, on sales of $1.09 billion.

   For the six months, Navistar had a loss of $10 million, or
10 cents a share, compared with earnings of $72 million, or
23 cents a share. Sales fell to $1.81 billion from $2.04
billion.
   Industry sales of medium and heavy trucks in North
America, according to Navistar, totaled 71,000 units in the
quarter, down 12% from last year. Navistar said it delivered
22,200 units during the quarter, down 10%.
   Navistar said it expects industry sales of heavy trucks to
fall 18% to 142,000 units, and medium trucks to fall 4% to
153,000 units, in its fiscal year ending Oct. 31.
