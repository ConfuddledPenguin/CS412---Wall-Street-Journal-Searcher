   SALT LAKE CITY -- American Stores Co. said it will sell
one of its grocery chains, settling an antitrust action
brought against it by the state of California.
   As part of the settlement, American Stores will sell 161
Alpha Beta stores in southern California. The stores, which
had sales of roughly $1.8 billion last year, were valued at
at least $400 million by analysts. The grocery company has
five years to complete the sale and doesn't have to put Alpha
Beta on the block for six months.

   A decision by the Supreme Court last month, clearing the
way for California to challenge American Stores' 1988
takeover of Lucky Stores Inc., set the stage for yesterday's
settlement.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Stores climbed $3.50 a share to $69 on news of the
settlement, as analysts observed that American Stores was
fortunate it retained its prized Lucky chain.
   "People were expecting the worst," said Robert Roth, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch Research/U.S. "Selling Alpha Beta
{rather than Lucky} is certainly the lesser of two evils."
   American Stores, initially the owner of Alpha Beta Stores
Inc., took over Lucky Stores in June 1988. But California
officials sued to block the merger of the two operations,
arguing it would cost consumers in the state $400 million a
year in higher prices. The state won a federal court order
forcing American Stores to operate the two chains
independently during the state's suit, though the company was
later allowed to integrate its Lucky and Alpha Beta
operations in northern California and Las Vegas.
   A spokesman for American Stores said that "we could not
continue to litigate" because of the effect that years more
of uncertainty would have on its operations.
   The company declined to specify any potential buyers for
Alpha Beta. Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co., said
possible suitors could include Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., a
subsidiary of Tengelmann AG of West Germany, Kroger Co. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   Besides Alpha Beta, American Stores is considering the
sale of Buttrey Food &amp; Drug, a division of one of its
subsidiaries.
   In taking over Lucky, the company's debt soared to $3.1
billion, so "management is really focusing on bringing debt
down," Mr. Ziegler said.
