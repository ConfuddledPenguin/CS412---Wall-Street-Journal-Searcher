   Southmark Corp. said in Dallas that it expects to report a
net loss of $59 million for the third quarter, ended March
31, compared with a net loss of $1.04 billion after massive
asset write-downs in the year-earlier period.
   The real estate and thrift concern, which is operating
under bankruptcy-law proceedings, said it has notified the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it will file its Form
10-Q late. The company said the competing demands of the
bankruptcy proceedings have kept it from getting its
financial report prepared on time.
