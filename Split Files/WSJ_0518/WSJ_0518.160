   Royal Dutch/Shell Group said first-quarter net income
dropped 36% to #816 million ($1.37 billion) from #1.28
billion a year earlier, within analysts' expectations on a
historic-cost basis, accounting for changes in values of
inventories.
   On a current-cost basis, valuing the company's oil
inventories at current market prices, profit fell 26% to #826
million from #1.11 billion. Operating profit edged up 2.8% to
#1.48 billion from #1.44 billion.

   Sales rose 22% to #17.5 billion from #14.3 billion a year

56% to #159 million; U.S. chemical sales fell. Coal and
