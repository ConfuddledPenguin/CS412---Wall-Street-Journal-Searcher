   In regard to your hallucinatory editorial-page article of
April 19 about Kenny Rogers's well-earned place on Rolling
Stone's "Environmental Hall of Shame" list:
   Mr. Rogers called Greenpeace USA Chairman David Chatfield
(whom your researchers might have discovered was the "guy in
San Francisco" had research been a priority for you) in
February 1989 and identified himself as an "investor" in
Summit Cement Co.'s toxic-waste-incinerator project. Mr.
Chatfield never gave the "off-the-record" approval attributed
to him, and your reporter committed journalistic malpractice
by making no effort to verify that statement (or even verify
the identity of the person who said it).

   Summit Cement, whose waste is both "toxic" and
"hazardous," chose to build a plant in the Bahamas to escape
the community opposition that has become commonplace in the
U.S. due to the poor track record of waste handlers. Summit
Cement's stated goal, according to papers filed with both the
EPA and the Bahamian government, was to import up to 88,000
tons of waste from the U.S.
   The project was not killed by "environmentalist
roadblocks," but by the Bahamian government's denial of
permission to import the waste. For his flacking for such an
ill-advised project, Kenny Rogers deserves his spot in the
Environmental Hall of Shame. Your editorial page rates an
even higher ranking.
