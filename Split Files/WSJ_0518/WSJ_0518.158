   WASHINGTON -- A House-Senate conference agreed on major
provisions of a spending bill that expedites aid to Panama
and Nicaragua and adds more than $3 billion to assorted
domestic accounts for the year ending Sept. 30.
   Negotiations continued on proposed reductions and
transfers within Pentagon accounts to accommodate the new
expenditures, but the appropriations leadership appeared
confident that a package will be enacted before the Memorial
Day recess beginning next week.

   Amendments on abortion rights and the death penalty were
stripped from the measure last night, and House Democrats
agreed to insert waivers intended to expedite the Central
American aid if lawmakers can't agree on related authorizing
legislation.
   The action represents a concession to President Bush, but
the victory carries a high price tag. The domestic portion of
the bill has grown steadily under the pressure of lawmakers,
and influential members seized the opportunity to initiate
home-state projects and allow the transfer of funds to pay
for House members' election-year mail.
   Environmentalists blunted an effort by Southern
agriculture interests to weaken federal wetlands protections.
But in a little-noticed fight over the future of the private
U.S. space industry, the conference approved language seeking
to block the participation of a United Technologies Corp.
subsidiary in an Australian launch facility.
   The Central American aid -- $420 million for Panama and
$300 million for Nicaragua -- represents the bulk of Mr.
Bush's initial request this spring. But the administration
still faces a difficult floor fight next week on the related
question of imposing conditions on U.S. military assistance
to El Salvador.
   Democrats have picked up significant support for their
demand that 50% of the assistance be withheld through fiscal
1991, and Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.,), chairman of the
Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, joined in backing an
amendment to give the civilian Cristiani government greater
control of the funds.
   Mr. Murtha's leadership is significant because of his ties
to fellow moderates and Southern conservatives, and a strong
vote would add to the pressure on the State Department to
withhold a substantial portion of any new Salvadoran military
aid in fiscal 1991. "They have to go to 50% in `91," said Mr.
Murtha. "We're funding the military, and the military has to
reform."
   The Central America debate brought two former House
speakers, James Wright and Thomas O'Neill, back into the fray
in an unusual display of letters to their former colleagues.
Mr. Wright, who resigned a year ago, has appealed to members
to first expedite passage of the aid to Nicaragua and Panama,
while Mr. O'Neill's letter directly addresses the El Salvador
question and supports the conditions on future aid.
   Apart from the Central American assistance, the bill
includes a total of $55 million distributed among accounts
for the Caribbean, Chile and Africa. An estimated $75 million
in supplemental funds are provided for U.S. refugee programs,
and in a related provision, Israel would get $400 million in
loan guarantees for housing of incoming Soviet Jews. Under
pressure from the House, fees to the U.S. for the guarantees
were increased to $2.8 million up front, but a $125,000
ceiling is set on annual fees charged to the Jerusalem
government.
   Defense negotiators last night appeared determined to
block construction of a costly Louisiana explosives plant
previously protected by the Senate, but among domestic
accounts, the pattern was one of accommodation.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd
emerged with a $185 million down payment on a new Federal
Bureau of Investigation fingerprint facility for his home
state of West Virginia, and the laundry list of smaller
additions ran from a Great Lakes research vessel to a earthen
dam in northern California.
   House lawmakers, who are spending far beyond their
appropriated allotment for mail this year, won broad
authority to transfer as much as $25 million in unobligated
funds from other accounts to meet the projected deficit.
   And while adding an estimated $177 million to firefighting
accounts in the Bureau of Land Management, the conference
also provided that $77 million be used to replenish other
Interior Department accounts that were tapped in meeting the
costs of fires last year.
   Among business interests, the bill would force the
administration to proceed with the so-called
interest-equalization program of the Export-Import Bank,
effectively providing $20 million for what would be a $200
million loan program to encourage exports.
   By contrast, the provision related to United Technologies
grows out of an effort by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman
Ernest Hollings to curb export licenses for American
technology or satellites in private efforts using Soviet or
Chinese-built launchers.
   Though allowing for a presidential waiver in cases
involving national security, the South Carolina Democrat
first attached satellite restrictions last fall to an
appropriations bill funding the Commerce Department. The
added language now is intended to apply the same restrictions
to those providing technical services, and committee staffers
said the provision was opposed by United Technologies because
of the impact on a subsidiary's application to participate in
a Cape York, Australia, space facility that might use the
cheaper Soviet or Chinese launchers.
