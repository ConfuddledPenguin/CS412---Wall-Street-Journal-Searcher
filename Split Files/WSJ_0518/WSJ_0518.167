   Bolstered by huge trading profits in 1989, Japan's giant
securities companies managed to report sharply higher
earnings for the 12 months ended last March 31 despite the
Tokyo market's steep decline this year.
   Analysts said the Big Four, Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa
Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities
Co., relied heavily on trading profits in Japanese equities
warrants in London last year. More than $70 billion in new
warrants were issued last year, nearly all of them
underwritten by Japanese securities companies. The Japanese
securities companies would simply hold onto the new warrants
until they could sell them at a big profit.

   A warrant is issued in conjunction with a bond and, like
an option, allows its holder to buy a certain amount of stock
at a set price within a set period. As share prices go higher
-- and Japanese prices soared to a record at the close of
1989 -- warrant prices zoom.
   Since the end of last year, though, the stock and warrant
markets have shriveled. The Tokyo stock market dropped nearly
a third in highly volatile trading, spurred on by the
weakening yen and higher interest rates. Turnover dried up as
investors fled the market.
   "The first quarter should have killed them, but they'd
already made their killing in warrants," a Tokyo-based
financial analyst at one U.S. securities company said.
   Nonetheless, some analysts have warned that Japan's
securities companies could be in for a rockier road this
year, even though the Nikkei average of 225 stocks has
regained about a third of its losses of the first three
months. That's largely because turnover has remained at a
paltry half-billion shares a day recently, down from twice
that level a year ago.
   Under a 1988 Japanese law, the four securities firms
changed their fiscal year from one ending Sept. 30 to one
ending March 31. Consequently, the following results for the
fiscal year that ended last March are compared with a
doubling of the results for the six-month transition fiscal
period that ended March 31, 1989.
   Nomura's pretax profit slipped 1% to 488.87 billion yen
($3.22 billion). Operating revenue fell 2% to 986.19 billion
yen. Net income totaled 218.68 billion yen, up 5%.
   Daiwa Securities became the second-largest Japanese
brokerage in terms of operating revenue, posting a 4.7% gain
to 660.14 billion yen.
   Pretax profit for Daiwa rose 0.3% to 313.15 billion yen,
while net income rose 11.4% to 146.03 billion yen.
   Third-place Nikko Securities posted a 1.6% gain in pretax
profit to 260.45 billion yen. Operating revenue rose 6.5% to
600.99 billion yen.
   Nikko's net income jumped 16% to 120.14 billion yen.
   Yamaichi's pretax profit rose 7.9% to 233.66 billion yen.
Operating revenue was also up 7.9% to 573.5 billion yen. Net
income increased 6.5% to 98.05 billion yen.
