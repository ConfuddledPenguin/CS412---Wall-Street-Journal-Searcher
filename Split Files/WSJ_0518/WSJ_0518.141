   NEW YORK -- Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
said John B. Carter, the company's 55-year-old president and
chief executive officer, is retiring, effective immediately.
   Richard H. Jenrette, Equitable's chairman and chief
investment officer, will assume Mr. Carter's duties, the
company said.

   During Mr. Carter's seven-year tenure, Equitable
aggressively sold instruments known as guaranteed investment
contracts that promised annual yields of as much as 18%. When
interest rates plunged, the company sustained severe losses
on the contracts.
   According to Mr. Jenrette, who has been chairman since
1987, Mr. Carter doesn't have any immediate plans. "I think
he's planning to take a vacation first. He'll probably do a
little bit of gardening. He loves to garden," said Mr.
Jenrette.
   Mr. Carter was said to be unavailable for comment on his
departure or his plans.
   When asked why Mr. Carter's departure seemed so abrupt,
Mr. Jenrette said it really wasn't. "He told me, when I first
came here in 1985, that he wanted to retire at 55, after he
had completed 30 years of service with the company and served
as CEO for seven years," Mr. Jenrette said. Mr. Carter joined
Equitable in 1960 after his graduation from the Harvard
Business School.
   Equitable, the nation's third-largest life insurance
company, jumped into various ventures under Mr. Carter's
leadership. A number of them, including the guaranteed-income
contracts and a foray in group health coverage, proved major
disappointments. Several rounds of intensive cost-cutting
were needed to conserve Equitable's capital.
   Institutional investors pumped billions into the
income-guarantee contracts in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
and some contracts stayed on the books for as long as 10
years. When interest rates began to decline in 1982,
Equitable turned to junk bonds, but even their yields weren't
high enough to match the contract obligations.
   In an interview last year, Mr. Carter estimated that,
since 1982, Equitable had gone "in the hole" each year for
$200 million to $250 million because of these
guaranteed-income contracts.
   But the contracts weren't the only source of trouble for
Mr. Carter. Equitable's total premiums, considerations and
purchase payments have been declining steadily for the past
several years, from $7.77 billion in 1986 to $6.36 billion in
1989. Company insiders said morale soured again last year as
Equitable began another round of cost-cutting. Mr. Jenrette
said yesterday that Equitable had cut expenses by about $50
million some two years ago and plans to reduce costs by an
equal amount this year.
   Even so, the austerity measures haven't been companywide.
Last month, for example, top executives and the company's 100
agency managers were flown to Monaco for meetings.
   In a letter to Equitable's agents, Mr. Jenrette, who is 61
years old, said Mr. Carter's retirement puts "both an
enormous burden and an exciting challenge on my shoulders."
He indicated that Mr. Carter would cooperate to make the
shift of responsibilities orderly, but it wasn't immediately
clear whether the company would eventually search for a new
president.
