   TOKYO -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Finance Ministry
said they are investigating share trading in Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. ahead of a stock-split announcement.
   Officials at the exchange and the ministry, which share
responsibility for conducting inquiries under the country's
year-old insider-trading law, described their investigations
as routine. A stock-exchange official said he doesn't believe
the investigation would produce evidence of insider trading,
but an official at the ministry noted that the government
doesn't normally pursue stock-market investigations unless
they see unusual dealings.

   The bank's share price began to climb sharply Tuesday on
heavy volume. Trading in the stock was suspended by the
exchange Wednesday morning, just before the bank announced a
1-for-10 share split. The stock split is effective Aug. 11.
   Before they were suspended, Long-Term Credit Bank's share
price had jumped to 21,500 yen (US$141.76) from 19,500 yen
($128.57) a day earlier. Volume surged to 116,900 shares,
more than five times the daily average of the previous month.
   A spokesman for Long-Term Credit Bank said he knew of no
investigation centering on improper trading in the bank's
shares. He denied the possibility of insider trading, saying
the bank was meticulous in the disclosure of information
about the share split.
   There have been no prosecutions under the insider-trading
law, which imposed the first legal sanctions on the practice
here.
