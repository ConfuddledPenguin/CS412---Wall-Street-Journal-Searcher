   OTTAWA -- A Canadian parliamentary committee unanimously
recommended a plan to overcome a Canadian constitutional
impasse that has revived independence demands in Quebec.
   The impasse arose over proposed constitutional amendments
that would recognize Quebec, a largely French-speaking
province, as a "distinct society" within Canada and grant new
powers to provinces in areas such as immigration.

   Much of the public's opposition to the changes has focused
on the proposed distinct society designation for Quebec, even
though constitutional lawyers have questioned whether the
clause would have much legal meaning.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said designating Quebec a
distinct society doesn't mean the province "is privileged or
gains any special powers. It simply confirms the obvious:
that Quebec is different and that that difference is very
much worth conserving."
   The parliamentary committee, which held public hearings
across the country, said the constitutional proposals, known
as the Meech Lake Accord, should be left intact and ratified
by June 23, a legal deadline. But the panel also recommended
that the federal Parliament and the 10 provincial
legislatures also adopt a companion resolution addressing
concerns about the proposed distinct society designation for
Quebec and other constitutional issues.
   The parliamentary committee said that although the
distinct society clause won't give Quebec any additional
powers, the companion resolution, to allay public concern,
should declare that the province's special designation "in no
way" infringes the constitution's charter of rights.
   Mr. Mulroney said that "what is in dispute over the Meech
Lake Accord is very modest." But he said sentiment is so
strong that "the stakes involved in our constitutional
deadlock are enormous." The Meech Lake Accord, which was
negotiated in 1987 at Meech Lake, Quebec, was designed to
meet Quebec's "minimum" constitutional demands.
   A public opinion poll published earlier this week said 60%
of Quebecers now favor Quebec's becoming politically
independent while maintaining "an economic association with
the rest of Canada."
   The parliamentary committee's proposals provide a basis
for a resolution of the constitutional dispute by the federal
and provincial governments, said the committee's chairman,
Jean Charest. Three provinces, Manitoba, Newfoundland and New
Brunswick, oppose the Meech Lake Accord.
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said the committee has
made some recommendations that "point in a helpful
direction." New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna also welcomed
the committee's report, saying it addressed New Brunswick's
concerns.
   Mr. Mulroney said he will "spare no effort to develop a
consensus and break the deadlock, if at all possible." But he
said he would call the provincial leaders to a constitutional
conference only if "there are reasonable prospects of
success."
   The parliamentary committee's recommendations included a
new, more flexible constitutional process for revising the
federal Senate, the appointed chamber of Parliament. Senate
overhaul is a major goal of several provinces.
