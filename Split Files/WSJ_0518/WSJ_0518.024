   INDIANAPOLIS -- Central Newspapers Inc., beset by a soft
advertising market, expects that 1990 revenue will match
year-earlier levels but that earnings are likely to decline,
President and Chief Executive Officer Frank E. Russell said.
   In 1989, the company had record net income of $38.5
million, or $1.45 a share, on record revenue of $436.2
million.

   Mr. Russell also said Central is negotiating over the
possible purchase of two newspapers on the West Coast, but
declined to disclose any details. He did say, however, that
"If these talks aren't concluded in 1990," there won't be a
deal.
   Central, which went public in September 1989, draws the
bulk of its revenue from its daily newspapers in Phoenix,
Ariz., and Indianapolis. In addition, it operates smaller
papers in two Indiana towns, and a Phoenix business weekly.
   "We expect ad linage to be flat or down," in the current
year, Mr. Russell said. This will be partly offset by price
increases for advertising, he said. He declined to provide
specific earnings projections.
   H.D. Brous &amp; Co. analyst Howard Rosencrans says he expects
Central's pershare earnings will slip 25 cents to $1.20;
other analysts projecting a smaller decline of 5-10 cents a
share are "too optimistic," he says.
   Many newspaper publishers have seen advertising linage
decline since mid-1989 amid a weakening economy.
   There had been speculation that Central might try to cut
costs by folding morning and afternoon papers into one paper
in each of its principal markets. But Mr. Russell said
Central has "no plans whatsoever" to carry out such a
consolidation. "Like all other metro papers," he added,
"we're watching our costs closely, and will continue to do
so."
   Indianapolis has fared better than many Midwestern cities,
which were more damaged by the protracted erosion in
smokestack industry jobs. But the once-booming Sunbelt town
of Phoenix, site of Central's other principal operation, has
seen its economy significantly weaken in recent years. Some
analysts have said that Central's profitability hinges on a
resurgence of the Arizona city's fortunes. Mr. Russell said
"all the experts I talk to" have pushed back their
projections for a comeback to 1991 from earlier expectations
of a rebound for the city this year.
   Mr.Russell says he's confident the historically
up-and-down Arizona economy will snap back again: "We're
betting $128 million on it," he added, in a reference to a
second printing plant on which Central recently began
construction in suburban Phoenix. The city's morning and
Sunday papers are "still showing growth," he said, and the
added capacity will come on line in 1992 "just in time" to
avoid any production undercapacity.
   Brous &amp; Co.'s Mr. Rosencrans says that, when the city's
upturn does occur, Central is "ideally positioned to
benefit."
   Central's damped advertising revenue has been partially
offset by lower costs for newsprint. Mr.Russell says he
thinks the newsprint industry's plans to raise prices in June
by $35 a ton, or about 5%, will hold, although he noted that
other publishers think it might fail, or deteriorate to a
smaller increase.
