   CAMDEN, N.J. -- Campbell Soup Co. reported a 25% increase
in third-quarter earnings as improved cost controls in North
American operations and higher profits in Argentina offset
continuing problems in the U.K. and Europe.
   In the third quarter, ended April 29, the food company
earned $54.6 million, or 42 cents per share, on sales of
$1.52 billion. In the 1989 quarter, net income was $43.5
million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $1.45 billion.

   Campbell International's operating earnings were up 45%,
to $16.7 million, compared with last year's third-quarter
profit of $11.5 million. Sales for the division were $460
million, compared with $418 million a year ago. Profitability
improved in Campbell's Argentine beef operations, but the
company said its British frozen-food unit and Italian biscuit
operations continued to have "earnings difficulties."
   The company's largest division, Campbell U.S.A., reported
a 10% increase, to $91.3 million, in third-quarter operating
earnings, up from $83 million last year. Sales for the
division, which makes such products as V8 vegetable juice,
soup and Prego spaghetti sauce, were $881 million, up only
4%, from $847 million last year. Campbell attributed the slow
sales growth to general weakness in retail sales and an
unusually warm winter soup season.
   Nine-month earnings were $242.8 million, or $1.87 per
share, on sales of $4.77 billion. In the 1989 period,
Campbell earned $207.8 million, or $1.61 per share, on sales
of $4.37 billion.
