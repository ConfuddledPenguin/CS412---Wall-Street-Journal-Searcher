   WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee, in a sudden
burst of fiscal austerity, decided to freeze subsidy rates
for major agricultural commodities at current levels for the
next five years.
   The committee, meeting behind closed doors, rescinded more
than $10 billion in farm spending increases approved at the
subcommittee level.

   The committee members, led by Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas), also agreed to give farmers a free hand to plant
whatever crops they want on 20% of the land they customarily
devote to cotton, rice, wheat, feed grains and oilseed crops,
such as soybeans and sunflowers. But farmers who took
advantage of this planting flexibility provision wouldn't be
eligible for subsidy payments on that land.
   At the same time, the committee agreed to inaugurate a
so-called marketing loan for soybeans and other oilseed
crops, but with a proviso that the new price-support program
would operate at no cost to the government.
   The committee's objective is to hold farm spending from
fiscal 1991 through 1995 to $53 billion, roughly what would
be spent if current farm law were extended for five years.
With the exception of a projected $1.5 billion increase in
dairy subsidies, it appears as though the farm lawmakers will
succeed for the most part, according to House Agriculture
Committee staff members.
   Rep. Jerry Huckaby said agreement was almost unanimous on
the five-year package, which will be put to a formal vote
next week, probably Tuesday. "The intention of our committee
is to take to the floor a bill that can be passed," the
Louisiana Democrat said. "This is a budget that isn't
excessive."
   To save money, the committee members put aside plans to
tie so-called target prices for commodities to either farm
production costs or the consumer price index. Instead, they
agreed to freeze the target prices for cotton and rice at the
fiscal 1990 levels, 72.9 cents a pound and $10.71 a hundred
pounds, respectively. Target prices for corn would be frozen
at $2.75 a bushel and wheat at $4 a bushel.
   Under the farm program, the government pays farmers
so-called deficiency payments, or subsidies, if market prices
fall short of target prices.
   The committee has yet to make adjustments on oats and
barley subsidies, but it isn't likely to stick with a plan to
boost price supports for these feed grains by $1.5 billion
over five years.
