   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Arizona Commerce Bank said it was
ordered by state bank regulators to increase its primary
capital at least $2 million to about $7 million within six
months.
   The order also sets a schedule for reducing the bank's
problem loans by certain amounts, Arizona Commerce said. Like
many other financial institutions in the state, Arizona
Commerce is suffering from bad real-estate loans.

   Arizona Commerce also said its board has consented to an
order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with
"substantially identical provisions" to the state order.
   Such orders can be in effect for "30 days to 10 years,"
said F. Lee Jacquette, Arizona Commerce chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Jacquette said "it's possible, but difficult to raise
the additional capital because so much of the country sees
Arizona as a black hole because of the real-estate problems."
Most large Arizona banks are owned by out-of-state companies
that have come to the aid of the banks with capital
infusions, he said.
   Last year, Arizona Commerce Bank posted a loss of $5.6
million, or $2.27 a share. "We're still losing money because
so many of our loans are non-performing and aren't paying
interest," Mr. Jacquette said. Arizona Commerce has offices
in the Arizona cities of Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa.
