   The trustee for the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway said the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., approved Canadian
Pacific Ltd.'s offer of $25 million for assets of the
railroad, which is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Francis Dicello, the trustee, said the agreement is
subject to negotiation of labor agreements and to regulatory
approval. He said the Bankruptcy Court asked the Interstate
Commerce Commission to render a decision on the transaction
within 90 days of submission.

   Delaware &amp; Hudson owns about 600 miles of track in New
York and Pennsylvania and has rights to run its trains on an
additional 900 miles of track.
   Mr. Dicello said Canadian Pacific's plans to rehabilitate
the line and increase freight traffic over it will increase
rail competition in the Northeast. Delaware &amp; Hudson provides
some of the last remaining rail competition in the Northeast
to Consolidated Rail Corp., the Philadelphia-based railroad.
   The agreement includes commitments for capital
improvements to the Delaware &amp; Hudson of $3 million from New
York and $5.5 million from Pennsylvania, Mr. Dicello said.
   Canadian Pacific is a Montreal transportation, resources,
telecommunications and real estate concern.
