   Texas Instruments Inc. said it will reduce its defense
systems work force by about 1,000 employees over the next
year in response to reduced defense spending.
   The Dallas-based semiconductor and defense concern said
that all its Defense Systems and Electronics Group sites,
which employ about 22,000 people, will be affected by the
decision.

   Texas Instruments said it expects the overall financial
impact from the reductions to be minimal.
   The company also announced it agreed with a unit of the
Netherlands' N.V. Philips to swap designs for a group of
computer chips called bus-interface logics.
   Under the agreement, Texas Instruments and Philips
Components-Signetics will make and sell each other's
bus-interface chips, which act as go-betweens in computers,
allowing chips to communicate with each other and to outside
equipment such as telephone lines.
   Texas Instruments estimates the world market for
bus-interface chips at about $850 million.
