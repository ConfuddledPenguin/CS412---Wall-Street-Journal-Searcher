   WASHINGTON -- The words "Social Security" never seem to
provoke clear-headed thinking in Congress, and this year is
no exception. With surprisingly little debate and less
deliberation, Congress and the administration have all but
agreed to take Social Security out of the official
calculation of the budget deficit. "We're going to take
Social Security off budget," says Sen. Pete Domenici, a New
Mexico Republican. "There's no doubt."
   Many Democrats and some Republicans talk about balancing
the budget over the next several years without counting the
annual Social Security surplus. But considering their
inability to make progress toward a balanced budget even with
the $63 billion Social Security surplus, it's a pipe dream.
"Macho talk," says House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, a
California Democrat.

   Nevertheless, in the Washington political hothouse,
rhetoric has a way of driving policy, and the rhetoric
surrounding Social Security is thick. Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a
New York Democrat, started all this when he accused his
colleagues and the president of "thievery" by relying on the
regressive Social Security payroll tax to fund other
operations. The competition to talk tough on Social Security
has escalated since.
                                                                                                       

   This isn't simply a matter of accounting. Some experts to
whom Democrats usually turn say that taking Social Security
off budget could prove to be the biggest blunder Democrats
make this year. While politicians love to proclaim that they
have "protected" Social Security, these experts look beyond
oratory and don't like what they see. "Democrats are shooting
themselves in the foot by supporting this," asserts Isabel
Sawhill of the Urban Institute.
                                                                                                       

   For one thing, segregating Social Security would make
cutting the deficit much tougher. The program is at the root
of the surge in spending of the past two decades -- from 15%
of the budget in 1970 to 21% today. Budget experts long have
assumed that any deficit fix would include restraint in the
growth of benefits for older folk.
   By removing Social Security from deficit totals, however,
the budget summiteers would eliminate any incentive to trim
the program. "If it's not part of the problem, it's not part
of the solution," says Robert Reischauer, director of the
Congressional Budget Office. So much for promises about
sharing the sacrifice of deficit reduction.
   Social Security beneficiaries won't object, of course. But
with such a big piece of the budget exempt, the rest of it
would get squeezed all the harder to reduce the deficit.
Higher taxes and lower defense spending wouldn't suffice;
popular spending programs such as the war on drugs and
federal aid to education would surely suffer. Congressional
advocates of taking Social Security out of the budget "don't
realize what a terrific crimp it'll put on domestic
spending," Ms. Sawhill says.
   Moreover, removing Social Security from the budget might
weaken rather than strengthen the hallowed trust fund.
Currently, Congress can't tap Social Security funds without
increasing the deficit and risking the Gramm-Rudman law's
across-the-board spending cuts; this has kept Congress from
raising benefits for certain age groups or using Social
Security taxes to pay for long-term health care.
   If Social Security is removed from the budget, however,
the limited discipline of the Gramm-Rudman law would
disappear. Mr. Reischauer says the Social Security trust fund
could become a "honey pot" that legislators would dip into to
provide more benefits to seniors, weakening the trust fund's
ability to cope with baby-boomer retirees in the next
century.
                                                                                                       

   To take Social Security off budget could be a recipe for
the failure of the budget summit. The spending cuts and tax
increases required to balance the budget without Social
Security anytime soon could prove politically impossible. For
this reason, White House Budget Director Richard Darman keeps
urging the summit to agree on a deficit-reduction package and
then to write new accounting rules to accommodate it.
                                                                                                       

   Given the pitfalls, why is Congress so determined to take
this step?
   Many members want to boast that they've protected Social
Security without having to vote for the costly payroll tax
cut proposed by Sen. Moynihan. And some Republicans suspect
that Democrats are trying to make the deficit look huge so
President Bush will have to raise taxes. Another theory has
Democrats using the Social Security move as a wedge to weaken
or eliminate the Gramm-Rudman law and thus avoid the pain of
deficit-reduction altogether.
   Conventional wisdom to the contrary, politicians often do
what they promise. But if they take Social Security off
budget, they may come to regret it.
