   NEW YORK -- Discount broker Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc.
boosted, to 44 cents a share from 34 cents, its projection of
the acquisition-related charges it will take for the fiscal
year ending Feb. 28.
   The company had made the 34-cent estimate in late March,
but it said last week that that number reflects only the
costs of the acquisitions by its JJC Specialist Corp. The
revised charge reflects costs of all of Quick &amp; Reilly's
acquisitions for fiscal 1991.

   The estimated charges are net of any tax benefits the
company might receive from the acquisitions.
   Quick &amp; Reilly also expects to report that per-share
earnings for the first quarter, ended May 25, were flat at 31
cents. Earnings for the year-earlier period were $2.9 million
on revenue of $24.4 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Quick
&amp; Reilly fell 25 cents to $15.25.
