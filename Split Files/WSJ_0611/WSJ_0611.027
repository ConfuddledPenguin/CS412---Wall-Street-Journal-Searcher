   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- McDonald's Corp., apparently feeling
the heat of critics who contend that customers often forsake
nutrition for speed in fast food, will begin posting charts
with ingredients information.
   The 3-by-3-foot posters will summarize nutritional data
that have been available in 56-page booklets in the company's
restaurants for more than two years. Food tray liners also
will display appropriate menu information by the time of day;
for example, the contents of the breakfast-time Egg McMuffin
will be on tray liners used in the mornings, while that of
the Big Mac burger will appear later in the day.

   "A lot of special-interest groups are anxious for us to
tell all. We've been trying, but they never seem to be
satisfied," Edward Rensi, president of McDonald's USA, said
in an interview. "So we thought we'd take an extra step and
put the information on {posters} so they can walk up and read
it" on a wall.
   "We're very proud of our food and spend a lot of time and
effort making sure it's as nutritious as it can be," Mr.
Rensi added, suggesting that competitor fast-food chains, and
even four-star restaurants, follow suit so customers know
what they're ordering.
   Mr. Rensi denied that McDonald's, the world's largest
restaurant company, was reacting to recent harsh criticism of
its menu. In April, a Nebraska
businessman-turned-cholesterol-fighter, Phil Sokolof,
lambasted the chain in full-page newspaper ads for
contributing to what he termed "the poisoning of America."
Mr. Sokolof was particularly critical of the cholesterol and
fat content of the food at McDonald's and other unidentified
fast-food chains.
   McDonald's attacked the ad as "reckless and misleading,"
but perhaps coincidently said the company was reformulating
its milk shakes to go to a lower-fat content, and was phasing
out the use of beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat,
in cooking french fries.
   The nutrition posters will begin appearing next month,
although some McDonald's stores have displayed content
analysis alongside their menus for months.
   "We think we've got a damn good nutrition story to tell,"
Mr. Rensi said, contending that if patrons began comparing
the content of McDonald's menu with that of competitors, it
would "ultimately help our sales -- unless they change their
menus."
   Quoting what he said is a nutritionist, Mr. Rensi said,
"`There are no junk foods, there are only junk diets.' Our
position is, everything in moderation. You ought to have a
balanced diet. You ought to eat cherries, pears, beans, Big
Macs, milk, bread. . . ."
   Although his company is going to put up wall posters, Mr.
Rensi said restaurant help is seldom asked nutrition
questions or about menu ingredients. "The people who are
really interested in this already have the information," he
said.
