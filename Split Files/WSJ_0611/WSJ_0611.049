   NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Daiwa Securities Co.
said it named Stephen W. Bradley, a former managing director
at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s capital markets group, as an
executive vice president and co-head of its new capital
markets operations.
   The Japanese securities firm also said that it planned to
add 30 to 50 people over the next year to increase its U.S.
presence in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, real
estate, foreign exchange, and mortgage-backed securities.

   As is the custom at many Japanese financial institutions,
Mr. Bradley will share the top title of his unit with a
Japanese executive. But Daiwa officials said that, in
practice, the 45-year-old American, a specialist in taxable
debt instruments, effectively would run the firm's capital
market operations. His appointment takes effect tomorrow.
   In eight years at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Bradley was mostly
involved in evaluating and structuring debt transactions for
big multinational corporations and foreign governments.
Before joining Merrill Lynch in 1982, he worked for 14 years
at PaineWebber Inc.
   Two-and-a-half years ago, Mr. Bradley established a unit
at Merrill that specializes in putting together debt
offerings for foreign companies and governments. But when
that unit was moved to London at the beginning of this year,
he chose to remain in New York. He said that while he was
offered other positions at Merrill in New York, he decided to
look elsewhere.
   "While leaving the capital-markets opportunities at
Merrill Lynch was difficult, I find the opportunities at
Daiwa challenging and unlimited," said Mr. Bradley.
   In the past, Daiwa and other big Japanese firms have had
difficulty cracking the U.S. corporate finance market,
particularly because of stiff competition from American firms
determined to protect their own turf. In addition, the
Japanese didn't have strong ties to U.S. companies, couldn't
match the ability of U.S. firms to develop sophisticated
products and had trouble retaining talented American
professionals.
   Some investment bankers also questioned the Japanese
firms' commitment to the U.S. market. For instance, Daiwa in
November 1988 laid off about 10% of its professional staff in
the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. Some of those cuts
were in fields the firm now plans to beef up, particularly
corporate bonds and mortgage-linked securities.
   But Daiwa now sees the large cutbacks taking place on Wall
Street as an opportunity to pick up American talent that
otherwise hadn't been available. A Daiwa spokesman said that
most of the 30-to-50 new hires would be professionals. The
U.S. unit currently employs about 370 people.
   Unlike some other big Japanese brokers -- such as Nomura
Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. -- Daiwa has
refrained from expanding in the U.S. by purchasing stakes in
American firms that specialize in areas such as mergers, real
estate, leasing and money management.
   With an infusion of $100 million two weeks ago from its
Tokyo parent, Daiwa's U.S. subsidiary now has slightly more
than $300 million in capital. The parent company has the
equivalent of $6.2 billion in shareholder equity, making it
one of the world's most heavily capitalized securities firms.
