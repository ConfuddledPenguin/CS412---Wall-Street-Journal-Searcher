   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. said its board approved an amendment
of its dividend reinvestment and stock-purchase plan that
ends, effective immediately, the discount on reinvested
quarterly cash dividends.
   The plan, which was started in 1979, offered a 5% discount
on reinvested dividends. A spokeswoman for the metals and
energy company said the action was taken to protect long-term
holders and to "reduce certain abuses" of the program,
including arbitrage, excessive trading or transaction profit
activities.

   Several companies, particularly banks, have been changing
their dividend reinvestment programs. Typically,
institutional investors buy up blocks of a company's stock
before the dividend is declared to take advantage of the
reinvestment discount, then sell soon after, which drives the
share price down.
   Amax said that as of March 1, 42% of eligible shareholders
participated in the plan. A total of 27% of the 87.4 million
shares outstanding participated. The last regular quarterly
dividend of 20 cents a share was payable June 1 to stock of
record May 10. The next regular dividend is payable Sept. 1
to stock of record Aug. 10.
