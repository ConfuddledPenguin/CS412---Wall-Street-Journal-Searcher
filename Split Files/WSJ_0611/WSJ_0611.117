   NEW YORK -- American International Group Inc. said it
agreed to acquire Fischbach Corp. through a subsidiary in an
exchange of stock valued at $11 a Fischbach share, or about
$44 million.
   AIG, a New York-based insurer, disclosed last month that
it was considering such a purchase. The company is
responsible for a large portion of the performance bonds for
Fischbach, an electrical and mechanical contracting concern.

   About $600 million of performance bonds have been issued
to the New York-based contractor. The acquisition is widely
viewed as an effort by AIG to protect itself from potentially
large performance-bond claims.
   In connection with the transaction, AIG said it exercised
an option to acquire, at $11 a share, the 54% stake in
Fischbach held by APL Corp., which is controlled by Miami
financier Victor Posner.
   AIG said APL held a total of 2,068,370 shares of Fischbach
common, as well as about $6.5 million principal amount of
Fischbach convertible subordinated debt.
   In a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, AIG disclosed that it also formed a business
relationship with Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons Inc., a privately held
construction company based in Omaha, Neb., that is expected
to provide management consulting services to Fischbach.
