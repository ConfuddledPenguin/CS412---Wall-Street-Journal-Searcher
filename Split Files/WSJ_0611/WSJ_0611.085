   General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. said
they probably will face second-quarter write-offs because of
delays in developing the A-12, the U.S. Navy's highly
classified, next-generation attack airplane.
   Neither defense contractor would spell out the potential
size of the charge or the reasons for the setback. But
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the companies
apparently were encountering problems with the composite
materials that will give the A-12, known as the Avenger 2,
its stealthy characteristics. The Navy, which is now
conducting a special review of the project at the instigation
of the companies, said specifically that there have been
difficulties in setting up the tooling to manufacture the
aircraft.

   "This is an enormous program, at the very edge of the
limits of technology," Jim Cunnane, General Dynamics's chief
financial officer, said. "We can go racing on through the
thing, or we can slow it down and . . . reduce the technical
risks."
   But the companies also seem to be scrambling to mitigate
their financial risks. Lawrence Harris, who has closely
tracked the A-12 as aerospace analyst for Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles, pointed out that the
companies may rapidly be approaching the $4.8 billion
cost-ceiling on their fixed-price-incentive development
contract -- after which they must absorb any overruns.
   Last week, according to the Navy, General Dynamics
temporarily laid off about 60 employees at Air Force Plant
No. 3 in Tulsa, Okla., the final assembly location for the
A-12. "Additional manpower reductions by General Dynamics and
McDonnell Douglas may be required to control costs associated
with the change in schedule for the aircraft's first flight,"
a service spokeswoman said.
   Separately, General Dynamics said last week that it will
lay off between 500 and 800 employees in the next two months
at its Fort Worth, Texas, fighter division as part of a
previously announced plan to reduce employment at the
division by 7,000 by the mid-1990s.
   Mr. Harris also said the $1.5 billion in revenue that the
companies had expected to split evenly this year from the
A-12 could be reduced as a result of the delay in the first
flight. He said the firms, both based in St. Louis, took in a
combined $900 million last year from the program.
   Neither McDonnell Douglas officials, Mr. Cunnane nor John
Lamers, the A-12 program manager in Fort Worth, would
disclose exactly when they had been expecting the airplane to
be ready for use. However, McDonnell Douglas indicated that
the milestone has been postponed "beyond early 1991 until
later the same year."
   The news of the A-12 comes atop a recent disclosure that
another high-cost aircraft, the Air Force's Advanced Tactical
Fighter, also will have its first flight delayed. That's
because of snags with the engines.
   The A-12, which is set to replace the aging A-6 Intruder
fighter-bomber by the mid-1990s, is one of the nation's most
expensive weapons programs with a $52 billion price tag. It
is also the Navy's top priority to deploy the aircraft, and
the military expects to buy about 620 A-12s in all.
   John Betti, the Defense Department's acquisition chief,
said in a statement that he was "very concerned" about the
A-12. Sources said he was taken aback by the contractors'
admission of the problems and questioned why they hadn't
surfaced during the Pentagon's major aircraft review, which
Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney delivered to lawmakers in
April. The review had suggested "everything was on track and
on time," one official said. "Now, if the schedule slips and
the price goes up, it could become real controversial on the
Hill."
   Mr. Cunnane stressed that it was impossible at this point
to figure how big a hit to earnings his company might be
forced to take, explaining that General Dynamics's executives
would meet among themselves to determine new scheduling and
cost projections. "It will be a couple of weeks before we
come to grips with what the implications of the problem are,"
he said.
   In the year-ago second quarter, General Dynamics had net
income of $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share, on sales of $2.53
billion. McDonnell Douglas, stung by a $72 million write-down
to reflect cost overruns on its C-17 cargo plane, had a net
loss of $48 million on revenue of $3.48 billion.
   The companies made their announcements about the A-12 late
Friday, after the final bell at the New York Stock Exchange,
where General Dynamics finished in composite trading at $36,
up 12.5 cents. McDonnell Douglas closed on the Big Board at
$45.875, up 12.5 cents.
   The Navy said its review of the A-12 program will
encompass design, cost and production scheduling, as well as
Navy funding and "contractor performance." The Navy is set to
complete its review this month.
   "To the extent that the program changes," Mr. Cunnane
said, "we're looking to the Navy to cover the cost."
   To some degree, that is analogous to Lockheed Corp.'s
experience on the P-7 anti-submarine aircraft. The Calabasas,
Calif., aerospace concern took a $300 million write-down last
year after it made a miscalculation on the design of the
plane. Now, it's in negotiations with the Navy to
re-establish cost and scheduling formulas.
   But Mr. Cunnane insisted that the A-12 mess didn't result
from any earlier design deficiencies. "What this does is put
the emphasis on technical success," rather than on timing, he
said.
