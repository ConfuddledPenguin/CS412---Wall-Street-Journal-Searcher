   Sales increased 16% to 201.26 billion yen from 173.54
billion yen.
   Sales of robots and related equipment grew 20% to 100.516
billion yen, helped by brisk demand for industrial robots.
Manufacturing systems sales rose 10% to 32.95 billion yen,
because of increased investment in facilities by the steel
and the paper and pulp industries. Sales of heavy electric
machinery increased 7.9% to 62.89 billion yen.
   Yaskawa predicted consolidated pretax profit for fiscal
1991 will increase to 10.2 billion yen, an indicated rise of
9.3%. Net income is expected to rise to 4.2 billion yen, or
13%, and sales to 221 billion yen, or 9.8%.
