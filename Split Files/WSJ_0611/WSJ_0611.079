   TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- A faulty Toyota pickup design was
cited as a jury awarded $5,270,000 to a woman for injuries
suffered in a 1984 accident.
   Officials with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., a
subsidiary of Toyota Motor Sales Ltd., said the award was one
of the largest ever imposed against the company. Attorneys
for the company said an appeal would be filed.

   The Superior Court jury also awarded $100,000 to the two
daughters of Cynthia Gosper, 35 years old, of Garden Grove,
Calif., who was left a quadriplegic from the accident. The
daughters suffered minor injuries in the same accident.
   Jurors found that a design flaw in the 1981 4-wheel-drive
SR5 pickup Mrs. Gosper was driving allowed it to roll off a
highway after it was struck from behind. The driver's side
door popped open, throwing Mrs. Gosper from the truck.
   Toyota attorneys insisted that the truck's design is safe
and that the force of the collision caused it to roll over.
   Sam Cole, an analyst with the Center for Auto Safety, a
Washington-based consumer group, praised the outcome. "I
think the jury was correct in their decision that the vehicle
was designed in an unstable manner," he said.
