   PARIS -- Henri Martre, chairman of Aerospatiale, said it
would be a good thing for the government to transfer its
controlling stake in Dassault aircraft company to the
state-owned aircraft giant.
   His comments, made during a visit to Turkey, were reported
Saturday by the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
Aerospatiale couldn't immediately be reached for
confirmation.

   Dassault, whose full name is Avions Marcel
Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A., long has been fiercely
independent. Chairman Serge Dassault, son of founder Marcel
Dassault, has repeatedly rejected suggestions that his
fighter-airplane concern should ally with Aerospatiale, a
larger, more bureaucratic company.
   Dassault has been profitable, thanks to French government
orders. But with military tensions declining, Dassault has
had trouble finding fighter-airplane orders outside France.
While the Dassault family owns the majority of Dassault
shares, the government, through double voting rights,
controls the majority of votes at shareholders' meetings.
Such a meeting is scheduled for next week.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement suggested more
than a year ago that Dassault and Aerospatiale seek an
association, an idea that sent tremors through the defense
establishment and eventually was abandoned. But easing
East-West tensions since then has led government officials to
begin rethinking the issue. The company's independent style
has ruffled feathers in the defense establishment. Since
1986, Mr. Dassault has struggled -- so far successfully -- to
keep management control of the family concern.
   "An eventual transfer to Aerospatiale of the state's stake
in Dassault could only help relations between the two
groups," Mr. Martre was quoted by the French news agency as
telling journalists in Turkey. "It wouldn't help
Aerospatiale, but it would help Dassault, and it would help
the French aeronautics industry a lot."
   According to the French news agency, Mr. Martre stressed
that the decision isn't up to him. But he also ruled out
sharing the government's Dassault stake with Thomson S.A.,
the state electronics group, saying "an electronics group
wouldn't bring anything, because this business is radically
different from aeronautics."
