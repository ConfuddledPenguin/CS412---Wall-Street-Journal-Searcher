   Bio-Medicus Inc. said it agreed to be acquired by
Medtronic Inc. under a sweetened bid involving an exchange of
stock.
   Bio-Medicus will swap 3.15 shares of its common stock for
each share of Medtronic. Initially, Medtronic proposed an
exchange rate of 3.3 shares of Bio-Medicus for each of its
shares.

   Bio-Medicus is an Eden Prairie, Minn., maker of blood
pumps used in surgery. Medtronic is a Minneapolis maker of
biomedical devices.
   The companies said the new exchange ratio depends on the
price of Medtronic stock staying between $77.50 and $92. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, however,
Medtronic shares closed at $76.25, down $3.375. In national
over-the-counter trading, Bio-Medicus shares closed at
$23.75, up 62.5 cents.
   The final exchange ratio will be based on the closing
price 10 days before the effective date, which is projected
to be 75 to 120 days from now.
