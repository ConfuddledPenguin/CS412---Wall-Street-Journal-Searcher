   NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its sluggish
pace in April, and remained sharply lower than the
year-earlier level.
   The Conference Board said its help-wanted advertising
index fell to 138 in April, down from 139 in March and 21
points below April 1989.

   The index, a seasonally adjusted indicator of hiring
plans, has remained about the same since February. The index
uses 1967 as a base of 100.
   Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said, "If
business activity is indeed picking up, as we think is the
case, an increase in want-ad volume should start showing up
shortly."
   Regionally, want-ad volume rose in the East South Central
and East North Central areas 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively, but
declined elsewhere.
   Hardest-hit was New England, where help-wanted advertising
has declined 34% in the past year. The Pacific region, down
3.5%, suffered the mildest decline.
   The Conference Board, a business-research organization,
surveys help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major newspapers
every month.
