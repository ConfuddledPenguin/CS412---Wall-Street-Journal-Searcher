   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's gross monetary
reserves eased by 200 million marks to 102.6 billion marks
($60.6 billion) in the week ended May 31, the Bundesbank, the
central bank, said.
   Foreign liabilities rose, however, by 100 million marks to
53.2 billion marks. The bank doesn't publish a figure for net
monetary reserves. But after extrapolation from the available
data, West German net reserves are indicated to have eased by
100 million marks to 49.5 billion marks in the latest week.

   The reserve totals stabilized in the latest reporting
week, after a sharp 1.4 billion-mark increase in the week
ended May 23, when the central bank's coffers were swollen by
interest income received from foreign investments, primarily
its holdings of U.S. Treasury notes.
