   CHICAGO -- A lawyer for Kemper Corp. confirmed published
reports that the U.S. attorney's office is investigating
stock-index futures trades by a former Kemper mutual-fund
manager.
   The inquiry arose from a class-action lawsuit filed in
February 1989 against the company and former Kemper money
manager Thomas A. Richards, who has since left the firm to
start his own business, said Joan Hall, a lawyer for Kemper.

   "They are looking at Tom Richards's trading in stock-index
futures," Ms. Hall said. "I don't think it's appropriate for
me to describe exactly what the company has provided, but
it's an accurate statement to say that we're cooperating
fully."
   Neither Mr. Richards nor his attorney, James Streicker,
could be reached yesterday for comment.
   The civil suit, filed by two shareholders in public funds
formerly managed by Mr. Richards, alleges that Mr. Richards
diverted unprofitable stock-index futures trades to the
funds, while assigning profitable trades to a Kemper employee
profit-sharing account.
   Ms. Hall said she didn't know when federal authorities
began their inquiry of the trades. "We do not think the
allegations have any merit," she said. "We do not think there
was any wrongdoing on behalf of Mr. Richards or anyone else
at the company."
