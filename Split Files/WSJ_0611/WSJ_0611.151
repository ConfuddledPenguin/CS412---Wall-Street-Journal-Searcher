   HONG KONG -- Monetary authorities in Hong Kong have been
pushing up interest rates to clip inflation and slow loan
demand, but economists say that the action so far hasn't
worked and that rates probably will remain high in the months
ahead.
   Interest rates in the British colony are near historic
highs relative to U.S. rates, helping to slow economic growth
in the first half of the year. Yet even with the high rates
and slower growth, demand for loans continues to outstrip
deposit growth, and inflation, now running at an annual rate
of about 9.5%, has slipped only slightly from 10.1% last
year.

   "Interest rates are going to remain at these levels," said
C.K. Law, research director for Bankers Trust Securities
(Pacific) Ltd. "But they've had no appreciable effect."
   Hong Kong interest rates largely follow rates in the U.S.
because the colony's currency is pegged to the American unit
at 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to one U.S. dollar. If rates move
too far above or below those in the U.S., funds quickly flow
in or out of the Hong Kong dollar, bringing rates back into
line. Yet within those limits, the government can exercise
monetary authority, mainly through the money-market
operations of the Exchange Fund, which holds the colony's
reserves.
   Some economists predict that U.S. interest rates will ease
slightly in the coming months, which probably would bring
Hong Kong rates down as well. However, local economists are
more concerned with the gap between U.S. and Hong Kong rates,
and "I don't see that there are clear indications that the
gap is narrowing," Mr. Law says.
   Secretary for Monetary Affairs David Nendick says he hopes
to keep interest rates relatively high "to get inflation out
of the system." Mr. Nendick would like to reduce inflation to
zero, and he says higher interest rates are the way to do it.
   That may be wishful thinking.
   "I don't think the increase in interest rates will have a
very fast or significant effect on the inflation rate," says
Patrick Chan, an economist at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
   One problem is that some of the causes of inflation in
Hong Kong don't respond to higher rates. Rising wages, for
example, are a major culprit. Although the labor market isn't
as tight as it was a year ago, the steady outflow of skilled
workers as Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997
approaches makes it possible for many employees to demand
ever larger pay increases.
   And though the latest official figures show a 1.2%
increase in Hong Kong-dollar deposits in April, double the
rate of growth for both February and March, the statistics
also indicate that loan demand continues to outpace deposit
growth.
   Bankers and economists, who don't expect the trend to
change, have grown alarmed by the rising loan-to-deposit
ratio. "Banks more and more are focusing on their Hong Kong
loan book and wondering how they're going to fund it," said
Peter Franklin, Hong Kong managing director for ANZ McCaughan
Securities (Asia) Ltd., a subsidiary of Australia &amp; New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
   In his annual report in late April, Banking Commissioner
Tony Nicolle warned bankers against allowing the gap between
loan growth and deposit growth to widen. The loan-to-deposit
ratio rose to 121.8% at the end of April from 117% at the
start of the year.
   So long as Hong Kong maintains the currency link, interest
rates can be pushed up only so far to damp loan demand. High
inflation in Hong Kong means that real interest rates, the
difference between the inflation rate and the interest rate,
are a low 2%, which actually encourages borrowing.
   At the same time, signs of increasing demand for Hong
Kong-dollar funds have helped maintain high interest rates.
Many banks and corporations are borrowing now to build
reserves in anticipation of even higher rates once the
government begins financing its massive airport and port
infrastructure projects, probably in 1991.
   Additionally, many foreign banks, particularly Japanese
institutions, are lending to corporations in the colony.
Because very few of these banks have a ready supply of Hong
Kong-dollar deposits, they have been forced to raise funds,
adding to demand.
   Three-month interest rates are now more than one
percentage point higher than those in the U.S., an
historically wide spread, and five-year rates are more than
two points above those in the U.S., compared with only one to
1.5 points at the end of last year.
