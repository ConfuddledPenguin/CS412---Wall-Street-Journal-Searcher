   NEW YORK -- CBS, the only major broadcast network without
a presence in cable television, is negotiating with Discovery
Channel to produce original programming for the cable
channel.
   If an agreement can be reached, the shows would be
produced by CBS News, a unit of CBS Inc. It hasn't been
determined whether CBS would receive payment for the shows,
or whether the No. 3-rated network would ask for a stake in
Discovery Channel.

   A spokeswoman for CBS News said it was "too premature" to
comment on the discussions. Greg Moyer, senior vice president
of Discovery Channel's programming group, said: "The world is
filled with interesting speculation. I can't comment on
that."
   But John Sie, senior vice president of Tele-Communications
Inc., a part-owner of Discovery Channel, said: "We have
discussed projects with each network. There is a possibility
of an equity stake in Discovery, if the project is big
enough. But nothing we've talked about so far is that major."
   The talks come as cable channels are looking for more
original programming. Discovery Channel, for instance, also
has held talks with Public Affairs Television Inc., owned by
commentator and essayist Bill Moyers, for a series. A
spokeswoman for Mr. Moyers's company confirmed that
negotiations were held and would continue.
   ABC News is negotiating with Discovery Channel to
broadcast a co-production venture with Peter Kuhnhardt
Productions for Discovery Channel tentatively titled "Moments
in Crisis."
   According to an individual familiar with the CBS talks,
CBS News, which produces "60 Minutes," "48 Hours" and "Face
to Face With Connie Chung" for the network, is exploring
other "paths of distribution" for additional shows, and is
interested in Discovery Channel, which programs 18 hours a
day and has about 50 million subscribers. The official said
talks have been held irregularly for the past 18 months and
that discussions will continue.
   The official said Laurence A. Tisch, CBS Inc.'s president,
hasn't cleared any cable venture. Mr. Tisch has repeatedly
told CBS affiliates and stockholders that the broadcasting
company would concentrate on its core business, over-the-air
network television, and not cable.
   CBS remains the only broadcaster without cable ventures.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. is a partial owner of two cable
outlets, Arts &amp; Entertainment and the all-sports ESPN.
National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.,
has several ventures, including NBC Cable and a separate
channel titled Consumer News and Business Channel, or CNBC.
   CBS had a loss of $30 million in 1982 with its own tony
advertiser-supported cable channel, CBS Cable, which
specialized in cultural programming. It folded after only 14
months because of lack of advertiser support.
   Discovery Channel, launched in June 1985, is owned by a
group of cable operators: Tele-Communications, United Cable
Television Corp., Cox Communications Inc. and Newhouse
Broadcasting Corp. Its founder and chairman, John Hendricks,
is a partial owner. The channel specializes in nonfiction
shows such as "Mother Nature," "Profiles of Nature" and
"Beyond 2000."
   Discovery Channel's Mr. Moyer said it plans to have
original shows account for 15% of the schedule. "Fifty
percent is acquired from other programmers" unedited, he
said, "and 35% is repackaged under the Discovery umbrella."
   It isn't unusual for a broadcast network news division to
produce shows for cable. ABC News supplies A&amp;E with two
series, "The Eagle and the Bear" and "Heroes." "It adds to
our bottom line," said Irwin Winer, senior vice president of
finance for ABC News.
   In addition, ABC News is to produce six episodes of a new
show on the history of blacks in America for A&amp;E. The series,
"In Search of the Dream," will air in October.
   "Original shows help a cable channel establish an identity
instantly," said Brooke Bailey Johnson, A&amp;E's vice president,
programming and production. "It's terribly important for us
to do as much original programming as possible."
   A&amp;E will air a weekly one-hour series on the record
industry, "Inside Track," with musician Graham Nash, on
Sundays beginning in the fall. The cable channel recently
began broadcasting a weekly one-hour show, "Arts &amp;
Entertainment Revue," produced by King World Productions Inc.
   CBS's discussions with Discovery Channel follow an
agreement between the broadcast giant and Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s Cable News Network to work from the same bureau
in Berlin. Personnel isn't being shared. Other shared bureaus
might follow.
