   RUBLE EXCHANGE RATE

   The international exchange rate for the Soviet ruble
should be made consistent with its real buying power starting
July 1, Soviet Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said in an
interview with the government newspaper Izvestia.
   Mr. Pavlov said the ruble exchange rate should be changed
to reflect its real value before new wholesale prices are
introduced in 1991. Without saying what the changed rate
should be, he said a realistic ruble rate would help the
government to make up losses in revenues caused by production
shortfalls.
   "The federal budget failed to receive three billion rubles
{$4.9 billion} over the past four months," he said. "If this
tendency continues, the losses will have reached 10 to 12
billion rubles by the end of the year."
   Last year, the Finance Ministry established a special
ruble rate for tourists, selling six rubles for one dollar.
The move was an effort to slow down the thriving black market
for dollars.
                                                                                                       

   U.S.-JAPAN SATELLITE ACCORD
                                                                                                       

   Japan and the U.S. signed an agreement on procedures to
allow U.S. companies to expand sales in the Japanese
satellite market. The accord followed a basic agreement
reached in April to allow U.S. satellite manufacturers to
compete on an equal footing for all Japanese government
satellite projects except those for research purposes. Under
the new accord, the Japanese government and its agencies must
announce their plans to buy satellites in official
publications, thus informing potential bidders, the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry said.
                                                                                                       

   INVITATION FOR KLM
                                                                                                       

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines confirmed it has been invited by
Argentina to participate with a group of air carriers and
banks to study the privatization of the Argentine national
airline, Aerolineas Argentinas. The Argentine government has
asked several parties to help with the process. KLM was asked
for either cooperation or participation in the privatization
effort, said a KLM spokesman, adding, "We are just studying
their request." The spokesman said KLM wasn't looking for a
stake in the airline when it is privatized.
                                                                                                       

   LIECHTENSTEIN'S BANKING LAWS
                                                                                                       

   The government of the principality of Liechtenstein
announced it had prepared a draft revision of the tiny
nation's banking laws. Among other measures, the draft
legislation would extend supervision to cover certain
financial companies that have so-called parabank functions.
The government is also preparing other legal measures
designed to prevent misuse of the principality's financial
center. These measures are to cover such activities as
insider trading and money laundering.
                                                                                                       

   FRIENDLY MOVE BY CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China will allow Korea Air Lines, South Korea's national
carrier, to use Chinese air space for regular flights, South
Korean Transport Ministry officials said. China had prevented
KAL from flying through its air space, forcing its flights
from Seoul to the Middle East to detour through Thailand, an
airline spokesman said. The flights over China will begin
Friday night. The KAL spokesman said flying over China would
cut travel time between Seoul and Bahrain by two hours and 50
minutes.
                                                                                                       

   CONCERN IN SINGAPORE
                                                                                                       

   Businessmen in Singapore are concerned about the
increasing cost of doing business there, the outgoing
chairman of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce
said. Boon Yoon Chiang said office rentals in the republic
had increased by 59% in 1989 and are projected to rise a
further 20% to 30% in 1990, while the consumer price index is
expected to rise by 4% in 1990 as there are currently clear
signs of inflationary pressures. Mr. Boon said the business
community is also troubled by a labor shortage.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN POPULATION GROWTH
                                                                                                       

   Australia's population reached 17 million in March,
growing by one million over the past four years.
   The Bureau of Statistics said the previous increase of one
million took nearly five years, and the million added before
that took nearly six years.
   Migration into Australia is running at high levels. Over
the past four years net overseas migration added 500,000
persons, the same number as the natural increase of births
less deaths. Main sources of migrants in the past four years
were Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
   Australia's five major cities account for 60% of the
population, with most of the country sparsely settled.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Guam is offering a pickup truck to the person who can
collect the most brown tree snakes in a one-month period
starting June 23. The 212-square-mile U.S. Pacific island
territory is home to more than two million of the snakes,
which it wants to exterminate because they have decimated the
native bird population. The reptiles were accidentally
imported during World War II, possibly in military shipments
from the Solomon Islands. . . . China's Communist Party
expelled a former vice minister of railways and eight others
in the Railways Ministry for accepting bribes. Luo Yunguang,
the former vice minister, was ousted for accepting a gold
ring, a refrigerator and cash amounting to a bit more than
$600.
