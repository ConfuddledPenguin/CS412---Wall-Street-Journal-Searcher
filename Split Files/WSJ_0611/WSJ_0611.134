   Daihatsu Motor Co., a Japanese auto maker, said its
consolidated pretax earnings for the year ended March 31
tumbled 45% to 8.68 billion yen ($56.9 million) from 15.7
billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income plunged 78% to 1.47 billion yen from 6.67
billion yen.

   Sales rose 1.7% to 766.07 billion yen from 753.1 billion
yen.
   Pretax earnings were hurt by growing marketing and
administrative costs, which rose 5.4% to 120.7 billion yen,
and by nonoperating costs, which surged 39% to 12.39 billion
yen. Extraordinary gains shrank sharply to 336 million yen in
fiscal 1990 from 3.92 billion yen a year earlier, when
Daihatsu sold fixed assets.
   Motor vehicle sales, which accounted for 78% of total
sales, fell 1.2% to 599.22 billion yen, but its parts sales
climbed 12% to 92.17 billion yen. Sales of the company's
other products went up 15% to 74.69 billion yen.
