   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Eduardo Marinho says times here are
tough. So he wants a raise -- of 166%.
   That may seem like a lot, but Mr. Marinho, a 34-year-old
engineer at Light, a Rio electricity utility, says such a
raise would only make up for Brazil's inflation since
February. This inflation, he says, wasn't compensated for in
salaries as in the past because of a wage-and-price freeze
imposed by President Fernando Collor de Mello as part of his
drastic anti-inflation plan unveiled in March. Mr. Marinho,
along with 14,000 other Light employees, went on strike last
week to drive home the wage demand.

   Tens of thousands of Brazilian workers feel the same way,
and are putting increasing pressure on the government to
relax its grip. Strikes are starting throughout the country,
and the powerful left-wing union, Central Unica dos
Trabalhadores, is calling for a broad strike tomorrow.
   The wage issue has become the principal problem facing the
government, and many fear the worsening social climate could
doom Mr. Collor's bold plan only three months after its
inception.
   "There's a general sense that the whole thing is going
down the drain," says economist Edmar Bacha.
   Inflation has been brought down from 84.32% for the month
preceding the plan to 7.9% for May, but there are widespread
expectations that it will soon be back in double digits --
particularly if the explosion of wage claims continues. The
centerpiece of the stabilization plan -- an 18-month freeze
on close to 70% of the money circulating in the Brazilian
economy -- has proved to be ineffective as most companies
have found a way around it.
   Despite pockets of recession, production in many sectors
is approaching pre-plan levels. Some people predict a
consumption boom because the government destroyed faith in
savings, and many economists say the government faces a
difficult choice: more inflation or a deeper recession.
   "Until now, Collor has achieved some results without a
deep recession," says Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank
president. "But now, especially if {wage-and-price}
indexation returns, the only way to avoid a return of
inflation is to follow a very tough monetary policy and
accept a much longer and tougher recession than he thought."
   The most immediate challenge is on wages. When a few
categories of workers got regional labor courts to support
their claims for 166% wage increases, the government, fearful
that this would mean the return of inflationary indexation,
sent Congress a bill that would have deferred all such wage
decisions for six months. But Congress, handing Mr. Collor
his first political defeat, voted down the bill.
   Undeterred, Mr. Collor drew up a similar bill. This was
rejected Wednesday by the Supreme Court on the ground that it
is unconstitutional to resubmit a bill that has been
rejected. Reacting to the second defeat, Economics Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello said not to expect any "measures of
great impact" from the government, but said it would fight
any wage increases through more recessionary policies.
   But many say the government has to take the offensive on
wages if it wants to avoid an inevitable rush of demands
following the Supreme Court decision.
   One solution, many economists suggest, would be to work
out with Congress a wage policy that would allow some form of
indexation on current inflation for low salaries and work out
a timetable to compensate for past residual inflation.
   "They have to pull out some sort of sensible
wage-and-price agreement," says Mr. Bacha. "If they just
leave things open, people will try to grab everything they
can at the first opportunity. Clearly, 166% is a crazy
number, but it's not so crazy if you anticipate a return of
inflation."
   Paradoxically, another factor fueling worry is that the
economy is doing too well. When the government first unveiled
its plan, many economists felt the tight monetary squeeze --
believed to be one of the greatest liquidity crunches in
history -- would trigger a sharp recession. For the first few
weeks, they were right. Activity dropped markedly in the
weeks following the plan. Some entire sectors, such as the
automobile industry, virtually ground to a halt and a number
of industries, such as construction, resorted to mass
layoffs.
   But now, the griping is mostly limited to small companies.
   In most industries the talk of gloom and doom has all but
disappeared -- a sign that the government's liquidity squeeze
failed as companies found loopholes, such as using frozen
funds to pay off taxes, to unblock their blocked money and
relaunch activity. In the auto industry, for instance, Jacy
Mendonca, the president of the National Association of
Automakers, says 1990 production should equal that of 1989,
even though three of the four auto makers operating in Brazil
stopped output totally for five weeks in the wake of the
plan.
   "Business has improved substantially in the past 30 days
and has almost returned to normal," says Andre Beer,
vice-president of General Motors do Brasil. "This is
completely unexpected. If you're being selfish, from a
business point of view that's good," he says. But, he adds,
"we're going back too fast to a 100% level and you can run
into inflation." Since Thursday, however, GM's plant in Sao
Jose dos Campos has been paralyzed by workers demanding the
166% wage increase.
   In a bid to keep production from rising so rapidly and to
crack down anew on excess liquidity, the government has taken
new steps to bring monetary policy in line, including
stringent targets to curb the expansion of money supply and
restrictions on consumer credit.
   The government also vows to forge ahead with its plans to
cut 20% to 25% of Brazil's public sector work force and
publicly offer most of its deficit-ridden state-controlled
companies. Both of these moves are viewed by businessmen as
vital to cutting Brazil's public deficit. But many are
skeptical and question the government's ability to meet its
target of producing a $7 billion public-sector surplus this
year.
   Although the start of the soccer World Cup gives the
government some respite -- Mr. Collor flew to Italy to watch
Brazil's first game yesterday -- it will have to act fast on
the wage and monetary front to quash rising inflationary
expectations.
   The economic minister "is right to say that if we start
giving out 166% increases, we're back where we started from,"
says the president of a European corporation here who
requested anonymity. "But what she says amounts to saying: `I
know you haven't eaten in eight days, but that's not a reason
to eat 16 meals at once.' They'll have a hard time convincing
people."
