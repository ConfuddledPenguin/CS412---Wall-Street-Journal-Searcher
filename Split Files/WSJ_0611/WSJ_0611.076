   The sale is subject to approval by limited partners.
Consolidated Capital Equities, which sought protection under
bankruptcy laws in late 1988, said it expects to mail proxies
to limited partners by mid-July at the latest.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to settle the
company's debts, which are estimated at between $17 million
and $42 million.
