   WASHINGTON -- The National Science Foundation and a
Pentagon research agency awarded a three-year, $15.8 million
contract to the Corporation for National Research Initiatives
to conduct research on a possible, ultra high-speed computer
network.
   Charles Brownstein, the NSF's acting assistant director
for computers, said that partners from private industry,
including the regional Bell telephone companies and
International Business Machines Corp., would chip in "many
times" the amount provided by the federal government. The NSF
is sharing the cost of the contract with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

   Computer researchers hope the small research contract will
be a precursor to a federal effort to build a $390 million
national computer network that would operate at speeds 1,000
times faster than currently possible. In September, D. Allan
Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, urged building
such a network as part of a proposed $1.92 billion initiative
to advance U.S. supercomputing.
   But Mr. Bromley couldn't win any federal funds for his
plan. Administration and congressional sources say he is
pushing hard to get the administration to provide money for
the initiative for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1991.
His plan envisions first-year spending of $151 million for
all supercomputing, including $30 million for the network.
   Unlike many proposals for government financing of
commercial research -- for instance, high-definition
television -- the supercomputing initiative hasn't yet run
into opposition from White House economic officials who
oppose government direction of industry. The computer network
is considered the high-technology equivalent of a public
highway and thus hasn't set off ideological alarms.
   The Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a
nonprofit research organization in Reston, Va., plans to use
the contract money to explore alternative designs for the
proposed national network and ways the network could be used.
   One of the possibilities is putting CAT-scan images on
computers so that surgeons could view the images like a
movie-rotating the images as they like, and visually
stripping away layers of tissue.
   The corporation is run by Robert Kahn, a former Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency manager who helped to
develop the U.S.'s first computer network.
