   A federal judge in Santa Fe, N.M., will be asked this week
to decide whether the Resolution Trust Corp. has the power to
override state laws in the sale of failed thrifts to banks.
   On Friday, the sale of a New Mexico thrift was delayed to
allow the court to decide whether the RTC can sell the thrift
and its out-of-county branches to an Albuquerque bank that,
under state law, must keep its branches within the county of
its main office.

   The issue affects thrift sales in as many as 13 states
where laws restrict, to varying degrees, the ability of banks
to establish branches. Bank commissioners in three of those
states -- Colorado, Arkansas and New Mexico -- have gone to
court to block thrift sales by the RTC, arguing that the
federal agency is running roughshod over states' rights to
enforce their own laws.
   "This will definitely have a national impact," said a
spokesman for the RTC. "From the standpoint of some
acquirors, this is a real cloud."
   The RTC argues that it has the power, under the
legislation that created the agency, to override some state
laws in order to accomplish its job of selling failed savings
and loan associations in the quickest and most cost-effective
way possible. To strengthen its argument, the RTC on June 1
adopted a policy explicitly stating that it can override
state laws.
   The restrictions on bank branches have become a critical
testing ground for that policy because banks have emerged as
the strongest bidders for RTC-controlled thrifts. Few thrifts
have the capital to bid for ailing institutions, although the
thrifts are exempt from branching restrictions in most
states.
   State bank commissioners, who are backed in their fight by
at least two national trade groups, say the standoff can be
resolved by compromise. Illinois, for example, eased its
restrictions last November, permitting banks, who are
restricted from branching, to acquire troubled thrifts that
have branches.
   In states where similar changes aren't contemplated, the
state commissioners suggest that the RTC could sell offending
branches separately -- a move that could slow the sales of
thrifts -- or require the buyer to establish the branches as
separately capitalized banks.
   The latter alternative was used in Colorado this past
January after the state convinced a federal judge in Denver
to grant a restraining order blocking the sale of two thrifts
in Grand Junction to Denver-based Mesa National Bank. In the
face of the order, the bank agreed to establish separate
banks in lieu of branches.
   But in nine similar situations still to be resolved,
Colorado officials aren't betting that many banks will be
willing to accept such a costly compromise. Barbara Walker,
first assistant attorney general in Colorado, said she will
be back in court next week, filing a request that the Denver
judge review the newly adopted RTC policy and rule on its
legality.
   But the first such review will be in New Mexico, with
arguments scheduled for Thursday before U.S. District Judge
Santiago Campos in Santa Fe. The hearing was scheduled after
New Mexico's director of financial institutions, Kenneth J.
Carson Jr., sought a restraining order on Friday to block the
sale of New Mexico Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, which
has $197.4 million in assets, to First National Bank in
Albuquerque.
   The RTC agreed to postpone the sale, pending Judge
Campos's review. Norman Corzine, president and chief
executive officer of First National Bank, said the bank's bid
for the thrift was submitted "on the assumption of a
branch-banking override."
   Now, he says, "we're just observers on the sidelines."
   Meanwhile, First National Bank on Friday did acquire First
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Albuquerque, a $151.5
million thrift with three branches in Albuquerque and one in
Santa Fe. To avoid violating state laws with the Santa Fe
branch, Mr. Corzine said, an affiliate bank, FirstBank Santa
Fe, acquired the branch and its deposits.
