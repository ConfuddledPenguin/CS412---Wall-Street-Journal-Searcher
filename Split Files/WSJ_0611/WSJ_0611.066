   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is looking into possible
irregularities and improprieties in the handling and trading
of U.S. bank loans to borrowers in Latin America, including
Mexico, Fed officials said.
   These inquiries center on the actions of U.S.-based
creditor banks that also at times have involved nationals
from the debtor countries themselves.

   Separately, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
arrived here yesterday on a two-day private visit to the U.S.
to meet with President Bush and to discuss a proposed
free-trade pact with U.S. officials and businessmen. Last
year, President Salinas's government pioneered a landmark
foreign-bank debt settlement, which involved cuts in debt
principal and interest payments, and new loans.
   Several times last spring and summer, Mexican Finance
Minister Pedro Aspe complained to U.S. officials about
suspected financial wrongdoing in the trading of Mexican
foreign obligations, Fed officials say.
   Creditor banks, international companies and other
investors have increasingly traded the foreign obligations of
Mexico and other developing-country debtors ever since the
international debt crisis broke in 1982. In this unregulated
and volatile market, loans customarily trade at big discounts
to face value, and the potential conflicts of interest have
grown for banks that not only trade these credits but also
help to renegotiate them.
   After months of apparent inaction, the Mexican Finance
Ministry last week released details to the Fed of two small
cases involving local companies and nationals who are alleged
to have committed fraud through misuse of Fideicomiso para la
Cobertura de Riesgos Cambiarios, or Ficorca, a government
program through which the foreign bank debt of Mexican
private companies is settled.
   The ministry charged that a Mexican company, Grupo Accion
S.A. de C.V., diverted $8 million in loans from Ficorca to
set up Monytech Inc., a Latin American debt-trading operation
in the Virgin Islands. Eduardo Diaz Rivera Rodriguez, Grupo
Accion's treasurer, also was charged with understating
company income leading to the company's failure to pay 54
million pesos (about $19,000) of tax. The ministry also
presented a separate case against Jaime Ponce Beridgis for
the alleged diversion of $15 million in funds.
   In their public statements about these cases, the Mexicans
didn't mention any foreign banks as being involved. But
foreign banks were originally the holders of private-sector
debt settled through Ficorca, and they often have been
involved in the re-lending of such funds to Mexican
borrowers.
   The Federal Reserve's inquiries however are understood to
be considerably more wide-ranging than such relatively small
Ficorca cases, and they involve examining episodes relating
to several debtor country obligations in addition to Mexico.
A small team that includes banking supervision chief William
Taylor, Fed counsel Virgil Mattingley, and the director of
the international department, Edwin Truman, is understood to
be leading the regulators' inquiries.
   However, when asked for comment yesterday, Federal Reserve
spokesman Joseph Coyne said that he had no knowledge of the
inquiries and declined further comment.
   Since the early 1980s, commercial bank creditors,
international companies and individuals have increasingly
traded the loan obligations of government and company
borrowers from heavily indebted countries in Latin America,
Eastern Europe, the Philippines and Africa. This has led to
the growth of the so-called secondary-loan market, where
annual turnover has now reached into the tens of billions of
dollars. The profits to be made in this market have attracted
investment banks, too.
   Meantime, other units of many of the same commercial bank
creditors also have played a key role in revising terms for
the very loans that are being traded. Big banks have thus had
access to increasing amounts of price-sensitive information
relating to these loans and have faced growing potential
conflicts of interest.
   Big U.S. banks have sometimes moved staff from their
negotiating teams to their trading operations. Traders and
negotiators often have sat in adjoining rooms. At Swiss Bank
Corp.'s New York unit, the same man, Anton Spicijaric, heads
the firm's debt-trading unit and also sits on the committee
that negotiates Mexico's foreign bank debt.
   The practice in debtor countries of allowing foreign banks
to swap loans for local investments also has led to potential
conflicts of interest as banks have been able to reap big
rewards by exchanging old bank debts for local assets.
Advance detailed knowledge of such programs through debt
negotiations, or the ability to get fast local treatment for
a potential exchange of debt through negotiations, can put a
bank in a privileged position if it chooses to trade on these
advantages.
   Prices for developing-country loans have been very
volatile in recent years leading to potentially huge profits
and losses. For example, so far this year, the price for
Mexican government foreign bank debt has risen about 18% to
around 46 cents for each dollar of face value from around 39
cents in January, according to secondary-market traders.
   Information about debt-restructuring negotiations can be
extremely profitable, particularly when the original borrower
was a big private-sector company that may have a bright
future once the debt cloud hanging over it is removed.
   In 1988, the Visa Group, an integrated consumer-products
group that makes some of Mexico's most famous beers,
completed a restructuring of $1.6 billion of its obligations.
These included several hundred million dollars face value of
floating-rate bonds. As the negotiations progressed, the
price for these bonds moved from about 12 cents for each
dollar of face value to around 50 cents for each dollar of
face value in the period from January to August 1988.
   Bankers negotiating the debt restructuring say they became
concerned when it was clear that at least some debt traders
were getting precise details of the restructuring, which only
the negotiating committee and a few Mexican government
officials were privvy to, and were trading on that
information. The details of the restructuring provided strong
indications of the likely direction and value of the debt and
securities of Visa and its subsidiaries.
   Concern among the bank negotiators ran so high that --
after complaints from Paul Friser-Frederiksen, Royal Bank of
Canada's representative on the Visa restructuring committee
-- Michael Chamberlin, a lawyer from the New York firm of
Shearman &amp; Sterling, visited with the bank negotiating
committee in Mexico City to remind the bank negotiators of
their obligations to keep restructuring information
confidential. In recent weeks, Mr. Chamberlin hasn't returned
several telephone calls.
