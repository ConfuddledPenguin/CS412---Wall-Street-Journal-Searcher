   ALBERTO FUJIMORI WAS ELECTED Peru's president over Mario
Vargas Llosa.
   The celebrated novelist conceded defeat soon after
unofficial vote projections gave his rival, an agricultural
engineer and the son of Japanese immigrants, a lead of six to
10 points in the runoff election. The election took place
during the Andean nation's worst economic crisis in this
century and amid a deepening leftist insurgency. Fujimori's
campaign attacked Vargas Llosa's proposal for an economic
"shock" program.

Against Violence. The Communist Party was second with 13.6%,
