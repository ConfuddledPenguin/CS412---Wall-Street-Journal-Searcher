   Stolen-Car Trackers
   Try to Steal the Market

   HIGH-TECH homing devices that help recover stolen cars are
flocking to the market. But consumers might want to hold back
while the nascent industry dukes it out.
   LoJack Corp. of Needham, Mass., sells a system that gives
off a radio signal that can be tracked by police cars
equipped with LoJack receivers. The transmitter, hidden in
the car, is activated by remote control after the owner
reports the vehicle missing. The company, which has sold the
device in Massachusetts since 1986 and has expansion plans,
says 95% of the 1,100 LoJack-equipped stolen cars have been
recovered.
   But a competitor, Code-Alarm Inc. of Michigan, faults
LoJack. Peter Stouffer, vice president of Code-Alarm, snipes
that with LoJack, "when you get back from your trip to
Hawaii, you call." In contrast, he says, Code-Alarm's
"Intercept" system, due for launch in Michigan this month,
will flash tracking signals the moment the car alarm is
tampered with or the ignition is bypassed.
   Meanwhile, Mets Inc. of Indianapolis is launching a system
that uses receivers mounted on a series of towers to zero in
on transmitted signals. James Walker, Mets' executive vice
president, says his company's system is better because it
doesn't depend on police to act as trackers, and can be
adapted to send signals to tow trucks. In Los Angeles,
International Teletrac Systems says it will begin offering a
locator service similar to the Mets system later this year.
   The lack of a standard could thwart the effectiveness of
the systems. "You could steal a LoJack vehicle, and go past a
state police officer {whose agency monitors another system}
and nothing would happen," says Kenneth MacKenzie, a
Richardson, Texas, police detective.
   The LoJack and Mets systems start at about $600, but Mets
will also charge a $10 to $15 monthly fee. Code-Alarm's
device is part of a $1,499 alarm-cellular phone system that
also packs a monthly fee. But Code-Alarm's Mr. Stouffer says
that as technology matures and competition grows, "prices
will drop by half."
                                                                                                       

   With the Power to Sell,
   Survey Pitches a Pitch
                                                                                                       

   IF YOU'VE GOT it, flaunt it.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, the California market research
firm whose annual quality survey sways many a new-car buyer,
is looking to capitalize on its success. This year, for the
first time, J.D. Power is offering companies whose cars
ranked in the top 10 on its quality study the chance to buy a
customized video that dealers can show to shoppers to give
them "an independent, third-party perspective."
   Power is urging makers of top-ranked cars to buy copies of
the videos, which will cost in the area of $50 to $100, and
send them to all dealers. Power isn't publicly saying which
cars are on the list, but says the results were set before
the video marketing began.
   The videos won't say which rank each car earned. But
consumers can rest assured that the company whose car is
named No. 1 will broadcast the fact. After Power dubbed the
Buick LeSabre the top quality U.S.-made car last June, sales
of the model jumped nearly 33% that month and 91% the next.
   Power wanted to keep the study under wraps until July 3 to
give winners time to develop advertising around the results.
But the Detroit News and Free Press spilled the beans
Saturday: Toyota Motor Corp.'s Cressida was the top model;
its Lexus luxury division the No. 1 brand. Buick's LeSabre
was the only Big Three car in the top 10.
                                                                                                       

   `Affordability Index'
   Confirms Racing Prices
                                                                                                       

   DOES IT SEEM that car payments take a bigger bite out of
the monthly budget than a few years ago? David G. Sowerby, an
economist at Detroit's Manufacturers Bank, says it's no
illusion.
   Since 1972, the cost of buying and financing a new car has
gone up faster than the median family income, and Mr. Sowerby
and Manufacturers have developed an "Auto Affordability
Index" to illustrate the imbalance.
   The index is based on 1972, when the cost of the average
new car, including finance charges, was $4,464, or about 40%
of the median family income of $11,126. The Auto
Affordability Index for 1972 was 100. By 1989, the total cost
of the average new car had more than quadrupled to $19,198,
in part because of the cost of safety and pollution-control
equipment. But median income had risen only to $32,487, not
even a tripling. Result: The affordability index plummeted to
67.9.
   Car makers contend that the index doesn't recognize that
consumers are choosing higher-end cars, and getting more car
for the money than 18 years ago.
   But that argument sidesteps the fact that the car market
is stagnating, says David L. Littman, a senior economist for
Manufacturer's Bank. "There are a lot more potential buyers
out there {than in 1972}, yet the market hasn't hit any new
highs," he says. "Much of that has to be laid at the doorstep
of affordability."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   UNDER PRESSURE from New York state, Ford Motor Co. is
dropping a longstanding policy that allowed Ford and
Lincoln-Mercury dealers to refuse to provide warranty repairs
for Ford vehicles they didn't sell. As of Sept. 1, all Ford
dealers nationwide will be required to do warranty work on
any Ford vehicle. New York officials charged that some Ford
salespeople in New York were telling buyers they could get
their cars fixed at another dealership, while service
managers were refusing to take in cars purchased elsewhere. .
. . What do motorists fear the most: Brake failure, according
to a survey by the Allied-Signal Inc. unit that markets
Bendix brakes. So how many of the same car owners say brakes
should be checked regularly? Just 19.6%.
