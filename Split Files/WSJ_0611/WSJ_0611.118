   WASHINGTON -- For most of the nine years since President
Reagan appointed Sandra Day O'Connor the first woman Supreme
Court justice, her importance on the court has been more
symbolic than substantive. But now, as the court heads into
the home stretch of its 1989-1990 term, Justice O'Connor has
emerged in a new and quite powerful role as the critical
"swing" vote, determining just how far the court will go in
its most closely watched and divisive cases.
   In the past 18 months, she has cast the deciding vote to
stop the court from overruling the constitutional right to
abortion; to restrict state and local government
affirmative-action programs aimed at helping minority
businesses; to allow states to execute murderers who are
retarded or who were juveniles when their crimes were
committed; and to brake attempts by conservative justices to
pare down much of the wall between church and state in such
areas as prayer in the schools.

   Her pivotal role is indicative of how conservative the
court has become. Until he retired in 1987, Justice Lewis
Powell occupied the court's middle, often casting the
deciding vote in close cases. His replacement by Justice
Anthony Kennedy coalesced the conservatives, including Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and
Antonin Scalia.
   "As justices more conservative than her have been
appointed, her position has moved to the controlling middle
of the court," says Robert Glennon, a professor at the
University of Arizona Law School. "On a range of issues,
lawyers must pay special heed to making arguments that she
will find persuasive."
   Often, what Justice O'Connor finds persuasive is a
cautious, almost hesitant approach. "Although she is
conservative, she resists doctrinaire and rigid
formulations," says Harvard Law School Prof. Laurence Tribe.
"She's not nearly as tempted as some justices to search for
bright lines. She tries to find manageable, intermediate
principles."
   That sometimes frustrates her more intellectually
venturesome colleagues -- most notably in last year's
historic Webster case. Justice O'Connor voted with the 5-4
majority to uphold Missouri's restrictions on abortion, but
refused to join with the other conservatives to overrule Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing a right to abortion.
   Court insiders say that Chief Justice Rehnquist, trying to
assemble a majority to scrap the so-called trimester system
of abortion regulation established by Roe (which found a
right to abortion within the first three months of
pregnancy), had written a draft opinion specifically aimed at
securing Justice O'Connor's vote. She, though, remained
secretive and didn't respond for weeks. Her conservative
colleagues, left in the dark, nonetheless hoped she was with
them. Then, just days before the decision was released, she
circulated her own opinion, rebuffing the chief justice's
approach.
   Her opinion prompted a vituperative attack on her by
Justice Scalia. Her position, he wrote in his own opinion,
was irresponsible, "irrational," and not to be "taken
seriously." Court sources say Justice O'Connor was both
"hurt" and "peeved" by Justice Scalia's attack, which went
well beyond the usual bounds of public disagreement among the
justices.
   Today, there doesn't seem to be any lasting chill between
the two conservatives. But one justice observes that, in what
may be an ironic response to the flap, Justice O'Connor this
year has seemed if anything even more cautious about joining
particularly strongly worded opinions.
   Nor is she generally comfortable with opinions that seek
to sow seeds of future legal principles, as opposed to
deciding the issue at hand on more narrow terms. Former
clerks say this is one factor that has made her leery of
opinions written by Justice William Brennan, leader of the
court's liberal wing.
   As the only member of the court to have served as a state
legislator -- she was majority leader of the Arizona Senate
-- Justice O'Connor is more consistently willing to defer to
state laws than are any of her colleagues. "She trusts state
legislatures in a way that I doubt any of the other justices
do," says Arizona's Prof. Glennon. Yet she wrote the majority
opinion last year striking down a Richmond, Va., plan to set
aside a percentage of city contracts for minority businesses,
in the process forcing 36 states and some 200 cities and
counties to revamp or abandon similar efforts.
   She has also joined many of the court's opinions aimed at
restricting the rights of accused criminals and at limiting
the number and duration of death penalty appeals.
   It is on issues of religious freedom that she has done
most to stake out her own ground, urging the court to abandon
a rigid three-part test adopted in 1971 to decide whether
various government activities breach the wall of separation
between church and state. She has argued that the three-part
test, which is still technically in effect although losing
support, promotes government hostility to religion, when the
goal of the First Amendment is neutrality.
   Justice O'Connor's view is that as long as government
bodies aren't seen as endorsing religious activities, their
actions ought to be constitutional. On the other hand, she
doesn't go nearly as far as some of the court's other
conservatives, who would give religious practices even more
leeway.
   "Her religion test is the best effort around," says
Harvard's Prof. Tribe. Last week she gained a majority for
her approach for the first time when the court upheld a 1984
federal law requiring public schools to allow religious clubs
to meet on the same terms as other extracurricular
activities.
   Justice O'Connor has generally been part of a majority to
make it tougher for workers to prove claims of employment
discrimination, and to make it more difficult for employers
to justify affirmative-action plans. But she demonstrates a
bit more flexibility when the issue is sex discrimination.
   Such cases inevitably focus more attention on her because
of her symbolic role. For instance, after a federal appeals
court in Chicago last September upheld corporate
fetal-protection policies barring women of childbearing age
from certain hazardous jobs, Judge Richard Cudahy crafted his
dissent as if speaking directly to Justice O'Connor. "Of the
12 federal judges to have considered this case to date, none
has been female," he wrote. The case, he said, "demands" a
woman's "insight into social reality." The Supreme Court has
agreed to rule on the issue in the term beginning in October.
   Justice O'Connor doesn't talk much about how or whether
being a woman affects her court rulings. But on other
matters, she leaves little doubt that she feels keenly the
importance of being the court's first woman.
   When she addressed a recent centennial celebration of the
Los Angeles-based law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, she
recalled having been offered a job there after her 1952
graduation from Stanford Law School -- as a secretary. She
found it ironic that nearly three decades later, a senior
member of the firm, former Attorney General William French
Smith, was instrumental in picking her for the Supreme Court.
   "I can remember when he telephoned to ask me if I could
come to Washington to talk about a position there," she told
the lawyers at the centennial. "I immediately guessed he was
planning to offer me a secretarial position -- but would it
be as secretary of labor or secretary of commerce?"
   She accepts her symbolic role enthusiastically, meeting
with visiting women judges from other countries and
addressing professional women's groups. She encourages the
handful of women law clerks at the court to join the exercise
class she organized, and every year attends an informal,
private dinner with them. "She was very warm, and hugged
people," said one participant last year.
   Last year, Laura Miller, who clerked for Justice White,
met with Justice O'Connor for some career advice. A short
time later, Ms. Miller's phone rang: It was the justice,
saying that if you're going to be a lawyer, you need to dress
like one. Justice O'Connor collected Ms. Miller, drove her to
the store and helped assemble a wardrobe.
   For her own four clerks, she occasionally organizes
outings to see the cherry blossoms, or for a
champagne-and-chocolate picnic at the National Arboretum. She
drops into the clerks' offices to play "Nerf" basketball or
offer late afternoon popcorn. And those who remained in
Washington last Thanksgiving were invited to her house in
suburban Chevy Chase.
   The clash with Justice Scalia notwithstanding, her
personal relationships with the other eight justices are also
warm. On her 60th birthday in March, for instance, they all
sported large buttons bearing her picture that her law clerks
handed out.
   Off the bench, friends and former law clerks say, the
justice is a study in determination. "Whatever it is, she
will enter into it completely," says Nancy Ignatius, a close
friend and frequent tennis companion. This is the case
whether the activity is dancing with her husband, John, a
lawyer who divides his time between Washington and their home
in Phoenix, or whether it is her twice-weekly tennis games,
where the object is to play and win, not spend a lot of time
warming up or talking. She is that way about friendships, too
-- loyal and determined to remember birthdays, kids' names
and other details.
   Determination is also the byword on the job. Early in
1988, when she had an emergency appendectomy, her law clerks
sent work to the hospital. "She'd call and say send more," a
former clerk says. The day before she underwent breast-cancer
surgery later that year, she was driven some 400 miles
round-trip to Washington &amp; Lee University in Lexington, Va.,
to keep a speaking engagement. Ten days after the surgery she
was back on the bench.
   Now, apparently recovered, she puts in 10-hour days, often
eats lunch at her desk, and takes reading home most nights.
She works most Saturdays as well, often cooking lunch for her
clerks (usually tacos or Southwestern fare). She prepares
intensely for the court's 130 oral arguments each term, and
takes an active role in questioning lawyers from the bench.
   Yet in public, particularly when reporters are present,
she is very reserved, almost painfully so. Although she gives
about a dozen speeches a year, she never announces the
occasions to the media or releases texts. "My first year on
the court made me long at times for obscurity," she said in a
speech a few years ago.
   If obscurity is ever possible for a Supreme Court justice,
though, it is impossible for her now. Particularly on
abortion, her every writing and utterance is examined and
parsed by observers on all sides.
   In the cases she has heard thus far, she has suggested a
new, more lenient way of looking at state and federal
regulations, one that would recognize legitimate government
interests in an unborn fetus while deciding whether the rules
impose an "undue burden" on a pregnant woman.
   So far, she hasn't encountered a law that she felt imposed
an undue burden on pregnant women, although she also hasn't
wanted to go so far as to say there isn't a constitutional
right to abortion. Some legislators, like anti-abortion
leaders in Idaho, are trying to pass a statute aimed
expressly at her "undue burden" test. If and when such a law
reaches her, she will finally be put to the test: strike down
the law, or overturn the right to abortion.
   Meanwhile, the court is due to rule any day on whether
states may require that parents be notified before a minor
has an abortion. And next fall, it will hear arguments on the
validity of Reagan-era rules forbidding federally funded
family-planning clinics to counsel women about abortion. None
of the cases are obvious vehicles for overruling Roe, but
they will provide further clues to her thinking.
   So far, says Bruce Fein, a conservative legal columnist,
"she has been disappointing in the abortion area, not only
because of her clear reluctance to overrule Roe, but because
of a certain timidity in her opinions. She hasn't been
willing to take on the core question of whether there is a
constitutional right to privacy." Nonetheless, he and other
conservatives hope "she'll still get to overruling Roe in a
gradual, sequential progression of cases."
   Abortion-rights advocates, meanwhile, find their hopes
pinned to this most unlikely figure. "My assumption is that
she doesn't want to be the fifth vote to overrule Roe," says
Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern
California and former Michael Dukakis campaign manager. Ms.
Estrich and Harvard Law School Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
recently wrote a law review article on abortion that put the
situation bluntly. "Eight men may read our briefs," they
wrote, "but the real audience is one woman."
