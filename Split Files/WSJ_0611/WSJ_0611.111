   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has sold part of its
shareholding in Cie. Industriali Riunite S.p.A. to Sprind
Gestione S.p.A., another company controlled by the Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti.
   Angelo Abbondio, chairman of Sprind Gestione, said in an
interview with the financial weekly Mondo Economico that
Sprind had agreed to buy AT&amp;T's 91 million non-convertible
savings shares for about 250 billion lire ($200.9 million).

   AT&amp;T acquired the stake in Mr. De Benedetti's key
industrial holding company last July in a swap against its
22% stake in Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. S.p.A., the computer
manufacturer controlled by CIR.
   The U.S. telecommunications giant will continue to hold 91
million ordinary shares in CIR, representing 18.6% of its
ordinary capital and worth about 520 billion lire.
   Sprind Gestione is the management company for the mutual
funds of Finanza &amp; Futuro S.p.A., an investment house
controlled by Mr. De Benedetti.
