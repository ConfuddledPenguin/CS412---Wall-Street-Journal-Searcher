   DALLAS -- Lewis Ranieri expanded his Texas thrift empire
into Dallas Friday with the acquisition of Murray Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, a $1.1 billion-asset thrift.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency that took
over Murray Federal a year ago, estimated that the
transaction will cost taxpayers $504 million, including an
initial cash infusion of $467 million.

   Mr. Ranieri already is chairman of United Savings
Association of Texas, a Houston thrift created under the
Southwest Plan of 1988. Murray Federal was acquired by an
institution formed just three weeks ago by Mr. Ranieri's
holding company, USAT Holdings Inc., to purchase a small
Houston thrift.
   The creation of the new thrift enabled Mr. Ranieri to take
on Murray Federal without violating federal policy that
limits the ability of Southwest Plan thrifts to acquire other
institutions. In keeping with the policy, the new thrift will
maintain capital and operations separate from United Savings,
which was acquired in late December 1988 by an investment
group led by Mr. Ranieri. United Savings has $3.5 billion in
assets and $2.6 billion in deposits at 19 branches, most of
those in the Houston area.
   A spokeswoman said United Savings of Texas eventually will
be merged with the new institution, although the timing "will
depend on government policy" and the government's
re-examination of the original Southwest Plan deal.
   Under the Southwest Plan, the now-defunct Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. orchestrated a series of mergers and
sales of failed thrifts in the region. Resolution Trust,
under orders from Congress, is reviewing the Southwest Plan
agreements because of the favorable terms granted some
buyers, including millions of dollars in tax breaks and
protection from losses on existing loans.
   In light of the criticism of those deals, the RTC
initially barred Southwest Plan institutions from acquiring
other thrifts. The agency dropped that restriction in March,
as long as the acquired institution was separately
capitalized and independently operated until the RTC's review
of the buyer was complete.
   USAT Holdings acquired Murray Federal through United
Savings Association of the Southwest which was formed May 14
to acquire Ameriway Savings Association of Houston, its four
Houston-area branches and $218.9 million in deposits. The new
thrift also took on $17.4 million of Ameriway's $136.8
million in assets.
   More significantly, the new thrift allowed USAT Holdings
to gain a valuable toehold in Dallas and its suburbs. Murray
Federal had 17 of its 19 branches in the Dallas area. United
Savings of the Southwest acquired the branches, deposits and
almost two-thirds, or $809 million worth, of Murray Federal's
assets, including cash, securities and performing loans.
   In other RTC actions in Texas Friday, the agency sold East
Texas Savings &amp; Loan Association of Tyler to NCNB Texas
National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. NCNB
acquired East Texas Savings' five branches, $210.3 million in
deposits and just $43.7 million of the thrift's $359.1
million in assets.
