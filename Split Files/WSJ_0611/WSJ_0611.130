   Four companies from Japan, Italy and the U.S. agreed to
build a $7 billion petrochemical project in the Soviet Union
in the largest-ever Soviet-Western joint venture, Japanese
news reports said.
   The companies are Marubeni Corp., a major Japanese trading
house; Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and Italian
chemical companies Montedison S.p.A. and Enichem.

   They agreed with the Soviet Petroleum Industry Ministry to
produce petrochemical products using crude oil from Tengiz,
an oil field just north of the Caspian Sea, the reports said.
   An official at Marubeni declined to comment, saying he has
no knowledge of the project.
   The four companies will invest 49% and the Soviet side
will finance the remainder of the project, the reports said.
