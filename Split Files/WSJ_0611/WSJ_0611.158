   NEW YORK -- R.H. Macy &amp; Co. earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation will be down 20% for the fiscal year
ending July 31, according to company projections.
   The information, contained in a report that Macy disclosed
to various members of the financial community, shows that
earnings before taxes, interest and depreciation will drop to
$743.2 million from $925.9 million a year earlier. Sales are
expected to increase 6.1% to nearly $7.40 billion from about
$6.97 billion a year earlier.

   The profit decline reflects the retailer's disastrous
Christmas quarter, during which earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation fell to $210 million from $391.5
million, a decrease of 46%.
   For the fourth quarter, ending July 31, Macy sales are
expected to climb about 7% to $1.70 billion from $1.59
billion a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation are expected to gain 6.7% to $166 million
against $155.6 million.
   At the same time, Macy projected an upbeat look for the 12
months ending Feb. 2, 1991. During that period the company
believes earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation
will climb 35% to $980.1 million from $726.6 million, while
sales will increase 4.1% to $7.52 billion from $7.22 billion.
   In recent weeks, several credit-related companies
tightened their policies on merchandise shipped to Macy.
   In a speech last week, Edward Finkelstein, chairman, said
there have been reports that Macy may consider the sale of
non-operating assets or an exchange offer, or seek a new
investor. "We are actively examining various opportunities to
reduce and/or refinance our debt," said Mr. Finkelstein. He
emphasized that Macy has ample liquidity to meet its
obligations.
