   In 1994, the national telephone switching network will be
fully digitalized, leading to better transmission and quality
telephone service, he added. "By next year, the capacity of
our international telephone exchanges will be expanded from
4,500 to 10,000 circuits. Plans have also been made for a
third satellite earth station at Seletar. It will be ready by
1995," Mr. Koh said.
   In the past five years Telecom has spent $972 million to
build up telecommunication infrastructure.
