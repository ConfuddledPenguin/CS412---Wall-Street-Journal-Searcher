   Borland International Inc. is seeking to loosen Lotus
Development Corp.'s grip on the spreadsheet market with an
unusual combination of low prices and direct sales.
   Borland, a Scotts Valley, Calif., software company best
known for its programming language, utility and database
products, has sought to woo Lotus customers with a
spreadsheet that can swap information with 1-2-3 files and
can work on older personal computers or less expensive models
outfitted with only bare-bones internal memory. Borland sells
its spreadsheet, called Quattro Pro, for an eye-catching $99
to owners of 1-2-3.

   "The strategy is that we're competing with Lotus
upgrades," which typically sell for less than $150 to owners
of an earlier version of 1-2-3, said Phillipe Kahn, Borland's
chief executive officer.
   Since introducing the new spreadsheet last fall, Borland
has sold more than 200,000 copies. And while its share of the
market remains puny compared with Lotus's stake, Borland is
steadily taking away some sales from its larger rival.
   Two months ago, for instance, Laventhol &amp; Horwath, a
Philadelphia-based accounting firm, purchased 750 copies of
Quattro Pro instead of newer versions of 1-2-3. The company
plans to purchase another 1,000 copies in the next year
because Borland's spreadsheet "enables us to extend the
useful life of our existing hardware," said Alan Urkowitz,
associate director of professional productivity.
   Customers say Borland isn't winning sales on price alone:
its spreadsheet works with the MS-DOS standard but makes
nifty use of graphics and allows data from different
spreadsheet files to be "linked," or exchanged.
   "We still have some {1-2-3} die-hards, but for the most
they've fallen in love with Quattro Pro," said Steven Sheere,
controller at Kwikset, a subsidiary of Black &amp; Decker in
Anaheim, Calif.
   A new study of corporate software buyers lends further
support to the idea that Borland is indeed winning converts
from among 1-2-3 customers. The study, by Emeryville, Calif.,
researcher Techtel Corp., reports that Borland's Quattro Pro
spreadsheet, released last fall, is being purchased by as
many companies as Lotus's 1-2-3 version 2.2, which is the
company's biggest seller.
   Though 1-2-3 outsells Quattro Pro by a wide margin,
Borland "has made a significant breakthrough," said Michael
Kelly, Techtel's president. "No other spreadsheet has matched
the purchase penetration of 1-2-3 in the five years we've
been measuring the market."
   The surge in spreadsheet sales is expected to boost
Borland's results. Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson
Stephens &amp; Co., estimates Borland will earn 26 cents a share
in its first fiscal quarter ending June 30, twice its
year-ago per-share earnings. Mr. Rogers expects Borland's
revenue to total $36 million for the quarter compared with
$23 million in the year-ago period.
   Lotus, however, insists Borland doesn't have staying power
in spreadsheets.
   "I think Quattro Pro is a decent product and they're
making a decent amount of noise," said Frank Ingari, chief of
Lotus's spreadsheet division. "The question long-term is
whether they can sustain the business at a $99 price. It's a
very expensive way to enter the market."
   Mr. Ingari vows to turn up the heat on Borland in the
third quarter of this year with an upgrade to 1-2-3 "that's
going to be a deadly product" for Borland.
   Some analysts are skeptical, arguing that Lotus has spent
too much time trying to "port," or adapt its spreadsheet to
many different types of computers. In the process, Lotus has
failed to add some new features to 1-2-3 that competitors
offer, especially in the area of graphics and better use of a
computer's expensive internal memory.
   Borland's Mr. Kahn insists that Lotus will find it hard to
match some of the novel technical features in Quattro Pro
that make it suitable for less expensive personal computers
that are tied into knots by some more complex versions of
1-2-3. He also said Borland turns a profit on Quattro Pro,
whose cost-of-goods per unit is $10, in part because it sells
most copies directly to customers, bypassing software
distributors.
   While Borland is making gains, it is mainly among
medium-size and small businesses, not the Fortune 1000
concerns that comprise the bulk of Lotus's revenues. "My
sense is that Lotus's corporate accounts are as rock-solid as
ever," said Jeffrey Tartar, editor of Softletter, an industry
newsletter.
