   Remember "Where's the Beef?" -- the jackpot advertising
slogan Wendy's used in the early 1980s? How about "I Want My
Maypo]" -- the line used in ads more than 15 years ago?
   If you thought those ad themes were dead forever, think
again. They're back.

   Wendy's, for one, this summer plans to test a commercial
reviving its mega-hyped ad slogan that found its way onto
T-shirts and even became a gimmick Walter Mondale used in his
1984 presidential bid.
   The late Clara Peller, the fast-food chain's crotchety
pitchlady who barked the line at the counters of rival
hamburger chains, made the slogan famous. But Wendy's says
the line is such a barn-burner that it can be made part of a
hit campaign again without her.
   In dusting off a popular ad theme, Wendy's isn't alone.
Many advertisers are making past themes part of their current
marketing efforts. Perrier, for example, just brought back
its "Earth's First Soft Drink" copy line. And Banfi Vintners
this month starts a campaign reviving a slogan that hasn't
been used for five years: "Riunite on Ice. That's Nice."
   Recycling old ad slogans isn't a new idea. Two years ago,
for example, Nestle Foods brought back its "Nestea Plunge"
ads. But revivals seem to come in waves, and ad executives
say Madison Avenue is in the middle of a big one.
   But marketing experts say recycling old advertising is
very often exactly what a company's marketing plan doesn't
need. Some say bringing back an old campaign is a cop-out
that won't offer the kind of fix that stale brands need.
   "Sometimes this can be smart, because the line represents
the real equity in your brand," says Hank Seiden, chairman of
Ketchum Advertising, New York. But he adds: "It's dumb when
you're just lazy and you go back to a theme that might have
had no significance in the first place. Some people revive
ads just for the sake of reviving it -- maybe the chairman
liked it."
   Mr. Seiden's shop, though, is the one behind the revival
of the old Riunite line, which this month will be used to
court college-age kids. And Ketchum's also responsible for
recently bringing back "I Want My Maypo" to promote the hot
breakfast cereal.
   The difference, Mr. Seiden contends, is that both of those
campaigns were deserted prematurely. Advertising executives
tend to tire of campaigns before the public does, and
advertisers sometimes walk away from strategies when nothing
needs fixing, he says. The Riunite theme "really never
should've been dropped."
   To be sure, some advertisers have been successful
resurrecting ad themes that probably shouldn't have been
abandoned in the first place. Nestle, for example, brought
back the "Nestea Plunge" after struggling with other ad
campaigns for five years. But in deciding to revive the
concept, Nestle found that one-third of surveyed consumers
thought the ads were still on the air.
   In large part, however, marketing experts say, advertisers
stuck with ailing brands are better off moving on to new
approaches rather than holding out for an old campaign to
turn around fortunes.
   "When marketers just don't know what to do next, they seem
to always look backwards when they should be looking
forwards," says Jeffrey B. Hirsch, president of Hirsch
Marketing, a Venice, Calif.-based marketing consultancy.
   Mr. Hirsch and others are especially skeptical about
Wendy's plans to try its hand with the "Where's the Beef?"
slogan again. "It was more Clara's delivery of the line than
the line itself that made the campaign so memorable," Mr.
Hirsch says.
   Wendy's concedes it's not sure what type of response the
test commercial will get. "There's no question that any time
you hit a grand slam home run, you want to aim again," a
spokesman says. "But we own the line and we know that people
associate `Where's the Beef?' with Wendy's."
   The new commercial, which will be tested in a couple of
undisclosed markets, will feature not a Clara Peller
look-alike but Dave Thomas, the firm's founder and senior
chairman. In the new ad, it will be Mr. Thomas, a low-key,
down-home kind of guy, uttering the famous line. "We fully
recognize that you can't fully replace Clara Peller," the
spokesman says. "But this might just work."
   Banfi's decision to revive the "Riunite on Ice" theme has
raised even more questions. Skeptics point to the sliding
sales of the brand -- a victim, though, to a big drop in
overall wine consumption -- and say the brand needs a
complete marketing makeover, not simply a revival of past
efforts that may conjure up some negative imagery among
consumers.
   Mr. Seiden, however, says Riunite encountered problems not
only because it abandoned the slogan but also because it
mistakenly went after an older, more upscale market than the
college-age kids who had always been the centerpiece of the
brand's franchise. "We lost sight of our heritage," he says.
   Some advertising executives say the decision to revive an
ad slogan has to be made case by case. Perrier, for example,
arguably couldn't go forward with its old commercials ("It's
Perfect. It's Perrier.) after traces of the product were
found to be contaminated with benzene. That disaster forced
the company to recall bottles of the mineral water
world-wide.
   So it was fitting to return to the "Earth's First Soft
Drink" theme, insists Joseph LaRosa, chairman of Waring &amp;
LaRosa, which created the first campaign with that slogan in
1981. "The original campaign ran for well over five years,
and it was enormously successful," he says. "The reaction to
the commercials we've just finished has been very positive."

   Ralston Picks Fallon
                                                                                                       

   Fallon McElligott got a big new-business boost Friday,
winning a $25 million pet food assignment from Ralston
Purina.
   Minneapolis-based Fallon will be responsible for creating
what Ralston calls a "line campaign" that will advertise four
of the company's dog food brands simultaneously. The brands
are Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Hi-Pro and Fit &amp; Trim.
   In winning the account, Fallon bested a field that
included Ally &amp; Gargano, Martin Marshall Jaccoma Mitchell,
DDB Needham, Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner and Centra Advertising,
Ralston's in-house agency.
   A spokesman for St. Louis-based Ralston wouldn't say how
the individual ad budgets for the brands will be affected as
a result of the big new-line effort. Currently, Centra
handles the Dog Chow and Puppy Chow accounts. Ally &amp; Gargano
creates ads for Hi-Pro. Fit &amp; Trim has been inactive
recently.
