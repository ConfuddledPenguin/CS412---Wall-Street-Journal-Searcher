   Hedvig Peterson doesn't know much about the stock market.
But Mrs. Peterson, a widow who is 100 years old, remembers
one lesson from the Crash of 1929: Don't buy stocks on
borrowed money.
   So imagine her surprise when, in late 1988, she got a
margin call for $8,000 to bolster her depleted stock account.
Her broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Daniel Hasbrook,
had borrowed tens of thousands of dollars in her $350,000
retirement account, her lawyer says.

   Mrs. Peterson, a retired Tempe, Ariz., grade-school
principal who is legally blind and partially deaf, had signed
a margin agreement that allowed Mr. Hasbrook to trade in her
account with borrowed money. But on the bottom of it, she
scrawled: "I can't read the above fine print. I sign this on
your recommendation."
   She went to arbitration and, in her complaint, accused Mr.
Hasbrook of making unsuitable investments and trading
excessively to drum up commissions. Last September, a
three-member panel of the National Association of Securities
Dealers ruled in her favor. It ordered Shearson to pay her
$250,000 in compensatory damages, plus $1 million in punitive
damages -- the largest punitive award ever granted in an
investor arbitration case.
   Mr. Hasbrook, now a broker at Sears Roebuck's Dean Witter
Reynolds, says: "There are no rules that say she couldn't be
on margin." He adds, "I don't feel I was ever reckless with
the account."
   The securities industry has long pressed arbitration on
its customers. When opening a brokerage account, many
investors sign a standard agreement binding them ahead of
time to accept arbitration, rather than resorting to a
lawsuit, in the event of a dispute with their broker. But now
the tables have turned: As punitive awards to investors
balloon, arbitration is rapidly becoming a financial threat
on Wall Street.
   That's important because investors have been flocking to
arbitration. They filed 6,101 arbitration cases against
brokers and securities firms in 1988. Data for last year
aren't complete, but the 1988 total was up 115% from 1986. By
contrast, the number of securities-related federal lawsuits
dropped 7% during the same period to 2,775, according to the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
   Only a few years ago, securities firms liked the
arbitration process, with good reason. The cases were private
and speedy, and the firms won about half of them. The panels,
which are sanctioned mostly by stock exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations, are typically made up of three
arbitrators, including one securities executive and sometimes
others with ties to Wall Street. They have long been
perceived as stacked against small investors, although this
is vehemently denied by the securities industry.
   More important: Even when securities firms lost, they
typically didn't have to dole out much cash. The awarding of
punitive (or exemplary) damages was relatively rare, and
triple damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law were unheard of. No wonder that the
securities industry cheered when the Supreme Court, in a 1987
case involving Shearson, held that the firms could compel
investors to take disputes to arbitration.
   But Wall Streeters aren't smiling anymore. New rules
imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission allow
pretrial conferences and discovery. Hearings that used to
take two days now often take five or more. And the costs are
rising.
   Other SEC rules promulgated last year have opened the
arbitration process to public scrutiny and thus put pressure
on securities firms to settle disputes to avoid bad
publicity. The firms settled 37% more arbitration cases at
the NASD and 25% more at the New York Stock Exchange last
year than in 1988, even as the number of cases filed at the
two bodies fell slightly.
   But the clearest sign of trouble for Wall Street is a
surge in punitive-damage awards. Punitive damages, which are
generally awarded to punish and deter a defendant found to
have acted recklessly or maliciously, are applied in addition
to actual, or compensatory, damages, which cover the injury
or loss.
   Since May 1989, when figures on arbitration awards were
first made public, arbitration panels have granted 21
punitive-damage awards totaling $4.5 million to investors.
That's up from an estimated nine awards totaling $1.7 million
in the year-earlier period, says the Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.
   Large punitive-damage awards are especially upsetting to
securities firms. Shearson, which notes that the alleged
incident involving Mrs. Peterson began when Mr. Hasbrook
worked at E.F. Hutton (which Shearson acquired in 1988),
says: "We don't believe that the facts in this case support
the size of the award, but we have agreed to abide by the
decision."
   Unlike judges or juries, arbitrators don't have to spell
out why they impose punitive awards, and thus they give the
firms little guidance about exactly what they did wrong. And
winning court appeals in arbitration cases is difficult
because federal arbitration law provides only a narrow window
for reversing decisions.
   "The scariest thing as a litigator trying a {big}
arbitration case," says George Schieren, assistant general
counsel at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., "is if you lose, there's no
appellate cushion -- you write the check."
   Securities executives still defend arbitration. Despite
longer cases and the punitive awards, arbitration remains
cheaper and quicker than going to court. Moreover, lawyers at
major brokerage firms say punitive awards are still unusual.
One reason: If lawyers believe that the firm has a poor case,
they try to settle it.
   But big awards are alarming the securities industry. It is
"wondering a lot" about its commitment to arbitration, says
Sam Scott Miller, a former general counsel at PaineWebber
Group Inc. who now works for a New York law firm.
   Says Theodore Krebsbach, Shearson's head of litigation,
who successfully tried the landmark Supreme Court case: "If
the trend continues, at some point you have to say: `What are
we trying to accomplish here?' The purpose of arbitration
isn't to give out windfalls but to make investors whole."
   Attorneys at big firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch
say they no longer automatically steer their firms to
arbitration rather than letting the customer sue them in
court. They look at complaints on a case-by-case basis,
weighing the facts and jurisdiction of the dispute.
(Customers have always had the option of forcing a dispute
into arbitration; the 1987 Supreme Court decision essentially
gave the firms the same flexibility.)
   Now, in addition to the increase in punitive damages,
securities firms face the threat of triple-damage awards by
arbitrators under the controversial RICO law, originally
aimed at organized crime. In January, an arbitration panel,
ruling against Shearson, awarded an Oklahoma wheat farmer and
his wife $406,000, split evenly between compensatory and
punitive damages -- plus more than $600,000 in triple damages
under RICO. It was the first time an investor arbitration
panel awarded RICO damages.
   In the case, filed in August 1988, Walter Earl Cox, 61,
and his wife, Ardenia, 60, accused their Shearson broker of
unauthorized trading and said their retirement account was
unsuitable for speculative trading in stock options. In an
interview, Mrs. Cox recalls a 1985 meeting with the broker,
Lindy Kent Ridinger, at the couple's farmhouse. She says he
urged them to sell municipal bonds they held and buy options;
he later bought 4,600 "naked" OEX put options for the account
in seven months.
   An option gives the holder the right but not the
obligation to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a stock or other
investment at a specified price within a stipulated period.
OEX put options are bets that the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock
index will fall; a naked option is especially risky because
the investor doesn't own the underlying stocks.
   The Coxes eventually lost about half their $400,000
account when a rising stock market hammered their options
positions, according to papers the Coxes filed with the
arbitrators.
   Shearson disagreed with the size of the award, a spokesman
says, but is abiding by the decision. Mr. Ridinger pleaded
guilty to a federal wire-fraud charge and served four months
in jail. Reached in Dallas, where he now sells real estate,
the 31-year-old Mr. Ridinger says he misjudged the risks of
options.
   "Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing," he says
now. "I never should have messed with them."
   The excessive use of options has triggered several other
big punitive awards. Among them is the case of Leonard Meyer,
a 65-year-old Atlantan. The former wholesale liquor
distributor says he never was a gambler and never believed in
borrowing, not even to buy a car. But he says in an interview
that his PaineWebber broker, Andrew Cinman, kept calling him
with a pitch for a computerized options-trading program. Mr.
Meyer says Mr. Cinman contended that the program minimized
trading risk. "It's a shame you're not taking advantage of
it," Mr. Meyer quotes Mr. Cinman as saying.
   Mr. Meyer says he was wary but agreed when Mr. Cinman
assured him that the options wouldn't expose the account to
losses exceeding $20,000. Between late 1986 and October 1987,
Mr. Cinman made more than 150 option trades, according to
papers Mr. Meyer filed with arbitrators. Then, in the October
1987 stock-market plunge, Mr. Meyer lost nearly $600,000.
   Robert Berson, PaineWebber's general counsel, declines to
comment. Mr. Cinman, who has left PaineWebber, couldn't be
reached. But Mr. Meyer taped a conversation with the broker
just days after the crash. According to a transcript of the
tape submitted to arbitrators, the broker said: "Was I
monitoring the account for a $20,000 loss? Yes. Did it happen
way outside my control? Yes. Was I responsible for that? Do I
feel responsible? Obviously, yeah, I'm responsible." A
PaineWebber executive confirms the authenticity of the tape
but complains that the taping was done without the broker's
knowledge.
   In March 1989, an NASD arbitration panel awarded Mr. Meyer
$745,000, including $500,000 in punitive damages. After
PaineWebber filed a court motion to vacate the award, the
case was settled for about $600,000, according to people
familiar with the matter.
   Of course, just the fact that a broker traded options and
lost a client's money isn't grounds for an arbitration award,
let alone punitive damages. Here are some of the kinds of
cases in which investors stand the best chance in
arbitration, according to David Robbins, a former arbitration
director at the American Stock Exchange and author of a
booklet for investors called "Securities Arbitration Guide":
   Unsuitability: When a broker knew or should have known
that an investment was inappropriate or inconsistent with the
customer's investment objectives.
   Churning: When, to obtain commissions, a broker traded
excessively in a customer's account, in light of its
character, over which the broker had control.
   Unauthorized Trading: When trades were made without the
customer's approval.
   Margin Accounts and Overleveraging: When the broker didn't
explain to the customer, or the customer didn't understand,
that his or her stocks put up as collateral could be
liquidated to meet margin calls. Even if the customer signed
a margin agreement, he or she may not have understood what
the "small print" meant.
   Unlike juries, which are instructed by judges about when,
where and how they can award punitive damages, arbitrators
essentially have free reign. But many arbitrators long
assumed that the law didn't allow them to impose punitive
damages, says Richard Ryder, editor of the Securities
Arbitration Commentator and a former director of arbitration
at the NASD.
   Some securities executives still contend that punitive
damage awards are allowed in arbitration cases only where
state law permits them. But a series of federal-court rulings
in recent years found that arbitrators do have the right to
award punitive damages under the Federal Arbitration Act,
arbitration specialists say.
   Nevertheless, some big financial-services firms still are
trying to fight punitive awards. Dreyfus Corp., the
mutual-fund group, says it is contesting a $50,000
punitive-damage award handed down by an American Arbitration
Association panel. Roman Kent, a New York businessman who
argued the case himself, won the punitive damages against
Dreyfus in March, along with $16,000 in compensatory damages,
after he accused the company of, among other things,
directing him into an unsuitable bond mutual fund.
   "It's a preposterous claim," a Dreyfus spokesman says,
adding that the firm considers the punitive award "totally,
totally out of order." The arbitrators, Dreyfus adds, "have
no authority to do it."
   Of the nation's 10 arbitration forums, the American
Arbitration Association is widely viewed as the most
sympathetic to investors. Unlike exchanges or self-regulatory
bodies such as the NASD, which are subsidized by the
securities industry, the AAA is privately funded. But most
investors are required by their brokerage agreements to take
disputes to the Big Board or NASD forums, which handle 92% of
all arbitration cases. Investors win about half the time in
such forums, and about 60% before the AAA, Mr. Ryder says.
   When investors win punitive damages, the money sometimes
comes straight out of the broker's pocket. When Jana Fong
received $300,000 from the sale of her family's furniture
business in 1986, she called on Michael Goldberg, a friend
and PaineWebber broker, to help her invest it. She gave him a
free hand to trade her account, she says in an interview and
in papers filed with arbitrators. In the next year, he
launched an aggressive naked-option program in the account
and made more than 800 trades.
   Mr. Goldberg, Ms. Fong says, repeatedly assured her that
the account was making money and that he wouldn't risk more
than 20% of it. After the market crashed, however, she was
left with only $11,306, her arbitration filings say.
   Last July, a five-member arbitration panel of the Pacific
Stock Exchange ruled that "the type of stock-options activity
was unsuitable . . . due to the extremely high risk factor."
It added that "there was a substantial failure" by
PaineWebber to supervise Mr. Goldberg. The panel awarded Ms.
Fong $403,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in
punitive damages -- $100,000 to be paid by the firm and
$50,000 by Mr. Goldberg.
   "He betrayed me," Ms. Fong says.
   "I felt worse than she did," says Mr. Goldberg, now a
broker at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. PaineWebber declines to
comment.
