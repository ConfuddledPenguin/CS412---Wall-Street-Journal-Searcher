   NEW YORK -- Two former brokers, one with Charles Schwab &amp;
Co. and the other with a joint venture of Investors Co. and
Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, agreed to be barred by the American
Stock Exchange without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.
   The exchange charged brothers Vincent and Michael O'Rourke
here with creating false transactions in customer accounts.
The O'Rourkes couldn't be reached for comment.
