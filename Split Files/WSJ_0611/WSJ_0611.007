   WASHINGTON -- Listening earnestly to questions about
several notoriously disorganized Justice Department
subdivisions, William Barr, the agency's new No. 2 man, nods,
sighs, and then breaks into a wide grin. "This is a big job]"
he declares.
   The post of deputy attorney general, traditionally the
day-to-day operations chief of the 75,000-person department,
now includes an additional task that is even more daunting.
He must help repair the damaged political reputation of his
boss, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the most beleaguered
member of the Bush cabinet.

   Mr. Barr, an affable Reaganite conservative with strong
ties to the Bush White House as well, has taken some sensible
preliminary steps. For starters, he reveals a sense of humor
and humility about a department that bucked and stalled while
a coterie of longtime Thornburgh vassals were at the wheel.
   "His personal staff was playing, by default, too much of
an operating role," acknowledges Mr. Barr, whose promotion
from assistant attorney general is expected to receive quick
Senate confirmation. Already moved into the deputy's spacious
fourth-floor office suite, the somewhat rumpled lawyer in
horn-rimmed glasses explains that he has taken the unusual
step of drafting three veteran U.S. attorneys as special
assistants. They will help him pick his way through a
bureaucratic briar patch that he admits he doesn't know much
about yet. The message to disgruntled department employees is
clear: We're going back to the drawing board, with respected
prosecutors from the field on the way to whip things into
shape.
   Mr. Barr, a former Central Intelligence Agency legislative
aide zealous about protecting executive branch prerogatives,
nevertheless promises "a more open department," with greater
access afforded to inquisitive lawmakers and reporters. He
won't comment on the matter directly, but he is said to
believe that the attorney general made a mistake by turning a
no-leaks policy into a holy crusade.
   Investigators collared no culprits, but Mr. Thornburgh
raised suspicions by locking out the department's
internal-affairs office. To make matters worse, the attorney
general kept quiet when two aides, since pushed aside,
registered some deception during lie-detector tests.
   Despite Mr. Barr's promises of reform, there are reasons
to be skeptical that he will bring lasting changes. Here are
three areas to watch:
                                                                                                       

   Public image. Mr. Thornburgh has been badly tarnished by
his bedraggled inquiry into a leak about a federal
investigation involving Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.). After
exonerating Mr. Gray a year ago, the attorney general now
refuses to reiterate that the No. 3 House Democrat isn't the
target of a grand jury inquiry in Philadelphia. That
obfuscation, combined with the issuance of subpoenas to
organizations that have paid Mr. Gray speaking fees, creates
the impression, once again, of partisan gamesmanship.
   Mr. Barr could help clear the air by urging the attorney
general to acknowledge that this is an exceptional case and
to state what, if anything, federal investigators still want
to know about Mr. Gray. But there is little reason to hope
this will happen. Asked about the Gray situation, Mr. Barr
says, "I don't know anything about any investigation, nor do
I want to." He declines to comment further.
                                                                                                       

   Congressional relations. After successfully helping
negotiate anti-drug legislation in late 1988, the Thornburgh
regime has taken an adversarial stance toward Congress,
compared by Democratic Capitol Hill staff members to that of
Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese. Lately,
there have been positive developments, such as Mr.
Thornburgh's agreement to cooperate with a House Judiciary
Committee investigation of a longfestering computer software
procurement scandal at the department.
   But one way Mr. Barr impressed the attorney general,
according to some observers, was by refusing to cooperate
with congressional efforts to look into legal opinions that
expanded the authority of U.S. agents and troops to do police
work abroad. Moreover, in most cases the department hasn't
played a significant role in shaping legislation viewed as
important by the White House. The department isn't deeply
involved, for example, in the negotiations over the big
anti-crime bill under debate in the Senate.
                                                                                                       

   Running trains on time. Dick Thornburgh enjoys being
called governor. He cites his eight years as chief executive
of Pennsylvania as a case study of frugal, commonsense
management.
   At the Justice Department, he has identified waste and
inefficiency in a number of areas, including the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and the Marshals Service. New
directors are in place, and some bureaucratic flow charts
have been rearranged. But substantive change has been slow,
if evident at all. Drug enforcement officials, for example,
worry that regional marshals who act as custodians of
forfeited assets frequently allow them to depreciate because
of a lack of financial acumen.
   Meanwhile, other problems continue unchecked. In the
department's money-granting and research arm, the Office of
Justice Programs, career employees say that federal money
intended to fertilize innovative state and local programs is
being channeled elsewhere. A House Government Operations
subcommittee investigation disclosed that almost half of one
$50 million grant program for states and cities actually
stayed in Washington, most of it at the Justice Department.
   Mr. Barr says his mission will be "coordinating the
department's efforts {which have been} lacking in a number of
areas." As to specifics, he understandably pleads ignorance,
having just unpacked his boxes and hung his photographs. But
if Mr. Thornburgh is to resuscitate his reputation as a savvy
manager, it will be Mr. Barr who wades into more than a few
messes and begins the cleanup.
