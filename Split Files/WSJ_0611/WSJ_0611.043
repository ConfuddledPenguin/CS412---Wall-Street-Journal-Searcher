   In just four years, Garry Shandling has come a long way
for a guy who misspells his first name. Toiling in the
relatively obscure world of cable, Mr. Shandling has offered
his smallish audiences a quirky brand of humor, marked by one
of the deadest deadpans around.
   This week, Mr. Shandling drives off into the sunset in the
last installment of "It's the Garry Shandling Show"
(Showtime, Thursday, 10:35 p.m. EDT). This final episode,
entitled "Driving Miss Garry," spoofs the Academy-Award
winning film, and features Dan Aykroyd and Paul Winfield.

   "Driving Miss Garry" epitomizes everything that has made
Mr. Shandling's series so innovative and so impossible to
watch -- the highlights, the lowlights, the taillights.
   As the show opens, Miss Garry has just crashed his golf
cart. "Last week, when Garry took his driving test, he
knocked down three cones," we're told.
   "Three cones? Big deal]" says a neighbor.
   "The Cohens are a nice Jewish family," interjects another.
   Dan Aykroyd shows up, reprising his Southern gent, Boolie.
"You may be a remarkably spry and independent man of 40 . . .
" he says to Garry.
   "I have my own teeth, I will say that," Garry cuts in.
   "It still doesn't mean you can drive a car."
   Enter Paul Winfield as Hoke the chauffeur. Hoke drives
Garry. Hoke offers Garry advice: "I wouldn't go on
`Letterman.' That man is as crotchety as a crocodile." Garry
teaches Hoke to read: "I've taught millions of kids to read
through my opening credits. . . . Let's sound it out. Corky,
right? Kuh, kuh, kuh -- what letter does that sound like?"
   "Well, it sounds like a K]"
   "Well it's a C. Okay, let's go to the last letter: Corky,
eee, eee, eeeee."
   "It's got to be E]"
   "No, it's a Y."
   And in the end, the two men develop a beautiful and
meaningful relationship. "Your mind took a wrong turn, and
dropped you off at the corner," says Hoke.
   The thing about Garry Shandling is, he's never too funny.
His parodies never venture too far afield into hilarity, they
just sort of putter along. (One typical parody: "I heard him
exclaim, as he rode through the air, Merry Christmas to all,
and to all `How's my hair?'")
   In fact, you'd have to call Mr. Shandling a breakthrough
comedian, a comedian who dares not to be funny. He's a master
of the awkward silence and the embarrassed chuckle. Starting
as a writer for "Sanford and Son" and "Welcome Back Kotter,"
Mr. Shandling got into standup performance at about the same
time David Letterman was coming up, and they share a twisted,
deadpan sensibility. Mr. Shandling often plays in Mr.
Letterman's mode of not-funny humor, although Mr. Shandling
can be much more not-funny. "You rode over the bushes,"
accuses Boolie. "The president and his family? That's
terrible," says Garry. Mr. Winfield delivers an apt review:
"Garry lets fly a real corker every month or two."
   What makes "It's the Garry Shandling Show" so interesting
is its bumbling, self-conscious approach. In most TV
humor-sitcoms, skitcoms, or whatever -- the famous "fourth
wall" is squarely in place; that is, the audience watches a
funny story happening "out there." But with Mr. Shandling's
show, the audience is drawn into the action as another
character, when Mr. Shandling steps in and out of his role to
chat about the events. In this self-aware style, the comedian
will speak a line in character, then comment to the audience
on the size of the laugh he just got.
   "Driving Miss Garry" offers a prime example. Dusting the
house, Hoke finds a large plastic mold in the shape of
buttocks. He pulls it out and frowns at Garry: "You're a very
funny man. No need to resort to a big fake butt to get
laughs."
   "Have you ever had your own cable comedy series?" shoots
back Garry.
   "Well, no sir."
   "I didn't think so. Have you ever made 500 people laugh
just by putting on a big fake butt? I didn't think so. Check
this out."
   He straps it on and cavorts around for a while. The studio
audience howls. Hoke shakes his head.
   "I'm not saying it's not funny. I'm just saying it's not
the right kind of laugh. I bet right now your audience is
pretty ashamed of itself."
   This is the involuted, self-referential way "It's the
Garry Shandling Show" gets its laughs. But for all that, the
series has expanded the boundaries of the small screen. Mr.
Shandling has invented a new middle ground for comedy between
standup, which acknowledges and even plays off the audience,
and the sitcom, which doesn't. He has influenced a group of
younger comedians who are following him on the tube, from
Jerry Seinfeld to Dave Thomas.
   As for the final scorecard: "It's the Garry Shandling
Show" misfired as often as it hit, but that's exactly what a
cable series should be doing. It was, in its own quiet,
fumbling way, a bold experiment. Sure it fell flat on its
face a lot, sure it wasn't funny a lot, but at least there
was some real imagination to it. Which is a pretty rare
commodity these days. (Just look at CBS's recent agreement
with the BBC. The bottom-ranked network is so short of ideas
that, in desperation, it's paying a fee to import them from
overseas.)
   In the end, whatever else you say about Garry Shandling,
you have to admit that he's one of the most talented
vegetarians around. I'll miss him, even though I rarely
watched his show.
