   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers said it would be "irresponsible" for the Federal
Reserve not to reduce interest rates if Congress and the Bush
administration settle on a budget that substantially cuts the
federal deficit.
   "The Federal Reserve could offset any such fiscal
contraction" resulting from a deficit accord, said Michael
Boskin, the top economic adviser to President Bush. "It
should, and it would be irresponsible if it didn't."

   Mr. Boskin said, however, there was "no formal deal"
between the Bush administration and the Fed to lower rates.
"If there's a serious, credible, multiyear budget deal
accomplished, that should take a lot of pressure off of
long-term interest rates, and it should give {the Fed} the
elbowroom to lower interest rates," Mr. Boskin said yesterday
on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
   Fed officials have indicated in recent days that they are
happy with the current "moderately restrictive" monetary
policy, as Fed Gov. Edward Kelley described it. Though some
indicators, such as slow employment growth, have pointed to a
stalling economy, Fed officials are concerned about a
continuing threat of inflation and see no signs of weakness
in some other statistics such as the level of inventories.
