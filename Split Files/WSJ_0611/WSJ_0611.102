   A federal judge in San Francisco denied a request by
Nintendo of America Inc. for a temporary restraining order
that would have kept Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. from selling a
video-game device.
   Nintendo sought to stop Galoob from distributing its "Game
Genie," a gadget that makes Nintendo games easier to play.
Nintendo of America, a unit of Japan's Nintendo Co., filed a
lawsuit against the South San Francisco company June 1,
alleging that the Game Genie lets consumers infringe on
Nintendo copyrights by altering Nintendo games.

   In addition to filing for the temporary restraining order,
Nintendo had sought an injunction. While denying the request
for the restraining order, the judge scheduled a formal
hearing for June 29 on Nintendo's request for a preliminary
injunction.
   "We believe very strongly that we don't infringe on
anyone's rights," said Steven Klein, Galoob executive vice
president.
   Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo general counsel said the company
achieved its objectives. "We went to court to get a hearing
date . . . and we got it."
