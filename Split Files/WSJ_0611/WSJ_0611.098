   MGM/UA Communications Co. said in Culver City, Calif.,
that it received the fourth and final $50 million down
payment from Pathe Communications Corp. toward Pathe's $1.2
billion tender offer for the movie studio.
   Pathe has now put down a security deposit of $200 million
in cash. Time Warner Inc. has agreed to provide a $650
million loan as part of the purchase price, and is in
discussions with Pathe and its chairman, Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti, about Pathe's ability to come up with the
rest of the financing.

   The tender offer is scheduled to expire Friday, but can be
extended until June 23, and if all parties are agreeable,
even further.
