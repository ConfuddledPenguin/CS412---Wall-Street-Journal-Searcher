   When we think of coercion, we usually think of government
as the culprit. Sometimes the government can be the solution,
as when the Supreme Court justices last week repeated their
admonition that groups with mandatory membership may not
force members to fund political activities they oppose.
   This time the offenders were, ironically, lawyers. The
defendant was the state bar of California, which all lawyers
in the state must join and fund through dues. Dissident
lawyers brought Keller v. State Bar of California because
they objected to politicking by the state bar funded with
their compulsory dues. The California bar has actively
supported gun control, nuclear-freeze ballot initiatives and
an unlimited right to sue anyone who causes air pollution.
This kind of ideological lobbying has nothing to do with the
purpose of the bar, the "regulation of the profession and
improvement to the administration of justice."

   A unanimous Supreme Court cited Thomas Jefferson. "To
compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
propagation of opinions which he disbelieves," barrister
Jefferson wrote, "is sinful and tyrannical." It also violates
the First Amendment free-speech rights of dissenting members.
The court did uphold the practice in some 30 states of
requiring fee-paying bar membership by all lawyers. This
looks like a closed-shop union, but the justices couldn't
quite bring themselves to view fellow lawyers as mere guild
members.
   So lawyers can continue to be required to belong to state
bars and pay dues, but at least none of their dues can go for
pushing ideological goals they oppose. This could also quash
proposals in several states to have mandatory "pro bono"
(free service) requirements, which could be met by financial
contributions to special-interest and typically left-wing
litigation groups.
   While this is good news for lawyers, other workers keep
getting misinformation from the National Labor Relations
Board. We wrote last year that the NLRB was not informing
workers of their rights under the 1988 Supreme Court decision
Beck v. Communications Workers of America. This case said
that workers don't have to become full financial members of a
union, and workers are obliged to pay union dues covering
only collective bargaining. Workers do not have to pay for a
union's political activities or any other non-bargaining
activities.
   The National Right to Work Committee last year discovered
that NLRB literature made no mention of the workers' new
rights granted by Beck, and that NLRB officials tended to
describe incorrectly what union activities workers were
compelled to pay for and which they were not.
   The NLRB hasn't cleaned up its act. Steve Kerekes of the
NRWC cites NLRB literature that states the so-called
financial core members who "object" to the "use of their
payments for non-representational purposes" might be
compelled to pay for the "union's costs of representational
activities (such as collective bargaining, contract
administration, and grievance adjustment)." Although the NLRB
defends this language, it's at the least misleading.
   Beck doesn't even allow the collection of dues for
non-bargaining purposes. Further, the "such as" before the
list of union activities workers must fund seems to leave the
door open for union activities, such as politics, that are
prohibited.
   Whether or not NLRB bureaucrats agree with Beck, it's the
law. Even lawyers sometimes have to sue to ensure their
rights against their bar groups. It's time the NLRB at least
made sure that workers know what their rights are.
