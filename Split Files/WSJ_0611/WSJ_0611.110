   WASHINGTON -- The nature of the deal the West plans to
give Moscow to cover its retreat from Eastern Europe is
finally becoming clear. But whether it will satisfy Mikhail
Gorbachev isn't certain.
   During a summit meeting that featured confrontation over
Europe's future, and again in meetings in Denmark and
Scotland, the West made a strong sales pitch, offering the
Soviet president a tradeoff during the next six months.

   The West's terms are stark. The Soviets have lost Eastern
Europe and their foothold in Germany, so they must agree to
an arms treaty sealing the Red Army's retreat from Eastern
Europe and destroying thousands of its weapons. They will
have to swallow the absorption of East Germany by West
Germany, and the full membership of the resulting united
Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They will
also have to set a timetable for pulling 380,000 troops out
of former East Germany.
   In return, the West is promising three things. First, it
will help ease Soviet fears by agreeing to shrink German
armed forces over time, to keep Germany from building nuclear
or chemical weapons, and to stress NATO's political role,
rather than its military arms.
   Second, it will help bankroll Soviet demilitarization and
economic reform, through potentially huge economic aid from
Germany.
   Finally, it will help Mr. Gorbachev feel involved and
wanted in Europe by finding some permanent conference table
on European matters at which he can have a seat -- probably a
more formal version of the 35-nation floating Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   "The states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union all want to feel that they are part of a European
structure, part of a European architecture," says Secretary
of State James Baker.
   Another senior U.S. official who traveled with Mr. Baker
to last week's NATO meeting in Europe says the U.S. wants to
ensure "that the Soviet Union should be part of the process
of managing change," rather than a sullen -- and dangerous --
spectator.
   But Mikhail Gorbachev knows that except for the German
economic aid, the West's package is largely cosmetic. Strip
away the niceties, and George Bush's vision of the future of
Europe still rests on two alliances from which the U.S.S.R.
is excluded: NATO, whose mutual defense system would remain;
and the European Community, which is moving toward an
integrated market and a close new relationship with the U.S.
   Mr. Gorbachev will be working hard for a better bargain
before December's CSCE summit meeting, at which all this is
supposed to be wrapped up.
   We are likely to hear more of the warning he says he
delivered to Mr. Bush at the summit: "If we in the Soviet
Union feel that we are being squeezed out, that . . .
pressure is being applied on us for a unilateral advantage of
the other side, well . . . that is something that does more
than just . . . cause concern."
   Already, the West's offer has grown beyond the "nine
points" offered by Mr. Bush at the summit. Mr. Baker, an
expert at compromise, has seized upon a vague Soviet idea for
direct NATO-Warsaw Pact talks, making it in effect a 10th
piece of the fig-leaf package.
   "Jim Baker won't care if there are 15 things on the list,
as long as they just provide cover for Gorbachev," says an
administration official. One added item being discussed is
whether to let Soviet and East European officials attend
certain NATO political meetings as observers. Another
possibility involves using German construction companies to
build new housing inside the U.S.S.R. for returning Soviet
troops.
   As the bargaining goes on, there are two main dangers for
U.S. interests. One is that German officials will be so eager
for a deal they will press Mr. Bush to weaken NATO too much,
going beyond a shift in emphasis to gut its military core.
Various German politicians are already talking about getting
all foreign troops out.
   A second danger stems from uncertainty in Moscow. It isn't
clear whether Mr. Gorbachev will retain full authority over
Soviet foreign policy in his struggle for power with the
republics led by Russia's Boris Yeltsin. Even if he does,
some Soviet officials say there is a fierce internal debate
among his foreign policy advisers about how easily to settle
with the West -- and especially whether to cut a broad deal
with a West led by the U.S., or a narrow one with Germany
alone. The latter approach might cost Moscow less, but it
would cause Washington more pain.
