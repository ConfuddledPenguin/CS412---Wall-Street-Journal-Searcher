   Tokyo stock prices sagged Friday, even after some
institutional buying interest, pressured down by light
profit-taking and limited arbitrage selling, traders said.
   In London, shares ended slightly off their intraday lows
in moderately active trading, despite a spate of takeover
rumors and selective institutional buying and
position-squaring on the last day of the current trading
account.

   In Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 issues, which had gained
239 points Thursday, fell 199.21 to close at 32993.29. Though
volume was moderate, traders said the majority of
transactions were connected to the special settlement
price-setting for June options and futures contracts, which
expired Thursday. First section volume was estimated at 700
million shares, up modestly from 660.5 million shares a day
earlier. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which rose 5.37 points on Thursday, fell
16.66 to 2411.78.
   At mid-morning Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index had dropped
293.98 points to 32699.31.
   Participants attempted in the morning session Friday to
drive up prices, as opening prices on the Nikkei 225 index
were used in determining the settlement price for the June
contracts. Settlement price-linked buying was absorbed by
some profit-taking, as the Nikkei 225 index ended the morning
session flat, observers said.
   Because of the consolidation, the fact that some
institutional investors were buying selectively during the
morning was masked, according to the chief trader at a top
British securities firm. The trader said he viewed the buying
as an optimistic sign, pointing out, moreover, that the
Nikkei index's afternoon close Friday below 33000 "is a
reason to be positive" about this week.
   The trader cited a growing variety of views on the
market's future, ranging from upward to sideways, and
indicated the likelihood of a greater focusing on earnings
results and strong company predictions during the next couple
of weeks. Another trader predicted a firmer equity market for
at least one more month, partly because of the steadier
yen-dollar rate.
   Despite this market optimism, stock prices' decline Friday
owed to softness in domestic issues, traders said.
   Daiwa Securities fell 50 yen at 1,590 yen ($10.42). Nomura
Securities slipped 10 to 2,420, Nikko Securities declined 40
to 1,330, and Yamaichi Securities lost 20 to 1,350.
   Nonlife insurance stocks also declined.
   Tokio Marine &amp; Fire fell 20 to 1,490, Taisho Marine &amp; Fire
lost 10 to 1,150, Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire slipped 10 to 1,140,
and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine fell 40 to 1,150.
   Nisshin Steel fell 14 to 960, Nippon Steel fell 12 to 608,
NKK was down 16 at 680, and Kawasaki Steel dropped 8 to 612.
   Some consumption-linked stocks, such as retail stores,
were stronger amid the coming Japanese bonus season,
observers said. Tokyu Department Store rose 60 to 1,930, and
Maruzen gained 10 to 1,440.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index ended down 11.8 points at 2366.6, after hitting a low
in retreating 14.5. The intraday high was reached shortly
after trading began, when the index was up 4.6 points. Volume
was 444.2 million shares, compared with 592.5 shares a day
earlier. The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 11.3
points at 1892.7.
   Traders said the market had a healthy consolidation last
week, and is positioned well to try further climbs. Traders
were expecting both Wall Street and London to firm this week,
as "people are buying on the dips rather than selling on the
rallies," one of them said. Also, institutional investors are
said to be flush with cash and looking to buy selectively in
the market.
   The banking and insurance sectors were rife with rumors,
including one suggesting that the merchant bank Midland
Montagu would merge with the securities firm James Capel. But
a James Capel official said late Friday afternoon there
wasn't any substance to the talk.
   The market's anticipation of a joint venture between
Midland and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, which holds slightly
less than 15% of Midland, was viewed as a potentially
attractive arrangement. But a general downgrading of profit
and dividend forecasts for the banking sector mostly
pressured the other issues lower. Lloyds, for example, lost
10% since midweek; it closed Friday down 6 pence at 285.
National Westminster eased 9 pence to 345.
   Rumors that Prudential Insurance Co. of America was
planning a move on Prudential Corp. failed to boost its share
price; it ended down 3 pence at 226.
   The Royal Bank of Scotland Direct Line insurance
subsidiary's advertising campaign for discounted
house-contents insurance, which seemed to generate
considerable consumer interest, caused Sun Alliance to
retreat 2 pence to 323, as it has about 15% of the house
insurance market.
   Bass recovered earlier losses, gaining 5 pence to #10.65
($18).
   Imperial Chemical Industries lost 9 pence to #12.16, on a
sterling-related decline. British Aerospace lost 7 pence to
540, on a general downgrading of the defense sector amid
Warsaw Pact changes.
   Fisons shed 10 pence to 374. Its first hearing before the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's pharmaceutical committee,
seeking approval for its asthma drug, is scheduled for today.
But the market widely expects it to obtain approval, and this
has been factored into the price.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed lower in Frankfurt, Paris
and Madrid, and were mixed in Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan. South African gold stocks closed lower.
Frankfurt trading was thin, as worries about the monetary
union with East Germany and position-squaring before the
weekend weighed on prices.
   In Asia, share prices closed higher in Hong Kong,
Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Wellington and Seoul, and
lower in Taipei and Sydney. Hong Kong stocks jumped 1% in
heavy trading, as early weakness was overwhelmed by brisk
buying in properties shares, stoked by rumors of a local
interest rate cut. In Taipei, prices extended their losses
for the fifth consecutive session, and analysts said many
investors stayed on the sidelines, fearing the market would
decline further.
