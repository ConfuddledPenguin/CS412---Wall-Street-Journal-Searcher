   NEW YORK -- Small investors could soon have more elbow
room in bringing arbitration cases against their brokers.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is quietly prodding
Wall Street to give investors the option of bringing disputes
with brokers to independent arbitration forums -- rather than
just to arbitration panels sponsored by the exchanges
themselves.

   In a letter to top Wall Street executives, the SEC is
urging the securities industry to adopt a rule giving
investors the choice of resolving their arbitration disputes
at "a reputable forum that is unrelated to the industry."
   The issue goes to the heart of a hot topic in securities
arbitration. The SEC says that giving customers such
flexibility would allay concerns that arbitration stacks the
deck against small investors. Securities executives have long
denied that the industry's arbitration panels are unfair.
   "Customers won't feel they're being tied to an
industry-sponsored forum," says Richard Ryder, editor of the
Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.
   Investors typically sign a standard agreement when they
open a brokerage account that binds them to accept
arbitration in case of a dispute, rather than filing a
lawsuit.
   And many customers are required by the agreements to take
their cases to industry-subsidized forums. Most go to
arbitration panels sponsored by the National Association of
Securities Dealers or the New York Stock Exchange.
   The major independent forum, the American Arbitration
Association, is privately funded and widely perceived to be
the most sympathetic to investors. (Investors win about 60%
of the time at the AAA, compared with about 50% at
exchange-sponsored forums, arbitration specialists say.)
   The trouble is, the AAA is more expensive. And that,
coupled with brokers' perception that they don't fare as well
at the AAA, is why most securities firms oppose giving
investors the freedom to take disputes there. Moreover, AAA
arbitrators often have less securities experience than those
at exchange-sponsored forums, Wall Streeters argue, thus
lengthening cases. AAA arbitrators, not surprisingly, dismiss
those concerns.
   The controversy has sparked litigation. Last month, the
influential U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
effectively closed the so-called Amex Window, which affected
investors with brokerage agreements involving the American
Stock Exchange. This "window" allowed investors to go to the
American Arbitration Association if their brokerage contract
didn't bind them specifically to the Amex's own arbitration
panel.
   To keep the window shut, the Amex has asked for SEC
approval to amend its constitution by allowing investors to
go to the AAA only if their contract doesn't specify any
exchange-sponsored forum.
   The recent SEC letter comes as securities firms study a
broader plan to establish a single arbitration forum to
resolve customer complaints. But the commission meantime
wants the industry to address the "significant imbalance" in
the arbitration caseload, according to the letter, which was
signed by the SEC's director of market regulation, Richard G.
Ketchum, and dated May 10. Steering cases to independent
arbitration forums would help the caseload imbalance.
   NASD and Big Board panels together handle 92% of all
arbitration cases, and often hear disputes involving trades
that occurred on other exchanges. For example, 30% of a
recent list of arbitration cases published by the Securities
Arbitration Commentator involved options -- even though these
products aren't widely traded on either the Big Board or
over-the-counter market, which is regulated by the NASD.
   The SEC wants securities executives to respond to the
letter by July 1; even if the industry were to give investors
the flexibility to go to the AAA, any new rule would be at
least many months away.
   This isn't the first time the SEC has tried to push Wall
Street to be more flexible. In 1987, the commission
recommended that brokerage firms include the AAA as an
available arbitration forum in their brokerage agreements.
But the SEC never before had asked for a uniform rule.
   But most firms still balk. One exception is A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc., which gives investors the choice of using the AAA
because it says it finds no substantial difference among
arbitration panels.
   "We're not afraid of arbitration," says David Mesker, a
senior vice president at A.G. Edwards. "The only thing we
want is someone on the panel who is familiar with the
business."
