   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The chairman of USAir Group Inc. said
the nation's seventh-largest airline will postpone delivery
of a dozen new aircraft for more than three years because of
sluggish business.
   Edwin I. Colodny, chairman, said the airline would delay
delivery of the Boeing Co. planes from 1991-92 to 1995.

   USAir spokesman John Bronson confirmed the statement and
said the planes involved are all Boeing 737s.
   Mr. Bronson said the proposal to defer delivery until 1995
was included in Mr. Colodny's recent letter to all USAir
employees.
   In exchange for delaying the deliveries, USAir agreed to
buy 24 more planes from the manufacturer and purchase options
on 56 more aircraft after 1995, Mr. Colodny said.
   USAir has one of the airline industry's younger fleets and
will delay retiring some planes, Mr. Colodny said.
   USAir had a loss of $76 million in 1989 after 13
consecutive profitable years; it posted a $38 million loss
for 1990's first quarter.
   In last year's annual report, the company said it had
commitments to buy five Boeing 767s before 1992 and 55 Boeing
737s before 1993.
   Projected spending on new planes was $882 million this
year, $767 million in 1991 and $264 million in 1992, the
report said.
