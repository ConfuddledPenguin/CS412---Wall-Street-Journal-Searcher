   Ames Department Stores Inc., in a major retreat from its
ill-fated expansion plans, said it plans to close nearly
one-third of its 679 stores by summer's end and cut its work
force by about 18,000 employees, or 36%.
   The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based discount retailer, which has
been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrupty Code
since April, said it planned to submit a strategic plan that
includes the store closings to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
after clearing the plan with its creditors.

   Stephen L. Pistner, a retailing consultant who was brought
in as chief executive of Ames after the bankruptcy filing,
said the massive downsizing would cut expenses and reduce
operating losses. In addition, inventory sales from the
stores targeted for closing are expected to generate about
$180 million in much-needed cash.
   Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst with Seidler Amdec
Securities in Los Angeles, said the cash would help
significantly. "One of the key issues with dealing with Ames
is to buoy the confidence of vendors about the company's cash
flow and financial position. It will indicate that they're
going to have cash flowing in and more cash than vendors had
originally expected," he said.
   Ames filed for bankruptcy court protection after some
vendors had stopped shipping goods to its stores because Ames
couldn't pay for earlier shipments.
   The planned closing of 221 stores, located mainly in
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, will
eventually result in 18,000 layoffs. After the closings, Ames
will have 458 stores in 17 states, primarily in the
Northeast, and about 32,000 employees, the company said. The
store closings are set for August and September.
   Ames estimated that the stores targeted for closing had an
operating loss of $47.5 million for the fiscal year ended
Jan. 27. The company reported a net loss of $228 million for
the year. That loss included a restructuring charge of $137
million for 74 stores and an extraordinary write-off of $8
million for fees related to prepayment of debt.
   Ames said reserves for the additional store closings will
be reflected in its first-quarter results, but declined to
provide an estimate.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ames
closed at $2.375, unchanged.
   Mr. Pistner said any additional store closings would have
to be studied on a case-by-case basis. "We really aren't
concentrating on that now. This is a very important and very
big move. Any other store closings would have to be studied
on an individual basis," he said.
   Ames's troubles largely reflect problems at the Zayre
stores it acquired in 1988. Ames paid $800 million for more
than 300 Zayre stores, with hopes of turning the chain around
by shedding its heavy discounting practice and switching to
an "everyday low price" pitch. Ames renamed and spruced up
the Zayre stores but had little success attracting new
customers, due in part to a sagging economy in the Northeast.
   Of the 221 stores to be closed, 37 are Ames stores and 184
are former Zayre stores.
   Mr. Tashjian described the move as "very quick, deep and
decisive action." He said, "The fastest way to start to make
headway in this situation is to cut off some of the dead
wood, the marginal stores, and clearly that is what Mr.
Pistner has started." He said Ames must also improve cash
flow and regain some of the customers that used to shop in
the original Ames stores.
   Mr. Pistner said the plan is a "critical first step
towards our primary goal of leading Ames out of Chapter 11.
This downsizing will cut our expenses, reduce operating
losses, and allow us to focus our efforts on serving
customers."
   The Ames plan also calls for it to close distribution
facilities in Plant City, Fla., and Worcester, Mass. Upon
approval from the bankruptcy court, Ames said it will
complete construction of a distribution center in Leesport,
Pa., in early 1991.
