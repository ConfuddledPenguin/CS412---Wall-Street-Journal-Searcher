   STOCKHOLM -- Swedish engineering and rock-drilling concern
Atlas Copco AB said Friday it has acquired all of the stock
of Rotoflow Corp. of the U.S.
   Atlas Copco, which declined to disclose the price of the
transaction, said Rotoflow will operate as an independent
company within its Applied Compressor Technique division.
That division focuses its operations on specially built
air-gas compressors, expansion turbines and cryogenic pumps.

   Based in Los Angeles, Rotoflow, a leading company in
turbo-expander technology, is profiting from the growing
demand for natural gas; the company expects sales to reach
$30 million this year, Atlas Copco said.
