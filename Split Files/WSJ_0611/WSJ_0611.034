   WASHINGTON -- The Student Loan Marketing Association,
known as Sallie Mae, said it will price today $600 million of
short-term floating-rate notes, due Dec. 13. Notes will be
offered simultaneously in the U.S. domestic and the
Eurodollar markets.
   The agency said trading is expected to begin at 8:20 a.m.
EDT tomorrow and the notes will settle on Thursday. The notes
will be priced at a spread to the bond-equivalent yield of
the 91-day Treasury bill. The interest rate will be reset on
the day after each weekly Treasury bill auction.
