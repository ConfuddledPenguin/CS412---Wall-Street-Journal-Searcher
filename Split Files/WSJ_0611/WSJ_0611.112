   CHICAGO -- The old adage is, "Rain makes grain." But this
spring, rain is just making mud.
   The wettest spring in about 50 years in much of the
Midwest has prevented so much planting that some economists
are beginning to fear it will worsen inflation in food
prices. Farm chemical companies, already under pressure from
environmental groups, are seeing lower-than-expected sales of
pesticides and fertilizer.

   More than twice the normal amount of rain has fallen in
several Corn Belt states. Many corn farmers weren't able to
complete working in their fields before the start of this
month, generally considered the deadline for giving the crop
enough time to go through its delicate pollination stage
before the peak summer heat begins.
   The rainfall has been heaviest in a crescent-shaped area
that includes southern Indiana, southern Illinois and
Missouri. In Boonville, Ind., Frederick Rauth has been unable
to plant any of his 80 acres in corn. "This has been one of
the wettest springs I can remember," he says. "We can't get
any luck."
   As a result, grain traders are beginning to scrap their
month-old estimates that corn farmers would plant 6% more
acres than last year and that corn production would hit a
four-year high of around 8.1 billion bushels.
   Such a bumper harvest would have begun replenishing
stockpiles that were halved by the 1988 drought. It also
would have eased pressure on food prices, which last year
rose 5.8% for their biggest jump since 1981.
   The corn harvest has more impact on grocery prices than
does any other crop. Corn is used in more food products and
accounts for a large portion of the cost of producing beef,
pork and poultry. Some economists had been assuming that a
large harvest would force corn prices slightly lower this
year. But the price of a bushel of corn is already 12% above
a year ago in some areas.
   While the rain is reviving ground exhausted by the
drought, and could help boost yields on land that did get
planted, many analysts now are estimating that corn farmers
planted only about the same as last year's 72.3 million
acres. As a result, some analysts are trimming their harvest
estimates by as much as 9%.
   This prospect of a smaller-than-expected corn harvest
comes at a time of near-record prices for red meat. Hog
prices have soared nearly 40% in the past year, in part
because of rising exports to Japan and stiff competition
among meatpackers for a tight supply of fattened hogs. The
price of a pork belly used to make bacon has more than
doubled. Retail beef prices have been bouncing around record
levels for several months because the cattle herd is the
smallest since 1961.
   Citing these high meat prices, Paul Prentice, an economist
at Farm Sector Economics Associates, said he is raising his
estimate of 1990 food and beverage price inflation to 6.1%
from 5.9%.
   Most economists will wait until July to determine whether
the potential corn crop is significantly lower than
originally thought, and how that would change their inflation
forecasts. Favorable summer weather compensated for
rain-delayed planting several times in the early 1980s. "We
want to wait and see what happens," said Raymond Daniel, an
economist at WEFA Group, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "We could still see
record corn yields."
   Some crop analysts, however, are already saying that even
a normal July heat wave could push up the price of the corn
futures contract for July delivery by 5%, to $3 a bushel.
   What's more, some meteorologists think that the odds don't
favor benign weather. Based on historical patterns, the
chances of a dry July or August are better than even, said
Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services
Corp., Bedford, Mass.
   For farmers, the poor planting weather is a mixed bag. In
wet states such as Indiana and Illinois, many farmers have
little choice but to sow soybeans on their unplanted acreage.
Although the soybean is a hardier plant than corn, it is less
profitable to grow.
   "This weather is really messing me up," said Paul
Kleinknecht, an Evansville, Ind., farmer who was only able to
sow corn on 80 of the 500 acres he wanted to plant. "I don't
know how much I'll be able to get for beans, but I have to go
on with it just the same."
   On the western edge of the Corn Belt, however, the weather
has been drier. Farmers in parts of South Dakota and Nebraska
got much of their corn planted on schedule and might reap a
windfall if crop prices rise until the harvest.
   "Things are going to start popping soon around here," says
Barney Roling of Salem, S.D., who planted 650 acres of corn
on time.
   The wet weather also has depressed sales for many farm
suppliers. Max Fordyce, owner of Fordyce Feed and Supply in
Ridgeway, Mo., says the poor planting season has cost him
more than $350,000 in sales of fertilizer, seed and
pesticides.
   "It's terrible," he says. "Here it is June and we don't
have a single patch of excellent-looking corn in the county.
The rain has probably cost farmers around here 20% in
acreage, which means more than 20% in lost sales for us."
   Nationwide, the weather is a drag on farm chemical sales,
because corn farmers are the biggest consumers of fertilizer
and pesticides. Before the spring, pesticide industry
officials expected unit sales volume to increase 2% this
season. Now, volume is expected to be about flat compared
with last year.
   Fertilizer manufacturers might be particularly hard hit.
Corn farmers already have been reducing their per-acre usage
of fertilizer as application technology has grown more
sophisticated and environmental concerns have increased. Corn
farmers reduced their application rate by 8% last year, and
some industry analysts expect another decline this spring.
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   It could be a nervous time for world oil markets as
traders look to see whether recent sharp declines in crude
and product prices accelerate, or reverse course as they
already have done once this year.
   A petroleum glut has depressed prices in recent weeks,
with crude traded for July delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ending the week at $16.78 a barrel, up 11
cents on the day but off more than 80 cents for the week.
Market participants have viewed production cuts by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as insufficient
to reduce the oversupply.
   OPEC recently agreed to reduce its output by nearly 1.5
million barrels a day, though its officials felt that
production cuts of around one million barrels would be enough
to satisfy oil markets. But so far, it appears OPEC hasn't
reached that threshold. Any news this week on OPEC's
production level could have a quick impact on prices. In
addition, traders say the market has been so jittery that
even minor news could drive prices.
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa prices, which emerged from a prolonged slump with a
sharp rally recently, may be heading down again. The July
contract dropped $76 a metric ton Friday, the sharpest
one-day decline since a $78 drop last September, to settle at
$1,235.
   A settlement in the eight-day Brazilian dock strike
apparently played a part in the sell-off, although the
walkout wasn't a factor in the recent price advances.
   "Cocoa prices were overinflated by the political upheavals
in the past month in the Ivory Coast, even though it
eventually became evident that they didn't directly affect
the cocoa market," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch, New York.
   "However," she said, "the Brazilian dock strike, which may
have delayed some cocoa shipments, generally tended more to
keep the sellers from becoming aggressive." When that
restraint was lifted with the relatively quick settlement of
the strike, active selling quickly drove down prices, she
said.
   The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer;
Brazil also is a major grower.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices fell Friday despite several sizable
purchases on a tight world market, but prices may show a
delayed reaction this week and recover, analysts said.
   According to analysts and a New York dealer, Chile bought
90,000 tons of sugar; Turkey is seeking to buy 100,000 tons;
and Mexico bought 100,000 tons and is trying to buy 50,000 to
75,000 tons more.
   The July futures contract, nevertheless, eased 0.12 cent a
pound to 13.42 cents. One analyst admitted surprise. "I don't
understand why futures declined," he said Friday. "When you
consider how tight supplies are, the quantity of sugar that
was bought should have had a price-supporting impact. I have
to believe that sometime next week, traders will wake up and
properly react to what has taken place."
   Another analyst, Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds in
Chicago, said, "The world market purchases of sugar were
impressive, and the futures market's downward reaction to
them was disappointing, particularly the liquidation late in
the day."
   Whatever the reason for sellers' aggressiveness, Mr. Platt
said, there could be a change of attitude this week.
