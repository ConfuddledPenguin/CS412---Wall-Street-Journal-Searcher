   OTTAWA -- Canada's leaders patched together a tentative
agreement that would give Quebec special status and end a
bitter constitutional impasse that has revived talk of
independence in the French-speaking province.
   But continuing opposition in English Canada could still
kill the deal, setting off a full-blown political crisis.
Even if the agreement is ratified, Canada's French-English
squabbling won't end soon. The bitter constitutional debate
"opened wounds in the national psyche," said Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney. After seven days of tough bargaining Mr.
Mulroney and the nation's ten provincial premiers signed the
accord Saturday night. "This is a happy day for Canada," Mr.
Mulroney said.

   But Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells refused to endorse
the accord, which he said "is bad" for Canada. He signed only
so he can submit the pact for approval to his legislature in
a free vote or directly to Newfoundlanders in a referendum.
   "The future of the country may indeed be at stake," Mr.
Wells said. Calling it "the most difficult decision I've ever
had to make," he said he couldn't support the agreement. But
"I don't want any responsibility for doing irreparable damage
to this country," he added. Newfoundlanders must make their
decision within the next two weeks.
   The agreement is designed to break a deadlock over the
Meech Lake accord, a package of proposed constitutional
amendments. The Meech Lake accord must be ratified by all ten
provincial legislatures by June 23 to take effect.
   In recent opinion polls a majority of Quebecers said they
would support political independence for their province if
Meech Lake isn't ratified. The accord has become an
enormously powerful symbol in Quebec and is the province's
minimum price for remaining happily in the Canadian
federation.
   Three provinces -- New Brunswick, Manitoba and
Newfoundland -- refused to ratify Meech Lake as drafted and
demanded changes. Mr. Mulroney and the ten premiers spent
more than 70 hours behind closed doors last week trying to
find a compromise. New Brunswick and Manitoba dropped their
opposition to the accord but Mr. Wells wouldn't cave in.
   The Meech Lake accord recognizes Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada and grants certain new powers to all
provinces. The "distinct society" clause is the key sticking
point in the debate.
   Many English Canadians worry that the clause grants Quebec
special powers that would weaken the Canadian federation. In
one recent poll, only 16% of Canadians supported the
implementation of the Meech Lake accord without change.
   A constitutional lawyer, Mr. Wells has emerged as the most
eloquent and determined opponent of the "distinct society"
clause. A vigorous proponent of a strong federal government,
he gained national attention when he engaged in a heated
television exchange in November with Mr. Mulroney on the
Meech Lake accord.
   In Canada's English-speaking provinces, public-opinion
polls give Mr. Wells a much higher rating than Mr. Mulroney
on the constitutional issue.
   But Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa is just as determined
to defend the measure at all costs. He said anything that
alters the clause "directly or indirectly" is unacceptable.
Quebec Vice Premier Lise Bacon said: "When {Mr. Bourassa}
decides something, there isn't any point in arguing with him.
That's the key to his success."
   If the Meech Lake accord dies, Mr. Bourassa will hold the
future of the country in his hands. He will come under
intense pressure in Quebec to seek political independence. He
may know what he will do if the deal falls apart, but he only
broadcasts his intentions when ready.
   "He's the most enigmatic man I've ever met," said Jean-V.
Du fresne, a Montreal political columnist. "He's like a
pretzel. You don't know where he begins and where he ends."
   An economist turned wily career politician, Mr. Bourassa
calls himself a "practical federalist." Quebec nationalists
think he's a devoted federalist while federalists think he's
a Quebec nationalist.
   If it is adopted, some observers say the "distinct
society" measure will lead to constitutional wrangling.
Eugene Forsey, a constitutional authority, said the "distinct
society" clause is "a trap." If Quebec gets new powers from
court interpretations of the clause "the rest of the country
will feel swindled," he said. But if the rulings don't give
Quebec new powers "Quebecers will say they were swindled."
   Other parts of the Meech Lake accord and Saturday's add-on
agreement set the stage for new battles. The premiers agreed
to a heavy agenda of discussions of further constitutional
changes, including reform of the Canadian Senate, an
appointed body, and writing a new preamble to the
constitution. Both are controversial issues.
