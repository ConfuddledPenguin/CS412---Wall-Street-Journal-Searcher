   CINCINNATI -- E.W. Scripps Co. said it reached an
agreement in principle to terminate a joint operating
agreement with Persis Corp.
   Scripps said the move would result in a second-quarter
charge of $23 million, or 30 cents a share. In the year-ago
second quarter, the media company earned $25.1 million, or 32
cents a share.

   Scripps owns the Knoxville News-Sentinel; Persis, based in
Honolulu, owns the Knoxville Journal. Under the joint
operating agreement, the News-Sentinel provides sales,
production and distribution for the Journal. After the
agreement ends, the Journal intends to publish separately.
   As part of the termination agreement, the News-Sentinel
will pay Persis $40 million in lieu of payments the Journal
would have received under the joint operating agreement from
1991 to 2005.
