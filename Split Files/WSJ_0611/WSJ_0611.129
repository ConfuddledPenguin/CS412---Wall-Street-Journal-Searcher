   HAMPTON, N.H. -- Henley Group Inc. said it modified its
plan to reorganize and spin off its two largest operating
units as separate companies.
   Henley said it decided to distribute 35% of the shares of
Pneumo Abex Corp., an aerospace parts company, instead of
100% as originally proposed. It said the planned distribution
of all of the shares of Fisher International Inc., formerly
Fisher Scientific Group Inc., a laboratory equipment maker,
won't be affected.

   The revisions are designed to benefit Henley shareholders
by simplifying the financing arrangements in the
reorganization plan, the company said.
   Henley, spun off from Allied-Signal Corp. four years ago
with 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied's
plans, has been reorganizing and spinning off companies in an
effort to increase shareholder value.
   After the distributions, Henley would continue to hold a
company that makes brakes, a methanol plant in Chile, 14.7
million shares of Itel Corp., and certain other investments.
The company said it expects to liquidate or dispose of those
assets during 1991.

   HENLEY GROUP Inc.'s Pneumo Abex Corp. subsidiary will
continue to own its brakes division after Henley distributes
35% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders. Henley, which dropped an
earlier plan to spin off 100% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders,
would have purchased the brakes division from Pneumo Abex
under the earlier plan, Henley said, clarifying a story in
yesterday's edition.
