   NEW YORK -- The hallways of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
where some of the biggest financial deals of the 1980s were
conceived, turned into a flea market yesterday.
   Some 2,200 people, many wearing shorts and T-shirts,
poured into Drexel's Broad Street headquarters for the start
of a five-day liquidation sale. As part of Drexel's
bankruptcy-law proceedings, the securities firm is selling
all its desks, computers, kitchen equipment and even its
brass coat racks.

   "This will finally be my chance to do business with
Drexel," dentist David Eidman joked, as he and three friends
strolled through the remnants of Drexel's seventh-floor
corporate finance department. They were looking for a
credenza and some chairs for the waiting room of Mr. Eidman's
dental offices. He and his friends stopped to look at the
choices in a series of half-empty Drexel offices that had
been tagged as Lot No. 216, Lot No. 219 and Lot No. 220 by
the auctioneers.
   The most popular stop for visitors was the 10th floor,
where Drexel's equity-trading department once traded millions
of shares a day. A small overhead sign still blinked out in
red letters: "Welcome to Drexel's block trading desk."
Otherwise, though, any trace of stock trading had vanished.
The entire 200-by-100-foot trading floor had been transformed
into a barnlike display of personal computers, printers and
facsimile machines.
   "We're looking for a cheap computer that our children can
get started on," said a couple pushing a baby stroller.
Across the way, Wallace Jefferson, an escalator repairman
with the New York City Transit Authority, unscrewed the back
of a Compaq computer to check the circuitry. "A lot of this
stuff is broken," Mr. Jefferson warned a passerby.
   Ross-Dove Co., which is handling the auction, said the
sale is one of its largest ever. It covers 10 floors of
Drexel's headquarters and seven other buildings in the New
York area, as well as satellite offices in other cities. A
Ross-Dove spokesman predicted that proceeds will be "in the
seven figures" once bidding starts on Wednesday. Yesterday,
today and tomorrow amount to a preview of the collection.
   Those proceeds won't make a big dent in Drexel's overall
finances, but they should generate a little more money with
which to pay creditors.
   For a few visitors yesterday, the chance to roam Drexel's
offices was high adventure. "Look at all these contacts I've
collected," college student Eric Weinstein said. He
cheerfully admitted that he had been opening desk drawers of
former Drexel securities analysts and picking out any
business cards still left in the desks. "I've got the
investor relations guy at Ralston Purina," Mr. Weinstein
said, pulling out a card halfway through his stack. "That
could come in handy some day."
   More commonly, though, visitors said walking through
Drexel's deserted offices was much more melancholy than they
expected. "This is like an estate sale after a funeral," one
woman said.
   At the entryway to Drexel's plush corporate finance
department, the receptionist's L-shaped desk still harbored a
sign that said: "Will Return. Please Wait." Baby photos and
lottery tickets were tucked next to a phone. Two desk
calendars were left open to Feb. 19, the Monday after Drexel
filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
   "I walk through here and I think about all the secretaries
that got laid off," Ross-Dove security guard Deborah Andrews
said. "If I saw one of those people, I'd hug them and say, `I
know just how you feel.'"
   This week's auction doesn't cover Drexel's renowned
Beverly Hills, Calif., office, where financier Michael Milken
worked. Property from that office has already been sold.
   Still, one New York visitor yesterday found an eerie trace
of one of Mr. Milken's top lieutenants. "You want to hear
something sad?" a middle-aged man asked his wife, as they
walked along a seventh-floor corridor. "Look what I found in
the men's room." He held up a three-inch thick blue book with
Drexel's name printed in gold leaf in the center.
   It was an archive copy of the confidential paperwork
involved in one of 1985's biggest takeovers, the acquisition
of Northwest Industries Inc. by financier William Farley.
Drexel had helped finance the deal. That particular copy of
the Farley papers evidently had belonged to star Drexel
deal-maker Leon Black. His name was printed in gold leaf in
the lower righthand corner.
   "Now it's being used as a doorstop," the visitor said.
