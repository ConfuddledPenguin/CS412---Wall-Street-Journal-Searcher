   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Public Service of New Hampshire said
it had a loss of $24 million in one of its three pension plan
investment portfolios during the last two years.
   The utility company said it will have to pay more into the
fund in future years to keep up the asset level. The company
also said that if no recoveries are made, the annual pension
expense will increase by about $1 million annually, from $8.5
million. This increase would not affect customers' bills, the
company added.

   The losses have been offset by gains in Public Service's
other pension portfolios; the overall pension plan has assets
of about $100 million, the company said.
   Public Service said its pension plan's assets are
sufficient to fund all of its obligations to its employees
and retirees.
   Public Service has initiated a review of its investments
that resulted in the losses, and the company will determine
whether any additional remedies are available to recover
them.
