   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Hercules Inc. said it will take an $11
million charge in the second quarter related to closing its
Mica production facility in Culver City, Calif.
   The company said it shut down Mica operations to prevent
"further drain" on earnings. Mica is part of the company's
Electronic &amp; Printing Products business, which Hercules
intends to sell. Mica, which had about 250 employees and was
acquired in 1985, made parts for printed circuits.
