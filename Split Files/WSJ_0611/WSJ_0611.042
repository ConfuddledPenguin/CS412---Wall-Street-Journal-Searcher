   SEABROOK, N.H. -- New Hampshire Yankee, operator of the
Seabrook Station nuclear-power plant, said Ted C. Feigenbaum,

officer, will be named president and chief executive officer
Oct. 1.
   Edward A. Brown, current president and chief executive,
will retire Oct. 1.

   Mr. Brown, 60, said he completed his "mission" at New
Hampshire Yankee -- to get the Seabrook Station built and on
line -- and will now spend more time with his family.
   New Hampshire Yankee was created by Seabrook Station's
joint-owner utility companies to complete the plant's
construction and licensing and to oversee operation of the
facility.
