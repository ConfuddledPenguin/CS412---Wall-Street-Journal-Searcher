   Soviet officials and news agencies are describing the
outbreak of fighting in Central Asia as "inter-ethnic," the
expression that also was applied to eruptions in the
Transcaucasus early this year. The description is at best
superficial and at worst deliberately deceptive. What is
mainly going on in Central Asia is a variation on what is
happening elsewhere in the Soviet Union, including the
Transcaucasus, the Baltic states, Ukraine and now Russia
itself: a rebellion against Soviet authority.
   Central Asia, a wild area inhabited by some of the
country's more primitive peoples, might at first glance seem
to be among the least important territories Mikhail Gorbachev
stands to lose as his vast empire crumbles. The sleepless
nights he complained of to Margaret Thatcher no doubt are
mainly attributable to Boris Yeltsin and what he is doing
with the Russian Federation's legislature. Last Friday it
boldly voted to give its own laws precedence over Soviet
laws, directly challenging Mr. Gorbachev's power.

   But don't underrate Central Asia. Moscow has a vital
interest there. It's called gold.
   The Soviets have been actively selling gold to earn the
foreign exchange they desperately need to pay their debts and
buy food and other necessities. Central Asia's Kyzil-Kum
desert just happens to be a major center of Soviet gold
mining. The region also is a source of other valuable
minerals, uranium, lead, zinc, oil and gas.
   Which helps explain why the Soviets have just dispatched
several thousand troops to Central Asia to stop "inter-ethnic
strife." That expression is getting a bit shopworn.
"Inter-ethnic strife" between Azeris and Armenians was the
excuse for troops shooting their way into the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku early this year. Chess wizard Gary Kasparov,
an Armenian, wrote on this page in late March his belief that
the KGB stirred up the Azeri-Armenian clashes to provide a
pretext for clamping down on nationalist movements. Indeed,
Soviet defense chief Yazov let the cat out by blurting out in
the midst of the slaughter that the troops were sent in to
save the Azeri Communist Party, which had in effect been
deposed by a national front.
   Uzbek-Kirghiz clashes in the Kirghiz capital of Frunze and
along the border of the two republics are of a similar
pattern. Reading between the lines of Tass and official
reports -- the only sources of information as glasnost
doesn't apply to Soviet hot spots -- one finds that a lot of
the popular anger has been directed at state buildings, 31 of
which have been torched. That's anti-government, not
inter-ethnic. Deaths -- 102 at last count -- seem mainly the
result of shooting by the Soviet regular army, KGB border
guards and Interior Ministry forces. That's a lot like Baku.
   Some anonymous KGB officer may deserve a medal for
dreaming up "inter-ethnic strife." It excuses troop action
and can be used to persuade the world that there will be more
strife, and suffering, if nationalism triumphs over authority
in the Soviet empire.
   The idea isn't foolproof. Efforts to stir up "inter-ethnic
strife" between Russian nationals and ethnic Balts seem to
have fizzled. Baltic Russians seem not to have much more love
for Moscow than do the ethnic Balts.
   Central Asia, for its part, is not as backward as some
think. Popular movements, such as "Ashar" in Kirghizia and
"Birlik" in Uzbekistan, have been gaining strength,
exploiting such sources of discontent as the region's
poverty, conscription of local youths and the dumping of
nuclear wastes near Tashkent, the populous Uzbek capital.
Central Asia also has been able to establish some trade and
political contacts with the outside world. According to a
Radio Liberty analysis, the Uzbeks have had a flurry of trade
delegation exchanges with foreign governments, such as
Belgium and South Korea, and with foreign businesses. Saudi
Arabia sent them one million Korans as a goodwill gesture.
More to the point, the Uzbeks have been in the forefront
among those Soviet republics threatening to seize control of
the resources of their own region on grounds that Moscow is
stealing their natural wealth.
   Uzbekistan's prime minister, Shukrulla Rahmatovich
Mirsaidov, recently issued a declaration of "economic
independence" in a speech to the republic's parliament. He
protested what he called Moscow's exploitation of the
republic. He declared that "all of the most valuable elements
of national possession" must henceforth be recognized as the
property of the republic.
   To Moscow, that meant gold, uranium, oil and gas.
"Inter-ethnic strife" and the intervention of Soviet troops
soon followed Mr. Mirsaidov's declaration.
