   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it gave a Single-A rating to
Walt Disney Co.'s $1.5 billion face amount of subordinated
liquid-yield option notes, due 2005. The rating agency also
affirmed Disney's A-1 commercial paper ratings.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said that the company has substantially
increased capital expenditures in recent years. But it said
the proposed financing and expansion projects aren't expected
to significantly alter Disney's capital structure. "Moreover,
the company is likely to be able to maintain returns on
assets and permanent capital at well above average levels,
even if some future investments offer modestly lower returns
than now prevail."

   Walt Disney issued the notes to help pay for the
multibillion-dollar expansion of its U.S. theme parks and
resorts over the next decade.
   A spokesman for Walt Disney, Burbank, Calif., said: "We're
pleased with the rating. It's what we expected."
