   NEW YORK -- Donald Trump has reached a tentative agreement
with his major bankers that would give him time and money to
restructure his troubled real estate and casino empire.
   Under a proposal agreed to over the weekend, the banks
would lend Mr. Trump about $50 million and allow him to
suspend interest payments on about $2 billion in existing
bank loans, according to people familiar with the talks.

   In return, Mr. Trump has pledged some of the remaining
assets that aren't already 100% collateralized. These
properties are believed to include the Trump Plaza Hotel in
Atlantic City, N.J., and the Trump Tower retail and office
space here. In the event of an asset sale, the banks would
get paid only after existing lenders receive their money for
loans on those properties.
   Mr. Trump is also believed to have forfeited equity in
other properties in return for the suspension of interest
payments.
   Also under discussion was a bank proposal for Mr. Trump to
secure the loan with his father Fred Trump's Brooklyn and
Queens apartment portfolio. That proposal was spurned by Mr.
Trump, however.
   The plan's first hurdle will be confronted today when his
biggest creditors, units of Bankers Trust New York Corp.,
Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., are scheduled to meet with about 10 smaller creditors
to discuss the proposal. These 10 banks include Japanese
banks that are believed to have purchased portions of Mr.
Trump's loans through syndications. They are also believed to
include New Jersey banks such as Midlantic National Bank that
have loaned Mr. Trump money for his New Jersey properties.
   "If any one of the other banks do not go along, then the
deal does not work," said a banker involved in the
discussions.
   It is believed that the major banks' contributions toward
the $50 million will be in proportion to the amount they have
lent to Mr. Trump, with Citicorp first, followed by Bankers
Trust, Chase and Manufacturers Hanover.
   The banks declined to comment officially, as did Mr.
Trump, through a spokesman. Officials of Midlantic, a unit of
Midlantic Banks Inc., couldn't be reached.
   If Mr. Trump's smaller creditors give the plan the green
light this week, it appears likely that he will meet a
crucial interest payment on his Trump's Castle casino bonds
Friday. The banks were said to be concerned that if he were
to miss the payment, the New Jersey gambling licenses for all
three of his casinos would be endangered. No banker would
confirm or deny that the payment would be made, however.
   The agreement comes after two weeks of round-the-clock
discussions between the banks, Mr. Trump and his adviser,
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. Mr. Trump approached the banks after
it became clear that New York City's real-estate slump
coupled with a downturn in the Atlantic City gambling market
would make it difficult for him to make his interest payments
this year.
   Adding to Mr. Trump's difficulties has been a series of
recent purchases, such as the Plaza Hotel and the Trump
Shuttle airline, which have been money-losers so far.
   If the smaller creditors agree to the plan, it will give
Mr. Trump much-needed breathing room to improve his
operations and wait out New York City's real-estate slump.
The idea of the plan, say bankers who participated in the
talks, is to give Mr. Trump enough time to work his problems
out so he won't be forced to sell his major assets at
fire-sale prices.
   "We want the bottom-fishers to go away," said one
participant in the talks. "There's value in the assets, but
now might not be the best time to sell them."
   The value of the Plaza Hotel and a 72-acre parcel of
vacant land on Manhattan's Upper West Side could soar if the
real-estate market improves, the banker said.
   The banks' decision to advance Mr. Trump more funds was
based both on their faith in his ability to manage his way
out of his troubles and their fear that if they squeezed him
too hard, he would seek protection in bankruptcy court, said
people familiar with the negotiations.
   As part of the plan, the banks also want Mr. Trump to make
changes in his glitzy lifestyle and in his management style.
One banker who participated in the talks said he was
impressed that Mr. Trump understood the seriousness of the
situation and appeared willing to make such changes.
   "Many entrepreneurs faced with the same downturn in their
business don't recognize what they have to do," the banker
said.
