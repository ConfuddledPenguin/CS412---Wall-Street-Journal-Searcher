   Future historians may pinpoint last Friday as the date
communism finally conceded the rhetorical war. With a
visiting Margaret Thatcher sitting beside him and nodding in
approval, Mikhail Gorbachev told a live, televised news
conference in Moscow that the creation of a market economy in
the Soviet Union was "essential." When reminded of criticism
that he was abandoning communism, Mr. Gorbachev went further

Soviet leader declared. "It has existed for centuries. It is
an invention of civilization."
