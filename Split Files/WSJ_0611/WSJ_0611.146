   NORWOOD, Mass. -- Microcom Inc., citing overstocking by
distributors of its software products, said it expects to
report a loss of 15 cents to 20 cents a share for the first
quarter, ending June 30, on revenue of $14 million.
   In the year-ago period, the workstation connectivity
company had net income of $2.5 million, or 29 cents a share,
on revenue of $17 million.

   James M. Dow, president and chief executive officer, said
it is "unlikely" that Microcom's distributors will "require
significant additional product shipments . . . prior to June
30."
