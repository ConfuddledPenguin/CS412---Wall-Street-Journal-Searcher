   MADRID -- Mercapital S.A., a Spanish financial company 25%
owned by Cie. Financiere de Suez of France, said it will take
a 40% stake in Spanish brokerage firm Usera &amp; Morenes.
   The accord, reached after several weeks of talks, is
designed to strengthen Mercapital's position in the
financial-services market, a spokesman said.

   It also reflects the growing difficulties for independent
brokerage firms in Spain's increasingly competitive stock
market.
   Usera &amp; Morenes, set up last year as a partnership between
three stockbrokers at the time of changes on Spain's stock
market, was for much of last year one of Spain's market
leaders. But it ran into problems in relation to an inquiry
by the Spanish National Stock Market Commission into
irregularities allegedly committed at the time of a stock
offering by oil company Repsol S.A. last year.
   Though no sanctions have been announced against Usera &amp;
Morenes, the negative publicity caused by the allegations led
to a fall in its business in the first quarter of this year.
At the same time, staffing problems forced it to slash staff
by around 50%, contributing to a first-quarter loss of 212
million pesetas ($2 million).
   Following its acquisition, the brokerage firm will become
a direct subsidiary of Mercapital's banking unit, Bancapital.
The price of the purchase will depend on an audit of the firm
currently in process, Mercapital said. Bancapital is 35%
owned by Mercapital and has four offices, in Madrid,
Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.
