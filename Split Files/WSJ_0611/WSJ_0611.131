   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario -- Algoma Steel Corp. said it
hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to find a buyer for its U.S. coal
and iron ore interests.
   Algoma Steel, a unit of Dofasco Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada's largest steelmaker, said its coal interests consist
of four operations in West Virginia. Last year these
operations produced about three million net tons of steam
coal and 1.6 million net tons of metallurgical coal.

   Algoma Steel said its U.S. iron ore operations are held
through its partnership interests in the Tilden Mine near
Ishpeming, Mich. The company said its share of production at
the mine is 2.6 million tons a year.
   Other owners of the Tilden mine are Stelco Inc. of
Hamilton and Cleveland-based Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., which
also manages the mine. Cleveland-Cliffs said total production
at Tilden this year is expected to be 6.5 million tons.
   Algoma Steel, which didn't disclose an asking price, said
the planned sale is consistent with the company's strategy of
focusing on its core steel manufacturing business. It said
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to
reduce debt.
