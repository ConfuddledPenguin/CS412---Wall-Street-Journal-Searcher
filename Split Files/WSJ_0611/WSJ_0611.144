   Boston -- When two girls called 12-year-old Tanisha a
"nigger" on her school bus here, Tanisha was stung. Her best
friend, Jennifer, who is white, wanted to defend her, but
didn't know how.
   Should they hit the girls? Come back with an insult of
their own? Wait and tell an adult? Or just ignore the pair,
and console each other? "I would tell the driver," says
four-year-old Kate Goldsworthy while watching Tanisha talk
about this encounter in an interactive video that's part of a
new exhibit at the Children's Museum here.

   "The Kids Bridge" aims to get visitors talking and
thinking about racial differences and to reduce racism by
having them see things from other kids' points of view.
   All that's not easy at a children's museum, where hundreds
of screaming youngsters run through halls poking at exhibits
such as a giant nose that sneezes on command. But because the
museum draws so many children (about 270,000 a year), it is a
logical place to expose them to things they might not
normally see.
   "For the first time, a cultural institution has addressed
the issues of racism and cultural discrimination for kids,"
says Gail Eaton of the museum. "We hope that somehow, in the
car on the way home, kids will talk about racism . . . {with
a} new awareness."
   To get to "The Kids Bridge" visitors must first pass the
popular Climbing Sculpture, a three-story jungle gym-type
structure that holds more than 30 kids at a time -- and cross
a 46-foot-long footbridge into a setting suggesting Greater
Boston at dusk.
   The idea is to help children "bridge" things that seem
separated. Interactive videos take visitors on treasure hunts
through racially isolated and stereotyped Boston
neighborhoods, guided by children from those neighborhoods.
Other interactive videos show real children, not actors,
talking about racial incidents involving black, Vietnamese
and Hispanic children. Viewers learn that many children are
harassed because of their race and that it's OK to talk about
it.
   Another video, "Talking to Each Other," has five
Boston-area children teaching words in their native
languages. Three sound booths play cross-cultural lullabies;
and a diorama of different Boston neighborhoods lets kids
peek at a Chinese family celebrating a baby's First Moon (his
first 30 days of life), and other moments from the real lives
of the city's citizens.
   The exhibit was prompted by a local government study that
predicts 54% of Boston's population will consist of groups
currently considered minorities by 1995. Right now, Boston
has about a 38% minority population. Aylette Jenness and
Joanne Rizzi, co-directors of the museum's multicultural
program, spent three years creating the exhibit and were
helped by more than 100 local corporations and foundations,
and a multiracial committee of community members. "The Kids
Bridge" cost $500,000 and will remain at the museum for at
least five years.
   More than 80,000 people have visited the exhibit since it
opened in April, including almost 42,000 children aged 2 to
14. But in a city like Boston, which still bears scars from
the school integration battle of the 1970s, the full impact
of the exhibit remains uncertain.
   "We wanted to do an exhibit that spoke to the needs of
Boston," says Ms. Jenness. "The buzzword is, by the end of
this century, people of color will be the majority in this
country. Parents haven't necessarily prepared their children
for that."
   Indeed, not every child visiting the exhibit early one
afternoon seemed particularly keen on learning about other
cultures. Some visitors, such as a seven-year-old girl from
suburban Belmont, spend more time listening to the English
version of words in an interactive video than to the Haitian
Creole, Cantonese, Spanish or Cambodian Khmer versions. The
girl shrugged her shoulders when asked if she would react
differently now to name-calling at school. Others could
hardly sit still long enough to listen to the words in the
music booths or put together a puzzle of multiracial
families.
   Still, some children, like Debbie Goff, 9, of Worcester,
Mass., got so engrossed in the exhibit that they had to be
pulled away by parents and school staff. Debbie spent almost
30 minutes at the foreign-language interactive video, before
her grandfather urged her to move on. She learned words like
"thanks" in Haitian Creole ("mesi"), and "boyfriend" in
Spanish ("novio"). Nine-year-old Peter McCarthy of suburban
Belmont spent 15 minutes searching for an Irish claddagh ring
(a symbol of friendship and love) as part of a treasure hunt
in a different video.
   And Kate Goldsworthy came up with four or five solutions
to handling the racial taunts hurled at Tanisha on the school
bus. When her mother suggested that telling the bus driver
mightn't be possible because he could be too busy driving,
Kate said, "I would tell the teacher when I got to school . .
. If someone called me names and threw snowballs at me in my
front yard, I'd feel upset. I'd run and tell my mother."
   "The Kids Bridge" has been received enthusiastically by
Boston-area schools, says Leslie Swartz, director of teacher
services for the museum. But she adds that the museum hopes
the exhibit will be only a starting point that will encourage
schools to continue teaching kids about racism and ethnic
diversity.
   To give schools a nudge, the museum is offering teacher
training seminars this summer that will study in detail the
various ethnic groups living in Boston. The museum also is
developing a multicultural curriculum that can be used in
Boston classrooms. So far, about 30 teachers have signed up
for the training program.
   "The exhibit . . . {is} a jumping off point for a lot of
teachers who wish to address this issue in their classrooms,"
says Bessie Lyman, director of Black Achievement, a Newton
public schools office that works with staff, students and
parents to close the gap of achievement between blacks and
non-blacks.
   Teachers in Newton had been searching for a way to show
children that diversity is a plus, says Mrs. Lyman. "The
exhibit is precisely what we wanted to address. It's
important for children to be exposed to people of other
cultures and races {in more ways than} just one line in a
textbook about slaves and the Holocaust," she says.
