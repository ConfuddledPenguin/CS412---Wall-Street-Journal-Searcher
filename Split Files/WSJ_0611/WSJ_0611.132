   NEW YORK -- For all their computers telling them which
market is the better-valued investment, tactical asset
allocators are performing dismally.
   They have sat out much of the recent stock market rally
with bonds and cash stuffed in their portfolios. Though
they're breathing a little easier after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average retreated 2.5% from last Monday's record,
many asset allocators still lag behind the market by 2% or
more.

   "They've been a huge disappointment since November 1987,"
says James A. Carmack, whose firm specializes in analyzing
tactical asset allocators' performance. "But prior to that
they were the teacher's pet with excellent results of
protecting assets." Over the past few years, most asset
allocators have been lucky to tie market benchmarks such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   This is a highly disciplined school of investors that uses
sophisticated computer models to blend the right mix of
stocks, bonds and cash to preserve capital while keeping up
with the indexes. Once they chart their course, tactical
allocators usually stick to it come what may, which sometimes
means watching in humiliation as their models crash and burn.
But because of their rigid discipline, they are often the
first to discern changes in the stock market's behavior.
   Among the things tactical asset allocators are learning
about the current market, three stand out:
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors aren't demanding as much reward as they used
to for the risk of owning stocks.
                                                                                                       

   Andrew Harmstone, a vice president at J.P. Morgan
Investment Management, has a negative view of the stock
market as reflected in his current standard account mix of
25.3% stocks, 58.3% bonds and 16.4% cash.
   One of the most important value-measuring tools in Mr.
Harmstone's model is the risk of holding stocks relative to
bonds. Historically, investors want stocks to deliver a
return -- price change plus dividends -- of about 2.3
percentage points more than bonds to compensate them for
volatility and risk.
   But these days, Mr. Harmstone's model tells him that
investors are accepting a "risk premium" in stocks of a mere
0.9 percentage point above returns on bonds. "It's possible
that investors are becoming more tolerant, more complacent
about risk," he says. If that's true, Mr. Harmstone may have
to change his model.
   But he doesn't think that's the case. Sooner or later, he
says, the risk of owning stocks at current prices will make
itself apparent to investors. Mr. Harmstone suggests negative
earnings surprises could be the catalyst.
   However it starts, Mr. Harmstone strongly believes the
historical "risk premium" of stocks over bonds will be
restored by both a retreat in stock prices and a decline in
bond yields -- which pushes up bond prices -- with the
sharper adjustment in stocks.
   That's why he's heavily weighted in bonds, which his model
says are priced cheaply compared with the slowing rate of
inflation.
   Susan Byrne, who manages the $65 million Westwood Fund,
has higher exposure to stocks than Mr. Harmstone. But since
the end of 1989 she has cut her stock exposure to 70.2% from
86.1% and raised bond exposure to 26.7% from 1.8%.
   Ms. Byrne's economic model for 1990 is forecasting a 5%
rise in S&amp;P 500 earnings, no gain in inflation, and economic
growth of about 2%. That means about a 5% to 8% gain for
stocks this year, which is slightly less competitive than her
model's predicted returns on bonds.
   Ms. Byrne is unimpressed by the Dow's recent run to new
records. "If the Dow Jones industrials go to 3000 this year,
you could have captured that return on a CD," she says. The
higher the market goes, the more risk, she thinks, because
her model indicates the risk of recession is greater than
more expansive growth. Expectations of lower earnings could
send stocks down 12% to 15% this year, she says.
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors are placing a higher value on future earnings
growth than underlying assets.
                                                                                                       

   Michael FitzGerald and Richard Boling, managing directors
at TSA Capital Management, invest about $1.5 billion with
asset allocation strategies. TSA values stocks according to
earnings yield, the movement of stock prices over time --
what technical analysts call "momentum" -- and a proprietary
model that takes account of economic data.
   Currently, TSA's value model says stocks are too expensive
relative to earnings. "Earnings yield by the way we measure
it is about 7.25% on the S&amp;P 500," says Mr. FitzGerald, which
doesn't compete with current returns of about 8.4% on
Treasury securities. Even so, TSA has recently sold out of
its bond position, which dragged down performance when
interest rates rose sharply this spring, and is now 100%
invested in stocks.
   One reason for their apparent heresy, Messrs. Boling and
FitzGerald say, is that traditional valuation measures are
being ignored to some extent by many other investors. "The
market isn't focusing on value -- neither dividend yield,
price-to-book ratios or price-earnings ratios," says Mr.
FitzGerald. "The market may be focusing on growth in
earnings."
   The "100% stock" signal Messrs. Boling and FitzGerald are
following comes from their momentum and economic indicators:
Investors are anticipating strong future earnings growth and
don't think stock prices reflect that earnings potential at
today's prices.
   "We fully believe that stocks will be the best-performing
asset in the coming days," Mr. FitzGerald says.
   Ms. Byrne also thinks that the stock market is focusing on
future earnings growth, but adds that many growth stocks of
the 1980s, such as those of consumer companies, are probably
overvalued.
   Her current 70.2% stock position has a heavy weighting in
drug stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Schering-Plough and
Syntex -- all of which are undervalued on the basis of
predicted future earnings growth.
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors correctly anticipated that rising interest
rates would cool inflation.
                                                                                                       

   Last year, when short-term rates rose above 9%, TSA stuck
with a large cash position. But stocks in 1989 turned in one
of the best returns of the decade. "When short-term interest
rates are rising," Mr. FitzGerald says, "normally that's a
very bad time to hold stocks and you want to be in cash. And
that's what our model showed."
   With benefit of hindsight, Mr. FitzGerald figures that
stock investors viewed the rise in short-term interest rates
as a positive influence on future earnings growth. High
short-term rates would help cool inflation, and
inflation-adjusted earnings therefore would be stronger down
the road.
   As a result, 1989 "was a good year for stocks in spite of
the fact that most asset allocation models thought 9% cash
was the place to be," says Mr. FitzGerald. The S&amp;P was up
31.68% last year while TSA's asset allocation portfolios were
up about 17%.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the fourth
consecutive day, tumbling 34.95 to 2862.38 on moderate New
York Stock Exchange volume of 142.6 million shares. The
four-day loss of 72.81 points followed Monday's record high
of 2935.19. For the week, the industrial average lost 38.59
points, or 1.3%.
   Stock-index arbitrage, in which traders sell stocks and
buy stock-index futures to lock in price differences,
accounted for part of Friday's decline, traders said. Futures
became cheaper than underlying stocks as large investors
turned bearish on the market and sold Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index futures.
   Adding to the selling pressure were falling bond prices
and stock investors looking to lock in some of their profits
before the weekend. The latest round of profit-taking focused
on the entertainment, retailing and financial stocks.
   Last week's setback broke a string of five consecutive
weekly advances, over which the average rallied a total of
255.22 points, or 9.6%; the winning streak was the longest
since last summer.
   Declining stocks routed advancers on the Big Board by
1,010 to 458. S&amp;P's 500-stock index dropped 4.44 to 358.71
for a 1.1% loss for the week, while the New York Stock
Exchange composite index fell 2.16 Friday to 196.05 for a 1%
decline. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index
skidded 2.40 to 361.17, ending the week with a loss of 0.7%.
   Profit-taking hit several entertainment stocks. Walt
Disney fell 4 7/8 to 123 3/8, Time Warner declined 2 7/8 to
107 3/4 and MCA dropped 1 3/4 to 56 3/4.
   News Corp., which owns Twentieth Century Fox Film, bucked
the group's downturn. It rose 3/4 to 17 1/2; the debt-laden
company said Thursday that it plans to sell a 49% interest in
South China Morning Post Holdings Ltd.
   Gap Inc. fell 2 3/8 to 56 1/8 after analysts cut their
earnings estimates for the second quarter and full year of
fiscal 1991 in response to weak sales data.
   Other specialty retailers also sagged amid profit-taking.
Limited Inc. fell 1 to 46 3/8, Lowe's fell 1 to 45 1/2, Home
Depot dropped 5/8 to 56 3/4 and Rite Aid slid 1 to 33 3/8.
   Several insurance stocks also fared worse than the market,
including Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, down 1 1/4 to 26
5/8. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty lost 7/8 to 52, Travelers fell 5/8
to 31, Cigna slid 1 7/8 to 52 3/4, General Re fell 2 5/8 to
87 1/8, Marsh &amp; McLennan fell 2 3/8 to 76 3/8 and Loews lost
3 1/4 to 112 5/8.
   Other weak financial issues were Manufacturers Hanover,
down 7/8 to 36 5/8; Merrill Lynch, down 1 1/8 to 23 3/4;
Golden West Financial, down 1 3/8 to 33 3/8, Security
Pacific, down 1 5/8 to 41 1/8, and Sovran Financial, down 1
to 32 1/2.
   Among technology stocks, International Business Machines
dropped 1 7/8 to 118 3/4, Compaq Computer fell 2 5/8 to 119
1/8, Texas Instruments lost 1 5/8 to 39 3/8 and Motorola
tumbled 2 3/8 to 83 1/2.
   Maytag jumped 2 to 19 on 1.1 million shares amid rumors
that the company could attract a foreign suitor. Maytag
declined to comment on the activity in its shares.
   Campbell Soup rose 3/4 to 59 1/4 on renewed speculation
that the company may become a takeover target. Campbell
declined to comment.
   ConAgra gained 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 after agreeing to acquire
Beatrice, which would give the company such brand names as
Hunt's and Wesson and boost its clout in the grocery
business.
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines gained 5/8 to 18 3/4. The company
confirmed that the Argentine government has invited it to
participate with a group studying the privatization of the
country's national airline.
   McDermott International added 3/8 to 30 on a positive
report in Business Week magazine's "Inside Wall Street"
column.
   Rohr Industries gained 1 to 23 7/8 on an analyst's bullish
comments on the company's earnings prospects.
   Guardsman Products fell 1 1/8 to 12 3/4 after the company
said it is less optimistic than previously about its
second-quarter and 1990 results.
