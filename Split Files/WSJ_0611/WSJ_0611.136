   NEW YORK (AP) -- An inquiry by State Attorney General
Robert Abrams into the finances of a newspaper sold by the
homeless is now focusing on the paper's founder Hutchinson
Persons, who quit last week, a spokesman said Saturday.
   New York Newsday, quoting sources, reported that employees
of Street News have told the attorney general's office that
as much as $250,000 is unaccounted for.

   "We received reports that he may have left and may have
taken money with him. We're investigating those charges,"
said a spokesman for Mr. Abrams.
   A message left on Mr. Persons's answering machine wasn't
immediately returned, but he and others have said repeatedly
that those who started the paper six months ago worked for
little or no money until he accepted a salary of less than
$50,000 early this year.
   Wendy Koltun, the paper's co-founder who left Street News
in January in a disagreement over Mr. Persons's management
style, said she was confident the allegations that Mr.
Persons took money were false.
   She said she believes the rumors about him taking money
began with a disgruntled employee who wanted to start her own
newspaper.
   Street News began publishing in November. It has been sold
on streets and subways around Manhattan by homeless people
who keep 50 cents of the 75 cents for each sale.
