   SURREY, England -- Vijay Mallya is 34 years old, rich,
overweight and saddled with one of the least enviable
nicknames in Indian business: "superbrat." He is also, as
chairman of the giant UB Group, one of India's most ambitious
tycoons.
   In 1983, Mr. Mallya inherited a liquor empire that his
father built through shrewd acquisitions and by personally
inspecting invoices. The son has a different style -- he
likes computers, corporate jets and subordinates with MBAs.
He is determined to build the first Indian multinational,
even if Indian tax and foreign-exchange regulations force him
to run it from England and Dubai.

   Also, he's tired of the stigma of being a liquor baron in
tradition-bound India. To get greater social standing, Mr.
Mallya is altering his empire in the same hungry way he
collects yachts, thoroughbred horses and vintage Rolls
Royces.
   "I could have retired at the age of 28 and had a very
comfortable life," says Mr. Mallya in his snug Surrey study.
"But I had this burning desire to prove myself. And that
ambition has grown."
   It remains to be seen if Mr. Mallya's expansion plans will
succeed. But his story illustrates the startling generational
change taking place in largely family controlled Indian
industry. Superbrats like Mr. Mallya are bringing new ideas,
methods and collaborations into India -- with mixed approval
from their elders.
   "My age is my worst liability," Mr. Mallya concedes.
"Indians cannot stomach the fact that a 34-year-old is
running a company this size."
   UB Group goes back to 1948, when Vittal Mallya, Mr.
Mallya's father, used stock-market profits to buy three
British-owned breweries and a food company in newly
independent India. Eight years later, he bought McDowell &amp;
Co., a wine and spirits trading house, which he converted
into a distiller.
   By the 1970s, his company was the second-largest distiller
and brewer in India. But in 1977, the government of Prime
Minister Morarji Desai declared prohibition. It was then that
the elder Mr. Mallya took a gamble and purchased four
breweries and six distilleries.
   The Desai government fell, prohibition was canceled and
the group was suddenly India's largest liquor company. About
the same time, Vittal Mallya acquired an electrical-works
company in Mysore and a petrochemical plant. "He not only
took a very bold step forward in our traditional business,"
says Mr. Mallya. "But he also started hedging our bets."
   By 1983, when the older Mr. Mallya died, the group had
annual sales of 2.3 billion rupees ($220 million at 1983
exchange rates) and was in the alcohol and food businesses,
petrochemicals, batteries and pharmaceuticals (as Indian
partner of Hoechst AG of West Germany).
   Young Mr. Mallya, the only child, was 28 that year. After
university studies, he spent years in various factories
connected with the group, including distilleries in central
India, a Hoechst unit in New Jersey and six months as a
production foreman in a Bristol, England, paint factory. He
worked hard and partied even harder. By his late 20s, Mr.
Mallya had earned a reputation for his social life.
   Today, to hold together a fast-growing and widespread
empire, he takes 20 to 40 airplane flights a month, works
past midnight and spends hours a day at the telephone. He
reserves weekends for expensive pastimes, including his 110
racehorses and 150 vintage cars. He likes parties, jewelry
and yachts -- he owns a 70-footer in England and a 40-footer
in Bombay.
   Many wondered if the playboy could handle the family
empire. But with the family controlling 51% of UB, he had no
trouble dismissing others' claims to the throne. He took over
on Oct. 19, 1983.
   "That's when the 12- and 14-hour working days started," he
says. "When I sat in the chair and had 10 directors sitting
around me, I realized the buck stops with me. There was no
daddy upstairs to go running to.
   "I sat down with a huge piece of paper," he recalls, "drew
boxes and lines and found that every manager in the group
reported to the chairman. Every single invoice from every UB
company came to him: He went through them randomly to see
that the billing was right." Mr. Mallya reorganized. "From 40
people reporting to me, it shrunk to 10."
   Then he looked for ambitious people to fill management
positions. "I wanted people who were young, who could relate
to my youth," he says. Mr. Mallya is unabashed in his desire
to get rid of older employees, and is even considering
lowering the retirement age.
   In 1986, Mr. Mallya assigned his new managers his ultimate
dream: to expand even more than his father had beyond UB's
traditional business of alcohol and beer, a "mighty cash
cow," he says, but a distinctly unholy one in India, where
devout Hindus eschew alcohol.
   While diversifying into electronics, petrochemicals,
telecommunications and biotechnology, Mr. Mallya and his MBAs
began a global hunt for acquisitions and partnerships. To
escape foreign-exchange and tax regulations in India, he
declared himself a "nonresident Indian" in 1987, a status
that limits to 179 each business year the number of days he
can be in India. He manages his interests from mansions in
southern India, Dubai and Surrey, and from his own British
Aerospace 125 jet.
   The group's biggest planned investment is a $588 million
naphtha cracker, plus $470 million in downstream
petrochemical projects. The group has set up a
telecommunications joint venture with Atea N.V. of Belgium,
which is majority-owned by Siemens AG of West Germany and
L.M. Ericsson AB of Sweden. Pharmaceuticals operations,
including the joint venture with Hoechst, are being expanded,
and a new joint venture with Pharmacia AB of Sweden will make
health-care products.
   For the year ended March 31, Mr. Mallya estimates 12
billion rupees ($694.4 million at current rates) in net
sales, five times what it was when he inherited the company.
Only 23% of sales currently comes from liquor and beer. He
expects an operating profit of 800 million rupees, with 38%
of that contributed by the liquor and beer businesses.
