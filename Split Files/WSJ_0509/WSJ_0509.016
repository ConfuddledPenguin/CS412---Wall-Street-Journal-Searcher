   LONDON -- Wellhead crude-oil production by the 13 member
countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in April totaled 23.5 million barrels a day, down
from a revised 24 million barrels a day in March, the
International Energy Agency reported.
   The Paris-based agency said in its monthly "Oil Market
Report" that OPEC countries also produced 1.9 million barrels
a day of natural-gas liquids and condensates in April,
unchanged from March.

   The agency said its preliminary figures put world oil
supply in April at 54.2 million barrels a day, down from 54.6
million barrels a day in March, but in line with an average
54.2 million barrels a day for the first quarter. April's
decline was "due almost entirely to a decrease in OPEC
production," the IEA said.
