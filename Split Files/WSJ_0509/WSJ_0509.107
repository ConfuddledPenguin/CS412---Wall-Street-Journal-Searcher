   Hadson Corp., Oklahoma City, said it entered a joint
venture agreement with a Westmoreland Coal Co. unit to build
a $275 million, coal-fired power plant in North Carolina.
   The energy and defense concern said it expects to complete
the project in late 1993. The plant will sell power to
Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co.'s North Carolina Power &amp; Light
affiliate, the company said.

   Hadson said it also signed an amended agreement to build
an $85 million gas-fired power plant near Albany, N.Y. Hadson
had planned to run the plant with coal, but changed the plans
for environmental reasons, the company added.
