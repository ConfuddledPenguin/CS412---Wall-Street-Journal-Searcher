in East Germany after starting commercial banking operations
there July 2, the day monetary union between East and West
Germany is set to begin.
   Hilmar Kopper, chairman of West Germany's largest bank,
said he is confident that Deutsche Bank can begin providing a
wide range of banking services in about 100 branches in East
Germany on that day, using buildings and employees provided
by its joint venture with Deutsche Kreditbank AG, the
