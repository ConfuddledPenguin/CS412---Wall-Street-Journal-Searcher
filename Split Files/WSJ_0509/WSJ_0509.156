   Oil futures prices rose but then retreated from daily
highs yesterday as threats of supply shortages, following
closure of a major pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico and a
refinery fire in California, subsided.
   West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery settled at
$18.28 a barrel, up one cent from Monday. During the trading
session, however, crude prices had surged more than 30 cents
beyond that level.

   Crude oil supplies remain more than ample. But reports
that production platforms supplying 95,000 barrels a day from
the Gulf of Mexico to onshore refineries had been shut down
because of a pipeline leak made traders wary of selling.
   The pipeline, operated by Texaco Inc., leaked about 900
barrels of crude oil into Gulf waters before it was closed
off early Monday. Late yesterday, divers were still unable to
search for the source of the leak because of choppy seas and
high winds, a Texaco spokesman said. The production,
equivalent to five or six cargoes of crude per month, will be
unavailable for an indefinite period, he said.
   A fire at a Chevron Corp. refinery in El Segundo, Calif.,
also made traders jumpy. But it was quickly extinguished and
appeared to do little damage. And market participants
continued to be concerned about possible disruptions of
near-term supply from North Sea oil installations because of
threatened work stoppages there.
   Also lending support to prices yesterday were pledges by
the oil ministers of Nigeria and Indonesia to cut production
in support of the agreement reached by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last week.
   Prices of petroleum products followed the upward move of
crude oil, although the gains were sharper. Inventories of
both distillate and gasoline are leaner than crude stocks,
making the prices of those commodities more sensitive to news
of potential supply stoppages.
   Figures released by the American Petroleum Institute late
yesterday also show that U.S. imports of both products fell
last week. And gasoline output by U.S. refineries declined
slightly, the report shows, a factor that could buttress
prices for that fuel as the beginning of the summer driving
season draws near.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. June delivery gold
slipped $2 an ounce to $372 after trading as high as $375.20.
July silver was off three cents an ounce to $5.0580. July
platinum declined $5.40 an ounce to $479.20. The possibility
that South Africa and the Soviet Union, the two largest gold
producers, might have to sell gold is hanging over the
market, said William O'Neill, vice president of research for
Elders Futures Inc., New York. He noted that South Africa had
reported a 17.3% decline in its foreign exchange holdings in
March, to $864 million from $1.06 billion in February. "This
is an exceptionally low level and the concern is that it
might sell gold to increase its foreign exchange," Mr.
O'Neill said. He also cited a Wall Street Journal story that
reported the Soviet Union may be having problems making
payments on its U.S. grain purchases. Separately, the
Commodity Exchange said it changed the original margin
requirement for gold and silver contracts. Effective at the
close of trading today, original margin for speculative gold
trading will be cut to $1,300 from $1,700 per contract. The
margin for hedge trading will be dropped to $1,000, from
$1,300. Margin for speculative silver will be cut to $1,300
from $1,400. The hedge remains the same at $1,000. The
speculative and hedge margin requirements on copper and
aluminum will remain the same. Comex margin requirements are
retroactive, applying to existing positions.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices recovered most of Monday's losses.
The soon-to-expire May delivery was up 3.20 cents a pound to
$1.2040, while the most-active July contract rose 2.50 cents
to $1.1215. Analysts said there were no new developments.
"The market sagged Monday, when London was closed, and
recovered when it reopened," said one analyst. The principal
factor in the market, analysts said, was tight supplies,
which caused the premiums of soonest-to-expire contracts to
widen over more deferred positions in both London and New
York. A second analyst observed that some support could be
attributed to May traditionally being the heaviest
copper-consuming month of the year. Negotiations with some
North American copper mining companies on new labor contracts
already have begun, which also may have been a price-firming
factor, he said.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rose on concern that exchange
supplies of the concentrate may be insufficient to meet
commitments on the soon-to-expire May contract. May prices
ended with a gain of three cents a pound at $1.9680. Notices
of intent to deliver concentrate against May contracts began
to be issued May 1, but only 386 notices have been issued so
far, said analyst Judith Gaines of Merrill Lynch. The open
interest, or the number of outstanding May futures that have
to be nullified either by an opposite trade or delivery of
the commodity, amounts to 1,240 contracts. But supplies of
concentrate in exchange warehouses certified for delivery
against the May contract amount to the equivalent of only 584
contracts. The last trading day for May delivery orange juice
is May 17. Ms. Ganes noted that a majority of the May open
interest comprises speculative short sellers who either have
to deliver the concentrate or liquidate their positions by
buying back contracts. However, yesterday it was the July
contract that rose sharply, advancing 4.50 cents a pound to
$1.9625 cents. Ms. Ganes said that "there was buying back of
contracts by traders who were short May, and these traders
then bought twice the quantity of contracts in July." The
result was that May was strengthened by the buying, but July
more so because of the larger demand, she said. Separately,
Ms. Ganes noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will
issue its monthly revision of the Florida orange crop
tomorrow. The figure for Valencia oranges is expected to
rise, she said, but it won't have any effect on the supply of
concentrate. "Last year at this time, 50% of the Valencia
crop remained to be processed," Ms. Ganes said. "This year,
because of the December frost, there is only a fraction of
that. Processing plants have been closing over the past two
weeks as current crop supplies have petered out, and they
aren't going to reopen to process the late trickle of
Valencias."
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and cattle futures
contracts sank sharply as traders moved to take profits on
recent rallies. For June delivery, hogs were down 1.32 cents
a pound to 63.57 cents, and live cattle were down 1.27 cents
a pound to 73.92 cents, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The sell-off began after several contracts in both pits hit
life-of-contract highs. "There wasn't any significant piece
of news," said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton, Chicago. "It just had been a while since a good
correction." Hog prices have been rising since early February
because of an unusual drop in the amount of hogs being
slaughtered in the U.S. The supply of mature hogs ready for
slaughter has been tight in part because farmers have been
cautious about expanding their herds since late 1988, when
many suffered an unprofitable spell. Cattle prices were also
depressed by profit-taking. However, cattle prices have been
widely projected to fall as the slaughter increases this
summer.
