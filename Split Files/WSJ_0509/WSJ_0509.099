   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. filed a countersuit against
former Chairman William F. Farah in a county court here,
seeking to bar him from the company he helped manage for 53
years.
   The suit, a response to an action filed last week by Mr.
Farah, asks the court to prohibit the former head of the
apparel company from "interfering" in its daily operations.
The complaint alleges that Mr. Farah refuses to give up
control of the company and continues to "hinder" company
operations and "harass" employees. Further, the suit charges
that Mr. Farah's effort to regain control of the company is
an "ongoing scheme to avoid payment" of a $754,892 company
loan.

   As previously reported, Mr. Farah filed suit last week
against the company in an effort to prevent the board from
terminating his consulting contract and denying him access to
his office. In that action, he called the company's directors
and top officers "spiteful conspirators" who want to ruin him
financially. Mr. Farah's consulting contract pays him
$365,000 a year for the next two years.
   The management dispute began last year when Mr. Farah
resigned as president and chief executive officer. He
continued as chairman until two weeks ago, when the board
removed him after he wrote letters urging them to resign
unless they replaced current management.
   Mr. Farah wasn't available for comment yesterday.
