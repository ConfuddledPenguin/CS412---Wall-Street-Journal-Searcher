   Bayer AG, citing the weakness of the dollar and the yen
against the mark, said group pretax profit slipped 3.1% to
930 million marks ($561.6 million) in the first quarter from
960 million marks ($579.7 million) a year earlier.
   The West German chemicals company, whose first-quarter
earnings drop reflects a general trend in chemical industry
results, said sales, which were also hurt by foreign-exchange
factors, slipped 2.7% to 11.01 billion marks from 11.31
billion a year earlier. It said the strengthening of the mark
cut first-quarter sales by 550 million marks. Volume sales
rose 3% during the period.

   Bayer said the weaker first-quarter results should be seen
"against the background of the excellent first quarter of
1989." Chairman Hermann J. Strenger, speaking to reporters at
a news briefing, termed the earnings "a good start of the
1990s at a high level."
