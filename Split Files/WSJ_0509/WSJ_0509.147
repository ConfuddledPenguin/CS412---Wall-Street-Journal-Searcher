   Stuart Hall Co. is "running slightly ahead" of an earlier
projection of a 52% boost in 1990 earnings per share from
1989, Charles G. Hanson, chairman, said.
   Mr. Hanson, who also is chief executive officer of the
Kansas City, Mo., office and school-products concern, said
Stuart Hall's earnings per share are "a couple of cents
ahead" of an estimate he made at the company's annual meeting
Monday.

   At the meeting, he said he expects earnings from
continuing operations of 86 cents per share for the fiscal
year, which ends in November. Yesterday, in over-the-counter
national trading, the company's stock closed at $10.50 a
share, up from $8.875 a share on Monday.
   He said the company's gross sales for 1990 are forecast at
$127.5 million, up 28% from the year earlier's $99 million.
The company sells a range of office supply products such as
paper and envelopes, as well as school products, to
drugstores and supermarkets.
