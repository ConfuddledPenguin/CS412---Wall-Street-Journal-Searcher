   Too bad Jackie Gleason didn't live long enough to work
this one into "The Honeymooners." The Sacramento, Calif.,
Public Works Department has held a contest to rename manhole
covers. It was supposed to be just for fun and entries have
poured in from everywhere. The winner will be announced
tonight. Sacramento's mayor says the sewer department is
"keeping up with contemporary standards." Fine. We always
thought "manhole" was demeaning to men.
