   BUSH HAS DECIDED to seek a major deficit-cutting accord
with Congress, even if it means some higher taxes, senior
aides say. The president is said to remain opposed to any
rise in income-tax rates. But aides hint Bush might accept
increases in other taxes if he wins more control over
congressional spending.
   Democrats agreed they have little choice but accept Bush's
invitation to a so-called budget summit, though both
Democrats and Republicans are already wrangling over taxes.
