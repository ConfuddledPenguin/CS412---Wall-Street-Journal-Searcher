   United Parcel Service said it is replacing Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines on its older cargo jets with engines built by Rolls
Royce PLC to bring the planes within U.S. noise limits.
   UPS, based in Greenwich, Conn., said the decision will
cost it at least $400 million. It comes as a setback for
Pratt &amp; Whitney, a United Technologies Corp. division, which
is trying to sell "hushkits" to owners of hundreds of planes
powered by the company's older engines that exceed federal
and more restrictive local noise standards.

   By persuading fleet operators to install quieting
equipment rather than new engines to meet noise rules, Pratt
&amp; Whitney hopes to preserve customers for its highly
profitable spare parts business. But when air carriers opt to
re-engine the planes instead of installing the quieting gear,
Pratt &amp; Whitney risks losing the business if the customer
buys replacement engines from a competitor.
   That's what happened in UPS's decision to install
Rolls-Royce Tay 650 engines on the 35 Boeing Co. 727-100
planes in its fleet and some others it plans to acquire.
   The sale represents a further disappointment for Pratt &amp;
Whitney because the re-engining will result in London-based
Rolls-Royce replacing Pratt &amp; Whitney as a primary
engine-supplier to UPS. "It's our territory and we don't like
to see that violated," a Pratt &amp; Whitney executive in East
Hartford, Conn., said.
   UPS said the $400 million re-engine agreement includes
payments to a third party to modify the three-engine planes
for the Tay 650 and to get the reconfigured aircraft
certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. The first
of the modified planes will enter service in 1992, UPS said.
   UPS and Rolls-Royce said their agreement also includes
options for the re-engining of as many as 80 planes, should
the carrier acquire more 727s. If all of the options are
exercised, Rolls-Royce would receive about $600 million for
280 engines, including spare engines, the companies said.
   UPS said it rejected buying quieting equipment for its
727-100s because the gear -- developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney and
Memphis-based Federal Express Corp., and marketed by Federal
Express -- would only have brought the JT8D-7-engined planes
just within the latest U.S. noise standard, called stage
three. The Rolls-Royce engines, on the other hand, are just
half as noisy as the altered Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, making
the planes compliant with the more restrictive rules set by
some local airports. The new engines also burn less fuel,
spew fewer pollutants, and extend the range and payload of
the planes, UPS said. The new engines will also be cheaper to
maintain, the company said. "Looking at all the alternatives,
the Rolls-Royce choice was best for us," a UPS spokesman
said.
   Installing quieting gear would have cost UPS about $1.6
million per plane, a Federal Express spokesman said. The Tay
650 engines will cost the carrier about $6.6 million per
plane, industry executives said.
