   Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., expanded its HP
9000 family of Unix-based minicomputers with the introduction
of a new entry-level machine, the Model 822S.
   The new computer will be priced at $27,900 and is
scheduled to become available in June.

<TEXT>
   The Model 822S, like others in the 9000 family, uses
reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, technology, and
is designed to serve the client-server and laboratory
environment.
   A server is a computer within a network that offers
services to other so-called clients, including personal
computers and workstations, to free them to perform other
tasks.
   The introduction of the new model, which brings the 9000
family to 13 minicomputers, is designed to offer
"minicomputer functionality at the price of a multi-user PC,"
said Bernard Guyidon, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's
general systems division.
