   West German steel producer Hoesch AG, citing a lively
economy, successful diversification efforts and the inclusion
of new holdings, said this week that its 1989 domestic group
profit jumped 31% on a 28% gain in sales.
   Detlev Rohwedder, chairman of the Dortmund-based company,
said that the first quarter had started where the last year
left off. "The first three months of 1990 were very good, as
far as sales, profit, and order inflow are concerned," he
said. "We are quite satisfied and if the current trend
continues, we will have another delightful year."

   Hoesch, which will begin world-wide group results next
year, said domestic group profit last year reached 76 million
marks ($45.9 million), up from 58 million marks in 1988.
Sales climbed to 10.679 billion marks from 8.345 billion
marks.
   Hoesch has been boosting its financial reserves, which has
led to speculation that other companies might try to buy
Hoesch. Both British Steel PLC and Usinor Sacilor SA, a
French steel maker, have been rumored suitors. However, Mr.
Rohwedder said there have only been informal talks about
"small-scale" joint projects.
