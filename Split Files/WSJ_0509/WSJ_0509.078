   EVANSTON, Ill. -- It is always awkward for a reporter when
a source stops answering his questions, moves closer and
gently chews his ear. But allowances must be made for
eccentric geniuses.
   The biting intellect here is an African Grey parrot named
Alex, a research animal at Northwestern University. For 13
years he has fraternized only with people and now regards
them as members of his flock -- sometimes even preening the
scruffier ones about the ears. But identifying with humans
isn't what makes him special.

   Nor is his ability to whistle some Mozart and say things
like "Tickle me." Parrots, after all, are uncanny mimics. But
Alex isn't just a copycat. Asked the color of a bluish pen
held before him, he cocks his head, ponders and expounds:
"Baaloo]"
   The Prof. Henry Higgins behind this former squawker is
animal-intelligence researcher Irene Pepperberg. For 13 years
she and her assistants have tirelessly acted out a kind of
"Sesame Street" for Alex. Like Big Bird and friends, they
perform simple word skits, day after day, while he watches in
a small room stocked with toys, snacks and perches. They have
slowly drawn him into the act.
   Now he can name 80 of his favorite things, such as wool,
walnut and shower. (Studiously copying Ms. Pepperberg's
Boston accent, he says "I want showah" to get spritzed.) He
knows something about abstract ideas, including soft, hard,
same and different. He can tell how many objects there are in
groups of up to six. When he says, "Wanna cracker," he means
it: Handed a nut instead, he drops it and exclaims in his
peevish old man's voice, "I WANT CRACKER." So much for the
idea that our feathered friends are all just bird brains.
   Some other animals, such as chimpanzees, have learned
nonverbal communication. But Alex is the first animal to
actually speak with a semblance of understanding. Ms.
Pepperberg believes his conversational gambits prove that he
can handle some simple abstractions as well as chimps and
porpoises can.
   When shown a group of varied objects Alex has learned to
answer certain questions such as, "How many corners does the
piece of red paper have?" with about 80% accuracy. That is,
if he is in the mood. When bored, he tells his teachers to
"go away" and hurls test objects to the floor. "Emotionally,
parrots never go beyond the level of a three-year-old" child,
sighs Ms. Pepperberg, a young 41-year-old, patiently picking
up toys Alex has strewn about his room in an orgy of play.
   Skeptics argue that Alex isn't as smart as he seems. He
has "learned to produce a repertoire of sounds to get
rewards," says Columbia University animal cognition expert
Herbert Terrace. "The only thing distinguishing him from
pigeons {taught to peck buttons for food} is that his
responses sound like English."
   But regardless of whether Alex grasps meanings as we do,
he shows an "incredible, totally unexpected" power to make
mental connections, notes Ohio State University psychologist
Sarah Boysen, who works with chimps. Before Alex, scientists
generally dismissed talking birds as mindless mimics.
   For her part, Ms. Pepperberg sidesteps the fray, merely
noting that Alex shows "language-like" behaviors. But she
adds that parrots in the wild routinely perform mental feats
-- such as learning to sing complex duets with their mates --
that prove they have a lot on the ball. Biologists sometimes
call them "flying primates" -- they have even shown evidence
of using tools. Once when Alex couldn't lift a cup covering a
tasty nut, he turned to the nearest human assistant and
demanded crowbar style, "Go pick up cup."
   Parrots tend to go loco and pluck out their feathers when
caged alone, says Ms. Pepperberg, so they generally don't
make good pets. Yet the talking-bird trade is booming,
endangering many parrot species. Alex, whom Ms. Pepperberg
bought for $600 in a Chicago pet store in 1977, may himself
have been nabbed in the jungle. And he probably isn't an
avian Einstein -- he is just highly schooled. "It's possible
I got a dingbat," his coach says.
   If so, he proves how much inspired teaching can do for the
dingy. Ms. Pepperberg, who took up bird research while
getting her chemistry doctorate at Harvard University, has
helped pioneer a new training strategy for animals that
stresses human-like learning by social interaction. "There's
been a lot of resistance to my work," she says, "because I
don't use standard techniques." But not from Alex.
   Standing on a chair, he is all eyes and ears as she and an
assistant hand back and forth a date nearby -- they're trying
to add it to his lexicon. "I like date," says Ms. Pepperberg.
"Give me date. Yum." Suddenly Alex ventures, "Wanna grain."
"No," says Ms. Pepperberg, "date. Do you want date?" Alex
preens, seemingly mulling it over. Then he says, "I want
grape." That's good enough for now. She hands it to him and
he takes a bite.
   Another of her tricks resembles the way parents help tug
their toddlers into verbal being -- by acting as if babbling
is meaningful. When Alex says something new, Ms. Pepperberg
tries to "map" it to something he is likely to remember.
After he learned "rock" and "corn," and spontaneously said,
"rock corn," she got dried corn and began using that term for
it. Similarly, "peg wood" was mapped to clothespin and
"carrot nut" to the candy Boston Baked Beans. Alex no longer
gets candy, though, for it makes him hyperactively "bounce
off the walls, saying `I want this, I want that,'" says Ms.
Pepperberg.
   Alex often seems to play with words like kids learning to
talk. Overnight tape recordings revealed he privately babbles
to himself, perhaps practicing new words. Once he saw himself
in a mirror and asked, "What color?" -- that's how "gray" was
mapped. When a student blocked him from climbing on her
chair, he uttered the only curse he's heard: "You turkey]"
   These untrained signs of wit may be just "babble luck,"
says Ms. Pepperberg. Still, Alex sometimes seems to be
groping for linguistic connections. Soon after first seeing
apples, he called one a "banerry" -- a word he hadn't heard.
"No," Ms. Pepperberg gently reminded him, "apple." Alex
persisted: "Banerry," he said, "ban-err-eeee" -- speaking as
his teachers do with new words. He still uses banerry, says
Ms. Pepperberg, which after all makes sense: An apple tastes
a little like a banana and looks like a big cherry, fruits he
already knew.
   Today, the gray eminence is again doing it his way. When
Ms. Pepperberg holds up two keys and repeatedly asks, "How
many?" he plays dumb. Finally, she calls a "time out,"
leaving the room. Moments later, Alex looks at me, eyes the
keys, and spits out, "Two."
