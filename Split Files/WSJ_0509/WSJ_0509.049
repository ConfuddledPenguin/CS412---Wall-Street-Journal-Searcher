   In the first line of the March 28 Leisure &amp; Arts piece
"Dark Days for Duck," author Michael Pearce says, "I had
stood alone on the levy . . ."
   May I offer the following correction. Levy: the imposition
or collection of an assessment. Levee: an embankment for
preventing flooding.

   When in doubt, remember the lines from that old song,
"Waitin' on the levee, Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee."
