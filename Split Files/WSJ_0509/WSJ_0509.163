   The workstation is about to become cheaper and portable as
well, continuing its penetration of the personal-computer
market.
   Sun Microsystems Inc., of Mountain View, Calif., is
expected to unveil on Tuesday a new low-cost version of its
popular Sparcstation that puts it in the price range of many
personal computers. And Tokyo's Toshiba Corp., in a bid to
expand its share of the rapidly growing market for
workstations, said it would begin selling the world's first
portable workstation.

   Sun's machine, expected to cost just under $5,000, is just
the latest in a technological leapfrogging game by computer
makers; rivals say they will soon best Sun's machine with
still faster, cheaper workstations.
   Toshiba's announcement comes a month after Japanese rival
Sony Corp. announced it would sell a portable workstation by
late July. Toshiba said it hopes to begin production of its
new machine, based on Sun's Sparc chip, in the U.S. by the
end of the year, officials said at a Tokyo news conference.
It is scheduled to go on sale in Japan in mid-July.
   Called the Sparc LT model, it is the latest demonstration
of Toshiba's ability to pack more and more computing power
into smaller and smaller machines. The company, long a minor
player in computer sales, has become a world leader in laptop
personal computers in the past three years. The new
workstation "is going to extend the market because you're
going to be able to do more things with it," said Peter G.
Wolff, a technology analyst with Kidder Peabody's Tokyo
office. "It's an innovative step."
   But many computer makers say the market for laptop
workstations is limited. Since the main users of workstations
are scientists and engineers, who typically work with
equipment that isn't readily movable, the advantages of
portability aren't as clear-cut as they are for
personal-computer users.
   In addition, workstations usually gain much of their
usefulness from being hooked up to one another and to other
computers. As a result, users aren't very likely to use them
at home or on the road, as many business executives do with
portable personal computers.
   Workstations, which combine high speed with flashy
graphics and usually run the Unix operating system, until
recently have been high-priced desktop machines selling for
$20,000 and up. But prices have fallen steeply since last
year as makers worked toward the high end of the
personal-computer market.
   "The technology wars are really heating up and the
technology price curve is getting steeper," said John Hime,
vice president of systems products marketing at MIPS Computer
Systems Inc. "Sun's got a great machine, but other companies
like MIPS are introducing technology just as fast, if not
faster."
   The new Sun machine, called the Sparcstation SLC, will run
at 12.5 million operations per second, analysts familiar with
the machine say. The $5,000 price tag brings the computer
well into the price range of high-end personal computers,
which don't run as fast and have poorer graphics. Sun's
cheapest machine now is the $8,995 Sparcstation 1-Plus.
   Still, the Sun machine may lack important components. The
SLC will be a stripped-down version of Sun's Sparcstation
built into a 17-inch monochrome monitor with no disk drive
and no ability to be expanded with add-in cards. So it will
have to be tied into a network of other computers to be
useful.
   What's more, any low-priced workstation faces a basic
hurdle: Most of the software programs that businesses use are
written to run on Microsoft Corp.'s MSDOS operating system,
not on the Unix operating system used by Sun.
   Sun's rivals are critical of the new product. "I don't
think they'll have the performance in the box to make up for
all the things the box doesn't have," said Donald Gaubatz,
group manager for workstations at Digital Equipment Corp.
Digital began selling last year a $5,950 workstation that is
only slightly slower than the Sparcstation, he said, adding
that the company plans to keep the price competitively low.
   MIPS, likewise, said it plans price cuts and performance
improvements that will bring its machines in line with Sun's
by this summer. Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to sell later this
year a low-end workstation based on Motorola Inc.'s new 68040
microprocessor chip. Hewlett now has the cheapest
workstation, the $3,990 DN 2500, running at about 40% the
speed of the new Sun machine, said Mark Tolliver, Hewlett's
workstation-marketing manager. "We have no intention of
surrendering that position," he said.
   The new Toshiba machine, which weighs 17.7 pounds, has a
fold-up screen. Company officials said it weighs a third as
much as the basic Sun model sold in Japan, and takes up half
the space. It has a processing speed of 13.2 mips and will
sell in Japan for about two million yen (about $12,600).
Toshiba expects to sell about 3,000 of the machines in Japan
this year and about 14,000 next year.
   But, in addition to concerns about the practicality of a
laptop workstation, the Sparc LT has some technological
constraints that may limit its use. It currently has only a
built-in black and white screen. Color, often a crucial
feature for the scientists and engineers who are the main
workstation users, won't be available for more than two
years. Unlike battery-operable laptop computers, the machine
has to be plugged in.
   Toshiba's market projections for laptops are "rubbish,"
said Vicky Brown of International Data Corp. of Framington,
Mass. "Can you see someone carrying 18 pounds on the bullet
train? We're far away from the point where we're going to
have a big market for laptop workstations."
   Digital's Mr. Gaubatz agrees. Users of Unix workstations
depend heavily on networks that tie them together with other
machines, he said. "There will be some people who would find
a reason to buy it," he said. But most users "are just too
intimately connected to their network. You don't have that if
you have the thing on your lap."
   But Toshiba officials say that, with desk space more
cramped in Japan than in the U.S., such smaller machines may
have greater appeal in their home market. And they say they
are simplifying the software to try and broaden the base of
traditional workstation users.
   Toshiba has been selling Sun workstations in Japan since
1986, and a year ago signed an agreement with Sun allowing it
to develop and manufacture machines based on the Sun system.
"Sun welcomes the Sparc LT," said Scott McNealy, Sun's
chairman, in a statement videotaped for yesterday's press
conference. "This complementary product will expand the
market for Sparc workstations and servers, just as the PC
market was enhanced by the arrival of laptops."
   The Japanese, who still have only a tiny share of the
world computer market, have been jumping into the $6 billion
workstation market. Sony is Japan's leader with its News
workstation, which it started selling in 1987, and exporting
the following year.
