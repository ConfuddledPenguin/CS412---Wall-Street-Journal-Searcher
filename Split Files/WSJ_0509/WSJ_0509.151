   TORRANCE, Calif. -- American Republic Bancorp said it
named two shareholders, who are also directors of its
Republic Bank unit, to the board of the parent company,
expanding it to nine members.
   "The action was taken to avoid the possibility of a
contest over the election of directors" at the annual
shareholders meeting, originally set for tomorrow but
postponed until revised proxy materials are ready, the
company said.

   The new directors are Edmond J. Russ, an attorney and
former mayor of Gardena, Calif., and Henry Zdonek, a
certified public accountant. Mr. Russ said in an interview
that he nominated Mr. Zdonek in a letter sent to American
Republic's president last month.
   "It wasn't a proxy fight; any shareholder can nominate
someone to the board," Mr. Russ said.
   The two men hope to generate more local business for the
bank in their new positions. "There might {also} have been
some differences with the board," but "they weren't major
enough to be publicly announced," Mr. Russ said.
