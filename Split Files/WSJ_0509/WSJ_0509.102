   NEW YORK -- J. Richard Walton, president of Morgan
Grenfell Capital Management Inc., the U.S. money management
unit of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, resigned yesterday along
with four other people.
   Morgan Grenfell, a wholly owned unit of Deutsche Bank AG,
named James E. Minnick, executive vice president in charge of
marketing and sales, to replace Mr. Walton as president.

   Mr. Walton said he was leaving because of his desire along
with others to form "my own firm or something that's part of
another firm where we own the majority of the equity in our
unit." He said that within the last two months he had been
approached "by five to 10 people" who either asked him to
join them or who were willing to back a new venture.
   Mr. Walton said that the other four people who resigned
were all part of the unit he initially set up in December
1985. He said that some of them could join him in his next
job.
   Both Mr. Walton and Morgan Grenfell said that the
departure was friendly. Nonetheless, Morgan Grenfell's
London-based asset management operation has been wracked with
difficulties, including the departure of some key portfolio
managers, employee dissatisfaction with management and
deteriorating performance.
   Three weeks ago, Keith Percy, who resigned as chairman of
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, was named the chief
executive officer of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management PLC,
which manages about $25 billion. Phillips &amp; Drew is a unit of
Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Last November, Deutsche Bank paid about #900 million
($1.41 billion at the time) for the 95.1% of Morgan Grenfell
Group PLC it didn't already own. The friendly takeover was
the world's largest acquisition of an investment bank.
   Mr. Walton said his resignation was unrelated to the
Deutsche Bank acquisition. Still, investment bankers noted
the big risks in purchasing a merchant bank like Morgan
Grenfell where the assets are mostly people who can literally
walk out the door. To avoid that, the West German bank
reportedly offered a few key portfolio managers three-year
contracts, according to money managers in London.
   Under Mr. Walton, the U.S. Morgan Grenfell unit grew to
where it currently manages $2.3 billion of clients' funds,
investing in U.S. securities mostly for American
institutional investors and a few international clients.
   Mr. Walton "is an exceptional individual and has all the
talents any organization would want," said Mario Gabelli,
chairman and chief investment officer of the Gabelli Group
Inc., a New York money management firm.
