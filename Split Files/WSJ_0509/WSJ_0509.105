   Angeles Corp. said it expects to report a $3.9 million net
loss for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, mainly
because of the company's withdrawal from certain real estate
investment programs.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the Los Angeles investment
management concern earned 723,000, or 16 cents a share, on
revenue of $9.9 million.

   Angeles said it will no longer offer real estate limited
partnerships or real estate investment trusts to individual
investors because the vehicles have fallen out of public
favor. The decision will result in the elimination of roughly
50 jobs "at every level," possibly including some corporate
officers, a spokesman said. The staff reductions and related
moves will result in annual savings of about $2.5 million, he
said.
