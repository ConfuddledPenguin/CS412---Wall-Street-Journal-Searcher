   NEW YORK -- Two fledgling cable-radio services said they
will combine in a joint venture that will offer free music
programming to about 10 million cable-TV subscribers by late
summer.
   International Cablecasting Technologies Inc., which now
delivers its Tempo Sound music service to fewer than one
million homes and had expected to be serving five million
households soon, will form the joint venture with a
subsidiary of Jones International Ltd., a cable operator.

   Jones International's service, Galactic Radio Partners
Inc., now delivers radio programming to about 3.5 million
households. Combining the two services, which use cable-TV
receivers to deliver static-free music by wires plugged into
the stereos of cable subscribers, will enable the two
partners to reach a "critical mass" needed to attract
advertising, said Tom Oliver, president and chief executive
officer of International Cablecasting.
   "Starting with a base of 10 million is the opening play
for a cable network," in television or radio, Mr. Oliver
said. The new venture will run about half the load of
commercials commonly found on regular over-the-air radio
stations, which typically run 10 to 12 minutes of advertising
each hour, he said.
   The joint service, owned 50-50 by the two partners, will
offer nine channels of 24-hour-a-day FM stereo music via
cable systems, which will be charged a small fee of three
cents a month for each cable household.
   While the cable-radio signal will be more clear than
regular FM reception, it won't offer the digital-audio
quality of a second service which International Cablecasting
aims to start next fall. That service, known as CD-30 and
commercial-free, will charge cable television subscribers
about $8 a month to receive 30 channels of all-digital music,
recorded on compact discs and delivered to homes via a
special tuner that will be made by Scientific-Atlanta Inc.
   International Cablecasting, whose shares are traded on the
Vancouver stock exchange, is based in Berverly Hills, Calif.
Jones International is based in Englewood, Colo.
