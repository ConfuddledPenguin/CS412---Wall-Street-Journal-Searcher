   CHICAGO -- Stone Container Corp. said it successfully
tested a paper bag product containing 20% old newsprint.
   The company, a supplier of recycled newsprint, said it
completed full-scale production testing in the past 10 days
at a Jacksonville, Fla., plant. Production plans call for
recycling 60 million pounds of old newspapers for use in the
bag.
