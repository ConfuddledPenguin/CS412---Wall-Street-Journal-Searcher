   TEL AVIV -- At 5 Luntz St., it's business as usual for
Yair Klein, wanted in Colombia on charges of running a
training school for cocaine-cartel hitmen and facing
prosecution at home for breaking Israeli law on exporting
defense know-how.
   In the nine months since this situation surfaced, Mr.
Klein has continued to run what he brags is "the best team in
Israel for small wars, anti-terror units and commando
operations." An official inquiry in Israel hasn't led to a
prosecution, and now new evidence implicates him in the sale
of weapons discovered at the ranch of one of Colombia's most
infamous drug barons.

   How does Mr. Klein, a swashbuckling lieutenant-colonel in
the Israeli army reserves, manage to keep operating? Mr.
Klein is part of a world-wide trade in military arms and
expertise that brings Israel big money, along with
innumerable scandals. The nation needs international sales to
prop up its arms industry, and prosecuting him could open a
window that Israel prefers to keep shut. Israel has shown
willingness to do business with just about any government,
and tolerance of shadowy dealers such as Mr. Klein.
   A powerfully built veteran of the Lebanon war, the
46-year-old Mr. Klein says the Colombians he trained were
ranchers rather than drug lords, and he denies selling any
arms to cocaine dealers.
   Arms are big business in Israel. At least one out of every
10 workers is involved in the arms trade, from
cottage-industry consultancies such as Mr. Klein's, operated
out of a seedy Tel Aviv apartment, to industrial giants such
as Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd., the state's largest
exporter, whose foreign military sales last year exceeded
$800 million.
   According to official figures, military sales to more than
60 countries brought Israel $1.4 billion last year, putting
the tiny nation of 4.4 million people among the world's
largest arms exporters. And those figures don't include rogue
operations such as Mr. Klein's training school, which wasn't
approved by the Ministry of Defense. Some 40% of Israel's
sales go to the U.S. and Europe. But even a partial list of
other past and current clients reveals the bizarre nature and
the global reach of Israel's arms trade.
   Murky dealings in Latin America long predate Mr. Klein's
adventures. Israel has supplied arms and training to the
military juntas of Chile, Guatemala and Argentina. It aided
Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza until his fall, then aided the
Contra rebels. A top adviser to Panama's Manuel Noriega,
Michael Harari, was former head of clandestine operations for
Mossad, Israel's intelligence service.
   In Africa, Israel recently re-established military links
with Ethiopia's Marxist president, Mengistu Haile Miriam.
Israeli military advisers helped Idi Amin to power in Uganda
in 1971. Zaire's dictator, Mobuto Sese Seko, trained as a
paratrooper in Israel, had an ex-Mossad agent as a top
adviser, and currently is host to eight Israeli officers as
trainers for his army. Despite international sanctions,
Israel has conducted many joint military programs with South
Africa, perhaps even collaborating on nuclear arms.
   The late Ayatollah Khomeini got Israeli arms at least
until 1985. And a 1988 prosecution of an Israeli middle man
in Hong Kong finally exposed the details of a long-denied
arms-supply relationship with China.
   A few Israelis deplore their state's links with such
regimes. "What enemy is Israel fighting through these sales?"
asks Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, a professor of psychology and a
specialist in the arms trade at Haifa University. In most
cases, he says, "it is the population of the Third World,
which can't be allowed to win its revolution." Israelis, he
argues, tend to identify leftist guerrilla movements with the
struggle of the Palestinians. "The confrontation doesn't
start in Zaire, it starts right here. When Israelis look at
the people of the Third World, they see the Arabs of Gaza."
   But few Israelis share Mr. Beit-Hallahmi's views. Hard
economics drives the arms business, says David Ivry,
director-general of the Israeli Defense Ministry. "Foreign
policy is one reason to approve a contract, but no one is
even asking permission if it isn't economically wise." There
is, however, a strong correlation between arms clients and
regimes that have large or vulnerable Jewish communities,
such as Ethiopia, Chile, Argentina, Morocco and South Africa.
   Surrounded by enemies, Israel has always needed arms. An
early embargo by Britain, France and the U.S. forced the tiny
state to produce its own. For it to make the industry
economically viable, exports became essential. And as the
Israeli forces attained remarkable victories, the demand for
their battle-tested equipment soared.
   Now, with the easing of tensions everywhere from NATO to
Soweto, the industry is threatened with the loss of its
biggest clients and competition from a flood of low-priced
surplus.
   Yet with enemies such as Iraq continuing to expand their
arsenals, Israel can't afford to significantly reduce its own
production, and must somehow find new markets.
   Israel isn't alone in supplying arms to unsavory regimes.
Just last month, France delivered Mirage jets to Libya's Col.
Moammar Gadhafi in return for hostages. The Swiss sold
military planes to Idi Amin in 1977, and the Iran-Contra
scandal showed that the U.S. wasn't above dealing even with
its arch-foe for a perceived political gain.
   Israeli weapons sales occasionally have been undertaken as
U.S. dirty work, to funnel military aid to domestically
unpalatable regimes, but others fly in the face of U.S.
foreign policy. As a result, the Israelis "tend to be
close-handed about their deals," says a U.S. Defense
Department official who works closely with the Israelis.
Because the U.S. is the source of much of Israel's most
sophisticated weapons technology, it theoretically controls
its re-export. "We can put a lot of pressure on them," says
the official, "but Israel isn't a parrot."
   In Ethiopia, Mr. Mengistu's brutal regime is tottering,
with insurrections by its starving people flaring in several
regions. Signs are that the Soviets, long the main arms
supplier, are withdrawing support, but Israel is stepping
into the breach. In December, aid workers say, teams of
Israelis were flying daily from Addis Ababa to the airport in
Asmara, an Ethiopian base of operations against Eritrean
guerrillas.
   The Israeli government denies sending any military
instructors. "We are sending almost nothing to Ethiopia -- a
very low amount of assistance," says a senior Israeli
government official.
   Israel wants freedom of emigration for the estimated
17,000 Jews in Ethiopia, and several hundred have arrived in
Israel since diplomatic ties resumed last year after a
16-year break. As well, Ethiopia has pardoned Jews sentenced
to prison for trying to emigrate illegally.
   "Whatever we did with Ethiopia lately was to get out those
Jews," says Benjamin Peled, former head of the Israeli air
force. Even if Mr. Mengistu falls, Israel still can benefit,
Mr. Peled argues, because relationships formed among the
military endure from regime to regime. "Down at working
levels in those countries there probably is sympathy, because
the people we sent are good people," he says.
   Like many retired Israeli officers, Mr. Peled, a
major-general in the reserves, last year founded his own
company, Crossbow Ltd., to develop and market arms. A
confidential private-placement memorandum details the
company's aim to produce products "for use by military and
paramilitary combat units at the low tactical echelons," or,
as Mr. Peled puts it, to get some of the "glitter" of
high-tech weaponry into the hands of ordinary fighters.
   Mr. Peled's decision to turn his distinguished military
career to use in business isn't unusual in Israel, where army
service is universal. "You take a guy who grows up on a farm
and goes into the army," says Aharon Klieman, a professor of
politics at Tel Aviv University. "When he comes out, he knows
two things, how to grow tomatoes and how to make war. And
there's a lot more money in war."
   Israel has an estimated 100,000 reserve officers and some
800 licensed military consultancies. Many of them advertise
their skills in a weighty tome titled "Israel Defense Sales
Directory," issued annually by the Defense Ministry's
arms-sales office. Some of the hardware advertised in its
glossy, full-color pages: a "low-cost terminal guidance kit
for general-purpose bombs"; "an ear in the right place" bugs
for telephone, telex and computer monitoring; and "the unique
High-tech riot control vehicles" with "colored tear gas jet."
   There also are ads for consultancies such as Iscal Group,
which features a photograph of eight unnamed men with a
caption bragging that "each of these executives has an
impressive personal CV in certain military fields of
activity," and offering their services to help develop ground
and air forces.
   Yair Klein's firm, Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead, advertised
in the Spanish-language edition of the directory in 1988, a
year before Mr. Klein was accused of training Colombian drug
warriors.
   Hod Hahanit was established in 1983. Mr. Klein had served
12 years in the army and, as a reservist, fought as a deputy
brigade commander in the Lebanon war. His company's first
client was a contact from that conflict, the Phalange
Christian militia, the group responsible for the massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps. The
Phalange wanted "belts, helmets, personal gear," Mr. Klein
says, and he arranged for their supply.
   Between that contract and the Colombia training job, Mr.
Klein says he worked for about 100 international clients. Mr.
Klein, with a deep tan and a dazzling smile, says much of the
work was driven by his own personal crusade against the
spread of communism in the Third World. "Today's left isn't
the same left," he says, "but two or three years ago, leftist
guerrillas were a source of evil in the world."
   Mr. Klein said in an April interview that he initially
applied to the Israel Ministry of Defense for a permit to
train members of a Colombian government security agency. That
permit was denied. He says that when ranchers approached him
soon after, worried about guerrilla attacks and seeking
anti-insurgent training, he didn't ask the Defense Ministry's
permission. Technically, Israel requires consultants to
obtain a permit even to begin negotiations on a military
deal. But "in practice," Mr. Klein said, such rules weren't
observed. "Many people were working with private bodies"
without official sanction, he says.
   The first scandal broke last August, when NBC aired a film
of Mr. Klein conducting one of his classes. Mr. Klein
acknowledges that some of the ranchers he trained may have
been involved in the drug trade, but he says he didn't have
any knowledge of it. "Anyone who deals with drugs should be
executed," he says.
   Last December, however, Colombian police ambushed and
killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a major drug trafficker.
A search of his ranch found a cache of arms which was traced
to an Israeli shipment that supposedly had been destined for
Antigua. Baruch Binah, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign
Ministry, says Israel approved a shipment of Uzis and other
light arms to the small security force of the eastern
Carribbean island with the stipulation that it wouldn't be
passed on to any other nation. Antiguan officials have told
the Israelis they didn't order the arms and have launched an
inquiry into how the shipment ordered in their name passed to
Colombia.
   Mr. Klein, named by Antiguans as an intermediary in the
newly disclosed deal, has denied he sold anything to Mr.
Gacha. A report in the Jerusalem Post quotes Mr. Klein as
saying he arranged the arms for Panamanian insurgents who
wanted to topple Gen. Noriega. Mr. Klein couldn't be
contacted for comment on that report, and his lawyer, Yigal
Shapira, wouldn't elaborate, saying that "it isn't the time
to tell the full story."
   The Israeli government says it still is investigating Mr.
Klein's Colombian activities. But that hasn't stopped him
from getting lucrative contracts to provide anti-terrorist
training to bus drivers of "the Egged," a cooperative
subsidized and regulated by the government, and to railway
workers. Mr. Klein says he also was employed to train
security officers of the Interior Ministry, although a
spokeswoman for the ministry couldn't immediately confirm
this.
   Mr. Klein says he prefers to work abroad "because the
money is better, and clients are willing to listen." He adds,
"In Israel everybody thinks they know better than you." But
now, he says, "because of all the noise" over Colombia, he is
working only in Israel. He even has diversified from the
security field into a new business -- supplying Jordan River
water in crucifix-shaped bottles to Christian tourists. His
business card for that enterprise bears the name Yair Gal.
   Why his case remains unresolved was hinted at by Rafael
Eitan, a member of the Israeli parliament and a former army
chief of staff.
   "Someday, perhaps, if it's decided that the stories can be
told, you'll see that the state has been involved in acts
which are a thousand times more dirty than anything going on
in Colombia," he told the Jerusalem Post last September.
"These things were decided by the government, in cabinet
meetings. As long as the government decides to do something,
something that the national interest demanded, then it is
legitimate."
