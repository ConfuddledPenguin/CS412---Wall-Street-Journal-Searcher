   NEW YORK -- J. Richard Munro, presiding over the first and
sometimes contentious annual shareholders meeting of the
merged Time Warner Inc., stepped down as co-chairman and
co-chief executive officer, as expected.
   Mr. Munro announced his move at the start of the long
meeting in which many shareholders expressed support for Time
Inc.'s debt-laden $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc., while a few others sternly criticized
it.

   The level of discontent -- stemming from Time Warner's
$10.8 billion debt load, its more than $400 million in losses
for the past two quarters, and a stock price that has plunged
to half of its 52-week peak -- showed up in surprisingly
large shareholder votes against measures involving executive
stock plans.
   Some 25% of the shares that were voted weighed in against
the proposed 1989 stock incentive plan, which passed
nonetheless with a 70% vote in its favor. In voting on
changes to a restricted stock plan for outside directors,
just over 21% of the ballots cast were against the plan,
which won approval with 75% in favor.
   "That's surprising. That's great," said Nell Minow,
general counsel of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.,
which advises institutional holders in proxy matters. "I
haven't seen that level of opposition to a stock plan before.
It shows shareholders are wising up."
   In addition, 43% of the shares that were voted for the
annual meeting were registered in favor of a proposal that
Time Warner had urged holders to vote against. The proposal
would have rescinded a "poison pill" plan that makes Time
Warner a tougher takeover target or would have required
shareholder approval of the plan.
   "I think it's because of the bad break" in the stock
price, said Steven J. Ross in explaining the 43% vote in
favor of the poison-pill measure that Time Warner had
opposed. Mr. Ross, the longtime chairman of Warner
Communications, now reigns as the merged company's sole
chairman and its co-chief executive officer.
   But Ms. Minow of Institutional Shareholder Services said
many institutional investors vote in favor of outside
proposals for putting "poison pills" up for shareholder
approval, regardless of the company involved.
   Time Warner executives had come under fire for reaping
millions in personal profits on the merger even as the price
of Time Inc. stock, which was driven to as high as $182.75 by
what Time contended was a bogus takeover offer by Paramount
Communications Inc., fell to the $90-plus range.
   But Mr. Ross blames the loss of more than $2.5 billion in
the company's market value on the specter of re-regulation of
local cable systems now gaining sway in Washington. Cable
systems are Time Warner's "single biggest asset today," he
said after the meeting. Once the cable industry makes its
case against regulation, "I think that cloud will pass," Mr.
Ross said.
   Mr. Munro, 59 years old, becomes chairman of the board's
executive committee and remains on the company payroll. He
had joined Time Inc. in 1957, rising to publisher of Sports
Illustrated and then moving through corporate posts to become
chief executive in 1980 and chairman in 1986.
   His co-chief executive title will be assumed today by
Nicholas J. Nicholas, Mr. Munro's longtime No. 2 at Time Inc.
and the president of the merged concern. Mr. Nicholas, age
50, remains president and will share chief executive duties
with Mr. Ross until the latter steps aside in mid-1994.
