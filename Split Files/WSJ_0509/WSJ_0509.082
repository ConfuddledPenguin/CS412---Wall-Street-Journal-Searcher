   Health-care experts have long complained that the U.S.
doesn't get its money's worth for its high medical costs, but
proof has been elusive.
   Now, researchers comparing hospital care in Canada and the
U.S. have found little difference in death rates for a
variety of surgical procedures in the two countries, despite
wide differences in cost.

   "The U.S. is spending a lot more on hospitals than we are,
but they don't seem to be getting as much out of it," says
Leslie L. Roos, professor of community health sciences at the
University of Manitoba, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the lead
author of the study. The U.S. spends 25% to 50% more per
capita for hospital care than Canada does.
   The study, published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, is among the first to base such a
finding on data covering a broad range of procedures. It
doesn't suggest how the U.S. might reduce health costs and,
among other limitations, it looks only at death rates in
judging the results of care. But its favorable conclusion
regarding Canadian health-care is particularly interesting
because the system is considered an important model by those
who advocate overhaul of the U.S. system.
   The researchers compared death rates both 30 days and six
months after surgery on patients aged 65 and over who
underwent one of 11 different procedures in New England
hospitals and hospitals in Manitoba. The study covered 18,945
operations performed in Manitoba between 1980 and 1986 and
64,300 procedures at New England institutions in 1984 and
1985.
   "We found absolutely no difference (in mortality) for
low-risk and moderate-risk procedures" after 30 days, says
Elliott Fisher, assistant professor of medicine at Dartmouth
Medical School, Hanover, N.H., and a co-author of the report.
These included gallbladder and prostate surgery, coronary
bypass surgery and hip replacement.
   However, U.S. hospitals had significantly lower death
rates in two procedures considered high-risk: hip fracture
repair, and open heart surgery in which doctors do both
coronary bypass and heart valve replacement. Manitoba
residents with fractured hips were 40% more likely to die
within 30 days of surgery than those in New England.
   The researchers speculate that the higher Manitoba death
rates for hip fracture occurred because more patients are
transferred from rural facilities before surgery -- 24% in
Manitoba compared with 5% in New England -- and because they
are more likely to be operated on at hospitals that do a low
volume of hip fracture repairs.
   Death rates are just one measure of hospital quality.
"You're paying to keep mortality rates low in health care,"
Dr. Fisher notes. "But it's only one of the end points."
Further study is necessary to determine, for instance,
whether U.S. patients feel better or function better than
Canadians 30 days after surgery, or if they spend fewer days
in nursing homes. If the additional hospital cost buys such
improvement in quality of life, he suggests, it could be
worth the price.
   Mr. Roos speculates death rates in Canada were aided by
strong post-surgical care, including longer hospital stays
than in the U.S., and by a well-developed and funded
home-care system. Patients are evaluated in the hospital to
determine what care they need at home, and they get it, he
says.
   Death rates at six months after surgery for the low- and
moderate-risk procedures favored Manitoba, the researchers
said, a finding that probably reflects more the underlying
health of the population than the quality of hospital care.
The researchers also found evidence that Manitoba residents
are healthier overall than those in New England. Death rates
for men and women at ages 65, 75 and 85 favored Manitobans by
from 2% to 19%. If Canadians are healthier, Mr. Roos asks,
"How come? Do we have less stress, eat better or exercise
more?"
   Such data, he says, suggest that policy makers concerned
with health costs should look beyond the issue of "shoving
money at the acute-care system" to what leads to better
health in the population at large.
