   Sales of the top 100 black-owned industrial and service
companies fell 3.8% in 1989, according to the annual ranking
by Black Enterprise magazine.
   The list continued to be dominated by TLC Beatrice
International Holdings Inc., formed as the result of a 1987
leveraged buy-out by entrepreneur Reginald Lewis. TLC's 1989
sales fell 23% to $1.51 billion after the company sold some
of its operations. But TLC still had 35% of the total revenue
of the 100 concerns.

   The 18th annual list, featured in the June issue of the
black-business magazine, has become the annual yardstick for
measuring and ranking black business, despite the fact that
it uses self-reported sales figures and doesn't estimate
profits. Only one concern on the list, Johnson Products Co.,
Chicago, is publicly traded. It was ranked 24th on the list.
   "If it's privately held it becomes a little tricky as to
how profitable they were," said Black Enterprise Publisher
Earl G. Graves. "There's a tendency in the black {business}
community to want to stay fairly close to your chest about
what you're doing and how you do it."
   Mr. Graves said the companies had setbacks in profits and
sales because of a sluggish economy, especially in the
construction field. Some companies dependent on government
contracts have been hurt by the slowdown in defense spending
and the pall cast over government set-aside programs for
minorities, which have been threatened by recent court
decisions.
   J. Bruce Llewellyn, who owns Philadelphia Coca-Cola
Bottling Co., No. 3 on the list, and Queen City Broadcasting
Inc., No. 34, said the list proves there is a growing cadre
of black businesses that couldn't have been assembled 20
years ago. But he added that he was skeptical of the some of
figures, because the annual ranking is the object of
competition among some black-business leaders.
   Mr. Llewellyn said he was surprised that another of his
firms, Garden State Cable, wasn't on the list. With sales of
$70 million, Garden State would be No. 8 on the list, but a
Black Enterprise spokesman said according to the magazine's
research it isn't 51% black-owned. Mr. Llewellyn said the
Federal Communications Commission certified Garden State's
minority status when he purchased it from New York Times Co.
last year.
   Mr. Graves said that increasingly this list (a separate
list is compiled for the biggest black car dealers) includes
companies that have expanded in a short time through
acquisitions. Eight of the top 20 companies were founded
since 1980. Mr. Graves, whose own Earl G. Graves Ltd. slipped
to number 50 from number 34 on the list this year, said his
company expected to close on a substantial acquisition -- the
first such move in its 20 year history -- within the next
month that could raise its standing.
   W. Don Cornwell, 41, president of Granite Broadcasting
Corp., New York, began by purchasing four network-affiliated
television stations in late 1988. The firm made its debut at
No. 18 on the list this year. The former Goldman Sachs
investment banker noted there are two distinct types of firms
on the list, classic entrepreneurial startups and takeover
situations.
   "There are people like Bruce Llewellyn and myself who
through astute financial dealings have acquired fairly mature
and established businesses," he said.
   While the debt market has soured on supporting leveraged
buy-out activities, Mr. Cornwell said he expects to see more
black businesses built by acquisition on the Black Enterprise
list in years to come.
   Despite the overall flat sales, the minimum sales figure
required to make the list rose to $7.2 million from $5.5
million a year ago. When the list began in 1972 it was $1
million. "When you start looking at where we are, the
progress we've made is not insignificant, given what we've
had to overcome," Mr. Graves said.
