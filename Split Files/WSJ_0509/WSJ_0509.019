   Bad real estate loans may be a mounting problem for many
of the nation's banks, and fears of a worsening credit crunch
may be growing, but banks are still chasing home-equity
loans.
   Indeed, even in markets such as New York and New England,
where real estate prices are soft, affluent borrowers with
solid credit records are still in big demand.

   "We want to do more, not less" home-equity lending, says
Alec Smythe, marketing director for consumer-banking products
at Citibank, which has $3.8 billion of home-equity credit
outstanding. "Both in terms of advertising and pricing, we're
tending to be more competitive."
   True, some home-equity lenders are becoming more selective
-- paying greater and greater attention to borrowers' credit
histories, tightening loan-to-value and debt-service ratios
and becoming more stringent in their real-estate appraisals.
   But lenders are competing as hotly as ever for borrowers
who qualify. Many are waiving up-front "points" and other
fees that borrowers usually pay to close home-equity credits.
In some markets, Citibank and others are offering to lend as
much as 100% of a home's equity value (the market value minus
the existing mortgage debt outstanding) for upscale borrowers
willing to pay a higher interest rate.
   Says Kenneth Wohst, senior vice president in charge of
consumer loans at Chemical Bank: "Our strategy is that
{home-equity loans} are the featured way to borrow and the
linchpin of our consumer loan products going forward."
   Home-equity credits come in two basic flavors: loans and
credit lines. The loans -- which are a lot like normal
mortgages, with regular monthly paydowns of interest and
principal -- tend to appeal to the most conservative
borrowers. The lines are revolving credit arrangements that
charge interest only on amounts drawn down, making them more
like credit-card debt.
   Interest on home-equity lines is variable, usually
floating at 1.5 to 2 percentage points over the prime rate,
with monthly or quarterly adjustments. But the pricing is
becoming increasingly competitive. For instance, a Federal
Reserve survey of major banks' pricing on such lines in
February showed that more than 8% had trimmed the average
"spread" over their base rates since last autumn, while only
4% said they had raised it.
   "The pricing has clearly moved down since these products
started out, and my judgment is that the price will continue
to drop somewhat," says Walter Blass, chairman of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Mortgage Corp. Shearson offers home-equity
lines priced at the prime rate, but with a stiff 2.5
percentage points of origination fees up front to initiate
the line.
   Banks like home-equity lending because the credits are
collateralized by people's homes, providing greater security
and lower default rates than other types of consumer loans.
Numerous market surveys also show that home-equity credit
tends to appeal to the kind of upscale, educated consumers
that banks favor most.
   Borrowers like home-equity credit for the tax advantages:
Interest paid on as much as $100,000 of home-equity
borrowings is still fully deductible, no matter what the
proceeds are used for. And borrowers can deduct an even
greater amount, as long as the proceeds go to finance home
improvement.
   With deductions on all other consumer debt destined to be
phased out entirely by next year, it is no wonder the
popularity of home-equity debt -- to finance everything from
new cars to college tuition -- has soared. Total home-equity
credits outstanding amounted to $230 billion in 1989, an $80
billion rise from 1985, according to SMR Research Corp., a
financial-services research firm. Most of that growth was in
home-equity lines, which ballooned to $95 billion from just
$18 billion.
   But the danger for borrowers -- and a growing worry for
regulators -- is the prospect of falling home prices, which
could erode the equity backing these loans, and in extreme
cases cause individuals to lose their homes. Recently, a
senior examiner for the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency reportedly warned a group of bankers in Washington
that "underwriting standards are not as tough as they should
be" in granting such loans.
   That's the kind of concern prompting lenders to become
more discriminating. The Fed survey in February found that
25% of the 48 respondents said they're "more conservative"
than they were six months ago in the appraisals used to
calculate maximum credit lines.
   "We're being more disciplined in making appraisals," says
Denison Gallaudet, executive director of retail banking at
Bank of Boston. "In Maine, we used to rely on tax rolls, and
in Connecticut we did drive-bys; now we get full appraisals."
   The Fed survey also found that some 19% of respondents had
lowered loan-to-value ratios, while 12.5% had tightened
debt-to-income ratios.
   Typically, lenders don't grant home-equity credits equal
to more than 80% of the equity value of the property. Now, in
specific problem areas, such as Connecticut, Boston and the
New York co-op market, some lenders are lowering their
loan-to-value maximums to 70% to 75%.
   That probably won't cramp many borrowers, however. "Even
when we set ratios at 80%, the typical borrower never wants
the maximum," says Derrald Johnson, marketing director for
direct consumer loans at Bank of America, which has $7
billion of home equity loans and credit lines outstanding. In
fact, most lenders say actual loan-to-value ratios average
only 60% to 65%.
   Meanwhile, to ensure the borrower's ability to repay, most
banks refuse to lend if the borrower's total debt servicing
costs -- including first mortgage, home equity loan and other
consumer credit -- exceed 36% to 40% of gross income.
   "There's no indication that there's a reason to tighten
for any lenders who handled this product properly," says Mr.
Johnson.
