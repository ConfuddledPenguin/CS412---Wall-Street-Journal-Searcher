   PSC Publications, a New York-based magazine publisher,
said it filed for bankruptcy court protection while it
attempts to sell its Games magazine.
   Gerard Calabrese, president, said the closely held company
took on $7 million of debt when it formed in 1987 for the
purpose of purchasing Needlecraft For Today from Bassion
Publishing and Games from Playboy Enterprises Inc. In 1988,
PSC also purchased Creative Ideas For Living from Southern
Progress Corp., a subsidiary of then Time Inc.

   While Games magazine and a spinoff, Games Junior, were a
success with advertisers and readers, Mr. Calabrese said
Needlecraft For Today "faced stiff competition from other
craft magazines and was a cash drain. It was our undoing."
   PSC is now selling its magazines. Creative Ideas For
Living was sold in March to Sampler Publications of St.
Charles, Ill. PSC is currently negotiating the sale of Games
and Games Junior. Sources close to the company said Walt
Disney Co. is one of the interested buyers. Disney couldn't
be reached for comment.
