   Washington, D.C. -- At the 1913 Armory Show of
international modern art in New York, Albert Pinkham Ryder
(1847-1917) was the only American honored with an exhibition
of his own in one of the central rooms. It was a curious
choice, to give Ryder the same importance as other modernist
"ancestors" such as Van Gogh, Gauguin and Cezanne. Ryder was
generally regarded as an eccentric and romantic artist -- not
"modern" in the sense of picking contemporary subjects or
painting with bold colors.
   But the exhibition of Ryder's work currently at the
National Museum of American Art here shows that the Armory
show organizers were on to something. Ryder's mature works
are "modern" in a deep and subtle way. His compositions are
simplified to the point of verging on abstraction. They also
clearly emphasize an inner vision and timeless, archetypal
subjects as against the incidental and anecdotal themes
typical of so much American art of the period.

   Ryder, as this exhibition also makes clear, was one of the
most enigmatic and problematic of American artists, as well
as one of the greatest. Born in New Bedford, Mass., he went
to New York City when he was about 20 years old, and with the
exception of brief trips to Europe, he spent most of his life
there. Yet surprisingly little is known about his personal
life. Though convivial in his earlier years, he became
increasingly reclusive during the 1880s, and ended up as a
true eccentric living in Bohemian squalor.
   He worked on his pictures obsessively, incessantly
repainting them, with what seemed like an utter disregard for
the practical side of life, or for the niceties of artistic
technique. An affliction of the eyes made it painful for him
to look at bright light or at small details, and he was given
to long nocturnal walks. Although he was apparently
emotionally repressed in his everyday life, his paintings are
astonishingly passionate. In them you see reflected the kind
of innocent enthusiasm that made children so fond of him, and
also the sort of bizarre emotional intensity that once
impelled him to propose marriage to a neighbor because of her
violin playing.
   Many of his paintings were so heavily reworked and
employed such idiosyncratically experimental techniques that
they began to deteriorate almost immediately after they were
finished. Today, many of his works are riddled with cracks
and fissures, and some have become so dark that their
subjects can hardly be made out. Even during his lifetime, a
number of his pictures were extensively reworked by
restorers, and shortly after his death forgeries began to
appear by the hundreds.
   And yet, the poetry that emanates from his works is so
great that they seem to defy their physical ruin. In fact, as
you walk through this exhibition, you become increasingly
aware of the degree to which the cracking and darkening
actually seem to enhance the spirituality of the pictures by
giving them an uncanny aura, like that of holy relics.
   The exhibition is arranged chronologically, starting with
a number of the moody, lyrical landscapes that reveal Ryder's
enormous early admiration for Corot. It is here that we see
him gradually beginning to work in what would be his typical
manner, eliminating small details and grouping his forms in
unified masses. Although the early paintings don't have the
resonance of his mature works, they are poetic and already
display the introspective melancholy that marks almost
everything he did.
   The installation of the works here is quite engaging. An
entire gallery is given over to Ryder's decorative
commissions, which include an elaborate mirror frame
illustrated with episodes from a poem by Joseph Rodman Drake,
and panels for a lovely folding screen in the Oriental
manner. There are also some lyrically simplified landscapes
here painted on gilded leather that look for all the world
like Chinese brush paintings.
   The museum has even constructed a kind of North African
tiled atrium, complete with fountain, to display just two of
the jewel-like paintings Ryder did of Moroccan themes. Such
installations can look irrelevant or even silly, but this one
is done so tastefully that it actually enhances our
experience of the paintings. It also offers respite in the
middle of a show filled with a lot of dark and moody
pictures.
   The exhibition really picks up emotional steam with the
moonlit seascapes. The National Museum's own "Moonlight," a
disarmingly simple composition of a boat with a ragged sail
hugging the horizon under a full moon, suggests infinite
mystery. In "With Sloping Mast and Dipping Prow" (the title
is from Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"), the misty
moonlit night evokes a heart-rending solitude.
   A number of Ryder's paintings have literary themes, many
from Anglo-American literature, some from the Bible. The
gallery given over to "Grand Themes" shows how versatile
Ryder could be, despite his limited palette and simplified
compositional formats. The "Scottish Castle" is a ferocious
little picture, nearly all black, of a castle perched on a
cliff above a thundering sea. "The Flying Dutchman," with its
stormy sea and ghostly ship, is chillingly vivid. And the
tumultuous "Jonah," with its spiraling, storm-tossed
composition, and its stunning juxtaposition between the
struggling sinner and his implacable God, may well be the
most dramatic shipwreck painting of all time. After this,
even the famous and haunting "The Race Track (Death on a Pale
Horse)" seems almost tame.
   Elizabeth Broun, chief curator and acting director of the
museum, has written an exemplary catalog for the show, which
runs until July 29, and then will reopen at the Brooklyn
Museum Sept. 14.
