   Buffalo, N.Y. -- To veterans of the avant-garde music
scene, Aki Takahashi's piano recital was a mix of what
they've come to expect at the annual North American New Music
Festival here at the State University of New York. This
Japanese virtuoso thunderously pounded her forearms on the
keys, hit notes with her flattened palms, and recited or
whistled while she played. That was the expectable part.
   What was far out at the festival was Ms. Takahashi's
choice of composers. Instead of the usual gamut of
experimentalists -- Wuorinen, Zorn or Boulez -- she had
picked works that, with one exception, were all by John
Lennon and Paul McCartney. The exception was George Harrison.

   Ms. Takahashi, backed by the Japanese record company
Toshiba EMI, has been hiring avant-garde composers from
around the world to make piano arrangements of Beatles songs.
Already she has nearly two dozen such arrangements in hand by
everyone from John Cage to young Japanese composers. She has
approached Norway's mystical Per Norgard; the Cambodian
colorist Chanary Ung; the British composer-pianist of gloomy
Gershwin arrangements Michael Finnissy; the American composer
Alvin Lucier, who experiments with the subtleties of acoustic
phenomenon; the left-wing, multistylistic American in Rome,
Frederic Rzewski; the quirky German experimentalist, Walter
Zimmerman; and many others. It is Ms. Takahashi's goal to
include a representative from every major country where new
music is practiced and to gather enough material for three
CDs, the first of which has just been released in Japan.
   It isn't quite clear, however, whether Toshiba EMI had any
idea just what it was getting into when it first suggested to
Ms. Takahashi that she record Beatles songs arranged for
piano. The firm isn't known for its spirit of adventure, and
it originally had something more traditionally commercial in
mind, namely hiring a Japanese pop arranger. But Ms.
Takahashi is uncompromising in her musical tastes.
   She favors composers furthest out of the mainstream, on
the cutting edge.
   And now that her Beatles project is under way, Toshiba EMI
seems not to know quite what to do with it. Ms. Takahashi
laments that the Japanese record producers are
unsophisticated about the international market, and that does
seem to be the case. Brown Meggs, the head of EMI Angel, the
American wing of EMI, which has first rights to all
international EMI releases, said he hadn't yet been informed
of the project but that he surely would bring it out here.
   But the festival hardly seemed more savvy in exploiting
publicity for the American premiere of what it clumsily
dubbed "The Beatles Arrangements Collection." (Toshiba EMI is
calling the recording, "HyperBeatles.") The concert wasn't
heavily promoted and took place in a funky alternative space
-- a downtown art gallery called Hallwalls -- with folding
chairs set up for a couple hundred listeners, a makeshift bar
that sold cheap beer and flat soda, and a noisy backstage
refrigerator that seemed to rattle Ms. Takahashi.
   Still, the concert couldn't have been more fascinating.
Few of the arrangements were arrangements at all, but short
new works written in a modern style based loosely on the
Beatles. That is to say that a number of the composers were
inspired to write music reflecting what the Beatles meant to
them rather than just to make new versions of Beatles music.
   For some, the Beatles were still politically relevant.
Peter Garland, a Santa Fe, N.M.-based composer and one of
those who asks for substantial forearm banging, used "You've
Got to Hide Your Love Away" as an elegy for the Beijing
students who participated in last summer's uprising. Mr.
Rzewski's spectacularly kinetic "Short Fantasy on `Give Peace
a Chance'" couldn't have been clearer in its message. Mr.
Zimmerman's "When I'm 84" brought the Lennon-McCartney
standard "When I'm 64" up to date by 20 years. The score has
a metronome marking of 84, it contains 84 chords, and it
requires Ms. Takahashi to count to 84 in Japanese while she
plays.
   Others responded more spiritually to Ms. Takahashi's
assignment. Pauline Oliveros, a composer interested in the
meditative aspects of music, turned "Norwegian Wood" into a
lovely mantra. Raphael Mostel, a New York composer who heads
the Tibetan Singing Bowl Ensemble, reacted to the romanticism
of the Beatles in "Beatles Sweet," which includes a musing
combination of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" in the left
hand against "Here Comes the Sun" in the right.
   And then there were the inevitable show pieces. Yvar
Mikhashoff, a pianist himself with an extraordinary
technique, wrote a series of wildly galloping arpeggios in
"Mikhachelle." The Japanese avant-gardists tended to be less
whimsical, generally adding lots of dissonances to the scores
or deconstructing them into unrecognizability, but always in
highly virtuosic ways. And while few of the renditions
actually rocked, the Los Angeles computer composer Carl Stone
came close in his fractured version of "She Said, She Said."
Alvin Curran brought elements of modern jazz to his version
of "Eleanor Rigby," but his pounding minimalist version of
"When I'm 64" (not played at the concert but on the
forthcoming CD) is the real dazzler.
   Standing apart from all this was Mr. Cage's "The Beatles
1962-1970." He changed nothing in the music and didn't
restrict himself to a single song. He simply subjected the
Beatles entire oeuvre to chance procedures and wound up with
snippets from 27 songs to be played by six pianos
simultaneously. For the concert, Ms. Takahashi performed one
part live against prerecorded renditions of the others, and
the result was an eight-minute Beatles celebration, with
distinguishable Beatles phrases tossed about in lush,
serendipitous counterpoint.
   For her recital, Ms. Takahashi selected 14 arrangements
from a list of 19 printed in the program, and she gamely and
musically attended to anything the composers threw at her.
And like any good entertainer, she left one still curious for
more, such as for Mr. Lucier's "ANY BEATLES SONG(S)," which
requires the piano to be amplified through a small speaker
dropped into a teapot, or Mr. Norgard's version of
"Blackbird" subtitled "Paul Meets Bird."
   One also wonders about what Mr. Finnissy will come up
with. He was to have preceded Ms. Takahashi's concert with a
program of his Gershwin arrangements, but he was prevented
from doing so by the Gershwin estate, which withheld its
permission at the last minute. So Ms. Takahashi compensated
him with a Beatles commission, since she apparently has an
easier time negotiating permissions with Michael Jackson, who
owns the rights to the Beatles songs.
