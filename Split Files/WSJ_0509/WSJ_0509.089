   NEW YORK -- Marine Midland Banks Inc. said that its
parent, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd., invested $200
million in new capital in Marine. The investment is split
evenly between equity and subordinated debt.
   The investment brings Marine's Tier 1 capital (chiefly
common equity) to 4.7%, up from 4.1% March 30. Hongkong bank
has said that it plans to boost Marine's Tier 1 capital to 5%
by the end of this year.

   Ann L. Robinson, a bond analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, called the increased investment "a nice statement
of support" by the parent, especially in light of Marine's
rising levels of troubled loans.
