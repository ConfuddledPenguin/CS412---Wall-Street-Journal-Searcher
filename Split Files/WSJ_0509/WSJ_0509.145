   Alpha said it plans to work with Pacific Western's present
management and board to maximize shareholder value. While it
has no plans at present, such activities may involve a sale
of the company to a third party, the filing said.
   A spokesman for Alpha Capital said the company doesn't
have current plans to expand its holding but may do so in the
future.
   Phillip R. Boyce, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pacific Western Bancshares, said the move simply increases a
friendly and longstanding investment in the company by Alpha.
