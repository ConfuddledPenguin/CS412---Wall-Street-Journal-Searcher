   TORONTO -- General Motors Corp.'s Canadian sales arm said
it will take over distribution of Saab cars in Canada as of
Sept. 1, marketing the Swedish luxury vehicles through GM's
existing Passport franchise.
   But GM and Saab spokesmen said no such move is planned for
the much larger U.S. market, where Saab has 363 dealers. GM
and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden late last year formed a 50-50
joint venture, Saab Automobile AB, to take over Saab's
struggling car-making operations. Worldwide Saab sales
dropped 15% during the first quarter to 24,700 cars. Sales of
Saabs in the U.S. have skidded 33% since 1986.

   A Saab spokesman in the U.S. said the decision to
terminate the franchise agreements of Saab's 32 Canadian
dealers was "a business decision to have more effective
marketing." GM's Passport division has 63 dealers, and plans
to add another 20 by the year end. Passport dealers will put
the Saab 900 and 9000 luxury models, priced at between 25,000
Canadian dollars (US21,495) and C$55,000, alongside
Passport's current line of cars, which include the
Korean-built Optima sedan and the Impulse car and Trooper
sport utility vehicle, built in Japan.
   George Peapples, president of GM of Canada, said he
expects Saab car sales in Canada will rise within two years
to about 2,000 to 2,500 cars annually from 1,000 to 1,500
currently.
