   NEW YORK -- Yields on most small-denomination certificates
of deposit at major banks rose slightly in the week ended
yesterday, although average yields fell at major brokerage
firms and on "jumbo" CDs.
   CDs in denominations of $90,000 and more and those sold by
broker-dealers both tend to closely follow interest-rate
trends. Rates generally turned down sharply Friday.

   The average yield on a one-year consumer CD, which
typically requires a minimum deposit of between $500 and
$25,000, rose to 8.10% from 8.08%, according to a survey of
18 major banks by Banxquote Money Markets, an information
service based here. Five-year consumer CDs went to 8.32% from
8.26%.
   In contrast, Banxquote reported that the average yield on
one-year CDs sold by major brokerage firms fell to 8.42% from
8.49% in the latest week, while the average on one-year
jumbos fell to 8.25% from 8.33%. Yields on longer-term CDs
fell the most. Average yields for five-year, broker-sold CDs
fell to 8.78% from 8.93%. Average yields on five-year,
large-denomination CDs slipped to 8.50% from 8.59%.
   "Savings CDs went up because they were still lagging the
market by about a week or two," said Norberto Mehl, chairman
of Banxquote, noting that some banks raised savings CD rates
while lowering yields on other types of CDs. New York's
Citibank, for example, raised the yield on its two-year
savings CD to 8.60% from 8.06%, but lowered the yield on
one-year jumbo CDs to 8.11% from 8.42%. "This illustrates the
sharp contrast in the two segments of the market," said Mr.
Mehl.
   Despite the recent decline in interest rates, it's still
possible to find CDs that pay more than 9%. Continental Bank
in Illinois offers a five-year savings CD with a yield of
9.06%, and a five-year jumbo CD at 9.16%, while Bank of
America in California offers a five-year jumbo CD with a
yield of 9.03%.
