   WASHINGTON -- The budget debate in Washington has taken a
sudden turn toward taxes.
   President Bush, who until last week was sticking to his
read-my-lips pledge of no new taxes, told congressional
leaders Sunday he was willing to enter budget negotiations
with "no preconditions."

   Confused? Here's an insider's guide to lip-reading in
Washington:
   Has the president abandoned his no new-taxes pledge?
   The pledge, although stated in unequivocal terms, has
always had some wiggle room. A look at the president's fiscal
1991 budget discloses a few billion dollars of small tax
increases: boosts in the airline ticket tax and Social
Security taxes for state employees, an extension of the
telephone excise tax, and more.
   In the past, the administration has brushed over such tax
increases by using jargon such as "user fees." Budget
Director Richard Darman made clear in testimony last year,
however, that any tax large enough to catch the public's
attention is, by definition, a violation of the president's
pledge. He called it the "duck" test: If it looks like a
duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.
   The latest White House estimates show the administration
and Congress must cut the deficit $50 billion or more to meet
the targets of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. If the
president is serious about raising that much money, and
administration officials say he is, he'll have to do some
serious quacking.
   What kind of taxes will the president and Congress be
considering?
   Some Republican legislators say the administration won't
raise the income tax, and instead point to alcohol and
tobacco taxes. But those don't raise much money. Doubling the
federal excise tax on cigarettes raises only $3 billion a
year. A 25% rise in alcohol taxes would raise about $7
billion.
   Some Democrats, on the other hand, want to raise the top
tax rate to 33% for high-income taxpayers. Currently, a
family of four with an income between $75,000 and $200,000
pays a marginal tax rate of 33%, but a family earning more
than $200,000 pays only 28%. The change would raise about $4
billion next year and $10 billion a year by 1995.
   GOP Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming said the president might
also be willing to go for some kind of national sales tax,
but few lawmakers believe that's a likely option.
   What about energy taxes?
   Now there's big money. A 25-cent-a-gallon increase in the
tax on gasoline would raise $25 billion a year, and
proponents say it would be good for the environment, too.
   The problem is that gasoline taxes create civil war in
Congress. People in the big Western states, who often
practically live in their cars, would feel the hit much
harder than those in Northeastern cities, who rely on public
transportation.
   Another possibility is an oil-import fee. That falls hard
on those in the Northeast who heat their homes with oil. But
it's a boon to domestic oil producers, and therefore is
beloved by the Texans who hold positions of influence in
Congress and, of course, in the White House.
   A possible compromise: a tax on all forms of energy --
known as a "B.T.U. tax."
   One result could be a package of energy tax changes,
probably including new tax breaks for drilling that have long
been advocated by the president.
   Has the president given up on his efforts to cut the
capital-gains tax rate?
   Not by a long shot. The administration is likely to insist
that a cut in the tax rate on long-term gains be part of the
budget package. Democrats, in turn, will attack that as a
giveaway to the rich, and insist it be accompanied by an
increase in the top rate to 33%. If the president won't
agree, the result could be stalemate.
   Will the budget agreement affect Social Security checks?
   Possibly. In the struggle to raise $50 billion, the
budgeteers will have to go to the big programs, and, after
defense, Social Security is the biggest.
   One option being talked about on Capitol Hill is to raise
the amount of a high-income person's Social Security check
that's subject to taxes. Currently, only 50% of a high-income
recipient's benefit is subject to income taxes. Raising that
to 85% would bring in $6 billion a year by 1995.
   Why has the president changed his tune now?
   The reasons are largely economic. High interest rates are
increasing government spending, and sluggish corporate
profits are bringing down government revenues. As a result,
estimates of the size of budget cut needed to meet the
Gramm-Rudman law's targets next year have risen to more than
$50 billion from $35 billion.
   In addition, some administration officials worry that
rising interest rates could push the economy into a recession
next year. Cutting the budget deficit, they hope, will ease
pressure on interest rates.
   Does the borrowing to finance the savings-and-loan bailout
have anything to do with this?
   Mr. Darman told lawmakers that if the borrowing for S&amp;Ls
is counted, the budget next year could fall as much as $100
billion short of the Gramm-Rudman law's deficit target, which
is $64 billion. But he also said the budget summit is likely
to exclude that borrowing from deficit accounting.
   Nevertheless, the S&amp;L borrowing is one more force driving
up interest rates and causing the administration to rethink
its position on taxes.
