   Graphic Scanning Corp. said it paid off an $11 million
note related to a settlement of litigation between the
Englewood, N.J., company and Barry Yampol, founder and former
chairman.
   In January, Mr. Yampol agreed to accept the 12% promissory
note, in addition to a payment of $16 million and a warrant
to buy one million Graphic shares, to settle his suits
against the company. Mr. Yampol had charged after being
ousted in a proxy fight that he wasn't compensated for
certain businesses started during his tenure.

   Separately, the telecommunications-services concern said
stockholders elected a board that included the addition of
James Greenwald and Robert Price, bringing the total number
of members to 10.
   In March, Gabelli Group Inc., a New York investment firm
that controls the equivalent of 38.8% of Graphic shares, said
it couldn't support an earlier group of directors proposed by
the company and suggested that Graphic nominate
"knowledgeable industry professionals." In response, the
company added Mr. Greenwald, president and chief executive
officer of Katz Communications Inc., and Mr. Price, president
of Price Communications Corp. Katz and Price are both New
York-based broadcasting concerns.
