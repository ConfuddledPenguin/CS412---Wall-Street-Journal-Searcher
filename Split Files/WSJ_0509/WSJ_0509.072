   When the White House this week announced it would set "no
preconditions" on deficit-cutting talks, it opened the door
to reversing its position on George Bush's campaign promise
of no new taxes. But if Washington is beginning to crack on
this central issue, the states are standing firm.
   A dozen or more state governments could face meaningful
tax-reduction or limitation initiatives this fall. America's
grass roots are talking, and their words don't include
"revenue enhancement" or other euphemisms for tax increases.
A look at some state initiatives and petitions in the field
shows that this year will see a new surge in ballot
propositions aiming to reduce taxes and state spending.

   -- Colorado: Last fall, activists under Douglas Bruce were
the first in the country to gain a spot on the November
ballot for a tax-reduction initiative. The new measure
combines meaningful limitations on taxation with phased-in
relief in some categories. Backers of the initiative are
likely to survive legal challenges. If they do, their
November match will be one of the most important in the
nation.
   -- Massachusetts: Citizens for Limited Taxation is back
with a sophisticated initiative that will subject to a
statewide popular vote all tax increases enacted in the
Legislature in the 1989-90 cycle. At a time when Republicans
are outregistering Democrats two-to-one, this latest
initiative could represent the first opportunity for voters
to reject directly the high-tax, high-spending policies of
the departing Dukakis administration.
   Under the commonwealth's indirect provisions for the
process, the Bay State initiative faced legislative scrutiny
in late April. Then the Democrat-dominated Legislature
rejected the tax-slashing proposal. If backers can garner a
few thousand new valid names on petitions, the initiative
will go to the people this fall.
   -- California: Joel Fox of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association announced a new initiative drive in late
December, aiming for this November's ballot. Called the
"Taxpayers Right to Vote Act of 1990," it gives voters more
direct control over both general and special taxes at the
state and local levels.
   The measure attacks future government revenues, spending
and services. Mr. Fox maintains the initiative is designed
merely to reinvigorate tax limits passed but gutted through
judicial interpretation. As a result of a blend of paid
circulators, direct mail and volunteer activists, a statewide
popular vote is virtually certain.
   -- Illinois: The National Taxpayers United of Illinois met
a May 4 deadline for submission to state officials of at
least 251,595 valid signatures on a new initiative. The
initiative would require all tax hikes to go through a
special legislative committee, and mandate legislative super
majorities of 60% for future tax increases in the high-tax
state. In fact, the group was able to turn in 470,292
signatures, subject to verification. The group has made a
strong start.
   Win or lose, the initiative made a difference: After
conservative Republican Steve Baer -- who emphasized his
strong support for the initiative -- garnered one-third of
the vote in the March 20 gubernatorial primary, GOP nominee
Jim Edgar endorsed the NTUI measure in early April.
   Democratic nominee Neil Hartigan also announced support
for the initiative, and for a month the two gubernatorial
nominees have tried to outdo one another in rejecting the
high-tax policies of retiring Governor Jim Thompson.
   All 28 Republicans in the state Senate have introduced an
identical proposal in the Legislature, assuring the
initiative drive continued life even if it does not survive
the state's byzantine initiative provisions.
   -- Oklahoma: Legislators last month enacted staggering tax
increases for education. The controversial increases in state
sales, income and corporate taxes came after five Democratic
senators switched from opposition to support of a crucial
"emergency" clause putting the hikes into effect immediately,
and avoiding a popular referendum drive.
   The switches came after thousands of teachers left
classrooms on April 16 and flooded the state capital to back
"education reform" -- although what finally passed did not
include mandated consolidation of rural districts, parental
choice or other reforms. The package results in pay raises
for teachers over a five-year period, with some increases in
funding for specific programs. Liberal Republican Governor
Henry Bellmon backed the tax hikes, and so did Steve Lewis,
Democratic speaker of the House. Mr. Lewis was rewarded
within days with an endorsement from the National Education
Association affiliate.
   But the tides could shift. All the GOPers and several of
the Democrats running to replace Gov. Bellmon this fall
oppose the increases. Grassroots forces immediately coalesced
around Dan Brown, an Oklahoma City stockbroker, and plans for
a tax-limitation initiative began. Through early this month,
thousands of calls to Mr. Brown's office indicated widespread
popular fury at the hikes, and a willingness to go into the
field with initiative petitions. It is not clear whether the
tax-cut activists would go for a simple repeal of the new
levies or seek tax-limitation provisions. Even a successful
drive may not garner a popular vote until 1991 -- and a
hostile governor could delay any vote until 1992.
   -- Michigan: At least two related initiatives are aiming
for the ballot. Individuals and groups that helped defeat two
tax-hike proposals in November could prove potent in drives
to cap or limit taxation.
   A statutory initiative to the Legislature -- whose
supporters are expected to submit their goal of 240,000 names
this month -- would roll back property tax assessments by up
to 20%. Under this rare form of initiative, legislators get a
chance to consider the proposal as a simple law without the
threat of gubernatorial veto. The tax cut plan might still
find its way to a statewide popular vote.
   Another initiative petition to limit taxes faces a July
petitioning deadline if supporters want to garner a spot on
this year's ballot.
   -- Oregon: Portland activists close to the late Ray
Phillips, a Jarvis-like figure in the state, are back with a
proposal to cut property taxes in half over a five-year
period. The initiative supporters will probably submit
sufficient valid names later this month, assuring them a spot
on what will likely be a statewide November ballot already
crowded with environmental and other initiatives.
   As the spring ends, a variety of other tax reduction or
limitation ballot propositions have fair prospects of
securing ballot spots and passing in November. South Dakota
has a mixed program. One measure slated would roll back some
taxes, but a second would allow a state income tax. Activists
plan to support the first and oppose the second.
   In Nevada, voters will ponder a constitutional measure
banning imposition of a state income tax. The initiative
passed in 1988, but must be considered a second time under
the state's provisions. In Montana, a drive to limit spending
seems to be emerging. Nebraska's Taxpayers Survival Committee
initiative filed a tax reduction initiative with the state
government last July. Bill Heusiler, a tax-cut veteran in
Arizona, is joined by supporters in contemplating a major
property-tax reduction effort. A taxcut effort might still
emerge in North Dakota. In all four states, tax reducers face
mid-summer deadlines to gather sufficient valid names.
   An initiative limiting new property taxes is possible in
Florida. In that state, the petition circulation process
might draw out matters into the 1992 election. Utahans, who
have rejected recent aggressive tax reduction efforts, might
look more favorably on a possible initiative to cut taxes on
food sales.
   The question for 1990 is whether the electorate in some or
most of the states is ready to move beyond opposition to tax
hikes to actual approval of tax reductions and meaningful
spending limitations.
   Leaders in the various initiative drives are, of course,
hoping this year will see the return of the tax revolt that
peaked a decade ago. In any case, Americans this season may
be preparing to send a message to Washington. Come November,
George Bush may find that voters paid closer attention to his
campaign promises than he thought. Don't be surprised if
Americans tell the president, "Read our lips . . ."
