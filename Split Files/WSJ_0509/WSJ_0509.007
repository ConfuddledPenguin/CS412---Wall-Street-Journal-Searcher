   Officials said the orders, already close to an annual
record tonnage of four million tons in 1983, were valued at
$3.13 billion, more than double a year ago.
   They said South Korean shipyards completed 761,000 tons of
ships in the past four months and are expected to complete
about 3.6 million tons of ships this year if workers end
their strike soon at the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
shipyard in Ulsan, the world's largest.
