   PHILADELPHIA -- Westmoreland Coal Co., aided by a
sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity,
declared a quarterly dividend of eight cents a share, its
first payout in almost two years.
   Westmoreland suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents
a share in mid-1988 as it stepped up a program to streamline
all aspects of its business. Marginal assets and operations
were sold, hundreds of hourly wage jobs and 140 management
positions were eliminated and such executive perks as
company-paid health benefits were reduced.

   "The restructuring is behind us," said Pemberton
Hutchinson, Westmoreland's president and chief executive
officer. "Now we will see the benefits." The dividend is
payable June 11 to stock of record May 18.
   He cited lower administrative costs, reduced debt, more
efficient mining equipment and an improved safety record. For
1989, Westmoreland reported net income jumped to $11.5
million from $1.5 million the year before as revenue rose to
$600 million from $593 million.
   Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1990 per-share earnings will
exceed last year's level of $1.39, but he didn't make a
specific forecast. "I can't be more enthusiastic about 1990,"
he told the annual meeting.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Westmoreland closed at $22.25, up 75 cents.
   This year, Westmoreland is working with new customers in
West Germany that will be able to take delivery for the first
time of U.S.-produced coal because of the company's new
shipping and off-loading capabilities in Europe. Mr.
Hutchinson also said Westmoreland plans to increase its
ownership stake in Dominion Terminal Associates, a
rail-to-ship loading terminal in Newport News, Va.
Westmoreland now owns 17.5% of the facility and will acquire
an additional 2.5% interest without taking on any new debt,
he said.
   In addition, Mr. Hutchinson predicted that Westmoreland
will benefit from pending clean-air legislation because the
company produces low-sulfur coal. Demand for low-sulfur coal
is expected to increase as utilities move to comply with
stricter federal pollution rules. In the 1990 first quarter,
Westmoreland sold 4.6 million tons of coal, compared with 4.4
million tons in the year-earlier period.
