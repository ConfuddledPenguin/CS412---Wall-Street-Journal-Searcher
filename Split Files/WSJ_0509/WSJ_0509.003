   TORONTO -- The city council delayed its decision on a
motion that would downgrade commercial zoning of prime
undeveloped land near the city's financial core, including 35
acres held by Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s real estate unit,
Marathon Realty Co.
   The council instead referred the matter to the city's
commissioner of planning, who is to report back in three
weeks on whether a 1985 zoning agreement on the land should
be reviewed. As previously reported, the council was to
consider a resolution that would greatly reduce the amount of
commercial development allowed on the 200 acres of
properties, and increase the amount of housing permitted.

   Analysts have said the motion, if approved, would lower
the value of Marathon's holdings in the block and could hurt
Marathon's stock price when it begins trading on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. An Ontario court is expected to resume its
hearing today or tomorrow regarding approval of the
distribution of 80% of Marathon to Canadian Pacific
shareholders. If approval is obtained as expected, trading of
Marathon shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange would begin on
the date of distribution. It is expected that Marathon will
have 99 million shares outstanding. Canadian Pacific will
retain a 20% interest in the real estate concern.
   A spokesman for the Toronto city councilor who formulated
the downgrading motion said political battles on the issue
could drag on for a year. "There will be 50 different moves
in 25 different directions before this thing is put to bed,"
he said. Toronto's mayor is opposed to the motion.
   John Beales, Marathon's senior vice president, buildings,
said the company was relieved that council didn't decide to
renegotiate the zoning agreement. The continuing debate,
however, could delay development of Marathon's holdings, he
said.
   The properties in question, including Marathon's parcel,
are considered to be prime undeveloped land. Analysts said a
3/4 acre piece of land adjacent to the Marathon property
recently was sold for about 240 million Canadian dollars
(US$206.3 million).
