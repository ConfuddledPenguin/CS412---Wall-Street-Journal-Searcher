   A unit of General Electric Co. PLC of the U.K. has been
selected to head development of the radar system for the
four-nation Eurofighter aircraft project, U.K. Defense
Minister Tom King said.
   Mr. King said that Ferranti Defence Systems Ltd. has been
formally selected to head a consortium to develop the radar
system for the fighter aircraft. General Electric, which
isn't related to the U.S. company of the same name, estimates
the value of the contract at #300 million ($500 million),
although it could escalate substantially if Eurofighter goes
into full production by the late 1990s.

   General Electric acquired Ferranti International PLC's
defense electronics unit for #270 million in February. The
other countries involved in the Eurofighter project are
Germany, Italy and Spain.
