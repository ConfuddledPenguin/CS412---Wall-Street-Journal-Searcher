   BURBANK, Calif. -- Faced with a dearth of Pentagon work
and a need to cut costs, Lockheed Corp. decided to pull all
aircraft operations out of this city, where its founder began
building six-passenger plywood transports 62 years ago.
   The news, which shocked union representatives and Burbank
officials, was painted by the big defense contractor as
another sign of troubled times for the industry. A year ago,
Lockheed announced it planned eventually to stop assembling
planes here, but the new moves also call for clearing out
administrative and engineering staffs and discontinuing
testing.

   "Our work base has been falling off faster than our
ability" to shrink, Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep said.
   With the exodus from Burbank, the company's entire
aircraft business would be in Marietta, Ga., and Palmdale,
Calif., a 45-minute drive north of here in the high desert.
Vacated and put on the market would be all 320 acres of
Burbank land, which could fetch $1 million an acre or more.
Most Burbank property will be emptied by 1991, Mr. Tellep
said. The company already had planned to sell 225 of the
acres here and move its supersecret Skunk Works operation,
creator of the U-2 and SR-71 spyplanes, to Palmdale by 1994.
Before any land can be sold, Lockheed must settle certain
environmental issues with the city; Mr. Tellep said those
matters should be resolved by early next year.
   "It's a sad day because it really all began in Burbank for
Lockheed," said William Schoneberger, a local aviation
historian and author of "California Wings."
   Lockheed can't say how deeply employment will be cut until
there is a clearer picture of what future Pentagon work it
will perform. The company spearheads a team competing to
build the Air Force's next-generation jet fighter, and is
working out with the Navy a production schedule for the P-7
anti-submarine aircraft. Both those projects face
considerable delays, and with the improvement in superpower
relations, Lockheed will have a hard time finding products to
replace the C-5B cargo plane, P-3 sub hunter, TR-1
reconnaissance plane and F-117A Stealth fighter.
   Currently, about 10,500 people work for Lockheed in
Burbank, a third of whom are Machinists members. Lockheed,
which in 1986 moved its headquarters to the outlying Los
Angeles suburb of Calabasas from here, employs a total of
81,000. The company indicated that it would relocate
thousands in Palmdale, and several hundred in Georgia, over
the next few years.
   But plenty of pink slips could be handed out. Late last
month, Lockheed said it would lay off 2,750 at its
aircraft-making unit by the end of June, and the move from
Burbank may mean more cutting. "Given the current
environment, it would be difficult for any company to say
that this is the end of trimming the work force," Mr. Tellep
said. Job losses elsewhere have been rampant, with General
Electric Co. announcing elimination of 4,200 aerospace posts
and General Dynamics Corp. saying it could slash rolls by
7,000 at its Texas fighter plant by the mid-1990s.
   In Burbank, Machinists leaders were taken aback. "We're
going to fight this action, either by legal means or with the
help of some of our political friends," said Don Nakamoto,
spokesman for District Lodge 727. Added Burbank Mayor Thomas
Flavin: "We will do everything we can to encourage them to
stay, but, frankly, I don't know what we can offer."
   Mr. Tellep said that "to ease the sting," Lockheed will
give veteran employees extra benefits if they retire early.
Leaving Burbank, he said, is ultimately "the way to preserve
the most for the most people."
   The chairman predicted that the change will drive down
operating costs by more than $50 million a year, while paring
$75 million from capital spending through 1994. In addition,
he said, some overhead expenses will evaporate as Lockheed
leaves behind 2.3 million square feet of Burbank factory, on
top of the 3.3 million it already is trying to shed.
   Under a new arrangement Lockheed's board approved
yesterday, aircraft operations will now break into two
distinct operating companies, each reporting financial
results independently to Mr. Tellep. The companies together
will still be known as the Aeronautical Systems Group, but
headquarters will be in Marietta. In fact, the departure from
Burbank is sure to be a boon for the Atlanta suburb, where
Lockheed employment has dwindled to about 10,000 from 20,000
over the past 2 1/2 years. Lockheed's work on the Air Force's
Advanced Tactical Fighter, as part of a team with General
Dynamics and Boeing Co., also will move there.
   When the lights go out at the vast Burbank facilities,
leaving Lockheed with only two small, non-aircraft units
here, an important chapter in aviation history will end. The
company's founder, Allan Loughead -- who later changed his
name to Lockheed to match its pronunciation -- moved here in
1928 to give him and partner Jack Northrop more room to churn
out their plywood Vega plane. Since then, nearly 35,000
aircraft have been built in Burbank.
