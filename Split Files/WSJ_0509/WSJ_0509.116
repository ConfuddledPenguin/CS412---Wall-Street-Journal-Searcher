   The kind of American political history that Michael Barone
gives us -- its mood, pace, psychic landscape -- could only
have been written in the later 1980s.
   For one thing there is a refreshing centrality of the idea
of "country," put up front in the title, "Our Country: The
Shaping of America From Roosevelt to Reagan" (Macmillan/Free
Press, 805 pages, $29.95). For another, it is the first
full-scale post-Reagan history that depicts Ronald Reagan and
his America not in terms of a "dying fall" but of a renewal
of American self-confidence. In fact, in his narrative of
America's past 60 years -- varied, scarred, tumultuous, yet
somehow triumphant -- national confidence may be seen as the
real hero, from "Dr. New Deal" to the Great Communicator.

   It is the confidence that fights off the enemy --
alienation and confusion -- and summons resilience enough to
overcome tragedies and achieve a national renewal.
   In fact, Mr. Barone has the courage to demark the four
major periods of his narrative not by presidencies and
parties, or war and peace, but by exactly the mood categories
I have mentioned: "Turmoil" (for 1930 to 1947, from the
Depression to the Cold War), "Confidence" (from Harry
Truman's second term to Lyndon Johnson's election in 1964),
"Alienation" (from the cultural revolution and the Vietnam
War through Jimmy Carter in 1981), and "Resilience" (for the
Reagan years). Within this sweeping period categorization we
get a narrative flow in some 56 segments, averaging not much
more than a year, each compressing action, analysis and
national mood. If the result is episodic, the book moves
through the episodes with an almost eerie newsreel swiftness.
   Mr. Barone's aim is nothing less than to topple two models
of historical writing. One is the tradition of the
"progressive" economic and class determinists, going back to
Charles Beard and Vernon Parrington but largely unchallenged
until recently. The other is the historians who "see recent
American history as a tale of decline, the story of how a
country suffused with pride betrayed its ideals, lost a war,
and allowed its economy to wither or crumble."
   He is on target in both cases. Written by a lawyer and
journalist who is a Washington insider but is outside the
academies, this book is bound to disturb the entrenched
university elite. It is not only a portent of the times but
very likely a harbinger of other histories to come.
   To fashion a replacement for the "economic determinants"
model, Mr. Barone turns to the ethnic-cultural demographics
of elections. As author of the biennial "The Almanac of
American Politics," he has a sure command of a rich range of
material that is rarely presented in such profusion in a
general history. This demographic scrutiny of every campaign
and election (sometimes telling us more than we want to know
or retain), forms the hard outer shell of the story. Within
it, he inserts a second shell much more complex and
subjective than the first -- the procession of presidents.
His problem is to move them forward in tandem without too
much overlap. Largely he succeeds, but the end product is
scarcely a model of tidiness.
   Mr. Barone is right to see Franklin Delano Roosevelt as
the "towering" figure of the 60-year span, stretching his
influence all the way through Johnson and, yes, Reagan, who
used him as a model of presidential style even as he moved
away from Roosevelt's ideas and agenda. The author's insights
into the sources of FDR's supreme self-sufficiency and
political intuition are the more remarkable because he
doesn't move back intensively enough to present the entire
stream of influence that formed FDR's mind and character. Nor
does he move forward to project FDR's foreign-policy thinking
into its consequences for the division of Europe, which is
only now dissolving.
   I single out FDR, but much the same can be said for John
Kennedy, Johnson and Richard Nixon, whose complexities of
presidential character require even deeper rooting in their
past. It can also be said for Truman and Dwight Eisenhower,
who were less complex but whose decisions, if tracked to our
own day, have had consequences deserving greater stature than
Mr. Barone gives them.
   I like to think that at the book's center, so to speak,
there is a third, innermost shell, the probing of the
collective consciousness. Mr. Barone is sensitive to the
conviction of every ethnic and cultural segment of the people
that America ought to belong to them, even though in many
cases it doesn't. To this question of what gives legitimacy
to the collective psyche of America, his answer is the right
one: "It is our country," belonging to no one exclusively but
to all together.
   Yet on the harder question of what rules history -- what
is behind the force fields of ethnic, social and cultural
claims and struggles -- I find few clear clues in the book. I
miss a discussion of the great waves of revolutionary change
in science, knowledge, "information," the life course,
selfhood, belief, which furnished the ideas that got
translated into those biennial election results. They would
have made this important history even more important.
