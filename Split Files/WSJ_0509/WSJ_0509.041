   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its credit ratings
on long-term debt and preferred stock of Chemical Banking
Corp. and certain subsidiaries and on Fleet/Norstar Financial
Group Inc.'s senior debt.
   In Chemical's case, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. unit cited
"concerns regarding the outlook for profitability in view of
the prospective need for additional reserve building in
relation to {Chemical's} modest underlying earnings
capacity."

   In New York, Joseph G. Sponholz, Chemical's chief
financial officer, said in a statement: "We strongly disagree
with Moody's action. We find it especially incomprehensible
since it comes at a time when Chemical continues to
demonstrate strength" in its levels of past-due loans and
first-quarter earnings.
   Moody's downgraded the parent corporation's senior debt to
Baa-3 from Baa-2, its subordinated debt to Ba-2 from Ba-1 and
preferred stock to Ba-2 from Ba-1. Ratings on long-term
deposits and letters of credit of its flagship Chemical Bank
fell to Baa-1 from A-3 and to Baa-2 from Baa-1, respectively.
   For Chemical Bank (Delaware), ratings were reduced on
long-term deposits to Baa-1 from single-A-3 and on its
letters of credit to Baa-2 from Baa-1. Senior and
subordinated obligations of its Chemical Bank N.V. fell to
Baa-3 from Baa-2 and Ba-2 from Ba-1, respectively.
   Moody's reaffirmed the short-term ratings of the parent
and the flagship as well as long and short-term obligations
of its Texas Commerce Bancshares and Texas Commerce Bank.
   Moody's said its downgrade of Fleet/Norstar ratings was
prompted by the company's announcement last week that
increased nonperforming assets and write-downs resulted in a
first-quarter loss. Moody's added that, on March 30, it had
downgraded Fleet/Norstar's senior debt rating because of the
deteriorating New England economy.
   The latest downgrade, Moody's said, reflected a
first-quarter "level of asset quality deterioration somewhat
larger" than earlier projected.
   Moody's, however, said Fleet/Norstar's capital base is
stronger than most of its Northeastern peers.
   About $2.4 billion of securities were affected by the
change, in which Moody's also lowered its rating of the
long-term deposits of the bank holding company's Fleet
National Bank unit to single-A-2 from single-A-1.
   In Providence, R.I., Jack Flynn, Fleet's vice president,
finance, said: "We're disappointed {by the downgrade} but
pleased that our rating continues to be above almost all of
our Northeastern peers."
   Fleet/Norstar's first-quarter loss, stemming from a rise
in troubled assets, totaled $98.1 million, or 92 cents a
share.
