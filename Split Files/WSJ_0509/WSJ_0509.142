   The shares of ISS International Service System Inc. leaped
35% on the news that its Copenhagen-based parent, ISS AS,
proposed to acquire the 34% stake that it doesn't own for $10

   New York-based ISS International's shares rose past the
proposed offer price, indicating that investors expect a
higher price for their shares. In American Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, ISS International shares added
$2.75 to close at $10.50.
   A panel of outside directors at the subsidiary will assess
the bid, ISS International said. For advice, the panel has
retained the law firm Rogers &amp; Wells and expects to hire an
investment banker.
   Separately, the subsidiary reported that first-quarter net
income rose 6.2% to $830,000, or 12 cents a share, from
$781,000, or 11 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue edged up 2.4% to $122.2 million from $119.4 million.
