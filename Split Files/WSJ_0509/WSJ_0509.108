   WASHINGTON -- Only two days after President Bush agreed
that bipartisan budget talks should begin without any
preconditions, Republicans tried to yank income taxes off the
table and Democrats vowed to reject any tax increases they
consider inequitable.
   With some misgivings, Democrats in the Senate and the
House agreed yesterday that they have little choice but to
accept Mr. Bush's invitation to a so-called budget summit.
Congressional leaders are to meet with Mr. Bush this morning
to tell him that. Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) said talks could begin before the week
ends.

   While the White House stuck tenaciously to its pledge to
avoid preconditions, Republican Whip Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming declared flatly: "Nobody's talking about raising
income tax rates."
   And other Republicans went even farther. "I'm opposed to
having taxes be on the table, period," said Rep. Bill
Schuette (R., Mich.), who is challenging incumbent Democratic
Sen. Sander Levin.
   Democrats, on the other hand, insist they won't agree to
any package that relies exclusively on raising revenue by
cutting capital-gains tax rates and imposing regressive
energy and excise taxes. They will press for an increase in
the marginal income tax rate on the richest Americans, now
28%. Many Democrats consider that unfair because some
less-wealthy taxpayers face a 33% marginal rate -- the rate
on the last dollar of income.
   And as Democratic leaders try to assemble a coalition, the
call by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) for cutting Social
Security payroll taxes may find new support, even among those
who were cool to the idea before.
   "It can't just be gasoline taxes," said House Budget
Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "It demands that
Democrats be for equity, and that means `the bubble' {Capitol
Hill jargon for raising the marginal tax rate on the richest
taxpayers above the current 28%} or Moynihan."
   At separate House and Senate caucuses, Democrats
repeatedly expressed fears that Mr. Bush will use a budget
summit to make them take the blame for raising taxes. "They
have just one goal: To put the tax noose around our neck,"
said Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.).
   Sen. Sasser voiced the same fear. "If revenues are used to
solve this problem," he said, "the president will say, `the
Democrats made me do it.'" When talks begin, Sen. Sasser
vowed, "The first question I'm going to ask {Mr. Bush} is,
`What is your proposal?'"
   At the House caucus, some Democrats demanded that
President Bush clearly state the dimensions of the present
deficit so the public will understand why taxes may be
needed. White House Budget Director Richard Darman may be
called to Capitol Hill to testify on his revised deficit
estimates and the administration's proposed solutions.
   Distrust of the White House is so strong among Democrats
in Congress that one Southern Democrat even suggested that
the different sides communicate in writing so that all
understand what they are getting into. Rank-and-file
Democrats warned their leaders that they aren't blindly
promising to accept whatever the summit produces.
   In short, Democrats don't want to be trapped. "They don't
want to be blamed for the result," said Rep. Panetta. "It
will take a lot of good faith," he added. "It's very tough to
find good faith in an election year."
   The primary goal of budget talks will be to assemble a
package of revenue increases and spending cuts to avoid
triggering across-the-board spending cuts this fall under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Budget Director Darman
says that means paring more than $50 billion from the
deficit. The Gramm-Rudman deficit target for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, is $64 billion.
   Taxes, of course, won't be the only controversy.
Republicans and Democrats differ sharply on how much to cut
the defense budget and how hard to squeeze domestic spending.
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater yesterday said
Mr. Bush wants one comprehensive pact that sustains economic
growth, cuts the deficit over more than one year and
overhauls of the often-criticized federal budget process.
   But taxes were about the only issue on the lips of members
of Congress yesterday, both because of the uncertainty over
Mr. Bush's position and because some Republicans are
convinced that their party's fortunes rest on their image as
tax foes. Some Republicans are particularly upset that their
leaders, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Robert Michel of
Illinois, seemed resigned to tax increases after joining
their Democratic counterparts at a meeting with Mr. Bush
Sunday night.
   "If the Republicans are dumb enough to give up the tax
issues," said Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), "you bet it's going
to hurt us at the polls." He called the public's perception
of the differences between the two parties' stances on taxes
"the most significant distinction . . . in this post-Cold War
era."
   Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.), who is using the tax issue in
her campaign to replace Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), said
yesterday that she isn't concerned that Mr. Bush will somehow
undercut her chances by agreeing to tax increases in a
summit. But she drew a much harder line on taxes than the
administration has, ruling out increases in personal taxes,
corporate taxes and "consumer taxes."
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia added that
no summit agreement will erase the distinction between the
two parties. "They aren't going to undo {Walter} Mondale,
{Michael} Dukakis and {Jesse} Jackson in one signing
ceremony," he said.
   Republican pollster Vincent Baglio, though counseling
Republican candidates not to waver from their no-new-taxes
stance now, says that President Bush's popularity could
prevent any tax increases from hurting the party. "Clearly,
George Bush has tremendous popularity, and any politician
with tremendous popularity can lead public opinion as well as
take some direction from it."
   Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, predicts
that Democrats will flub a chance to turn Mr. Bush's
surrender on taxes into a potent political issue. He says
they can hurt Mr. Bush if they effectively contrast his
support for, say, gasoline-tax increases with his insistence
on cutting capital-gains taxes. "The danger to Bush comes if
the Democrats get smart and start defining just who Bush is
willing to tax and who he isn't," he says.
   "If the Democrats do that they make the issue take on a
political cost to Bush -- but these people seem to have lost
their political compass," Mr. Phillips adds.
