   TOKYO -- Nissho Iwai Corp., a leading Japanese trading
firm, is holding talks with Japan Airlines and Lufthansa
German Airlines to acquire a joint stake in DHL Worldwide
Express, the world's largest express-delivery service.
   A spokesman for the Japanese carrier confirmed that
Japan's largest airline is "studying a proposal to invest in
DHL" but refused to elaborate about the negotiations. DHL
Corp., based in Brussels, couldn't be reached for comment.

   According to Japanese news reports, JAL, Lufthansa and
Nissho Iwai would seek to increase any DHL holdings
gradually, acquiring a majority of DHL's stock by 1992. Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, reported that
the three firms are considering paying $500 million for a
stake in DHL. A final agreement on the plan among the three
companies is expected later this month.
   DHL would give the Japanese air-cargo carrier access to
the expanding freight business in Europe, analysts say. The
deal would mark Nissho Iwai's entry into the
document-delivery business.
   Analysts add that the Japanese-German link is an attempt
to counter the competitive threat of Federal Express Corp.,
which is aggressively expanding in Europe and in Asia.
