   MILAN, Italy -- Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co.'s manual
typewriters have been known for years throughout East Europe.
Now, with emerging democracies there pushing for
modernization, the company thinks the market is ready for its
personal computers, cash registers and other electronic
equipment.
   "We are planning to set up a joint venture in Hungary to
produce software, market our goods and provide servicing,"
says Ettore Morezzi, the senior Olivetti official responsible
for its East Europe strategy. The company also is planning
business ventures in Czechoslovakia.

   While politics kept out many Western companies during the
Cold War, such Italian giants as Fiat S.p.A. and the
state-owned holding companies Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi and
Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale continued to do
business there, particularly in the Soviet Union. Now,
Italian companies in everything from banking to heavy
industry are moving into Eastern Europe with little of the
hesitation of some of their Western competitors.
   Despite the enormous political and financial risks, they
are making major commitments in the region, hoping to cash in
on what they see as their national advantages: experience,
geographic proximity and exporting zeal.
   In Poland, for example, where Fiat cars have been
manufactured under license since the 1930s, Fiat is
negotiating to produce its new Tipo family car. In
Czechoslovakia, technicians from Manifattura Lane Gaetano
Marzotto &amp; Figli S.p.A. are working to modernize the
country's inefficient textile plants. And in Hungary, Banca
Commerciale Italiana is developing a financial-services joint
venture.
   "Italians have several unrelated advantages" over other
Western competitors, says Warren Oliver, an Eastern Europe
analyst at the London brokerage firm of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
"The small and medium enterprises in Italy are strong, making
a good partner for similar industries in the East. The
Germans are also strong in this area, but the Italians are
more export-oriented, and there is a reluctance (in Eastern
Europe) to stake everything on the Germans."
   Eastern European businessmen agree. "We know Italian
industry and the Italian market; there is a special climate
of cooperation," says Janusz Nogowczyk, a senior
foreign-trade official for Poland's Fabryka Samochodow
Malolitrazowych car group. Mr. Nogowczyk's company has been
producing the small Fiat 126 car since the mid-1970s, turning
out 200,000 a year.
   Making the most of those opportunities won't necessarily
be easy. One potential obstacle is funding. While in the past
some major Italian industrial projects have been paid for in
hard currency, many other ventures have depended on
countertrade agreements or the direct export of goods
produced. Such deals are relatively easy for large private
companies or state-backed enterprises but they are a headache
for smaller businesses.
   One sector where Italy traditionally has been a
particularly strong exporter, and where companies are braving
the obstacles to seize the advantage in Eastern Europe, is
the clothing and textiles business. Among the competitors is
Stefanel S.p.A., which three years ago opened a boutique in
Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, to sell women's fashions for
local currency.
   "We've been doing good business here," says a store
assistant, gesturing at the steady stream of customers. There
are gaps on many shelves, a sign of the difficulty of
matching supply with demand. A Stefanel spokesman explains
that deliveries are limited by a quota system set up under
the former Communist authorities, but he expects the problem
to be resolved soon. Stefanel recently opened a
local-currency shop in Budapest, the first of 10 stores it
hopes to launch in Hungary by the year end. The shops will be
operated on a franchise basis by Tradex, a private Hungarian
company.
   Rival Benetton Group S.p.A. also has stepped up its
presence. The company has 10 hard-currency outlets in Hungary
and smaller networks in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and
Poland, and it is looking to produce clothes in the Soviet
Union through a joint venture.
   And near Moscow's Red Square, two Florentine businessmen
are doing a brisk business in blue jeans. "We have opened a
factory in the Soviet Union, and sales are doing well," says
Alessandro Fratini, who with his cousin manages the Super
Rifle jeans company.
   Super Rifle started selling in Czechoslovakia 25 years ago
and began exporting to the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s.
Now, it has invested $70 million in a Soviet joint venture
that started producing jeans locally last December.
