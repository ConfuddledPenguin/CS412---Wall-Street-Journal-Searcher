   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp., trying to speed
the sale of real estate amassed from sick savings and loan
associations, said it will reduce prices on hard-to-sell
properties by as much as 20%.
   The S&amp;L bailout agency also announced a plan to sell about
$300 million in properties through a televised auction this
summer.

   The new policy allows the agency to reduce a property's
price by 15% after six months from the sales price originally
set by an independent appraiser. If the property still
doesn't sell after three more months, the price could be
trimmed another 5%. For residential property, the first
markdown could occur after four months.
   "We have become convinced that holding on to the property
is too expensive for the taxpayer," said William Seidman,
chairman of the RTC.
   The new policy is proof that the RTC hasn't roiled real
estate markets as earlier feared by dumping property at
below-market prices. Instead, Congress and the real estate
industry fret more about the so-called property "overhang"
that exists from the slow sales. "We originally said they
should be careful because they are going to hurt distressed
markets," said a spokeswoman for the National Association of
Realtors. "Now the thing has gone on for so long, we are just
glad to finally see something moving."
   The thrift-bailout law bars the agency from selling
property at below 95% of the market value in economically
depressed areas, mostly in the Southwest. The new approach
assumes that the market value is whatever price attracts
buyers -- not necessarily the value as determined by an
appraiser.
   The real estate -- the property held by savings and loans
that have been seized by the RTC -- currently totals about
$18 billion, or 10% of the RTC's total assets. The agency has
already sold between $2 billion and $3 billion of real estate
since last August. The rest of the RTC's asset inventory is
mostly mortgages, commercial loans, and securities. Its total
real estate portfolio could eventually surpass $100 billion
by the time it seizes the assets of all sick savings and
loans, the agency says.
   The sales policy is slightly different from what was
proposed two weeks ago when Robert Clarke, comptroller of the
currency, said he was concerned that slashing the property
prices would drive down the value of real estate held by
healthy financial institutions. The new policy calls for the
agency to monitor sales efforts by the independent brokers it
retains, before allowing the price to be reduced.
   The approach won't apply to residential property set aside
exclusively to be sold for low-income housing.
   The RTC also said it has retained Auction Company of
America, Miami, to hold its first real estate auction later
this summer, probably in Kansas City, Mo. Between $200
million and $300 million in property will be auctioned, with
each property valued at more than $1 million. It plans to
televise the auction to remote locations so that buyers from
around the country may bid.
   Property may be sold at the auctions for no less than 70%
of its appraised value. But the final price may be adjusted
to account for the savings to the government that would come
from selling the property and reducing its carrying costs.
