   Cambridge BioScience Corp. said it agreed in principle to
acquire a stake in Noctech Ltd., a maker of infectious
disease products based in Dublin, Ireland.
   A Cambridge BioScience spokesman said the company expects
to invest $750,000 to $800,000 in Noctech and to own "a
little less" than 20% of Noctech when the transaction is
completed.
