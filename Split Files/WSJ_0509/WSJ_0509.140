billion kronor ($195 million) from 609 million kronor ($100.8

   Ericsson's interim report exceeded market expectations and
the pretax profit was almost 280 million kronor above the
average prediction of analysts.
   The group said income per share after taxes and full
conversion leaped 88% to 17.25 kronor from 9.19 in the first
threemonth period last year.
   Ericsson said the improvement was attributable mainly to
the public telecommunications and radio communications
business areas, both of which posted a strong increase in
volume and favorable margin development.
