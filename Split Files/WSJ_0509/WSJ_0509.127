   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency issued a
rule for treating hazardous wastes that will cost industry
$350 million to $440 million annually, but environmentalists
claim the regulation is too lax.
   The rule, the last in a set of five regulations issued
since 1984, will demand the biggest expenditures from the
electric, gas and sanitary service industries, chemical
plants and petroleum refineries.

   The latest regulation, covering more than half of the
hazardous waste generated today, requires that contamination
by more than 300 chemicals, toxicity and other hazardous
characteristics be reduced before sludge or waste water can
be disposed of in landfills, deep wells or other facilities
by at least May 1992.
   The EPA said the rules will keep "significant quantities"
of hazardous wastes off the land, help prevent groundwater
contamination and encourage companies to reduce the amount of
wastes they generate. But environmental groups charged that
the agency buckled under to chemical and other interests by
setting standards that don't always require industry to use
the best available technology, such as incineration or
solidification techniques, to treat hazardous wastes before
disposal.
   Karen Florini, an attorney with the Environmental Defense
Fund, called the rule "extremely lax" and said the EPA is
"abandoning a golden opportunity for pollution prevention."
She said environmental groups are considering filing a
lawsuit.
   In writing the rules, the EPA was under pressure from both
industries that generate wastes and hazardous-waste treatment
companies that would have profited from tougher regulation.
