   HOUSTON -- A state court jury in Houston found that the
Dallas Morning News wasn't guilty of unfair competition when
it lured the rights to 26 Universal Press Syndicate features
away from its rival, the Dallas Times Herald.
   The decision is the latest bit of bad news for the
struggling Times Herald, which has been waging a circulation
and legal war with the larger Morning News, a unit of A.H.
Belo Corp., for years. Recently, the Federal Communications
Commission dismissed a related complaint in which the Times
Herald asked that Belo's Dallas television license be revoked
because of its agreement with Universal Press.

   The Times Herald, owned by closely held DTH Media Inc.,
sued its larger rival last year after Belo and Universal
Press, based in Kansas City, Mo., announced a joint venture
intended to explore electronic media possibilities for the
syndicate's features.
   But the agreement also gave Belo exclusive rights to
Universal Press features for the Morning News. As a result,
Universal notified the Times Herald that it couldn't run 26
features any longer, including popular comic strips such as
"Doonesbury" and "The Far Side" and columns such as "Dear
Abby" and Erma Bombeck. During the four-week trial, the Times
Herald claimed that its circulation declined after it lost
the features. The newspaper asked for $33 million in damages.
   "Since the beginning of this lengthy legal process, we
have said that the Times Herald's claims were totally without
merit and were undertaken solely for competitive reasons,"
Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a news release. "We are delighted that the
jury has heard the facts and vindicated our position."
   A spokesperson for DTH Media said the company wouldn't
comment on the verdict.
