   The fabled cashless society may have inched closer to
reality with an agreement by MasterCard International Inc.
and Visa U.S.A. Inc. to abandon their national debit-card
joint venture.
   The agreement -- part of a settlement of an antitrust
lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of 14 states -- calls
for the two credit-card companies to scuttle plans for a
joint, nationwide card that would have allowed consumers to
instantaneously deduct amounts from their bank-account
balances to purchase products. The suit alleged that the
companies violated antitrust laws in an effort to control the
debit-card market; the companies denied it.

   Several people familiar with the industry predict that,
with the lawsuit behind them, both MasterCard and Visa will
move quickly to introduce their own versions of the national
card. Competitive pressures, they argue, will force them to
resolve major hurdles that have impeded the development of
electronic point-of-sale payment systems, such as who will
pay for them and who will convince consumers that they really
want them.
   "This is the first important step in establishing a more
competitive environment in the nation's electronic payment
systems," said New York Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Denny D. Dumler, executive vice president of Rocky
Mountain BankCard System Inc., a Denver credit-card issuer,
agreed, noting: "When you only have one choice, you can wait
around and decide later whether to do it or not."
   Under the settlement, filed yesterday in federal court in
New York, MasterCard and Visa agreed to notify hundreds of
financial institutions that joined the program, called
Entree, that it will end Oct. 1. However, the program hadn't
been launched with retailers, so no consumers were actually
using the cards.
   A spokesman for New York-based MasterCard declined to say
how much money the two companies spent developing Entree
since the joint venture began in 1987, but said it was a
"significant amount," running into millions of dollars.
   "The American consumer is the real victim here. Even
though we feel that Entree would have prevailed in the
courts, the threat of long-term litigation caused banks to
lose interest in the program," said a spokesman for San
Mateo, Calif.-based Visa.
   Both companies said they plan to continue marketing their
separate debit products, MasterDebit and Visa Debit Card.
These have been available for several years but aren't
on-line systems. Merchants process these cards as if they
were credit cards, turn in their slips to the banks and later
receive their payments after the banks deduct the amounts
from consumers' bank accounts. Twenty million Visa Debit
Cards have been issued world-wide, including 6.8 million in
the U.S. MasterCard said it issued 1.3 million cards in the
U.S., according to figures compiled at the end of 1989.
   But the cards have several drawbacks. Banks that peddle
off-line cards risk overdrawn accounts, since the plastic
functions much like a check. For that reason, they typically
give the cards only to upscale customers. And they can't be
used in grocery stores, where consumers spend much of their
cash, because the stores' thin profit margins make
credit-card terminals uneconomical.
   In contrast, the Entree program would have provided direct
"on-line" access to a consumer's funds at the time of a sale.
Under the plan, for example, a Floridian vacationing in
California would eventually be able to use his automatic
teller card to purchase groceries or gasoline.
   And neither type of debit card provides a one-month grace
period before a payment is required, as credit cards do.
   Industry observers agree it will take a strong marketing
push from retailers and banks to prod the public into using
debit cards of any sort. In many ways, proponents face a
classic chicken-or-egg problem: Merchants won't install
costly hardware if there aren't many consumers with the
necessary plastic, and banks won't push the plastic if there
aren't many merchants accepting it.
   As for the buying public, "There isn't anywhere in the
country where consumers are running around with neon signs
saying, `I've gotta have on-line point-of-sale' debit cards,"
says Thomas Bennion, chairman of Florida Interchange Group
Inc., Orlando, Fla., which runs the Honor ATM network in
Florida.
   Just 4% of the nation's supermarkets accept debit cards,
according to Progressive Grocer, an industry magazine, up
slightly from 3% in 1988.
   Most on-line debit-card use is confined to regional
pockets. Although the cards have been modestly successful in
places such as California -- where Lucky Stores Inc., Dublin,
Calif., among others, markets them heavily -- they are
unknown in much of the country.
   Both Visa and MasterCard said they haven't made any final
decisions on creating their own "on-line" systems comparable
to Entree.
   The suit had alleged that the companies sought a
stranglehold on the national debit-card market -- without
actually putting the system in operation -- in order to
protect their own well-established credit cards from
competition. The states contended the companies would offer
their programs to retailers only if other companies tried to
break into the national market and threatened to cut into
credit-card purchases.
   The suit also charged that to prevent the entry of any
other competitors, Visa acquired control of Plus Systems
Inc., a national network of automated teller machines, and
Interlink Network, the nation's largest regional debit-card
network, and MasterCard acquired Cirrus System Inc., a
national automated-teller network. The suit sought to compel
the divestiture of Cirrus, Plus and Interlink.
   The states agreed to drop their opposition to those
acquisitions as part of the settlement. But if either company
acquires another automated teller or debit-card network, the
states would consider filing suit to seek divestiture, said
Lloyd Constantine, chief of the antitrust bureau in the New
York attorney general's office.
   As part of the settlement, the companies also agreed to
provide advance notice to the 14 states regarding any future
joint ventures into the debit-card industry or separate
debit-card programs that would permit a bank to be a member
of both MasterCard and Visa, among other circumstances. These
requirements are designed to give the states time to
determine whether antitrust suits should be filed.
   The states have also formed a Payment Systems Task Force
to oversee compliance with the agreement. Mr. Abrams said
concern about possible price-fixing in the credit-card
industry had emerged during the states' investigation and
that the committee will explore why interest rates and fees
charged to consumers for use of the cards are uniformly high.
   The American Bankers Association said the demise of Entree
was a setback for the debit-card industry. But in a written
statement, Entree Management Committee Chairman Douglas
Freeman said the program had helped create operation
guidelines that would aid the industry.

   RULING COMPELLING FIRMS to give business to lawyers gets
angry response.
   Employer groups are lobbying to override the Missouri
Supreme Court's recent decision requiring corporations to
hire attorneys in administrative appeals of
unemployment-compensation cases. In its ruling, the court
said individuals may act as their own legal counsel in such
appeals but corporations may not.
   "The law allows an individual to bear the risk that
representation without an attorney may entail," the court
said. But it added that corporations are creatures of statute
and, thus, are subject to various restrictions. "One such
restriction in Missouri is that a corporation may not
represent itself in legal matters but must act solely through
licensed attorneys," the court declared in an opinion by
Judge William H. Billings.
   The decision stems from a dispute between K mart Corp. and
Marjorie Reed, who was discharged by the company and filed
for unemployment benefits with the Missouri Division of
Employment Security. A division deputy upheld her claim,
prompting an administrative appeal by the company that was
handled by K mart's unemployment-compensation manager, who
isn't an attorney. The case wound up in the Missouri Supreme
Court, whose decision reversed a longstanding practice of
permitting non-lawyers to handle administrative appeals of
such matters.
   "It is axiomatic that a corporation must act through an
attorney in all legal matters," the court declared.
   While some lawyers contend the court simply is trying to
protect the public, business groups, such as the Missouri
Merchants and Manufacturers Association, contend the ruling
creates unneeded legal costs that will especially burden
small businesses. As a result of the ruling, the Missouri
Legislature is considering two proposals that would eliminate
the need for corporations to retain lawyers in administrative
cases.
   "It all boils down to economics," says a spokesman for
state Sen. Jim Mathewson, who introduced one proposal.
   The Missouri Bar Association opposed the legislative
moves, contending they infringe on the state Supreme Court's
right to decide what constitutes illegal law practice.
However, the association appointed a committee to review
current rules on when non-lawyers can appear in
administrative proceedings.

   MULHEREN'S LAWYERS are denied access to Boesky's overseas
bankers.
   Federal Judge Miriam Cedarbaum in New York denied a
request by John Mulheren's lawyers to seek pretrial testimony
from bankers and others abroad who the lawyers believe had
financial dealings with Ivan Boesky, convicted former
takeover speculator.
   Mr. Mulheren is scheduled to go on trial Monday in federal
court in Manhattan on charges of parking stock with Mr.
Boesky. Parking occurs when an investor sells securities with
the understanding that they will be repurchased, usually at a
prearranged time and price. The government has alleged Mr.
Mulheren used the tactic to conceal the true ownership of the
parked securities. Mr. Mulheren has pleaded innocent to the
charges.
   Thomas Puccio, a New York attorney for Mr. Mulheren, has
contended that as a witness against Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Boesky
will be "biased in favor of the government" because "the
government allowed Mr. Boesky to hold on to many millions of
dollars" after he paid a $100 million fine to settle charges
against him in 1987. Mr. Puccio sought to get testimony from
overseas bankers in an attempt to ascertain the extent of Mr.
Boesky's holdings abroad.
   Judge Cedarbaum said she rejected the request because Mr.
Puccio had presented no evidence that any financial
information the attorney was seeking would prove bias on Mr.
Boesky's part.
   Mr. Boesky is expected to be the government's star witness
in the case against Mr. Mulheren. Assistant U.S. Attorney E.
Scott Gilbert said that New York financier Carl Icahn may
also be called as a witness for the government in the case.
Mr. Icahn has never been a target of the investigation but he
was involved as an investor in one transaction that is a
subject of this case.
   Mr. Gilbert also said the government will drop one of the
42 counts in the indictment. The dropped count alleges that
Mr. Mulheren and his co-defendant, Leonard DeStefano,
illegally used the U.S. Postal Service to mail payments by
Mr. Mulheren's firm to Mr. Boesky for services that were
never provided by Mr. Boesky.

   RANDOM DRUG-TESTING of jail guards is upheld by New York's
highest court.
   In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of Appeals ruled
that New York City corrections officers' constitutional
rights aren't violated by random urinalysis drug-testing. In
reaching its decision, the majority balanced the officers'
Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy against the
government's need to control its prisons. The court cited a
drug-abuse problem among a significant number of the officers
as a compelling need for random testing.
   "By choosing to work in the paramilitary milieu of the
City Correction Department, guards voluntarily sacrifice
certain cherished freedoms," the court held.
   The dissent by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, however, argued
that the court had carved out a "general warrant permitting
the government to intrude in the most offensive manner."
   Judge Wachtler wrote: "Following this precedent, it would
be difficult to imagine how any officer, or anyone employed
in the world of law enforcement or even anyone associated
with the criminal justice system, would be free of the
requirement of random, suspicionless urine testing once
someone in authority found it desirable."
   The 10,000-member Correction Officers Benevolent
Association may seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court, says
Irving Anolik, the group's attorney.

   HARVARD LAW SCHOOL said Nomura Securities Co. of Japan
granted it $3 million to fund a professorship in
international financial systems. The professorship is
intended to advance the study of banking regulations and the
development of securities markets and new international
financial products, Harvard Law School said. The school added
that its dean, Robert C. Clark, is expected to name the
Nomura professor next fall.
