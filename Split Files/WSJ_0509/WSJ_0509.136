   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s senior debt to single-B-minus from
singleB-plus, and on subordinated debt to tripleC from
single-B-minus. About $187 million of debt is affected. S&amp;P
said the downgrade reflects the diminished business prospects
for the company's anti-viral drug, Ribavirin, coupled with a
major reduction in the Costa Mesa, Calif., company's research
and development commitment. "The downsizing of the Viratek
research unit, following the termination of clinical trials
to demonstrate the efficacy of ICN's anti-viral agent
Ribavirin against AIDS, limits prospects for the continued
commercial development of new therapies," S&amp;P said.
"Consequently, ICN will continue to be largely dependent on
biomedical products and pharmaceuticals that are not patent
protected for most of its revenues."
   An ICN spokesman said, "We believe that based on the
strength of our operating subsidiaries that the downgrading
of U.S. public debt is unwarranted. We plan to revisit the
issue again with Standard &amp; Poor's next year."
