   The University of Arkansas said it was notified by the
U.S. Patent Office that it will be issued a patent for
thallium-based superconductors discovered two years ago by
scientists at the school.
   A spokesman for the school in Fayetteville said the patent
is expected to broadly cover the thallium compounds, which
show superconductivity at the highest temperature known for
the phenomenon. Last year, International Business Machines
Corp. received the first patent covering certain thallium
superconductors.

   The IBM patent surprised experts in the field, for the
Arkansas scientists, Zhengzhi Sheng and Allen Hermann, were
widely regarded as the discoverers of thallium-based
superconductors. IBM's patent, however, covers only a narrow
range of thallium superconductor compositions.
   The expected broader Arkansas patent may set the stage for
a patent dispute between the school and IBM. The school
declined to comment on that possibility, and IBM executives
weren't immediately available for comment. Mr. Hermann, who
is now at the University of Colorado but stands to receive
part of the proceeds from commercialization of the patent,
said, "Now we have something to sell."
   A different high-temperature superconductor compound based
on the element yttrium earlier spawned a patent office
"interference" proceeding between IBM and three other
organizations claiming rights to the compound. Such disputes
involve sizable stakes -- Du Pont Co. in 1988 bought rights
to the University of Houston's patent applications on the
yttrium compound for $4.5 million.
   Controlling patent rights to the new compounds could
someday be worth far more than that. Superconductors conduct
electricity without resistance when cooled and promise
breakthroughs in electronics, power generation and other
technologies. Several of the new "high-temperature"
superconductors, which work when cooled with easily obtained
liquid nitrogen, have been discovered during the past four
years. A version of the thallium superconductor works at
minus 234 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the record for the
phenomenon.
