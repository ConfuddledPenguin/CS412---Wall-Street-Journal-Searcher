   DETROIT -- Comerica Inc. said it will build a $200 million
headquarters office in downtown Detroit on a site now
occupied by a concert hall named for Henry and Edsel Ford.
   The banking company said it is still working out financing
for the project, but expects to receive about $18 million in
loans for the project from the City of Detroit Downtown
Development Authority.

   Comerica will maintain an equity interest in the completed
development. The agreement also contains provisions that will
allow the development authority to receive a portion of the
building's cash-flow and sales proceeds revenue.
