   WASHINGTON -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. received a $823.5
million Air Force contract for F-15E aircraft.
   The F-15 has been a mainstay of McDonnell Douglas's
fighter fleet for nearly two decades, but the Bush
administration has proposed halting new orders after next
year. Work on this contract is to be completed in 1991.
