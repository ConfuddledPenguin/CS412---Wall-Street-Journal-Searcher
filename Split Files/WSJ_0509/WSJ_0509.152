   USX Corp. said it agreed to sell an oil and gas property
parcel of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. unit to Atlantic
Richfield Co. and Sonat Inc. for $193 million. The parcel is
one of seven USX has put on the block.
   The properties, located in Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma,
mainly in the Arkoma basin, were considered among the most
attractive. USX had hoped to sell all of Texas Oil &amp; Gas's
reserves in the first quarter, for about $1.5 billion.

   But the reserves couldn't be sold in one piece and had to
be parceled. USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said at the
company's annual meeting this week that he expected to sell
as many as four of the seven parcels.
   Pittsburgh-based USX said negotiations are continuing with
bidders on the other parcels. A closing on the Arkoma
property is expected in 60 to 90 days.
