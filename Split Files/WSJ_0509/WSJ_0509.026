   JAPANESE CONSUMERS `CAUTIOUS'

   Japanese consumers are becoming more cautious about the
future, Japan's Economic Planning Agency said.
   The agency said its quarterly survey conducted in March
showed that the index of consumer confidence, seasonally
adjusted, declined 1.8% from December.
   In compiling its data, the agency asked consumers whether
their standards of living improved, remained the same or
deteriorated over the three-month period and how they'll
change in the future. The results of the latest survey of
5,021 households showed that consumers are becoming more
cautious because of heavier interest burdens and declining
confidence in the country's economy.
   On a brighter note, the survey said consumers'
satisfaction with current incomes was greater than in the
last survey.
                                                                                                       

   A FIRING IN POLAND
                                                                                                       

   The Polish Ministry of Industry dismissed the director of
the state-run oil monopoly for contributing to havoc in
gas-station supplies, a ministry spokesman said. Jerzy
Szewczyk was fired for failing to predict a need to increase
crude-oil imports, said the spokesman. He said Mr. Szewczyk
had kept a relatively low supply of gas in Poland and hadn't
anticipated increased purchases last week as a result of two
holidays. Also, some Soviet gasoline bound for Poland is
refined in Lithuania, where Moscow's confrontation with the
independence-minded republic has interrupted exports.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN BREAKTHROUGH

   An Australian company that makes air-conditioning systems
said it has made a major breakthrough in the fight against
the killer Legionnaires' disease. John Dunshea, managing
director of the Melbourne-based Dynamag Pty, said the company
had developed equipment that prevented air-conditioning
systems from harboring dangerous levels of the bacteria that
cause the disease. He was quoted by the Australian Associated
Press as saying that the system, involving a magneto process,
was far more effective in killing the bacteria than any
current chemical treatment.
                                                                                                       

   REPAIRING A DANISH LANDMARK
                                                                                                       

   Copenhagen's City Council ordered urgent repairs to the
Danish capital's best-known tourist attraction: the bronze
statue of the Little Mermaid. Danish police said that a
seven-inch incision in the statue's throat, probably made by
a saw several weeks ago, was recently noticed by a passer-by
who reported it. The bronze harbor-side statue, inspired by a
Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, has suffered much at the
hands of vandals. Her head was cut off in 1964, she lost an
arm 20 years later and has been splattered with paint and
covered in graffiti.
                                                                                                       

   YUGOSLAVIA AND THE EC
                                                                                                       

   The president of Yugoslavia said his country's political
and economic reforms made it ready to join all major European
organizations, including the European Community. Janez
Drnovsek, addressing the parliamentary assembly of the
Council of Europe in Strasbourg, said Yugoslavia was prepared
for full membership in the 23-nation Council of Europe, the
12-nation EC, the six-nation European Free Trade Association
and the 24-nation Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development.
                                                                                                       

   ENLARGING SEOUL'S SUBWAY
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will borrow $500 million from Japan to finance
subway construction in Seoul, the official news agency said.
Japan agreed to lend the money at 4% annual interest for a
repayment period of 17 years, including a grace period of
seven years, according to Yonhap, the national news agency.
Yonhap quoted an unidentified official as saying the loan
from Japan's Overseas Development Association would be made
on condition that it be used to buy rolling stock and signal
equipment by international bids.
                                                                                                       

   MANILA GETS A BANK
                                                                                                       

   A California bank that allegedly was used by the late
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife to launder
stolen funds has been turned over to the Philippine
government.
   The transfer of all shares in the California Overseas Bank
of Los Angeles to the Manila government was part of a
plea-bargain agreement in U.S. District Court where Imelda
Marcos is on trial.
   The bank, estimated by a defense lawyer to be worth $20
million to $30 million, had pleaded guilty to one count of
wire fraud. Other counts involving federal bank-insurance
fraud and racketeering were dropped as part of the deal.
   The bank was owned by Robert S. Benedicto, a onetime
Marcos ally who was charged with conspiring to help the
former president shift stolen money to secret Swiss accounts.
Mr. Benedicto, also indicted by the U.S. District Court, was
dropped from the case as part of the plea-bargain
arrangement.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Officials investigating mysterious tremors that have been
shaking houses in the Japanese city of Kawasaki found the
cause wasn't earthquakes but rock fans jumping up and down at
a local nightclub. The local environment office ordered the
club to thicken its floors with concrete. . . . A boycott of
Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola to protest a doubling of the soft
drinks' prices is spreading throughout Turkey. The increases
are attributed to Turkish inflation, which currently runs at
an annual rate of around 65%.
