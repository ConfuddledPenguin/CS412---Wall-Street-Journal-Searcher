   NEW YORK -- Attracted by the highest yields in a year,
individual investors scrambled to buy record amounts of
three-year Treasury notes in an apparent bet that interest
rates are headed lower.
   Small investors snapped up 23% of the $10.57 billion of
three-year notes sold by the Treasury yesterday as it kicked
off the government's huge $30.5 billion quarterly auction of
notes and bonds.

   The three-year notes were sold at an average yield of
8.74%, the highest at a government auction since last May but
lower than some bond dealers had expected. The Treasury
received a record $2.45 billion in so-called "noncompetitive
bids," which come mainly from individuals. That topped by far
the previous record $1.75 billion in noncompetitive bids
received at the February 1989 three-year note auction, when
the issue yielded 9.18%.
   "It looks like retail investors are rushing to get good
rates before they drop any further," said Charles Lieberman,
a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
He said that after Friday's bond market rally, which pushed
Treasury yields as much as 1/4 percentage point lower, many
small investors "figured they had missed the top of the
market and realized they had better buy now." A week ago,
yields on actively traded Treasury bonds exceeded 9% but now
most are between 8.7% and 8.9%.
   Hours before the 1 p.m. EDT bidding deadline yesterday, a
line of investors snaked its way through a first-floor wing
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where bids are
placed for Treasury auctions.
   The rate on the three-year note is "pretty good right
now," said Richard White of East Rutherford, N.J., who was
waiting to submit his bid. "It's better than what you get at
the bank," said another investor, referring to his bank money
market account.
   At a time when many savings and loans are being taken over
by the government, and the credit ratings of some commercial
banks and corporations are eroding, some small investors are
turning to government bonds for safety as well as high
yields.
   "A three-year {Treasury security} is playing it safe,"
said Bob Bodin of New York City. "There are a lot of
conflicts in the economy. My guess is rates won't go much
higher. Rates, if anything, will go down."
   By submitting a noncompetitive bid, small investors agree
to accept the average price and yield determined by
competitive bidding that takes place among big Wall Street
bond dealers. Noncompetitive bids at the previous 12
three-year note auctions averaged $984 million, according to
Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., a subsidiary of John
Hancock Freedom Securities.
   The competitive bidding among bond dealers was aggressive.
The Treasury received 3.53 competitive bids for every one it
accepted, well above the average 2.90 bid-to-cover ratio at
the previous 12 three-year note auctions.
   Most analysts considered yesterday's auction a success.
However, they said that a good three-year note auction does
not necessarily mean that the remaining portions of the
three-part auction will go smoothly. The auction continues
today's with the sale of $10 billion of ten-year notes and
concludes tomorrow with the sale of $10 billion of 30-year
bonds.
   "It's misleading to believe that a successful three-year
auction will translate into successful 10-year and 30-year
auctions," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Maria
Ramirez Capital Consultants.
   Mr. Lieberman agrees. "The three-year auction was expected
to be the best spoken for, so I don't think the three-year is
a litmus test for the upcoming auctions," he said. Three-year
notes "are assets that are bought by bank trust departments
and individuals. The 10-year notes and 30-year bonds are
bought mostly by pension funds, insurance companies and large
Japanese investors."
   Japanese investors also snapped up large portions of the
new three-year notes.
   William Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa
Securities America Inc. estimates that Japan's four biggest
securities firms purchased about 30% of the new three-year
securities, including $2 billion purchased by his firm.
   "There was a mix of speculative and long-term investment
interest" by the Japanese, he said. Because all four brokers
have both Japanese and non-Japanese customers, it is
difficult to measure precisely the amount of securities
purchased by Japanese investors. Nonetheless, Japanese
clients are believed to be the mainstay of the four firms'
business.
   There was talk that First Boston Corp. was among the
biggest bidders at the three-year note sale. A top trader
there confirmed that his firm was active at the auction but
he declined to be specific.
   "We had as big a bid in the three-year note auction as we
ever had" for a sale of securities with that maturity, said
John Costas, co-manager of government trading at First Boston
Corp. He said his firm's robust bidding in part reflected
strong customer demand.
   First Boston recently revamped its government trading
operations by bringing in several former top bond trading
managers from Salomon Brothers Inc. The new team is led by
William J. Voute and E. Craig Coats Jr. Mr. Coats gained a
reputation while at Salomon Brothers for often being an
aggressive bidder at Treasury auctions.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices were modestly higher. The benchmark
30-year bond rose about 1/8 point, a gain of about $1.25 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   The benchmark bond was quoted late at a price of 96 16/32
to yield 8.82% compared with 96 11/32 to yield 8.84% on
Monday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted late yesterday
at a price of 97 21/32 to yield 8.84% compared with 97 19/32
to yield 8.85%.
   Short-term rates were little changed.
   In when-issued trading activity, the yield on the new
10-year notes to be auctioned today was 8.82%, down from
8.84% late Monday. The yield on new 30-year bonds, which are
scheduled to be auctioned tomorrow, was 8.80%, down from
8.82% late Monday.
   Here are details of yesterday's three-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated May 15 and mature May 15, 1993.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended 3/8 to as much as 3/4 point higher,
with the market showing a firmer tone, buoyed in part by the
successful Treasury note sale.
   In the new-issue municipal arena, strong investor demand
prompted underwriters led by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. to increase
the size of an issue of Denver airport system revenue bonds
to $700 million from $600 million.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 7.60% in 1995 to 8.67%
in 2023. The underwriters also restructured the deal, moving
bonds maturing in 2011 to 2012.
   Overall, more than $1 billion in new debt was priced
yesterday.
   A Chase Securities group won an issue of $185 million
Pennsylvania general obligation bonds. The bonds were priced
for re-offering to yield from 6.15% in 1991 to 7.25% in
2008-2010.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended 3/32 to 5/32 higher in light
dealings.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% issue for May
delivery ended at 94 17/32, up 3/32, its 9 1/2% issue at 97
1/32, up 5/32, and its 10% issue at 99 15/32, up 5/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue was quoted at
96 25/32, up 4/32.
   The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.94% to a 12-year
average life assumption.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   A robust run-up in zero-coupon junk bonds sparked gains
across the high-yield bond spectrum, prompting speculation
that the market may be ready for a sustained rally.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, advanced 1/4 to
1/2 point. The gains in the zero-coupon sector of the market
were the most striking.
   Among the star performers were zero-coupon bonds of
Hospital Corp. of America, which jumped one point to end at
65 1/2.
   Also higher were zero-coupon bonds of American Standard
Inc., Colt Industries Inc. and Fort Howard Corp. which
climbed about 1/2 point each.
   "When the zero-coupon market is up, it's encouraging,"
said Steven Shenfeld, a trader at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "Whether or not there's some broader trend,
it's too early to tell."
   Still, Shenfeld says "when people buy incremental yields
and volatility, it's a positive indicator."
   Zero-coupon bonds are highly volatile and tend to surge in
market upswings and plunge in market downturns.
   In the investment-grade corporate bond market, high-grade
issues were also stronger, gaining between 1/8 to 1/4 point.
   Paul Ross, a high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.,
said although there was strong interest in the zero-coupon
sector of the market, the buying continued to be selective.
   "There has been more active buying interest in the better
quality LBO issuers of zeros," Mr. Ross said.
   Because of their deferred interest features, zero-coupon
bonds are typically issued by leveraged buy-out junk bond
companies that seek to put off heavy interest payments during
the early years of an LBO.
   Since zero-coupon bonds are lower on a company's capital
structure and tend to be more risky, strength in zero-coupon
bonds is seen as a sign of investor confidence.
   "When you see a broad-based rally in the zero market, it's
a good indicator that the market is headed higher," said one
zero-coupon trader.
   In a research report released late last week, First Boston
Corp. said deferred interest securities like zero-coupon
bonds outperformed cash paying bonds during April.
   In addition, junior securities fared better than senior
securities last month, according to the First Boston report.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A three-day rally in the Canadian government bond market
came to a halt as prices fell about 1/2 point in light
trading.
   "There was a bit of a retrenchment in response to
{Monday's} rally and a bit of profit taking," one trader
said. The price of Canada's benchmark 20-year bond was as
much as 2 1/8 points higher on Monday.
   Traders said prices fell yesterday due to concerns about a
Canadian government bond auction set for tomorrow. Terms and
maturities of the bonds to be auctioned are scheduled to be
announced today.
   Yesterday's declines were a disappointment for some
investors who were hoping the Canadian bond market would
continue to recover from a long depression. Although Canadian
bond prices were higher last Thursday, Friday and Monday,
prior to that brief period prices had been falling for
several months due to an escalating dispute between the
Canadian government and the province of Quebec.
   The dispute involves a proposed constitutional amendment,
known as the Meech Lake accord. It was negotiated in 1987
and, if approved, would recognize Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada. Many Quebec politicians say they will
seek independence from Canada if the Meech Lake accord isn't
ratified by June 23.
   Meanwhile, Ford Credit Canada issued $100 million
(Canadian) of 13 1/8% five-year Eurobonds priced at 101.70 to
yield 13.17%. The issue, which was guaranteed by Ford Motor
Credit Co., a unit of Ford Motor Co., was managed by Wood
Gundy Inc.
