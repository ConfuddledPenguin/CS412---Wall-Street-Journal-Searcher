   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Buoyed by record-high exports,
the West German merchandise-trade surplus in March surged to
13.40 billion marks ($8.09 billion) from 10.63 billion marks
in February, according to the Federal Statistics Office.
   The March surplus exceeded economists' expectations of
11.5 billion marks for the month and surpassed the 12.8
billion mark surplus recorded by the Statistics Office for
March 1989.

   West Germany's current-account surplus also widened in
March to a preliminary 10.1 billion marks from a revised 8.1
billion marks the previous month, the Statistics Office said.
The February total was adjusted from the originally reported
8.3 billion marks.
   The current-account balance includes trade in goods, as
well as in services, plus certain transfers.
   West German merchandise exports totaled 60.95 billion
marks in March, up 17% from 52.02 billion marks in February.
The March figure surpassed the record of 60.8 billion marks
posted for June 1989.
   But March imports also rose, gaining 15% to 47.545 billion
marks from February's 41.39 billion marks.
   Meantime, in the first quarter of 1990, the West German
merchandise-trade surplus grew 2.5% to the equivalent of 36.9
billion marks from 36 billion marks in the year-ago quarter,
while the current-account surplus shrank 9.1% to 28.5 billion
marks from 31.1 billion marks in the first quarter of 1989.
