   NEW YORK -- Counsellors Tandem Securities Fund Inc. set
the price for its self-tender offer at $10.85 a share, or 95%
of the net asset value of its common at the close of business
Monday.
   The closed-end equity mutual fund is seeking as many as
two million of its 4.9 million common shares outstanding, and
as many as 303,030 of its preferred shares at $49.50 each,
plus an amount equal to accrued dividends. The preferred has
a liquidation value of $50 a share.

   The tender offer, which Counsellors Tandem's board
unanimously recommended shareholders reject, is being made as
part of an agreement with a large investor, Sequoia Partners
L.P. With other investors, Sequoia holds about 1.2 million,
or almost 26% of the fund's shares. Sequoia had been pressing
for measures to boost the fund's price, and had considered
replacing the fund's board.
   If more than 2.5 million common shares are tendered,
Tandem agreed to terminate the offer and hold a special
meeting to consider a binding proposal to liquidate. Tandem
will be required to support such a proposal under its
agreement with Sequoia. The self-tender offer began April 13.
An official of Tandem said it would be "inappropriate" to
disclose how many shares have been tendered so far.
   The offer expires at midnight tomorrow. Tandem doesn't
intend to extend the offer, but retains the right to do so at
a price equal to 95% of the net asset value at the close of
business three days before the then-scheduled expiration
date.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Counsellors Tandem shares closed at $10.25, unchanged.
