   Amphitheaters: Sony Corp.'s CBS Records Inc. set a joint
venture with Pace Group for the development of outdoor
amphitheaters and the creation of live-entertainment tours to
fill them. Closely held Pace operates amphitheaters and
produces such live events as tractor-pulls and rock concerts.
CBS Records said the venture also aims to supply music
recordings and videos of the performances it produces.
