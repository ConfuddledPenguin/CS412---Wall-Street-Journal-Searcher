   NEW YORK -- At first blush, the $1 trillion mutual fund
industry seems healthier than ever. Investors have continued
to pour money into stock and bond mutual funds despite
recently shaky securities prices, and the industry's assets
are now at an all-time high.
   But the champagne is unlikely to flow this week when 1,200
fund-industry executives gather in Washington, D.C., for
their annual shindig, the Investment Company Institute
general membership meeting.

   For although fund shareholders have remained tenacious in
their investing, it seems fund executives have been even more
bullish -- and now are starting to pay for their excesses.
   The problem is simple enough: The fund industry is
bringing out new funds faster than money is rolling in. That,
plus the recent slump in stock and bond prices, has meant
declining assets per mutual fund and hence lower profits for
the industry.
   Today, the average bond and income fund is 8% smaller than
it was at the end of 1985, and the average stock fund is only
11% larger. Money-market funds have made healthy gains in
assets, but these funds often aren't as profitable for the
fund-management companies.
   "In 1987 and 1988, we continued to see the introduction of
new funds," and they attracted healthy dollops of assets,
says Edward Mahoney, president of AMEV Advisers. "In 1989, we
still saw new funds, but they didn't get the assets that they
expected."
   Launching new funds is proving harder than ever, forcing
fund executives to advertise heavily, cut prices and merge
uneconomical funds. Once the dust settles, the big loser may
well turn out to be smaller fund groups that cannot afford to
compete. Fund investors stand to be the big winners,
benefiting from lower expense ratios and lower mutual fund
sales commissions.
   The motto among some large fund groups seems to be: Grab
assets at almost any price. In the no-load fund arena, the
most visible combatants are Dreyfus Corp. and Fidelity
Investments, which have been temporarily absorbing expenses
on some funds in an effort to get greater market share.
   After butting heads last year over money-market funds,
Dreyfus and Fidelity are at it once again, this time with
funds that seek to track the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock
market index. Dreyfus's Peoples Index Fund is absorbing all
expenses for the moment, while Fidelity's Spartan Market
Index Fund is holding down its expenses to 0.28% of assets
annually.
   Dreyfus has promised to absorb expenses until year end or
until the fund hits $100 million in assets, whichever comes
first. Fidelity says it will hold down expenses through May
1991.
   One potential loser in this price-cutting war is Vanguard
Group, which has long relied on its low expense ratios as its
principal marketing tool. "On the money-market side, it's
clear they have slowed our perennial gains in market share,"
says Vanguard Chairman John Bogle. He recently made a
much-publicized complaint to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, arguing that the 12-month yields being advertised
on some money funds were artificially high because expenses
were being absorbed and could be imposed at any time.
   As no-load funds absorb expenses to pump up returns,
broker-sold funds have been cutting commissions to pull in
new customers, and today few funds still charge the maximum
8.5% sales commission. Over the past year, large fund groups
such as American Funds Group, Putnam Financial Services and
Primerica Corp.'s majority-owned subsidiary, American Capital
Management &amp; Research Inc. have cut the loads on their equity
funds to 5.75%, at the same time introducing an annual "12b1"
marketing fee of 0.25%.
   The fight for assets is starting to punish profits. T.
Rowe Price Associates Inc., Colonial Group Inc. and American
Capital all reported stagnant earnings for the most recent
quarter compared with a year earlier, and Dreyfus's earnings
were down slightly.
   While price-cutting and ballooning advertising costs have
hurt profits at some large fund groups, they have also helped
these companies nab greater market share. According to a
recent research report from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., the
10 largest independent fund groups now manage 38% of the
industry's assets, up from 35% four years ago. The report
predicts that the market share of these 10 fund groups could
be as high as 45% by 1994.
   Some smaller players are finding they just can't afford to
compete. After 13 years of managing mutual funds, Bull &amp; Bear
Group Inc. put its fund business up for sale this past
January. "The giants of the business provide serious
competition, and we decided that we weren't well enough
capitalized to compete," says Chairman Bassett Winmill. The
fund group has received 280 inquiries from groups interested
in buying the $345 million, 10-fund family.
   Ivy Group has talked to some would-be suitors, though
Chairman Michael Peers says the firm has never actively
looked for a merger partner. Still, Ivy has clearly had
trouble pulling in new assets. In February, it closed down
its government bond fund, which had just $2 million in
assets. "It just hadn't taken off," says Mr. Peers. "We set
it up three years ago, and it just didn't go anywhere."
   Ivy's four remaining no-load funds -- three stock funds
and a money-market -- have fared only slightly better,
pulling in just $293 million despite producing excellent
returns for investors. "It could be competition, or it could
be that we're just not great marketers," says Mr. Peers. "I
look at these fund groups with records much poorer than ours,
and they're the ones pulling in the money."
   Because the mutual fund industry has historically enjoyed
such fat profit margins, the recent step-up in competition is
unlikely to force many fund groups to abandon the industry
altogether. "At the time of the '87 crash, mutual fund sales
dropped off and a lot of people were calling for mass
consolidation," recalls one analyst. "But even some of the
small mutual fund companies are still doing relatively well.
The margins are still pretty generous."
   Instead, analysts predict that fund groups will streamline
by merging small, unprofitable funds into larger, more
economical units or scrapping small funds altogether.
National Securities &amp; Research Corp. now is shrinking to 13
funds from 16, American Capital is in the process of merging
four funds and Boston Co. recently abandoned a yearlong
effort to sell four index funds.
   Fund mergers have an added advantage: They often provide a
way of burying pitiful performance records. At the end of
March, American Capital merged $39 million American Capital
Over-The-Counter Securities into $198 million American
Capital Venture. American Capital Venture had returned 49%
over the preceding five years; American Capital OTC had
returned just 5%.
   Expunging a bad record "is not the motivation for this
particular merger," says Don Powell, American Capital's
chairman. "We're merging smaller, high-expense-ratio funds
into larger funds."
   He adds, "I think {mergers} are a plus for shareholders.
They generally result in higher yields and lower expense
ratios."
