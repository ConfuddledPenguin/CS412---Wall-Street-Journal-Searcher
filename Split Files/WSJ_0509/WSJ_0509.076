   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Southam Inc. said it
swapped its 49% stake in North Shore Free Press Ltd., and
unspecified cash, for 63% of Lower Mainland Publishing Ltd.,
whose Vancouver-area papers had gross revenue last year of
about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$43 million).
   Specific terms weren't disclosed, and officials with
Toronto-based Southam, Canada's largest-circulation publisher
of daily newspapers, weren't immediately available.

   North Shore Free Press published the North Shore News, one
of 14 community papers that will now be operated by newly
formed Lower Mainland Publishing; Madison Venture Corp. owns
the remaining 37% of Lower Mainland Publishing. All but
Southam are based in Vancouver.
