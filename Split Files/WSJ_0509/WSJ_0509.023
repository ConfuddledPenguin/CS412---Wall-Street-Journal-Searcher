   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Yale University received a $20 million
gift from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, to establish
an Institute of Biospheric Studies, dedicated to research and
teaching on the global environment.
   The gift, the largest to the school in more than 20 years,
was presented by the third Bass brother, Edward P. Bass. Mr.
Bass graduated from Yale with a Bachelor of Science degree in
1968 and did graduate work in architecture there from 1968 to
1970. Over the years, the Bass family has given a number of
gifts to the school.

   Mr. Bass, who is chairman and chief executive officer of
the investment firm Fine Line Inc., is involved with a number
of environmental organizations and causes. He holds positions
as a director of the World Wildlife Fund, a member of the
board of managers of the New York Botanical Garden, and a
director of the Council of African Wildlife Foundation, among
others.
   Yale's faculty in biology, geology and geophysics,
forestry and environmental studies will provide the
institute's core academic resources, the school said.
   The gift will allow Yale to renovate academic facilities,
endow senior and junior academic positions and provide a $2
