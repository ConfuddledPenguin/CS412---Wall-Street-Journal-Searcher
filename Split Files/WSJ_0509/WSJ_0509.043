   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Standing on a pier in a replica of a New
England coastal village that until recently was a swamp, Jay
Stein points out a submerged mass of metal known as the blood
and meat machine.
   The executive behind MCA Inc.'s entry into the theme park
wars of Central Florida describes how this part of the "Jaws"
attraction spews realistic shark body parts and blood into a
large lagoon, then gathers up the debris within 40 seconds to
be ready for the next boatload of tourists. A short way
upstream, he explains, the shark will devour a boat and its
passengers. Rising to the surface amid the flotsam: A set of
mouse ears.

   Like MCA's soon-to-open Universal Studios Florida, Mr.
Stein projects an in-your-face aggressiveness that's striking
in this world so dominated by the soft contours of Mickey
Mouse. He's plainly obsessed: The project that he has dreamed
about for 20 years is finally materializing, with 2,000
construction workers swarming over 200 acres in three shifts
for 24 hours.
   The floating ears are a clear reminder that the fierce
competition between MCA and Walt Disney Co. is about to play
itself out in yet another arena. The stakes are high for MCA,
not least because it and a partner have spent $630 million to
compete with the multibillion-dollar Walt Disney World just
minutes down the interstate. The success of Universal
Florida, MCA's first theme-park foray outside California,
will be the acid test for MCA's plans to build as many as
four more parks.
   MCA can't seriously pretend to compete with Disney World
as a whole, which sells an estimated 30 million tickets a
year and serves as a mecca for what sometimes seems like a
national religion. MCA is taking on one part of that empire,
the popular Disney-MGM Studios tour, whose opening was
heavily promoted last year by Disney and in advertisements
for Chevrolet Lumina cars.
   Some early visitors to Universal Florida are bullish.
Harold L. Vogel, the senior entertainment analyst at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., predicts that the new MCA park will slow down
the growth in attendance at Disney World. Visitors just might
take one day out of their Disney stay to visit the new
neighbor. "I think you'll be surprised how many people
staying on the Disney property will visit Universal," says
Mr. Vogel, who toured the park last week.
   One possible concern: If it turns out that Disney's secret
all along has been its credo of letting visitors "discover
the child within themselves," Universal Florida could be in
trouble. Instead of shouts of "How cute," the cries here may
be bloodcurdling. Instead of excursions with cuddly Mickey,
Donald and Kermit, visitors will encounter Kongfrontation,
Earthquake and the shower scene from "Psycho."
   The push now is to get the word out about Universal
Florida. MCA doesn't have Disney's marketing budget, which
Mr. Stein estimates at $100 million for Disney-MGM before it
opened, a figure that Disney won't confirm. MCA will spend
about $50 million before the June 7 opening and $110 million
by the end of the year, including cross-promotions with
sponsors such as PepsiCo Inc., Hertz Corp., Arby's Inc. and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which are providing more
than half the budget.
   As a result, MCA's strategy is heavily geared toward
billboards and other media in Florida to grab folks already
here, not toward national television buys. MCA is also
charging a slightly lower price: Adult admission is $29,
compared with $31 a day at each of Disney's three parks.
   Disney has already responded to the threat from MCA by
doing a hard sell for the mushrooming number of hotels on its
own 28,000-acre property and by eliminating the former
two-day and three-day park passes for four-day and five-day
passes when it opened its studio tour. It also reversed an
age-old policy of refusing to allow travel agents to take
commissions on ticket packages to Disney World, and it's
telling visitors staying there that renting a car "usually"
isn't necessary.
   MCA executives acknowledge that they plan to feed off
Disney customers, who have made this area the nation's
biggest tourist destination. But they're also bent on forging
an identity for Universal Florida.
   "No one's had the courage to compare us with Disney,"
complains Mr. Stein, president of MCA's Recreational Services
division. The comparison that he'd like people to make is
that the Universal tour is bigger than Disney-MGM, even
though it cost about the same to build, that characters such
as E.T. and the ghouls from Ghostbusters are at least as
compelling to young children as Minnie and Goofy, that the
food will be better, and that the rides are more thrilling.
In the Kongfrontation ride, for instance, a 13,000-pound
gorilla hurls a passenger-filled aerial tram 30 feet in
apparent free fall.
   To Mr. Stein, Universal Florida is more than a mere
amusement park. Pointing to an artist's rendering of it, he
says, "The last thing you'd call that is a theme park. It's
not a theme park, it's a factory."
   That remark goes to the heart of MCA's struggle to carve
its niche. Universal Florida, executives chant repeatedly, is
a real working studio, where film makers actually shoot
movies and TV shows; their not-so-subtle corollary is that
Disney's production facilities are mere window dressing.
   Disney has three smallish sound stages (30,000 square
feet) plunked in the middle of its studio tour, home to a
game show and a series for the Disney Channel. While Disney
says it will expand its production facilities, Universal
already has six stages (more than 100,000 square feet) that
will be the headquarters for Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon cable
network and other projects. "Parenthood" was made here, and
Mr. Stein says he'll rope off sections of the park any time
that a film maker wants to shoot a movie.
   Universal Florida does indeed look like a studio lot, with
industrial-looking buildings looming by a New York set, San
Francisco's waterfront, the New England town of Amity, and a
1930s-style Hollywood. Mr. Stein estimates that the lot takes
two days to really explore. Disney-MGM takes a day at most.
   Walt Disney Attractions President Richard A. Nunis is
unconcerned about the larger production facilities. "We'll
wait and see how they'll do the first year. Our stages are
full, our guests are very happy and we have additional stages
in design," he says.
   MCA recently started opening the park to selected guests.
Analyst Richard Simon of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. says he thinks
MCA's attraction will be "exceedingly competitive" with
Disney's studio tour, with a chance of reaching six million
visitors a year; Disney-MGM has been host to an estimated
eight million in the past year. "MCA has rethought the studio
tour business. What they've built is fundamentally different
from Disney, and it could pull attendance away," Mr. Simon
says.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Stein stalks the still unfinished park: "I
go crazy over the details." As he passes a rickety boathouse
being hauled by a huge truck to the edge of the lagoon, a
design specialist explains that when stuntmen blow it up, the
flames will shoot 40 feet into the sky. "It'll be 70 feet or
I'll kill someone," Mr. Stein confides later. "I want it
twice as high as the one down the street," he adds, referring
to Disney-MGM's explosion-filled Indiana Jones stunt show.
   MCA's Florida attraction is nothing like its 25-year-old
Hollywood studio tour. Built on hilly terrain around an
existing movie studio, Universal Hollywood has to transport
visitors in trams, for example. Mr. Stein hates trams because
people can't spend money when they're captive riders. He
chortles that Disney installed a tram tour as part of
Disney-MGM, something he thinks shows that Disney rushed
pellmell to open its movie park by copying even the bad parts
of Universal Hollywood. "It's as if you gave someone a
Persian rug and told them to reproduce it, and they did,
cigarette burns and all," he says. "We thought trams were the
way to go," retorts Disney's Mr. Nunis.
   Clearly, MCA hasn't gotten over the Jaws vs. Mickey
"feud," in which MCA accused Disney of stealing the plans for
Universal Florida and then getting a year's jump on MCA by
building its own movie-based theme park -- a charge that
Disney calls absurd, saying that Walt Disney himself planned
a studio tour in the early 1950s. Pumping up the feud may
suit MCA's purposes: It makes people discuss the two
companies in the same breath.
   MCA has a lot riding on being treated as a serious player
in the theme park business, especially now that other major
studios are dipping their toes in the water, such as Time
Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., which acquired a stake in the Six
Flags amusement park chain last month.
   MCA is close to a decision about building a new theme park
in England or France with its Florida partner, Rank
Organisation PLC. It has a deal with Nippon Steel Corp. for a
park in Japan. Mr. Stein also discloses that there are plans
for a separately ticketed park next to the Orlando
attraction, then a copy of it somewhere in Southern
California, but he declines to be more specific.
   For now, anyone who's ever had a kitchen remodeled can see
that construction at Universal Florida won't be finished when
the public starts filing in. But given his long odyssey, Mr.
Stein doesn't fret that for the first few weeks, burly guys
in hardhats may be mingling with visitors.
   "I see it," he says brazenly, "as a picture-taking
opportunity."
