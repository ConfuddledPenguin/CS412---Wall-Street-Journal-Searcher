   GORBACHEV DEMANDED a restructuring of the Soviet Union's
armed forces.
   As the military prepared to parade its might in cities
across the country today to mark the Soviet victory over Nazi
Germany in World War II, the Kremlin leader told a gathering
of senior officers and veterans that Moscow's leadership was
"far from being satisfied with the current situation in the
army." He said proposed legislation to revamp the armed
forces is under consideration. Despite fresh challenges from
pro-independence Baltic republics, Gorbachev rebuffed calls
from military hard-liners for a firm hand against
"anti-socialists."

   A FIRE ERUPTED aboard a Navy guided-missile destroyer,
killing a sailor.
   In the first major accident at sea since a series of
incidents prompted a two-day review of naval safety
procedures last fall, a fire broke out in the boiler room of
the USS Conyngham about 80 miles off North Carolina,
spreading to an area that houses the ship's sonar and radar
operations. At least 12 sailors were injured in the blaze,
which temporarily left the 27-year-old vessel "without
communications and dead in the water," a White House
spokesman said.
   The Navy said a crew member aboard an air-cushioned ship
that was traveling near Virgina Beach was killed when a
propeller malfunctioned.

talks on German integration.
