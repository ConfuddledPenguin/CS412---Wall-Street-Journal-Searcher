   The G-7 nations have agreed to boost IMF resources by 50%,
to $180 billion, but Third World nations are grousing
nonetheless. If the new credit is siphoned off to Eastern
Europe, Zimbabwe's finance minister warns us to expect a
"very explosive and dangerous situation . . . conditions
likely to undermine international peace and security."
   Don't lose sleep over that threat. The peoples of the
Third World seldom see the IMF money funneled to their
governments and are not likely to take up arms because their
oligarchies have less to salt away in Swiss bank accounts.
But it is true that the IMF quota increase got a big boost
from the changes in Eastern Europe. Western governments seem
to feel that they should be doing something. In the absence
of any concrete strategy, building up multilateral
institutions is a natural response.

   To be sure, the multilaterals talk a lot these days about
their new focus on financing private entrepreneurship and
promoting market economies. But it is virtually impossible
for them to funnel credit into a country other than through
government bureaucracies. Public finance and private
initiative seldom make a good economic brew. The Housing and
Urban Development scandal, among others, testifies to that. A
U.N.-sponsored study by East European economists concluded
last month that building market economies will depend not so
much on credit as on creating new legal structures and market
skills.
   Some of the people who know state banking best are already
pursuing this course. In January, Czechoslovakia moved to
rejoin the IMF specifically asking for technical aid, not
cash. In April, a blue-ribbon commission of leading
Hungarians published the results of their future economic
course. It stressed private investment, not loans from bodies
such as the IMF.
   The Hungarians in particular should know that the IMF can
unwittingly set back the cause of reform. Hungary's high
per-capita indebtedness is attributable in part to the
generosity of the IMF and World Bank. Its Communists loved
the Western largesse because it helped keep them in power
during those many years that preceded their ultimate
downfall. But today, a free Hungary wants its smartest people
in the private sector, not in state bureaucracies.
   We suspect that the fears of Third World oligarchs are
unwarranted. Their money will continue to come through. The
IMF was created at Bretton Woods to finance
balance-of-payments adjustments under fixed exchange rates,
but long ago turned to financing efforts to restructure the
debts and economies of debtor nations. Today, at least some
national leaders, such as Jamaica's Michael Manley, are
promising to abandon socialism in return for new aid. But
there remains the contradiction inherent in trying to
stimulate private enterprise with public money.
   If the industrial nations continue creating the credit,
there will always be countries wanting to use it. Zimbabwe's
threat of violence if the credit tap is shut off made that
point quite clear this week. However, credit resources
world-wide would be more effectively employed if more nations
followed the lead of Czechoslovakia and Hungary and focused
more on free markets and less on Western aid.
