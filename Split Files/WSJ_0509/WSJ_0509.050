   When Landmark Land Co. announced plans last month to sell
a substantial portion of its real estate for $967 million, it
seemed to some real-estate analysts that the deal was too
good to be true. They may have been right.
   Carmel, Calif.-based Landmark said the Office of Thrift
Supervision objected to the financing for the sale of its
resort and real-estate properties to California developer
Barry G. Hon. Landmark said it would try to propose a new
deal, which could include Mr. Hon acquiring new partners or
additional lenders.

   Real-estate analysts were skeptical the deal could be put
together again at the same price, however.
   "Landmark was trying to show a real big gain by boosting
its capital position," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria,
Va.-based financial institutions consultant. "Now, if they
have to go to a third party to sell, they won't be able to
show nearly the gain."
   The sticking point for the OTS was that the sale, 75% of
which was to be financed by Landmark's Oak Tree Savings unit,
would have committed about 20% of Oak Tree's assets to one
borrower. It wasn't clear how Mr. Hon, a Southern California
developer, would finance what remained of the acquisition.
   The Landmark sale was triggered by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989,
which increased the amount of capital that savings and loan
associations needed to stay in the real-estate business. As a
result of the act, a number of S&amp;Ls have sold their real
estate at deflated prices.
   Landmark's real-estate holdings are owned through Oak
Tree, which is based in New Orleans. In April, Landmark said
it would realize a pretax profit of $470 million if the
entire transaction were completed.
   Landmark, a thinly traded land and golf-course development
company, is 28%-owned by Gerald G. Barton and 24% owned by
Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which is
controlled by the Reichmann brothers.
   Landmark officials say they believe the deal will be
salvaged. "There are several things Mr. Hon can do," said Mr.
Barton, Landmark's chairman. "He can find partners, raise
more equity or have one of his own banks finance part of it.
I feel pretty confident he will do one of those things."
   Bruce Tester, an attorney for Mr. Hon, said Landmark would
soon discuss the matter with OTS officials and try to
reconfigure the sale.
   While Mr. Barton said he was surprised by the OTS finding,
Wall Street apparently was already skeptical that the deal
would be completed. The day the proposed transaction with Mr.
Hon was announced, the stock opened at $17.50 a share, and
has fallen steadily ever since. In American Stock Exchange
Trading yesterday, Landmark stock dropped $1.875 to $10.375.
   "The stock price is telling us this deal has long odds of
happening," said Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit
Investments Inc., a Montvale, N.J., advisory concern that
follows real-estate companies. "In today's real-estate
market, it was always a very speculative deal."
