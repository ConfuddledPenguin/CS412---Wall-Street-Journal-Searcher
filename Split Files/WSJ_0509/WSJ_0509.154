   Tokyo stocks managed to close slightly higher, as a
tug-of-war between bargain hunters and profit-takers kept
activity buzzing, participants said.
   Meanwhile, London stocks ended moderately higher, fueled
to a degree by thin trading conditions and overnight gains on
Wall Street.

   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 14.31 points to
30970.58, after advancing 782.63 points Monday.
   At the end of the morning session in Tokyo Wednesday, the
Nikkei index was down 121.72 points to 30848.86.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 750
million shares, up from 617.43 million shares Monday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section added 7.11 points, or 0.31%, to 2303.60. The
index advanced 48.68 points Monday.
   The second section index, which gained 48.40 points
Monday, leaped ahead 43.52 points, or 1.20%, to close at
3671.88. Volume was estimated at 14 million shares, up from
8.97 million shares.
   Although the Nikkei index gained an unimpressive 14
points, the day's constant activity was interesting, perhaps
more so than Monday's 783-point rally, said Minami Omura, a
PaineWebber Inc. broker.
   Monday morning's trading began with a 200-point
retracement on the Nikkei, as dealers and investment trust
funds, convinced that the market's short-term rally would end
soon, initially took profits.
   But this outlook was met by new bullishness by individual
investors, who felt confident that the Nikkei index has begun
a recovery, traders said. Monday's gain marked the first time
this year that the Nikkei index has risen for five
consecutive sessions.
   Moreover, brokers seeking to dress up accounts for
customers who've sustained heavy losses on issues bought at
the market's December peak contributed to brighter
sentiments.
   More issues gained than lost, as advancing issues clearly
outpaced losers 622 to 338, with 145 issues unchanged.
   In addition, the yen's steady movements, while not
particularly encouraging, at least weren't a hindrance to
positive sentiments in the equity market, traders said.
   Ms. Omura noted that Sunday's communique by the Group of
Seven industrialized nations, which stressed the need for the
yen's stability in light of global economic adjustment,
hasn't yet had much of an impact on the yen or, indirectly,
on stocks.
   Likewise, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said
after a cabinet meeting that he's watching the longer-term
effects of the communique, rather than the short-term
effects.
   Meanwhile, the market apparently lacks a leading sector,
and is motivated more by rumors and corporate earnings
results, traders said.
   One unconfirmed rumor that Morinaga Milk Industry would
merge with Morinaga &amp; Co. sent the milk company's stock
sharply higher, closing at its stop-high, traders said.
   Other food shares didn't follow, as the sector is regarded
"as a lackluster area of the market right now," said Kevin
Haag, a trader in overseas operations at Nomura Securities
Co.
   Mr. Haag said that the food sector is likely to be
overshadowed by the high growth prospects of constructions,
shipbuilders and transportations.
   Stocks within the railroads and real estate sectors were
of particular interest to bargain hunters, Ms. Omura noted.
   Keisei Electric rose 80 yen to 1830 yen (51 cents to
$11.57), Tokyu added 90 yen to 1740 yen and Odakyu rose 20
yen to 1260 yen.
   Mitsui Real added 30 yen to 1860 yen, Mitsubishi Estate
was up 40 yen to 1700 yen and Sumitomo Realty gained 50 yen
to 1570 yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share
index gained 19.8 points to 2182, off the intraday peak of
2192.3 at midday, but firmer than the day's low of 2173.3 at
the opening of trading.
   The Financial Times 30 share index rose 13.3 points to
1710.1. Volume was 309 million shares, down from Friday's
equally thin 437.5 million shares. The market was closed
Monday for a holiday.
   In the futures markets, the June Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 stock-index contract closed at 2211, unchanged
from Friday.
   Dealers said the market came off its midday peak for two
main reasons. Firstly, market makers sought to cap the
advance to prevent the market from moving too quickly ahead
and to keep prices around what dealers suggested were more
manageable levels in terms of buyer interest. Secondly, short
covering in the early going, which was prompted in part by
Wall Street's advance, began to evaporate as the market
climbed to its intraday peak.
   A dealer with one large London brokerage noted that the
market, nevertheless, is "well based at these levels." He
added that equities are gaining some support from reduced
jitters over the stability of the Conservative-led
government, particularly following this past week's local
elections in Britain.
   Among the FT-SE 100 stocks, seven were unchanged, 83
gained and 10 retreated.
   The biggest mover was General Universal Stores, while the
biggest loser was Reuters, falling 5 pence to #11.19 (8 cents
to $18.68).
   General Universal and Whitbread were pushed higher by
local reports suggesting the European Community plans to make
all classes of shares equal. General Universal ordinary
shares rose 13 pence to #13.63 and the Class A shares
increased 37 pence to 967 pence. Whitbread's Class A shares
jumped 10 pence to 379 pence and the Class B shares were
unchanged at #12.50.
   In the midst of the thin trading volume, Hanson edged up 2
pence to 214 1/2 pence on a relatively heavy 10 million
shares traded and British Telecom rose 12 1/2 pence to 262
pence on trading of six million shares.
   Meanwhile, stocks closed lower in Frankfurt and Zurich;
mixed in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan; and higher in Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed firmer.
   Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Seoul, Manila and
Taipei, were mixed in Hong Kong and Singapore, lower in
Wellington and little changed in Sydney.
