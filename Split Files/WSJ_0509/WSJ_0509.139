   Atlantic Richfield Co. said the British government
approved the Los Angeles-based company's plans to develop the
Pickerill Field in the U.K. North Sea, clearing the way for
the sale of the natural-gas field's entire output to
PowerGen.
   PowerGen is one of two generating companies formed by
Britain to succeed the state-owned Central Electricity
Generating Board, which Britain is taking public. Arco
declined to disclose the cost of the project, but the British
government said it is about #200 million ($334 million).

   Pickerill Field, located about 40 miles off the
Lincolnshire coast in the North Sea's southern basin, has
estimated gas reserves of 750 billion cubic feet. Production
is set to begin in 1992, at a maximum rate of 210 million
cubic feet a day.
