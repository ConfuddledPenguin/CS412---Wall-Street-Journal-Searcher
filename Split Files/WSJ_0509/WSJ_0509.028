   A new diet study concluded it makes little difference
whether people trying to lower their blood cholesterol levels
use olive oil or corn oil in a low-fat diet.
   The study challenged earlier findings that oils rich in
monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, are preferable in
"heart healthy" diets to oils rich in polyunsaturated fats,
such as corn oil. But a nutrition scientist who conducted
some of the earlier experiments said good reasons still exist
to opt for the olive oil-types of fats in "heart healthy"
diets.

   The terms, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, refer to
the fats' chemistry, specifically to whether the carbon atoms
in the fats are saturated with hydrogen atoms. Fully
saturated fat, such as that in meat and dairy products, is
believed to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the
risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks. Cutting
back on total fat in the diet and substituting unsaturated
fats found in vegetable oils for the saturated animal fats
lowers blood cholesterol levels and reduces heart-disease
risk.
   The study, reported in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, was designed to find out whether there
is any difference between monounsaturated fats and
polyunsaturated fats on blood cholesterol levels. The
experiment particularly aimed at finding out whether the
monounsaturated fats have a more favorable effect than the
polyunsaturated fats on the levels of HDL cholesterol, the
"good" form believed to protect against coronary heart
disease.
   Funding for the study was largely from federal grants but
included a gift from the Best Foods division of CPC
International Inc., maker of Mazola corn oil. Researchers
said the "no-strings-attached" Best Foods gift was sought
only after the experiment had been designed and was getting
under way.
   The experiment was carried out jointly by researchers at
the Stanford University medical school in Palo Alto, Calif.,
and the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratories in Berkeley, Calif.
   The research team asked each of 39 men and women from a
Mormon community near San Francisco to spend 24 weeks eating
a diet in which only 30% of the calories came from fats, as
recommended by the American Heart Association. The Mormons
were picked because they abstain from smoking, coffee and
alcohol, all of which can affect cholesterol levels.
   During one 12-week period, the volunteers prepared and ate
at home a diet in which only 10% of the calories came from
saturated fat and 20% of calories came from safflower-oil and
corn-oil products that are rich in polyunsaturated fats. The
volunteers then switched to a diet in which olive and peanut
oil products, which are rich in monounsaturated fats, were
substituted for the safflower-oil and corn-oil products.
   Nutritionist Darlene M. Dreon and her colleagues said they
found no significant differences in the effects of the two
types of diets on cholesterol levels. They particularly noted
that there was no difference in the levels of the "good" HDL
form of cholesterol. Thus, they concluded, there didn't seem
to be any advantage in using monounsaturated fats instead of
polyunsaturated fats in low-fat diets, at least not for
Americans who shop at grocery stores and eat at home instead
of consuming special fat-modified foods in a nutrition
laboratory.
   But in Dallas, Scott M. Grundy, the University of Texas
nutrition scientist whose experiments have boosted the case
for monounsaturated fats, said the California experiment
wasn't as much of a challenge to monounsaturated fats as it
appeared.
   Dr. Grundy explained that past experiments have indicated
that if the low-fat diet includes a large proportion of the
polyunsaturated fats there will be a worrisome drop in the
levels of the "good" HDL cholesterol. Such an unfavorable
drop isn't seen when the diet includes a large proportion of
monounsaturated fats instead, he said. This is one reason
heart researchers have been backing off from earlier
recommendations that Americans switch to the polyunsaturated
fats found in corn and safflower oils.
   The Texas scientist said the differences in the fat
content of the two diets in the California experiment weren't
large enough to produce a detectable effect on the
HDL-cholesterol level. He added there are other reasons to
advocate monounsaturated fats over polyunsaturated fats,
including hints that the polyunsaturated fats may encourage
the development of gallstones.
