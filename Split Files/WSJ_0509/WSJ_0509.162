   WASHINGTON -- The House passed a bill directing the
Securities and Exchange Commission to improve coordination of
the clearance and settlement of stocks and related financial
instruments.
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, is a reaction to
the October 1987 stock-market crash. Studies show that
trading during the crash strained the back-office payment
systems for stocks, options and futures.

   The bill doesn't specify how the clearing and settlement
functions are to be linked, but directs the SEC to report
back to Congress within two years.
   The SEC backs the legislation, and a similar provision is
included in the Senate's pending market-revision bill.
