   Gibson Greetings Inc. said the recent bankruptcy-law
reorganization filing of Ames Department Stores would lower
its second-quarter earnings due to an unspecified charge for
bad-debt provisions.
   Cincinnati-based Gibson said its Cleo Inc. greeting-card
subsidiary, which shipped merchandise to Ames last fall, was
a creditor in the Ames bankruptcy-law proceedings. The amount
of the charge has not yet been determined, Gibson said, due
to insufficient information concerning the financial status
of Ames.

   Gibson noted, though, that the additional bad-debt
provision is expected to have a relatively minor impact on
its full-year results.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Gibson had net income of $2.6
million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $66.1 million.
For all of 1989, earnings were $42.4 million, or $2.68 a
share, on revenue of $465.3 million.
