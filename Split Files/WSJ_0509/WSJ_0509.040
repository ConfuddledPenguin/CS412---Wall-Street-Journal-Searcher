   LOS ANGELES -- A federal court judge here sentenced Robert
Fine Jr. to four years and two months in prison for a loan
scheme in which he fraudulently assumed property owners'
identities and used their property as loan collateral.
   Mr. Fine, a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident, pleaded
guilty in February on one count of mail fraud and one count
of using a fictitious name. Mr. Fine served time in prison
after his conviction in November 1987 on similar loan-fraud
charges.

   His latest conviction was for bilking two home-loan
companies out of $613,000. Mr. Fine scouted for vacant,
unencumbered properties in real-estate records and used the
data to obtain credit reports on the owners. With the credit
reports, he applied for loans using the owners' identities.
   Mr. Fine was also sentenced to three years of probation,
fined $6,820 and ordered to pay $57,173 in restitution to one
of the defrauded lenders.
