   CPT Corp. (Eden Prairie, Minn.) -- President and chief
executive officer of 12 months, David Clinton, resigned but
will work as a part-time consultant as the
office-automation-equipment concern continues a restructuring
aimed at restoring profitability, the company said. It also
said its board appointed an executive committee of four
directors to oversee turnaround efforts.
