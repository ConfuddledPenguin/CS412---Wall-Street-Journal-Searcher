   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. succeeded in limiting an increase
in the resources of the International Monetary Fund, but it
had to agree to advance by two years the date for the next
review of the institution's funds.
   The 50% increase approved by the fund's policy-making
Interim Committee should ensure that the IMF can assist
economic overhaul in developing countries and in Eastern
Europe. It means that the IMF will have about $180 billion in
resources compared with about $120 billion now.

   The U.S. and some other nations, including Britain and
Saudi Arabia, had sought an increase of 35% or less in IMF
resources, which are called quotas. The IMF, France and
developing countries had supported a 100% increase. The next
review of the IMF resources will begin in March 1993 -- not
in 1995 as the U.S. had wanted. U.S. officials, however,
stressed that the current review took two years and that a
future review might take as long.
   "It's a compromise, everyone had to give a bit," said
Canada's Finance Minister Michael Wilson, chairman of the
Interim Committee. "I think we all realized if we couldn't
get agreement on this we'd have to go another six months"
with the matter unsettled, he added.
   In its communique, the Interim Committee also said that
progress toward "the single European market in 1992, the
prospective unification of Germany, and successful reforms in
Eastern Europe will strengthen the outlook for economic
growth." But the panel warned that "substantial efforts must
be made" to raise savings "to lessen pressure on interest
rates."
   The IMF's 152 member countries subscribe quotas to the IMF
by pledging reserves in an exchange of assets. The IMF has
sometimes supplemented these resources by borrowing from
member countries. But it currently has sufficient resources,
according to Mr. Wilson, who added that he didn't think the
fund would need to borrow before the quota increase goes into
effect at the end of 1991.
   There are 11 countries that are seriously in arrears to
the IMF, and their overdue obligations total more than $3
billion. Under a U.S.-backed plan, these countries would be
given access to other IMF funds that could be used to pay
their obligations, provided these countries undertake tough
changes. If the nations fail to make these changes, the
countries risk losing gold they have already pledged to the
IMF that would be sold to make good the loans made to them.
   As part of the IMF quota increase, the rankings of several
large shareholders will change. The U.S. will remain the
largest holder with slightly more than 19%. Japan and West
Germany will rank second, with equal holdings of slightly
more than 6% each, while Britain and France will rank fourth
equally, with about 5.5% each.
   Britain has elected to lend France about 0.5 of a
percentage point of its share to allow the two countries to
rank equally. In return, the two countries will rank equally
for the foreseeable future, and France may lend Britain some
of its share after the next quota increase.
   The quota increase is linked to a change in the IMF's
articles that will allow the organization to suspend
uncooperative member countries. That's another intended
safeguard against payments arrears. "We aimed to create a
tool that is a middle solution," a senior Treasury official
said, who added that the IMF's current approach "isn't
providing a realistic solution to the problem."
   The cost of borrowing from the IMF also will rise soon as
part of its effort to clear arrears. IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus said that the institution will increase
charges on its regular loans by 0.35 of a percentage point
July 1. This, along with a cut of a little more than one
percentage point a year in what it pays to countries whose
currencies it uses, will allow the IMF to build a pool of
$1.3 billion over five years. The IMF now charges about 8.6%
annually on its regular loans.
   Many delegates attending the half-yearly meetings of the
IMF and World Bank already speculate that the IMF's next
quota review may include discussion of Soviet membership in
the group.
   Certainly, there is a recognition that the Soviets may
need more economic assistance. West German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel said, "Europe and the U.S. should work together
to stimulate growth and economic reform in the Soviet Union."
But he didn't advocate establishing new institutions for this
purpose beyond the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The EBRD, which is now being planned, will make
long-term loans to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
