   BRISBANE, Calif. -- Hitachi Ltd. said a federal judge in
Texas has dismissed one of a spate of patent-infringement
lawsuits pitting Motorola Inc. against the Japanese
electronics company.
   Hitachi said that on April 26, the U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Texas granted Hitachi's motion for
dismissal of a case claiming that Hitachi's H16
microcontroller infringed on a Motorola patent. At the time,
the court also ruled that the Motorola claim was barred by a
March decision declaring the Motorola patent in question to
be invalid.

   The case is one of several patent disputes involving
Motorola and Hitachi. Another case, involving Hitachi's
patent-infringement claim against Motorola's 88000 RISC
microprocessor, is scheduled for trial in September, Hitachi
said.
   In Schaumburg, Ill., a Motorola spokesman had no specific
comment on the court decision, but noted that litigation
surrounding the Hitachi H16 continues in challenges to other
patents.
   A Hitachi spokesman said in a news release that the two
companies are engaged in negotiations to try to settle their
outstanding disputes.
