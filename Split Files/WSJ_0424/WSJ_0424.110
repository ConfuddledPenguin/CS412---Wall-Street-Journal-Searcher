   Sharply higher crude oil prices boosted exploration and
production results at both Exxon Corp. and Amoco Corp., but
those same higher prices cut into chemical and refining
margins.
   Exxon operating profit in the first quarter rose slightly
although one-time items caused its net income to decline 29%.
Amoco profit rose 1.7%.

   Amoco said it paid an average of $20.79 a barrel for oil
in the quarter, more than $3 higher than a year ago. Because
crude oil is a raw material for so-called downstream
operations, chemical earnings were off sharply for both
companies, and gasoline refining and marketing profits were
weaker. Exxon and Amoco are the first major oil companies to
report first-quarter results, and other companies' earnings
are expected to follow the same pattern.
   Analysts say Exxon turned in a better first-quarter
performance than anticipated with its foreign exploration and
production business making a particularly strong showing.
Results "were better than what we were looking for," said
Frederick Leuffer, analyst for C.J. Lawrence Inc. Still,
Exxon lost 62.5 cents in composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange to close at $45.75 a share.
   Exxon reported net income of $1.28 billion, or $1.01 a
share, compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.41 a share, during
the same period last year. But the year-earlier quarterly
profit included a $535 million gain related to an accounting
change. Revenue grew by 20% to $26.7 billion.
   Profitability was marred somewhat by the U.S. refining and
marketing business, which reported a loss of $28 million down
from earnings of $37 million. Exxon explained some of this by
saying that results in the U.S. were unfavorably affected by
the partial loss of operating capacity at the Baton Rouge
refinery following a major explosion and fire last December.
   Missing in the quarter's results were any additional
charges related to cleaning up the spill caused when one of
Exxon's tankers rammed an underwater reef and dumped almost
11 million gallons into Prince William Sound last year. Last
year Exxon took $1.38 billion in charges stemming from
cleanup of its giant Alaskan oil spill.
   Exxon made no reference in its current earnings report to
the oil spill, which has made it the pariah of the industry.
But analysts say they don't expect the company to take any
additional charges related to cleanup efforts, which are to
resume in Alaska on May 1. "I think Exxon has probably
overreserved" for the upcoming cleanup effort, said Bryan
Jacoboski, analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc.
   In the first quarter, Exxon, New York, purchased 2.2
million shares of its own stock at a cost of $104 million.
Analysts noted that the buy-back rate has slowed to its
lowest level in more than seven years. They speculated that
some of the money typically used for stock repurchases was
shifted into capital spending, which grew by 5% excluding the
$3.9 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada. The growth in
spending, albeit small, indicates "a more aggressive,
healthier approach" for the company, Mr. Jacoboski said.
   Amoco said net rose to $466 million, or 91 cents a share,
from $458 million, or 89 cents a share. The 1989 first
quarter included a special charge of $57 million for
consolidation activities. Revenue rose 9% to $7.13 billion
from $6.52 billion.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Amoco fell 75
cents to $50.25 a share.
   Like Exxon, Amoco's exploration and production earnings
surged, to $295 million from $203 million. Despite higher
natural gas prices in the quarter, Amoco reduced its natural
gas production, as did many producers when the price fell
sharply after the unusually bitter cold ended by February.
   Chicago-based Amoco said its chemical earnings fell 49% to
$80 million. The company said margins were lower, as they
have been for a number of quarters. A combination of higher
prices for crude -- the feedstock for petrochemicals -- with
lower chemical prices is behind the profit decline.
   With gasoline refining and marketing profit of $111
million in the quarter, results were down just slightly from
$114 million.
   Separately, Ashland Oil Inc., Ashland, Ky., by and large a
gasoline refiner and marketer without its own crude oil
production, had a weak quarter. It had net of $913,000, or
two cents a share, compared with a loss of $13.8 million, or
25 cents a share, which included a $9 million charge. Sales
rose to $1.97 billion from $1.78 billion.
   Amerada Hess Corp., New York, said net fell to $39.7
million, or 49 cents a share, from $220.2 milllion, or $2.70
a share. Amerada Hess earnings fell so sharply in part
because of its accounting method, which analysts say cuts
into reported earnings when crude prices fall during a
quarter, as they did in the first period.
