   WASHINGTON -- Earlier this month, Democratic Sen. Paul
Simon, regarded as one of the strongest congressional
supporters of the environment, voted against the Clean-Air
Bill. At the same time, GOP Rep. Lynn Martin, seldom counted
as an ardent backer of environmental legislation, said she
would support the bill in the House.
   The election shuffle is on -- and the two Illinois
lawmakers, opponents in one of this year's fiercest Senate
races, aren't the only ones moving around the floor.

   Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, for example,
showed virtually no interest in health-care issues for the
first five years of his term. But once Democratic challenger
Harvey Sloane, a physician, signaled that he would make
health the centerpiece of his campaign, Sen. McConnell rushed
out a comprehensive health-care proposal of his own that
would cost $21 billion over five years.
   Voters in 35 states will cast ballots in Senate elections
this fall, and though it's unlikely a substantial shift will
occur in the 55-45 advantage the Democrats held until
Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii died this month,
lawmakers have begun to position themselves for the November
elections.
   Not all the positioning is as visible as Mr. Simon's vote
against the Clean-Air Bill or Mr. McConnell's effort to
outflank his opponent on health care. Lawmakers know they can
sculpt their political profiles more deftly with a chisel
than with a jackhammer, and often the adjustments they make
are subtle and unobtrusive.
   "A vote here and a vote there can really help," says
Richard Fenno, a University of Rochester specialist on
Congress. "A senator knows what his constituency looks like,
and the closer he gets to Election Day, the more he can
anticipate what he'll face back home. A few votes one way or
the other can help a senator move off the extremes and help
him at home."
   Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa, for example, was rated the
most liberal member of the Senate in 1988 by the National
Journal, which over the past decade developed a rating system
for floor votes. But in 1989, the last year for which such
ratings would be available to voters contemplating their
decisions in November, Mr. Harkin didn't even rank among the
20 most liberal lawmakers in the Senate. At the same time,
Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, the most
conservative member of the Senate in 1988 in the National
Journal ratings, ranked roughly in the middle of Senate
Republicans in 1989 as he prepared for this year's election
battle.
   The phenomenon is repeated again and again. Democratic
Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, for example, more than doubled
his score in ratings compiled between 1988 and 1989 by the
National Taxpayers Union, which seeks to identify lawmakers
who it says protect the taxpayers' dollars. He also ran up a
substantial improvement between 1982 and 1983 as he prepared
for his re-election battle in 1984.
   "Democratic senators who rack up scores as big spenders
tend to significantly change in the year prior to their
re-election," says Marshall Taylor, communications director
for the taxpayers' group. "They become more fiscally
conservative. It's a remarkable pattern."
   Sometimes lawmakers who make striking departures from
their record manage not to alienate their old allies. Sen.
Simon, despite being only one of five Democrats to oppose the
clean-air legislation (Sen. Alan Dixon, his Illinois
colleague, was another), hasn't relinquished the support of
environmentalists. The bill, says Ali Webb, communications
director for the League of Conservation Voters, was
"something that would cost him too much at home."
   Mr. Simon voted with the environmentalists on all the
amendments to strengthen the legislation, such as reducing
emissions from new cars and requiring an alternative-fuels
program for the dirtiest cities. He balked only at final
passage, citing the potential loss of 18,000 coal-related
jobs in Illinois and the prospect that utility rates in the
state might rise as much as 25%.
   "The bill is not fair to utility payers and coal miners in
Illinois," Mr. Simon says now. "I'm for a clean-air bill, but
I have to be fair to my region."
   Rep. Martin was swift to assail Sen. Simon for his vote.
"I think it's time for this kind of legislation," she says.
But the Sierra Club branded her a "Jill-come-lately." Reid
Wilson, the group's political director, says, "He's been a
consistent ally, and she has been a frequent opponent."
   Sen. McConnell, meanwhile, has raised eyebrows with his
costly health plan. "McConnell has not been particularly
outspoken on health issues," says Grady Stumbo, a Democrat
who is a former Kentucky state secretary of human resources.
"There's no question that this is an effort to go through the
gate first on an issue that one of his opponents is going to
raise." Moreover, Carl Schramm, president of the Health
Insurance Association of America and a prominent figure in
health-care planning circles, says "there isn't much appetite
in Washington today for comprehensive health-care plans." He
sees no prospect for the McConnell proposal, saying, "The
last thing Congress wants to do is move on this."
   Former GOP Rep. Hal Daub, who is challenging Democratic
Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, gambled when he vowed not to
accept any money from political-action committess, or PACs.
"The influence was mounting in a corrupting way," he says.
"This has to stop, and politicians have to have the courage
to stand up and say we can do it differently."
   But Mr. Daub received $923,172 from PACs between 1979 and
1988, according to Common Cause. In 1984 he answered an
opponent's argument that PACs were a corrosive influence in
politics by saying he doubted "that there is a more phony
issue." And a year ago, he contributed to the PAC run by
Deloitte &amp; Touche, a big accounting firm where he works as
director of governmental affairs.
   Today his 1984 opponent, Tom Cavanaugh, now the Douglas
County clerk, calls Mr. Daub "a great chameleon," and Robert
Spire, the state's Republican attorney general, says Mr.
Daub's decision was "politically motivated" but probably
shrewd.
   In all, the Democrats have to defend 16 seats, the
Republicans 15, and four seats are open because of
retirements and death.
   "There are a lot of tough races out there, but we think
we're in a good position to hold the 55 seats to go into
1992," says Anita Dunn, communications director for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The Democrats want
to consolidate their hold to prepare for the 1992 elections,
when they will defend a minimum of 20 Senate seats, including
11 freshmen, most of whom won by less than 55% of the vote in
the non-presidential election year of 1986.
   The tightest race may be in Iowa, where Sen. Harkin is
trying to fend off a challenge from GOP Rep. Tom Tauke.
Another incumbent facing a tough challenge is Democrat
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who is running against GOP
Rep. Claudine Schneider.
   Louisiana Republicans, meanwhile, are seeking to focus
attention on state Sen. Ben Bagert, who is challenging
incumbent Democrat Bennett Johnston. They also are trying to
divert attention from state Rep. David Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader who wants the seat. Republican leaders are hoping
Mr. Duke's high profile won't translate into votes and are
dismissing him, as Republican Senatorial Campaign Commitee
communications director Wendy DeMocker puts it, as little
more than "a curiosity who puts on an interesting show."
