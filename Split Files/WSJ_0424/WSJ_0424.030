   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by General Motors Corp., which was seeking to kill a
warranty-related lawsuit that may become a class action for
nearly 600,000 purchasers of 1981-1985 cars and trucks with
5.7-liter diesel engines.
   The suit was filed by 183 purchasers of diesel-powered
vehicles for alleged violations of a federal law that
regulates warranties on consumer products. The purchasers,
who experienced problems with the engines, sued over the
company's failure to repair defects and challenged GM's
limits imposed on "implied" warranties.

   The lawsuit hasn't been certified as a class action, yet.
The purchasers say that if a federal court recognizes the
case as a class action, there may be 596,364 persons making
claims against GM.
   "We're dissapointed that the Supreme Court declined to
review the court of appeals decision," a GM spokesman said.
"The Supreme Court decision is not a decision on the merits
of the case or that it can proceed with a class action. GM
intends to vigorously defend itself in this case."
   The dispute is over the so-called implied warranty of
merchantability. Motor vehicle makers provide buyers some
express, written warranties on parts. But most states also
have laws regulating sales that add an additional, implied
promise in consumer transactions that the merchandise is fit
for consumer use.
   Manufacturers may place limits on how long express
warranties last, such as 24 months or 24,000 miles. But the
GM purchasers sued over the company's effort to impose the
same limit on the duration of implied warranties.
   Before trial, a federal court dismissed the claims of 107
purchasers who said the problems with their vehicles began
after express warranties had expired.
   But a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., reinstated
the claims, ruling that the purchasers should be allowed to
offer evidence that applying the time limits of express
warranties to implied warranties is unfair to consumers.
   The high court, without comment, refused to hear GM's
appeal. (General Motors Corp. vs. Carlson)
                                                                                                       

   Court In Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other actions, the high court:
   -- Agreed to decide whether convicted criminals who didn't
object to having federal magistrates preside over jury
selection at their trials are now entitled to new trials
because of a Supreme Court ruling last year that magistrates
don't have the power to oversee jury selection. (U.S. vs.
France)
   -- Refused to hear a challenge by PPG Industries Inc. to
federal clean-water standards imposed by the Environmental
Protection Agency. (PPG Industries Inc. vs. EPA)
