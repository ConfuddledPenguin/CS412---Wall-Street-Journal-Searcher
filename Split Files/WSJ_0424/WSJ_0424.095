   BOSTON -- An extract of oat bran is being developed as a
combination low-calorie fat substitute and
cholesterol-lowering food.
   The new oat bran product, dubbed oatrim, has been used
experimentally to make an ice cream-like dessert and can be
used in a variety of room-temperature and low-temperature
foods, including yogurt, bread, cookie icing, salad dressing,
sour cream and mayonnaise, an Agriculture Department
scientist told a meeting of the American Chemical Society
here.

   The Agriculture Department is discussing pilot-plant
production of the product with two unnamed food processors,
George E. Inglett, a chemist with the Agricultural Research
Service laboratory in Peoria, Ill., said at a news
conference. Oatrim is being patented by the Agriculture
Department.
   At the same meeting, other researchers, including the
manager of new product research for Miller Brewing Co.,
Milwaukee, put in a strong plug for barley bran and barley
byproducts of brewing as being comparable to oat bran in
lowering blood cholesterol levels.
   A recently published study indicating that oat bran does
little to lower cholesterol levels came under fire from
several researchers at the conference, including Rosemary
Newman, professor of foods and nutrition at Montana State
University. They said the study, by researchers at Boston's
Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, involved only volunteers with low
or normal cholesterol levels, where the effect of oat bran
isn't so pronounced as in people with high cholesterol
levels. The Boston researchers acknowledged that people with
high cholesterol may benefit more from high-fiber diets than
did the participants in their study.
   The market for fat substitutes could be huge. Oatrim can't
be used in foods that are cooked, so it would compete most
directly with Simplesse, a fat substitute from Monsanto Co.'s
NutraSweet subsidiary that also breaks down at high
temperatures. Simplesse already is used in an ice cream-like
dessert, Simple Pleasures, that NutraSweet is introducing
now. Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., is
awaiting regulatory approval for a similar fat substitute
that also can't be used in cooked foods. Olestra, a Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. fat substitute awaiting regulatory approval, does
hold up at high temperatures.
   Oatrim is made by treating oat bran with enzymes to
produce a white, tasteless flour or a powder that is rich in
compounds known as beta-glucans, the portion of oat bran
believed responsible for lowering blood cholesterol levels,
Mr. Inglett said. When heated and then allowed to cool, the
powder changes to a gel that can give foods a creamy texture
similar to that produced by saturated fats, the chemist said.
   Mr. Inglett said four ounces of an ice cream-like dessert
made with oatrim contained almost no fat, only four
milligrams of cholesterol and only 135 calories. In four
ounces of premium ice cream, there are 18 to 22 grams of fat,
85 milligrams of cholesterol and 250 to 300 calories. A taste
panel judged the oatrim dessert only slightly less sweet than
the ice cream and somewhat less creamy tasting, he reported.
   Although the product's effects on cholesterol levels
haven't yet been tested on humans, tests on newly hatched
chicks at Montana State University showed that oatrim lowered
cholesterol levels by almost 18%, with sharp reductions in
the LDL form of cholesterol, the "bad" type of cholesterol,
and moderate increases in the HDL form of cholesterol, the
form thought to provide some protection against heart
disease, according to the university's Ms. Newman.
   Mr. Inglett said 30 grams of oatrim added to an instant
breakfast drink contain about 2.5 grams of beta-glucans,
comparable to eating 100 grams of regular oat bran.
   Ms. Newman said she was "excited" about the oatrim
product, but she also reported animal and human tests showing
that barley is rich in beta-glucans and has
cholesterol-lowering properties comparable to oats. An
experiment with 22 volunteers showed both barley and oats,
added to foods as flours, reduced blood cholesterol levels by
14%.
   Miller Brewing's new product research manager, Frank E.
Weber, said the Philip Morris unit now is pushing the use of
"brewer's grain" as a cholesterol-lowering food additive.
Brewer's grain is a byproduct of the barley used in brewing,
and he said Miller produces about 200 million pounds of it a
year. Much of it has been sold traditionally for about 40
cents a pound for adding to animal feeds.
   New research, Mr. Weber said, shows that brewer's grain is
rich in tocotrienol, a chemical cousin to vitamin E.
Experiments show that 30 milligrams a day of tocotrienol,
about the amount contained in three tablespoons of brewer's
grain, can lower blood cholesterol levels by 15% in three
weeks. Miller, he said, has recently begun selling brewer's
grain to food processors for use in products such as
high-fiber breads.
