   Cie. Internationale des Wagons-Lits &amp; du Tourisme reported
a 46% plunge in group profit in 1989 in the absence of
extraordinary earnings and amid problems for its Europcar
car-hire venture.
   Group profit fell to 1.46 billion Belgian francs ($41.9
million) from 2.68 billion francs in 1988, the Belgium-based
travel and tourism group said. Group revenue gained 21% to
96.44 billion francs from 80.02 billion francs in 1988.

   Operating profit edged up 6.8% to 3.096 billion francs.
   Wagons-Lits said that the group's results in 1989 followed
an exceptional year in 1988, when the group had earned a
windfall profit on the sale of part of an office building in
Paris.
   But Wagons-Lits' 1989 results also were influenced by the
poor performance of the company's Europcar unit, which was
hit by the rise in interest rates and a slump in the
second-hand automobile market in Britain.
