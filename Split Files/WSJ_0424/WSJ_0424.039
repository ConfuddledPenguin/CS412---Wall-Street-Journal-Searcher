   LOS ANGELES -- Newspaper publishers will get more bad news
today about advertising spending in 1990.
   Craig Standen, president of the Newspaper Advertising
Bureau (NAB), is expected to report today at the American
Newspaper Publishers Association's annual meeting that the
rate of growth in advertising spending in the nation's
newspapers will remain flat in 1990.

   Mr. Standen, in the NAB's "state of the business" address,
blames the industry stall on lowered retail and classified ad
spending. Retail advertising, which is more than half of most
newspapers' revenues, has dropped as retail sales have
fallen. A slowed economy in most parts of the country has
also resulted in large drops in the level of classified
employment, real estate and automotive advertising.
Classified ads make up about 40% of newspaper ad revenues.
   Publishers were hoping for some good news after several
years of a declining growth rate and recent severe falloffs
in classified and retail ad spending. Mr. Standen is expected
to report, however, that should the economy strengthen, the
growth rate will increase to between 5% and 6% in 1991.
   Newspapers continue to be the largest advertising medium
in the U.S. -- larger than TV and magazines combined -- but
their growth has declined steadily from 9% in 1987, to 6% in
1988.
