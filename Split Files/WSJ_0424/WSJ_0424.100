   NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled for the fourth straight session
as investors turned more bearish over rising interest rates
and weak earnings.
   Pansophic Systems became the latest in a series of recent
casualties of earnings-related selling, as its shares lost
around one-third of their value in extremely brisk trading
after a surprisingly weak earnings forecast.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 29.28 points to
2666.67, the lowest closing level since March 5. In the past
four sessions, the average has posted consecutive losses for
a total decline of 99.11 points, or 3.6%. Yesterday's
sell-off was broad: 1,229 issues declined on the New York
Stock Exchange while only 328 advanced, the third time more
than 1,000 stocks have finished lower in the past four days.
Big Board volume of 136,150,000 shares was down sharply from
Friday's expiration-bloated volume of 174,260,000.
   Stocks fell quickly in morning trading on sell programs
that helped smack many key issues through what traders
considered important support levels. McDonnell Douglas fell 3
7/8 to 51 1/4, below a key support level of 54, said Jack
Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns Cos. Monsanto
broke support at 105, falling 2 7/8 to 102 7/8; Du Pont fell
through 36, slipping 7/8 to 35 3/4.
   CNA Financial broke 72, sliding 1 7/8 to 71 5/8.
   Mr. Solomon said the breakdown in individual stocks
reflects the weakness in key averages. "The weakness of the
Dow Jones Utility Average is of major importance," he said.
"It closed {yesterday} below the October {intraday} low of
207, and is at the lowest {closing} level since June 1989.
And this average is supposed to be a leading indicator." The
Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2.52 to 205.67; the
transportation average tumbled 13.51 to 1141.36.
   Citing the increase in market interest rates, First Boston
lowered its recommended asset allocation on stocks to 45%
from 55%, while increasing its bond weighting to 30% from
20%. The other 25% of the model portfolio remains in cash.
   The stock market "is very vulnerable to any rise in
interest rates from these levels," said Carmine Grigoli, the
firm's chief equity portfolio strategist. "Bonds are looking
more and more attractive relative to stocks."
   Yesterday, Treasury bonds fell nearly 1/4 point, or $2.50
for each $1,000 face amount, raising the yield to 8.96%.
   Other Wall Street strategists are changing their outlook
for stocks. Yesterday, Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst
for Kidder Peabody, urged the firm's clients to adopt a very
cautious posture on stocks. Mr. Jarrett said he expects
Treasury bond yields to rise above 9% and the Dow industrials
to fall to 2200 "by late summer." Mr. Jarrett advises staying
with stocks that have held up despite the market's sell-off,
such as Schlumberger, Motorola, International Business
Machines and Deere.
   Elaine Garzarelli, director of quantitative analysis at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, told clients Friday that at current
interest rates stocks are overvalued. She expects a
correction in the Dow to 2500 or 2600. However, Ms.
Garzarelli expects the correction to be followed by "a strong
rally." Among other things, she said the rate of
deterioration in corporate profits is slowing.
   Analysts estimate that aggregate earnings on the 500
companies in Standard &amp; Poor's index will be down 9% in the
first quarter vs. the same quarter a year ago, according to
Zacks Investment Research; however, the same analysts expect
earnings to rebound in the second half, from very depressed
year-earlier levels, and end the year 13% higher than in
1989.
   Pansophic plummeted 5 1/8 to 10 1/2 on NYSE -- composite
volume of 1.8 million shares -- nearly 54 times the average
daily volume in the software company's stock and more than
9.5% of its shares outstanding. The issue posted a loss of
32.8%.
   The company said it expects to report break-even results
for its fiscal year ending April 30, reflecting plans to take
charges for closing its Brazilian subsidiary and writing off
some assets of its graphics division. Analysts polled by
Zacks Investment Research had expected the company to post
net income of $1.15 to $1.30 a share for the fiscal year.
   Philadelphia Electric, which reported a first-quarter loss
of 40 cents a share, went down 3/4 to 15 3/4 on volume of 1.1
million shares. The utility also lowered its quarterly
dividend by 45%, to 30 cents a share, and said it would
institute a program to reduce costs by at least $100 million
annually by the end of 1991.
   Merrill Lynch, which fell 3/4 to 22 1/2, topped the NYSE's
list of most active issues as 2.9 million shares changed
hands. Other active issues were mostly lower as well; the
exceptions included Philip Morris, which rose 5/8 to 41 5/8
on 2.1 million shares, and Chase Manhattan, which closed
unchanged at 27 on 1.2 million shares.
   Exxon, whose first-quarter earnings were in line with
expectations, nevertheless dipped 5/8 to 45 3/4. Stocks hit
with selling in the wake of first-quarter reports included
Centel, which went down 3/4 to 30 1/4, and Far West
Financial, down 1/2 to 2.
   Handleman tumbled 3 5/8 to 14 3/8 after saying it expects
to post net income of eight cents to 15 cents a share for the
fiscal quarter ending Saturday, below both analysts'
forecasts and the year-earlier level.
   But Storage Technology gained 1 3/8 to 22 7/8 after
reporting better-than-expected earnings for the first
quarter. Although the company's net income dropped about 34%
from a year earlier, its income from operations surged nearly
51%.
   Armstrong World Industries, whose net from continuing
operations for the first quarter went up 68% from the
year-earlier level, rose 1 to 33 5/8. Communications
Satellite, whose net increased 15%, added 3/8 to 31 1/4.
   Bank of Boston gained 3/8 to 11 3/4. Responding to
analysts' speculation that its quarterly dividend could be in
jeopardy, the company told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report it would pay its dividend of 31 cents a share later
this month as scheduled. It added that it still expects to
report a first-quarter profit.
   Digital Equipment rose 1/4 to 83 1/4. Its board authorized
the repurchase of up to five million common shares, or about
4.1% of its shares outstanding.
   MGM/UA Communications rose 3/8 to 17 3/8 following news
that the required waiting period for Pathe Communications'
takeover offer of $20 a share had expired.
   King World Productions dropped 1 3/4 to 35 1/2. Confirming
market rumors, the company told the investor report it had
postponed the launch of a new game show based on the game
"Monopoly" from September until at least January 1991.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.01
to 344.95. The American Stock Exchange volume totaled
13,360,000 shares compared with 13,700,000 Friday.
   B.A.T Industries dropped 7/16 to 11 9/ 16. Hoylake
Investments, a group headed by British financier Sir James
Goldsmith, said it wouldn't renew its bid to acquire the
company.
   Sikes' Class A shares surged 3 7/8 to 16 1/8.
   Premark International agreed to acquire the company for
$201 million in cash; the accord calls for Class A
shareholders to receive $16.40 for each of their shares.
   Alza skidded 3 3/8 to 36 5/8. The company posted
first-quarter net income of 16 cents a share, up from 13
cents a year earlier but on the low end of analysts'
estimates.
