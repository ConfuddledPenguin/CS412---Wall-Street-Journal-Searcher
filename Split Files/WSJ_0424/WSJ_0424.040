   MEXICO CITY -- From Tokyo to London, this has been a year
to forget in most world stock markets. Thirteen of the top 16
markets declined in the first quarter.
   But Mexico's stock market, known as the Bolsa de Valores,
has been a shining star amid the market gloom. So far this
year, the Bolsa's stock index is up nearly 25%.

   Among the factors bolstering the $35 billion Mexican stock
market: Many investors believe that the best is yet to come
in the market-oriented economic program of Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   "Inflation is under control, and the president has set all
of the bases for sustained growth," says Gerardo Copca
Sanchez, an analyst at Casa de Bolsa Mexico, an investment
house. "Investors are eager to see what he does next and are
betting on even more significant reforms."
   In particular, two of the pillars of Mr. Salinas's plan to
revitalize the Mexican economy -- privatizing state-owned
companies and opening the country to more foreign investment
-- have helped set off the market's boom.
   Bank stocks have been buoyed by a surge of rumors --
strenuously disputed by the government -- that the
state-controlled banking system will soon be privatized. The
banks were nationalized in 1982 in a last-gasp move by
President Jose Lopez Portillo, whose mismanagement of the
economy was instrumental in turning Mexico's oil boom into a
debt bust. The relationship between the government and
private sector in Mexico has never been the same since the
nationalization, even though 34% of bank shares were
subsequently placed back in private hands.
   Mr. Salinas, who has overseen the sale or closing of some
700 state-owned companies over the past five years, recently
took a significant step toward giving private business people
more autonomy in investing in the bank sector. The government
eased rigid restrictions on the amount of bank stock an
individual investor can hold.
   Although officials have denied that the change is a
precursor to privatization, they haven't succeeded in damping
speculation that the government intends to get out of the
banking business. Rolando Vega, president of the Business
Coordinating Council, Mexico's most powerful business lobby,
told reporters last month that the reprivatization of the
bank was "very near."
   Whether that is so or not, there were sound technical
reasons for investors to take a look at bank stocks this
year. "Even without the rumors of privatization, its been a
good time to buy bank stocks because they started the year
greatly undervalued," says Moises Tiktin, an analyst at
Valores Finamex, a Mexican investment house. At the end of
last year, Mexican bank stocks were trading at 3.32 times
corporate earnings, compared with a P/E multiple of 8.02
times for non-financial stocks, according to Mr. Tiktin.
   The mix of privatization speculators and bargain hunters
has triggered lightning growth in bank stocks. Leading the
way were Banca Serfin S.A., which rose 78.6% in the first
quarter, Banco Internacional S.A., which was up 67.6%, and
Bancomer S.A., which rose 56.6%.
   Yet another factor in the Bolsa's boom has been the
arrival in force of foreign investors, who had long been all
but shut out of Mexico's market. In November, the government
opened a trust administered by the state development bank
that allows foreigners to buy into Mexico's publicly traded
companies. Since then, foreign investors have bought about
$350 million of the "certificates of participation," which
grant holders all the privileges of shareholders except
voting rights.
   Grupo Industrial Alfa S.A., a huge conglomerate that has
sharply reduced its debt and increased its exports, has
attracted the greatest interest from foreigners. Another
favorite has been the government's 56%-owned telephone
monopoly, Telefonos de Mexico, which the government has said
it intends to privatize later this year or early next.
   "If handled properly, the sale of Telmex is going to
really help put Mexico on the map for investors all over the
world," says Douglas Campbell, president of D.A. Campbell, a
Los Angeles investment firm that tracks international
telephone companies.
