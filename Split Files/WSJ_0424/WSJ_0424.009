   A federal appeals court in New York has allowed an ailing
railroad to sue Conrail for allegedly setting monopolistic
freight rates.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a
lower court decision dismissing the case. Delaware &amp; Hudson
Railway Co., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings,
sued Conrail in 1986 over alleged antitrust violations in
Conrail's rate-setting policy.

   Delaware &amp; Hudson had to rely on part of the Conrail
system when it shipped newsprint from Canada to the middle
Atlantic states. In its suit, the company alleges that a
change in Conrail's rates in the early 1980s forced it out of
that market.
   The appeals court in Manhattan ruled that the lower-court
judge failed to adequately consider Conrail's monopolistic
power. The court said Delaware &amp; Hudson either had to give up
its business in the market or pay a sharp increase to Conrail
that would wipe out its profits on the middle Atlantic route.
   Delaware &amp; Hudson, one of Conrail's few rail-freight
competitors in the Northeast, filed for Chapter 11 protection
in 1988. James K. Manning, an attorney for Delaware &amp; Hudson,
said the change in Conrail's rate-setting policy contributed
to the railroad's financial troubles. "In our view, this has
been part of the problem," said Mr. Manning. "We were denied
any economic access in this market." For Delaware &amp; Hudson,
the newsprint market was "quite important because it happens
to be a market that was well-suited to rail traffic," Mr.
Manning said.
   Attorneys for Conrail, a private rail freight company set
up by Congress in 1976, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Conrail, based in Philadelphia, had claimed in the
district court that its practices weren't anti-competitive
because it was merely trying to maximize its profits. The
appeals court, however, said that considering Conrail's
control over the market, there are grounds for a trial to
determine whether the rate policy was monopolistic. Delaware
&amp; Hudson is seeking damages of more than $5 million, which
would be trebled under antitrust law.

   HEART SURGEON wins $29 million libel verdict in Texas.
   A state court jury in San Antonio awarded the damages to
Sudhir Srivastava, a heart surgeon who alleged that his
practice was destroyed by stories broadcast by a local
television station owned by Harte-Hankes Communications Inc.
The award is believed to be the largest libel verdict ever
issued in Texas.
   The station, KENS-TV in San Antonio, carried a series of
reports in 1985 stating that a group of physicians, including
Dr. Srivastava, had performed unnecessary surgery on elderly
patients for profit. Dr. Srivastava sued for libel,
contending the stories were false, and that they had ruined
his reputation.
   James Branton, a San Antonio attorney with Branton &amp; Hall,
which represented the plaintiff, said his client didn't get
another patient for more than three years, was hit with a
"flood" of malpractice suits and eventually had to relocate
to Midland, Texas, where he now practices.
   The jury's award, issued April 10, included $11.5 million
in actual damages and $17.5 million in punitive damages. The
verdict still must be reviewed by State District Court Judge
Carolyn Spears, who could uphold it, reduce it or set it
aside.
   Mark Cannan, a San Antonio attorney with Lang, Ladon,
Green, Coghlan &amp; Fisher, counsel for Harte-Hanks, said he
will appeal if the verdict is approved.
   "I feel there are various and substantial grounds for
appeal," he said, declining to elaborate.

   SOVIET SANCTIONS in Lithuania jeopardize opportunities for
U.S. lawyers.
   American law firms promoting joint ventures in the Soviet
Union are concluding that now is not the time to move into
the Baltic republics. James Dobkin, who leads Arnold &amp;
Porter's international joint venture practice, says that his
clients who had considered such projects have decided that
they are unthinkable now, "at least for the immediate
future."
   Ed Lieberman, a partner at the Washington-based firm of
Cole Corette &amp; Abrutyn, agrees that American law firms and
their clients are staying away from the Baltics "as a result
of concerns about Lithuania."
   Tensions in Lithuania are having less effect on American
legal entrepreneurship elsewhere in the Soviet Union. But Mr.
Lieberman worries that rising tensions in Lithuania could
scuttle trade and tax treaties being readied for discussion
at the May summit, which in turn could slow the efforts of
American law firms trying to develop a Soviet market for
their clients.
   Assistant U.S. trade representative Peter Allegeier told
lawyers and businessmen last week that the U.S. is assuming
that events in Lithuania won't disrupt trade.

   ATTORNEY GENERAL pessimistic about recouping losses from
S&amp;L fraud.
   "I don't think a lot of this money is available," said
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, after a speech
yesterday in Dallas. Recovery is complicated, he said,
because "some of those assets have been dissipated," and some
of the top suspects have sought bankruptcy-court protection.
   But the U.S. Justice Department is making an effort to
obtain restitution in certain instances. In Dallas last week,
Justice Department prosecutor Robert Hauberg urged a federal
judge to order Woody F. Lemons, former chief executive
officer of defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Dallas, to turn over $9.7 million to the government. U.S.
District Judge Robert B. Maloney hasn't ruled on the
restitution request but he isn't expected to treat the
prosecutor's motion lightly.
   Earlier this month, the judge sentenced Mr. Lemons to 30
years in federal prison, one of the stiffest terms to date in
a thrift-related fraud case.

   PATENT RAID: Baker &amp; Botts, a Houston law firm, raided the
Dallas law firm of Baker, Mills &amp; Glast for lawyers
specializing in patent law. Baker &amp; Botts recruited name
partner Jerry W. Mills and as many as 11 associates,
according to E. William Barnett, managing partner of Baker &amp;
Botts. Mr. Mills, 49 years old, will head Baker &amp; Botts's
patent section. Robert A. Baker, managing director of
90-lawyer Baker, Mills, said his law firm has not yet decided
on a new name.
