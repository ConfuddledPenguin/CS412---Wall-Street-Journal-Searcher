   NEW YORK -- Jefferies Group Inc., after hiring a flock of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s junk-bond traders in
California, is urging the rest of its "junk" staff here to
move to the city that made Drexel famous: Beverly Hills.
   The Los Angeles brokerage firm is quietly urging its
junk-bond professionals to leave New York for the California
city, where a junk-bond universe was built by Drexel's former
junk-bond chief Michael Milken.

   The move will help ensure that the former Drexel traders
will feel at home and more easily retain their clients,
traders said. That's especially important at a time when the
junk market has contracted sharply and Drexel's junk
professionals are filtering throughout Wall Street and
elsewhere.
   Jefferies officials, for their part, sought to play down
the shift. "We have an open speaker system" throughout
Jefferies offices nationwide, says Frank Baxter, chief
executive officer. "Where someone is located isn't really
that important." Jefferies's equity operations in New York
won't be affected by the shift.
   Although some of Jefferies's junk-bond professionals "are
mutually considering whether they'd like to move West," Mr.
Baxter adds, he says there are no "present plans" to purge
their entire New York-based junk operations.
   The shift began several weeks ago, when Jefferies hired
seven former Drexel junk professionals -- nearly doubling the
size of its junk-bond staff, previously centered in New York,
in one fell swoop. As part of a negotiated deal, some traders
said, Jefferies promised the former Drexel executives that
they could stay in California.
   Since then, the firm's junk-bond professionals have been
reporting to David Sydorick, one of the former Drexel
salesmen who is based in Beverly Hills. And Ronald Davis,
former head of the firm's New York junk-bond group, already
has moved to the firm's Dallas office.
   Jefferies isn't the first brokerage firm to urge some of
its junk-bond staff to look West. Last year, Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. had sought new offices for its growing junk operations in
Beverly Hills but has since decided to keep its junk-bond
trading desk in New York. Jefferies says it plans to
eventually shift its staff to the Westwood section of Los
Angeles.
   Meantime, a former Drexel junk-bond trader who lives in
California and recently moved to Jefferies concedes, "There's
no good business reason to be in California and not be part
of the Wall Street community." But, he adds, the former
Drexel employees all live in California and will easily fit
in at Jefferies.
   Besides, he says, "All we need is a telephone."
