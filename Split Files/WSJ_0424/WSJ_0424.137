   A Shift to Services
   Means Shrinking Staff

   BUSINESS establishments in the U.S. are shrinking.
   A new study by the Small Business Administration shows
that the average number of employees per place of business
decreased 7% between 1977 and 1986, when the most recent
figures were provided.
   The SBA attributes the decrease to the shift from a
goods-producing economy to a service economy.
   While manufacturing experienced a 7.6% decline in
employees per business establishment during the period,
services posted a 12% increase and retailing had a 15% rise.
   "In manufacturing, we've seen a lot of downsizing, and new
plants are smaller in terms of number of employees. By
contrast, in retail there's been a lot of merger activity,
and that may be the reason for the average increase in size
there," explains Bruce D. Phillips, who is in charge of data
analysis for the SBA's Office of Advocacy.
   Geographically, the Mountain states, from Montana to
Arizona, had the biggest drop in number of employees per
establishment -- 19%. The Midwestern states had a 17%
decrease and Southern states showed a 10% to 12% decrease.
The West Coast, however, posted a sharp gain in employees per
firm, rising 40% over the decade-long period. The only other
region to show an increase was the Mid-Atlantic, up 1.6%.
   The study doesn't distinguish individual businesses from
units of larger companies.
                                                                                                       

   Fighting Foreign Rivals
   Without Losing Money
                                                                                                       

   MORE SMALL companies are finding they can file their own
complaints -- without a lawyer -- against foreign competitors
violating trade laws.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission's Trade Remedy
Assistance Office, established as a separate unit a year ago,
focuses mainly on helping small companies file petitions to
the commission to halt unfair trade practices, such as
"dumping" goods at illegally low prices or infringing on
intellectual property rights.
   The office says 10 small companies pursued complaints in
the past year, compared with "two or three" the previous year
when the office's functions were handled part time as part of
another bureau's work. Successful petitions commonly result
in orders imposing a high duty on the foreign product or
barring it entirely.
   "I pursued our case because I found I could do it without
a lawyer," says Nicholas Polydoris, chairman of ENM Co.,
Chicago, a maker of digital counters. With the Trade Remedy
Assistance Office's help, the company last month filed an
anti-dumping petition against a Brazilian competitor.
"Without this program, we would have gradually phased out the
product and emphasized other products," he says. "I found
lawyers dealing with the ITC might expect $250,000, and we
couldn't risk that kind of money." Instead, young staff
members Thomas Howland and Anup Manchanda prepared the
petition with guidance from Washington.
   The process is cheap -- but exhaustive. Geofrey Wyatt,
executive vice president of Wyatt Technology Corp., a Santa
Barbara, Calif., maker of analytical instruments, says
preparing a recently filed 150-page anti-dumping petition
against a Japanese concern took half his time for four
months. "But if we had hired a Washington law firm, the whole
process would cost $100,000 to $1 million," he says. "Just
getting to the stage we're at would have been $50,000 to
$100,000. I thought it would be a lot harder than it turned
out to be -- and we have spent nothing," he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Incubators Could Use
   Some Help Themselves
                                                                                                       

   AS FAST AS they've spread, business incubators need
improving, a recent survey suggests.
   These business parks are designed to nurture fledgling
companies with low rent and shared office services, as well
as management, financial and legal advice. Their numbers have
grown from 50 in 1984 to 400 today.
   But nearly 40% of incubator tenants surveyed by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand's National Emerging Business Services group say
incubator managers should be better trained, devote more time
to their tenants and increase their tenants' exposure to
accountants, lawyers and consultants. Only 30% of the 133
respondents said the incubator played a major role in helping
them obtain financing.
   Despite such criticisms, incubators are making a
considerable contribution to their tenants, mainly by
reducing operating costs, the survey shows. While
three-quarters of the respondents had annual sales of less
than $100,000 upon entering an incubator -- including 40%
started from scratch there -- only 18% have sales under that
level today. (Many of the respondents have since graduated
from incubators.) Nearly a quarter now have more than $1
million in sales.
   The study also shows an increase in employment at
incubator companies. Of the survey respondents, only 1% had
10 or more workers when they entered the incubator. Today,
34% have attained this level.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ONE OUT OF EVERY eight small businesses in the country is
in California, says a new study by Wells Fargo Bank, San
Francisco. These businesses, defined as having fewer than 50
employees, accounted for one out of every three jobs created
in the state in the past decade, the bank adds. . . . More
small businesses are turning to partial self-insurance as a
way to hold down skyrocketing costs of their health-coverage
premiums, according to the March issue of "BrainTrust," a
joint publication of Laventhol &amp; Horwath and Mark Stevens
Features.
