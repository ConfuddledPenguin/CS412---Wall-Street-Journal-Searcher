   NEW YORK -- U.S. traders followed the lead of Japanese and
European foreign exchange markets in bidding the dollar
higher yesterday on rising U.S. interest rates and new
worries about the effects of the monetary union of the
Germanys.
   The dollar briefly tested the 1.70-mark level three times
during the New York day before falling back on a lack of
follow-through buying.

   But trading was termed thin, with participants hesitant to
push the dollar aggressively higher after seeing it
repeatedly fail to hold gains against the mark and yen in
recent sessions. The market used the scheduled release of
U.S. economic data today and Friday as an excuse to avoid
taking new positions, said Ty Tan, a dealer at Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank in New York.
   Long-term Treasury bond yields continued to inch toward
the psychologically important 9% level. Late in the New York
business day, the yield had risen to 8.96% from Friday's
8.94%.
   Durable goods orders for March, due for release today, are
seen up 1.7% from February, and the preliminary report on
first-quarter gross national product, estimated to show a
2.3% annual growth rate, is scheduled for release Friday.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6995 marks, up from 1.6875 marks late Friday, and at
157.60 yen, up from 157.45 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6356, down from $1.6388 Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.05 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 157.55 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.7025 marks.
   On Monday, the U.S. unit's strength against the mark
derived from news that the West German government had
outlined plans to convert East German mark-denominated wages
and pensions at a one-toone rate with the West German mark,
participants said. Over the weekend, the conversion rate had
been brought into the spotlight again by a report in Der
Spiegel magazine forecasting a broader application of the
one-to-one rate than that proposed by the West German central
bank.
   The mark also was hurt by a 2.5% plunge in prices on the
Frankfurt stock market.
   That the dollar is testing 1.70 marks is of more
psychological importance than anything else, said Thomas
Palladino, a vice president at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V.
in New York.
   The market has switched its focus from the dollar-yen rate
to dollar-mark dealings as monetary union creeps closer and
the troubles in Lithuania highlight the dollar's role as a
safe-haven currency, Mr. Palladino said.
   Concern about the inflation that might result in West
Germany from the conversion of so many East German marks to
West German marks at a one-to-one rate also prompted selling
of the mark against other currencies, particularly the yen,
participants said.
   After falling from 93.35 yen late Friday in New York to
92.99 yen at the close of Tokyo trading yesterday, the mark
slipped further to 92.89 yen at the London close yesterday,
finishing the global day in New York at 92.70 yen.
   With activity firmly fixed on the dollarmark rate,
dealings in the dollar-yen area remained static, traders
said.
   The U.S. currency is seen remaining stuck in a narrow band
against the yen, with no large moves likely until the level
of Japanese participation in the Treasury's refunding is
revealed next month.
   There is some fear in the market that Japanese investors
might scale back their participation in the refunding from
previous auctions. This anxiety stems from rumors that the
Japanese Ministry of Finance requested insurance companies to
restrain their purchases of dollar-denominated assets.
   Tokyo participants said yesterday they expect Japanese
participation at the U.S. auction to be lower than
previously, but not markedly so.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $378.90 an ounce, up $2.30. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $378.25 an ounce.
