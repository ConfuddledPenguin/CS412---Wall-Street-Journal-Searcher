   TOLEDO, Ohio -- Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. said its
board elected Max O. Weber chief executive officer to succeed
William W. Boeschenstein, 64 years old, who will retire in
September. Mr. Boeschenstein will remain a director.
   Mr. Weber, 60, joined Owens-Corning in 1955. He was named
president and chief operating officer in 1988 and will
continue to serve in that capacity after succeeding Mr.
Boeschenstein Oct. 1.

   Mr. Weber takes over a company that went through a major
recapitalization four years ago. The maker of home insulation
and construction products reported net income of $32 million,
or 76 cents a share, for the first quarter, 5.9% lower than a
year earlier. Last year's net income dropped 9%, which the
company attributed to an economic slowdown in the U.S. that
affected its construction, automotive and pleasure-boat
markets.
