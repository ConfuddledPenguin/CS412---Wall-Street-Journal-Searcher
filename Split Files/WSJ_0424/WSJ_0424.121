   Digital Equipment Corp., continuing its stock buy-back
program, said its board authorized the purchase of as many as
five million, or 4.1%, of its common shares on the open
market.
   Digital's stock, which rose last week after it reported
mildly positive third-quarter results, closed yesterday at
$83.25, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.

   The Maynard, Mass., computer maker has purchased 18
million shares of its common for $2.1 billion over the past
several years. In announcing the latest buy-back
authorization, Digital asserted that the current market price
of its stock "does not reflect the underlying strengths of
the company."
   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc., said
Digital's buy-back announcement didn't affect its stock much
partly because investors didn't interpret it as "a signal
that Digital's business is starting to get stronger." He
added that the indicated $415 million share repurchase "isn't
a very large buy-back, given that Digital has $2.2 billion of
cash."
