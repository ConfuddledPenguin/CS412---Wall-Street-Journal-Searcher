   PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. slashed its
quarterly common stock dividend 45% and announced an
aggressive $100 million cost-cutting program to offset a rate
increase that was disallowed by state regulators last week.
   The company also reported a first-quarter net loss of $60
million, or 40 cents a share. The loss was caused primarily
by a one-time charge of $250 million, or $1.18 a share. The
charge stems from various investments disallowed by the
Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission.

   The quarterly dividend was cut to 30 cents a share from 55
cents. The utility's management had been warning investors
for more than a year that a dividend cut was likely if the
company didn't receive the $549 million rate increase it had
requested to recoup its investment in building and operating
its Limerick No. 2 nuclear power station.
   Yet Philadelphia Electric shares fell 75 cents to $15.75
as more than 1.1 million shares changed hands in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   Doris Kelley Aloston at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said the new
lower dividend "is secure. It {Philadelphia Electric} can
manage to pay it long term."
   Daniel Scotto, a bond analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp., said the dividend cut should save
the company about $208 million annually. He estimated that
such savings should pump up the company's cash flow, which is
good news for Philadelphia Electric's bondholders. Mr. Scotto
upgraded his bond rating on the utility after the dividend
cut and cost-reduction program were announced.
   Joseph F. Paquette Jr., Philadelphia Electric's chairman
and chief executive officer, said the company believes it can
achieve the proposed $100 million in expense cuts without
having to lay off non-management employees or cut their
salaries. However, the company's top 70 to 80 executives
won't be spared. Their salaries will be cut between 2% to
10%, including a 10% pay cut for Mr. Paquette. The retainer
fee for directors also will be reduced by 10%.
   Philadelphia Electric plans to reduce staff through an
early-retirement plan and by cutting back on contract
workers. Mr. Paquette said some $70 million to $80 million of
its cost-reduction plan will come from labor savings. The
rest should be achieved through more efficient purchasing
practices. The company also plans to reduce its capital
spending, but it hasn't targeted specific areas yet.
   Mr. Paquette said a second phase of the cost-cutting
program, which the company will undertake probably in early
1992, will entail an analysis of its work activity to find
various tasks that can be reorganized or consolidated,
allowing the utility to reduce workers without sacrificing
productivity or service. Philadelphia Electric doesn't have
an estimate on the savings it'll achieve under the second
phase.
