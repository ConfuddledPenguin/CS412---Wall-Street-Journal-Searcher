   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission
agreed to investigate a complaint by SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics Inc. that its patents are being infringed by
imports of computer memory chips made by a South Korean
company.
   SGS-Thomson, based in Carrollton, Texas, said Hyundai
Electronics Industries Co. and its California-based
subsidiary, Hyundai Electronics America, infringed on its
patents. The U.S. company is asking the ITC to ban the
offending imports, which include several types of dynamic
random access memories, or DRAMs, and static random access
memories, or SRAMs.

   SGS-Thomson, which is jointly owned by Thomson SA of
France and Istituto per la Recostruzione Industriale of
Italy, is the successor to Mostek Corp., which registered the
U.S. patents at the center of the controversy in the 1970s
and 1980s.
   The complaint is the first trade action taken by any U.S.
semiconductor producer against imports from South Korea. The
U.S. industry has been apprehensive there would be a surge of
computer-chip imports from South Korea, which recently has
increased its semiconductor production capacity.
   SGS-Thomson also has filed a lawsuit in federal district
court in Texas against Hyundai. In the suit, filed Feb. 27,
SGS-Thomson is seeking money damages and a permanent
injunction to halt alleged patent infringements.
   Separately, acting on another trade complaint, the ITC
decided to investigate charges by Ingersoll-Rand Co., a New
Jersey maker of power-tools, that its U.S. trademarks
covering "air-impact" wrenches have been infringed by
manufacturers in Taiwan and by Astro Pneumatic Tool Co., Los
Angeles, which distributes the Taiwan-made wrenches in the
U.S.
