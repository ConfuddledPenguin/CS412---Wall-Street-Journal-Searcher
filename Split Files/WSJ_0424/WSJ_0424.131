   NEW YORK -- Bond prices slipped for the seventh
consecutive trading session, as investors continued to sell
bonds on fears that this week's slate of economic indicators
will provide more negative news for bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which lost 3 1/2
points last week, or $35 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, ended only 1/4 point lower yesterday. Yields on the
benchmark bond rose to about 8.96%, highest in nearly a year.
Last week's rout was triggered by a sharp rise in inflation.

   "Sentiment is horrible," said Michael Moore, a trading
manager at Continental Bank. He said several economic
indicators are due out this week, but that investors are most
anxious about three of them: First-quarter employment cost
index and durable goods orders, both due today, and Friday's
advance estimate of first-quarter gross national product.
   The consensus view of economists is for an annual
inflation-adjusted growth rate of 2.5% for GNP, twice as high
as earlier estimates. Orders for durable goods in March are
expected to have rebounded sharply, while employment costs
are expected to have increased 5.2% in the first quarter.
   Although such reports are considered positive for the
economy and certain workers, they disturb bondholders because
rising inflation and faster economic growth sometimes leads
to higher interest rates. Inflation and higher interest
rates, in turn, reduce the value of bonds.
   Moreover, investors are concerned about the market's
ability to absorb about $30 billion of bonds that the
Treasury department plans to sell early next month in its
quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
   With so many potential land mines, traders said many
investors are staying away from the market.
   However, Mr. Moore said he noticed a modest pickup in
"some selected buying" activity which may have kept the
market's losses relatively small.
   "The pace at which the market is declining has started to
slow," said Mr. Moore. "It was the first day in some time
that we've seen some buying by institutional investors," he
said.
   Another reason prices didn't fall more sharply yesterday,
according to several traders, was that there were no rumors
of large-scale selling by Japanese investors.
   Bonds were unchanged to slightly lower in light activity
in early trading. But prices suddenly turned moderately lower
in midafternoon on news that a few investment firms placed
large "put" orders for bond futures. A "put" option is a
futures contract that allows the buyer to sell Treasury bonds
in the future for a price that is set at the time the
contract is placed. Essentially, the put buyer is betting
that prices will fall.
   When trading is brisk, a few large put orders could go
unnoticed in the market. But, when trading is quiet, such as
it was yesterday, a few large put sales can force bond
holders to sell.
   "When the market is not very solid, it can be easily
pushed by one or a few large-scale put orders," said John
Slosberg, a senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data
Global Markets Group.
   Despite the concerns about next month's quarterly
refunding, tomorrow's sale of $10.5 billion of new two-year
notes is expected to go smoothly.
   Investors who unloaded bonds during last week's selling
frenzy might want to park their cash in relatively short
securities that are less affected by inflation worries, and
the new two-year notes should benefit as a result, some
analysts said.
   "There may be some yield-curve arbitrage interest in
buying two-year notes and selling longer-dated maturities,"
said Richard Kelly of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   In when-issued activity, the new two-year notes were
yielding 8.84%, up slightly from late Friday in New York.
   Separately, the Public Securities Association, a trade
group, said an "advisory panel" formed in February has
developed recommendations for "speeding the development of
any proposed industry joint ventures" to disseminate U.S.
Treasury securities price information.
   The panel, headed by William Brachfeld of Daiwa Securities
America Inc., will disclose its recommendations to the PSA's
Primary Dealers Committee at the association's spring meeting
later this week. A report is expected to be issued by PSA
"within a few weeks."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted at about 95 4/32 to
yield 8.96% compared with 95 11/32 to yield 8.935% on Friday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of about 96 25/32
to yield 8.98% compared with 97 to yield 8.94% on Friday.
   Treasury bill rates moved higher when compared with last
week at the government's weekly bill auction.
   The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury
bills was 7.78% and the average rate on six-month bills was
7.91%. That was up from last week's auction, when they were
7.71% and 7.75%, respectively.
   The Federal Farm Credit Banks issued $250 million offering
of four-year notes. The notes were priced at par to yield
9.25% through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. The notes, which are noncallable for two years, will
be reoffered at various prices.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   News that Philadelphia Electric Co. slashed its annual
common stock dividend nearly in half to $1.20 a share sparked
buying interest in the company's bonds.
   While Philadelphia Electric common stock fell 3/4 point to
15 3/4, the bonds rose between 1/2 and 3/4 point. Traders at
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. said
Philadelphia Electric's bellwether 9.25% notes due 1999 ended
at 95 3/4, up 3/4 point.
   Dan Scotto, a DLJ analyst, said the price rise "was purely
based on the amount of cash that will be retained by the
company," as a result of the dividend cut. Mr. Scotto, who
issued a credit-rating upgrade on the company yesterday
morning, estimates that the utility's internally generated
cash should rise by more than $250 million.
   Most other investment-grade corporate bonds ended
unchanged.
   In the junk bond market, prices ended unchanged to about
1/4 point lower in extremely light trading.
   Among the notable exceptions to the market's downward bias
were junk bonds of Supermarkets General Holdings Inc. which
continued to firm after last week's news that the company's
loss narrowed significantly in the first quarter.
   Supermarkets General's 14 1/2% senior subordinated notes,
due in 1997, were quoted 1/2 point higher at 90. The bonds
had surged three points Friday.
   Junk bond traders said news that junk bond financier
Michael Milken will agree to plead guilty to six felony
counts and pay $600 million in fines and restitution didn't
have an effect on the market.
   Although Mr. Milken is largely credited with creating the
junk bond market under the aegis of now defunct Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., he has played an almost negligible role
in the market during the past two years.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities traded in a two-tiered market, as
discount issues fared poorly while premium issues rose.
   Traders said there was talk of a seller of discount
securities as well as buyers of premium issues.
   The poor performance of discount Government National
Mortgage Association issues reflected the bearish market
environment. These issues have long average lives, low
current yields and relatively tight spreads above Treasury
issues.
   Ginnie Mae 9% securities for May delivery ended at 93
29/32, down 10/32; its 9 1/2% securities at 94 15/32, down
9/32; and its 10% securities at 99 1/32, down 8/32. In
contrast, Ginnie Mae's 11% issue was unchanged at 103 10/32;
its 12 1/2% issue was up 1/4 at 109 4/32; and the 13% issue
gained 10/32 to 110 1/2.
   Securities issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
Federal National Mortgage Association fared better than
Ginnie Maes because they were in demand from underwriters of
derivative securities and because they have shorter average
lives than the Ginnie Maes.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to 1/4 point lower
in listless trading, with some bonds down 1/2 point.
   Uncertainty over whether Treasury issues are in for
further declines pushed municipals lower for the fifth
straight session, while keeping most participants on the
sidelines, traders said.
   In the new-issue arena, a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. group priced
a $60 million issue of Missouri Environmental Improvement and
Energy Resources Authority revenue bonds, Union Electric Co.
project, to yield 7.57% in 2020.
   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20%
bonds due in 2018 were off 1/4 point at 96 3/8 to yield
7.48%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Major European bond markets slumped in reaction to
Friday's downturn in the U.S. bond market.
   Traders said West German, British and French government
bonds fell at the start of trading yesterday, which was the
first chance that European traders have had to react to the
sharp one-point decline in U.S. bond prices that occurred on
Friday.
   Traders said British bond prices were also bid lower due
to talk of expected turmoil in the labor markets this summer
as transportation and electricity workers push for high wage
settlements. Some analysts are forecasting an inflation rate
of 10%, up from the current rate of about 8.1%.
   At the end of trading yesterday, French bonds had
recovered the bulk of their losses, but Britain's benchmark
long-term bond closed 1/4 point lower while West Germany's
benchmark 10-year bond finished about 1/2 point lower.
   In Japan, uncertainty about today's expected auction of
new 10-year Japanese government bonds kept the market trading
in a narrow range with bond prices ended slightly weaker. The
yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond was 7.32% and the
price was down 0.11 at 86.22.
