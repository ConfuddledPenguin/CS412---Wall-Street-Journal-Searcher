   IRVINE, Calif. -- AST Research Inc. is suddenly a hot
property in both DRAMs and diplomacy. In business 10 years,
America's ninth-largest computer maker has seen its stock
price double from where it started this year, on the basis of
a sharp bounce-back in earnings. And because of a bold
venture into Japan, the company has emerged as a trade token
-- the Motorola of the '90s, perhaps -- in the progressing
brinksmanship between the Pacific's economic giants.
   All of that makes Safi Qureshey, 38, AST's founding
president and CEO, a man whose take on developments in
Washington and Tokyo might offer some front-lines feedback.
It turns out that, politically, he seems to be a circuitry
mix.

   Right now he's preoccupied with trying to get before
Japanese customers the personal computer AST has designed to
compete with that nation's dominant NEC line. After what Mr.
Qureshey says was an investment of $2 million over the past
two years, AST can sell a PC that matches NEC's
specifications (and is a little faster than AST's
three-year-old model on which this column is written) but is
also compatible with most American software. This, he says,
would allow Japanese users immediate access to 10 times the
program choices they'd otherwise have.
   AST says its problem is that Sharp Corp., the Japanese
giant that was to sell the American product under its name
and through its distribution channels, is balking. Having had
a look "at what we have done, maybe some people at Sharp are
saying `we can do it ourselves,' in which case, they have
wasted a lot of our time," Mr. Qureshey laments. (A Sharp
spokesman in the U.S. says its executives in Japan express
unawareness of such talks.)
   Mr. Qureshey thinks he may have less than a year's head
start left on the technology. So, after Stephen Kreider Yoder
broke the news of the line in the Journal on April 10, AST
held a press briefing in Tokyo to "broadcast a message" to
consumers and substitute partners there.
   The presence of a Commerce Department official at AST's
Tokyo roadshow was significant to the company and, it
maintains, to Japanese perceptions. The point was underlined
last week when Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher himself
visited AST here in Orange County. Mr. Qureshey says he's
hired 13 support staffers in Japan and followed all the
technical and protocol rules in bringing his PC to the brink
of the world's second-largest market -- "we made that initial
effort so that we don't get accused like the rest of {this}
country of being lazy, or just complaining." Thus a failure
to enter could result only from artificial barriers. He longs
for the day when a Computerland chain in Japan could sell his
wares.
   In getting to free trade, which he says is the natural
preference of an innovative industry such as his, Mr.
Qureshey welcomes Washington's involvement in some areas and
decries it in others:
   He supports a Securities Industry Association petition to
cite Japan as an unfair trader in semiconductors under the
"Super 301" provision of the trade law. Such action "builds a
case" that can be helpful to his own selling efforts. Mr.
Qureshey speaks of American consumers as being synonymous in
interest with U.S. exporters: "Japan has to look at us as
being their biggest customer. How do you take care of your
customers?"
   Nevertheless, he opposes managed trade as represented by
the U.S.-Japan semiconductor pact of the mid-1980s. That was
an instance of "one company" pushing through import limits
that adversely affected most of high-tech, he says, prompting
more products to be built offshore while U.S. makers paid and
charged higher prices and suffered a spate of thefts from
precious chip inventories.
   Though he thinks protectionists such as Rep. Dick Gephardt
(D., Mo.) go too far, he says the good cop/bad cop routine of
the administration and Congress on trade helps to budge
Tokyo. The Toshiba-bashing a few years ago, merited or not,
"had a good effect."
   Relaxing U.S. antitrust rules would help American chip
makers share production-cost burdens, but government
sponsorship of entities such as the ill-fated U.S. Memories
is welcome, too, says this buyer of what would be subsidized
semiconductors.
   Why should taxpayers help to finance high-tech? Mr.
Qureshey says they do the same for other exporters, such as
wheat, that have less strategic importance. Grain
relationships begin anew with each contract, he explains,
whereas "if you sell them a thousand tractors or a thousand
computers, they're somewhat dependent on you for continuity."
Again, commercial interests are equated with national
interests in his mind.
   During a February market inspection of the Soviet Union,
Mr. Qureshey says, "all I saw were Taiwanese products. They
say `we want to buy American products, but we can't afford
them.' " Washington should help to grease "selective" deals.
But the most important favor it could render high-tech, and
the cause that actually brought him together with Commerce
before the Japan venture broke, is the relaxation of export
controls slapped on for national-security reasons. AST must
pay "really high-cost" personnel to monitor compliance, he
complains, adding, "if you visit one of our Taiwanese
competitors, you will not find any such person of that
caliber, sitting there adding overhead."
   The list of woes goes on, including the high relative cost
of capital in the U.S. (although he doesn't mention the
capital-gains tax until asked). But the Pakistan-born Mr.
Qureshey does acknowledge a big advantage of the American
industry: immigration. Not only were he and the other two
founders of AST from abroad, but nearly 10% of his engineers
are immigrants, he estimates. U.S. colleges are magnets for
such talent; Mr. Qureshey holds a degree from the University
of Texas. In addition, U.S. firms have an easier time
shuttling workers at foreign affiliates into the home
country.
   "We are still the most creative nation. Simply from a
high-tech point of view, we {gain} a tremendous leap" from
immigration, he says. "The Germanys {of the world} will
realize that trying to keep such a homogeneous population has
some drawbacks that they may not have realized."
   A different immigration boon is evident at AST's U.S.
production facility in Fountain Valley, 10 miles away from
the headquarters. Located closer to where the workers can
afford to live, the plant is near Little Saigon, the largest
Vietnamese community in the U.S. Customer service, testing
and a supply depot also are here, and employees of those
units are a typical Orange County mix, but most of the
assembly force -- at $5.50 to $6.50 an hour -- appears to be
Asian. The work is routine, but requires attention to detail.
   AST screens new hires for drugs use. John Olson, vice
president for operations, grumbled that recently five of six
applicants for warehousing had failed. And how many aspirants
for the assembly line had been "kicked out"? None.

   In yesterday's Business World column, an unfair trading
allegation against Japan was incorrectly attributed to the
Securities Industry Association. The petitioner is the
Semiconductor Industry Association.
