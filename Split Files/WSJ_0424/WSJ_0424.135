   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Bankruptcy Court Judge James Yacos
confirmed a plan by Northeast Utilities to acquire Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire for about $2.3 billion.
   The judge's endorsement of the reorganization plan for PS
New Hampshire follows its approval last month by the
company's shareholders and creditors.

   The bankruptcy settlement is still subject to approval by
New Hampshire state regulators of Northeast's plan for 5.5%
annual rate increases over seven years. State regulators
recently began hearings on the request; the "target date" for
their decision is the end of June, according to a spokesman
for Hartford, Conn.-based Northeast.
   The acquisition of PS New Hampshire by Northeast also will
be subject to review by federal regulators. Northeast will,
however, begin supervising the New Hampshire utility's
operations as of April 30, a spokesman for PS New Hampshire
said.
