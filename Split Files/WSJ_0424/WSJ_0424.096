   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,
aided by a debt swap, said first-quarter net income surged
sevenfold to $37.7 million, or $1.71 a share, from a restated
$5.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Financial Corp. said the increase was the result of
restructuring efforts that included an equity-for-debt swap.
The swap lifted Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Association, the
principle subsidiary of Financial Corp., out of insolvency,
although the S&amp;L remains significantly undercapitalized with
tangible capital of 0.6%.

   Under last summer's thrift-rescue bill, thrifts are
required to maintain a tangible capital ratio of 1.5%
currently and of 3% by the end of 1994. Tangible capital is
the excess of real assets, excluding intangible assets such
as good will, over liabilities.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Financial Corp. stock closed at 15.625 cents, unchanged.
   In a statement, Philip R. Brinkerhoff, Financial Corp.'s
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the
company will continue to "aggressively pursue opportunities
to increase capital, including capital infusion or sale."
   The company's restructuring efforts included a debt swap
in January that resulted in an extraordinary gain of $36.5
million and a $50 million addition to tangible capital. The
exchange offer provided for the company to issue 17 million
new common shares for preferred stock, subordinated
debentures and notes.
   The year-earlier quarter was restated to recognize a
one-time $3.2 million gain from a change in accounting
methods, Financial Corp. said. The financial-services concern
has assets of $4.3 billion.
