   NORWICH FINANCIAL Corp., citing a quarterly loss because
of problem loans, reduced its quarterly dividend 67% to five
cents a share from 15 cents. The Norwich, Conn., bank holding
company said the dividend is payable May 18 to stock of
record May 4. Norwich yesterday posted a first-quarter loss
of $14.3 million, or $2.75 a share, including a provision for
loan losses during the quarter of $16.5 million, compared
with year-earlier profit of $1.4 million, or 25 cents a
share. Norwich said its loan-loss provision reflected
"concerns over the continuing deterioration in the commercial
real estate market in Connecticut" and other factors. "In
view of the current loss, under state statute, the company is
unable to maintain a 15-cent {a share} quarterly dividend
throughout 1990 without regulatory approval," Norwich said.
The company said it expects to continue paying a quarterly
dividend of five cents a share throughout this year.
