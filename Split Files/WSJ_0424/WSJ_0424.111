   Driven to losses by the Northeast's real estate slump,
Howard Savings Bank, announced a plan to return to
profitability by cutting staff, raising service fees and
reducing nonperforming loans.
   At the Newark, N.J., bank's annual meeting, Leo J. Rogers
Jr., president, confirmed his projection last month of a
$17.5 million loss for the first quarter. The loss resulted
from the addition of $29.5 million to the bank's allowance
for possible loan losses during the quarter. In the
year-earlier quarter, Howard Savings Bank earned $8.5
million, or 59 cents a share.

   Mr. Rogers said that about 10% of the current work force
of about 1,700 would be let go, with about 100 employees
offered early retirement at full pensions and other
reductions coming "through attrition." He said the bank's
first priority is to control and reduce nonperforming loans,
which will be supervised by the recently hired chief credit
officer, a new post.
   Mr. Rogers said Howard Savings will concentrate on
residential mortgages, home equity and other consumer loans
for the rest of the year.
