   THIRD WORLD'S CHILD LABOR

   Millions of children are working the streets of Third
World cities, shining shoes, washing cars or prostituting
themselves, the International Labor Organization reported.
   "Youngsters working as household domestic servants may be
the most vulnerable and exploited children of all and the
most difficult to protect," the ILO said.
   The 60-page ILO report said improvements in industrialized
nations had yet to penetrate the Third World, where areas of
child exploitation remained hidden from public scrutiny.
"Their existence is often kept under a tight veil of secrecy
and isolation," it said.
   Among positive developments, the ILO reported a decline of
child labor in mills and factories of mainstream industries,
chiefly because modern technology required skilled or
semiskilled manpower.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S LISTLESS ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   China's listless economy won't begin to recover until the
second half of the year, jeopardizing the nation's
industrial-growth target of 5% to 6% this year, said Zhang
Zhongji of the State Statistical Bureau. He said that the
economy had failed to respond to pump-priming measures during
the first quarter and that loans intended to bolster slumping
industries had contributed mainly to further overstocking of
unsold products. "There has been no fundamental change in . .
. stagnation in industrial production and poor economic
efficiency," Mr. Zhang said.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPE'S LARGEST GAS STATION
                                                                                                       

   Deutsche BP AG will build a gas station in Dresden, East
Germany, that will be the largest gas station in Europe,
according to the East German news agency ADN. The West German
unit of British Petroleum PLC will also be the first West
German company to build a gas station in East Germany when it
constructs a 48-pump station near the Dresden-North Autobahn.
The station will be under a 5,000-square-foot roof and will
offer eight different types of fuel, ADN said.
                                                                                                       

   SONY TO INCREASE IMPORTS
                                                                                                       

   Sony Corp. announced a plan to increase imports and
overseas production over the next four years. Joining other
Japanese companies that recently announced similar programs,
Sony said it intends to increase its imports 3.5 times by the
end of fiscal 1993, to 120 billion yen ($762.6 million) from
their fiscal 1989 level of 34.3 billion yen. Imports would
include Sony color televisions from the U.S., audio equipment
from Asia and audio and video software from the company's CBS
Records Inc. and Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
subsidiaries.
                                                                                                       

   CANADA'S GREEN INDICATORS
                                                                                                       

   The Canadian government has established a task force to
develop a set of 20 to 30 "green" indicators that will give
the public a regular report on the state of the environment.
Canadian officials said the indicators could ultimately be
linked with traditional economic statistics to help
illustrate whether an economic upturn is being made at the
expense of the environment. Anne Kerr, heading the task force
for Environment Canada, said it's doubtful the group will
come up with an overall "green index" but instead plans to
devise several indicators to track such basics as the quality
of water and air.
                                                                                                       

   `ECONOMIC TERRORISTS' IN IRAN
                                                                                                       

   To combat consumer shortages, Iran's parliament approved
the death penalty for people convicted of hoarding,
profiteering and black-market dealings, Tehran Radio
reported. The broadcast said that "if profiteering or
hoarding is meant to counter the Islamic Republic's
establishment, the profiteer and hoarder will be executed."
Iranian officials call such individuals "economic
terrorists."
                                                                                                       

   DOING BUSINESS WITH VIETNAM
                                                                                                       

   The Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce
adopted a resolution urging the Bush administration to lift
restrictions preventing Americans from doing business with
Vietnam.
   The council, which represents 19 chamber chapters in the
Asia-Pacific area, said it supported "immediate removal of
restrictions on U.S. trade and investment with Vietnam." The
economic sanctions, it said, "severely impact American
competitiveness in the region."
   There has been only one known exception to the U.S.
embargo, which has blocked trade since the fall of South
Vietnam's U.S.-supported government in 1975. In January, the
Atlanta-based Cable News Network, a unit of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., was allowed to provide ground
receivers that will enable Vietnam to pick up CNN's satellite
signals.
   The Bush administration is adamant that ties with Vietnam
stay severed until, among other steps, Hanoi agrees to
on-site verification that Vietnamese soldiers have left
Cambodia.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A senior Chinese police official said international
terrorists were planning to sabotage the Asian Games in
Beijing this September. Liu Wen, a top official for combating
terrorism, said, "To prevent terrorism {at the games}, we
have ordered our police units to guard against this and asked
our international friends for help." . . . Christian leaders
in Israel ordered all their holy sites to close this Friday
for one day to protest Israeli government support for a new
Jewish settlement in Jerusalem's Christian quarter.
