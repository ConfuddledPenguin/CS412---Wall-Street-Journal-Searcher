   Ashland Oil Inc., squeezed by weak refinery margins,
reported profit of $913,000, or two cents a share, for the
second quarter ended March 31. That compares with a year-ago
loss of $13.8 million, or 25 cents a share, which included a
$9 million charge related to an arbitration settlement
between Ashland's Riley Stoker Corp. unit and a customer.
   Sales rose 11% to $1.97 billion from $1.78 billion.

   The Ashland, Ky., oil refiner said refinery margins -- the
difference between crude-oil prices and petroleum products --
were strong in January but deteriorated badly in February,
resulting in a $2.3 million operating loss at its Ashland
Petroleum unit.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ashland stock closed at $35.50 a share, down 50 cents.
