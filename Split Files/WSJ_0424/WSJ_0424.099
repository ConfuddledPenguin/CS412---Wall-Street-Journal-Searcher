   A rebound in world oil prices continued on hopes of
production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   A rally that had exploded briefly last week on OPEC's
announcement of a May 2 meeting in Geneva resumed yesterday
in European trading and then spread to the U.S.

   In European spot and futures trading, North Sea Brent
crudes advanced as much as 50 cents a barrel. In U.S. futures
trading, crude prices were up as much as 25 cents a barrel.
Firm crude futures helped lift other fuels as well with the
May contract for unleaded gasoline up 1.61 cents a gallon to
settle at 63.54 cents.
   "It seemed that the Brent market got the thing going,"
said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy futures broker.
"It was the typical pattern before an OPEC meeting," he
added, "with the market running up in anticipation of the
results."
   The major anticipated result of the meeting of OPEC's
market monitoring committee -- all 13 oil ministers are
expected to be there -- is that there will be some curbing of
the overproduction that brought oil prices to a near-collapse
earlier this month. The idea is to achieve output reductions
over May and June, at least, to get past the second quarter,
usually a weak period for oil demand.
   Yesterday, the perception that OPEC will be able to
achieve voluntary output reductions at least for those months
appeared to be spreading among oil-market participants. Also,
the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported that
leading Persian Gulf members may be prepared to agree to a 5%
production cut if it is for all of OPEC. That would be equal
to more than one million barrels a day.
   There were also some technical factors at work in the oil
markets yesterday. One trader noted that after the June West
Texas Intermediate contract hit the $19.10 level on the New
York Mercantile Exchange "there was very aggressive buying."
   Many traders later took profits. Still, the June WTI
contract settled 25 cents higher at $19.07 a barrel. July
crude was up 20 cents to $19.51.
   Further evidence of firming crude prices came in the
fields, where several refiners increased postings $1 a barrel
to $18 for West Texas Intermediate. Amoco Corp., which had
been posting $16 a barrel, increased the prices it will pay
for WTI by $2 to $18.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures prices settled
higher and the nearby contracts rose their limits in response
to a bullish inventory report issued by the Agriculture
Department on Friday that disclosed that fewer bellies were
stored than expected. According to the report, as of April 1
there were 97.5 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in
storage, while most analysts had expected 100 million pounds
on hand. "The bullish interpretation of the total frozen pork
bellies and higher hog prices at the terminal markets helped
to push hog prices higher," said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. Charles Levitt, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said the
overall action in the market was robust "as we continue to
feel the effects of strong demand for all meats during the
first quarter." Cattle futures prices closed mixed in the
wake of the bearish government report that showed that more
cattle was placed onto feedlots during March, which led
August and October contracts lower. "The report showed an
aggressive market pace during the first quarter, which helped
the nearby June contract, but also showed a larger placement
figure of young animals on feedlots in the first quarter than
anticipated," said Mr. Levitt.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply, more than
erasing Friday's gains. The May contract declined 5.85 cents
a pound to $1.8965. The May contract on Friday rose 1.75
cents. The approach of the first day for the issuance of
notices on May 1 to deliver the concentrate against May
futures contracts may have contributed to the selling,
according to Judith Ganes, senior analyst for Merrill Lynch,
New York. Technical considerations also played a factor in
the substantial drop, as liquidation of May contracts
significantly increased when the price dropped below $1.90,
she said. However, Ms. Ganes added, the fundamentals of the
market didn't appear to justify the severe price decline. A
report late Thursday showed the amount of supply moving out
of Florida to the retail sector was more than one million
gallons a week, apparently indicating that consumer
resistance to higher prices wasn't as strong as had been
expected, Ms. Ganes said. Also, supplies may tighten in
coming months, she said. The Florida orange crop hasn't
recovered from the Christmas freeze and Brazil's harvest is
expected to be lower than last season's record output, Ms.
Ganes said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum futures prices rose sharply,
helping to pull up gold. July delivery platinum rose $7.70 an
ounce to $494.30. June gold was up $2.20 an ounce to $382.10.
May silver eased 0.80 cent an ounce to $5.10. Traders have
been preoccupied in recent weeks, said Nina Lipton, research
manager for the Platinum Group International, an industrial
group. Yesterday "they took a look at their charts and saw
that platinum has been oversold, particularly in the wake of
the sharp sell-off in gold in late March and they decided to
buy contracts," she said. Fundamentals also favor the buying
side, Ms. Lipton noted, particularly the strong demand for
the metal for environmental use, such as in automotive
catalytic converters. Another analyst noted that traders
still remain nervous over political tensions in South Africa,
which is the world's major supplier of platinum. Gold was
helped by the rise in platinum as well as a softening in the
securities markets, which could stimulate some demand for
gold as a safer haven, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were firm. The May contract rose
1.30 cents a pound to 75.31 cents. Today is the first day on
which notices to deliver cotton against the May contract will
be issued and traders bought back contracts they had
previously sold, causing prices to rise, said an analyst. He
noted that there is a tightness of supplies of better grades
of cotton in the U.S. Also, he said that Australia, a
significant supplier of good quality cotton to the world
market, has recently experienced heavy rains, which may have
hurt the quality of some of the cotton. Another analyst noted
that the rains in Australia came at a time when China is
perceived to have strong import needs and remains a potential
buyer of cotton. Expectations that U.S. economic growth will
continue to improve should keep domestic mills actively using
cotton, the analyst said. Industrial stocks have been down to
minimal levels for several months, causing mill demand for
cotton to continue strong, according to the analyst.
