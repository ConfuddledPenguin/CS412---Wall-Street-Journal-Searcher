   NEW YORK -- Asarco Inc. first-quarter net income fell 48%
on a 16% decline in sales, primarily because of lower prices
for copper, zinc and silver.
   The nonferrous metals company, which also has interests in
specialty chemicals, said net fell to $35.8 million, or 86
cents a share, from $68.6 million, or $1.63 a share, a year
earlier. The average price for copper was $1.14 a pound in
the quarter, compared with $1.42 a year ago. Copper sales
accounted for about 57% of Asarco's total sales in 1989. Lead
prices and volume, however, were higher in the quarter.

   The company said earnings also were affected by higher
interest expense on debt incurred and excess cash used to
fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases. Capital expenditures rose to $43.3 million from
$23.6 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   Sales fell to $521.2 million from $618.2 million.
   Results were within expectations, given the lower metals
prices, said Richard de J. Osborne, Asarco chairman,
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Osborne said
demand for copper, zinc and lead strengthened significantly
in March. He said supplies of those metals are tight, and the
outlook for demand is good.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Asarco closed at $25.625, down 50 cents.
