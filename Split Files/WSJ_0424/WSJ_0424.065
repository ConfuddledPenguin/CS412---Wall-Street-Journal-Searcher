   HOUSTON -- Harold S. Hook, it might be said, faces a
potential Tomato Plant Probem: One of the Seven Ports of
Management is trying to derail his Northbound Train. It's a
Cruel Sea, indeed.
   Loosely translated: Mr. Hook is stretched thin by
Torchmark Corp.'s proxy fight against American General Corp.

   Mr. Hook, American General's 58-year-old chairman,
invented these and 147 other buzzwords three decades ago to
teach his management theories to insurance company
colleagues. His copyrighted system, "Model-Netics," gave
workers a symbolic language to deal with business problems
and helped build American General into one of the nation's
biggest -- with $32 billion in assets -- and most profitable
life insurers by the mid-1980s.
   But now, after watching American General's earnings and
stock price stagnate for the last three years, Mr. Hook faces
perhaps the thorniest business problem of his career:
Persuading shareholders that his team, rather than
Torchmark's, is the best-equipped to get the company back on
track.
   From his perch atop American General's 43-story corporate
headquarters here, the portly yet boyish-looking executive is
directing an all-out assault against Torchmark, which is
trying to place five directors on American General's
15-member board. American General is fighting the effort in
federal court here and taking up the matter with insurance
regulators of 10 different states. And Mr. Hook and 50 top
managers are hitting the phones day and night to lobby
shareholders before the May 2 annual meeting.
   It isn't necessarily an easy sell, as even Mr. Hook
admits. "We've made no secret over the past two years that
we've been restructuring," he says, leaning forward in his
chair. "But the results have been difficult to understand."
   Indeed, while stock analysts generally praised American
General's decision to sell its property-liability and group
health operations last year for more than $900 million,
they've lambasted the company for failing to digest quickly
enough some of the big acquisitions it has made in the last
decade. Overhead remains high in American General's
bread-and-butter home service operations, and the company has
been slow to consolidate the consumer finance business it
bought from Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1988.
   Net income, meanwhile, tumbled 28% to $464 million, or
$3.76 a share, in 1989 from the company's high of $648
million, or $4.33 a share, in 1986. Over that period the
stock price drifted to $31.25, or a measly 84% of book value,
from the 1986 close of $36.88. In the first quarter, net
improved to $107.1 million, or 90 cents a share, from $97.2
million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.
   "There may be some true benefits forthcoming from
digesting acquisitions and consolidating operations," says
Herbert E. Goodfriend, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "But I think returns to stockholders on an
earnings and a total basis don't measure up to institutional
investors' expectations."
   Enter Torchmark. The brash, Birmingham, Ala., insurer, one
sixth the size of its target, burst onto the scene last month
with an unsolicited offer to buy American General for $50 a
share in cash and stock, or $6.3 billion. Investors seemed to
take the upstart seriously, bidding American General's shares
up to $40.25. Torchmark later dropped the bid in favor of a
proxy fight, but some on Wall Street are still rooting for a
merger.
   Among other things, some analysts think the two companies
would be a perfect fit, because both have big home-service
operations -- an unglamorous but cashrich business in which
salespeople peddle life insurance to poor and middle-income
families in their homes. And they also believe Torchmark's
cost-cutting success might rub off on American General.
   But Mr. Hook begs to differ. "It's like talking apples and
oranges" to compare cost structures, he asserts, because
Torchmark "is an organically grown company," while American
General grew by gobbling others. Its acquisitions of NLT
Corp. in 1982, for $1.5 billion and Gulf United's insurance
operations in 1984 for $1.2 billion, still rank as the
largest buy-outs in the life insurance industry. Such huge
mergers take time to fit, he argues; American General doesn't
expect to begin realizing big savings from a consolidation of
its two home-service hubs until early 1991.
   And Mr. Hook fears a merger might make the companies too
concentrated in home service and too debt-ridden. "Whether or
not a put-together would end up with two-plus-two equaling
five or two-plus-two equaling three would be an interesting
question," he says.
   Once regarded as the wunderkind of the insurance business,
Mr. Hook ran his first company at age 31. He became president
of American General in 1975 after the company, impressed with
his work as president of California-Western States Life
Insurance Co. in Sacramento, acquired controlling interest.
Three years later he was named chairman and chief executive.
   During the 1980s, Mr. Hook directed enormous changes in
the once-sleepy insurer, quintupling assets with acquisitions
of a consumer finance business and home service competitors,
among others, and then narrowed American General's focus by
shedding group health and property-liability lines.
   Mr. Hook also made a minor splash with his Model-Netics
management program, which he sold to other corporations and
government agencies through a company he owns in California,
Main Event Management Corp. Using jargon and pictographs that
call to mind some New Age religion, the program encourages
employees to pull in the same direction -- "The Northbound
Train" -- by giving them a common language to use in solving
problems.
   Adherents say Model-Netics has played a key role in
creating a unified corporate culture in American General's
patchwork-quilt of acquired subsidiaries. But not everyone is
impressed. The San Diego County government canceled an
experiment with Model-Netics a few years back after workers
protested. "I thought it was awful," says Barbara Collier, a
county training specialist, who called the jargon
"exclusionary."
   But devotees argue that the models boil down to common
sense. A Tomato Plant Problem, for example, is what you get
when you plant more seeds than you can water -- that is, when
you overextend yourself. The Seven Ports of Management
consist of the seven constituencies a manager answers to,
ranging from shareholders to customers to regulators. The
Cruel Sea describes the business environment.
   Lately, Mr. Hook has gotten a feel for just how cruel that
sea is. He argues that he's accomplished a "very tough
assignment" just by keeping earnings more or less level
during a period when American General is, in many ways,
reinventing itself. "It is a little frustrating," he says,
"because you can't expect to really be able to transmit that
in a few paragraphs."
