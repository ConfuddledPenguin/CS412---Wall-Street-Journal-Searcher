   CHULA VISTA, Calif. -- Rohr Industries Inc. said the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority agreed to pay
it $11 million to settle an eight-year-old lawsuit.
   Rohr said the payment will reimburse the aerospace
supplier for interest it paid to finance the manufacture of
300 subway cars for the transit authority under a 1972
contract.

   Rohr later sued the transit authority over defects in the
specifications for the subway cars, charging they cost the
company $54.3 million. Its claims for expenses, other than
for interest costs, were resolved earlier for $12.3 million.
