   WASHINGTON -- Not so fast.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last week took a
major step to open up the capital markets. But the Internal
Revenue Service may be reluctant to loosen a tax regulation
that some investors say still thwarts free global trade in
debt securities.

   This week the IRS will decide whether to permit a
newfangled bond that proponents say would complement the
spirit of the SEC's new Rule 144a by boosting
securities-market liquidity.
   In conversations with Wall Street tax lawyers, IRS and
Treasury officials have indicated they are reluctant to allow
the new bond, which would bridge the gap between the
different species of bonds sold in the U.S. and Europe.
   In 1982 Congress effectively eliminated the sale of bearer
bonds -- bonds that aren't registered in the name of the
holder -- to U.S. institutions or citizens. The worry was
that if securities couldn't be linked to their holder, the
holder might not pay taxes on the interest income.
   But the European market deals primarily in bearer debt. So
last summer the IRS asked for public comment on the idea of
allowing bonds that can be converted from non-bearer to
bearer form, so U.S. holders could easily trade securities
with Europeans and vice versa.
   The IRS was anticipating SEC enactment of Rule 144a, which
allows big investors to trade certain securities without
complying with U.S. reporting requirements. The new rule is
aimed at increasing liquidity in U.S. capital markets and
opening those markets to foreign companies, which have shied
away because of U.S. reporting requirements.
   If the IRS doesn't allow the convertible bond, "it will
tend to make the markets less efficient for foreign issuers
who are trying to use 144a," said Leslie Samuels, a partner
at the law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton in New
York. For example, he said, a foreign company would have to
pay a higher rate on its debt to attract a U.S. buyer because
the U.S. buyer would have trouble reselling the debt in the
European-bearer market.
   The new bond would "facilitate an easier trade," said Jon
Moldafsky, vice president of Meritus, a Los Angeles firm that
provides credit ratings and analysis for privately sold
securities.
   Some investors say the new SEC rule is so attractive to
foreigners that the remaining tax restrictions shouldn't
matter much.
   "The Europeans really want to tap the U.S. market," said
Heiko Thieme, a New York-based consultant to Deutsche Bank of
West Germany.
   And others say that foreign investors have become more
accustomed to holding non-bearer debt in recent years --
especially as the U.S. has turned overseas to fund its budget
deficit with non-bearer Treasury securities. "I don't believe
a favorable {IRS} ruling will have a big effect on the
liquidity of 144a issues," said Kenneth Lay, senior manager
in financial operations at the World Bank. Mr. Lay said about
two-thirds of a $1.5 billion World Bank offering of
non-bearer debt last September was purchased by foreigners.
   IRS and Treasury officials won't disclose the position
they plan to take. But in response to claims that the ability
to take advantage of the new SEC rule would be limited if the
IRS doesn't allow the convertible bond, a Treasury tax
official said, "You can argue against that -- the fact that
U.S. Treasury securities are issued in registered
{non-bearer} form in the overseas markets without much
trouble. . . . If we are talking about people who aren't into
tax avoidance, the anonymity the bearer debt permits isn't an
important factor."
