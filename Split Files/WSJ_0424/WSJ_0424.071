   WASHINGTON -- U.S. senators collectively received $96.3
million in campaign contributions from political action
committees sponsored by corporations and labor unions in a
recent six-year period, according to a study by Common Cause.
   The study, released the same week the Senate is expected
to begin debating ways to overhaul the campaign-finance
system, showed that 44 senators received more than $1 million
each from PACs during 1983-1988, the period studied by the
self-styled citizens lobby group.

   The Senate's leader in PAC contributions was Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, who received $2.5 million. Three other senators --
Pete Wilson (R., Calif.), Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) and Phil
Gramm (R., Texas) -- also received more than $2 million from
PACs.
   "Special-interest PACs have contributed tens of millions
of dollars to obtain special access and influence," said
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer.
   Financial-services industry PACs, including those
sponsored by savings and loan associations, were the biggest
corporate contributors, giving senators more than $8.5
million. Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich),
the subject of an ethics inquiry because of large
contributions he received from savings and loan executive
Charles Keating, was the Senate's top recipient from such
PACs, with $344,133.
   The second highest recipient from financial industry PACs
was Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), who received $309,433.
Sen. D'Amato is the subject of a Senate ethics inquiry that
focuses in part on campaign contributions he received from
executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D., Calif.), also under investigation for his ties to Mr.
Keating, received $209,195 from financial-industry PACS and
ranked ninth among beneficiaries of such groups.
   PACs representing oil and gas companies, utilities and
other energy interests gave senators more than $7 million.
Sen. Gramm was the top recipient with $382,103. The Texas
Republican also led in PAC contributions from real estate and
construction industry PACs, which gave him $193,874 out of a
total of $4.8 million contributed to senators.
   Insurance industry PACs gave a total of $45.7 million.
Sen. Bentsen was their top recipient with $213,900. PACs
representing food, restaurant and liquor associations gave a
total of $4.5 million; Sen. Gorton led with $147,182. Medical
and health industry PACs gave nearly $4 million, with Sen.
Dave Durenberger (R., Minn.) the top recipient with $156,061.
Pro-Israel PACs contributed $4.9 million and gave their
largest contributions to Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) who
received $297,786.
   PACs sponsored by labor unions gave more than $14 million
to senators. Their top beneficiary was Sen. Thomas Daschle
(D., S.D.), who received $510,999 from such PACs in the
six-year period.
   Under current law, Senate candidates may receive a
contribution of up to $5,000 from any PAC in a primary
election and the same amount in a general election. There is
no overall ceiling on the amount of money a candidate can
receive from various PACs.
   Proposals to limit the role played by PACS are among the
most contentious items in the highly partisan fight over
campaign-finance. With seven senators facing pending ethics
inquiries, the Senate is under intense pressure to reduce the
role of special-interest money in politics, but lawmakers are
split over how to do so.
   Historically, Democrats have enjoyed higher levels of PAC
support and have been less cordial to proposals to limit
them. However, a bill introduced last month by Sen. David
Boren (D., Okla.) would place an aggregate ceiling on the
amount of PAC money a Senate candidate can receive. President
Bush has proposed changes that would, in effect, abolish
corporate and labor PACs, while other Republicans advocate
lowering the contribution limits from $5,000 to $1,000.
   Steven Stockmeyer, who represents a coalition of business
PACs, opposes all such proposals. "PACS are as diverse as
America is," he says. "To artificially limit them limits that
diversity."
