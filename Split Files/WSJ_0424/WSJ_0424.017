   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. -- Amanda Solloway is a bit nervous as
she takes the "author's chair" in front of her class to read
a draft of "Ralph and Baseball," a story she has written
about a boy who conquers his fear of playing games on Friday
the 13th. When she finishes, a classmate questions her about
a detail in the story. Another makes a point about the plot.
A writing coach recommends some revisions.
   Amanda is in the third grade.

   Such elaborate analysis grew out of a determined effort in
Connecticut to zero in on where schools are failing and make
officials bring them up to snuff. Thanks to statewide tests,
school officials in this Hartford suburb found out four years
ago that their fourth and sixth graders were well below the
average in writing. Acting on this, they pushed a program
called "process writing," focusing on organization and
revision. At Metacomet Elementary School here, large signs on
the walls list the steps: pre-writing, drafting, revising,
editing and publishing.
   It seems to be helping. "In the past, you told kids to
write an essay, and either they could or they couldn't," says
Portia Mendez, Metacomet's principal. "Now they know how to
begin. If you tell them to write about their vacation, they
write the word `vacation' and then start putting down their
other thoughts -- television, playground, New York -- and
they can weave a story around them."
   The Connecticut plan has blazed a trail that educators and
politicians from President Bush down are now starting to
follow in a national effort to enhance education. The idea is
to set statewide goals and make school officials accountable
for results.
   The approach is somewhat unusual. In the U.S., education
has long been primarily a local responsibility. Although most
American students take a battery of standardized tests, there
isn't enough uniformity to give a coherent picture of where
schools are improving. And the U.S., unlike most other
industrial nations, has no national standards, no national
graduation tests and no national courses.
   Connecticut decided seven years ago to try standards on a
statewide basis. To begin, "We asked a very simple question:
What skills should we ask children to master?" explains
Gerald Tirozzi, the state's commissioner of education.
   Committees of teachers drafted grade-level achievement
goals. Then they devised tests to measure how well each
student, class, school and district was reaching the
objectives. The Connecticut Mastery Test was born. Now, every
October, all fourth, sixth and eighth graders in the state
take the test, which measures their competence in the Three
R's, reading, writing and arithmetic.
   The heart of it is a 45-minute writing exercise. An exam
for sixth graders last fall asked them to "pretend you could
live anywhere in the world. . . . Write a composition about
this place."
   Multiple-choice tests in math measure computational and
problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to interpret
data from graphs and charts. A reading test measures
comprehension and such higher-order skills as the ability to
draw inferences.
   Each December, school officials get detailed scores on
each child. Parents also get a report. In January,
school-district results "are published on the front page of
every newspaper in the state, and if a superintendent wants
to keep his job, he'd better make sure his schools do well,"
says Paul Copes, Bloomfield's superintendent of schools.
   The net result is to make school officials more
accountable for the progress of students than in the past.
Mr. Copes calls the tests "a public report card" that has
made it possible for voters and parents to see how Bloomfield
schools stack up against others in the state. Mary Eberle,
the chairwoman of Bloomfield's board of education, says that
in the early years, the tests were "instrumental in showing
the teachers that they weren't doing the job" and helping
teachers and administrators focus on ways to improve
teaching.
   Some educational critics complain that U.S. public schools
already inflict too many standardized tests on their
students, and that teachers, under pressure to show
improvement, "teach to the test." School officials here in
Bloomfield don't think so. "The mastery tests measure
life-long skills -- how to write, how to approach a problem,
how to estimate a solution," Mr. Copes contends. "You can't
do well on the test by rote memory."
   The concept of accountability is gaining support,
especially as other reforms fail to produce results. Over the
past decade, most states have focused their improvement
efforts on requirements, spending, resources, and tightening
graduation standards. Yet scores on standardized tests remain
low and employers complain that high-school graduates can't
read and reason well enough to be skilled workers.
   Here in Connecticut, Mr. Copes took over a district that
the state, through its testing, had just named one of the 20
weakest. In 1986, Bloomfield fell below the state average on
seven of the nine tests (three each for three grades).
   Last year, it was below the average on just three tests.
Like a Japanese factory, Bloomfield has lifted school
performance by responding to test results with relentless
attention to detail. "We have made adjustments in what we
teach and how we teach it," Mr. Copes says. "When I look at
the scores, I want to know if this is a system problem, a
school problem or a teacher problem. If it's a system
problem, it's probably the curriculum. If it's a school
problem, it may be leadership. If it's a classroom problem,
it may be an instructional" deficiency, he says.
   When performance on the sixth-grade writing test fell
sharply after three years of steady improvement, "upon review
we found some areas we could improve upon," the
superintendent continues. "The frequency of writing, the
monitoring of writing folders and the variety of writing
wasn't what we thought it should be." Hence the writing
program that has third graders elaborately analyzing one
another's writing.
   The attention Bloomfield teachers pay to writing is
unusual. In a recent nationwide survey, only 61% of 11th
graders said their teachers routinely mark mistakes on what
they write, while only 31% said their teachers commonly point
out what is well done. Possibly as a result, the survey found
that only 28% of 11th-graders could write an adequate letter
to a senator supporting a position on the space program.
   At Bloomfield, fine-tuning occurs in other subjects too.
"In math we developed a skill card for each grade level,"
says Mary Smith, assistant superintendent. "There are
required objectives that teachers have to cover every marking
period. It keeps a teacher from going over and over the same
topic for too long." The tests pinpoint students who need
extra help, which is required by the state for those who fall
below a certain level.
   Since the testing began, performance across Connecticut
has improved slowly but steadily. When the first group of
fourth graders took the tests in 1985, only 58.6% scored
above the remedial standard on all three tests: math,
language arts (which includes writing) and reading. Last
year, 65% scored above the remedial standard on all three
tests.
   Bloomfield has shown progress too. In 1985, when only
fourth graders took the tests, 39% of those in Bloomfield
needed remedial work in reading. By last fall, when these
children were in eighth grade, just 19% needed remedial work.
Math and writing have improved as well. "I'm looking to the
day when there are no remedial classes in the high school,"
Mr. Copes says.
   As a black superintendent in a district where 75% of the
students are black, he says he has another incentive: "The
challenge is to demonstrate that something largely minority
can be excellent."
   In its improvement drive, Bloomfield changed some of the
ways its schools operate. Elementary schools eliminated a
recess and reduced the number of times children move from one
room to another, such as the music room, thus adding 45
minutes a day to time available for teaching. Principals got
more authority over their teaching staffs and instruction
programs.
   Teachers now closely check homework performance, and
students who fall behind must complete their work during
special periods, sometimes on Saturday mornings. Mrs. Eberle,
the board of education chairwoman, says she learned that the
policy was having an impact when a student asked her to sign
a petition protesting longer homework assignments. (She
refused.) Parents of fourth graders and younger are asked to
read to their children 10 minutes a night.
   The schools monitor teacher performance more carefully and
hold more after-school meetings to discuss curriculum and
techniques. "The teachers have been required to do a
tremendous amount of extra work," says Raymond Froscio,
president of the local teachers' union, which is affiliated
with the National Education Association. Vaughn Ranseur, vice
principal in the high school, says that because of the
increased accountability, managers in the system face
"greater stress."
   But the unions and managers generally support the program.
One reason is that to compensate for the added effort,
Connecticut has lifted the average teacher salaries 41% since
1986, to $41,600 a year. The union's Mr. Froscio thinks it's
reasonable for school districts to expect greater
accountability as salaries rise.
   A growing number of educators see value in the concepts of
accountability and testing. "We have lots of tests, but we
really don't have any norms," notes Chester E. Finn Jr.,
chairman of the National Assessment Government Board, which
runs the federally funded National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP is the outfit that issues highly publicized
reports on how little students know). "Hence," he says, "we
have no clear sense of the result we seek from the efforts we
are making at school reform, or how good would be good
enough."
   Critics who question the value of standardized tests say
they raise the chances that national standards will be
imposed on local schools. Beverly Greenberg, a member of the
Connecticut board of education, worries that even the state
tests compromise local control, while overlooking important
differences. "I don't think every community is the same, and
I don't think every kid's needs are the same. I worry that
standardization will make everybody the same shade of gray,"
she says. But she concedes that the tests "have pushed
communities to improve basic skills.'
   Initially, some superintendents and school boards resisted
the larger state role, but the state board of education used
an open, public process in formulating achievement goals and
designing tests that made sense to the teachers. "Most of us
believe they are among the best tests in the country," says
Edward Reidy, the instructional director in the West Hartford
school system. Besides fourth, sixth and eighth graders, the
state is considering testing 10th graders.
   After establishing the mastery test system, Connecticut
also drafted a broad outline, called the Common Core of
Learning, of what it expects students to be able to do when
they complete high school. The standards are broad enough to
avoid being mistaken for a state curriculum.
   "We need a more common set of standards in this country,"
Mr. Reidy argues. "We don't want to lose local flavor or
control. But the fact is that our kids compete with kids from
all over the world, not just from Hartford."
