   Ratners Group PLC of Britain reported that for the year
ended Feb. 3, pretax profit surged 41% to #121 million
($198.4 million) from #86 million a year earlier, bolstered
by strong sales at most of the jewelry company's units, and
exceeding some market forecasts.
   Profit attributable to shareholders -- after taxes and
extraordinary items -- increased 46% to #79.1 million from
#54.2 million. The latest results included an extraordinary
gain of #94,000 from an office sale, less costs related to
termination of a business. The year-earlier period didn't
have any special items. Earnings per share rose 14% to 30.2
pence from 26.5 pence.
