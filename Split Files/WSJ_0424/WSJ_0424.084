   TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. posted a first-quarter loss of 13.3
million Canadian dollars (US$11.4 million), as revenue fell
13% because of the downturn in the auto industry, the strong
Canadian dollar and increased imports of steel into Canada.
   Separately, the steelmaker said Fred Telmer, president of
the company's Stelco Steel division, will succeed John D.
Allan as the company's chairman and chief executive officer
at the end of this year; Mr. Allan said previously that he
intended to retire this year.

   Stelco's per-share loss was 48 Canadian cents (41 U.S.
cents) in the latest period. A year ago, the company had net
income of C$32.7 million, or 83 Canadian cents a share. Sales
fell to C$638.9 million from C$737.5 million.
   The company said it plans a two-year cost-cutting program,
in which Stelco will shut several small plants, sell surplus
properties, reduce capital spending, and cut 800 jobs from
its 16,000-member work force.
   Stelco has spent heavily recently to build up inventory in
anticipation of a 90-day maintenance shutdown planned for one
of its blast furnaces in the year's third quarter.
   Mr. Telmer said the company won't have to go to the debt
or equity markets for additional financing this year.
   Mr. Telmer said Stelco will be able to meet liquidity
problems by selling about C$300 million of its C$900 million
in inventory by the end of 1991.
   Jay M. Gordon, an analyst with McLean McCarthy Ltd., said
it's unlikely the company will be able to sell the C$300
million. "If the markets are working as they are, {Stelco}
might find that it's going to take them a lot longer to sell
the steel," he said.
   Mr. Gordon said the company will have to seek out some
short-term funding to meet this year's obligations. Stelco,
which has bank credit lines of C$300 million, has said
previously that it might have to rely on the banks to get it
through its "temporary cash situation."
   In November, the company raised C$125 million through the
issue of debentures to help finance inventory costs.
   Analysts are concerned about the company's high debt level
and say Stelco will suffer from high interest payments this
year. Stelco said it currently has C$860 million in long-term
debt.
   Mr. Gordon said there's not much encouragement in the job
cuts either, which he said were expected. "There's probably
not a lot of fat left" on Stelco, he said. "I frankly don't
think they have that many people left to {cut}."
   Mr. Telmer said the company plans capital spending of
about C$200 million this year, little changed from last year.
He said most of the money will go to previously announced
projects, including C$100 million for the blast furnace work.
   Spending after 1990 will be cut to a maintenance level for
five years. "It will be tailored to just really keeping our
facilities current," Mr. Telmer said.
   Savings from the job reductions over the next two years
will amount to about C$43.2 million, with an additional C$50
million in savings from the sale of properties, the company
said.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Stelco Class A
fell 37.5 Canadian cents to C$17.50.
