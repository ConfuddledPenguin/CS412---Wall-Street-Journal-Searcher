   New World Hotels Ltd., which completed the acquisition of
Ramada Inc. four months ago, said it agreed to sell 17 of the
unit's U.S. hotels for $183 million.
   The Hong Kong hotel group, which is itself the focus of a
privatization bid by its parent, New World Development Co.,
is to sell 11 hotels to Wyndham Hotel Co., a Texas limited
partnership, for $116 million, in a transaction expected to
be completed May 21.

   Hospitality Unlimited Investments Co., of California, and
an unidentified individual have also agreed to buy six Ramada
Inns for $67 million. It may also purchase a further hotel in
Rosemont, Ill., for $35 million. The purchases are expected
to be completed by July 16.
   New World has long hinted at the sales as a way for it to
reduce debt associated with the $540 million Ramada purchase.
