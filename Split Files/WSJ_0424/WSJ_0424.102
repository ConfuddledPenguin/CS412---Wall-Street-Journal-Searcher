   WASHINGTON -- Peter Monroe, an official with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, is expected to
be named to a top position in the savings and loan bailout
operation, industry and administration sources said.
   Mr. Monroe, a deputy assistant HUD secretary for housing,
would serve as the president and chief executive officer of
the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp., a role
that was initially the subject of some dispute. The Oversight
Board sets policy for the RTC, which sells or liquidates
insolvent thrifts and their assets.

   Mr. Monroe would succeed William Taylor, a Federal Reserve
Board official who has served in the post on a temporary
basis since February. Mr. Taylor followed Daniel Kearney, a
former Salomon Brothers Inc. executive, who resigned in
February after just four months on the job. In resigning, Mr.
Kearney said unanticipated limitations had been placed on his
authority.
   Some in Congress have called for abolishing the Oversight
Board or streamlining the bailout operation in some way. The
board is perched at the top of the multilayered S&amp;L bailout
bureaucracy. It is made up of Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp.
   Mr. Monroe would head the board's staff of several dozen
people. After the earlier confusion, it seems certain that
the responsibilities of the post will be clarified before it
is filled.
   The RTC, which has a board that's separate from the
Oversight Board, carries out the sales of the thrifts, using
mostly personnel from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Mr. Monroe didn't return telephone calls yesterday, and a
HUD spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Monroe has met with
several administration officials who have a role in making
the selection. The Oversight Board held a closed-door meeting
yesterday on the post.
   Mr. Taylor, who is director of the Fed's division of
banking supervision and regulation, wasn't a candidate for
the post. Under his direction, however, the Oversight Board
made headway on setting sales policies, including sweetening
some terms to attract more bidders.
