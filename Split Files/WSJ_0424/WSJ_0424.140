   CalFed Inc. said improved core earnings pushed
first-quarter profit up 8% to $18.9 million, or 75 cents a
share, from $17.5 million, or 70 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   CalFed, whose principal unit is California Federal Bank,
attributed the improvement in the quarter to a 28% spurt in
net interest income in its financial services segment to
$128.5 million from $100.7 million.

   The Los Angeles company also said that the quarter
benefited modestly from a $1.3 million after-tax gain on the
sale of Anglo-American Insurance Co., CalFed's London-based
property-casualty insurance subsidiary. The Feb. 6 sale
marked the company's exit from the property-casualty
business.
   During the quarter, CalFed said its net interest margin --
the spread between the yields on loans and the cost of funds
-- improved to 2.24% from 1.47% a year ago.
   CalFed's California Federal unit, with $25.3 billion in
assets, currently exceeds all three capital requirements
under the thrift-rescue bill, CalFed said.
