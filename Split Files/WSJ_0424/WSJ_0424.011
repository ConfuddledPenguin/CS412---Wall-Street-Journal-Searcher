<TEXT>
   Endless waits in offices --
   The same in every town.
   It's no accident that "patient"
   Is both adjective and noun.
   The situation doesn't change --
   I guess it never will
   Until, for using up ourtime,
   We each submit a bill]

   Those prophets who can see far into civilization's future
have the gift of extra-century perception.
