   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Lone Star Industries Inc. said it sold
49% of its interest in a joint cement-manufacturing venture
to its partner, Centex Corp. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The manufacturer of cement and other construction

and related facilities at Salt Lake City to Centex, a
Dallas-based home builder and general contractor.
