   POUGHKEEPSIE SAVINGS BANK said it would omit its
second-quarter dividend. The Poughkeepsie thrift, citing a
troubled real estate investment portfolio, also reported a
first-quarter net loss of $7.8 million, or $2.21 a share.
Poughkeepsie Savings, which operates 11 branch offices in New
York's Hudson Valley, said net interest income for the first
quarter was $7.7 million, compared with $9.6 million a year
earlier. But latest-quarter results reflected an $8 million
increase in loan-loss reserves and a $2.9 million
stock-transaction loss. A year earlier, Poughkeepsie had a
profit of $1.9 million, or 53 cents a share. Poughkeepsie
said that the recently declared dividend of 15 cents a share
will be payable May 1. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Poughkeepsie stock fell 12.5 cents to $6.125.
