   NEW YORK -- Forget Madonna, Motley Crue, Janet Jackson and
the other current staples of Top 40 radio.
   The hottest format across the radio dial these days
showcases performers who haven't had hits in decades, such as
Dion and the Belmonts, Elvis Presley, The Supremes and Lesley
Gore.

   Since last year, the number of stations that program the
solid gold format has ballooned about 20%, making it one of
the fastest-growing formats, according to Broadcasting
magazine. "I've been following radio for about 20 years, and
I've never seen anything like this," says James Duncan Jr.,
publisher of American Radio, a quarterly analysis of radio
ratings, programming trends and financial data.
   By attracting baby boomers in the key 25-54 age group that
advertisers covet most, the oldies but goodies are turning
out to be pure gold for stations such as New York's
all-oldies WCBS-FM. "A lot of stations are looking for the
quick fix, and solid gold is it," says Joe McCoy, program
director at WCBS-FM, which switched from album-oriented rock
to oldies in 1972. "The aging of America is looking for
consistency and familiarity," he says.
   WCBS-FM, which has become steadily more popular since the
early 1970s, reached a milestone last week. For the first
time in its history as an oldies station, it finished as the
top-ranked radio station in New York in ratings compiled by
Arbitron Co., a unit of Control Data Corp. The station, owned
by CBS Inc., also finished No. 1 among 25-to-54-year-olds.
Mr. Duncan of American Radio predicts that WCBS-FM will be
the third-largest money-making station in the country, with
ad revenues of about $30 million. It trails only WGN-AM in
Chicago, with projected billings of $35 million, and KABC-AM
in Los Angeles, with $32 million.
   Even in markets where the oldies station has average or
below-average ratings overall, its popularity with affluent
listeners in the key demographic group is strong. For
example, in Boston, even though oldies station WODS-FM
finished a mediocre No. 11 in overall ratings, it scored its
fourth consecutive No. 1 victory in the 25-to-54 age group.
   "No question that the most attractive demographic likes to
listen to oldies," says Richard Cotter, vice president and
regional broadcast manager in the New York office of J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC. Mr. Cotter adds
that the age group also gravitates to adult contemporary
(Neil Diamond, Fleetwood Mac, Kenny Rogers) and all-news
outlets.
   The success of the oldies format is prompting a number of
stations with mediocre ratings in other formats to make the
switch. "Stations are searching for a format that would
attract the baby boomers, and in a lot of markets, the format
did not exist," says Gerry Boehme, vice president and
director of research at Katz Radio Group, a subsidiary of
Katz Communications Inc.
   Earlier this month, for example, Infinity Broadcasting
Corp. switched its lackluster adult contemporary station in
Detroit to oldies. "It's a big moneymaker, and you don't have
to depend on high-visibility morning shows," says Mel
Karmazin, president and chief executive officer of Infinity,
which also operates album-oriented rock and so-called classic
rock stations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and
Boston. "As an oldies station, you may not be everybody's No.
1 choice, but you are everyone's No. 2 choice," Mr. Karmazin
adds.
   Not everyone is thrilled about the oldies boom. Despite
the surge in music video as a marketing tool for new
recording artists, record companies still rely in part on
radio to move new material. "The record companies do not like
this format," says Nancy C. Widmann, president of the CBS
radio division, which owns 20 stations, including 12 FM
outlets, five with the oldies format. "We don't move their
product."
   An official at CBS Records, which is now a subsidiary of
Sony Corp., says that it would be in the best interests of
the record industry if each radio station would broadcast
both current and past hits. However, he acknowledges that may
be an unrealistic expectation, given the trend toward
identifiable formats.
   Some stations were initially wary of the oldies format,
which includes a heavy diet of The Beatles, The Rolling
Stones and other mainstays of the 1960s. Their executives
were concerned that people would naturally tire of songs they
were so familiar with. After all, how many times could you
hear The Dave Clark Five belt out "Over and Over"?
   "Some stations were afraid of the format because they
thought it would burn out," says Bill Clark, president of
Shamrock Broadcasting Co., which owns four oldies stations in
cities such as Denver and Atlanta. "But people identify with
an era of music and love to hear it again and again," he
says, adding that "for people who are 35 to 45 years old, the
oldies stations will be their equivalent of the big band
stations their parents listen to."
