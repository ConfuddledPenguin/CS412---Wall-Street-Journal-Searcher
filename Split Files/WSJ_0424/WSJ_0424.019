   MOMMY TRACKING doesn't have to hurt careers, a long-term
look suggests.
   Taking time off from a job to raise a family "doesn't
appear to have had a major impact on final earnings" of women
who graduated from college 45 years ago, says Edith Fierst, a
Washington lawyer who surveyed the experiences of classmates
from the Barnard College Class of 1945. "Those within a given
occupation tended to end up in the same bracket whether or
not they had taken time off for children," she declares.

   Of 75 class members who responded -- a third of the class
-- almost all had married and borne children, and most had
spent 10 to 15 years at home or in part-time jobs while their
families were young. Yet, Ms. Fierst says, of 11 graduates
earning more than $50,000 a year, seven had taken substantial
career breaks, as had most of those earning $25,000 to
$50,000 a year.
   Only 5% of the mommy trackers wished they had returned to
their careers earlier. One regretted a break.
                                                                                                       

   SUMMER INTERNSHIPS flourish, with emphasis on minorities.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., which started bringing students aboard
for a summer's exposure only three years ago, expects to hire
25 this year, up from seven in 1989. It taps minority M.B.A.
candidates, undergrads and talented high schoolers. Chevron
Corp.'s hiring will increase to 350 from 320, with most going
into engineering, computer science and accounting. Special
scholarships are set aside to lure minorities. Texaco Inc.,
among its interns, looks to hire four African students
attending U.S. universities.
   Corning Inc., which will be hiring 90 interns this summer,
focuses on women and blacks because they "have been leaving
the company twice as fast as white males." Aluminum Co. of
America seeks women and minorities with engineering and
technical training, explaining that women and minorities
"don't gravitate" to these disciplines and those that do
should get "the encouragement internships can provide."
                                                                                                       

   FIRING BAD WORKERS can drag on, managers say. Mercy or
fear of suits?
   Half the workers surveyed by consultant Wyatt Co.
complained that "poor performance is tolerated too long in my
company." Now managers say they agree. Observes Henry Nozko,
president of Acmat Corp.: that's "1,000%" on target. A
shortage of workers and fear of litigation make management
"more tolerant," he declares. Last year, he recalls, it took
three months to discharge a "boozing" worker who years back
"would have been fired on the spot."
   But Coastal Corp. argues that "letting someone go is easy;
turning someone around is more of a challenge." Managers tend
to give workers extra ground out of compassion and a
reluctance to get involved in a hostile confrontation, a
spokesman explains. Tasty Baking Co. says it follows a
four-step procedure before firing anyone, which it equates to
a "death penalty."
   "Managers are more sensitive to human issues, and that's
great," one retail executive asserts.
                                                                                                       

   STOCK OWNERSHIP revisited. A survey of 774 publicly traded
firms turns up only 9% that encourage managers to own the
company's stock and a bare 1% that require it, consultant
William M. Mercer Inc. finds.
                                                                                                       

   MIDDLE-MANAGER rebound? Fired managers took 3.1 months to
find a job in the first quarter, down from 3.3 months in
1989's final quarter, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas says.
                                                                                                       

   SECRETARIES AND CLERKS represented by unions earn $56 a
week more than their nonunion counterparts, says a study for
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
                                                                                                       

   MULTIEMPLOYER pension plans remain secure. Consultant
Martin E. Segal Co. says the plans had assets last year to
cover on average 96% of vested benefits. Three-quarters of
them were fully funded.
                                                                                                       

   BUT FOR THREE DAYS . . . A widow loses $100,000 in
benefits.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, reversing a lower
court, says Delvina Lorenzen is entitled to only $89,000 in
death benefits from Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., rather than the
$192,000 lump sum her husband, Warren, had elected to receive
had he lived until his retirement, in three more days. Or
retired five months earlier, at age 65, as he had been
planning until the company asked him to stay to complete a
project. Or if Mrs. Lorenzen hadn't agreed, three days short
of his retirement, to remove him from life-support equipment
after he suffered his second cardiac arrest in two weeks.
   "The equities are not all on one side, however," the court
held, adding, "they rarely are; the tension between formal
justice and substantive justice is often, and perhaps here,
illusory." Life-support equipment "should not be used to
secure retirement benefits," and the cost could have been
considerable, it stated. Moreover, by postponing his
retirement, Mr. Lorenzen continued to draw full salary and
slightly increased his expected retirement benefit.
   "A gamble is not unfair merely because the gambler loses,"
the appeals court said in a 3-to-1 decision.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Thin Line] Executives must work 53 hours a
week to win promotions but burn out at 62 hours a week,
members of the National Association of Executive Recruiters
say. . . . Thin Line II] Hiring executives contend they are
influenced by an applicant's appearance but aren't swayed by
an applicant's attractiveness, consultant Transition Team
finds.
