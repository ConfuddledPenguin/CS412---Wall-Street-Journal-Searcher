   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. reported a first-quarter net
loss of $51 million, or $3.25 a common share, after preferred
dividends, because of interest expense and the amortization
of the purchase cost related to Time's acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc.
   However, the company said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization were a record $536 million.
Time Warner, like other heavily leveraged media and cable
television companies, has been attempting to persuade Wall
Street to value it using that measure of its cash flow,
instead of on the more traditional earnings-based valuations.

   In the financial results released today, Time Warner
presented its 1989 figures on a historical and a pro forma
basis. Assuming the purchase of 100% of Warner as of Jan. 1,
1989, earnings for the quarter ended March 31 before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the
company's operating units increased 16% to $536 million from
$461 million a year earlier. Revenue climbed 7.9% to $2.74
billion from $2.54 billion.
   J. Richard Munro and Steven J. Ross, co-chairmen of Time
Warner, said in a statement that each of the company's
businesses "produced outstanding results, with five of our
six divisions setting new records."
   On a pro forma basis, magazine division earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first
quarter dropped to $54 million from $70 million in the 1989
period. Time Warner said that, as expected, the start-up
costs of Entertainment Weekly hurt magazine results. A softer
advertising environment, primarily in automotive and tobacco,
was responsible for a decline in advertising revenue, while
circulation revenue rose modestly, the company said.
   Also on a pro forma basis, first-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from Time
Warner's filmed entertainment division was a record $92
million, up 35% from its previous high of $68 million posted
last year. Led by "Driving Miss Daisy," which won four
Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress,
Warner Bros.' domestic theatrical revenues were especially
strong. "Driving Miss Daisy" has to date topped the $93
million mark at the box office. First-quarter results were
also boosted by strong revenues in foreign theatrical
distribution and record world-wide home video sales.
   In the recorded-music and music-publishing division,
meanwhile, pro forma earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 12% to a record $149
million on strong international sales. World-wide
compact-disk sales volume grew 24% in the quarter.
   The cable-television division's first-quarter pro forma
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 29% to a record $179 million. The
programming division, which includes Home Box Office, was
almost flat for the quarter, with earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $45 million. Included
in the 1990 results are start-up expenses associated with The
Comedy Channel, which may be merged with rival Viacom Inc.'s
Ha] Channel if current talks between the two companies reach
fruition.
   The books division's pro forma earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization more than doubled to $17
million from $7 million a year earlier.
