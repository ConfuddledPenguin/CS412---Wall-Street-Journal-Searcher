   HARTFORD, Conn. -- In the wake of the company's report
that first-quarter profit rose nearly 9%, United Technologies
Corp. Chairman Robert F. Daniell said he's confident the
earnings growth will continue.
   Addressing the company's annual meeting, Mr. Daniell
attributed the growth to corporatewide, cost-cutting efforts
that "will bear fruit for years to come." He cited the Pratt
&amp; Whitney jet engine division's plan to trim costs as much as
30% by 1992 as "emblematic of these efforts."

   Earnings climbed to $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share, from
$123.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
increased to $4.8 billion from $4.46 billion.
   Mr. Daniell said a three-year working capital reduction
program, which is in place, is expected to save $1 billion by
1991. "In 1989, the first year of the program, we reduced the
absolute level of working capital tied up in our businesses
by about $350 million, even as revenue rose 7%," he said.
"New opportunities for us on the commercial side in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union can more than make up for any
slack caused by reductions in the defense budget."
   He said the company will continue to invest in research
and development. It has done a better job of transferring and
applying aerospace and defense technology to its commercial
and industrial businesses, Mr. Daniell said. The company's
businesses include building systems, automotive products and
aerospace.
