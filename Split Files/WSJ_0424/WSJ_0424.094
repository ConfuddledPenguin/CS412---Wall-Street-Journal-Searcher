   MIAMI -- Ryder System Inc. reported that first-quarter net
income fell 72% to $7.3 million, or seven cents a share, in
another dismal quarter for the struggling
transportation-services company.
   M. Anthony Burns, chairman and chief executive, said the
company, continued to be hurt by among other things,
sluggishness in commercial truck rentals. A year earlier
Ryder earned $26.2 million, or 31 cents a share. Revenue rose
slightly to $1.25 billion from $1.22 billion a year earlier.

   The latest results were in line with analysts' forecasts
for the company. As expected, the automotive carrier
division, crippled by the worst U.S. automobile industry
slump in a decade, reported a loss of $2.3 million, compared
with net income of $9.4 million a year earlier.
   On the aviation services side, gains in Ryder's aircraft
engine overhaul and new-parts distribution businesses were
offset by continued softness in leasing of used aircraft, and
sales of reusable aircraft parts.
   There were some bright spots, however. The company said
revenue increased in its huge Vehicle Leasing and Services
division. In addition, the company said that consumer truck
rental prices are finally stabilizing after last year's
lengthy price war with competitor U-Haul International Inc.
   This led Mr. Burns to express confidence in Ryder's
performance over the remainder of 1990. "When you look behind
the numbers, it is clear that, while demand is still soft,
the work we have been doing is bending the trends in the
right direction," he said. "We believe the March results
indicate that our comparisons will be more favorable in the
second and third quarters."
