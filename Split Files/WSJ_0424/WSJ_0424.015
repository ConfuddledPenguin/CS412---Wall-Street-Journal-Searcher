   SEOUL -- South Korea posted a trade deficit of $1.9
billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a
surplus of $58 million a year earlier.
   The Office of Customs Administration said exports fell
1.1% to $13.93 billion from $14.06 billion, while imports
surged 13% to $15.84 billion from $14.09 billion.

   Analysts blame the drop in exports on the rising value of
the won against the Japanese yen. The yen's value against the
won has fallen by about 20% since the beginning of 1989.
