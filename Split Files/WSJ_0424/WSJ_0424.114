   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said John Antioco, one of its
top operations and marketing executives, is leaving the
company to become chief operating officer of Pearle Inc., a
chain of optical stores.
   Mr. Antioco, 40 years old, who has spent his career at the
convenience-stores concern, became one of four Southland
senior vice presidents in 1989. He was in charge of
Southland's 7-Eleven store operations, overseeing marketing,
operations and gasoline sales at the company's 7,000 outlets.
Prior to that, he was the company's vice president,
marketing.

   At Dallas-based Pearle, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC
of London, he will oversee the operations of 1,250 retail
eyewear stores operating under the names Pearle Vision
Centers and Pearle Vision Express.
   Both Southland and Pearle said Mr. Antioco's move isn't
related to Southland's trouble in paying its debt from its
1987 leveraged buy-out or Southland's recent agreement to
sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese partners.
   "We've been courting him for some time," said Howard
Stanworth, Pearle chairman and chief executive officer.
