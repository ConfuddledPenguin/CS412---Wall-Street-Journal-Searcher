   Lancaster Colony Corp., a consumer goods concern based in
Columbus, Ohio, said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, in
which holders will receive, as a dividend, one right for each
share of stock held at the close of business tomorrow.
   Under the plan, the rights may be exercised if an investor
acquires, without board approval, at least 15% of the
corporation's common stock or announces a tender offer that
would result in the investor's owning at least 30% of the
common. If the rights are exercised, holders will be able to
buy the company's common stock having a market value of $140
for $70. Such plans are designed to make unwanted takeover
bids prohibitively expensive.
