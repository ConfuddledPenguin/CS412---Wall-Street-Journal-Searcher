   Although New York is America's leading art market, its
art-recovery law has not been a shining exemplar of Yankee
plain-spokenness. Indeed, New York has no statute expressly
for the recovery of stolen art, only an idiosyncratic muddle
of case law. Clarity, however, may be just around the corner.
The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, now has an
opportunity to define the law, in a ruling expected after
Labor Day.
   Just last year, a New York Supreme Court judge (the
state's lowest judicial level) rebuffed the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, saying it could not sue to recover a
Chagall gouache from Mrs. Jules Lubell because, since the
work's disappearance in the mid-1960s, the museum had taken
no action to report or recover it. But the Guggenheim is
back, having taken its case to the Appellate Division, whose
five judges decided unanimously in late January that the
museum's inaction should not prohibit it from bringing suit.
The Appellate Division's opinion said such cases should be
determined neither by statutes of limitations nor by tests of
due diligence, but rather by a court deciding whether both
parties had behaved reasonably at the time. Mrs. Lubell then
asked to have the Court of Appeals rule on the question, and
on March 29, despite the unanimity of the intermediate court,
it was decided that the highest court would do so.

   Litigation to recover stolen art is not rare. Right now in
New York, the Republic of Turkey is waiting to hear if its
suit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, claiming
ownership of the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 works of ancient
silver, will be heard. The Netherlands is suing New York
developer and art collector Ian Woodner to get a Hans Baldung
Grien drawing it contends was in a collection stolen by the
Nazis.
   Earlier this year, Lebanon and Yugoslavia each asked a New
York court to freeze Sotheby's proposed sale of the Sevso
Treasure, a magnificent group of late Roman silver reportedly
purchased by the Marquess of Northampton in Switzerland in
the 1970s. The treasure is said to have an export license
from Lebanon, but Yugoslavia's papers assert that the
treasure was excavated in the early '70s near Pula in the
Yugoslavian province of Istria, where the Sevso family was
prominent, that its export was illegal, and that Yugoslavian
title to the silver is superior to any other.
   The New York Court of Appeals ruling will affect not only
the suits currently under consideration, but the behavior of
people in the art market. Every day, situations crop up in
which people require legal counsel, as they contemplate
acquiring works without provenance or decide whether or not
to return works of art requested by original owners.
   A Connecticut man came in to IFAR to inquire whether a
17th-century English clock he'd bought at an antique shop in
Valhalla, N.Y., had been stolen; we informed him that a
Manhattan dealer had reported the theft of one that appeared
to be identical in 1977. The clock now is worth upward of
$200,000, and attorneys for the two parties are negotiating.
   A private art dealer recently called IFAR's Art Theft
Archive to see if the beautiful Chagall oil painting he was
being offered was hot. He didn't know the sellers, and the
price was too low, he believed; "I'm not that lucky," he told
us. He wasn't. The painting had been stolen in Baltimore in
1970. Its current value is more than $1 million. Lawyers have
arranged the return.
   Civil suits are much more common than criminal actions in
cases of art theft. But April 30 is the trial date for
Madison Avenue art dealer Michael Weisbrod, who is accused of
buying two Chinese porcelains and an 18th-century pink coral
carving knowing they were stolen.
   The thieves had robbed museums in Detroit, Columbus, Ohio,
Albany, N.Y., Syracuse, N.Y., Boston and Baltimore of
decorative-arts items including a silver Tiffany pitcher; a
ceramic masterpiece of 1910, Adelaide Alsop Robineau's
"Scarab Vase"; the Chinese porcelains; and a group of English
antique pocket watches. They were caught after an attempt to
sell the watches. Mr. Weisbrod's attorney, Richard Berne,
told IFAR that he and his client are "confident that he will
be exonerated."
