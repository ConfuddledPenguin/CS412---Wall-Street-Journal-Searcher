   TOKYO -- Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in
March declined 2.8% from a year earlier to 1,234,000 units,
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
   Despite the fall in March, the overall output of vehicles
produced in Japan during the year ended March 31 reached
12,954,000 units, up 1.0% from a year earlier to a record
level. The previous record of 12,819,000 units was set in the
prior fiscal year.

   In March alone, sluggish truck and bus output hindered
overall production growth, while car production posted a
steady 9.4% year-on-year rise.
