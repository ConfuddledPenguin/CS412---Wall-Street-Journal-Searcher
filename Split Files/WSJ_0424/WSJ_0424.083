   SEATTLE -- Plum Creek Timber Co. L.P. said a brisk price
rise for raw logs pushed first-quarter net income up to about
80 cents a share, from 75 cents in the year-earlier period.
   The forest products limited partnership expects to report
that revenue grew about 17% to $90 million from $77 million a
year earlier.

   The company said 1990 first-quarter profit was damped by
depreciation costs, amounting to about 40 cents a share,
related to its spinoff from Burlington Resources Inc. last
June. Minus those costs, Plum Creek's first-quarter profit
would have improved about 30%, said Rick R. Holley, the
company's chief financial officer.
   Burlington Resources, a Seattle-based energy and natural
resources concern, still holds about 1.25 million, or 8%, of
Plum Creek's 15.6 million publicly traded partnership units.
   David D. Leland, Plum Creek Timber's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview that market forces
which pushed up the company's first-quarter profit should
also position the company favorably in coming quarters. Mr.
Leland said prices for both exported and domestic logs were
up 30% from the year-earlier quarter, largely owing to a
diminished supply of harvestable timber from the Pacific
Northwest's federal forests.
   The harvest and sale of raw logs amount to about 40% of
Plum Creek's revenue; the company, moreover, is the
second-largest private timberland owner in the Pacific
Northwest, with holdings of about 1.4 million acres. Thus it
has been able to harvest a steady source of timber at a time
when prices continue to increase -- a trend that Leland sees
continuing.
