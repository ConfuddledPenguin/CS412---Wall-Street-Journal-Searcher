   A STORY in the April 5 edition reported that W.R. Grace &amp;
Co. had been found negligent in a chemical-dumping case and
had then settled out of court. The settlement, however, was
reached only after the judge had vacated the negligence
verdict and ordered a new trial.

   KEMPER CORP. expects to report that its securities
operations had a "substantially smaller" loss in the first
quarter of 1990 than the operations incurred in the fourth
quarter of 1989. In yesterday's edition, the comparison was
misstated.
