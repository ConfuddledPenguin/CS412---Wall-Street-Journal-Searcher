   Avon Products Inc. reported that first-quarter profit more
than doubled to $15.2 million from a year earlier, aided by
cost-cutting and lower interest expenses.
   The cosmetics concern's net income rose to $15.2 million,
or 11 cents a share, from $6.2 million a year earlier, which
resulted in a net loss of five cents a share after the
preferred dividend requirement.

   First-quarter sales fell slightly to $703.8 million from
$704.9 million a year earlier. Avon said its retail fragrance
sales fell 44% reflecting the sale of Parfums Stern, the
fragrance division that Avon sold last January. Excluding
Parfums Stern, Avon's sales for the quarter rose 4% from a
year earlier.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Avon
shares closed yesterday at $35.375, down 50 cents.
   Avon said that its interest expense fell 13% in the first
quarter from a year earlier. The company added that it is
progressing on reducing its debt, which at the end of the
first quarter was $695.9 million, compared with $1.13 billion
a year earlier.
