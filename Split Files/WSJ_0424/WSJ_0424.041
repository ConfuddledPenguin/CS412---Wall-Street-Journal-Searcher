   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission foresees a
struggle that could extend into 1991 in getting the 12 member
states to agree to EC-wide capital-adequacy rules for
securities firms, and is expected to unveil proposed rules
tomorrow.
   After consulting with the securities industry and much
compromising, the commission hopes the proposals will be
acceptable to West Germany and Britain, where the securities
markets' main players are specialized firms. In West Germany,
by contrast, universal banks combine banking, insurance,
securities trading and other financial services. The problem
is finding rules flexible enough to be fair to all. The
commission has revised its plans to meet many concerns of
British firms, which said the EC rules were too onerous, but
many smaller firms fear minimum-capital rules will drive them
out of business.

   The capital-adequacy rules are linked to a proposed EC
directive to let securities firms operate on an EC-wide
basis, as long as they are licensed to do business in one
member state. But West German banks fear this will allow
British firms to undercut the fees charged in West Germany,
because non-German firms won't be subject to the more onerous
capital requirements for banks. The commission proposal would
let banks' securities units fall under the same rules as
securities firms elsewhere in the EC. But West German banks
would still be subject to strict West German rules on
capital, and are expected to push for tougher overall rules
or protection from foreign competition.
