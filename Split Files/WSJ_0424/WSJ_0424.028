   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it expects to close a
Michigan assembly plant in 1993, the latest in a string of
closures designed to bring the auto maker's production
capacity in line with its sales.
   Production of the compact pickup trucks now built at the
plant will be moved to a plant in New Jersey that now builds
compact cars. So GM is reducing its car-making capacity,
which it has in excess, but keeping the same number of
truck-assembly plants, where its capacity roughly equals
demand.

   The latest announcement of a plant closing comes just as
GM heads into contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
Union officials, already angry over earlier plant shutdowns,
have promised to make job security a top issue in
negotiations this summer. "It's hard to see how greater
efficiency and higher worker morale can result from GM's
continuing game of musical chairs with the lives of our
members and their families," said Stephen P. Yokich, who
heads the UAW's General Motors department.
   Since 1988, GM has closed three car-assembly plants, and
it plans to idle another one later this year. In addition,
the No. 1 auto maker now has converted or plans to convert
three car plants into truck plants. Even after GM cranks up
production at its new Saturn car plant, the net reduction in
car capacity will be equivalent to six plants. Clearly, GM is
pushing to keep its often-stated promise to be using 100% of
its North American vehicle-building capacity by 1992.
   The loser in yesterday's move was GM's Pontiac West
assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., which expects to "cease
production" of compact pickup trucks at the end of 1993. The
plant employs 2,000 hourly workers.
   GM's plant in Linden, N.J., will stop building Chevrolet
Corsica and Beretta cars in September 1991 and then retool
for compact pickup trucks. The Linden plant will begin
building trucks in the fall of 1992, a GM spokeswoman said.
Linden currently employs 1,800 hourly workers on just one
shift because of sluggish sales of the cars it builds. The
plant should employ about 2,600 after it switches over to
trucks, said Charlie L. Marshall, president of the UAW local
that represents the Linden plant.
   "With this announcement came a lot of relief for a lot of
people" at the Linden plant, Mr. Marshall said.
   Linden was chosen to build compact trucks because it is a
larger, more flexible plant than Pontiac West, a GM
spokeswoman said. Linden has 2.5 million square feet of
enclosed space, compared with 1.8 million in Pontiac West.
Also, GM spent $130 million in 1987 to install at Linden a
modern "clear-coat" paint shop, which Pontiac West lacks.
   The Pontiac West plant is represented by a militant union
local, headed by members of the New Directions movement that
opposes close cooperation with management. "We're not into
the team concept," said Ron Miller, vice president of UAW
Local 594.
   A GM spokeswoman replied, "We look at a number of things;
labor relations would be one of them." But she added, "It
would be difficult to separate one issue out and say the
decision was made on one thing."
   Mr. Miller predicted that GM would pick Pontiac West to
assemble another model after it stops building compact pickup
trucks there in 1993. But the GM spokeswoman said the car
maker currently has "no other product" planned for Pontiac
West.
   In connection with the changes at Linden and Pontiac, GM
said, it is developing the flexibility at its two assembly
plants in Lansing, Mich., to build either the Beretta or
Corsica. Those plants currently build three other compact
cars, the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and
the Buick Skylark.
   All five models, though, are about the same size, and are
expected to be consolidated in the early-to-mid 1990s as part
of GM's continuing cost-reduction effort. "This fits into our
overall strategy at the Lansing Automotive Division of being
able to produce all of these small cars and use (common)
components within them," the company spokeswoman said.
