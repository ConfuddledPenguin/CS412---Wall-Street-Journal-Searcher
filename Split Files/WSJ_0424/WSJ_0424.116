   WASHINGTON -- A group of disabled people has joined forces
with home builders to oppose proposed federal guidelines that
would make apartment buildings more accessible to the
handicapped.
   The National Coordinating Council on Spinal Cord Injury
and the National Association of Home Builders complained that
the guidelines, which were written by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and are still being reviewed by
the White House, are "impractical, inflexible and too
costly."

   But there is division among the disabled. Bonnie Milstein,
co-head of the housing task force of the Consortium of
Citizens with Disabilities, said, "Most groups that represent
people who use {wheel}chairs support HUD's guidelines."
   Jack Powell, president of the spinal injury council and
executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said
he opposes the guidelines because they would make housing too
expensive, thus denying accessibility through high cost.
   "Affordability is a central part of the accessibility
equation," Mr. Powell said in a statement released yesterday.
"Persons with disabilities -- like most other people -- have
limited budgets to meet their housing expenses. If HUD's
design guidelines result in significant increases in the cost
of housing, then we have really defeated the purpose of the
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and created another
barrier to accessibility."
   The guidelines were prepared to carry out the 1988
legislation, which prohibited housing discrimination against
the disabled. New multifamily buildings with four or more
units and occupied after March 13, 1991, would be covered.
   Gordon Mansfield, HUD's assistant secretary for fair
housing and equal opportunity, said the opponents of the
guidelines base their opposition on "misunderstandings on
their part as to what we're doing."
   Mr. Powell estimated the HUD proposals would add $1,300 to
$3,700 to the cost of each walk-up unit and $3,200 to $4,250
to the cost of each mid-rise to high-rise unit. "During the
congressional debate in 1988, it was estimated by leaders in
the House and Senate that the costs for complying with this
legislation would run less than $500 per unit," Mr. Powell
said.
   Mr. Mansfield, a former official of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, said the cost complaint is a "red herring." An
analysis of the HUD guidelines indicates they would add 1% to
the cost of housing, he said. "That is not an undue burden to
the building industry or people with disabilities," he added.
   The home builders and the spinal cord council have their
own set of guidelines that they say would be less expensive,
while in some cases providing greater accessibility than
HUD's. HUD's guidelines would require every bathroom in a
unit to be larger than currently required, but not
necessarily fully accessible to wheelchairs.
   The protesting groups say at least one bathroom should be
fully accessible, but each one doesn't have to be as large as
HUD wants. "The issue here is whether you need the extra
maneuvering space in the second bathroom or powder room,"
said Thomas D. Davies Jr., an architect for the Paralyzed
Veterans of America.
