   Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., and F. Hoffmann-La Roche
Ltd. said they reached an agreement to market interleukin-2
products in Europe.
   The Roche Holding Inc. unit and EuroCetus B.V., Cetus's
European subsidiary, will each market both Proleukin and
Roferon-A in Switzerland and in all European Community member
countries except Denmark and Greece.

   Each company will pay a commission to the other on sales
of its proprietary product. Proleukin is approved for
marketing in most of Europe for the treatment of advanced
kidney cancer. Roferon-A is approved for the treatment of
various cancer and viral diseases. The western European
anti-cancer market is estimated to be $700 million, the
companies said.
   The companies agreed to collaborate on the clinical
development of interleukin-2 products for other potential
cancer and non-cancer uses. Roche will make an initial
payment to Cetus and share in expenses for the development of
these additional therapeutic indications.
   In addition, the companies said they agreed to collaborate
on the development of Proleukin and Roferon-A as a combined
treatment for cancer and other diseases, with Roche bearing
the costs.
