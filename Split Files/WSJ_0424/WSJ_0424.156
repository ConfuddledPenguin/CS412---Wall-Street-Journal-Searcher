   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Digital Microwave Corp. stock plunged
almost 50% yesterday on news that fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings fell below estimates because of company errors in
manufacturing and selling a new product.
   The company wasn't more specific about the impact on
earnings, but it did say that it believes that earnings for
the quarter ended March 31 were "substantially lower" than
the 28 cents a share reported in fiscal 1989's fourth
quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Digital had net income of
$3.4 million on revenue of $20.4 million.

   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Digital shares were
battered, closing at $14.125, off $13.875 from Friday's close
of $28. Volume topped 2.4 million shares.
   The communications product manufacturer said it suffered a
host of problems related to the introduction of its
state-of-the-art microwave radio used by telephone concerns
and other communications companies. The company said the
price of the radio varies depending on its configuration but
that it typically sells for $30,000.
   William E. Gibson, Digital's president and chief executive
officer, said problems included accelerated costs when the
company moved from pilot manufacturing to mass manufacturing
of the radios. In addition, he said that the radio was
underpriced and added that the company is now studying how
much of an increase it should tack on to current prices.
   Prior to the company's announcement, Wall Street had
expected that Digital would earn between 40 cents and 44
cents a share for the fourth quarter. But yesterday, Steven
B. Levy, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, told the Dow Jones
News Service that he expects Digital's earnings were only 16
cents to 17 cents a share.
