   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Meredith Corp. said net income rose
2.1% in the third quarter ended March 31 to $4.8 million, or
26 cents a share, from $4.7 million, or 25 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Excluding earnings from the Meredith/Burda commercial
printing operations, which the company has agreed to sell to
Donnelly &amp; Sons Co., profit fell 33% to $2 million, or 11
cents a share, from $2.9 million, or 16 cents a share.

   The company cited lower profit margins in its
book-publishing business and soft revenue at its television
stations for the decline. Meredith said it expects the sale
of Meredith/Burda to be completed in the fourth quarter.
   Revenue rose 1.2% to $199.1 million from $196.7 million.
   Profits from Meredith's magazines, which include Ladies'
Home Journal, Better Homes and Gardens and other
publications, were "significantly higher" than a year ago,
the company said.
   Book-publishing operations, however, were hurt by
increased manufacturing costs and other expenses.
   For the first nine months, net fell 9% to $23.5 million,
or $1.27 a share, from $25.7 million, or $1.35 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $606.7 million from $583.1
million.
