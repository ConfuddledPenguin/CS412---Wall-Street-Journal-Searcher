   The weekend release of American hostage Robert Polhill
after long captivity in Lebanon shows us something important:
Holding firm against terrorism works. Just last week,
President Bush was facing strong criticism for refusing to
send an envoy to Damascus at the demand of Mr. Polhill's
captors to negotiate the terms of Mr. Polhill's release. But
Mr. Bush chose not to accede to such demands -- and Mr.
Polhill went free all the same.
   The hope is that this lesson will not be forgotten by the
Bush administration. It is a lesson that bears on a
long-standing problem: The release of this American hostage
occurred nearly 10 years to the day after President Carter's
mission to save American hostages in Iran failed.

   Three U.S. administrations have been manipulated by
hostage-takers. That terrorists, released hostages and the
family members of hostages will work together to pressure the
U.S. government to meet terrorist demands is understandable.
What is not understandable is how the media and successive
American governments have succumbed to the belief that a
"goodwill" gesture by the U.S. toward the hostage-takers is
necessary.
   Let's take a moment to review how terrorism really works.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah and its front groups have been
responsible for the kidnapping of at least 51 foreigners in
Lebanon from 1983 to the end of 1989. According to the latest
intelligence figures, 13 of those hostages died in captivity,
as a result of poor medical care, maltreatment or outright
torture. But uncritical reporting has helped to create the
powerful illusion that the hostages have been killed in
response to the failure of the U.S., Israel or European
nations to meet the demands of the hostage-takers.
   In general, the bark of terrorists holding hostages in
Lebanon has been much worse than their bite. During the past
four years, Lebanese hostage-takers have issued more than 80
threats to kill hostages. Yet, each deadline named by the
terrorists has passed without incident.
   In one study, released in 1989, authors at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies reported
that:
   "Whatever the intent of the terrorists, no direct
connection has been established between the threats and the
death of hostages. Not only have most of the threats not been
carried out, but the few deaths that have occurred served
essentially as retaliation for specific developments or
resulted from deterioration in conditions of captivity and
the state of the health of the hostages."
   The report added that "hostages died of sickness or
torture or were shot trying to escape. Yet their deaths were
later presented by Hezbollah as `executions' and therefore
served the organization's propaganda purposes."
   Let's examine several cases. Islamic Jihad declared in
March 1986 that it had executed French scholar Michel Seurat
in "retaliation for the expulsion of 13 Moslems from France,
including two opponents of the Iraqi regime." A photo of
Seurat was sent to the Beirut news agencies. In fact,
intelligence sources say Seurat died of liver failure --
specifically, hepatitis brought on by unsanitary conditions
and lack of medical attention. Dennis Hill, a British
citizen, was shot to death while attempting to escape two
days after he was kidnapped in May 1985.
   American Peter Kilburn's body was found in April 1986,
immediately after the U.S. bombing of Libya. But there had
been no ultimatum issued by his captors or killers. Kilburn
had been "purchased" from Hezbollah by Libyan agents and
executed by them.
   Islamic Jihad sought to exploit its capture of Central
Intelligence Agency Beirut station chief William Buckley by
issuing a series of threats to kill him in the 13 months
following his kidnapping in 1984. The threats stated that
unless the government of Kuwait released the Al-Dawa 17 --
Shiite terrorists arrested for a series of lethal bombings in
Kuwait -- or, if Kuwait carried out the death sentences that
had been imposed on three of the Al-Dawa 17, then Islamic
Jihad would kill Buckley. In June 1985 the Iranians told
American and Israeli intermediaries that Buckley was still
alive and that his release could be arranged through barter.
   In fact, Buckley almost certainly died in May 1985. He was
either executed outright or died from wounds suffered in
torture inflicted by his captors. His body has never been
recovered. In any case, his killing is virtually certain to
have occurred in the course of a brutal interrogation. The
existence of a 400-page transcript of his "confession" was
frequently mentioned throughout the Iran-Contra affair. But
the purported transcript has never been retrieved and it is
now believed by some American intelligence officials that the
Iranians fabricated the document to enhance their leverage
over the U.S.
   The Iran-Contra affair itself demonstrated the futility of
surrendering to the demands of hostage-takers. To induce the
Iranians to release three American hostages, the U.S. sold
them missiles and performed other acts of capitulation. The
hostages were released -- and three more were taken captive
soon afterward.
   Last summer, President Bush faced his first challenge from
Hezbollah. Israel had kidnapped terrorist commander Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid from south Lebanon on July 28 and then
offered to trade the sheikh for two Israeli soldiers and for
the American hostages held by Hezbollah. Within 36 hours of
the abduction of Sheik Obeid, a typewritten threat was handed
to news agencies in Beirut that said that Lt. Col. William
Higgins would be hanged unless Israel released the sheik.
   The first White House reaction to the threat to kill
Higgins was a blunt refusal to be blackmailed. But the
administration's tough stance soon crumbled. Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole, in remarks that White House and State
Department officials now say were cleared in advance, accused
Israel of "endangering American lives." Mr. Bush himself
echoed Sen. Dole's comments, criticizing the capture of Sheik
Obeid. The president effectively equated the kidnapping of
the sheik with Hezbollah's abduction of Higgins and other
Americans.
   Then, on July 31, Hezbollah announced to the world that it
had hanged Higgins. The organization distributed a grisly
videotape that showed the colonel twisting at the end of a
rope. Several days later, however, American intelligence
firmly concluded that Higgins had actually been executed some
six months earlier by his captors. The tape had been released
in an effort to create the false impression that Higgins had
died because of America's and Israel's failure to heed
Hezbollah's demands.
   At the same time, Hezbollah continued the game. It
threatened to kill a second American hostage, Joseph
Cicippio. This time the U.S. tack was the right one. The
White House ordered a review of the military options
available against Hezbollah, including raids against the
organization's bases in Lebanon by American bombers and
bombardment by U.S. battleships in the Mediterranean. The
White House issued a stern warning to Hezbollah unambiguously
indicating that it would take military action if the
terrorists killed Mr. Cicippio. Deterred, Hezbollah
repeatedly extended its "deadline" for the execution of Mr.
Cicippio -- and then finally dropped the threat altogether.
   But, within six weeks of the release of the video showing
Higgins' death, the administration saw fit to reward Iran. In
September, the administration did nothing to impede an
out-of-court settlement of a 10-year-old lawsuit between
Ashland Oil and the National Iranian Oil Co. that called for
Ashland to pay Iran $325 million. Weeks later, the U.S.
agreed to allow $567 million held in escrow in an English
bank account to be transferred to the Iranian government. The
reason given was that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal would
otherwise have forced the administration to free up these
funds. But U.S. officials have admitted that there were at
least two years worth of stalling techniques left to the U.S.
-- had it wanted to take a firm line against Iran. The
release of funds to Iran amounted to a decision to let
terrorists get away with killing an American.
   The president's refusal to cave in to the hostage-takers'
demands that he send a top American official to Damascus, and
his pointed refusal to reward Iran for Mr. Polhill's release,
are good signs. But it would be wrong -- and a betrayal of
the 600 Americans who have died since 1983 in
Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks, like the Lockerbie and
Marine barracks bombings -- to "forgive" Iran or Hezbollah
even if all the remaining hostages are released. For the
moment, though, the U.S. government seems to be headed in the
right direction.
