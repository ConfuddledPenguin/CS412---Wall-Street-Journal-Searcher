   I had never thought to cry "Et tu, Brute]" to the
editorial writers of the Journal. Your arguments, whether or
not one agrees with them, are generally cogent, and at times
elegantly expressed. Always, in my memory, they have been
models of diction.
   Yet on March 20 you told us that Congress continues to
"flaunt" (a word meaning "to display ostentatiously") the
revised minimum-wage law. You meant "flout" ("to mock or
insult; to treat with contempt"). No Caesar I, but you have
plunged a dagger deep into the heart of this old lover of the
English language.

   Your message is well worth an editorial, if not a
front-page article, but the first sentence probably confused
many readers. "Flaunt" generally means to show off
ostentatiously, as in "flaunting his superiority." Instead,
Congress is flouting the minimum-wage law, treating it with
scornful disregard. While "flaunt" does carry this as a
secondary meaning, its use in this context was confusing,
since Congress often trumpets its newest legislation.

   Tsk. To flout flout you flaunt flaunt.
   Instead, you should flaunt flout and so flout flaunt.

   You say Congress is going to "flaunt a major piece of
recently enacted federal legislation." No doubt this is the
result of a misquotation on congressional defiance of
minimum-wage legislation. No member of Congress said, "I
flaunt to be alone." There was, however a clear chorus of
"Flout, flout, damned spot]"
   This modest adjustment to reality is offered in a spirit
of constructive good will and is not intended to flout
erudition or flaunt convention.
