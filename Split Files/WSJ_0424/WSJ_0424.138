   NEW YORK -- City police arrested 204 demonstrators, mostly
for disorderly conduct, as environmental activists attempted
to stop the New York Stock Exchange from opening yesterday.
   Several hundred demonstrators, protesting what they said
is U.S. corporations' abuse of the environment, were met by
several hundred police officers who ringed the exchange
building at the corner of Broad and Wall streets.

   Exchange operations weren't disrupted. "The whole system
worked as it would on any other day," said a spokesman for
the Big Board.
   The exchange has increased security in recent months. In
September, a group of activists for victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome wore fake identification badges,
entered the trading floor and disrupted trading. That
demonstration was the most successful since August 1967, when
Abbie Hoffman and a dozen others threw dollar bills from the
visitors' gallery to the trading floor, causing havoc.
   A spokesman for the police department said two
demonstrators were arrested and charged with assaulting
police officers. One other protester was charged with
possessing Chemical Mace. Five officers and four
demonstrators suffered minor injuries.
   The demonstration began at about 6 a.m. EDT and lasted a
few hours. Demonstrators attempted to block the path of
exchange employees heading to work. But police closed off a
section of Wall Street to all traffic and pedestrians except
those who work on the block.
   One demonstrator carried a giant makeshift hypodermic
needle marked "Fossil Fuel Junkies." Another was dressed in a
white zippered suit on which had been written the names of
various chemicals and elements such as toluene, CFC, or
chlorofluorocarbons, and mercury.
   And a man who would identify himself only as a student at
State University of New York, Stony Brook, was trying to give
away dollar bills to financial types heading to work. He said
corporations were ignoring environmental needs for the sake
of profits. "I know that deep in the heart of every worker on
Wall Street is a profound lust for money," he said.
