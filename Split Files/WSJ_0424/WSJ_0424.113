   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Troubled Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association said its chief financial officer, David A. Sachs,
resigned effective May 11 to pursue "other business
opportunities."
   Neither Mr. Sachs nor the company could be reached for
comment yesterday evening. But in a statement, Columbia said
that Edward G. Harshfield, who was named president and chief
executive of the insolvent thrift last month, would serve as
acting chief financial officer until a successor to Mr. Sachs
could be found.

   The thrift, once one of the nation's most profitable
because of its massive junk-bond holdings, was sent reeling
because of its junk-bond portfolio. Earlier this month, the
thrift said that declines of 50% or more in its junk-bond
holdings contributed to its insolvency.
   For the fourth quarter, Columbia had a loss of $379.1
million, or $19.17 a share. The worse-than-expected results
have left Columbia teetering on the edge of federal
receivership.
