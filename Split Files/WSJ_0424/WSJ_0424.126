   Beckman Instruments Inc. reported first-quarter net income
fell 25% to $8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $10.7
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped
7.1% to $185.5 million from $199 million.
   The company attributed much of the decline to tight market
conditions among firms serving publicly-funded biological
research. Beckman, based in Fullerton, Calif., makes and
sells diagnostic and life-sciences laboratory instruments and
related systems.
