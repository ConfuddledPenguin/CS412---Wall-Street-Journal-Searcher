   New Haven, Conn. -- For Katarina Witt, this is the best
and the worst of times. East Germany's gift to figure skating
is finally realizing what not long ago seemed an impossible
dream: co-starring with American Olympian Brian Boitano in
their own globe-hopping ice show. But the same freedom that's
putting Witt in control of passport and purse strings has
turned the rest of the 24-year-old's world topsy-turvy.
   Once a proud model of socialist rectitude, East Germany's
most prominent athletic champion has become the equally
reviled symbol of the ancien regime. Witt's erstwhile
comrades are demanding to know about all sorts of things --
like the country bungalow, the Volkswagen car. Like the
reported under-the-table performance bonuses. And while Witt
can leave the country, she can't escape the questions.

   "I was very disappointed when I heard about all these
things that the government did," the skater said during a
break in rehearsals for the tour, a pensive look playing
across her cover-girl features. "But I always thought the
system must tell the truth and I believed it. Now you find
out they lied a lot, and I was really disappointed. I mean
I'm very thankful I had the chance to skate but now I feel
that we athletes were used.
   "And it's hard for me to change the past, too," Witt
continued, with as much care as she used to trace compulsory
figures. "Suddenly everything what you learned before,
everything you did, was wrong. I'm just totally confused in
my head and I need time . . . that's why it's hard for me to
answer all these questions."
   For the next six months Witt hopes to let her skating do
the talking. That's how long the company of 14 will play
arenas in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan on a tour that
began last week.
   Ironically, "Brian Boitano and Katarina Witt Skating"
began as a statement of sorts. "I thought of it as an
East-West thing, a kind of peace tour," explained the
26-year-old Boitano, who came up with the idea of a
production uniting skaters from the U.S., Canada, the
U.S.S.R. and the G.D.R. in the warm afterglow of his and
Witt's victories at the '88 Olympics.
   Back then the thought of the Sweetheart of Karl Marx Stadt
teaming up with the Bay Area's Golden Boy seemed rather
farfetched -- especially to East German authorities. Witt
says it took six months of wheedling -- and something of a
snow job -- for her to win approval of her first project with
Boitano, an '88 ABC TV special. "I didn't ever really tell
them what the story (a love story) is about," she giggled. "I
just said, `Well, they're going to be showing pieces of East
Germany.' "
   The authorities permitted the pair to reteam for the movie
"Carmen on Ice" (watch for rebroadcasts of the film, which
shows off Witt's considerable acting as well as skating
skills, on HBO). And they allowed Witt to join the European
tour of "Holiday on Ice" -- in return for a chunk of hard
currency. Witt got to keep a percentage of her fees, but
declines to discuss specifics beyond saying, "It was not nice
the way they handled it."
   Despite the mint East Germany might have made, Witt's
sports federation nixed many of the offers that came her way.
But all of this began to change last fall when the Wall came
down -- while Witt was in Seville filming "Carmen." "She was
excited but I think she was more stunned," recalled Boitano,
one of the few to penetrate Witt's personal wall. (The
friendship has prompted rumors of romance, which both deny;
up close they seem more like a playful brother and sister.)
"Kati was . . . nervous to go back home because she didn't
know if it was going to be the same country."
   She had every reason to be apprehensive. Back in the U.S.
following the filming, Boitano was alarmed by reports of an
anti-athlete -- particularly an anti-Witt-backlash. "I called
her in East Germany and said, `You got to get out of there]'
" Witt reassured her friend that things were not that bad,
and stood her ground.
   Now, Witt maintains, the worst is over. "Ja, there was
resentment, but I think this is gone because they really see
we did hard work," she stated. "I was upset when they said we
were privileged and getting this and this, but I think we
deserved it. Like here in this country, too, if you're a very
good athlete you make so much money and you're treated so
nicely and it's just the same -- but on another level. If I
would have lived here I would have made millions, you know. I
would be safe until the end of my life already."
   As it is, the two-time Olympic gold medalist still has to
skate for her supper. And she couldn't have found a classier
showcase than "Brian Boitano and Katarina Witt Skating."
   From the opening moments of the performance here at the
Coliseum last week, the difference between this and the
typical glitzy ice extravaganza is clear. The first thing you
hear in the dimly lit arena is the sound of blades. The first
you see -- barely -- is a solitary figure swooping across the
ice. It's Boitano, and just as suddenly he's gone. A solo
piano begins to play and out glides the company in costumes
as elegantly simple as the music, joining hands for an
instant to form moving figures, then as gracefully
dispersing.
   Some of the faces are familiar, like '84 Olympic silver
medalist Rosalynn Sumners and former world pairs champions
Elena Valova and Oleg Vasiliev. Others aren't, but by the end
of the evening will be, such as Canada's kinetic Gary Beacom,
who's created a whole new movement vocabulary for himself. As
they skate off, the piano piece slides seamlessly into a
ballad (both are by Boitano favorite David Foster), and the
lights pick out the most famous face of all: Katarina Witt.
   In her filmy high-necked white dress, chestnut hair caught
up in a French braid, Witt looks like an ice maiden Renoir
might have imagined. As she skates through director Sandra
Bezic's flowing choreography there's a lovely delicacy to the
way she moves her arms and hands, a lightness to her jumps.
When she swirls into a layback spin, her long neck arching
above the icicle -- like ribbons now fanning out from her
costume, she is picture-perfect.
   As the cheers die down her cavalier, Boitano, appears to
present Witt with a red rose before she skates off. It's one
of the graceful transitions Bezic, a former Canadian pairs
champion who also choreographed the "Carmen" film, uses to
maintain the show's flow. Then up come the stirring strains
of "Man of La Mancha," and Boitano charges into the kind of
commanding, athletically challenging display nobody does
better.
   He rips off the triples that seem to come out of thin air,
testing himself in ways most audiences won't even appreciate
-- for instance slowing his momentum with a spread-eagle
circle before his already impossibly difficult Tano Triple.
You see why Boitano hopes to defend his Olympic crown. (Next
month the International Skating Union is scheduled to rule on
allowing professionals to compete.)
   But this evening isn't really about jumps, triple or
otherwise. At heart the show is what the title says: Brian
Boitano and Katarina Witt skating. Alone and together.
   In their two solos apiece and their two paired numbers,
Bezic shows us skaters who are in some respects worlds apart
yet share so much. Witt's routines reveal a woman of many
faces -- first the innocent, then a fanny-waggling chorine,
and finally the fated Carmen -- but she always is the
charismatic performer who feeds off the audience. Boitano is
more solitary in his virtuosity, constantly stretching
himself to go higher, further, faster.
   And yet when they come together in the climactic "Carmen"
number, adapted from the film, the two make a convincing
couple. In this passionate pasodoble they share not only
longing looks but a common musicality and elegance of line.
Together and terrific.
