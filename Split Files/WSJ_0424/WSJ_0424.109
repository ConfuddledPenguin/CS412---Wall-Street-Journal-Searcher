   NEW YORK -- Commission rates paid by large investors on
stock trades, which have been falling for more than a decade,
may have finally hit a low point.
   While skeptics dismiss it as no more than wishful thinking
by brokers, indications that institutional commission rates
have firmed -- and may even increase -- have surfaced in a
new study by Greenwich Associates, Greenwich, Conn.,
consultants who do exhaustive research on the investment
industry.

   Greenwich's latest survey of 600 institutional investors
found that the 115 largest, each of which pays $5 million or
more in annual commissions, expect their pershare costs to
rise this year. Though the expected climb is tiny -- to an
average of 6.6 cents a share from 6.5 cents in 1989 -- it
marks the first time since 1980 that Greenwich turned up
evidence that large institutional commissions are on the
rise. Greenwich has been conducting the study for 17 years.
   "One-tenth of a cent does not a trend make, but it is the
first time that it hasn't gone south" in a decade, Greenwich
consultant James A. Bennett Jr. said of the institutional
rate. But the aggregate forecast from all 600 institutional
investors surveyed showed that commissions are expected to
slip to 8.7 cents a share from 8.9 cents this year.
   Even if commission rates for big investors have hit bottom
at about 6.6 cents a share, they are still too low for
brokers to make a profit trading stocks for customers, said
Kevin L. Risen, brokerage analyst at Banc One Asset
Management Corp. "Eight to 10 cents a share is what I
consider to be a level they can make a profit at," he said.
   And stock trading executives see little inclination by any
of their customers to allow rates to move up quickly.
   Robert M. Dewey Jr., managing director, equity trading and
sales, at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said
that while institutions are talking about paying a bit more,
few are taking action. "You could put on one hand all the
people that have stepped up to the plate and said, `I want to
take my seven-cent commission up to eight cents,'" he said.
   With Wall Street's trading capacity still far larger than
necessary to handle the available business, many brokerage
executives remain doubtful that the slide in institutional
commission rates is over.
   "From what we have seen in the first quarter, there is no
indication that commissions are going up," said Stanley S.
Abel, chairman of Abel/Noser Corp., which specializes in
measuring stock trading costs. Brokers, he said, are "trying
to talk rates up," but customers still hold the upper hand.
   Ever since brokerage firms were forced to end their system
of fixed stock-commission rates in 1975, per-share trading
costs paid by big investors have declined steadily, squeezing
Wall Street's stock trading profits. And according to a big
securities firm, which declined to be identified, commission
rates kept tumbling in the first quarter of this year. An
executive at this firm said that from 1988 to 1989, average
commissions paid to the firm fell 4.79% to 6.56 cents a
share. For the first quarter of this year, commissions fell
another 2% to 6.42 cents a share, the lowest in this firm's
history.
   Some big investment firms are paying even less.
Independence Investment Associates, a money-management arm of
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., is typical of the big
investors that have significantly lowered their trading
costs. Independence's per-share commissions have fallen an
average of 10% annually in the past 15 years to 5.3 cents in
1989 from 25.6 cents in 1974.
   Still, some institutional investors said they are worried
that the drop in rates has gotten to the point that they are
paying hidden costs through the pricing and timing of their
stock trades.
   "We're starting to get a little concerned that we've
pushed these {commission} costs so low that maybe it is
affecting prices," said William F. Quinn, president of AMR
Investment Services Inc., which manages $6 billion for
employees of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and other clients.
"We're hearing from a broad base of {money} managers that
liquidity isn't what it used to be," he said.
   As a result, Mr. Quinn said, he has authorized his outside
money managers to pay higher commissions if necessary, which
has resulted in AMR's per-share rate rising by perhaps half a
penny above its previous five-cents-a-share cost. "We've said
to managers that if they need to pay a little more
{commission} to get a trade done at the best price, they
should do it," he said.
   Joseph W. Perrone, chief investment officer of the $24
billion Texas Teacher Retirement System, also believes big
investors may have pushed Wall Street as hard as they can.
For the Texas teachers fund, with $9.5 billion in stocks,
saving a penny on the fund's average commission cost of six
to seven cents a share could easily get lost "in the noise
level," Mr. Perrone said. "While I'm sitting there
negotiating for one cent a share, I could lose $100,000 in
the market."
   "You've got to let those guys make some money or they
can't stay in business," he said. "We can just tell the
brokers not to write any commissions and they will just mark
up the stock."
   Mr. Dewey of Donaldson Lufkin said that despite customers'
haggling over ordinary business, large blocks that require
his firm to put up money to facilitate the trade are
commanding higher commissions. "When it comes to using our
capital to do a trade -- almost everybody is willing to pay
for that," he said.
   But some investors still believe the cost of trading is
too high in many cases. "I don't think it's low enough for
large traders," said Greta Marshall, former chief investment
officer of the $56 billion California Public Employees
Retirement System and now a money manager heading her own
firm.
   While she was at the California pension fund, Ms. Marshall
helped halve its average commission rate to five cents a
share, cutting off brokers who refused to adjust their fees.
But she noted that a nickel-a-share commission still amounts
to $500 on a 10,000-share trade. "It just doesn't cost that
much for a {trade} ticket," she said.
   Brokers, Ms. Marshall said, should boost charges to very
active traders, such as hedge funds, and cut them for those
who are usually in less of a hurry to get trades done, such
as pension funds.
   "The Street says, `We're not making any money,'" Ms.
Marshall said. "I say, `Maybe that's because you're
inefficient and you're not making people pay for things that
they use.'"
