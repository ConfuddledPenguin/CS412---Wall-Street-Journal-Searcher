   TORONTO -- Imperial Oil Ltd. said it hopes to raise about
one billion Canadian dollars (US$861.5 million) from asset
sales by the end of this year to help reduce its high debt
levels.
   Ronald Brenneman, senior vice president and chief
financial officer of Imperial Oil, told shareholders at the
annual meeting that in this year's first quarter, the
integrated oil and gas company completed the sale of more
than C$200 million of oil and gas properties.

   Imperial Oil, in which New York-based Exxon Corp. holds a
69.9% stake, said last Friday that it agreed to sell its 23%
stake in Interhome Energy Inc. to Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.
for C$492 million.
   Mr. Brenneman said other "non-core assets" are up for sale
this year, including some refining and marketing properties.
He didn't elaborate.
   He said that the asset sales, increased cash flow (net
income plus depreciation) and reinvested stock dividends will
combine to cut debt to less than C$3 billion by the end of
this year from about C$4.4 billion last Dec. 31.
   Arden Haynes, chairman and chief executive officer,
predicted that for 1990, Imperial Oil "will probably match"
its 1989 net income of C$456 million, or C$2.54 a share, if
the asset sales go smoothly.
   Mr. Haynes said the company's ability to match 1989
results depends on interest rates and the cost of financing
its debt, as well as how quickly it is able to conclude the
asset sales.
   The company yesterday reported first-quarter net income
rose 33% to C$150 million, or 79 Canadian cents a share, from
C$113 million, or 68 Canadian cents a share. Revenue rose 33%
to C$2.63 billion from C$1.98 billion. The latest earnings
include a C$19 million gain from the sale of the oil and gas
properties.
