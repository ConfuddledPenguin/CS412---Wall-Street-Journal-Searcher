   TORONTO -- Toronto's Bronfman family took a step closer to
acquiring control of Unicorp Canada Corp. after agreeing to
backstop part of a 100 million Canadian dollar (US$85.8
million) rights offering.
   Under the proposed offering, Hees International Bancorp
Inc. and BrasPower Ltd., both indirectly controlled by
financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, could together take up
rights giving them as much as 69% of the voting shares of
Unicorp. Hees already has a 24% non-voting stake in the
company, acquired through a previous rights issue in January.

   BrasPower, jointly owned by Hees and Brascan Ltd., the
Bronfmans' resource-investment arm, has agreed to underwrite
up to C$50 million of the rights offering. James Leech,
Unicorp's president, said the Bronfman interests could
acquire between 17% and 69% of the voting shares of Unicorp,
depending on how many other shareholders take up their
rights.
   The rights will be granted all holders of both the Class A
non-voting and Class B voting Unicorp shares.
   The rights issue units will consist of a total of 10
million preferred shares and 10 million warrants to purchase
Unicorp's Class B voting shares. The units won't be priced
until all regulatory approvals have been received, a process
Unicorp said will take about 120 days.
   The Bronfman interests will also move to take operating
control of Unicorp almost immediately. George Mann, founder
and controlling shareholder of Unicorp, said he is stepping
down as chairman and passing responsibility for the company's
day-to-day operations to Robert Dunford, executive
vice-president of Brascan and president of BrasPower. Mr.
Mann couldn't be reached for comment as to whether he plans
to take up his rights.
   Brascan, which has a two-year right to buy Hees'
non-voting stake in Unicorp, is interested in expanding its
utility operations as a "fourth leg" to complement its other
resource investments. These include a 42% stake in Noranda
Inc., the giant Toronto-based mining, forest products and
energy concern.
   Unicorp is in the throes of a major restructuring which
will leave it as a company with assets in the energy sector.
Through 60%-owned Union Energy Inc., Unicorp controls
Canada's second-largest natural gas distribution company,
Union Gas Ltd., Calgary oil and gas producer Mark Resources
Ltd., as well as natural gas marketing and transportation
concerns.
   As part of that restructuring, the company plans to pay
out as dividends shares of the troubled Unicorp American
Corp. to common shareholders of Unicorp Canada. The American
unit's major remaining asset is Lincoln Savings Bank, which
is being held for disposition.
   Unicorp said BrasPower will provide a C$50 million credit
facility to assist in the restructuring of Unicorp American
and support the operations of Union Energy.
   Brascan officials couldn't be reached for comment. But
Trevor Eyton, its president, said after the annual meeting in
May that he expects Brascan to acquire Hees's stake in
Unicorp before the end of the year. He also noted that
Brascan usually wants a stake of between 40% and 50% in its
major corporate investments.
