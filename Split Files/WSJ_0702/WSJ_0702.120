   Great American Bank said it replaced longtime chairman and
chief executive officer Gordon Luce, a move that analysts
said reflected stepped-up regulatory control of the troubled
San Diego thrift.
   Great American selected Robert L. Kemper, 61 years old, a
former Wells Fargo &amp; Co. executive, most recently affiliated
with the New York merchant banking firm of Gregory &amp;
Honemeyer. Besides succeeding Mr. Luce as chairman and chief
executive, Mr. Kemper will also assume the post of president,
succeeding Roger K. Lindland. Mr. Lindland's future wasn't
clear, although a Great American trustee said he would
continue as a consultant. The moves are effective today.

   Great American, the nation's eighth largest thrift, has
been ordered by federal regulators to raise $350 million by
year end or face seizure by the government. Analysts doubt
the company's ability to do that, although officials have
indicated they are trying to sell much of Great American's
lucrative Southern California branch network as a way of
raising the desperately needed cash.
   The move to replace the 64-year-old Mr. Luce, who
announced in May that he would be stepping down sometime this
year, suggested to some analysts that Great American's fate
may soon be resolved. "You could call it a
quasi-conservatorship or a very quiet conservatorship," said
Allan Bortel, an investment banker specializing in thrifts
with Sutro &amp; Co., San Francisco. "It's the regulators' way of
saying `we would like to raise $350 million, but they know
it's not possible.'"
   Mr. Kemper wasn't available for comment. He contended in a
statement that he was "looking forward to addressing the
issues facing the bank and working with its shareholders and
customers."
   His hiring followed what Great American called "an
extensive interview process." The company had earlier tried
to lure James Cirona, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
president, as a successor to Mr. Luce, but apparently
couldn't reach financial terms, Great American previously
indicated.
   For Mr. Luce, a former member of Ronald Reagan's informal
group of "Kitchen Cabinet" advisers, the changing of the
guard is a rather swift fall from grace. He joined the
company in 1970 and built it into one of the nation's biggest
thrifts, only to have its financial condition shattered over
the past year by the effects of a 1986 venture into Arizona
real estate.
   Great American said Mr. Luce continues as a trustee.
