   Whittle Communications Limited Partnership said it hired
Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC-TV's "Good Morning America,"
under a three-year contract to host a new program that will
play in doctors' waiting rooms, beginning in the fall.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., and 50%-owned by Time
Warner Inc., New York, said it hopes its Special Reports
Television will play in as many as 20,000 family doctors'
offices by January. The TV system will be coupled with
Whittle's Special Reports magazines, which are distributed in
about 19,000 medical offices. Whittle said about
three-fourths of the physicians who receive these magazines
have signed up for the TV program.

   Whittle takes in about $40 million a year in advertising
from the magazines and hopes to double the revenue with the
addition of the TV show, which will have an hour-long format
divided into eight segments on family issues and be updated
every two weeks on videodisk.
   A spokeswoman for ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.,
New York, said Ms. Lunden recently signed a new five-year
contract for "Good Morning America."
