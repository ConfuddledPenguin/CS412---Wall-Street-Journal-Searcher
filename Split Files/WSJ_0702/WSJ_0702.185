   NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court ruled that
state-regulated utilities can be sued under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
   The decision by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in Manhattan reversed part of a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Jack B. Weinstein, who overturned a RICO jury verdict against
Long Island Lighting Co. in 1989.

   The appeals court upheld other aspects of Judge
Weinstein's decision, however, and agreed that the verdict
should have been overturned. The case dealt with allegations
that Lilco lied to New York state regulators to obtain higher
rates to finance the Shoreham nuclear power plant. The closed
plant on Long Island is now owned by New York state.
   The appeals court said that utilities can be sued under
RICO, although the law -- and its legislative history --
doesn't directly address the issue. Judge Weinstein had ruled
that applying RICO in cases involving utilities would be an
intrusion of federal law in areas historically controlled by
state governments.
   The appeals court said, "While ambiguities as to what
conduct constitutes a violation may lurk in the RICO statute,
the statute isn't ambiguous as to whether its proscriptions
extend to a state-regulated public utility." Since a public
utility is an "entity capable of holding a legal . . .
interest in property," as RICO requires, it falls under the
scope of the law, the court said.
   In the decision, the appeals court also upheld a related
settlement that Lilco reached with ratepayers in 1989 to
reduce electric rates by $390 million over ten years. The
appeals court rejected claims that the judge improperly
approved too small an amount.
