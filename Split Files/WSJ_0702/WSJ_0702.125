   Less than a year after buying 25% of Spain's Grupo Zeta
S.A., media owner Rupert Murdoch wants out.
   Zeta, a Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher, said it
is negotiating with various international groups interested
in acquiring a stake in Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC,
a unit of the Australia-based News Corp. Zeta holds the stake
that is for sale in News International.

   Zeta gave no details about possible purchasers. But it
said Mr. Murdoch decided to sell after Zeta's chairman,
Antonio Asensio, rejected a request for News International to
be allowed to raise its stake.
   Zeta said Mr. Asensio, its founder and 70% shareholder,
had no intention of reducing his majority holding.
   "In this situation," Zeta added, "News International made
known its intention of selling its holding to obtain funds
with which to meet its liquidity requirements."
