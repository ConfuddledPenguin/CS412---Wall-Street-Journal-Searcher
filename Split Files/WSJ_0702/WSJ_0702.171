   SALT LAKE CITY -- Alta Gold Co. said it laid off 66
employees as it suspended mining operations at its Easy
Junior gold mine near Ely, Nev.
   The mining concern cited slumping gold prices and
increased operational costs. It said it would resume
production at the mine by year end "if the price of gold
permits." Alta, which operates four gold mines, has about 450
employees, reflecting a reduction of about 230 workers since
gold prices began slipping earlier this year.
