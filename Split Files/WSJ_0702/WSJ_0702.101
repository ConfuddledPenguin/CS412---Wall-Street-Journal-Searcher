   Bohemia Inc. said it will permanently close its Culp Creek
plywood facility within two months, citing a timber shortage
expected to be compounded by the federal government's
decision to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened
species.
   The move will affect the jobs of 248 employees of the
Eugene, Ore.-based concern. Rising material costs --
resulting from loss of access to old growth forests -- and
sagging plywood prices were factors in the decision to close
the facility. The company said the situation is "expected to
worsen" because of the Bush administration's decision last
month on the spotted owl.

   The plant, also in Oregon, generated $20 million of the
company's $350 million revenues in fiscal 1990. Richard D.
Tinney, Bohemia's president and chief executive officer, said
the company will try to place as many employees as possible
in its other facilities.
