   The dollar is expected to show gains against the mark in
July, but remain steady against the yen, according to
economists and traders.
   But the "German question," of whether West Germany can
swallow East Germany without indigestion, likely won't be
answered until late summer, they say. They do believe the
mark will survive, but they say it won't be without a fight.

   At the end of July, the dollar will gain three pfennigs to
1.691 marks, according to the average forecast of 10
economists and traders in New York, London, Frankfurt and
Tokyo surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service on the
eve of the German economic and monetary union, which was
completed yesterday. The average forecast for the end of
September is 1.712 marks to the dollar.
   The dollar-yen exchange rate is expected to remain
exceptionally steady, while the dollar is seen rising against
the British pound and the Swiss franc, in part because the
latter currencies are expected to shadow the mark's
movements. The dollar is forecast at 154.30 yen at the end of
July and 153.40 yen at the end of September.
   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6610
marks, below 1.6730 marks late Thursday, and at 152.20 yen,
below 153.15 yen late Thursday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading
at 152.15 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at 152.85 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6574
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6713 marks.
   On Friday, Ingo Kuller, chief trader at Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale in Duesseldorf, cast the two most
bullish projections for the dollar against the mark in the
belief that the dollar remains undervalued against the mark
and is overdue for a rally.
   Since the Berlin Wall was breached on Nov. 9, the dollar
has risen about 10% against the mark, with most of the gains
made in the first three months.
   Mr. Kuller cautioned, however, that the effects of
monetary union with East Germany make all forecasts
extraordinarily difficult. "Who knows how the markets are
going to react to monetary union?" Mr. Kuller mused, voicing
a common uncertainty.
   Ernst Pullmann, chief trader for Deutsche Girozentrale
Deutsche Kommunalbank in Frankfurt, said the uncertainties
and surprises coming out of East Germany "won't have as large
an impact as some people think." Mr. Pullmann expects the
mark to resume its long-term ascent as the summer progresses.
   Japanese investors, Mr. Pullmann predicted, "will show up
as much stronger investors," he said. "The Japanese are going
to need marks to invest in East Germany. The recent firmness
of the yen against the mark will prove to be only temporary."
   The key question in economists' minds is how East Germans
will react to having their pockets full of West German marks.
The conversion of East German currency to West German
currency boosted the money supply by about 10% overnight, and
some believe East Germans will go on a buying spree, spurring
inflation. One U.S. foreign exchange dealer evoked the image
of kids in a candy store.
   Many economists, however, say the prospect of massive
unemployment in East Germany will spur more saving than
spending.
   Analysts who focused on interest rates were in agreement
that German rates aren't headed down, while U.S. rates quite
possibly are.
   The wild card in the U.S. rate-easing scenario, according
to Jerry Egan, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston, is the
release Friday of U.S. employment data for June. "If the
employment data show a weak number, there will be a lot more
talk about easing," Mr. Egan said, but he doubted whether the
Federal Reserve would make a move before autumn.
   Impetus for a looser monetary policy could also come from
an ambitious deficit-reduction proposal, which U.S.
negotiators promised their Japanese counterparts in trade
talks completed last week in return for Japanese concessions.
U.S. President George Bush, in a news conference Friday, said
a deficit-reduction pact likely would speed economic growth
despite any new taxes, paving the way for the Federal Reserve
to ease interest rates.
   Most of the survey's respondents said the dollar's
exchange rates with sterling and the Swiss franc will be
dominated by those currencies' relationships with the mark.
   At the end of June, the average forecast put the pound at
$1.7160, below $1.7485 late Friday in New York. In 90 days,
the pound is expected to be worth $1.6975.
   "Always think in terms of the cross," said Eric Nickerson,
vice president and economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco. "The sterling-dollar is going to fall more out of
the cross than from any mood regarding sterling-dollar
directly," he said. The reason is sterling's probable entry
in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary
System (EMS) this year.
   Geoffrey Dennis, an economist with James Capel &amp; Co. Ltd.,
said sterling's strength rests "almost solely" with the
market's perception that Britain is about to put the pound
inside the ERM.
   The pound now ranges close to where the market thinks
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wants it to enter the ERM,
leading some observers to believe the entry will come as
early as July and no later than October.
   The Swiss franc is seen slipping against the dollar but
gaining on the mark. In 30 days, the forecast calls for the
dollar to trade at 1.4318 francs, above 1.4150 francs late
Friday in New York. In 90 days, the dollar would trade at
1.4490 francs, the survey predicted.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery jumped $5.80 to $357.90 an ounce. It was the
highest close since June 5. Estimated volume was a moderate
3.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $357.45 an
ounce.
