   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Legislature approved an
interstate banking bill that will allow banks outside of New
England to open or buy banks in the state.
   Until now, only banks based in other New England states
have been able to enter the Massachusetts market.

   The bill will permit interstate banking 60 days after its
expected signing by the governor. However, a bank can choose
to opt out of the interstate banking provisions until July 1,
1992, by a two-thirds vote of its directors.
   Analysts don't expect the legislation to result in a
flurry of bank takeovers, largely because many of the state's
banks are struggling under the real estate and general
economic slump and thus aren't considered attractive targets
for outsiders.
