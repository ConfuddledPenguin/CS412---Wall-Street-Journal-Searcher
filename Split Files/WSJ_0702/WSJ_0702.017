   NEW YORK -- AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories researchers said they
have designed a fiber-optic transmission system to send high
volumes of communications traffic over huge distances without
costly signal regeneration equipment.
   The system combines a new kind of optical glass fiber
containing the rare-earth erbium with pump lasers developed
by Bell Labs two years ago to exploit the science of
solitons, or low-resistance waves.

   While the new system is still several years from
commercialization, scientists at American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.'s research and development unit said it should
greatly benefit undersea cable systems, potentially expanding
capacity by a factor of 10 and cutting costs by a similar
amount.
   "This {new system} has got a lot of us really excited,"
said Jack M. Sipress, director of undersea systems at Bell
Labs. "Our research has shown that we can get a {light} pulse
across the ocean with no conversion equipment, {turning} the
cable into a hollow pipe that's capable of handling greater
amounts of traffic."
   The current trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable, called
TAT-8, costs about $350 million and is capable of carrying
40,000 phone conversations simultaneously at 280 million
bits-per-second (megabits). Next year, a TAT-9 system will go
into operation with the capacity to carry 80,000 calls
simultaneously at 560 megabits. The new system offers
capacity of 700,000 simultaneous phone calls and transmission
capacity of five billion bits-per-second, said Mr. Sipress.
Systems offering such capacity will be necessary in the
future to handle an expected huge increase in video
transmissions, as well as in voice and data traffic.
   However, Mr. Sipress cautioned that the work led by
scientist Linn F. Mollenauer must still undergo several more
years of rigorous testing, including field trials, before
future AT&amp;T transmission systems can incorporate the new
design. But "this lays the foundation for engineering actual
systems," he said.
   In today's optical cable systems, signals sent by laser
light pulses deteriorate over long distances due to the glass
fiber's refractive qualities. To keep the signal active,
optical cable systems such as the trans-Atlantic cable must
use a chain of electrical/electronic repeaters inserted at
intervals of 50 to 80 kilometers along the fiber cable. Each
repeater takes the weakened signal from a laser located at
the end of the cable and electrically amplifies it before
regenerating the signal via laser and sending it on to the
next repeater in the chain.
   While the system of repeaters works, it's inefficient
because it creates choke points for signals that originate
and terminate on either end of the cable, which in the case
of submarine cables are located on shore, said Mr. Sipress.
These repeaters are difficult and costly to repair especially
if the fix must be made in mid-ocean.
   AT&amp;T's new system may change all of this. Erbium's unique
luminescent properties provide optical gain in regions of the
fiber through which signals are transmitted and where there
is the least optical loss. Pump lasers, developed by Bell
Laboratories in 1988 by Mr. Mollenauer, amplify "soliton"
optical communications pulses so that they maintain their
shape over long distances.
   Mr. Mollenauer discovered that when an erbium-laced fiber
is attached to the end of a standard glass fiber at 25-30
kilometer intervals along with a pump laser, the erbium-doped
pieces act as natural signal boosters, eliminating the need
for expensive electrical conversion equipment. Recently, he
used the system in his laboratory to transmit signals 10,000
kilometers with no electrical conversion. That's more than
double the record-breaking 4,000 kilometers over which Mr.
Mollenauer transmitted a light pulse two years ago, using
only soliton pump lasers.
   "The impact of this in terms of new equipment is five
years away, at least," said Richard Mack, an analyst at
Kessler Marketing Intelligence Corp., Newport, R.I. "But it's
a significant advance."
   High-capacity systems such as the one designed by Mr.
Mollenauer is the latest in a series of fiber-optic
breakthroughs to come out of Bell Labs this year. Earlier,
the company demonstrated an optical switch that will be the
basis for future super high-capacity switching systems
capable of handling voice, data and video traffic from
high-speed optical systems with no electronic intervention.
