   OSLO -- Striking oil workers began shutting down Norway's
offshore petroleum production after last-minute talks failed
to settle on a new contract, the union said.
   The Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers said the strike
could be a long one, but didn't estimate when the strike
might end.

   Norway's North Sea fields produced 1.63 million barrels a
day of oil and 1.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
month in April, the latest official figures available. Norway
and the U.K. are Europe's largest petroleum producers.
   The government has urged both sides to continue
negotiations, noting that roughly 25% of Norway's national
income comes from petroleum, and "a strike could be grave for
our economy," a government spokesman said.
   The union said the 2.5% pay raise offered to offshore
workers is less than half its demand. The union also said the
strike defends workers' negotiation rights and protests
increased automation that may cost jobs.
   Management maintains that the union's average annual wage,
313,000 kroner ($48,700), is already 85% higher than the
average wage in mainland industry.
