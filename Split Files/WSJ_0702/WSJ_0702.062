   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston adopted a stockholder rights
plan, adding to its defenses against possible takeovers
attempts.
   The plan's many provisions are triggered if any person or
group buys 15% or more of the common shares. At that point,
existing stockholders have the right to purchase newly issued
shares at "a substantial discount," diluting the position of
anyone attempting an unwanted takeover, company officials
said.

   As with the other New England banks, Bank of Boston has
reason to be defensive, analysts say. Its first-quarter
profit fell to $44 million, less than half of what it was in
the quarter a year ago. Bank of Boston's return on assets of
0.46% and return on equity of 8% are well below what many
major banks earn, said James Moynihan, an analyst with Advest
Group Inc.
   "Given the decade we've just gone through it makes sense
to be defensive," says Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne J.
Taylor, "to be protective of the long-term share value of the
company."
   Bank of Boston officials have lobbied against a bill
passed Friday by the Massachusetts Legislature that opens the
state to nationwide interstate banking. (The bill now awaits
signing by the governor.) Executives have said they will opt
for a provision in the bill allowing banks to not participate
in interstate banking until 1992.
   Analysts point out that these defensive moves are more for
future protection than for any current threat.
   "At this point, who would want to buy it?" says Carol
Berger, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, noting the general
economic problems in New England. "It'd be like bidding into
a blind pool of risk."
