   WASHINGTON -- Peru is trying to mend its relations with
the international financial community.
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori met Friday in New York
with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel
Camdessus, World Bank President Barber Conable and the
president of the Inter-America Development Bank, Enrique
Iglesias, to discuss normalizing relations with these
agencies.

   Mr. Fujimori, at the meetings, outlined an economic
austerity plan that he intends to implement when he takes
office at the end of this month. It includes tax increases
and other revenue-boosting measures.
   The meetings were arranged by Javier Perez de Cuellar,
secretary general of the United Nations.
   Peru is more than $2 billion in arrears to international
agencies and has several billion dollars of unresolved
arrears with commercial banks. This includes about $850
million owed to the IMF, $720 million owed to the World Bank
and about $450 million owed to the IADB.
   Several months ago, Peru started normalizing its relations
with the IMF by resuming payments on its debt to the agency
but leaving its existing arrears unresolved. It has yet to
make such agreements with the World Bank and IADB and, since
1987, it generally has been at loggerheads with all of its
creditors.
