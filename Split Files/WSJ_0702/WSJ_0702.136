   Martin Tupper is a thirtyish New York City book editor
about to plunge into the single life. This is a man of many
worries: His wife is deserting him for another man, his
11-year-old son's affections also are drifting, and then,
there are the terrors of the modern dating scene.
   All this is the premise of a new comic series called, for
no very good reason, "Dream On," beginning on HBO on Sunday,
July 8, 10-10:30 p.m. EDT, and continuing on subsequent
Sundays. If the scenes described above seem familiar and
sitcom-like, it is because they are. Still, this 14-part
series, produced by John Landis (director of "Trading
Places," "Coming to America," "The Blues Brothers"), has
something more on its mind than you can find in the usual
sitcom about the newly single.

   What it has, mainly, is its aspiration, which is to
emulate the style of Dennis Potter's British miniseries "The
Singing Detective." That densely psychological life story of
a writer, which aired here on PBS in 1988, was perhaps the
most remarkable dramatic work ever undertaken for television,
in which past and present were continually merged and
characters broke into song at the oddest -- the darkest --
moments.
   Taking a cue from "The Singing Detective" -- to which it
bears, otherwise, not the slightest resemblance -- "Dream On"
fuses past and present, in this case with clips of old movies
and television. The one consistently interesting thing about
the series is the way the old footage is used. Still more
interesting is what it stands for: the values of the '40s and
'50s.
   The first episode introduces Brian Benben as the
distinctly nerdlike Martin Tupper. Give a male character a
name like Tupper, and have him portrayed by an actor who
happens to look a lot like Chevy Chase, as Mr. Benben does,
and already that character has been defined in a way from
which there is no return. It does not help that both Tupper's
circle of friends and his employees consist entirely of
people who browbeat him -- not least his vituperative
secretary.
   Tupper tries, with notable lack of success, to woo his
wife back. Rejected, he escapes, in fantasy, to the balm of
the old movies -- a time of high romance, when faithful love
was always rewarded in the end and errant lovers always
returned. Even as Tupper's wife is coldly telling him no
dice, his mind is rerunning an old movie clip starring Anne
Baxter as a faithless wretch, pleading for love from the man
she once abandoned. In another scene, Tupper plies his wife
with her favorite candy, along with some cornball mementoes
of their past -- all to no avail: The woman wants a divorce.
In response, the projector in his head flashes to another old
movie: a heroically handsome Zachary Scott looks
penetratingly into the eyes of his beloved and says, "Thank
you -- for being my wife."
   It is an irresistible moment. Still, this sort of thing
entails risks, given the shattering nature of the comparisons
a viewer is presented with here. One minute we are watching
Tupper wearing a funny hat and spitting candy out of his
mouth, the next we are watching Zachary Scott pouring
champagne for his glamorous blond wife. It is a comparison,
of course, that the maker of this series intended, but there
are other differences that stand out with a fearful clarity:
The difference in characterization, for example. The vapidity
of the dialogue between Tupper and his wife, heard hard on
the heels of the old-movie eloquence, yields the sort of
contrast the makers of "Dream On" cannot have intended.
   Still, there are aspects of this series that are sharp,
that bespeak a kind of knowingness and even some vision. On
the rebound, Tupper tries dating and finds himself revolted
at the range of possibilities available to him: ladies with
kinky sexual tastes -- one requires, for her satisfaction, a
lover who will lick whipped cream from her body; another
spends the first date briefing Tupper on her understandably
long history of rejection at the hands of the opposite sex.
Still another cannot understand why the discovery that she
has a husband should make any difference to Tupper.
   With these sorts of ladies, Tupper can be decisive, even
if he does take his time about it. Midway though his effort
to lap the whipped cream off various body parts, Tupper stops
dead. Undaunted, or perhaps inspired by, the gobs of cream in
his mouth, he bolts. He clearly has had a sudden realization,
an epiphany of sorts. Yes, he's left his partner unfulfilled,
but then epiphanies in the bedroom never come without cost.
   Tupper also dispatches the married lady. From all of this,
it would appear that the milquetoast Tupper is soon to be
revealed as a man of parts, discriminating enough to be
appalled by certain aspects of contemporary life and tastes,
however much others may, so to speak, lap them up. But that
is the case only fitfully: for this is a work subverted by
one of the most insidious of those contemporary tastes,
namely the wish to have things both ways. The creators of
this series clearly wanted to cast a critical eye at manners
and morals, to compare past with present, via the old film
clips, to be satiric. In the end, or to be precise, in the
middle, they back away from hard looks to a kind of sheepish
comedy about a man accommodating to new standards of
behavior.
   Tupper is at first shocked when, in the second episode,
his friend, a Geraldo-like talk-show host, introduces him to
the two teeny-boppers who are their dates for the evening.
What is he going to do with a girl too young to be served
liquor, Tupper wants to know? Tupper resists her, but not for
long, especially after he discovers the teeny-bopper
appreciates him as a person, as the saying goes. This makes
everything swell and so, as shadows draw nigh and evening is
near, Tupper ushers the girl up to his apartment, with manful
ease. We are now, of course, far from satire and well into a
story of "growth" and of the overcoming of hurdles -- the
sort of twaddle with which television writers are always
comfortable. The hurdles Tupper has managed to overcome may
be his scruples, but hey, progress is progress.
   Later in the series, "Dream On" takes a tentative swipe or
two more at new cultural values. In an episode entitled "Sex
and the Single Father," Tupper is horrified to discover that
his 11-year-old son knows about all the essentials of sex --
but that he requires more detailed information about advanced
technicalities for pleasuring women and also what his father
does for fun when he's alone. With each question the boy
throws at his father, we see an old clip of a boxing movie
with Lee Marvin taking repeated shots to the jaw. Again and
again we see this punch, an ironic emblem for this series,
which, despite estimable intentions, ends up pulling its
punches.
