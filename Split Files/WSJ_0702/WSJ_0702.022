   LOS ANGELES -- Foothill Group said it plans to write down
certain junk bonds in its portfolio, which will lead to an
estimated second-quarter net loss of between $3.8 million and
$4.3 million.
   The commercial lending and equipment leasing concern said
the pretax writedowns are $6 million at Foothill Thrift &amp;
Loan and $3 million at the parent Foothill Group. After tax,
the write-downs will total about $5.4 million.

   A year ago, Foothill reported second-quarter net income of
$3.2 million, or 32 cents a share.
   Henry Jordan, chief financial officer, said Foothill's
book value after the adjustments would be about $6.50 at June
30, and the company's junk-bond securities portfolio would be
less than 5% of consolidated assets. Mr. Jordan said the
portfolio writedowns are unrelated to Foothill's management
of about $130 million in distressed securities in two private
limited partnerships.
   In response to the announcement, Fitch Investors Service
affirmed Foothill Capital Corp.'s F-2 commercial paper,
noting that the financing unit has no high-yield bond
portfolio and is unaffected by the writedowns.
