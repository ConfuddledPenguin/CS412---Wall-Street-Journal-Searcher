   Early Friday morning, President Bush held a news
conference to try to answer some of the criticism that
followed his break with the pledge not to raise taxes, made
in front of the millions who watched his nomination to the
presidency. It was not a good performance. For the first time
since his election, the President showed no signs of his
customary buoyancy. Mr. Bush sounded apologetic and, worse,
defensive.
   The Bush presidency has reached a turning point. The
choice before Mr. Bush is whether to pursue a presidency of
economic growth or a presidency of conventional economics and
conventional politics. This is a crucially important
distinction, which to this day is not yet understood in
Washington or by many White House officials.

   The past three elections have been won by presidential
campaigns of economic growth. With the exception of Jack Kemp
and Pete du Pont, all of the opponents who ran against Mr.
Bush and Ronald Reagan -- both Democrats and Republicans --
represented conventional economic policies in which notions
such as outlays, receipts, deficits and interest rates are
all levers in a Rube Goldberg machine that fine-tunes and
pump-primes the economy.
   The candidates who won all three elections had a different
view. They made it clear that they understood the determining
role of taxes in a modern, highly competitive economy. If
taxes are cut (the Reagan presidency) or aren't increased
(the Bush promise), the economy's success is primarily in the
hands of the voters. This was the supply-side view. But if
taxes are being raised, the economy is being taken out of the
voters' hands and turned over to the Members of Congress.
   The President now seems to believe that events compel him
to stretch between these two poles. The danger is that if he
slips, he may emerge as the leader of the people whose
economic policies he defeated. The voters he led against new
congressional taxation will feel, with some justification,
that they've been abandoned.
   Mr. Bush said at his news conference that he thinks he
deserves support for this new course, a "make-or-break effort
at responsible government." Perhaps. After his
pledge-shattering announcement we expressed support for what
we took to be his definition of responsible government --
real reform of entitlements and so-called mandatory programs,
institutional reform of the budget process, new enforcement
mechanisms and a capital-gains cut, with taxes of some sort
as the price for this achievement. But there was none of this
in the news conference.
   Instead, Mr. Bush said a sequester would cause big cuts in
"student grants and a wide array of other domestic services."
Student grants? We took Mr. Bush's statement last Tuesday to
mean that cutting middle-class entitlements was a fundamental
goal of budget reform. If it isn't, what are we talking
about? The word coming out of the White House now is that it
is no longer interested in pursuing the line-item veto over
spending because Mr. Bush's advisers fear that the Democrats
will embarrass the President by forcing him to use it too
frequently. So where's the real reform?
   We worry that this budget summit is likely to proceed
along very conventional lines. The President on Friday
continuously cited the deficit as the reason for dropping his
pledge against new taxes. But if the deficit argument is
compelling enough to make him talk himself out of his
virtually sacred tax pledge, how long can it be before he's
talked himself out of real budget reform?
   We've always been struck at how successful conventional
Washington has been at putting the word "deficit" at the
center of the debate instead of "spending." That's
intentional. It is a strategy for making no lasting changes
in a corrupt system. It's a strategy for turning the budget
summit away from fundamental, long-term reform and fixating
solely on a number -- the $50 billion Holy Grail. The record
shows that Congress knows how to do this. But nothing about
its world really changes, and we soon end up back in the same
spending swamp, with the S&amp;L crisis replaced by some other
expensive screw-up, and the American people asked to support
a tax increase.
   There is a real question to be raised here about the state
of American politics. It isn't clear to us whether the
President appreciates how despondent the simple breaking of
his promise has left the electorate. Forget the economics. It
now appears that for many voters Mr. Bush and his tax pledge
were going to be one, rare instance of a modern politician
keeping his word. We were very struck after the recent
California balloting by a New York Times piece exploring the
reasons for another low voter turnout. One non-voter simply
said, "I find voting totally useless. The big wheels are
going to manipulate the system anyway." Our sense is that
this corrosive loss of trust in politics and politicians is
spreading fast in the U.S.
   People pay taxes willingly when they think they can trust
the government. They also might understand how Mr. Bush could
go back on his word if he could show that he got something in
return. But it was evident from the news conference that as
of now he has nothing. If, after breaking his pledge, he
comes away from these politicians with little more than a
run-of-the-mill deficit-reduction deal, we suspect it will be
bad for Mr. Bush's leadership, bad for his party and bad for
the relationship between the government and its citizens.
