   What does the Nazi murder of the Jews mean to Europeans
who are now building a new political order on their
continent? In "One, By One, By One: Facing the Holocaust"
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 318 pages, $21.95), Judith Miller, deputy
media editor of the New York Times, delivers a
country-by-country account of how Europeans distort their
past for maximum comfort. They package it, she says, instead
of thinking about it.
   "In every country . . .," writes Ms. Miller, "a
particularly national form of self-deception has usually
triumphed over self-revelation." Germany is the country with
the most responsibility for these individual tragedies, and,
Ms. Miller notes, the one that's spent the most time thinking
about that responsibility. Reflection, though, has brought
West Germans only "superficial tranquility." She takes a
lucid look at international controversies such as President
Reagan's visit to Bitburg. But her preferred tack is to study
the specific: how an old lady, Henny Oppenheimer, an exile
from the Nazis, returns to her hometown of Fulda and
discovers the grave of her first love, a slender fellow with
a musical voice; and how her meetings with living Fulda
residents resonate with strong feelings.

   "In Fulda," reported a Stanford student from a survivor
family, " `the Holocaust' was no longer an abstraction.
Suddenly, I was at the scene of the crime, the place where my
grandfather was murdered." Such town encounters, Ms. Miller
writes, help Germans build their new country and help
outsiders come to terms with post-Hitler "Deutschland." "Only
if the Germans fully confront their past can their neighbors
come to believe that history will not repeat itself."
   Ms. Miller is tougher on Austria. Since the war's end,
Austrians have clung to what she labels the "Sound of Music"
version of their history. They prefer to see themselves like
the von Trapp family in the film, as victims of their Nazi
overlords. Most real Austrians could barely stop clapping
when the Germans rolled into Vienna.
   Modern Austrians show no remorse, as they staunchly
support their ex-Nazi president Kurt Waldheim, who covered up
his complicity with the German army while he served as United
Nations secretary general in New York. The way Ms. Miller
sees it, the Austrians elected him partly because they hated
the way the world wouldn't accept their own lying image of
themselves as victims of German tyranny. She seems to agree
with an Austrian Jew who feels today's seemingly tolerant
youth will one day become "more anti-Semitic 50-year-olds."
   The view isn't so bleak in the Netherlands. But Ms. Miller
says the Dutch launder their war guilt by making a great show
of reverence for their most famous martyr to the Holocaust.
They have more or less canonized Anne Frank, the teen-age
diarist whom Dutch friends hid for two years, before Nazis
grabbed her and starved her to death at Bergen-Belsen.
   Occupied Holland, of course, was a mixed bag. Many of the
Dutch truly were Nazi victims. But their Anne Frank obsession
also has produced what Ms. Miller sees as an unwarranted
righteousness that ignores instances of Dutch collaboration:
". . . we prefer to blame the Germans," explains one
interviewee. "We say to ourselves it was all their fault;
even young people who have no memory of the war do so."
   As for France, intellectuals seem to have done the most
damage here of all. The French do discuss the Holocaust --
Ms. Miller describes a debate over Vichy collaboration that
spoils a presidential dinner party in the Elysee Palace. But
endless salon talk about the trial of "the Butcher of Lyon,"
Klaus Barbie, "seemed to skim across the surface of French
society," and did little but win votes for the National
Front, France's ultra-right party.
   Ms. Miller does a successful if wandering job of summing
up smaller countries, but her real talent shows when she gets
to bigger fish, like the Soviet Union. Because Soviet
ideology leans so heavily on the memory of what Russians call
"the Great Patriotic War," Soviet history is proving the
hardest of all to revise. To distract attention from the site
of the horrible massacre at Katyn, where Soviets murdered
more than 4,000 Polish officers in 1943, the U.S.S.R. set up
an ersatz memorial at a nearby town with a similar name,
"Khatyn." The victims at Khatyn happened, conveniently, to be
Soviet citizens incinerated when Germans burned this town to
the ground. Now the Soviet Union is filling in the "white
spots" in its history, and has publicly acknowledged the
Soviet responsibility for Katyn. But, Ms. Miller notes, a
complete rewrite of history is unlikely to come before the
Soviet Union faces change more profound than Mikhail
Gorbachev has brought.
   The Miller tour also makes a stop in the U.S., visiting
Holocaust archives and talking to survivors. But her real
target is Europe and Europe's glibly self-exculpatory
intellectuals, hiding away the death camps in a truly final
solution of verbal fog. "Abstraction," she writes, "is
memory's most ardent enemy." The best way to deal with the
Holocaust is to skip symbols and theory, and look at what
actually happened case by case -- "one by one."
