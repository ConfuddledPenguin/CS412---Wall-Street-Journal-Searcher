   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
ordered an investigation of Canada's beer import
restrictions.
   Mrs. Hills acted under the Section 301 provisions of U.S.
trade laws after G. Heileman Brewing Co. Inc., a
Wisconsin-based company, charged that Canadian provinces are
keeping U.S. beer out of the Canadian market.

   "American beer companies should be able to compete on a
fair basis in the Canadian market, just as Canadian brewers
do here," said Mrs. Hills, who added that Canadian brewers
are exporting five times as much beer to the U.S. as U.S.
brewers are able to export to Canada.
   Mrs. Hills said the U.S. intends to use the
disputes-settlement procedures of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) "to enforce our rights" to export
beer to Canada. Her decision, which was expected, pulls the
plug on a U.S. government inquiry that might lead to
retaliatory trade action if the beer dispute isn't resolved
through bilateral negotiations.
   Mrs. Hills previously discussed the Heileman complaint
with Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie, who conceded that
the beer marketing restrictions of Canadian provinces have
made Canada vulnerable to charges of violating its
international trade obligations.
   In 1988, a GATT panel in Geneva, acting on a complaint
from the European Community, ruled that Canada has
discriminated unfairly against imports of alcoholic
beverages.
