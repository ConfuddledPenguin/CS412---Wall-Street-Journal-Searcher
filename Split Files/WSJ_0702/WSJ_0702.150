   BUENOS AIRES -- Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia and
Telefonica S.A. of Spain were awarded a combined 60% share in
Argentina's state telephone company, Empresa Nacional de
Telecommunicaciones, or Entel, under a privatization plan.
   President Carlos Menem signed the decree, saying the two
companies' bids were the highest when bids were opened last
week.

   A formal takeover is scheduled for Oct. 8. Before then,
30% of the new company will be offered to investors and the
remaining 10% given to employees.
   Bell Atlantic, a regional telecommunications company, and
Telefonica, the Spanish state monopoly, paid a combined $214
million in cash and $5 billion in debt papers for Entel,
which has 3.2 million phone lines and 45,000 employees.
   The two companies pledged to pay an additional $379
million more within six years, and to invest several hundred
million dollars in the new enterprise.
   "This is a moment of triumph," said President Menem, who
has made privatizations the centerpiece of his efforts to
introduce free-market revisions to Argentina's
state-dominated economy.
