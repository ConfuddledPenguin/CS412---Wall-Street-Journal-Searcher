   Thirty-three years ago, the Soviet Union shook the West by
launching the world's first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit.
The event jarred Americans and galvanized the country's
resolve: Intent on not falling further behind the Russians,
the U.S. made science education a national mission and
pre-eminence in space a national goal.
   Today, some of the country's best minds think the U.S.
needs a new, similar spur to action -- but this time on the
economic front. For too long, they contend, the U.S. has
ignored critical problems that quietly threaten to undercut
its position as a world economic power. Now, some of them
say, the challenge from Japan may prove the Sputnik of the
1990s. "It's a kind of slow-motion Sputnik," says James
Powell, president of Reed College in Oregon. "It's there
beeping at you every time you turn on your VCR or load your
camera or turn on your fax machine."
   Already, a new wave of economic nationalism is spreading
across the U.S. It can be heard among the Nobel-prize winning
scientists at MIT and the cattle ranchers of Nebraska.
Americans worry that they are now locked into some inevitable
process of decline -- much like the economic downdraft that
has pulled at Britain for years.
   "You have to ask yourselves the same questions Brits asked
in the '60s," says Alan Bell, a British analyst at Baring
Securities in Tokyo. "As a Brit, you would get up in the
morning and brush your teeth with Colgate and use Palmolive
soap. You would drive a Ford to work for IBM and have Mars
bars for your snack during the day." Substitute Sony Walkmen,
Sanyo television sets and Toyota cars, and the story assumes
a disturbing relevance for the U.S.
   But as it demonstrated in the post-Sputnik era, the U.S.
has a unique talent for self-renewal. If harnessed by skilled
political leaders, the Japanese challenge could be used to
arouse a new sense of national purpose. Public opinion expert
Daniel Yankelovich even believes that a presidential
candidate with a clear analysis could make Japan and
competitiveness "the No. 1 issue in the 1992 campaign."
   What is to be done? What choices should business and
political leaders make?
   Not since World War II have the experts been so bitterly
divided. Some see Japan as an economic juggernaut, a "threat"
to be "contained." Others consider Japan as America's closest
ally and welcome the two countries' growing interdependence.
   Yet, amid the growing rancor, some common concerns about
U.S.-Japan relations have emerged. Japan is indeed a friend
and ally, but it also represents a challenge and perhaps even
a threat to the economic future of the U.S., given current
weaknesses in the American economy. Relations between the two
nations must remain close; but they will also be increasingly
troubled unless strong actions are taken on both sides of the
Pacific.
   Last week, the two nations reached an agreement aimed at
harmonizing their economic relationship. But, according to
the scores of interviews conducted for this series of
articles, much more will have to be done. Here are some of
the broad themes that promise to be at the core of future
debate.
                                                                                                       

   Economic nationalism can be a powerful tool to bring about
long-needed changes in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Many academics and some politicians deplore rising
economic nationalism, arguing that the world has become a
global village in which boundaries are less relevant. But
powerful feelings of American nationalism aren't about to go
away. If tapped, they can provide a source of the kind of
energy experts think is needed to match the Japanese economic
challenge.
   "If we decided, doggone it, we are sick to death of people
thinking the U.S. is in decline -- we could eat anybody's
lunch," says William Brock, a former labor secretary and U.S.
trade representative.
   There are dangers here, of course. If misused, economic
nationalism can lapse into ugly, even racist demagoguery in
which Japan becomes the "enemy." It can lead to "solutions"
that could in fact hurt both countries, such as measures to
block Japanese imports or restrict foreign investment. A
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed this
potentially destructive side of economic nationalism.
Eighty-six percent of those polled said they would rather
have a policy of slower growth in both countries than a
policy of faster growth in both countries if that meant
allowing Japan to take the lead.
   The challenge for American political leaders is to harness
economic nationalism and channel it, so it can be used to
make the U.S. stronger, not Japan weaker.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must save more and Japan less.
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese have more savings than they can productively
use in their own economy. Encouraged by government policies,
families set aside as much as 17% of their annual household
income. As a result, living standards in the country are
depressed and Japanese business has a wealth of money to
borrow and invest abroad. A lower savings rate in Japan could
spur living conditions there and potentially reduce
resentment abroad, where many economies are awash in Japanese
investment.
   Savings in the U.S. are another matter. For years,
Americans have been comparatively profligate, more inclined
to charge it than save it. Last year, Americans saved less
than 6% of their household income.
   As long as U.S. savings are low, investment from abroad --
notably Japan -- provides critical nourishment to the U.S.
economy, and any attempt to block it could cause substantial
damage. Nevertheless, America's dependence on foreign capital
is a potential problem for several reasons.
   First, anything from an earthquake in Tokyo to Japanese
dissatisfaction with U.S. policies could suddenly stop that
flow of cash, sending U.S. interest rates higher and possibly
touching off a recession. Second, the flow of interest,
dividends and profit earned by Japanese capital in the U.S.
is a drain on the living standards of future Americans. Many
people also worry that the one-way money flow will subtly
undermine the independence of the U.S.
   "I come from a small country -- Canada -- that's used to
foreign control," says Kenneth Courtis of DB Capital Markets.
"Foreign control basically means key strategic decisions are
made outside of your economy. The Belgians have learned to
live with that. I don't think you can live with it if you are
a superpower."
   Natural demographic trends will help correct the savings
imbalance in the future. American baby-boomers are only now
reaching their peak savings years, and the savings rate has
slowly started to rise. In addition, President Bush has
proposed a number of tax-related measures he says will
bolster savings, such as a tax-favored "family savings
account." In the meantime, a huge wave of Japanese will soon
reach retirement and begin to draw down their life savings.
   But economic studies suggest tax incentives provide only
modest encouragement to save, and the demographic trends by
themselves won't correct the remaining imbalance. For the
U.S., that leaves one way to raise the amount of savings
available for private investment: cut the federal budget
deficit, which is causing the government to borrow nearly
half the nation's paltry supply of savings.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. should encourage Japanese companies to act more
like other multinationals.
                                                                                                       

   Even if the savings imbalance were corrected, Japan's
multinational companies would continue spreading across the
globe, just as U.S. companies did in the 1950s and 1960s. But
unlike U.S. and European multinationals, Japanese companies
often don't hire locals for top management spots in their
overseas operations, nor do they give local suppliers the
same opportunities they accord suppliers back home.
   Until they do, Americans will rightfully view Japanese
investment as a mixed blessing. Moreover, business experts
say Japanese companies must dispel the notion that they are
agents of Japanese national policy -- that they are, for
instance, trying to keep the best jobs at home.
   John Stern, the American Electronics Association's vice
president in Tokyo, notes that European countries have used
hard-edged local-content legislation to "force Japanese
companies to behave like Europeans -- buy things on the local
market and promote local people." Yet that sort of effort can
be self-defeating, scaring away foreign investment and
promoting inefficiency. Still, the U.S. needs to find some
way to keep the pressure on Japanese business to conform to
world standards.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must renew its commitment to manufacturing.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. is lagging in its ability to get science out of
the laboratories and onto the factory floor. To compete with
Japan, new efforts must be made to to turn technological
breakthroughs into products.
   For the most part, that's a task for the private sector.
American companies have spent much of the 1980s in a whirl of
financial restructuring. Many corporate consultants believe
that, in the 1990s, executives will spend more time on the
shop floor and less with their investment bankers.
   There are signs this is already happening. Spurred by
competition from Japan, U.S. manufacturing productivity has
improved substantially in recent years. And many companies
are paying new attention to the fundamentals of their
business. One group of American companies has helped MIT set
up a new program called Leaders in Manufacturing. It unites
two divergent academic disciplines -- engineering and
business -- and is working with 11 major U.S. corporations to
train a corps of future corporate executives.
   "What we've got to do," explains Bill Hansen, vice
president for manufacturing at Digital Equipment Corp., "is
get our fair share of the best and the brightest going into
manufacturing corporations and the disciplines of
manufacturing."
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. education system is in need of an overhaul.
                                                                                                       

   From the vantage point of his campus, Mr. Powell of Reed
College is worried. The average Japanese high school senior
scores as well as the top 5% of American high school seniors
in math and science, he says. "If we don't fix this problem,
there is simply no way we can be a first-class power in the
21st century."
   Mr. Powell believes the problem may be partly cultural.
"America has never valued education as much as we should," he
says. "We pay teachers little and we ask schools to do
everything -- be babysitters, provide vocational training,
provide counseling. Our leaders ought to get out of the tanks
and flag factories and into the schools."
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must encourage Japan to make investment in that
country easier -- and American companies must work harder to
compete on Japan's turf.
                                                                                                       

   These days, Japan is the most demanding market for many
products. To reach world-class status American companies must
be able to compete there.
   Unfortunately, the easiest way to enter most foreign
markets -- acquiring a local company -- isn't easy in Japan.
Takeovers, by custom, are rare. And the stock of Japanese
companies is largely owned by other companies, creating an
interlocking network of business interests difficult for
foreign firms to penetrate. Changing that system won't be
easy. But the U.S. must encourage Japanese businesses and
government to find ways to allow foreign companies to get
into Japan's markets.
   In addition, American companies, on their own, must work
harder toward that goal. Companies with quality products and
aggressive marketing have proven it can be done.
   Motorola Inc., the Chicago-based maker of electronic
products, is an example. In the last 12 months alone, it has
recruited 150 Japanese employees, mostly engineers, by
cultivating college professors and handing out 500,000
"Motorola" textbook covers in college bookstores. It has
announced plans to open a second semiconductor factory in
Japan and it has sponsored twelve Chicago Symphony Orchestra
concerts throughout the country.
   "You have to use every tool in the book," says George
Fisher, Motorola's president and chief executive.
   In addition, in an effort to relearn the art of making
memory chips, a field the company had abandoned, Motorola has
entered into a cross-licensing agreement with Toshiba Inc.
"We're participating in the exporting of manufacturing
know-how back to the U.S.," says Rick Younts, president of
Nippon Motorola Ltd.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. government, too, should learn from Japan.
                                                                                                       

   Some people in the Bush administration virtually recoil at
the phrase "industrial policy." A powerful White House trio
-- Chief of Staff John Sununu, Budget Director Richard Darman
and Economic Adviser Michael Boskin -- have worked to boost
funding in basic research, but have quashed any effort to
promote any specific industry. Their fear is that government
efforts to encourage promising technologies could degenerate
into subsidies for companies with political clout.
   But in fact, the government already has an industrial
policy -- a hodgepodge of subsidies and tax breaks that have
provided an enormous boost to such industries as aerospace,
medical care and housing. What's needed now is for the
government to help American industry address a critical
business problem: making the leap from basic research to
commercial products. The U.S. needs to find new ways to
encourage investment in products for the future, even if that
investment doesn't produce short-term profits for companies.
                                                                                                       

   Americans must learn more about Japan as a country and
culture.
                                                                                                       

   Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, notes that
Japan sends 25,000 students a year to the U.S., while the
U.S. sends only 1,000 to Japan. Chalmers Johnson, a Japan
specialist at the University of California, contends: "We
need infinitely more people who can read Japanese."
   Thomas Rohlen, who heads up the Stanford Japan Center in
Kyoto, is helping Americans learn about Japan. His program,
which educates American engineers, businessmen and others, is
run out of a gleaming building with its own Zen rock garden.
He recently scored a small victory when two of his charges,
both undergraduates, used Japanese to secure a small contract
to export American products to Japan.
   The Japan Science and Technology Program at MIT is also
helping change the trend. It sent 43 post-graduate engineers
and scientists to Japan last year for stints in Japanese
laboratories. "We're putting Japan into the bloodstream of
the best and brightest career scientists," says Richard
Samuels, the program's director.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must forge a new partnership with Japan in
foreign policy.
                                                                                                       

   Secretary of State James Baker calls it a new "global
partnership" with Japan. But so far, the "partnership"
strikes many Japanese as one-sided. They see the U.S.
devising its own policies, then asking Japan to pay for them.
One example: when the U.S. developed a Third World debt plan
and then asked the Japanese to cough up several billion
dollars to help foot the bill. Given their growing power and
national pride, the Japanese aren't likely to accept such an
arrangement for long.
   "Adjustments are needed on both sides," says Takakazu
Kuriyama, Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs. "The U.S.
has to adjust itself to a new position in the world where you
are no longer the dominant power, but still the leading power
among industrial democracies. And Japan has to learn to
adjust itself to a new status as a major industrialized
nation."
   Thirty years ago this summer, the U.S. and Japan revised
the security treaty that has been the linchpin of their
relationship ever since. The revision was meant to put the
two on a more equal footing, but in the world of 1960 there
was no question that the U.S. was overwhelmingly the world's
economic power.
   Today the two countries are on a more nearly equal
economic footing. No matter how successfully the U.S. deals
with its economic problems, it is unlikely to regain the
position it held for much of the 45 years since World War II.
At the same time, the superpower tensions that helped shape
the U.S.-Japan partnership are easing.
   The world order will have to change to reflect these new
realities. What will that world order look like?
   Over dinner at a French restaurant in Tokyo, Takashi and
Kuniko Inoguchi hold forth on that question. The married
couple are among Japan's political science elite. He is 46
years old and a political scientist at Tokyo University; she
is 37, a professor at Sophia University and a popular
television commentator. He has his doctorate from MIT, she
from Yale, and both belong to Japan's small but growing group
of internationalists.
   They foresee four possible paths for the U.S. and Japan.
   The first is a revival of American dominance, "Pax
Americana," which they consider unlikely. The second they
call "Pax Nipponica," which would have Japan becoming the
leader of the free world. That's equally unlikely, concludes
Mrs. Inoguchi. "What makes a hegemonic power? You have to
have legitimacy," she says. "On this point Japan is very
weak. We have the debt of history."
   The third option they call "bigemony" -- the U.S. and
Japan sharing power. But that, too, has problems. "It
wouldn't be acceptable to Europe or Asia," says Mrs.
Inoguchi.
   That leaves the fourth option -- Pax Consortia, a world no
longer run by a dominant power, but by a coalition of leading
powers. "It is very difficult to manage," says Mr. Inoguchi,
shaking his head.
   But his wife is unequivocal: "It's the only possible
alternative."
   The world of the future will require the cooperation of a
number of major economic powers. The U.S. and Japan, as the
two largest single economies in that coalition, will hold the
key to its success.

   As the pace of Japan's direct investment in the U.S.
accelerated in the 1980s, many Americans feared a loss of
control over their own destiny and a growing dependence on
Japan.
