   TOKYO -- Japan's demand for one-megabit dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chips will grow 28.7% in the second half
of this year, from the previous six months, to about 277.50
million units, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) predicted Friday.
   MITI officials noted that demand is shifting increasingly
to one-megabit computer chips, the most sophisticated now on
the market, from 256-kilobit chips.

   Demand for a variety of semiconductors, which languished
early this year, will rebound in the second half as the
result of a recovery in demand for computers and other office
automation equipment, according to officials.
   But as the shift in demand progresses, they said, demand
for 256-kilobit chips will decline 9.1% between July and
December, from the prior six months, to 139.50 million units.
