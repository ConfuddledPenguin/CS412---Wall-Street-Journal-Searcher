   NEW YORK -- When it comes to investing, how much risk can
you stomach?
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. wants to know.

   In coming weeks, the nation's biggest brokerage firm will
begin asking the individual investors behind its 7.2 million
retail accounts to decide for themselves just how aggressive
they're really willing to be in buying stocks, bonds and
other investments.
   With the new setup, individual investors will be asked to
put themselves in one of four risk categories: "conservative
for income," "conservative for growth," "moderate risk" and
"aggressive risk." Each category will have its own
recommended asset allocation, or investment mix.
   Merrill Lynch isn't the only securities firm that wants
investors to state more explicitly how willing they are to
risk losing money in the pursuit of profit. Earlier this
year, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., General Electric Co.'s brokerage
unit, adopted a five-category asset-allocation model. Some
other brokerage firms say they're looking at such setups,
too.
   Getting investors to pigeonhole themselves in this way can
be a good thing because it forces them to come to grips with
their feelings about risk. And it gives their stock brokers
formal written notice about these desires. The customer's
choice "goes into the record," says George Grune, managing
director of Kidder Peabody's asset management group.
   At the same time, getting investors on record about their
risk tolerances is likely to make it easier for a brokerage
firm to defend itself if it gets hit with lawsuits or
arbitration claims by investors who don't like what their
brokers are doing.
   An investor who picks the "aggressive risk" category, for
example, is agreeing to "move aggressively among asset
classes" and deal in "speculative and high-risk issues,"
according to guidelines distributed to Merrill Lynch brokers
last week. Such an investor might have a difficult time
claiming that his or her broker was too aggressive.
   Legal issues like that are a growing concern on Wall
Street. Over the past year, brokerage firms have been forced
to pay increasingly stiff punitive-damage awards in
arbitration cases brought by disgruntled investors.
   Brokers are required by securities law to make sure
customers are put into "suitable" investments. Unsuitability
lawsuits are brought when it's alleged that a broker knew, or
should have known, that an investment wasn't consistent with
a client's investment objectives.
   Merrill Lynch officials stress that such legal concerns
aren't the main reason for the new system, although they
don't deny they are a factor. The officials say they mainly
wanted to be more "flexible" with the firm's asset-allocation
recommendations, tailoring the research department's advice
on the markets to an investor's general profile.
   Avoiding customer disputes is "one of the side benefits,
but that's not why it was created in the first place," says
John Steffens, president of Merrill Lynch's
individual-investor operations. "`The Street,' in my view, in
general has dealt with this whole asset-allocation subject a
little bit too simplistically," he says.
   Sam Scott Miller, a New York securities lawyer, says
getting investors to segment themselves according to risk
preferences is a "sound and prudent approach" to heading off
legal disputes, providing the firms monitor the systems well.
Not only should it protect the firm in disputes with
customers, it might also be an early warning to a securities
firm if one of its brokers is pushing customers into
unsuitable investments. If a certain broker "brings in all
`aggressive' accounts, they're going to want to take a look
at it," he says.
   Some of Merrill Lynch's competitors have less-formal ways
of tailoring asset-allocation recommendations. Firms
including St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. and
Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc., St. Petersburg, Fla.,
already have more than one asset-allocation model for
different investor profiles. But they don't ask investors to
commit formally to one or the other.
   "There is a temptation with asset allocation to put the
retail client into a profile," says Raymond Worseck,
investment strategy coordinator at A.G. Edwards, which has
decided not to institute a formal system like Merrill
Lynch's. Such a system has "compliance pluses" for brokerage
firms, "because it protects them legally from a risk
standpoint." But the investor can sometimes be better served
with a more personalized approach, he says.
   Merrill Lynch emphasizes that getting investors to specify
their risk tolerance is only a beginning for grooming an
investor's portfolio. Once an investor picks a risk category,
the broker uses computer models and other tools to build a
portfolio of appropriate stocks and bonds. Investors can
switch risk categories, but frequent switching isn't
encouraged, Merrill Lynch officials say.
   Charles Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief investment
strategist, says he realizes there are critics of his firm's
plan. "You could say a multitude of asset guidelines just
adds to the confusion of the issue," he says. But Mr. Clough
adds that having the set categories helps to organize
investors whose risk profiles otherwise would be "all over
the map."
   (On Friday, Mr. Clough said that Merrill Lynch's benchmark
asset-allocation -- for a large balanced corporate pension
fund or endowment -- would be shifted a bit toward stocks
effective today: 50% stocks, 45% bonds and the rest cash,
instead of 45% stocks and 50% bonds. Mr. Clough said the
shift didn't represent a major policy change by bond-bullish
Merrill Lynch, but only an "adjustment because bonds have had
a good rally" and stocks have declined recently. The
weightings of the four new individual-investor categories
weren't changed.)
