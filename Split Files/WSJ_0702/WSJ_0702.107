   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. has held talks with
Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. about a leveraged buy-out of the
electronic components company valued at more than $1.1
billion, according to people familiar with the talks.
   Off-and-on negotiations between the company and Forstmann,
which are both based here, have apparently heated up again in
recent days. Barring some last-minute snag, an announcement
of some transaction could occur this week.

   General Instrument had about 27.5 million shares
outstanding as of late last year. Its stock closed at $36.25
a share, up 50 cents, in composite trading Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. A $1.1 billion buy-out would equal $40 a
share, but the actual price could well be higher.
   A spokesman for General Instrument, reached at the company
offices yesterday, said, "It is company policy not to comment
on rumor or speculation." He wouldn't elaborate. Forstmann's
chief strategist, Theodore Forstmann, couldn't be reached for
comment.
   General Instrument is best-known for making cable TV
equipment, particularly boxes that process and scramble
signals, as well as semiconductors and wagering systems for
race tracks. In its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, it earned
$98.7 million, or $3.27 a share, on revenue of $1.38 billion.
   General Instrument's stock had been under pressure earlier
this year because of concerns about government regulation of
the cable TV business, and because of the delay of a large
order for cable TV equipment. Its chairman and chief
executive officer is Frank G. Hickey.
   Forstmann, Little is one of the few leveraged buy-out
firms that has been aggressively seeking to do large buy-outs
despite the collapse of the market for high-risk, high-yield
"junk" bonds, which usually help finance such buy-outs.
   That's because Forstmann has its own fund of subordinated
debt, contributed by the same investors who provide the
equity for the leveraged acquisitions. That subordinated debt
fund substitutes for junk bonds in most Forstmann buy-outs.
   Earlier this year, Forstmann exploited this financing
capability by negotiating an $825 million acquisition of the
Gulfstream business jet aircraft manufacturer from Chrysler
Corp., which wanted to leave the airplane market.
   The Gulfstream purchase involved only bank debt and both
equity and subordinated debt from Forstmann investors. Mr.
Forstmann has been a consistent critic of junk bonds, warning
that they endangered the financial health of companies that
used them.
   If the Forstmann talks do result in a buy-out proposal,
General Instrument would be one of only a few major publicly
held corporations whose management attempted a buy-out since
the bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., subsequently completed in early
1989 by another group at a price of $25 billion. Since then,
many top executives have been wary of possible criticism that
they could profit from a buy-out at shareholders' expense.
   A possible buy-out bid could always be topped by another
corporation interested in General Instrument for strategic
reasons. But because of the weakness of the junk-bond market,
there is less likely to be competition from other buy-out
funds.
