   Ratners Group PLC, an aggressively expanding British
jewelry chain, is expected to make a friendly offer for
troubled Kay Jewelers Inc., a jewelry chain with nearly 500
stores nationwide.
   Officials at Kay and at Ratners's investment bank declined
to comment on London newspaper reports that an agreement will
be announced soon. "Right now, I can't comment on it," said
Roldan Fernandez, Kay's chief financial officer. Bob Dowsett,
an investment banker at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, a Ratners
takeover adviser, said the investment bank had "no comment"
on the acquisition reports. "I think it would be pretty
unusual for a British company to comment like that on a
Sunday," said Mr. Dowsett.

   Ratners was prepared to pay as much as $200 million and
assume a roughly equal amount in debt, according to London
newspapers. Kay's stock closed at $10.875 a share, up 50
cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday. At that price, the company's common outstanding have
a value of about $135.4 million.
   Kay, based in Alexandria, Va., is one of the nation's
biggest sellers of fine jewelry, including diamonds, gold
jewelry and watches. In addition to Kay Jewelers stores, the
company operates the upscale Black, Starr &amp; Frost chain; J.B.
Robinson, concentrated in the Midwest, and Marcus &amp; Co., an
operator of jewelry departments in major stores. Kay's
concentration has been the middle market with most of its
stores in suburban and regional shopping malls. Last year,
battered by competitors' aggressive discounting and a heavy
debt load, its profits sank to $196,000 from nearly $11
million on revenue of $426.6 million.
   Kay, which has been built rapidly on debt, experienced a
credit crunch this spring. Between mid-March and mid-May,
four of Kay's lenders pulled about $16.5 million in credit
lines and three of them sought to withdraw $32 million more.
Last week, Kay announced that it arranged an $80 million
revolving credit agreement to meet working capital needs
through January, and it said the three banks were
participating. The agreement replaced an $86 million line of
credit. Kay also said that three directors invested $5
million in the company and planned to invest another $5
million later this year.
   Ratners, which owns the Sterling Inc. jewelry chain with
about 360 stores in the U.S., has long been mentioned as a
possible suitor for Kay. But Kay's junk bonds, totaling about
$150 million, have been a deterrent.
   Ratners has eagerly sought a U.S. acquisition since last
year, when talks to acquire the Gordons jewelry chain broke
down, according to British analysts. (Gordons was purchased
by Zale Corp., a unit of Peoples Jewellers Ltd. of Canada.)
Ratners management has told analysts it wants to expand its
U.S. operation to 1,500 stores and a 10% share of America's
$12 billion jewelry market, dominated by local chains and
individual outlets.
   For Ratners, the U.S. investment would mark a huge
expansion at a time many British retailers are reeling from
Britain's high-interest rate, inflation-ridden economy.
Ratners would be following a high-risk strategy because some
British marketers have found it difficult to bring their
style of so-called high-street, or main street, retailing to
American shopping centers and malls.
