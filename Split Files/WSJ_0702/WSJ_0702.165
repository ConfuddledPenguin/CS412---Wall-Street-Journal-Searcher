   TULSA, Okla. -- C.I.S. Technologies Inc. said its majority
shareholder, Swiss Reinsurance Co. of Zurich, Switzerland,
plans to sell its 53% stake in the company.
   C.I.S., which manages insurance claims for the hospital
industry, said Swiss Reinsurance's decision wasn't related to
C.I.S.'s performance, but was a "strategic decision." C.I.S.
said it will support the holder's efforts, but added that it
intends to remain independent.
