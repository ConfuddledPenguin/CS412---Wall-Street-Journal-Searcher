   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
lowered its rating of Chrysler Corp. debt to Moody's lowest
investment grade level. The move affects $22.28 billion of
debt.
   The move follows a downgrading of Chrysler debt ratings by
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. two weeks ago. "This isn't the first
shot out of the barrel," a Chrysler spokesman said.

   Moody's said its move reflects an assessment that Chrysler
will have less "financial flexibility" in the future. Moody's
said the auto maker is likely to have weaker earnings and
cash flow while incurring large capital and
product-development expenditures. Chrysler's first-quarter
earnings fell 80% to $71 million, or 32 cents a share, from a
year earlier.
   Moody's made its announcement after the stock market
closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Chrysler closed unchanged at $15.75.
   In a statement, Chrysler said that it was "deeply
disappointed" with the downgrading and that the Moody's
decision was "not warranted by the facts." The company said
it was ironic that Moody's would criticize its aggressive
product development plans because U.S. corporations for years
have been criticized for taking the short-term view.
   The action pushed Chrysler's senior debt rating down one
notch above speculative grade. Moody's downgraded ratings on
Chrysler senior debt and its shelf registration to Baa-3 from
Baa-2. Moody's handed out an identical downgrading to the
ratings on senior debt of Chrysler Financial Corp., the
company's finance unit and currently its chief profit center.
   Chrysler criticized the downgrading of its financial
unit's commercial paper. Chrysler Financial has a "continuing
record of profitability, and the highest level of cash and
marketable securities in the corporation's history," the
company said.
   The finance unit, which is responsible for $18 billion of
the $22.28 billion of debt affected by the ratings move, has
posted record earnings for six consecutive years. Chrysler
officials are predicting record second-quarter earnings for
the unit.
