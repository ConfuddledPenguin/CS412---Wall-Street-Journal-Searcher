   CHICAGO -- Stone Container Corp. said it sold 160,000
acres of timberland in Florida for $65 million. The company
didn't disclose the buyer.
   The paperboard and paper packaging products concern said
the acreage sold is the last major part of the 334,000 acres
of timberland taken over as part of its acquisition of
Southwest Forest Industries Inc. in April 1987. Stone
Container said it still owns 350,000 acres of timberland,
primarily in Canada.

   Stone Container said the proceeds from the sale will be
