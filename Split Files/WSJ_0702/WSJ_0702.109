   T&amp;N PLC said it extended the expiration date of its tender
offer to buy all the common stock of J.P. Industries Inc., an
Ann Arbor, Mich., automotive engine-parts maker, after
regulators requested additional time.
   T&amp;N, a U.K. equipment manufacturer, began its tender offer
in April, after J.P. Industries agreed to be acquired by T&amp;N
for $190 million, or $17.30 a share, plus assumption of $185
million of debt.

   The companies said the Federal Trade Commission requested
more time to complete its analysis of information submitted
by the companies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law.
The FTC also requested an earlier extension in May, after
requesting additional information.
   T&amp;N said it will extend the offer until July 13. The offer
had been scheduled to expire on Tuesday. As of this past
Wednesday, shareholders had tendered 6,274,359 shares, or
nearly 60% of the shares outstanding.
