   Where does the small investor go
   When the market sharply declines?
   Once the stocks reach their bottom,
   He moves to the sidelines.
   And there he prudently stays
   Through each daily groan and creak,
   And then boldly rushes in
   As the market reaches peak.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Our hale-and-hearty weekend athletes,
   In their tough workouts never shirk,
   Knowing after the sweating and straining,
   There'll be five days to relax at work.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.
