   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc., the former real
estate syndicator operating under bankruptcy court
protection, is informally circulating a reorganization plan
to its creditors.
   Although details of the plan are still being negotiated,
officials and creditors say Integrated envisions a three-step
process whereby creditors initially would share between $300
million and $350 million in cash raised largely through asset
sales. The company currently has more than $200 million in
cash in escrow.

   Integrated, which largely manages more than 600
partnerships, then would segregate its contract rights to
manage those partnerships and issue notes against them.
Integrated estimates the contract rights at about $200
million; the company would seek to sell the rights over a
three-year period and then distribute proceeds to creditors.
   Creditors also would share an equity interest in the
remaining company, which would specialize in hotel management
and equipment leasing. Officials estimate that business to be
valued at about $200 million. The company already has been
scaling back its operating expenses and expects substantial
reductions by year end. More staff reductions were made
Friday, and officials expect the number of employees to be
reduced from the current 500 to about 275 by year end.
   The plan hasn't been widely distributed to creditors, who
are owed a total of about $1.8 billion. Those who have seen
the plan are expected to respond to Integrated next week.
Creditors seem generally satisfied about the speed with which
the case is proceeding. Integrated entered bankruptcy
proceedings in February; the federal Bankruptcy Court
directed Integrated to submit a disclosure statement to
creditors that should provide terms of the reorganization by
July 26. Integrated's "exclusivity period," the time period
in which only it can officially propose a reorganization plan
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, expires
Sept. 11.
   Both Integrated officials and creditors view the
resolution of issues among various creditor groups as the
next big hurdle the company has to surmount in fashioning a
plan. Although the overall plan has been set out, it isn't
clear how the cash, notes and equity ultimately will be
distributed among creditors.
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman and chief
executive officer, has said senior creditors, who are owed a
total of about $1 billion, probably would receive about 45
cents to 50 cents on the dollar. It's unclear what junior
creditors, who are owed about $600 million, might receive,
but it would be "substantially less" than what senior
creditors can expect. There are about $200 million in general
unsecured claims.
