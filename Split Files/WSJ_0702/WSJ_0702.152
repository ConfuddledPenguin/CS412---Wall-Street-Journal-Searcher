   Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., San Franisco, said a federal judge
enjoined it from distributing its new video Game Genie,
acting in a copyright infringement suit brought by Nintendo
of America Inc., based in Redmond, Washington.
   Galoob said the decision by Judge Robert H. Schnacke of
the San Francisco U.S. District Court affects its planned
distribution of the product this month, and will be appealed
immediately.

   Nintendo said Judge Schnacke ruled that Galoob's Game
Genie operated on "derivative" audio-visual works that
infringed on Nintendo's copyrights.
   Galoob, which markets and distributes a variety of toy
products world-wide, bills the game as the world's only
"video game enchancer." The video product allows players to
modify games on Nintendo's popular home-entertainment system.
   Nintendo has filed more than 50 suits against individuals
and companies in recent years over copyright issues.
