   German businessman Jurgen Hippenstiel-Imhausen got what he
deserved -- a five-year prison term for crimes revolving
around the delivery to Libya of materials for a plant capable
of producing lethal chemical weapons. Most of the sentence
was for tax evasion, but the case sends a warning signal to
other potential Western suppliers of poison-gas technology.
   The case reflects a disturbing increase in attempts by
some nations to secure chemical and biological warfare (CBW)
capabilities. The Cold War is thawing, or so it seems, but
there still are plenty of potential aggressors in the world
who want to intimidate their neighbors. One means is cheap,
accessible and easily camouflaged: poison gas.

   Chemical weapons have been around for a long time.
Biological weapons, potentially more lethal and harder to
protect against, have come along more recently. Over the past
decade, we have cited many times on these pages the evidence
of the use of "yellow rain," most likely a Soviet-produced
biological toxin, by the Laotian and Vietnamese governments
against Hmong rebels in Laos. There also is evidence that the
Soviets used CBW briefly in the early stages of the Afghan
war. Iraq's use of poison gas against Iranian soldiers at one
point in the Iraq-Iran war and more recently against Kurdish
rebel forces were well-documented cases. In his interview
with the Journal's Karen Elliot House (excerpted nearby),
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expressed his willingness to
use his CBW inventories against Israel if provoked (see
related story: "On the Record: Iraq Weighs Threat of War" --
WSJ July 2, 1990).
   There also is the risk of these deadly agents falling into
terrorist hands or being used by a national leader against
populated areas as a mad gesture of defiance. Acquisitions of
CBW agents are accompanied by intensified efforts to obtain
ballistic missile technologies, which greatly expand the area
a potential aggressor can threaten. More than a dozen
less-developed countries have chemical weapons and ballistic
missiles, according to U.S. and Soviet sources.
   Caging the chemical weapon is even trickier than
containing the nuclear one. Chemical technology is relatively
simple and doesn't pose the radiation dangers inherent in
nuclear processing. Production is easy to disguise through
claims that a plant is making herbicides, insecticides or
fertilizers.
   Plugs for the proliferation bottle have proved leaky.
Negotiations for a full international convention have been in
process since 1969, and continue in Geneva. But the
impossibility of verifying compliance casts doubt on these
and other such efforts.
   One thing that the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case makes clear,
however, is that it is too early to abandon Western controls,
mostly under COCOM, on the export of weapons technology.
Prosecution might have been harder had the German
manufacturer not violated German export control laws in
addition to his tax-law infringements. Responsible chemical
companies could perhaps further control efforts, and possibly
head off intrusive regulation, by setting up voluntary
inspection programs. Strengthened controls on missile
technology might help as well, although the difficulty of
stopping countries such as China from exporting rockets has
become evident.
   Because of the verification problem, but also because of
languor, the Western alliance has been slow to acknowledge
and try to deal with CBW proliferation. There has been
insufficient recognition of the fact that modern technology
can make small aggressors lethal enough to be taken
seriously. We hope the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case reflects an
improved recognition of the threat.
