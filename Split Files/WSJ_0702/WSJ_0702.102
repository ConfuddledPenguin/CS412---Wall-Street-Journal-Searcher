   NEW YORK -- Prospect Group Inc. shareholders will receive
equity in an odd potpourri of several businesses as part of
the company's pending liquidation.
   Altogether, Prospect shareholders will receive interests
in eight companies, ranging from a railroad-holding company
and a mushroom producer to a distributor of Swiss Army
Knives. But because some of the companies aren't public, the
exact value of the assortment isn't yet clear.

   "This was a difficult company to understand," a spokesman
declared, explaining in part why Prospect chose to break up
the unusual conglomerate. For some time, officials have
maintained that the stock market didn't recognize the
underlying value of Prospect's various assets.
   Because "several assets don't have a public market, their
value isn't readily apparent," said Michael Millman, analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "Until the liquidation, the
shareholders didn't know how they would directly and
specifically benefit from the operations."
   Mr. Millman gives management high marks, however, for
building Prospect's group of businesses. "The negative of the
liquidation is that shareholders can't participate" any
longer with Prospect's investment managers, the analyst said.
   Prospect went public in May 1986 at $9.75 a share;
shareholders approved the liquidation plan Wednesday at the
annual meeting here. Of the 22 million shares eligible to
vote on the liquidation plan, 18 million voted and more than
90% of those approved the transaction. In national
over-the-counter trading Friday, its shares closed at
$17.625, down 12.5 cents.
   Terms of the liquidation require Prospect's managers to
distribute its assets within three years. If some assets
remain after that time, they will be placed in a trust and
distributed by the trustees.
   Earlier this year, Prospect holders received one share of
Illinois Central Corp. for each two Prospect shares, a total
of 62% of the Chicago freight-railroad holding company. A few
shares were held for stock-option programs for Prospect
executives who also held directorships at Illinois Central.
   The Illinois Central stock will trade in tandem with
Prospect's until the railroad's shares receive a separate
over-the-counter listing. Prospect's spokesman expects the
railroad's shares to begin trading separately in August or
September.
   In the liquidation, Prospect also will convert its small
preferred-stock holding of MidSouth Corp., a Jackson, Miss.,
freight railroad, to common stock, and holders will receive
those shares. In 1987, Prospect distributed its MidSouth
common shareholdings; the new allocation will give Prospect
holders substantially all MidSouth's common. In national
over-the-counter trading Friday, MidSouth shares fell 25
cents to $8.75.
   Prospect shareholders also will get stakes in:
   -- Sylvan Foods Holdings Inc. Prospect's holders will
receive one share of the Worthington, Pa., mushroom producer
for about each 10 of their shares. Prospect will seek an OTC
listing for Sylvan's shares.
   -- Children's Discovery Centers of America Inc. Prospect
holders will receive a 1-for-10 distribution, or a total of
50%, of the San Rafael, Calif., operator of childcare
centers. CDCA last traded over the counter Wednesday and was
quoted at $3 bid.
   -- Forschner Group Inc. Prospect holders will receive a
1-for-10 distribution, equal to a total of 58%, of the
exclusive U.S. distributor of the Swiss Army Knife. Based in
Shelton, Conn., Forschner trades national OTC; the shares
closed Friday at $11, down 25 cents.
   -- Ivy Insurance Group Inc. Prospect wholly owns this
Pasadena, Calif., auto-insurance company and is seeking to
sell it. Prospect, which bought it in July 1988 from Kemper
Corp. of Chicago, may have a problem selling this unit
because in November 1988, California's voters radically
tightened the laws regulating property/casualty insurers.
   Sometime in the future, Prospect will distribute holdings
in:
   -- Recognition Equipment Inc., a Dallas manufacturer of
document-processing equipment. Prospect holds 1,431,800
shares and a $15 million 10% senior subordinated note
convertible into 1,666,667 shares. Prospect "believes
Recognition is trading at a depressed value and is a
turnaround situation," the company's spokesman said. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, the company's
shares rose 50 cents, to $5.50.
   -- Noel Group Inc., a New York natural-resources and
energy company. Prospect holds 1,909,090 shares, a 19% stake,
plus one million more that it will receive when Noel Group
exercises an option to buy Wood River Capital Corp., a New
York small-business investment company, from Prospect. Noel
Group is controlled by Louis Marx Jr. of New York, who until
Jan. 19, 1990, was chairman of the Prospect board's asset
committee. Noel is expected to go public in the next two or
three years, Prospect's spokesman said.
   Prospect had an about 60% interest in National Spirit
Group Inc., a Dallas operator of cheerleader camps, and in
February definitively agreed to sell it to BSN Corp. for $40
million. The deal fell through in April, however, and later
that month, National Spirit Group filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
