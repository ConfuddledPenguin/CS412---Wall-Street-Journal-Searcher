   Admit it, frequent fliers. You tune out when the pilot
tunes in to give his customary spiel to passengers.
   But then, you've probably never been aboard Capt. Michael
Berry's flights. The Pan Am pilot's announcements are, well,
different. His motto: "Flying is serious business, but it
doesn't have to be dull."

   The 28-year veteran flies mostly out of New York's John F.
Kennedy Airport. Given the usual delays there, his
unsuspecting passengers probably don't think too much of it
when he briefs them on the time of their "escape from New
York."
   But, when the seat-belt sign is turned off, the tall,
husky pilot turns on. He reminds passengers they are free to
walk about. "As a matter of fact, if you feel an overwhelming
urge to disco dance in the aisles, you may now do so," he
adds, in his lush Louisiana drawl.
   En route updates go something like this: "Well, we're
passing directly over the Piggly Wiggly supermarket in
downtown St. John's, Newfoundland. . . ."
   "I've put Piggly Wigglys everywhere," says the 50-year-old
pilot. But once, over the Caribbean, he announced the flight
was "180 miles due west of the Piggly Wiggly located on the
island of Bermuda." A passenger, who took him too seriously,
later told him Bermuda's only Piggly Wiggly had become a
Safeway. Now he uses "the Snappy Shine Car Wash."
   Over Washington, D.C., he told passengers some heavy
turbulence was being caused by "thermal variations in the
atmosphere -- a fancy term for hot air rising." Then he
added: "As you might expect, hot air is always a problem in
the Washington area." A flight attendant sent the item to
Reader's Digest, which paid her $300 to publish it.
   His Pan Am Shuttle passengers get this Capt. Kirk-ish
welcome: "These are the voyages of Pan Am Clipper Ship First
Prize. Its one-hour mission: to explore a strange new world.
To boldly go where only this group of carbon-based
terrestrials wanted to go this hour -- the Big Apple."
   Elaine Copland, a New York travel agent, found Capt.
Berry's approach "a very welcome change" during a flight from
Europe. Passengers applauded when the pilot emerged from the
cockpit.
   The flight had arrived early, and Capt. Berry apologized
that "there can be no refund for flying less time than
scheduled." Then he gave his trademark farewell: "Ladies and
gentlemen, you're on your own again. Let's be careful out
there."
