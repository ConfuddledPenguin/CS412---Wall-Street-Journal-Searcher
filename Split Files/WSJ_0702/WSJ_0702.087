   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. sold 155 failed
savings and loan associations in the second quarter,
exceeding the agency's target, but the RTC blew a hole in the
federal budget to do it.
   The swift sales of the thrifts, which held nearly $50
billion in assets, were a big morale boost for the S&amp;L
bailout agency, which began from scratch 10 months ago. It
sold just 55 thrifts during the first seven months of the S&amp;L
cleanup.

   But the $45 billion in cash required by the RTC for the
sales in the latest quarter helped spur the budget
negotiations between the White House and Congress, and were a
factor in President Bush's conceding that a tax increase is
necessary to reduce the budget deficit.
   The RTC will run out of cash some time after October, the
agency said, and unless the budget summit clears the way for
more funding, the agency will have to delay further sales of
insolvent thrifts. A Treasury official last week said the
Bush administration is depending on the budget negotiators to
devise a funding plan. "Beyond that, we have no Plan B," he
said.
   The transactions Friday included the sale of CenTrust
Savings Bank, Miami, a thrift made famous by the excesses of
its chairman, David Paul. CenTrust was acquired by Great
Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., in a
transaction requiring a record $1.7 billion of assistance. In
addition, units of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles,
purchased Gibraltar Savings of Simi Valley, Calif., and the
Washington state offices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle.
   The RTC estimates it will save nearly $200 million this
year in operating and funding costs related to the
institutions it sold this past quarter. "This accomplishment
puts us on schedule and allows the RTC to move forward with
our original operating plan of completing 50 to 75
resolutions a quarter," said RTC Chairman William Seidman.
   The S&amp;L industry's losses result from the bad investments
that institutions made, using federally insured deposits. In
the deals so far, the RTC estimates that it transferred or
sold about half of those assets to buyers. But many of those
transactions include terms that allow the buyers to return
the assets to the government if the buyer finds fraud or
underwriting problems.
   The industrywide cleanup, including interest, will cost
upward of $300 billion over 10 years. Including Friday's
flurry of deals, the RTC has completed transactions covering
207 failed thrifts. A spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. estimated the losses of those transactions at
$26 billion, based on preliminary data.
   The transactions Friday included:
                                                                                                       

   -- Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan Association, a Simi Valley
thrift with $6.7 billion in assets, was sold to Security
Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles. Security Pacific will
assume all deposits and some secured liabilities, totaling
$5.5 billion, and agreed to purchase $5.3 billion of the
failed thrift's assets. The RTC estimates the transaction
will ultimately cost the government $521.6 million.
   -- Security Pacific Bank Washington bought the Washington
offices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle. Gibraltar's Florida
branches were purchased by Great Western Bank, a unit of
Great Western Financial. The acquirers will assume deposits
totaling $1.2 billion. The RTC's ultimate cost was put at
$106.1 million.
   -- First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Colorado
Springs, Colo., with $281.9 million in assets, was acquired
by Western National Bank of Colorado Springs, in a
transaction expected to cost the RTC $138 million.
   -- Elysian Federal Savings Bank, Hoboken, N.J., with
$114.3 million in assets, was sold to Pamrapo Savings Bank,
Bayonne, N.J., in a deal expected to cost the RTC $33.5
million.
   -- Valley Federal Savings Association, McAllen, Texas,
with $536 million in assets, was sold to International Bank
of Commerce, Laredo, Texas, in a transaction expected to cost
the RTC $210 million.
   -- The RTC placed Windsor Federal Savings Association,
Austin, Texas, into receivership. Windsor Savings had about
$121.6 million in assets.
   Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. permitted
South Boston Savings Bank, Boston, to assume the deposits of
Eliot Savings Bank, Boston, with $450 million in assets. The
FDIC will advance $363 million to South Boston to the buyer
for the transaction.
