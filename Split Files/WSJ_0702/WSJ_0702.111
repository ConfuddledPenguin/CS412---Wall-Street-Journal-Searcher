   WASHINGTON -- The American middle class was squeezed
during the 1980s, while the rich prospered, according to an
analysis by influential House liberals that previews the
coming debate in Congress over what taxes to raise.
   "They {the middle class} didn't come to the party," the
Democratic Study Group concluded in a report prepared for
release today. "Don't send them the bill."

   With President Bush's "no new taxes" pledge now history,
many Democrats are focusing more on the nature of the taxes
to be increased as part of a deficit-reduction compromise.
The DSG last week released a letter signed by 134 members of
Congress who vowed to oppose any compromise that adds to the
tax burden on working- and middle-class families rather than
the very wealthy.
   The Bush administration and many congressional Republicans
are talking about higher consumption taxes of various kinds
-- for instance, on cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, energy.
They oppose raising income-tax rates on upper-income
taxpayers. With President Bush determined to cut the
capital-gains tax, which would benefit upper-income
taxpayers, Democrats are resolved to offset that by raising
some other taxes paid by those same people.
   "People who should pay are the ones who benefited from the
Reagan party," Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said last week.
   On NBC News' "Meet the Press" yesterday, New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo said any tax changes should balance the tax
burden. "This isn't a question of sacrificing the rich, it's
getting the rich to catch up with the middle class and the
poor," said Mr. Cuomo. "You've already taxed {the poor and
middle class} by cutting off the states, by forcing us to tax
gasoline, real estate, sales taxes. That's the poor people,
that's the middle class that get hit disproportionately."
   The DSG report notes, as other analysts have, that wages
failed to keep pace with inflation during the 1980s. Because
more and more women went to work, inflation-adjusted median
family income did rise, though.
   But, the DSG argues, families that sent second
wage-earners to work may not have seen their standard of
living rise. "A family which requires two earnings is less
well off than a one-earner family with the same income," it
argues.
   Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data gathered during
the early 1980s, the group says child-care and other
work-related expenses consume between 20% and 30% of the
added income. As a result, the net contribution of second
earners wasn't sufficient to offset fully the general decline
in wage levels, the group said.
   Two-earner families saved less and were slightly less
likely to own a home than single-earner families with the
same family income, the DSG said.
