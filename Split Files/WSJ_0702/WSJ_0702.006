   WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a
man with a mission: In case after case, he is trying to
rewrite constitutional law as it has evolved over the past
century.
   This isn't a new effort; the 54-year-old conservative has
been pressing for changes in approach to constitutional
provisions for most of his four years on the high court. But
the list of constitutional principles that Justice Scalia
would alter keeps getting longer, and the youthful energy and
intellectual zeal he brings to the task make his colleagues
take notice, even if they have given him little support thus
far.

   Last week, as the court term ended, Justice Scalia added a
new constitutional arrow to his quiver. He said he will no
longer consider prisoners' claims that their death sentences
are unconstitutional because jurors had too little discretion
to consider factors that might persuade them to recommend
life imprisonment rather than execution.
   When the Supreme Court called a halt to capital punishment
in 1972, the justices ruled that imposition of the death
penalty couldn't be left totally to the jury's discretion,
that states must provide some standards and guidance for
jurors. In 1976, the court upheld new death-penalty laws from
several states that limited jury discretion.
   But according to Justice Scalia, in a concurring opinion
last week, a "contradiction" has developed in the court's
death-penalty decisions, which are based on interpretation of
the Eighth Amendment prohibition of "cruel and unusual
punishment." The court, he said, has continued to insist that
jury discretion to impose the death penalty must be limited,
but has simultaneously recognized prisoners' arguments that
the jury didn't have enough discretion to consider
extenuating factors that might have tipped the jury in favor
of imprisonment.
   For death-row inmates, Justice Scalia's decision to reject
all claims based on failure to consider extenuating factors
isn't a big threat, as he has rarely voted in favor of
prisoners' claims.
   Ironically, however, his stance puts him in a somewhat
analogous position to the court's leading liberals, Justices
William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who from the opposite
end of the spectrum have refused to accept the court's 1976
finding that state death-penalty laws were constitutional.
The two dissent in every death-penalty case, arguing that
death sentences are "cruel and unusual punishment."
   Another line of constitutional attack by Justice Scalia
became clearer this term. He said he won't accept the court's
rulings striking down state laws that have the effect of
favoring local businesses while discriminating against
companies based in other states.
   The court bases rulings against such state laws on the
premise that the laws interfere with the free flow of
interstate commerce and that the Constitution gives Congress,
not the states, the power to regulate interstate commerce.
   But Justice Scalia argues that the Constitution gives the
power over commerce only to Congress, and doesn't give the
court the authority to strike down state business laws unless
they directly clash with federal law.
   Each time Justice Scalia unleashes a new constitutional
attack, it stirs up touchy and unsettled questions for his
colleagues, as well as for court observers, about the proper
role of precedent.
   When it comes to constitutional precedent, most justices
agree that they have an individual obligation, secured by
their oath of office, to interpret the Constitution as they
see it, and that it would be wrong to subscribe to
constitutional principles with which they disagree. But, as
retired Justice Lewis Powell warned in a speech last year,
too little respect for constitutional precedents "would
represent explicit endorsement of the idea that the
Constitution is nothing more than what five justices say it
is. This would undermine the rule of law."
