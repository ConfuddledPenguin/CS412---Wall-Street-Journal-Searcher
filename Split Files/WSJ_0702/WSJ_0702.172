   Sundstrand Corp., Rockford, Ill., disclosed that it has
accumulated an almost 15% stake in Milton Roy Co. and will
seek to acquire the St. Petersburg, Fla., maker of
instrumentation and control equipment.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Sundstrand said it holds 796,000 Milton Roy shares, or
14.99%. In a release, Sundstrand said it acquired the stock
"with the intention of holding it as an investment in the
near term," but "with the ultimate goal of initiating
negotiations that will lead to an acquisition."

   Sundstrand, which makes aerospace and industrial
equipment, said it considers Milton Roy an "attractive
strategic fit." In St. Petersburg, John McNamara, chief
financial officer of Milton Roy, said: "We have a stated
desire to remain independent." He added, however, that the
board recognizes that it has "a fiduciary responsibility to
assess the fairness and adequacy of any offer presented."
   Sundstrand's filing wasn't disclosed until after the
market closed Friday. In composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Milton Roy stock closed at $22.875, off 12.5
cents; the company has about 5.3 million shares outstanding.
