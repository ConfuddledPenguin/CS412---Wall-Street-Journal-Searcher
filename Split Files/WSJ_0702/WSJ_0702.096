   May Not Be Timely

   WASHINGTON -- The House Ways and Means Committee recently
held a retreat on the subject of the Uruguay Round, the
latest multination effort to push the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade farther toward free and open world
commerce. C. Fred Bergsten, who moderated the session, said
the congressmen were skeptical about GATT. They thought
"Super 301," the system the U.S. uses to punish nations that
don't perform in world trade as the U.S. thinks they should,
is just great. Some of them seem to think a Super Duper 301
might be even better.
   Current trade statistics may have added to the feeling
that no new trade rules are needed. The Commerce Department
late last month raised its estimate of the first-quarter
gross national product because of a sharp upward adjustment
of exports. Exports slipped slightly in April, but imports
fell even more. So when Mr. Bergsten last week moderated
another conference, this one at his Institute for
International Economics, there was pessimism about the
chances of replacing America's unilateral trade policy with
an expanded multilateral approach.

   Last week Mr. Bergsten, in an understatement, told an
audience of academics, businessmen and government officials
that there was "some doubt" about the success of the Uruguay
Round. The talks are not scheduled to end until next
December, he noted, and international negotiations in the
past have always had aspects reminiscent of "The Perils of
Pauline" -- with victory finally being snatched from the jaws
of defeat. "But this time," he said, "we may be in more
trouble than usual."
                                                                                                       

   Carla Hills, the U.S. Trade Representative, told the
conference that President Bush at next week's Houston
economic summit will say that a successful Uruguay Round is
his most important economic objective. "It is beyond my
comprehension," she said, "that with so much at stake we
would not make the Uruguay Round work."
                                                                                                       

   It would be ironic to see the talks break down at a time
when, outside the negotiations, there seems to be momentum
toward free trade. The U.S. and Canada, after arguing about
their trade relations for more than a century, finally
concluded a free trade agreement. Mexico is talking about a
similar pact with the U.S. Brazil, long a strong
protectionist, last week announced it would lower tariffs and
ease import restrictions. Also last week, Mr. Bush proposed a
free-trade zone for the entire Western Hemisphere. The
nations of Eastern Europe, meanwhile, are hoping that
something like GATT will help them move toward economic
parity with the West.
   While failure of the round would be ironic, it is clearly
possible. A major U.S. goal in the current round is reform of
agricultural trade. The GATT nations have tried for reform
several times before, usually getting almost nowhere. "This
time," Dale-Hathaway, a consultant, said, "the talks seem to
be right on track." If there is a difference between the
current round and its predecessors, it could be that the
disagreements have increased.
   "Pressure at the economic summit won't help," Mr. Hathaway
said. "World leaders don't burden themselves with
agricultural problems."
                                                                                                       

   In the past the agricultural arguments have been "settled"
by postponing any difficult decisions to the next
multilateral meeting. But many of the developing countries
have a lot of agricultural goods they could sell if trade
restraints were reduced, and their support is needed if any
progress is to be made in several other areas. So failure in
agriculture could have broader effects.
                                                                                                       

   The current GATT round, for instance, is looking seriously
at services for the first time. The U.S., which is highly
efficient in services, wants the agreement to guarantee the
right to establish a business in a foreign country for the
purpose of providing a service. Several of the developing
countries would exclude any such provision. Brian Hindley of
the London School of Economics, who discussed the service
negotiations, said: "In a way, I'm an optimist. Unless the
whole round unravels, I think there will be an agreement on
trade in services. But the content of that agreement is far
from clear."
   Intellectual property is another area where the U.S. and
other industrial countries need support from the developing
world. The developed countries, as major exporters of
technology, want protection of trademarks, copyrights and
patents. Many developing countries, even if they agree with
protection in principle, lack either the will or the strength
to enforce it. The developing countries are hungry for
technology and tend to be leery of any rules that impede its
inflow.
                                                                                                       

   The issues are incredibly complex.
   One speaker last week argued that the time had come for a
thorough overhaul of the GATT organization. A major reason
for the U.S. move to unilateral settlement of trade disputes,
after all, is frustration with lengthy and uncertain GATT
dispute-settlement procedures.
                                                                                                       

   Meanwhile, many congressmen figure the U.S. is doing fine
with the status quo. How can the free traders convert
Congress? Henry R. Nau, a George Washington University
professor, suggests that the negotiators can do it by
bringing in a successful Uruguay Round agreement. Anyone who
listened to the talks last week knows that's a tough job.
