   Campbell Soup Co., extending the restructuring program it
started in August 1989, said it will sell several North
American businesses and close three plants.
   In connection with the latest moves, the food company will
take a charge of $247 million, or about $1.90 a share,
against earnings for the fiscal year ending July 29.

   David W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer,
said the asset sales and plant closures represent the end of
the rapid cost-cutting necessary to boost Campbell's
profitability. "The tough but necessary decision-making is
over," Mr. Johnson said. "We are now released to go forward."
   When combined with charges for the sale of some European
operations, announced last month, Campbell will take a hit of
$302 million, or $2.33 a share, in fiscal 1990, probably
wiping out most of Campbell's earnings for the second
consecutive year. In fiscal 1989, net income was $13.1
million, or 10 cents a share, including a charge of $261
million, or $2.02 a share, for the restructuring begun last
summer by Mr. Johnson's predecessor, R. Gordon McGovern.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Campbell shares rose 75 cents to $57.25.
   Mr. McGovern, whose plan included closing about nine
plants world-wide, resigned abruptly in November, even as
some members of Campbell's controlling Dorrance family were
growing dissatisfied with the company's financial
performance.
   When Mr. Johnson arrived from Gerber Products Co. in
January, he continued Mr. McGovern's program and began to
re-evaluate all of Campbell's operations. In May, he laid off
14% of the staff at company headquarters in Camden, N.J., and
put up for sale the company's Italian cookie company and
British frozen vegetable and seafood operations.
   The latest businesses to be hoisted onto the auction block
have total annual sales of more than $300 million and include
most of Campbell's fresh and refrigerated products, notably
mushrooms, Domsea Farms seafood, and Marie's salad dressings.
Also up for sale are a frozen poultry operation in Sumter,
S.C., and a Scottish chilled-food plant. In fiscal 1989 total
sales were $5.67 billion.
   Campbell is closing plants in Fremont, Neb., and Grand
Prairie, Texas, and an equipment center in Moorestown, N.J.
About 341 employees will lose their jobs.
   Industry analysts expressed surprise at the magnitude of
the charge but hailed the decision as the latest example of
Mr. Johnson's commitment to improving Campbell's earnings
growth and return on equity, which have ranked near the
bottom of the industry for the past decade.
   "They're selling the junk here," said John McMillin, an
analyst with PrudentialBache Research. "They just didn't have
the scale or the size in refrigerated foods to make money."
   The auctioning of the U.S. fresh and refrigerated foods
businesses and the international divestitures demonstrate
just how much of a break Mr. Johnson would like to make with
the past. Both areas were of special interest to Mr.
McGovern, who sought to make Campbell a global food giant.
"Gordon's dream was to go where the volume growth is," Mr.
McMillin said. "It's Johnson's dream to make money."
   One reason behind the latest round of asset sales is Mr.
Johnson's need to placate a dissident group of Dorrance
shareholders that is seeking a sale of the company. "We're
going to show that this team of professional management is
the preferred and best management of Campbell Soup Co.
assets," Mr. Johnson said.
