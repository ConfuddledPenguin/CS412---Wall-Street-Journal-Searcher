   HOLLYWOOD -- Even in this town of flamboyant spenders,
37-year-old movie producer Joel Silver stands out.
   At an estimated cost of $62 million, his "Die Hard 2: Die
Harder," an extravaganza that opens on Wednesday, has become
one of the most expensive films ever made. "At one point we
thought we were spending $1 million a day," says Joe Roth,
chairman of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox, the movie's
backer. "It was like walking down the street and finding a
hole in your pocket."

   Mr. Silver has made others in Hollywood feel the same way.
His free-spending ways, along with his temper tantrums and
coarse manner, have alienated studio executives and
secretaries alike. But the success of his highly commercial
action movies such as "Predator" and "Lethal Weapon" has
redeemed him in the eyes of others.
   Spy magazine labeled him a "taste-free bullyboy." Actor
Rick Moranis parodied him as a fast-talking hysteric in the
movie "Head Office." Mr. Silver even played himself, a
screaming movie maker, in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." But he
became the subject of gossip over the spending on "Die Hard
2," and Hollywood has been buzzing with stories of improper
use of studio funds.
   Mr. Silver declined to be interviewed. Through a
spokesman, he denies any wrongdoing. Fox itself insists that
a regular internal audit turned up no evidence of any
misappropriation of funds. Mr. Roth does say the studio has
increased its auditing staff as a result of the cost
overruns. The studio also took greater control of the set of
"Predator 2," produced by Mr. Silver and two other producers.
   "We are becoming more aggressive rather than reactive,"
says Mr. Roth. He adds: "Joel is an extravagant producer. He
is not irresponsible. He has a big appetite and a very wide
vision."
   He isn't the only one. A record year at the U.S. box
office and growing demand for American movies abroad have
loosened Hollywood's purse strings. Studios are spending
enormous sums on potential hits. Paramount Pictures' "Days of
Thunder" and Carolco's "Total Recall" each cost more than $50
million to produce.
   Mr. Silver's fans are quick to observe that, with various
partners, he has produced some of Hollywood's top-grossing
movies. With Richard Donner he made "Lethal Weapon 2," which
has grossed roughly $250 million. In February, the National
Association of Theater Owners named Mr. Silver producer of
the year, noting that revenues of films he helped produce had
topped $1 billion.
   Warner Brothers, which backed "Lethal Weapon" and its
sequel, also loves Mr. Silver. He recently signed a five-year
contract with the studio, which expects to back two or three
of his pictures a year. He commands one of Hollywood's
highest producer fees, $1 million a picture. He runs his
company, Silver Pictures, from a luxurious bungalow on the
Warner lot that once belonged to actress Marion Davies.
   Warner Brothers has even let Mr. Silver use one of its
jets to fly friends to his sprawling plantation in South
Carolina, where he is spending $2.5 million to renovate one
of the two Frank Lloyd Wright houses he owns. Actor Bruce
Willis, star of "Die Hard" and its sequel, and his wife, Demi
Moore, have been guests.
   "He is one of our most important producers," says Mark
Canton, an executive vice president of Warner Brothers, a
Time Warner division. "Joel Silver is as respected and
friendly with the cream of the crop of Hollywood as anyone I
know."
   But Mr. Silver's screaming matches have alienated senior
executives at several big studios, including Paramount and
Walt Disney Co. "Joel will let nothing stand in the way of
achieving his vision. You have to be prepared to battle him
along the way," says Leonard Goldberg, an independent
producer and a former head of Twentieth Century Fox who
worked with Mr. Silver on "Die Hard."
   Mr. Silver, son of a public-relations executive father and
a journalist mother, grew up in South Orange, N.J. An ardent
student of the old Hollywood, he attended New York University
film school. "Everyone else wanted to be a director,
cameraman or editor," recalls Jack Rapke, an agent at
Creative Artists Agency and a former classmate. "Joel had a
love affair with the Hollywood moguls. He aspired to be a
producer like David O. Selznick."
   He later took a job as an assistant to producer Larry
Gordon, a veteran maker of action movies. Friends say Mr.
Silver often served as Mr. Gordon's driver and seemed
desperate to succeed in the movie business; he coveted fine
clothes and possessions he couldn't yet afford. "He was
insanely hungry for money and power, but he didn't have
either, and that made him suffer," says Ken Finkleman, a
friend and the writer and director of "Head Office," the
movie that parodies Mr. Silver. "But his suffering was
endearing. He was funny and knew everything about Hollywood."
   Two of his attempts to leave Mr. Gordon and work within
other movie companies failed, partly because of his attitude
toward authority and spending. After he was hired as a
production executive at Universal Pictures in March of 1979,
he bought art deco furniture for his office and sent the
company a bill for more than $6,500. Insiders at the time say
top executives were stunned because he hadn't asked for
permission first. The company ordered him to pay the bill
himself.
   Mr. Silver also threw a birthday party for himself at
Michael's, a pricey restaurant in Santa Monica. He invited
about 40 guests, including Universal executives. He later
submitted an expense accounting for more than $10,000.
Insiders at the time say the company again told him to pay
up. They say he was fired after less than a year in January
of 1980. While there, he had supervised "Xanadu," one of
Universal's biggest bombs, an over-budget musical starring
Olivia Newton John.
   Mr. Silver had another brief tenure, at Polygram Pictures,
run at the time by producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. He
was brought in by Mr. Guber as an executive vice president of
development and production in April of 1981. He left less
than two months later after repeated clashes with Mr. Peters.
"Sparks flew," recalls Gordon Stulberg, who was president of
the company at the time.
   There were other problems, including spending on the movie
"The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper," which Mr. Silver was asked to
help salvage. Frank Baur, vice president and executive
production manager at the time, says Mr. Silver asked him to
"conceal or delay the reporting on the spending." Mr. Baur
says he refused. He also recalls that Mr. Silver said, "No
{expletive} hairdresser is going to tell me what to do,"
referring to Mr. Peters' former occupation.
   Fred Altman, Mr. Silver's business manager, says Mr.
Baur's statement about concealing spending is "ludicrous." A
lawyer for Mr. Silver, Jake Bloom, says the producer left
both Universal Pictures and Polygram by "mutual consent." He
also says that when Mr. Silver moved to Polygram, that
company agreed to purchase his art deco furniture from
Universal, and when Mr. Silver left Polygram, he bought it
back as part of his settlement.
   Mr. Silver returned to Mr. Gordon and has worked with him
on and off ever since. Their first big hit was "48 Hours," an
action movie starring Eddie Murphy that grossed about $100
million. But Mr. Silver and Mr. Gordon have since had their
share of disappointments, such as "Streets of Fire," a big
money loser for Universal. Some of Mr. Silver's attempts to
produce movies on his own didn't fare particularly well at
the box office, such as "Road House" and "Weird Science."
   Mr. Gordon remains the senior partner, and his producer
credit comes first on Gordon-Silver films such as "Die Hard"
and its sequel. But it is Mr. Silver who usually spends long
hours on the set. Unlike many producers, he deeply involves
himself in every stage of a movie, from script development
through final editing. He has aggressively pursued stars such
as Arnold Schwarzenegger for his movies. "No one fights
harder to get a movie made," says Mr. Gordon.
   Some people think he fights too hard. His aggressiveness
has led him to bulldoze anything that stands in his way --
sometimes almost literally.
   Stalled by a line of cars at the Fox studio guard gate
during the filming of "Die Hard," he once ordered the driver
of his Mercedes-Benz to enter at the exit. An irate Fox
official ripped the identification decal off his car and
banned Mr. Silver from the lot. Mr. Goldberg finally decided
to ban only the car and driver. "It sounds like a childish
solution but I was anxious to get him back," says Mr.
Goldberg.
   People who stand in his way sometimes suffer his wrath. An
official of the Los Angeles airport once ordered Mr. Silver
to come up with a $100,000 deposit to continue filming
"Commando" after a spat over moving an X-ray machine. "He
told me how important he was, and he said he would have my
head," says Lang Moy, assistant to the chief of airport
operations. "I thought he had an ego problem. I guess he
feels very impressed with himself. He feels he can buy and
sell people."
   Mr. Silver's Rambo-style personality seems suited to the
action genre. For a scene in the original "Die Hard," he even
pressed to create a real explosion on a lower floor of Fox
Plaza, a major Los Angeles office building then owned by Fox.
"He promised he could get it cleaned up and the windows back
in over the weekend," says Craig Baumgarten, executive vice
president of production at Fox at the time. Fox overruled Mr.
Silver and the scene was filmed in miniature with scale
models.
   Fox itself is partly to blame for the cost of making "Die
Hard 2." Mr. Roth, who joined Fox last August, didn't decide
until October to rush the movie into production for summer
release. That gave the crew little time to prepare for the
big-scale airport thriller, which requires snow scenes. Mr.
Silver led the hapless crew of more than 200 from one city to
another in search of snow as weather forecasts failed them.
Mr. Roth received bills as high as $50,000 for dry ice and
$100,000 a day for the use of a Boeing 747.
   As the costs escalated, worried Fox executives looked for
ways to save money, and Mr. Silver kept fighting for scenes
he wanted. "I was getting phone calls at midnight," says
Roger Birnbaum, president of production at Fox. Mr. Silver,
he recalls, would typically say, "You're killing me] You're
killing me] I'm out here and I'm going to give you a $100
million movie. If you don't give me this, the movie will be a
flop. It will be on your shoulders]"
   During the filming, Mr. Silver helped to organize a
birthday party for Mr. Willis, the movie's star, at a bowling
alley in Studio City. Those on the invitation list, including
Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy, received bowling shirts
with their names embroidered above the pockets, by messenger.
The party cost about $10,000, which didn't come from the
movie's budget. It was paid for by Mr. Silver, Twentieth
Century Fox, Warner Brothers, Tri-Star Pictures and Triad
Artists, a talent management agency.
   Still, as the movie's cost kept climbing, Fox's largess
waned. Fox sent John Landau, a new senior executive vice
president of production, and Tom Jacobson, executive vice
president, to the sets of both "Die Hard 2" and "Predator 2"
to control costs. "As the picture became more difficult, we
asked to be involved in any decision that wasn't in the
budget," says Mr. Jacobson. "They were big money decisions."
   Insiders say Fox executives are now unlikely to pursue
three additional projects they have in development with Mr.
Silver. But "Ford Fairlane," another Fox movie produced by
Mr. Silver, is expected to be released this summer.
   While the cost of the movie may have dismayed Fox, Mr.
Silver's spending habits clearly please his crews. "The
difference between working for Joel and another producer is
the difference between flying baggage and first class," says
Nancy Hansen, a script supervisor. "His caterer serves
Chateaubriand steak that is so tender you can cut it with a
plastic fork."
   Mr. Silver, who collects pottery and Frank Lloyd
Wright-designed furniture, once told a gathering of studio
executives, "I'm not in this business to make art. I'm in
this business to make money to buy art." Six years ago he
paid about $726,000 for the Storer house, a concrete-block
home in the fashionable Hollywood Hills designed by Mr.
Wright in the 1920s. Its restoration has been chronicled in
House &amp; Garden.
   His greatest indulgence may be the Auldbrass Plantation on
more than 200 acres in South Carolina. As part of his $2.5
million renovation, he added a 135-foot swimming pool and a
tennis court. He is also rebuilding the stable, where he
keeps a white Arabian horse, a gift from singer Wayne Newton.
A cook prepares southern dishes such as alligator and key
lime pie for guests.
   His plans proved too grand for friends who bought the
house with him three years ago, and Mr. Silver bought them
out.
   A female associate suggests that Mr. Silver be nicknamed
"Citizen Silver" after the movie based on the life of William
Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate who built the opulent
California castle called San Simeon. Mr. Silver's Auldbrass
Plantation, says Michael Levy, president of Silver Pictures,
"will be his San Simeon."
