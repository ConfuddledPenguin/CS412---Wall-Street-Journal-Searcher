   Once when I was driving along the Autobahn in a rented car
with French license plates, a German driver roared past and
turned around to shake his fist. Puzzling over what this
hostile act could mean, I finally concluded that the German
must have thought I was French.
   If the German-French relationship is touchy, history can
supply reasons. Of all national rivalries throughout time,
this one has been among those costing the most blood. World
War I, that terrible and senseless slaughter pitting France
and Germany as the central protagonists, was in part
attributable to the bitterness still lingering after France's
defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. The rise of
Hitler and the onset of World War II was in turn attributable
in part to the harsh reparation and disarmament terms imposed
on Germany after World War I, mainly at the insistence of
France's Georges Clemenceau.

   Even among intelligent and enlightened Germans and
Frenchmen -- and after 45 years of peace -- a bit of
nationalist choler occasionally bubbles up during political
discussions. Although the French maintain a close cooperative
liaison with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, they
have chosen to keep their military forces free of NATO's
joint command.
   Which makes it all the more interesting that West
Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and French President
Francois Mitterrand have lately become the Tweedledum and
Tweedledee of Europe. At the summit gathering of heads of
state of the 12 European Community nations in Dublin a week
ago, they made common cause against Britain's Margaret
Thatcher, a lady regarded by the one as "ein grosser
kopfschmerz" and the other as "un grand mal de tete". In
other words, she is a headache for both.
   The French and Germans were united in Dublin, at least
superficially, on aid to the Soviet Union, creation of a
single European currency and EC political union. But Mrs.
Thatcher demurred on all three, knowing that the
French-German entente was not strong enough to overwhelm her.
   Mr. Mitterrand gave his imprimatur to German unification
last year well before the Berlin Wall came down. The Germans
were grateful but the French president knew that opposition
would cost him more than he could gain. When the
German-Polish border issue came up, however, he played
hardball with the Germans and won, helping force the Germans
to guarantee the existing border. Some Germans were
resentful, but to little avail.
   On the other hand, French-German monetary cooperation has
worked well for both sides. The French have for some years
now kept their franc in step with the strong deutsche mark,
and have benefited enormously. Paris -- "voila]" -- suddenly
has become an interesting financial center. French inflation
has been modest. There is no evidence at all that French
industry has suffered from having a hard currency, a lesson
that Britain seems to have great trouble grasping.
   This successful monetary partnership, based on the
solidity of a Bundesbank that enjoys significant political
independence, has helped strengthen Franco-German ties. It
also has hampered Mrs. Thatcher, who can't seem to get
inflation under control, in trying to bring her influence to
bear on the question of creating a European central bank and
a common European currency. She nonetheless had some success
in Dublin by offering a transitory step toward a single
currency, one that would not disturb national monetary
sovereignty. It calls for creating a "hard ECU" for public
use, thereby testing the market response to a single
currency. If acceptance will get England into the EC money
system, the others may buy it.
   But the big issue in the EC is something called "political
union," and it is in this area that the seeming Franco-German
comity is the most interesting -- and in some sense, most
implausible. When a BBC interviewer asked British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd if a summit decision to convene a
constitutional conference in Rome Dec. 15 meant the EC was
heading toward political union, he seemed surprised at her
credulity. The foreign secretary wanted to know if she really
believed that Mr. Mitterrand was prepared to surrender his
control over French foreign and security policy. The EC
countries probably will continue to do what they do now, he
said, taking common positions on the things they can agree
about and national positions on those that they can't.
   Which brings us again to the Franco-German entente and its
focus on political unification. It is precisely because of a
long history of emnity that the French and Germans have a
common interest in European political unity. That is not the
same thing as unification, but it more precisely defines what
Messrs. Kohl and Mitterrand have in mind. Both know -- and
have known for some time -- that activation of the
German-German economic treaty today would represent de facto
German reunification. Germany now has potential to be a major
political power in addition to what it already is, the
dominant economic power in Europe. Both leaders want to make
sure this does not disturb the peaceful relationships that
have been built so painstakingly and successfully since World
War II. The Germans don't want a suspicious Europe making
common cause against Germany. The French don't want a new
rise of German nationalism that might threaten France.
   The EC and NATO are the answers to those fears. So long as
Germany is part of an integrated Europe there can be a great
deal of assurance -- even if not absolute -- that it will not
attempt to follow an independent course in foreign policy.
That there will be deviations, of course, was suggested at
the summit, where Mr. Kohl displayed much frustration with a
reluctance among his EC partners to come up with an aid
package for the Soviet Union. Germany has more important
reasons than the others for wanting to round up money for the
Soviets. It wants to induce the Soviets to pull their 360,000
troops out of Germany as quickly as possible without
conditions. The Soviets want money and the Germans want to
give it to them, but preferably with other Europeans chipping
in.
   In short, the nations of Europe always will have certain
foreign policy interests that cannot be reduced to a common
EC policy. The same goes for domestic policy, but perhaps to
a lesser extent. But Herr Kohl and M. Mitterrand are trying
to make sure that the interests of their two countries do not
diverge in any way that might reawaken the nationalistic
demons of the past. It is a constructive effort and even
though it sometimes yields up rhetorical fantasies about the
potential for political union, it offers strong hope that
Europe will achieve enough unity to avoid repeating the
darkest moments of its history.
