   POCASSET, Mass. -- Datamarine International Inc., a marine
instruments maker, said Howard H. Hill, 58 years old,
resigned as chairman, president, and chief executive officer
"to pursue other interests."
   Mr. Hill, one of the company's founders, said the
resignation was voluntary. David Thompson, chief operating
officer, will be acting chief executive, while the board
searches for a new president and chief executive. The company
said it hadn't named a new chairman and isn't looking for
one.
