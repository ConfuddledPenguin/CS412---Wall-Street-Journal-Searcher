   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said it hopes to get its space shuttle fleet
flying soon, after grounding it for the first time since the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   The space agency, already reeling from news that the $2.5
billion Hubble space telescope was fundamentally flawed, said
it is idling its three space shuttles. The snafus already
have drawn criticism on Capitol Hill and cast doubt on
continued support for such other big-ticket NASA projects as
plans to return to the Moon and to explore Mars.

   NASA grounded the shuttles after discovering a fuel leak
on the shuttle Atlantis strikingly similar to a leak found in
May on the shuttle Columbia. The space agency removed
Columbia from the launch pad and returned it to the assembly
building for repair.
   "We won't fly until we understand the problem and have a
fix," said William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight.
   Both shuttles had leaks of hydrogen fuel, NASA said,
somewhere in an assemblage of piping that leads from the
shuttle's external fuel tank to the orbiter. The agency said
a 17-inch-diameter fuel line "is contributing to the leak."
The fuel line assembly is made by Parker Hannifin Corp. in
Cleveland, NASA said.
   But a spokesman for Parker Hannifin said the company makes
only "certain components" of the assembly and that tests so
far haven't indicated any problems with these parts. "We make
a piece of the action, but not the whole thing," the
spokesman said.
   The duration of the grounding is difficult to gauge, Mr.
Lenoir said, because NASA hasn't found the source of the
leaks. At a minimum, NASA plans to roll Atlantis back to its
hangar and expects a launch delay of several weeks. Atlantis
was scheduled to launch a military reconnaissance satellite
in mid-July.
   But if the cause of the leak is a design flaw in the
assembly, the grounding could stretch on for months or years.
Simply building a new piping assembly takes more than a year,
said shuttle director Robert Crippen. NASA is designing an
improved assembly, he said, but that work is several years
from completion.
   Locating the cause of the leak has proved to be tough.
NASA said it returned part of the Columbia piping assembly to
Rockwell International Corp., which has overall
responsibility for the orbiter, but that engineers there
hadn't been able to reproduce the leak. NASA suspects that
the leak appears only on the launch pad because the pipes
there are subjected to ultracold temperatures and a fast flow
of liquid hydrogen that can't be reproduced in the lab.
   The space agency first assumed that the leak was a quirk
on Columbia, but finding it again on Atlantis threw out that
assumption. Problems that cut across the shuttle fleet are
more difficult, costly and time-consuming to repair.
   NASA had expected to launch a $150 million shuttle-based
observatory and the spy satellite by shuttle this summer, but
both now are at risk of being delayed past October. At that
time, the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch the
Ulysses spacecraft, which will study the sun. If NASA misses
the Ulysses launch period, the European-built craft will have
to be delayed for 13 months until the planets are in proper
alignment for the launch. Ulysses will travel to Jupiter
before heading over the solar poles.
   Meanwhile, NASA was struggling to overcome the political
difficulties caused by the Hubble malfunction. Sen. Albert
Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of the science, technology and
space subcommittee, grilled several NASA officials about the
spacecraft's problems. Hubble indicated NASA's inability to
manage large projects, he said. "At the present time, NASA's
eyes are bigger than its stomach," the lawmaker said.
