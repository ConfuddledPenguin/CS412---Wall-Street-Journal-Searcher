   INDIANA TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- People who are antsy about bugs
shouldn't read this story, and definitely shouldn't visit
Peggy Uminski right now. Because when Mrs. Uminski is asked
if that sound outside is rain, she replies: Oh no, that's
just the sound of thousands of caterpillars munching on
everything around the house and then excreting millions of
peppercorn-sized pellets.
   Gypsy moth season has arrived here in its grossest form.
In their current state, the insects are hairy caterpillars,
swarming over houses and devouring majestic oaks. They're
everywhere, from toilets to patio furniture, turning areas
all around Pittsburgh into an Indiana Jones nightmare. "It's
really like a grade B horror movie," says Launa Haney Post,
looking up at trees where two-inch caterpillars hang like
fuzzy black tinsel.

   And an uncivil war has broken out in small towns like
Murrysville over what to do about it. Sharon Malhotra
received angry phone calls at night. "Zealot]" "Fanatic]" Her
crime: She and her Citizens for Responsible Pest Management
are lobbying against the use of chemical pesticides, fearful
of the health effects. The callers, convinced that the moths
are a bigger threat than the spray, want to blast the insects
into chemical oblivion.
   "It gets to be a real donnybrook," says James Pierce,
staff scientist of Environmental Action, a Washington, D.C.,
organization that assists local opposition to chemical
pesticides. In one of Virginia's finest neighborhoods, he
recalls, the issue became so emotional that neighbors got
into fistfights, bullied each other's children and threatened
to kill each other's pets.
   There is no question that the gypsy moth is a pest, and
has been since 1869, when a French bug fancier, trying to
breed a better silk caterpillar in the U.S., brought some
over from Europe. Unfortunately, he forgot to close his
window and some escaped, causing moth mayhem in his hometown
of Medford, Mass. By the following year, caterpillars were so
thick in Medford that passers-by couldn't tell the color of
houses.
   Since then, the moths have spread south and west. They
arrived in Pennsylvania decades ago, first honeymooning in
the Poconos before pouncing on Pittsburgh, this year's hot
spot. They're expected to linger a few more years before
their feeding frenzy moves them southwest.
   To fight back, towns in the Pittsburgh area appointed
Gypsy Moth Coordinators, who help track and destroy the
caterpillars. Residents call gypsy moth hotlines and read
gyspy moth newsletters. In some schools, sixth graders have
raised moths for science class and written journals on the
life and death of caterpillars with names like Mitsy, Betsy
and Tootsie.
   There's even a gypsy moth song published by the American
Forestry Association -- the "Inch Along Song." Some of the
lyrics: "Worms we are, a moth we'll be, fat, happy and free.
In-ching a-long, inching a-long, in-ching a-long, just you
and me."
   Even the most ardent nature lovers are repulsed. "I hate
them," says Gary Stokum, manager of the Washington County
Conservation District. The moths' only redeeming quality is
that they die quickly. The caterpillars hatch in the spring
from eggs laid by last year's moths. Then they enter the pupa
stage -- tiny, beef-jerky-like things -- and emerge as moths
in July. In this last leg of life, female moths, who
fortunately are too fat to fly anywhere, lay quarter-sized
egg masses, each with about 500 eggs. The moths die by the
end of summer.
   The caterpillars are 24-hour eating machines. They trample
blindly over each other as they scale trees, lampposts and
barns in search of their Holy Grail -- the oak leaf. Once the
oaks are stripped, they'll eat anything green short of
Astroturf.
   They hide everywhere, trespassing No Trespassing signs,
cruising in old tires and lounging on patio furniture. They
hold people like Mrs. Uminski hostages in their own homes. On
Father's Day, the ravenous rampage was just too repulsive for
the Uminskis and their dinner guests. The menu was changed
from barbequed chicken to Shake 'n Bake and the party was
moved inside.
   She and her neighbors have become Raid-bearing Rambos.
They stab and crush the moths, using fly swatters, penknives,
machetes and ice picks, before drowning them in jugs of
bleach.
   Ms. Uminski says her four-year-old daughter used to panic
when she saw caterpillars. "Now she just stomps on them like
everyone else." The desperate haul out propane torches to
crisp the critters, unfortunately sometimes toasting trees as
well. And while most try to save valuable trees, the truly
vanquished cut them all down.
   "It's as much a financial and social problem as a
biological one," says Environmental Action's Mr. Pierce. It's
also a political can of worms. Here in Indiana Township, flag
burning doesn't hold a candle to gypsy moths as the No. 1
issue. Some residents are mobilizing against township
supervisors for refusing to participate in a state-sponsored
spray program because of liability concerns.
   "We want to vote them out," says Janet Giel, who found
caterpillars crawling on her closet and floating in her
toilet.
   Fred Rimmel of the Audubon Society refused any spray for
the society's 136-acre Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve in
Allegheny County, even though it could mean the loss of some
200-year-old oak trees. Some oak-loving, moth-hating society
members quit paying dues. Nearby residents blasted him in
letters to local newspapers for sentencing the mighty oaks to
death.
   Mr. Rimmel argues that the bacteria spray may affect other
caterpillars, which are food for young birds. Still, people
look at him disparagingly, he says, as a "right-to-lifer for
moths."
   The debate was neatly set in letters to the editor of a
small newspaper called the Ligonier Echo. Eric Oesterling, a
Westmoreland County agricultural agent, argued that the
chemical pesticide Dimilin, which is the most effective in
highly infested gypsy moth areas, is "one of the safest and
least toxic insecticides man has ever known. . . . By
comparison, it is less acutely toxic than either table salt
or aspirin."
   In response, two local doctors, Dale Fruman and N.K.
Malhotra, wrote that being "one of the least toxic
insecticides" is like being a little pregnant. The doctors
expressed concern about the long-term effects of all toxic
chemicals and noted that once Dimilin is broken down, one of
its byproducts has produced cancer in laboratory animals.
   "Mr. Oesterling may be willing to have his eggs with
Dimilin," they wrote. "We still put table salt on ours."
   Allegheny County officials initially planned to spray
100,000 acres this year. But only about 25,000 acres got
juiced, due partly to citizens' chemical angst, says Michael
Blumenthal, the state's forest pest management specialist.
"People get upset and worry about their kids and their health
when you say `spray,'" he says.
   Professional hit men have sprung up. One mothbuster, Mark
Ticehurst, formerly of the state's forest bureau, founded the
National Gypsy Moth Management Group Inc. of Landisburg, Pa.
"Gypsy moths are our bag," he says.
   The private consulting group of professional entomologists
and biologists has monitored and sprayed the moth population
in the well-heeled suburb of Fox Chapel, collecting $230,000.
The company also releases parasitic wasps and gnats to help
kill Fox Chapel's moths, provides education materials and
conducts town meetings.
   A federally funded program in Morgantown, W.Va., called
the Appalachian Integrated Pest Management Demonstration
Project, is trying to check the mating habits of gypsy moths.
In one project, the scent females use to lure male moths is
artificially reproduced and released into the environment.
The idea is to lead the male on a wild moth chase until he
dies.
   Scientists have also used the $7 million federal grant to
try to figure out a way to develop a sterile male moth to
compete with virile moths for the female.
   Erik Mollenhauer, a New Jersey education consultant, is
flitting across the country trying to sell his Just Say No to
gypsy moths campaign to teachers. He has a packet that
includes an inch-thick planning guide, a 9-minute videotape
and a gypsy moth board game that looks like a cross between
Monopoly and gypsy moth Trivial Pursuit, with questions like
"What is the nickname of the ground beetle that feeds on
gypsy moths?" (Answer: Caterpillar hunters.)
   Mr. Mollenhauer envisions children and parents together
embarking on search and destroy missions. As he says, "It's a
lot more effective than a picture in a post office saying
`Have you seen this bug?'"
