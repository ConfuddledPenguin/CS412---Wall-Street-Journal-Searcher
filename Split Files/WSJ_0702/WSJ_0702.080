   Concerning your May 30 article "More Employers Check
Credit Histories of Job Seekers to Judge Their Character":
   Employers who check credit histories of job seekers should
be warned that the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code
prohibit them from discriminating against those who have been
bankrupt or have failed to pay debts that are dischargeable
in bankruptcy: 11 U.S.C. 525(b).
