   A federal court jury in Boston awarded Cool Light Co. of
Hollywood, Calif., $16 million in punitive and compensatory
damages to be paid by GTE Products Corp., a unit of GTE
Corp., Stamford, Conn., for fraud, breach of contract and
failure to deal "fairly and in good faith."
   Cool Light, a maker of television studio lights that
generate 80% less heat than traditional studio lights,
alleged that GTE Products, a Danvers, Mass., lighting
products maker, breached a contract to make parts of Cool
Light's product and subsequently produced its own version of
the light. Cool Light brought in a host of celebrities,
including the actors Michael Landon, Ed Asner and Angie
Dickinson, to testify in the trial on behalf of the light's
inventor, George Panagiotou.

   GTE Products officials denied any wrongdoing and said they
are considering an appeal. "We're disappointed at the jury's
verdict and a little puzzled, because we continue to believe
that we did nothing wrong," Vincent D'Alessandro, a GTE
Products vice president, said.
