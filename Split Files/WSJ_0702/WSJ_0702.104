   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill that would
guarantee workers leave from their jobs of as much as 12
weeks a year for childbirth, adoption or serious family
illnesses.
   Mr. Bush, whose veto was expected, said he opposes the
legislation because of its "rigid, federally imposed
requirements." Noting that U.S. companies face their
"stiffest competition in history," he said employers need
flexibility in offering benefits to workers.

   The veto was the president's 13th since he took office,
and is likely to be sustained by Congress, as were his
previous 12 vetoes. But Democrats seem certain to seize on
the veto as a campaign issue. They noted that Mr. Bush
pledged in his 1988 election campaign to protect women's
jobs, though he didn't specify whether he favored any federal
family-leave requirement.
   "No working mother should be forced to choose between the
child she loves and the job she needs," Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, said.
"The president might as well try to veto motherhood."
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the measure's chief
sponsor, has said the Senate, which approved the bill by a
voice vote earlier last month, is within two or three votes
of the necessary two-thirds margin to override the veto. But
in the House, "It's going to be a tough road" to win enough
support for an override, said an aide to Rep. Curt Weldon
(R., Pa.), a leading House sponsor of the bill. The House
passed the bill in May by a 237-187 margin, 50 votes short of
override strength.
   "I do not want Republicans to be blamed for killing the
Family and Medical Leave Act," Mr. Weldon said of the bill.
   Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, another Republican who
backed the bill, said in an interview that she was "stunned
and dismayed" by the speed of the veto of a bill offering a
"minimum job benefit," and noted that Mr. Bush declined to
meet with some GOP members of Congress on the issue. The
president "has signed mandates before," she said. "I don't
know why he has a blind spot on this one."
   While women's and family-oriented organizations decried
the veto, business groups applauded it.
   "Mandated parental leave is not only an anti-business
idea, but . . . it discriminates against those unable to take
advantage of the leave, discriminates against those forced on
overtime because of its requirements, and discriminates
against those who would prefer other fringe benefits, which
would be eliminated if this measure were enacted," said John
Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, a small-business group.
