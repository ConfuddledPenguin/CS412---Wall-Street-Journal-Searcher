   Amrep officials were unavailable to elaborate on the
results.
   In early June, Kane-Miller Corp., a Tarrytown, N.Y., food
processor, disclosed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it owned 8.1% of Amrep and that it might seek
control of the company. Later in the month, Peter B. Bedford,
a Lafayette, Calif., real estate developer, about doubled his
Amrep holding to 16.16% and said he and the company had
discussed a possible board seat for him or a representative.
