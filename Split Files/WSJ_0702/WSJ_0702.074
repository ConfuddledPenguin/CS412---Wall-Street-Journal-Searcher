   TORONTO -- More than 1,100 mine workers at Brunswick
Mining &amp; Smelting Corp.'s zinc and lead mine began striking
after voting to reject what the company has called its
"final" contract offer.
   Meantime, contract talks covering 3,500 workers at
Vancouver, British Columbia-based Cominco Ltd. continued
through the weekend after workers last week voted down the
company's latest offer and authorized the union bargaining
committee to call a strike. A union spokesman said the union
plans to continue bargaining at least until tomorrow.

   Workers at both companies are represented by local
affiliates of the United Steelworkers of America. Contracts
at both companies expired Saturday.
   Cominco and Brunswick Mining, 64%-owned by Toronto's
Noranda Inc., are Canada's largest and second largest
producers of zinc and lead. Prices of these metals on world
markets were bolstered last week in anticipation of a
possible strike, and analysts expect a cutoff of zinc and
lead supplies from either company could boost prices further.
   Picket lines went up at the Brunswick mine near Bathurst,
New Brunswick, yesterday, said Larry Urbanoski, a
superintendent at the mine. "We're going through a process of
arranging an orderly shutdown of the plant," he said. As of
midday yesterday, there weren't any new talks scheduled
between the union and the company, he said.
   Blair Doucet, president of Local 5385 of the United
Steelworkers, said late last week that the two sides are
"still quite a ways away" from reaching agreement. He said
workers rejected Brunswick Mining's offer, which includes a
20% wage boost over three years and increased monthly pension
payments, because they are determined to make up ground after
the company "got away cheap" in the last round of talks.
   Brunswick Mining officials couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Brunswick Mining estimates its production of zinc and lead
accounts for roughly 5% and 1.5%, respectively, of Western
world output.
   Cominco produces about 5.8% of the Western world's refined
zinc, and 2.6% of the West's lead, at its big Trail, British
Columbia, smelter complex. Cominco also owns British
Columbia's Sullivan lead-zinc mine, where output was
suspended earlier this year due to operating losses.
