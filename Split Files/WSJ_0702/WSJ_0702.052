   A June 22 letter from Czech Presi- dent Vaclav Havel to
Cuban leader Fidel Castro:

   I was sorry to hear that the court in Havana gave long
custodial sentences yesterday to seven representatives of the
opposition. Their only crime was that they demanded that Cuba
be launched on the path toward pluralism, democracy, and a
market economy: that is, on the path which is followed today
by all former totalitarian countries of Central and Eastern
Europe.
   Mr. President, I firmly protest against the decision of
Cuban justice, which I see as another step of your country
toward the darkest past, as a gross violation of basic human
rights, and as an insult to the civilized world. I,
therefore, request that you ask for an immediate release of
all unjustly condemned.
