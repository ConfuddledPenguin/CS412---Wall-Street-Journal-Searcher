   CHICAGO -- McDonald's Corp. will announce today that it's
ending its mini-billboard campaign for its new cheddar cheese
hamburger.
   The ill-fated effort to promote the Cheddar Melt on
newsracks for the Chicago Observer, a newspaper sponsored by
outdoor advertising concerns, drew the ire of many Chicago
residents and civic groups. Hundreds of three-foot by
four-foot signs appeared on sidewalks here last week. The
signs prompted Mayor Richard M. Daley to introduce an
ordinance in the City Council restricting the size of
newsracks and banning advertising on them.

   Rick Johnson, marketing supervisor for McDonald's Chicago
region, said McDonald's had asked the Chicago Observer to
pull the signs from its boxes. The action was taken after a
meeting of the board of Chicago-area franchise
owner-operators with McDonald's officials, according to Mr.
Johnson. "Our concern for the local environment was more
important than our concern for this particular (advertising)
communication," Mr. Johnson said.
