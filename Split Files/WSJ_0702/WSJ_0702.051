   NEW YORK -- Amerada Hess Corp. said a Canadian company
owned jointly by its Amerada Minerals Corp. of Canada Ltd.
subsidiary and by Poco Petroleums Ltd. of Canada, agreed to
purchase a Canadian oil and gas company for 305.5 million
Canadian dollars (US$260 million).
   The companies will purchase Placer Cego Petroleum Holdings
Ltd. from Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver. Placer Cego has
producing properties and exploration acreage principally in
British Columbia and Alberta. It also operates nine gas
producing plants.

   Cash-rich Placer Dome said the sale is expected to close
Sept. 27 and should generate a "favorable" special gain to
Placer Dome and inflate its cash holdings to more than C$1
billion, its spokesman said. He wouldn't estimate the size of
the gain.
   Placer Dome, a major gold producer, has never regarded oil
and gas as a core business. The company put all of its
Canadian and U.S. energy assets up for sale in December,
after receiving what it termed unsolicited expressions of
interest. In May, Placer Dome announced a pact to sell its
U.S. oil and gas unit, Houston-based Prairie Producing Co.,
to Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp., for $336 million including
assumed debt.
   "This is a fairly significant acquisition for Amerada
Hess," said Bruce Lazier, an analyst with Prescott Ball &amp;
Turben Inc., New York. Mr. Lazier said the purchase is part
of an aggressive expansion plan by Amerada, which last
September acquired a big package of oil and gas assets in the
Gulf of Mexico from an affiliate of Houston's Transco Energy
Co., for $886 million.
   Poco, a modest but fast-growing oil and gas producer, said
its share of the purchase price is C$31.1 million, and the
transaction will ultimately result in it acquiring interests
in several properties in British Columbia and Alberta.
