   WASHINGTON -- Citing a risk of poisoning, the
Environmental Protection Agency is banning mercury from
indoor paint and requiring outdoor paint that contains it to
carry warning labels.
   The requirements take effect Aug. 20. For paint already on
store shelves, the National Paint and Coatings Association is
working with manufacturers to place labels indicating that
any interior paint containing more than 200 parts per million
of mercury should be used only outside. While EPA officials
recommended at a briefing that consumers avoid paints with
mercury, the officials said consumers could safely use up
existing interior paint with less than 200 parts per million
of mercury as long as they ventilate thoroughly and minimize
exposure of children.

   Mercury is in 25% to 30% of all indoor latex paint to keep
it from spoiling while in the can. It's in about 20% to 35%
of all exterior latex paint to prevent mildew. Oil-based
paint doesn't contain mercury. Linda Fisher, an assistant EPA
administrator, said the industry will bear about $40 million
to $50 million in costs of reformulating paint, with
additional expense possible for manufacturers unable to sell
their existing stocks. For consumers, paint prices are likely
to rise about 1%.
   In a statement Friday, the paint association said it would
cooperate with the EPA, even though the association doesn't
believe "there is any scientific evidence to give consumers
any cause for alarm about use of interior products currently
on the market."
   The EPA became concerned about mercury in paint when a
four-year-old Michigan boy last year came down with a rare
form of poisoning, after paint containing mercury was used in
his home. Symptoms of this childhood mercury poisoning
include severe pain in the extremities, sweating and a rapid
heart beat. Other symptoms include slight tremors of the
hands, short-term memory loss and headaches.
   EPA officials urged people who have painted recently with
a mercury-containing paint to ventilate the area thoroughly.
The agency released a list of paint manufacturers that use
mercury and companies that don't. Consumers who want to know
whether a specific paint contains mercury can call
1-800-858-7378, a toll-free number at the National Pesticide
Telecommunication Network.
   The agency said it believes that the mercury concentration
in air decreases within a few days after painting, but that
lower concentrations may be present for months. People
wishing to dispose of paint containing mercury should consult
community hazardous-waste programs or local governments for
the proper ways to do so. Mercury shouldn't be poured down
drains, or into any bodies of water, since it is toxic to
many species, the EPA said.
   The EPA action results from a voluntary agreement worked
out with the companies that produce mercury for use in
paints. These companies are continuing to provide data that
the EPA will use to determine whether further action is
warranted for outdoor paint, or for such products as
spackling and joint compounds, which also contain mercury.
   Most pesticide uses of mercury were banned in 1976. At the
time, the agency allowed mercury's continued use in paint
because good alternatives weren't available.
