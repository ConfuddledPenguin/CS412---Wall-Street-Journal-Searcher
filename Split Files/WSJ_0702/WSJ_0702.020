   The companies are in the process of selling most of their
assets, and have retained Salomon Bros. Inc. to review a
possible sale of two Las Vegas, Nev., casino hotels. As
previously announced, the companies have agreed to sell 31
hotels to Park Plaza Inc., an affiliate of EIE International
Corp. of Japan.
   Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp. reported a
combined loss of $60.4 million, or $4.97 a share, for 1989.
The loss included a $55.8 million reserve for the planned
sale of certain properties.
   The two companies said their boards have adopted
amendments to the trustees' regulations and corporation
bylaws concerning the conduct of shareholder meetings. A
company spokeswoman said the changes include the
clarification of rules on shareholder proposals being
presented to the boards.
