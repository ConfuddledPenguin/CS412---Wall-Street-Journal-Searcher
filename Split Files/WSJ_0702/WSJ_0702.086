   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. filed a $100 million lawsuit
against Pathe Communications Corp., charging "willful, wanton
and malicious" breach of contract in the collapse of Time
Warner's agreement to bankroll half of Pathe's proposed $1.3
billion merger with MGM/UA Communications Co.
   The lawsuit, filed late Friday in California state court
in Los Angeles, provides new details of how Pathe's financing
fell apart and seems likely to cast new doubts on whether the
Los Angeles-based company can go through with the MGM/UA
deal. Time Warner's presence was widely considered to be the
most credible piece of Pathe's bid. But Pathe last week
declared an "impasse" in trying to persuade Time Warner to
ease restrictions on how much debt Pathe could take on and
said it would seek other sources of money.

   A Pathe spokesman said the company's lawyers hadn't
reviewed the suit and declined to comment. In Culver City,
Calif., MGM/UA officials, who aren't included in the
complaint, couldn't be reached for comment.
   The suit also may raise new questions about the
credibility of Pathe Chairman Giancarlo Parretti. It charges
that he signed an exclusive video-distribution deal with the
Warner Bros. studio only eight days after his company signed
a similar, supposedly exclusive deal with MGM/UA; and that,
after promising Warner exclusive theatrical rights to as many
as 40 Pathe films over the next five years, he deleted
Warner's name from the draft agreement and used the same form
to sign the same deal with MGM/UA.
   But Time Warner officials, eager to get distribution
rights to MGM/UA's coveted United Artists film library in
exchange for guaranteeing or putting up $650 million in Pathe
financing, apparently ignored the alleged double-dealings
even after discovering them.
   When Warner Bros. executives signed the video deal on
March 14, they expressly asked Mr. Parretti whether video
rights had been sold to anyone else, according to a person
involved in the Warner side of the dealings. Mr. Parretti
reportedly said no, even though Pathe had signed with MGM/UA
on March 6.
   Nor did Time Warner back out of the financing role it
agreed to on April 9 even after learning that the
distribution rights to the United Artists film vault -- lined
with the lucrative likes of James Bond and the Pink Panther
-- had been signed back over to MGM/UA as part of a revised
merger plan unveiled on June 21.
   The United Artists library was by far the most attractive
element for Time Warner, which is convinced that the control
of such entertainment "software" as movies, TV shows and
videocassettes is crucial to prevailing in the global
entertainment business. Rivals Paramount Communications Inc.
and MCA Inc.'s Universal studio are also said to have sought
the United Artists rights, after Pathe on March 6 first
offered to buy MGM/UA for an initial price of $1.2 billion.
   Warner studio officials didn't take action then, the
person close to Warner explains, because Pathe assured them
that the distribution conflict would be taken care of once
MGM/UA had been fully acquired. Time Warner finally filed
suit only after Pathe announced the impasse over debt
restrictions and when it appeared likely that, even if Mr.
Parretti defies the odds and finds enough funding to complete
the MGM/UA merger, Time Warner won't be part of it.
   Details in the lawsuit also make it clear that, even if
the Pathe-MGM/UA deal ultimately fails, one real winner will
emerge: MGM/UA Chairman and controlling shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian. His company would keep a non-refundable deposit of
$200 million in cash that Pathe has put down toward the
acquisition, and the distribution rights to the new Pathe
films, as well as old United Artists movies; plus another $75
million in film revenue from two pending Pathe pictures,
promised as collateral in the acquisition.
   Some of those provisions were imposed by MGM/UA when
Pathe, which has had trouble raising money to complete the
bid, revised the terms of its offer in June. The new pact
increased the original $20-a-share bid to $21.50 a share --
in essence paying Mr. Kerkorian and other MGM/UA shareholders
interest because of repeated delays in closing the deal.
Shareholders would receive $4 a share in cash by July 20,
drawn from the $200 million that Pathe already put up, and
would get the remaining $17.50 a share by Oct. 23.
   Indeed, now that MGM/UA can lay claim to the assets most
attractive to a prospective backer -- the United Artists
library and Pathe's future films -- it may be more difficult
for Pathe to line up a new partner.
   In New York composite trading Friday, MGM/UA closed at
$17.25, down 62.5 cents; Pathe, at $3.25, down 50 cents, and
Time Warner, at $100.50, down $1.875.
   The paths of Pathe and Warner Bros. first crossed in June
1989, when they began negotiating for Warner to distribute
Pathe films to U.S. theaters. By February 1990, the lawsuit
states, the two companies had reached an agreement, and
Warner had begun plotting media spending for three new Pathe
films, dickering over a publicity campaign with Tom Selleck,
the star of one of the films, "Quigley Down Under."
   The simple distribution deal turned into a complex -- and
high-risk-bankrolling agreement when Pathe made its bid for
MGM/UA a month later. Time Warner agreed, in essence, to
advance Pathe $650 million against future royalties, keeping
65% of the money taken in by Pathe films and passing the
other 35% to the combined Pathe-MGM/UA, as well as grabbing
the rights to some 1,000 United Artists movies.
   But Time Warner set a major condition for its $650 million
gamble: Pathe must come up with another $600 million by
selling equity rather than by taking on more debt. Some $450
million had to come from Pathe itself, and Mr. Parretti had
assured Time Warner that Pathe subsidiaries would provide the
cash. The other $150 million had to come from an outsider,
and officials in both companies looked to Mr. Kerkorian as
the likely source.
   But Time Warner later found that Pathe's Comfinance unit
in Europe had taken on debt to provide cash for the MGM/UA
deal. Some of the financing was extremely short-term -- such
as a $75 million loan that a Parretti travel subsidiary had
made, to be repaid in only seven days. And Mr. Kerkorian --
who rarely talks to the press -- so far has offered only $20
million rather than the hoped-for $150 million, a
Warner-related person says.
   Pathe tried to persuade Time Warner to lower the amount of
equity that the bidder would have to raise. But Time Warner
resisted, fearing that a debt-riddled Pathe/MGM would
collapse. That seems an unusual concern given Time Warner's
own sizable debt load of $10.6 billion. But the company
generates cash flow of $2.4 billion a year, while Pathe is
thinly capitalized and MGM/UA has been dormant in the film
business for much of the past year.
