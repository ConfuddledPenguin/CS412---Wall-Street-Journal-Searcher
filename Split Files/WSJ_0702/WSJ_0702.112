   Banknorth Group Inc., Burlington, Vt., said it plans to
add $5.2 million to its loan-loss reserve for the second
quarter.
   The company said it expects second-quarter earnings to be
in the range of 33 cents to 38 cents a share. In the year-ago
quarter, the company had net income of 69 cents a share --
restated in December after the concern merged with Howard
Bancorp, of Burlington, Vt.
