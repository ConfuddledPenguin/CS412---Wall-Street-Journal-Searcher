currency.

step toward political unification with the West and the
scrapping of internal borders. The West German mark became

Bonn's free-market system, taxes and social legislation,
ending 45 years of Soviet-inspired economic planning. In a
nationally televised address, West German Chancellor Kohl
promised that wealthy West Germany will do everything it can
to help get East Germany back on its feet, but that the
process won't be easy for all.
