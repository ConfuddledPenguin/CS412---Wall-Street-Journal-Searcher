   LONDON (AP) -- The London insurance market paid $344.5
million in settlement of the pollution cleanup from the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March 1989.
   The Institute of London Underwriters, which represents the
company marine insurance market, said it was the largest
single marine claim ever paid by the London insurance market.

   "Pollution cleanup resulting from the Exxon Valdez
disaster and agreement of the claim was finalized only
recently," said the institute's general manager, Peter
Worsfold.
   The money was paid to Thos. R. Miller &amp; Son (Reinsurance
Brokers) Ltd., representing the liability insurers who
incurred the loss for the cleanup, the institute said.
   Members of the institute paid $73.4 million, over 21% of
the total. Institute spokesman Denzil Stuart said the rest
was paid by Lloyd's of London underwriters and some European
insurers.
   The payment was made by electronic transfer through a new
computer system for claims management which connects all the
institute's companies and brokers.
   "Without the new computer technology, settlement of a
claim of this size and complexity, with the many interests
involved, would have taken much longer to process," Mr.
Worsfold said.
