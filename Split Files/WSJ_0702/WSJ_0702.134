   Mining house Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd.
said it has established a wholly owned offshore company to
hold its European interests.
   The establishment of the new company, A.E.H. Ltd., is
disclosed in the corporation's annual report. A spokesman
said the move was part of Anglo American's efforts to
position itself in Europe before the establishment of a
single European market in 1992.

   "Significant" investments made during the review year in
two European companies are held by A.E.H., the report said.
They are an effective 22.2% interest in Deutsche
Steinindustrie AG of West Germany, an international stone
operation, and an effective 19.7% of health-care company the
Medgenix Group of Belgium.
   The spokesman declined to comment on A.E.H.'s long-term
strategies.
   The investments in Europe form part of a total
1.123-billion-rand ($423 million) net expenditure by Anglo
American on investments during the past financial year, the
biggest of which was an increase to 25% in its stake in
mining house Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
