   WASHINGTON -- Farm prices in June dropped 1.3% from May,
largely as a result of weakening hog, wheat and soybean
prices, the Agriculture Department said.
   Although hog prices slipped $1 in June to $60.20 per
hundred pounds, they were still $15.10 higher than a year
ago, the department said. What's more, a June 1 survey of the
nation's inventory of hogs and pigs indicates that hog
producers can count on strong prices continuing into the
fall. Because of an unusually tight hog supply, meatpackers
could bid up prices even higher in coming weeks, according to
some analysts.

   For consumers, that portends continued high prices for
bacon and other pork products at stores. Glenn Grimes, a
University of Missouri agricultural economist, said he
expects retail pork prices to be 13% higher in August than a
year earlier.
   Cattlemen received an average beef cattle price of $74.20
per hundred pounds in June, down 20 cents from the previous
month but still $6.60 above the June 1989 average price,
according to the department's price report. Steers and
heifers also dropped 20 cents to $78.10 per hundred pounds,
while cow prices rose 30 cents to $53.80 per hundred pounds.
   Wheat prices averaged $3.15 a bushel, down 25 cents from
May, while rice averaged $7.03 per hundred pounds, down 18
cents. Corn prices averaged $2.69 a bushel, up seven cents
from May, while sorghum grain prices averaged $4.19 per
hundred pounds, up 15 cents. Soybean prices dropped 21 cents
in June to $5.75 a bushel.
   Fruit prices, led by plunging orange prices, fell 4.9%
from May, according to the department.
   In the hog markets, barrows and gilts averaged $61.10 per
hundred pounds and sows averaged $51 in June.
   The department estimated the national inventory of hogs
and pigs at 54.4 million on June 1, down 3% from a year ago
and from June 1, 1988.
   The breeding inventory totaled an estimated 7.2 million,
down 2% from last year and down 5% from two years ago,
according to the department's quarterly survey. The market
hog inventory was estimated at 47.2 million, down 3% from a
year ago and from June 1, 1988. Mr. Grimes said that if the
market hog inventory has been overestimated, as he suspects,
it will mean smaller hog marketings and stronger prices.
   The department said the nation's pig crop between December
1989 and May 1990 totaled 45.2 million, down 4% from the same
period a year ago and down 4% from two years ago.
   Hog producers intend to have 5.82 million sows farrow
between June and November, a 1% increase from the number of
sows farrowing during that period in 1989 but 4% fewer than
two years ago.
   In a separate report on spring planting, the department
said there has been significant expansion in acreage for
several crops from last year. Cotton acreage jumped 17% to
12.4 million acres, and rice acreage rose 5% to 2.7 million
acres, as Sun Belt farmers took advantage of relaxed
government limits on planting.
   Peanut growers, in the meantime, planted the largest
amount of acreage in 33 years -- 1.73 million acres, up 4%
from 1989 -- while tobacco farmers planted 725,000 acres, up
7%. Sugar beet growers increased their plantings by 6% to 1.4
million acres, according to the department. Much of the
expansion was in southern Minnesota and the Red River Valley
along the Minnesota-North Dakota border.
