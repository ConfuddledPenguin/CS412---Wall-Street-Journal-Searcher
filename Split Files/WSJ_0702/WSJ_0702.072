   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it is examining
charges by a former thrift regulator that the government
delayed closing Silverado Bank, Savings &amp; Loan, Denver, until
after the 1988 presidential election because Neil Bush, the
president's son, had been a board member.
   Kermit Mowbray, a former federal regulator in Colorado,
said that in the fall of 1988, his office received a phone
call ordering the regional regulators to delay closing
Silverado until after the November election. Mr. Mowbray, in
testimony before a congressional committee two weeks ago,
said he couldn't remember who made the call or who actually
received it.

   Washington S&amp;L regulators have claimed that the huge
number of insolvent S&amp;Ls caused a delay in closing dozens of
thrifts during that time, including Silverado. Losses at
Silverado are expected to total roughly $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which was made an arm of
the Treasury under the S&amp;L cleanup law, last week requested
the Treasury's inspector general to investigate the charges.
   Thrift regulators are currently pursuing an administrative
action against Neil Bush, charging that he didn't disclose
his business relationship with several large Silverado
borrowers while he was a director from 1985 to August 1988.
At a news conference last week, President Bush said he has
"full confidence in the integrity and honor of my son."
