   MILAN -- Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi lost
control of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. as shareholders
revoked his powers as chairman five months after he took the
helm at Italy's largest publishing group.
   The move was a victory for rival shareholder Carlo De
Benedetti, although the financier didn't assume control of
Mondadori. Shareholders named Giacinto Spizzico, a
representative of the Milan district court, as chairman of
the newly appointed board.

   The battle for control of the publishing house erupted in
December when the Formenton family revoked a pact with Mr. De
Benedetti and allied itself with Mr. Berlusconi. The
Formentons sold their 25.7% in AME Finanziaria S.p.A.,
Mondadori's parent company, to Mr. Berlusconi even though Mr.
De Benedetti held an option to buy the stake by the end of
January 1991.
   This move gave Mr. Berlusconi, himself a minority
shareholder of AME Finanziaria, majority control of Mondadori
and on Jan. 25, he had himself named chairman. Since then,
the disputed block of shares has been sequestered by the
court, which then took effective control of AME Finanziaria
last month and of Mondadori on Friday.
   Mr. Berlusconi and five representatives of his holding
company, Fininvest, were named to the new board. Mr. De
Benedetti received five seats on the new board, while the
court took four seats.
   The two sides have been negotiating a number of compromise
proposals, including one that calls for the break-up of the
publishing house. But talks have been deadlocked over which
party should get which assets at which price.
   Mondadori publishes Italy's leading daily newspaper, "La
Repubblica," the country's two top-selling weeklies, scores
of magazines, a dozen regional newspapers and some 2,500 book
titles a year. It posted consolidated revenue of around 2.4
trillion lire ($1.95 billion) in 1989.
