   NEW YORK -- Investors prospecting among depressed bank
stocks might do well to bring their picks and shovels to the
Midwest.
   More than their East and West Coast brethren, Midwest
banks have skirted the unholy trio of Third World loans,
leveraged buy-out loans and bad real estate loans.

   It's not that Midwest banks have avoided these loans
entirely. But they have generally made fewer of them and kept
loan portfolios diversified so that a few bad loans can't
sour the whole barrel. Many of them also have set aside ample
reserves to cover problem loans.
   "In general, the bankers in the Midwest are a more
conservative lot," says Kenneth F. Puglisi, an analyst with
Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, a securities firm specializing in
bank stocks. As for real estate, he says, "They didn't have a
boom, so they can't have a bust."
   Midwest banks may also be able to ride the economic
comeback of the Farm Belt. Large publicly traded banks make
relatively few agricultural loans, but they still benefit
when economic activity improves in their home territories.
   Despite these advantages, stocks of Midwest banks are
almost as depressed as other bank stocks. While the average
East Coast bank stock sells for a depressed 6.5 times the
company's expected per-share earnings for next year, the
average Midwest bank stock sells for a multiple of just 7.1,
according to Keefe Bruyette.
   J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst with Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, likes Detroit-based NBD and, to
a lesser extent, Norwest and First Bank System, both based in
Minneapolis.
   NBD, he says, is "probably the best in the country" at
avoiding bad loans.
   "NBD, which started in 1933 -- note the year -- has grown
up with a mentality to protect itself on credit quality," Mr.
Fredericks says. "It has never had a year since 1960" when
loan losses have exceeded 0.5% of loans outstanding, he says.
Less than 10% of its loan portfolio consists of real estate
construction loans or loans of more than $20 million.
   Norwest, Mr. Fredericks says, is "very healthy, very
clean." First Bank System has had problems but has changed
its management, contained costs and raised capital. "I
recommend it on a {dividend} yield basis," he says.
   More than a dozen brokerage houses are recommending Banc
One, Columbus, Ohio. Banc One has a history of product
innovation and seems to have deftly timed its entry into the
depressed Texas market. Whereas profit of $1 for each $100 of
assets is considered good for a bank, Banc One has often
managed to earn $1.40 for each $100.
   But Scott Black, president of Delphi Securities in Boston,
isn't a fan of Banc One shares; he feels the bank isn't
setting aside enough reserves for nonperforming loans. He
likes two other Midwest banks, First of America Bank in
Kalamazoo, Mich., and Manufacturers National in Detroit.
   First of America has "clean accounting," lends mainly to
small businesses and earns $1 for each $100 of assets, Mr.
Black says. Manufacturers National has a nice sideline in
helping companies with importing and exporting and is selling
for only six times this year's depressed earnings, he says.
   George Salem, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, cautions
against picking a bank just because it's in the Midwest. "I
don't think it's as simple as geography," he says. "The most
important thing is understanding the lending culture."
   Declines in real estate values still have a long way to
run, in Mr. Salem's view, even in the Midwest. "If this was a
baseball analogy, it would be the third or fourth inning," he
says, so "you need an extraconservative bank to withstand the
challenges."
   He thinks NBD fills that bill. His favorite, though, is in
Winston-Salem, N.C., not the Midwest. It's First Wachovia,
whose managers, he says, are "the high priests of prudent
lending." He isn't recommending Norwest, because of "some
overbuilding in the Twin Cities," and he rates Banc One only
a hold, he says, because of "a forecast rise in real estate
lending problems."
   Thomas H. Hanley of Salomon Brothers favors NBD and
Norwest. Both are on the bargain counter, he says. NBD's
price-earnings multiple is only about 62% of the market's
multiple, while Norwest's is only about 59%.
   Despite the operating improvements at First Bank System,
Mr. Hanley wouldn't buy the stock. "I think the company is
immune to the creation of shareholder value; it just seems
that they consistently have problems," he says. Nor would he
buy Banc One, even though its results have been good, because
it already trades at 80% of the market multiple.
   New York money manager Walter Kass of Curators Capital
Management favors First Interstate of Iowa, calling it a
financially strong bank that earns about $1.12 for each $100
of assets, mainly on home mortgage lending. And though he
likes its common, Mr. Kass thinks a better play is its
convertible bonds.
