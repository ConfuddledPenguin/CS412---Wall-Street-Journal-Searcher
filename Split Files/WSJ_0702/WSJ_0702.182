   Once-unthinkable events such as the reunification of
Germany and the release of Nelson Mandela may be unfolding
before our eyes, but the oft-proclaimed resurgence of small
stocks remains to be seen.
   Though this was supposed to be the year small stocks
rallied out of their seven-year siesta, they slumber on. Only
technology and emerging-growth stocks have advanced, leaving
behind other kinds of issues, both large and small.

   Analysts say they don't expect any change in this pattern
because investors are bidding up prices for predictable
earnings growth and recession resistance -- regardless of
size.
   "I don't think small is an advantage. Small is trouble. I
can't buy it, I can't sell it and the information is funny,"
says L. Keith Mullins, emerging growth analyst for Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   That hasn't kept Mr. Mullins from reaping the rewards of
125 "high octane" fast-growing companies included in the
Morgan Stanley Emerging Growth Stock Index. The companies
have an average market capitalization -- price times shares
outstanding -- of $225 million.
   The Morgan Stanley index is up 13% through Thursday,
compared with a 1.2% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index in
the first half and a mere 0.5% gain in the Russell index of
2,000 smaller stocks. Morgan Stanley, betting that
performance would continue, recently raised to 18% from 15%
the weighting of emerging-growth stocks in its model stock
portfolio.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which
regulates and operates over-the-counter trading through its
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system, brags that at mid-year Nasdaq is heading
toward the second-highest annual share and dollar volume in
its 20-year history. But though trading has been brisk in
some high-growth and technology issues, the activity hasn't
spread willy-nilly to other small stocks, analysts say.
   "We're still in a selective market, rather than a
broad-based rush to smallcaps {stocks}," says Jack Granahan,
comanager of the $300 million Vanguard Explorer Fund. Mr.
Granahan, who has followed small stocks since the late 1960s,
says 1990 isn't shaping up as a repeat of 1983, a year he
remembers for investors' "conceptual romancing" of smaller
issues.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler says he's
"being asked about good ideas; I'm not being pushed on
oneproduct, $3 stocks that will have no earnings five years
from now." Also absent, unlike 1983, are constant requests
for "hot tips," promotions of stocks already selling at high
multiples of per-share earnings, and a surge of initial
public offerings of marginal-quality stocks, Mr. Kessler
adds.
   In Bethesda, Md., former Washington Redskins center Dan
Ryczek says his outlook on small-cap stocks is bleak. Mr.
Ryczek, manager of the Rushmore Fund, also manages an OTC
Index Fund pegged to the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index of
largest OTC stocks. Since 1985, he says, the index has been
"excellent" at telegraphing market moves.
   "It's telling me to be careful here," Mr. Ryczek says,
noting the fund is up only 0.4% since Jan. 1. "It's telling
me we're late in the day rather than in a move to the
upside."
   Financial issues have had a dismal year as the savings and
loan crisis, sagging real estate markets and poor loan
portfolios have taken their toll on regional banks and
thrifts, notes John Powell, manager of the T. Rowe Price
Small-Cap Value Fund. The Nasdaq Financial Index is down
10.5% from year end.
   Mr. Powell also suggests that smaller stocks are being
shunned by strategists who rotate their investments among
stocks, bonds and cash, and who buy baskets of stocks rather
than individual shares. Such buyers demand liquidity, or the
ability to easily buy and sell stocks, which is lacking in
many smaller shares. "Trends are favoring liquidity in the
market," suggests Mr. Powell, who adds that trying to explain
the weak performance of small stocks "has been a fruitless
task."
   If the past is prelude, even this year's gains in emerging
growth and technology shares could fizzle. "Over the past
five years, if you had sold all of your {small-stock}
holdings on May 31 and retreated to the beach with a book to
sit out the remainder of the year, your annual return would
have averaged 17.4% versus a 12.7% gain for those poor stiffs
who slugged it out for the full year," Mr. Mullins wrote in a
recent report.
   "However," he added, "at the risk of being poorer and less
tanned, we are keeping our investment position relatively
intact."
   In general, investors seem to be favoring relatively new
companies that have gone public in the past five years and
shown consistent earnings growth, according to Mr. Mullins.
"Older companies have time to develop warts," he explains.
   His picks are shares of companies with an estimated annual
average growth rate of 26% over the next five years. On
average, the stocks trade at about 53% of their estimated
growth rate, or roughly 14 times estimated growth. By
comparison, he estimates the 500 stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's
index are trading at 141% of his projected 9% annual growth
rate-a rate he calls "very optimistic."
   Among the OTC stocks he recommends are Dynasty Classics, a
maker of lighting fixtures; Centex Telemanagement, which
manages telecommunications for small businesses; and
Healthcare Services Group, a provider of housekeeping and
laundry services to nursing homes.
   High on the list are several computer-related companies:
Linear Technology, a maker of integrated circuits; SynOptics,
a maker of local area networks for computers; Mentor
Graphics, which provides computer-aided engineering systems;
and Novell, a maker of personal computer network systems.
   Mr. Kessler of Shearson says he's searching for stocks
that weathered the 1981-82 recession or, if they didn't exist
then, are in recession-resistant businesses. "At Shearson, we
don't have `recession' in our vocabulary at this time, but
there is that risk," he says. He looks for companies with a
consistent 12% to 15% annual average growth rate, but not
highfliers that might "turn into a Roman candle and blow up."
   With an economic slowdown unmistakable in the second
quarter, Mr. Kessler is recommending stocks of a few
companies in the security business, such as Sensormatic
Electronics and Checkpoint Systems. If corporate revenues are
slowing, he explains, "the only way to protect the bottom
line is to prevent shoplifting or {inventory} `shrinkage.' "
   Shearson's forecasters also expect interest rates to ease,
he adds. "If that's the case, the combination of a sluggish
economy should bode well for stocks that can make it through
and produce earnings in a sluggish economy," Mr. Kessler
says.
