   GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Multimedia Inc. said it is redeeming
its subordinated redeemable discount debentures, due 2005, at
their $480 million face value, as part of a $1.1 billion
refinancing package.
   The newspaper, broadcasting and cable-television concern,
which issued the discount debentures as part of a
recapitalization in 1985, said its latest refinancing package
is composed of a $700 million bank facility and a $400
million private placement of unsecured senior notes.

   In addition to redeeming the debt, Multimedia said it will
use the proceeds from the refinancing to service its bank
debt and to create a pool of about $375 million for
acquisitions.
   Multimedia said its new credit agreements allow it to buy
back stock within certain limitations; it may do so based on
market conditions. The refinancing facilities provide an
overall interest rate of about 11%, the company said.
