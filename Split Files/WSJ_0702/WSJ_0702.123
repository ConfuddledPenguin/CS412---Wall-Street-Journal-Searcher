   WASHINGTON -- Honduras paid the World Bank $152.6 million
and the International Monetary Fund about $36 million to
clear up loan arrearage at the two international agencies.
   By making the payments, Honduras regains eligibility for
new loans from the two agencies. The World Bank announced the
payment Friday, and the IMF plans to make an announcement
today.

payments, are still on the World Bank's list of ineligible
borrowers, according to a bank official, who identified the

Syria and Zambia.
   The IMF has a list of nine countries with overdue loan
payments totaling about $4.4 billion. That list consists of
Cambodia, Liberia, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, the
