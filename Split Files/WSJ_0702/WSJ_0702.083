   NEW YORK -- An uncertain second half begins with eyes on
the June purchasing managers' index, which is expected to be
a tad weaker, and the employment report, which may be a bit
stronger.
   The purchasers' index, to be released today, is expected
to weigh in around 50.5%, according to MMS International, a
unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. The index, which was 50.7% in May,
has been hovering above the 50% benchmark for two months, and
is considered a significant gauge of manufacturing activity.
A reading above 50% generally indicates a growing
manufacturing sector, while a reading below 50% indicates a
slowdown.

   The broader jobs report, scheduled for release Friday, is
expected to be plumped a bit by several seasonal factors.
   The week's other indicators include May factory orders,
June auto sales, and May consumer credit.
   "Starting the second half, the economy looks weaker than
it did when we came into the year," Allen Sinai, chief
economist of Boston Co., said. "The sluggishness has spread
into more sectors." He noted that retail trade and finance
softened considerably in the first half.
   On the brighter side, Mr. Sinai noted that exports "are
holding up quite well," while the manufacturing sector has
lately shown signs of a pickup. But Mr. Sinai and others
warned that the factory activity may be related to an
anticipated auto workers' strike and building for inventory
that may or may not sell. So "The revival in manufacturing
may turn out to be a false alarm," Mr. Sinai said.
   The auto makers' June activity is expected to help keep
the purchasing managers' index above the benchmark 50% and
help stem slippage in manufacturing employment. The consensus
view expects June factory payrolls to lose 10,000 jobs,
compared with a loss of 35,000 positions in May. More
worrisome to economists is the slowdown in the growth of jobs
in the service sector -- the main engine of recent economic
growth.
   Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Corp.,
Pittsburgh, expects service-jobs growth of about 150,000 --
on the high end of expectations, but still weak in comparison
with last year. In 1989, the average monthly increase in
service jobs was about 200,000 positions.
   As the June reporting period covers five weeks and
includes the bulk of student hiring, Mr. Hoffman noted that
any weaker-than-expected numbers would be even more
significant. "The {June} bias is toward overstatement, so any
weakness would be understated," he said. "I'd worry if, over
a three-month period, we found {service} jobs averaging less
than 100,000 a month. That would be very weak."
   The unemployment rate is expected to inch ahead to 5.4%
from 5.3% in May, according to the consensus.
   Samuel Kahan, economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago,
said that estimating the number of service sector jobs is
difficult, at best, because "a good chunk of the figure is
really highly estimated." Nonetheless, the job count is worth
watching, he said. "We're finally seeing some deceleration in
employment growth. That should translate, over the next six
months or so, to a downward move on prides and wages," Mr.
Kahan said. The consensus view on average hourly earnings in
June calls for a 0.3% increase, down a bit from May's 0.4%
increase.
   May construction spending, to be posted today, is expected
to drop by about 1.2 percentage points, following declines of
0.7% each in March and April. And May factory orders,
scheduled for release tomorrow are expected to bounce back
from April's 2.3% decline with an increase of 2.1%, according
to consensus figures. The rebound is traceable to the
recently reported 3.9% increase in May durable goods orders.
