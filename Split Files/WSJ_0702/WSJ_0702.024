   JACKSON, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp's. Consumers Power Co.
unit asked regulators to approve an average 1.7% increase in
its electric rates to pay for the eventual decommissioning of
the utility's two nuclear power plants, Big Rock Point and
Palisades.
   The request, if granted, would produce approximately $36.2
million in additional revenue annually, to be placed in
external trusts for investment, CMS said.
