   Salt Lake City businessman Jon M. Huntsman received
federal approval to acquire up to 15% of troubled Ferro
Corp., a much-rumored takeover candidate last year, sending
Ferro stock surging $4.375 to $25.50 in heavy New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday.
   Brent Stevenson, president of Huntsman Holdings Inc., said
Mr. Huntsman didn't intend in the short term, either alone or
with someone else, to exercise control of Cleveland-based
Ferro.

   Mr. Stevenson said Mr. Huntsman already has an undisclosed
equity position in Ferro, which has 19.4 million common
shares outstanding.
   Ferro, which makes specialty chemicals, specialty ceramics
and engineered plastics, declined to comment. Earlier this
year, Mr. Huntsman failed to acquire another plastics-related
company, Aristech Chemical Corp., Pittsburgh.
   Separately, Ferro said it expects second-quarter earnings
to be "substantially lower" than the $13.1 million, or 87
cents a share, it earned a year earlier. The company's
first-quarter earnings plunged to $6 million, or 26 cents a
share, from $12.3 million, or 60 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Ferro said it expects second-quarter results to be better
than they were in the first quarter. It attributed its
problems to economic conditions in Latin America,
particularly Brazil, start-up costs for a new chemicals
operation in France, and sluggish demand in the automotive
market.
