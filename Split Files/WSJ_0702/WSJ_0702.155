   PITTSBURGH -- A foundation here plans to donate 100,000
acres of historic and ecologically sensitive land to the
federal government in what appears to be the largest such
gift ever.
   The land, which was acquired over the past two years for
$21 million, includes a 93,000-acre wildlife refuge in North
Carolina and the so-called "Cornfield" at Antietam National
Battlefield in Maryland, site of one of the bloodiest Civil
War battles.

   The gift by the Richard King Mellon Foundation is a rare
show of environmental philanthropy. Only 3.6% of all
foundation grant money goes to the environment, according to
the Foundation Center in New York, which tracks foundation
grants.
   The Mellon Foundation, a leader in environmental
philanthropy, purchased the properties through The
Conservation Fund, an Arlington, Va.-based non-profit group.
The fund selected the land from a government list of
ecological and historical properties, many of which were
threatened by commercial development. The conservation
organization benefited from a sluggish real estate market,
but often found itself competing with land developers.
   The fund, for example, paid $8.8 million for the
93,000-acre wildlife refuge in Alligator River, N.C.,
outbidding a group of Japanese investors who wanted to mine
the land.
