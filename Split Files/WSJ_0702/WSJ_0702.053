   In an episode of "L.A. Law," attorney Michael Kuzak found
himself in an ethical quandary for suppressing the fact that
his opposing counsel in a big case wasn't a lawyer. It took
just a week for the California state bar to suspend him.
   In reality, lawyer discipline hasn't been nearly that
swift or effective, but it is getting better. Under pressure
from consumers, judges and even a few reform-minded lawyers,
state bars from California to Florida have toughened their
discipline acts over the past two years.

   Consider: Last year, the California bar boosted its
discipline spending 75% to $33.4 million and added a
full-time court devoted exclusively to discipline matters;
Illinois has added some non-lawyers to its discipline
process, and opened to the public hearings that used to be
closed-door -- just in time to hear a case against the
president of the Chicago Bar Association. In January, a
federal judge invalidated a Florida bar rule that treated
lawyers like kings by threatening to jail consumers who
voiced complaints about attorneys in public. A month later,
the state Supreme Court approved even broader changes.
   New Jersey is already seeing benefits of tough new
standards for lawyers: Between 1984 and 1989, while the
number of dues-paying attorneys in the state rose about 50%,
the number of total complaints filed against them actually
declined.
   New Jersey lawyers "have the benefit of a rule that is
certain," says Raymond Trombadore, the chief of New Jersey's
lawyer discipline agency. Adds James Fox Miller, president of
the Florida Bar, "Short of perfection, {the system} is
getting better and better."
   But as the reprimands escalate, so do objections from
within the ranks of attorneys. Indeed, a growing number of
lawyers accused of misconduct, along with their defenders,
seem to think that the system is becoming increasingly rigged
against them.
   "They're being jerks," says Arthur Margolis, a Los Angeles
defense lawyer and a former state-bar prosecutor, referring
to California's state bar disciplinarians. Some attorneys
argue that lawyers accused of misconduct are being denied
their constitutional rights, while others voice concern about
how lawyers are turning in each other in what one calls a
"Hitler-youth type scenario." Still others say
disciplinarians lack sensitivity to lawyers with alcohol or
drug dependencies, which are behind as many as 40% of the
customer complaints.
   Of course, many people believe lawyers remain an overly
protective order when it comes to disciplining themselves.
Only a small fraction of complaints lodged against lawyers
ever result in formal discipline, and getting outright
disbarred remains no easy task. Local bars generally continue
to control the discipline process, and they admit that some
of the biggest gripes about lawyers, such as their
competence, remain outside the scope of such proceedings.
   Mostly, discipline is meted out for the grossest forms of
misconduct, such as stealing client funds. Nevertheless, more
people than ever are filing complaints against lawyers. HALT,
a Washington, D.C., legal reform group, estimates that 93,000
complaints were filed against lawyers in 1988, compared with
about 70,000 in 1985.
   Concern about inadequate funding for discipline has
prompted the American Bar Association to commission a hard
look at the subject. The last time the ABA did that, in 1970,
the system was declared "powerless, antiquated and
scandalous." In February, when the latest commission held a
public hearing in Los Angeles, "we got 200 people who wanted
to tell us their horror stories," recalls Mr. Trombadore, the
New Jersey discipline chief and a member of the panel. "Some
people came 800 to 900 miles" to complain.
   "I have totally lost confidence in the ability of the
state bar to discipline its members," gripes Barry Silberg, a
Santa Rosa, Calif., plastic surgeon who says he filed a
complaint against his ex-wife's lawyer in a divorce
proceeding, but saw it dismissed without explanation. "I
think the bar is essentially a marketing organization in this
state," he adds.
   Some California lawyers, though, think the reality is much
harsher. Last year, California's Supreme Court upheld a law
that empowers the bar to temporarily suspend lawyers even
before their discipline cases have been finally adjudicated.
Defense lawyers had complained that the law was
unconstitutional because it deprived the accused of due
process of law. The bar used the new authority to suspend
about 20 lawyers last year.
   Mr. Margolis, the Los Angeles defense lawyer, complains
that the bar is "overreacting." This spring, one of his
clients, celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, admitted
to seven ethical violations, including failing to promptly
return unearned fees to clients. His name, though, was tarred
with more serious charges that could have led to disbarment
-- such as stealing from clients -- only to have the bar drop
those charges, according to Mr. Margolis. State bar officials
say they aren't finished with Mr. Mitchelson, however, and
recently filed new charges that he misappropriated client
trust accounts. Of the new charges, Mr. Margolis asserts:
"They were drafted as poorly as the prior ones, and it is
clear there has been an inadequate investigation."
   Other California attorneys are alarmed at what they
consider to be an unsympathetic view of lawyer misconduct
stemming from drug or alcohol abuse.
   Lawyer David Demergian concedes that he had problems when
California's state bar court last year recommended that he be
disbarred for misappropriating $25,000 from client trust
accounts. According to court records, during a three-day
period in June 1985, "he used three and one-half ounces of
cocaine, pointed a loaded gun at his fiance and a friend, and
expressed a desire to kill his former secretary." But Mr.
Demergian, who admitted to a cocaine problem, sought
leniency, arguing that he had paid back the stolen funds,
become active in rehab programs, and had 67 letters of
support from judges, attorneys and clergy. No dice. The
California Supreme Court upheld the disbarment order.
   "Do you kill him or give him a chance to rehabilitate
himself?" asks Ted Cohen, a Los Angeles lawyer who defends
lawyers in substance-abuse cases. "They are just coming down
too hard on these people."
   A 1988 Illinois Supreme Court decision requiring lawyers
to turn in each other for ethical lapses has also drawn major
fire. The case involved a lawyer who spent some settlement
money he won for a client. The client hired a second attorney
to get the money back. That second lawyer was suspended for a
year for failing to notify the state bar after learning of
the first lawyer's misappropriation.
   "Lawyers can be faulted for a lot of things, but the
profession has historically treated the attorney-client
relationship in a very special way," says Warren Lupel, a
Chicago legal defense lawyer. "This {rule} kind of breaches
that. It is creating a Hitler-youth type scenario." Mr. Lupel
says the case prompted more than 900 such lawyer vs. lawyer
complaints last year.
   Illinois lawyers, he adds, are being asked by the state
bar to respond to complaints about their phone demeanor or
for neglecting messages. "If I notified a state agency in
Illinois that a doctor was not returning my phone call, they
would laugh and hang up," Mr. Lupel says.
   Nevertheless, states are plowing ahead with tough reforms.
Last year, the number of lawyers punished by the California
state bar jumped 44%; a once-huge backlog of unresolved
complaints is rapidly being whittled down. New Jersey now
randomly audits attorney finances and automatically disbars
attorneys who steal from their clients. Unlike most states,
New Jersey also prohibits disbarred attorneys from seeking
reinstatement.
   Dominic Aprile, a Newark, N.J., defense lawyer, says that
the changes have come at the expense of lawyers'
constitutional rights. Lawyers facing discipline have more at
stake than, say, a person charged with petty crimes, but have
far fewer legal protections, he believes.
   Mr. Trombadore, the New Jersey discipline-agency chief,
disagrees, saying: "The deterrent effect outweighs the
occasional hardship that might be generated in a case that
cries out for mitigation."
