   CUPERTINO, Calif -- Apple Computer Inc. said it will keep
its Claris software unit, scrapping plans to sell it off
through a public stock offering.
   As previously reported, Apple decided to retain Claris,
which makes applications software for Apple's computers, to
help insure a flow of improvements to both application and
systems software.

   Systems software, which controls the basic operations of a
computer, is considered a major strength of Apple's
computers, which are widely believed to be easy to use. But
this year competing makers of personal computers have been
able to make their machines easier to use with the help of a
new version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
   Industry observers suspect Apple's sudden desire to retain
Claris, which spent much of this year planning an initial
public offering, is a response to the new version of Windows,
released in late May.
   "That isn't so," said William Campbell, Claris's chief
executive officer. "This decision will elicit some negative
responses, but, over time, people will realize that Apple's
intent wasn't to panic about Windows."
