   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A dissident shareholder group in
Lionel Corp., expressing frustration with the toy retailer's
management, said it had begun to consider steps it might take
in an effort to boost the value of the company.
   The group, led by Trendex Capital Management, previously
has sought to press Lionel to find a buyer. The Trendex
group, which holds 5% of Lionel, said it amended its filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect its
wish to get greater accountability from Lionel executives and
an increase in the company's share value. It cited repeated
efforts by "Trendex. . . .other shareholders and the news
media" to get answers about the company's low market value,
"business practices and poor results," all to no avail.

   Lionel officials couldn't be reached for comment on
Friday.
   Earlier this year, Lionel rejected investor Robert I.
Toussie's offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million. Since then,
the stock has gradually declined; it closed Friday at $2.75,
up 37.5 cents, in trading on the American Stock Exchange.
   Recently, the company reported a wider fiscal
first-quarter loss of $6 million, or 44 cents a share,
although sales were up 7.5% to $65.9 million. The company
cited reduced sales at existing stores and the expenses
involved in opening new stores.
