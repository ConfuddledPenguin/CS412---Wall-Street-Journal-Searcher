   Washington, D.C. -- As art prices rise, so does interest
in collectors of art. This has been reflected in a number of
recent museum exhibitions devoted to private collections,
many of which specialize in pricey late 19th-century
paintings.
   The most recent of these is "The Passionate Eye:
Impressionist and Other Master Paintings From the Collection
of Emil G. Buhrle," which will be at the East Wing of the
National Gallery of Art until July 15.

   This is an impressive exhibition, which brings together 85
pictures from both the E.G. Buhrle Foundation and the Buhrle
family private collection.
   It is well worth a trip to Washington, since these
paintings are not expected to travel again after this show
completes its tour and there are some real gems here.
   Moreover, until Aug. 5 the West Wing of the National
Gallery is hosting another temporarily peripatetic first-rate
private collection, "Masterpieces of Impressionism and
Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection" (reviewed in
these pages last Aug. 4).
   Although the main strength of the Buhrle collection is in
its modern paintings, it also includes some lovely old
masterworks. One of the most impressive of these is G.B.
Tiepolo's "Diana Bathing" (circa 1755-60), a theatrical
composition of frolicking female nudes that is as lush and
sensuous as a Boucher.
   There also are some lovely landscapes. Aelbert Cuyp's
"Thunderstorm over Dordrecht" (c. 1645) is dominated by a
brooding sky streaked with magnificently rendered lightning,
and two evocatively detailed views of Venice by Canaletto
nearly transport you to the place itself.
   The modern paintings are divided into two sections, one
exhibited in the softly lit lower galleries and the other in
the brighter galleries upstairs. This produces a curious
effect. Although some of the artists, such as Monet, are
represented in both places, the pictures in the downstairs
galleries look more "old master" -- like as a result of the
warmer lighting, while the pictures upstairs seem a bit more
brash.
   The taste behind the Buhrle collection is a very
particular one, preferring toughminded, somewhat austere
works. A number of the pictures have offbeat subjects.
Manet's "La Sultane" (1871) is a frankly sensual portrayal of
a plump, rather melancholy prostitute dressed in diaphanous
Middle Eastern garb.
   A little further on, the same painter's sketchily rendered
"The Suicide" (1881) is morbidly haunting. Toulouse-Lautrec's
"The Two Friends" (1895) is an unusually forthright
representation of two lesbians making love. And his majestic
"Messaline" (1900), painted while he was recovering from a
severe breakdown, is a chillingly somber, almost funereal
evocation of an operetta about the Emperor Claudius's
nymphomaniac wife.
   The collection also contains a number of stunning
Cezannes, including the mysteriously brooding "Boy in the Red
Vest" (1890) and the sonorously austere "SelfPortrait With
Palette" (1890), one of Cezanne's greatest representations of
himself.
   There also are a half-dozen powerful van Goghs, three of
which are truly sublime. A superb variation of the "Sower"
(1888) balances the dark silhouettes of a striding man and a
bowing tree against a sky the color of hammered gold. In the
tumultuous "Wheat Field With Cypresses" (1889), the whole
ensemble is tossed and tumbled by an apocalyptic wind. The
lyrical "Blossoming Chestnut Branches" (1890), by contrast,
is a paragon of almost other worldly serenity.
   If the 20th-century paintings are not of the same high
quality, there nevertheless are some wonders, such as
Kandinsky's poetic "Blue Rider" (1903) and two Braques, one a
brightly colored fauve landscape, the other a mysteriously
suggestive cubist work.
   Both the Buhrle and Annenberg collections are accompanied
by well-illustrated and informative but tellingly different
catalogs. While the Annenberg catalog focuses solely on the
collection, the Buhrle catalog pays much attention to the
collector. In fact, the show is billed as a commemoration "of
the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Swiss
industrialist and collector Emil G. Buhrle."
   Nothing wrong with this, you might say, as you thumb
through the lengthy essay about the collector and glance at
the photographs of him, his family, his friends, his house,
his factory. For neither the catalog nor any of the other
printed matter that accompanies it bothers to point out that
the man being lionized here was blacklisted in 1945 for
delivering arms to the Germans during World War II, and that
his son Dietrich, who succeeded him in the business, later
lost his commission in the Swiss Army, as a convicted felon,
for illegal arms sales.
   Now while it is perfectly legitimate to exhibit such a
man's collection, it seems to me downright tasteless to
sanctify him the way this catalog does. I do not mean to
suggest that only works of art that have belonged to
blameless men should be shown in museums. (Since, among other
reasons, this would not leave much to show.) But I do think
that when museums present such collections, they might take
their cue from Walter Annenberg. Though he might not win many
popularity contests, he at least has had the good taste to
keep his collection and his private life separate, and to
refrain from using the one to justify the other.
   After it leaves Washington, the Buhrle collection will be
seen at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Aug. 3-Oct. 14; the
Yokohama Museum of Art, Nov. 2-Jan. 13, 1991; and the Royal
Academy of Arts, London, Feb. 1-April 9, 1991. The Annenberg
collection will be seen at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, Aug. 16-Nov. 11; and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York, May-September 1991.
