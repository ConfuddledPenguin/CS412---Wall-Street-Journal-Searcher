   TORONTO -- Holders of Dylex Ltd. approved the
authorization of a new class of convertible preferred shares
that could be used instead of cash to pay off 150 million
Canadian dollars (US$128.4 million) of debentures
outstanding.
   Holders of the 9.25% debentures can retract them at 110%
of their face value in 1992. The retailing company can ill
afford such a cash outlay. Dylex had losses of C$10.5 million
for the quarter ended May 5 and C$60.7 million for the fiscal
year ended Feb. 3. But the company has the option of
substituting the new securities for cash.

   Wilfred Posluns, chairman and chief executive officer,
said Dylex nevertheless would like to avoid issuing the newly
authorized shares, because they could dilute the company's
widely held Class A nonvoting shares, into which the
preferred would be convertible.
   He said Dylex might consider raising cash through the sale
of a division or real estate, share issues by a division, or
borrowing against real estate. But he said no specific plans
had been made for any of these measures.
   In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dylex
Class A shares closed unchanged at C$3.95 (US$3.38).
