   Ask Dan Quayle what it's like to be a non-practicing
lawyer in an administration whose official position is that
"everyone ought to take every opportunity to blast lawyers"
and don't expect any dissent. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater attracted the wrath of the organized bar for his
Bush-backed fighting words earlier this year, but it's the
nation's top elected lawyer who makes the more specific, more
damning indictment of a criminal- and civil-justice system on
the skids.
   In a recent interview, Vice President Quayle said he'd put
law reform at the top of his agenda. He had just given a
tough speech in Denver to the National Sheriffs' Association
-- "Punishment is not unseemly revenge, punishment is a
civilized approach to wrongdoing." A relaxed Mr. Quayle came
to the back row of Air Force Two to speak at length on issues
from the exclusionary rule, to the unpredictability of
business law, to whom he might suggest for the Supreme Court
(hint: The nominee's name will be familiar).

   Crime is a new theme in Mr. Quayle's speeches. "People are
more alarmed today about crime and drugs than they ever have
been before," he says. "When you get beyond the big issues of
war and peace or job security, they're looking at their
individual security and they can see the tremendous increase
in the crime rate. The statistic I use in my speeches is
rather shocking, that you're more apt to be a victim of a
violent crime than you are to be injured in a traffic
accident."
   Who's to blame? Judges, for one. "It's very difficult to
try to understand some court decisions," Mr. Quayle says,
citing procedural rules that suppress evidence from criminal
juries. "Lifetime appointments for judges give them a certain
immunity from what may be perceived as common sense."
   Congress, for another. "We've met with a modest brick wall
in the Congress thus far on the crime bill. But I can assure
you that the American people are on the side of giving law
enforcement a break where there is a good-faith exercise of
reasonableness as compared to very liberal interpretations as
to what the Fourth Amendment really says. The exclusionary
rule needs to be modified because it just allows gaping
loopholes for crafty lawyers to spring defendants loose. It's
time we care more about victims' rights than we do criminals'
rights."
   He noted that a decade ago it was "considered quite chic"
to oppose the death penalty, but now even the Democratic
nominee for governor in California, Dianne Feinstein, is a
big backer. "Some of the worn cliches from the liberal
sociologists are just wrong. If money were the answer, we'd
have less crime today rather than more," he said. Instead in
speeches he cites drugs and the breakdown of the family
noting that violent crime in the U.S. has quadrupled since
1960 while during the same period in Japan violent crime fell
to one-quarter its earlier level.
   Our legal system punishes criminals too rarely, but often
sticks civil defendants with huge unexpected liabilities. "We
are a litigious society, we have more lawyers per capita than
any other country in the world," Mr. Quayle notes. "Sometimes
we get bogged down in interpretations and reinterpretations,
with lawyers going at an issue from 15 different ways and
coming to no agreement at all."
   Perhaps the only predictable trend in our law is to
greater liability for damages. "We're trying to look for ways
to take burdens off the private sector so that it can go out
and compete. The product liability laws in this country are
ridiculous. There's no sense of certainty, there are no
limitations. This uncertainty adds considerably to the cost
of products. There are tremendous disincentives for starting
up a business. If you look at comparative disadvantages with
other countries, product liability must rank right up there
as one of the premier candidates."
   The cause of the problem? "Somehow there's this idea that
if someone has deep pockets, just let them pay and it's going
to be a freebie. Where there's a wrong there should be a
remedy, but the system has got to the point where you have
outrageous awards where negligence is not proven, the statute
of limitations is nonexistent and there's no understanding of
what your liability might be."
   Mr. Quayle also knows that with new environmental and
other regulations the Bush administration risks fanning these
litigation flames. He runs a competitiveness council within
the White House that's supposed to keep an eye on ambiguous
or otherwise burdensome regulations. "The president gave me
this task because he sensed that many regulations he got off
the books {as head of President Reagan's deregulation
committee} are coming back on."
   Finally, how about Supreme Court nominees? "The left felt
that Robert Bork would have too much influence on the court.
They felt with his intellectual firepower combined with a
couple of others there that the intellectual balance on the
Supreme Court would really be tilted to the conservative
point of view," Mr. Quayle says.
   "They gave all sorts of other reasons, but when it came
down to it they saw a man who was quite capable, willing to
be forceful and who had a way with a pen. It's a real tragedy
that he's not on the court. But, who knows?" Is that a hint
that a President Quayle might renominate Mr. Bork? "He
certainly has the qualifications."
   Mr. Quayle seems at ease discussing these issues and even
more arcane subjects such as proposals to make losers of
lawsuits pay the winner's legal fees as a way to cut
frivolous cases (he's interested but noncommittal). He has
surrounded himself with the makings of an excellent legal
debating club, including three of the four founders of the
Federalist Society, the conservative-libertarian law group:
Deputy Chief of Staff Spencer Abraham, Deputy Counsel David
McIntosh and speech writer Steven Calabresi (the fourth, Lee
Liberman, is a lawyer for President Bush).
   Mr. Quayle could do himself the favor of developing some
"gravitas" if he could elevate legal reform to a higher place
in our politics. It's about time someone did. Congress has
held up an anti-crime bill for more than a year. An
administration-backed product liability bill is going
nowhere. The political dividends could be large indeed for
someone willing to say how much has turned rotten in our
legal system, especially if he's in a position to do
something about it.
