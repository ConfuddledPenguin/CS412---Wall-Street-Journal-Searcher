   Klutzy Robots Beware:
   A New Crew Has Grace

   ELBOW ROOM has been a problem for robots. But a Yale
University engineer has developed a robotic arm that can
outperform humans in cramped spaces.
   Using tiny computers and hundreds of sensors, the arm
maneuvers around objects, taking the most efficient course to
perform a task.
   Vladimir Lumelsky, associate professor of electrical
engineering and the developer of the arm, says the technology
may revive interest in robots, which has faded in the past
few years as factories' expectations were dashed. Doing only
repetitive tasks, robots often smashed objects around them
and required more space than the humans they replaced.
   The eight-foot Lumelsky robot arm is made of flexible
plastic. It has 500 glass-covered sensors, each of which
sends out a beam of infrared light 20 times a second. The
beams bounce off objects that come within five to six inches
of the arm, and receptors in the sensors send the information
about obstacles to tiny computers in the arm that plan
evasive actions.
   Mr. Lumelsky believes the technology can be improved even
further. He says the next generation of robotic arms, which
he's now developing with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan, will have
thousands of sensors and will be able to respond to obstacles
20 inches away. Robots eventually will be able to perform
delicate assembly tasks, work side by side with humans, and
pick up apples without bruising them, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Beam of Light Measures
   Brain Oxygen in Surgery
                                                                                                       

   RESEARCHERS at the University of Pennsylvania are testing
a noninvasive sensor technology that monitors oxygen levels
in a patient's brain during surgery.
   The brain can be damaged when the oxygen carried by the
blood drops below a critical level and isn't restored within
minutes. Doctors currently monitor the patient's oxygen
levels by measuring the intake of oxygen by the lungs and the
saturation of hemoglobin in the arterial blood. This approach
assumes that if the body's levels are good, then the brain is
receiving adequate levels of oxygen.
   But the researchers say current techniques aren't
completely reliable in surgery. Directly measuring oxygen
levels of the brain "can make a difference" in the operating
room, they say. "It can alert the surgeon and
anesthesiologist earlier than the existing techniques do,"
says Britton Chance, a professor of biochemistry and physics
and the developer of the device.
   The sensor, the size of a tape recorder, uses light and
detectors to pick up changes in blood oxygen in the brain.
White light is transmitted through the skin and skull to the
brain and reflected back to a coin-size detector. Changes in
light absorption indicate the oxygen levels in the brain; a
drop in absorption signals falling oxygen levels.
   Mr. Chance says other uses include monitoring oxygen
levels in an athlete's muscles to prevent intense muscle pain
that results from oxygen depletion.
                                                                                                       

   Work and Diet Affect
   Point of Colon Cancer
                                                                                                       

   OCCUPATION as well as diet may determine where cancer will
show up in the colon, medical researchers find.
   The five-foot-long organ has three sections, each of which
has a different blood source and moves differently during the
digestive process. "Consequently, the sections have different
susceptibilities," says David H. Garabrant, associate
professor of occupational medicine at the University of
Michigan, which conducted the study along with the University
of Southern California.
   Looking at 294 men, ages 24 to 44, all with colon cancer,
it appeared that a person with a sedentary job, such as an
executive, stands a greater chance than others of developing
a cancerous tumor in the midsection of the colon that runs
across the abdomen and down the left side. Men whose
occupations exposed them to metal and wood dusts had a higher
risk of cancer in the rectum and the sigmoid or lower colon.
   A diet heavy in deep-fried foods or meats preserved with
nitrite -- such as ham and smoked meats -- was associated
with cancer in the right colon. Mr. Garabrant says fresh
fruits, vegetables, and fibers seemed to reduce the chances
of developing colon cancer, but not rectal cancer.
   Jobs with physical activity also seemed to protect men
from colon cancer, particularly in the transverse and
descending portions.
                                                                                                       

   Scientists Concentrate
   On a Mix to Make Milk
                                                                                                       

   TWO U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists have
developed a frozen milk concentrate.
   The dairy industry hasn't had much success in coming up
with a product similar to the frozen orange-juice
concentrate. That's because the butterfat in milk decomposes
easily and is thus hard to reconstitute. George Bookwalter
and Steven Lyle, the two Agriculture Department scientists,
overcame the problem by substituting butterfat with oil of
soybean, corn, or peanut -- bringing a side benefit of making
the milk cholesterol-free.
   The pair got the idea from a practice common in developing
nations, where dry milk is often mixed with oil as well as
water, to increase the caloric value. The researchers say
they have developed a blending technique that prevents oil
and water separation, and add that several U.S. companies are
looking into the prospects of commercializing the
U.S.D.A.-patented technology.
   A pint of concentrate yields two quarts, says Mr. Lyle,
who adds: "A lot of people can't tell the difference between
the reconstituted and whole milk."
