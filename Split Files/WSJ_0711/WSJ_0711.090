   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The cost of living in West
Germany in June rose 0.1% from the previous month and 2.3%
from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said in
reporting final data for last month.
   The data are based on figures received from all 11 West
German states and are in line with preliminary indications,
based on reports from the four largest states, published at
the end of June.

   Last month's increase in living costs is similar to that
for April, up 0.2% from March and 2.3% from a year earlier.
The data showed only moderate inflationary pressures in the
run-up to German monetary and economic unification on July 1.
   The June cost-of-living index, in which 1985 prices equal
100, edged up to 106.8 from 106.7 in the previous month and
104.4 in June 1989.
