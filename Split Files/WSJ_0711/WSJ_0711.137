   Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill., citing
"continued productivity improvement, higher volume and better

reported second-quarter earnings of $240.2 million, or 55
cents a share, up from $212.6 million, or 48 cents, a year
earlier. Per-share figures reflect a decrease in shares
outstanding to 437.1 million from 447.8 million.
