   TIMONIUM, Md. -- Kirschner Medical Corp. said it settled
all legal disputes with ALM Equipment Hospitaliers S.A., a
former supplier of surgical lights to Kirschner's Chick
division.
   Although terms of the settlement were not disclosed,
Kirschner said the agreement ends the company's liabilities
to ALM, and it will allow Kirschner to recover about $1.76
million from reserves previously established for those
liabilities.
