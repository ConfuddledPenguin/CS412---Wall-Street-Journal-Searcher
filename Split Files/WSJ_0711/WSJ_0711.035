   As I read Tim W. Ferguson's profile on Sam Steiger,
Arizona's colorful candidate for governor ("A Libertarian
Governor?" editorial page, June 18), I noticed one inaccuracy
about the University of Arizona (as well as Arizona State
University).
   Enrollment at the UA is not 40,000 as reported; the total
count as of fall 1989 is 35,569. Enrollment at ASU is 43,546
as of last fall, not 65,000. Enrollment management is one of
UA President Henry Koffler's top priorities, and he has
adopted a plan to limit enrollment to 38,000 between now and
1995.

   However, the challenge of educating the state's young
people is a major concern for universities and community
colleges alike. High-school graduates in Arizona will
increase from 31,000 in 1990 to 43,000 in 2000, based on the
number of students currently enrolled in our elementary
schools.
