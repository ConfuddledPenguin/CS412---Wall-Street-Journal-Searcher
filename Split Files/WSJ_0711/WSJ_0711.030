   BEIJING -- China's industrial production, responding to an
infusion of bank credit, shot up 5.9% in June from a year
earlier, the newspaper China Daily reported.
   With June's strong showing, industrial output for the 1990
first half was 2.2% above the year-earlier period and totaled
925.4 billion yuan ($196.5 billion).

   However, the state statistical bureau warned that industry
will have to maintain an 8% growth rate in the second half of
the year to fulfill the state plan, the official Xinhua news
agency reported. The plan projected an annual growth rate of
6%.
