   Noxso Corp., Pittsburgh, said it received a patent for a
process to remove sulfur and other pollutants from coal-fired
power plants. The company's sole business is the development
and commercialization of this pollution-control technology.
   Noxso said the patent is the last of three covering its
process to remove sulfur and nitrogen oxide from burning
high-sulfur coal. The process involves the use of absorbent
beads made from aluminum oxide and coated with sodium. The
latest patent covers the regeneration stage of the process,
which chemically treats the materials used so they can be
reused, Noxso said.
