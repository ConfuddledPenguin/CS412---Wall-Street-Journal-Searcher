   When Osaka Waterfront Development Co. opens its $148
million waterfront project in Osaka, Japan, next week, a
small design company halfway around the world will get much
of the credit.
   The Cambridge, Mass., company, Cambridge Seven Associates
Inc., designed not only the project's centerpiece, a $107
million aquarium, but also the adjoining marketplace. And it
produced the master plan for the whole development project.

   Cambridge Seven, which counts aquarium design as one of
its specialties, first planned a 1.4 million-gallon tank for
Pacific marine life, from Alaskan sea otters to Panamanian
eels. Then, principal architect Peter Chermayeff and his
associates designed the specialty marketplace for stores and
restaurants that reflected a diverse international theme. "We
even taught the bartenders how to make the perfect daiquiri,"
Mr. Chermayeff says. His father, Serge, is a well-known
architect and a former professor of design at Yale
University.
   As the design business gets more specialized, concerns
such as Cambridge Seven increasingly reach beyond their
conventional services and act as entrepreneurial catalysts.
Instead of simply designing an attraction such as the Osaka
aquarium, they plan whole commercial and development projects
built around the attraction. They benefit from leveraging a
specific expertise. Precious few people know what it takes to
build a commercial success around an aquarium, for example.
   This broad development strategy helps the design concerns
diversify and increase their income. It also gives them a big
role in shaping the small-business opportunities in
marketplace projects built around tourist and recreational
attractions.
   Besides providing traditional blueprints, design firms
that act as catalysts often offer market analysis,
environmental-impact studies, management reports and even
operating manuals. They must combine their expertise in
design with broader operational and economic concerns, says
Alfred Osborne, entrepreneurial studies director of the
University of California at Los Angeles. "The trick is to
make these services available at a low enough cost."
   The broad approach is spreading. "We're going beyond
design. Our role has broadened enormously," says Grant Jones,
a principal at Jones &amp; Jones Inc., a Seattle design firm that
specializes in designing and redesigning zoos. "We're less an
office of artists and designers and more of a design
company," he adds.
   Demand for the designer as catalyst has grown as cities
have learned the power of a tourist attraction as a focal
point for commercial development.
   Cambridge Seven, primarily an architectural design
concern, helped design Boston's New England Aquarium in 1962
as part of the city's efforts to revitalize a waterfront. The
Aquarium's role in attracting visitors prompted Baltimore in
1975 to hire the firm for its downtown revival.
   "We needed to design a structure that not only would be an
attraction in itself but would make the whole downtown
attractive," Mr. Chermayeff says. That meant making the
aquarium an integral part of a large complex, including a
museum, a promenade, a marina and a variety of retail stores
and restaurants. To integrate the smorgasbord of projects
into a coherent whole, "We ended up as urban designers," the
54-year-old architect says.
   The Baltimore aquarium was successful -- it attracts more
than 1.3 million visitors each year -- because the designers
were able to create a space that allowed its visitors to do
more than just look at fish, Mr. Chermayeff explains. "You
are creating an environment where people can spend the better
part of the day."
   The Cambridge Seven designers have recognized that
aquariums can't be designed in isolation -- they have to
reflect broader themes. In Chattanooga, Tenn., for example,
Mr. Chermayeff and his associates are designing a $40 million
aquarium that celebrates the Tennessee River from its origins
in the Smoky Mountains to its outlet in the Gulf of Mexico.
The freshwater exhibit, which features bass and red-bellied
turtles, gives way to a saltwater tank with tropical fish,
rays and sharks.
   But to build the aquarium as the anchor of Chattanooga's
riverfront development, waterfront streets and property lines
had to be adjusted: A highway was closed, downtown traffic
diverted.
   With the aquarium as the hub, the designers then created
plans for a river center that would be home to the National
Sport Fishing Center, along with a complex of retail stores
and offices and a hotel and conference center. "We had to
create not just a landmark aquarium as a first phase of
riverfront development but a larger mixed-use development,
with greater critical mass and drawing power," Mr. Chermayeff
explains.
   He hopes the retail anchor will be a store catering to
bass fishermen. "There are more than five million of them,"
he says. While about 50% of the businesses will convey the
sporting theme, the rest will attract general shoppers. "You
want a setting that allows you to be unique but not
inaccessible," he notes.
   In Osaka, Cambridge Seven at first was simply asked to
design an aquarium to anchor the city's new waterside
redevelopment. But the firm's economic studies showed the
aquarium would be better located where the marketplace was
planned. The Osaka developers agreed and asked Mr. Chermayeff
to design all the project.
   Like most such tasks, the Osaka project had tricky
specialized requirements. While the aquarium had to have a
theme strong enough to attract visitors, "we had to give
large numbers of people a memorable experience in as short a
period as an hour and a half," Mr. Chermayeff says. He and
Baltimore developer James Rouse created a marketplace with
distinctive architectural lines and artwork. Large marine
sculptures of metal and acrylic are suspended from the
ceiling, reinforcing the aquatic theme. "We needed to impose
a design structure that would unify the stores regardless of
what they sold," Mr. Chermayeff says.
   Mr. Chermayeff is also developing similar projects in
Toronto and Genoa, Italy. In Genoa, the firm will take a
further entrepreneurial step: For more than a year, it will
manage the aquarium and the commercial center surrounding it
-- and collect a share of the revenue.
