   MIAMI -- Two electronics companies, Maxell Corp. of
America and TDK Electronics Corp., were charged with
antitrust violations in a suit brought by a local wholesaler.
   Closely held Micro Computer Supply Inc., which sells
computer diskettes and other computer supplies and
accessories, alleged that Maxell and TDK engaged in
discriminatory pricing practices, including the granting of
discounts to wholesalers of the firms' consumer products.
