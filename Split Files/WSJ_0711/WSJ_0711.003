   Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., Raleigh, N.C., said it will
take a charge of about $81.6 million, or 97 cents a share,
against second-quarter earnings, citing a decision in a rate
case, but declined to estimate the net effect on its results.
   The utility had year-earlier net income of $72.6 million,
or 81 cents a share, on operating revenue of $558 million.

   Carolina Power said it agreed to a North Carolina
Utilities Commission decision on its $3.9 billion Harris
nuclear plant near Raleigh. The commission ruled that $389.4
million of that cost, while "prudently incurred," couldn't be
included in the company's rate base, because three of four
planned generating units at the plant had been canceled.
   The company said the order will keep its revenue at
current levels, with no immediate decrease in consumer rates,
but in the long run, rates will decline because of the
removal of the $389.4 million from the rate base. It said
this sum will be treated as canceled operations and amortized
over about six years without any return.
