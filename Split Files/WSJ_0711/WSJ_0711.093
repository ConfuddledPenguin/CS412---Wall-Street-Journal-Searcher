   NEW YORK -- The stock market fell victim to a late burst
of futures-related selling and finished lower amid a modest
pickup in trading.
   One of the session's most active issues, Pitney Bowes,
became the latest in a series of stocks battered by
earnings-related selling as its second-quarter profit
estimate failed to meet the market's expectations.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 23.27 to 2890.84
despite a solid performance from International Paper, whose
second-quarter earnings report was well received, and broader
market measures posted comparable declines.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 3.03 to 356.49, the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went down 1.47 to
194.76 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 2.33 to
331.94. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks
topped advancers by 969 to 529.
   Prices drifted through most of the session, generally at
lower levels, and then sank in the final hour of trading as
sell programs tied to stock-index arbitrage swept through the
market. The computer-assisted programs involved selling
baskets of stocks and purchasing index-futures contracts to
lock in profits from short-lived differences in price between
the two.
   Big Board volume improved to 147,630,000 shares -- the
highest total since June 22 -- from 119,390,000 Monday.
However, analysts said they don't expect much more
improvement in the volume of trading until the pace of
quarterly earnings releases begins to quicken.
   "It seems like nobody has any real incentive to do much of
anything," said Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "People are just awaiting all the
earnings reports for the second quarter."
   Pitney Bowes, which said it expects to report slightly
lower earnings for the quarter than it did a year ago,
plunged 6 3/8 to 43 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.6
million shares. Net income for the year-earlier quarter
amounted to 78 cents a share; analysts' forecasts for the
latest period were in a range of 85 cents to 88 cents,
according to Zacks Investment Research.
   Over the past few weeks, issues such as American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph and Caterpillar have come in for similar bouts of
heavy selling following forecasts that failed to live up to
the market's expectations.
   Others are likely to follow suit as the second-quarter
reports begin pouring into the market in the next couple of
weeks, Ms. Cohen said. "As some companies disappoint with
regard to earnings, they'll be taken out and shot."
   Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., added that many market players "want to wait and see the
{earnings} numbers" before moving off the sidelines. In the
meantime, Mr. Laux says, "The market is still going to do a
lot of drifting here."
   International Paper gained 7/8 to 52 1/2 after reporting
second-quarter earnings of $1.70 a share. Although the latest
results fell short of its year-ago performance -- the company
posted net income of $2.04 a share in the 1989 second quarter
-- they were better than analysts had generally expected.
   Du Pont added 1/4 to 37 3/8. Chemical industry analysts
are praising the company's management changes, and some
believe the stock is undervalued by comparison to issues of
other large industrial firms, this newspaper reported in its
"Heard on the Street" column.
   Other blue-chip issues that bucked the market's decline
included Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which gained 3/8
to 88 3/4, and Woolworth, which firmed 1/2 to 35 1/8. But
several of the market's recent high-fliers headed lower;
Philip Morris eased 7/8 to 48 1/8, Procter &amp; Gamble dropped
7/8 to 88 3/8, General Motors lost 3/4 to 48 1/8 and Boeing
slid 3/8 to 60.
   Handleman fell 3/8 to 13 1/4 on continued speculation that
its relationship with WalMart Stores, its second largest
customer, could be in jeopardy because Wal-Mart has agreed to
acquire Western Merchandisers, another distributor of
prerecorded music.
   Shares of Handleman fell two points Monday following news
of the accord; the stock dropped further even though the
company said the planned acquisition won't have a current
impact on the relationship. Wal-Mart, the Big Board's most
active issue, rose 5/8 to 33 3/8 on 4,565,600 shares;
retailing analysts are expecting a strong June sales report
from the company tomorrow.
   Albany International Class A tumbled 1 1/2 to 14 3/8 as
nearly 1.2 million shares, or more than 32 times the stock's
average daily volume, were traded. Chairman J. Spencer
Standish, who has voting control of the company through his
ownership of Class B common shares, disclosed that he isn't
planning to convert any of the stock into Class A common; the
conversion privilege takes effect Sept. 1.
   Ferro went up 1 to 26 1/2 amid talk that investors Jon M.
Huntsman and Phillip Frost, who both have clearance to
purchase as much as 15% of the company's common shares, were
buying the stock. Messrs. Huntsman and Frost declined to
comment.
   Abbott Laboratories, which delivered a second-quarter
earnings report in line with expectations, gained 3/4 to 42
3/4. Its net income rose 13% from a year earlier.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises added 1/8 to 23 3/8. In
reaffirming its buy recommendation on the stock, Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons increased its earnings estimate for the fiscal quarter
ending this month by three cents a share, to 20 cents, and
for the fiscal year ending next January by five cents a
share, to $1.55.
   Marshall Industries advanced 1/2 to 28 7/8 after
estimating that its earnings per share for the quarter ended
May 31 were in a range of 70 cents to 72 cents, up from 50
cents a year earlier.
   USF&amp;G fell 7/8 to 25 3/8 and traded as low as 24 3/4, a
52-week low, reflecting fears that the company's record of
dividend increases could be put in jeopardy because of
earnings weakness. Gloria Vogel, an analyst at Bear Stearns,
said the state of the payout is "a question mark"; she
lowered her estimates of the company's second-quarter and
full-year earnings last Friday.
   UDC-Universal Development lost 1 3/4 to 14 1/2. The
partnership said it expects net income and earnings per share
for the second quarter to be down "significantly" from the
year-earlier levels.
   WMS Industries fell 1 1/2 to 8 1/4 after National
Amusements denied that either itself or its chairman, Sumner
N. Redstone, was interested in a takeover. Mr. Redstone and
National Amusements hold a stake of about 28% in the company.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.92
to 357.73. Volume totaled 13,050,000 shares.
   Scandinavia Co. rose 5/8 to 8 3/8 after deciding to join
an investor group making a takeover offer for Bricom Group, a
British commercial services concern.
