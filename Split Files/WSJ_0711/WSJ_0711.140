   UDC-Universal Development L.P., citing partly a weaker
housing market in California, said it expects to report
second-quarter net income "significantly" lower than the
year-earlier $12 million, or $1.11 a share.
   The Tempe, Ariz., builder of family and adult residential
communities said new-home closings in the latest quarter fell
3% to $87 million from the record $89 million a year earlier.
UDC-Universal also attributed the decline in net to lower
margins, fewer home closings in California, and the company's
partial recapitalization last year. The company said it will
report second-quarter earnings in early August.

   The company noted that demand for housing in Arizona has
improved from a year earlier, and said it expects increases
in California sales as new subdivisions open in the second
half. UDC-Universal builds in Arizona, California, Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
