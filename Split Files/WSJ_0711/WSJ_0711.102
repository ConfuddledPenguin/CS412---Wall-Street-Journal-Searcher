   DALLAS -- Rosewood Financial Corp., in a radical new tack
to salvage its investment in troubled First Executive Corp.,
has called a truce with long-time nemesis Fred Carr, chairman
of the struggling Los Angeles-based insurer.
   Under the agreement, Rosewood will get to examine First
Executive's books in return for promising not to challenge
current management at the company's shareholders' meeting on
July 30.

   Earlier this year, Rosewood demanded Mr. Carr's ouster as
part of a highly conditional and ultimately failed $800
million takeover bid for First Executive. The insurer's huge
junk-bond portfolio led to a $775.6 million net loss in 1989.
   As a result of those losses Rosewood, a unit of Rosewood
Corp., which is owned by the trust estate of Texas oil
heiress Carolyn Rose Hunt, has seen a $100 million investment
in First Executive reduced in value to about $25 million.
   But despite such losses, Rosewood apparently is
considering an additional investment to prop up First
Executive and the Texans' truce with Mr. Carr is part of that
effort.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday,
Rosewood Financial Partners, which is controlled by Rosewood
Financial, said it's considering "the feasibility of
proposing a recapitalization, reorganization or
restructuring" of First Executive.
   As part of that effort, Rosewood reported that it had
entered into an agreement whereby First Executive will give
Rosewood access to the company's confidential financial
information and would consider -- but not guarantee --
increasing "non-affiliate representation" on its board.
   In return, Rosewood which holds a 9.9% stake in First
Executive, agreed not to solicit proxies at First Executive's
July 30 shareholders' meeting and not to vote for or nominate
any board candidate other than Albert G. Handschmacher, a
board member since 1969, who has been nominated for another
three-year term.
   In Los Angeles, Mr. Carr said that First Executive agreed
to provide Rosewood with the confidential information "to be
responsive and responsible" because Rosewood "says it has the
possibility of a proposal." Mr. Carr said he hasn't seen any
such proposal and that First Executive isn't currently
considering any Rosewood board nominees.
   A Rosewood spokesman declined to comment on the accord
beyond information contained in the SEC filing.
   In May, Rosewood proposed that First Executive appoint
Donald F. Craib Jr., former chairman and chief executive
officer of Allstate Insurance Group and Rosewood's candidate
to succeed Mr. Carr, to the board. That proposal was rejected
by First Executive's board and Rosewood has abandoned plans
to nominate Mr. Craib at the shareholders' meeting, according
to a person familiar with Rosewood's position.
   That same individual described the new agreement as an
"opportunity for both parties to put the past aside, focus on
the strengths of the company and focus on what can be done to
enhance the value for all parties."
   Other First Executive investors speculated that the pact
was a result of both Rosewood's inability to finance its own
hostile takeover in a market grown skittish of such attempts
and of Mr. Carr's concerns about other rumored takeover
attempts that would lead to his ouster. "It appears that Fred
Carr has taken the shark with the least teeth," said investor
Travis Reed, who said he owns a 2% stake in First Executive.
   In addition to its First Executive losses, Rosewood
recently lost control of its Dallas-based thrift, Southwest
Savings Association, which was placed under U.S.
conservatorship in May.
   One institutional investor who asked not to be named said
the truce between Rosewood and Mr. Carr could lead ultimately
to an alliance between Rosewood and First Boston Corp. The
investment-banking concern was retained by First Executive
earlier this year to advise the insurer on a financial
restructuring that could include the sale of one or more
operating units. "They can probably come up with a better
deal together rather than fighting each other," the investor
said.
   Mr. Carr declined to discuss First Boston's activities on
First Executive's behalf.
   Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, First
Executive stock closed at $3.0625, off 18.75 cents.
