   WASHINGTON -- A group of Republican senators summoned
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to Capitol Hill
to hear their concerns about a credit crunch and a stagnating
economy.
   Mr. Greenspan met in a closed session over lunch with
members of the Senate Republican Conference. Several of the
senators used the opportunity to complain about tightening
credit standards and urge the Fed to ease credit.

   "The senators were on his back about interest rates,
obviously," said Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) after the
meeting. According to Sen. Christopher Bond (R., Mo.), "There
were a lot of concerns expressed about the credit crunch."
   In his responses, the Fed chairman gave the senators
little reason to expect the central bank to cut interest
rates soon. Instead, he argued that the Fed is walking a very
narrow road right now, with the risk of recession close on
one side, but the risk of accelerating inflation close on the
other.
   The unusual Senate meeting was yet another sign that the
political pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates is
growing increasingly intense. The meeting comes just a few
days after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made a rare
public plea for lower interest rates. So far, however, the
Fed chairman shows no sign of budging.
   Mr. Greenspan spent part of the session discussing the
unusual employment figures released last week, according to
several people who attended. He said unemployment remains
very low, and labor-force growth is very sluggish. In
particular, he said, women and young people seem to be
entering the labor force at a surprisingly slow rate. As a
result, there aren't enough new workers to allow the economy
to grow at a much faster rate.
   In addition, the Fed chairman argued that if he eased
credit now, that might boost the economy for the next six
months or so but would ultimately result in more inflation
and force the Fed to crack down even harder in the future.
   Mr. Greenspan declined to say what decisions the Fed's
policy-making committee had made at its meeting last week.
But his comments appeared to reinforce previous reports from
government officials that the Fed has no immediate plans to
ease credit.
   But by acknowledging repeatedly that the Fed is operating
"at the edge" and walking a very narrow line, Mr. Greenspan
also indicated that any sharp change in the economic data
could lead the central bank to change its course.
   Chairman Greenspan also used the opportunity to make a
plea for cutting the budget deficit this year, according to
those who attended. The Fed chairman said that with slow
growth in the labor force, the only way to get the economy
moving is to increase the output, or "productivity," of the
existing labor force. And the best way to improve
productivity, he argued, is to increase investment by
boosting national savings and cutting the budget deficit.
   "He was very strong on that," said Sen. Bond. "He said the
best way to increase savings is to run" a budget surplus.
   The one clear voice of support for the Fed chairman came
from Florida GOP Sen. Connie Mack. According to several
people attending the lunch, Sen. Mack, a former banker,
questioned whether there was really a dangerous credit crunch
under way. He said that when bankers tell borrowers the
regulators won't let them make a loan, what they really mean
is the loan is too risky.
