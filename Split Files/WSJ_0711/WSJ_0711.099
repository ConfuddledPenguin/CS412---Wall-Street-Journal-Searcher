   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
a nearly $30.8 billion transportation bill that would raise
federal funding for aviation and highway programs by $2.3
billion in fiscal 1991 while rejecting Bush administration
cuts from rail and mass transit.
   The spending ceiling for the highway trust fund would grow
to a record $14.57 billion, and an estimated $8.17 billion is
provided for the Federal Aviation Administration, including
$717 million in increased funding for FAA facilities and
equipment and grants-in-aid to airports.

   The $1.8 billion total in airport grants is itself a 26%
increase from the current ceiling, and in the aviation and
highway accounts, the underlying measure reflects pressure to
tap into existing trust funds to finance new public works
improvements.
   "Take a good look at this bill, you may never see another
one like it," joked Rep. Lawrence Coughlin (R., Pa.), whose
state delegation helped lead the way in salting away tens of
millions of dollars for road projects not requested by the
administration.
   Coast Guard operating funds, assuming a $160 million
transfer from the Pentagon, would grow at a more modest 6.4%
rate. After years of often favorable treatment, the service
found itself challenged in terms of its effectiveness in the
anti-drug war and the nuts and bolts of ship procurement.
   The legislative report accompanying yesterday's bill cites
recurring problems in cost estimates for separate barge and
cutter programs. And while increasing drug-interdiction
funding to $602.6 million, the committee calls for
effectively ending the use of the speedy, high-profile boats
so identified with the drug war in recent years. Since early
1987, five of the 43-foot vessels, which can travel at a
speed of about 40 miles per hour, have been delivered to the
government at an estimated cost of $325,000 each, a Coast
Guard official said. Yet the committee report directs that
all of a $1.5 million request to operate and maintain the
boats after Sept. 30 be allocated elsewhere.
   Among major rail accounts, an estimated $632 million is
provided for Amtrak, and elsewhere, $12 million is set aside
to finance an increased government role in supporting the
development of magnetic levitation technology for high-speed
trains. Aid for conventional mass transit would grow only
modestly to $3.2 billion, but the bill attempts to reverse
the trend of recent years and would block the
administration's proposed cuts from formula grants to cities,
such as New York, with populations of more than one million.
   Although deficit-reduction talks with the White House are
certain to lead to cuts in the future, the transportation
bill fits a strategy by the Democratic leadership to use the
appropriations process to stake out the party's priorities
going into the fall elections. Back-to-back measures covering
the Treasury and Postal Service as well as the departments of
Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services are to come
before the panel this week, and bills covering agriculture,
natural resources, and military construction accounts are
moving through subcommittees.
   Amid this largesse, influential members have used their
position to help parochial interests. In an unusual display
yesterday, members of the transportation subcommittee
continued to add provisions to the very bill they had been
free to write in a closed-door session weeks ago.
   For example, even as the subcommittee report chastised the
Coast Guard for its procurement practices, Michigan and Texas
lawmakers jockeyed to assist competing contractors, General
Motors Corp.'s Allison Gas Turbine Division and Turbomeca
Engine Corp., a Texas unit of Labinal Corp. of France, which
have an interest in building replacement engines for the
service's troubled HH-65 Dolphin helicopter.
   Elsewhere, more than $243 million was added to the
administration's budget to fund scores of home-state road and
bridge projects, and Pennsylvania benefits here from its
power not only in the transportation subcommittee but also
over defense appropriations. The anticipated $160 million
transfer for the Coast Guard will be decided by the Pentagon
subcommittee, and in what amounts to an annual trade,
subcommittee Chairman John Murtha (D., Pa.) again secured
funding for highways, including $20 million toward the costs
of a project in his district.
   Among Washington lobbying firms, Cassidy &amp; Associates
Inc., remains a major force in securing federal funds, most
conspicuously through the Treasury and Postal Service
subcommittee. An estimated $20.7 billion bill, scheduled to
come before the full committee today, adds $43.5 million to
the administration request for the so-called federal
buildings fund, for example. Those benefiting include at
least five Cassidy hospital and university clients slated to
receive about $13 million for various construction projects.
   Republicans also share in the funds, which include $5
million earmarked by Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte for
Brandeis University and $5 million for the Primate Research
Institute in New Mexico backed by Rep. Joe Skeen, the
Treasury subcommittee's ranking GOP member.
