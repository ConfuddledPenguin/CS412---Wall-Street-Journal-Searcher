   Tokyo stocks tumbled in shallow activity, subdued by
rumor-driven, interest-rate concerns and system trading,
traders said.
   London shares, meanwhile, slipped at the close of moderate
trading after Wall Street failed to drag the key indexes from
the negative territory in which they languished throughout
the day.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 385.85 points to
32152.43.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose
140.96 points to 32293.39.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 350
million shares, down from 401.7 million shares Monday.
Decliners markedly outnumbered advancers 727 to 220, while
171 issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 24.64 points, or 1.04%, to 2337.77.
   The second section index dropped 10.05 points, or 0.24%,
to 4387.67.
   Investors noted that general profit-taking had been due
for the second section, which had risen a total of 286.14
points, or 6.99%, since June 25.
   Yesterday's volume in the section was estimated at 40.1
million shares, down from 45.8 million shares Monday.
   Early morning rumors in Sydney's foreign-exchange market
that the Bank of Japan may raise its official discount rate
soon had little impact on the Tokyo markets during the
morning, traders said.
   But in the afternoon, Tokyo stock and bond markets
weakened on news that U.S. investment advisory firm Smick
Medley International predicted Sunday that the Japanese
central bank is highly likely to raise its discount rate over
the next several months.
   The firm argued that the issue isn't on the principle of
raising rates but rather on the timing. "There is now an 80%
to 90% chance the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates
over the next several months,"the firm said in a report.
   "Obviously, the report is having a big impact on the
(stock) market," said Greg Byndy, manager of equity trading
at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. Particularly because of the stock
market's thin volume, the report effectively squeezed prices
as participants tried to discount the news, Mr. Byndy said.
   The dollar, which had already been weaker against the yen,
fell further after talk on the report hit the markets,
although observers emphasized that bearishness on the dollar
stems more from uncertainty about the outcome of this week's
Houston economic summit of seven leading industrialized
nations.
   But the bond market came off amid the Smick Medley news,
with the yield on the benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8% coupon of
1999, rising to 7.255%, up 5.5 basis points, or hundredths of
a percentage point, at the Tokyo Stock Exchange close.
   As the stock market continues its sluggishness while
digesting currency and interest-rate speculation, program
trading and selective institutional participation outside of
the first section has been predominant, traders noted.
   In the morning, spotty, index-linked selling was canceled
out by light program buying, while a mixed amount of both
later in the day had a somewhat neutral impact on the Nikkei
Index, observers said.
   Futures were trading at a reasonably large spread to the
cash index for most of the day, traders noted.
   Institutions have generally stayed clear of the stimulated
fluctuations on the broad market, moving instead to the
second section, over-the-counter, and other major city
indexes.
   While these markets have vigorously recovered from
post-crash lows of early April, traders stressed that they're
susceptible to tremendous volatility.
   Holding up well yesterday were pharmaceuticals, a typical
safe play when the yen's direction is uncertain, and some
retail and manufacturing shares.
   Chugai Pharmaceutical gained 50 yen to 1680 yen (33 cents
to $11.11), Banyu rose 40 yen to 1310 yen, and Yoshitomi rose
30 yen to 1830 yen.
   Ito-Yokado rose 10 yen to 4070 yen, and Noritake rose 60
yen to 1680 yen.
   Uni Charm rose 20 yen to 2300 yen, Wacoal rose 10 yen to
1440 yen, Kao Corp. added 20 yen to 1590 yen, and Lion rose 2
yen to 983 yen.
   Although Kyocera and Sony were hit by profit-taking, other
high-technology shares managed to sustain small gains.
   TDK rose 10 yen to 7370 yen, Pioneer Electronic added 10
yen to 6380 yen, and Aiwa added 30 yen to 2430 yen.
   Kyocera fell 140 yen to 8760 yen, while Sony fell 110 yen
to 8700 yen.
   Big losers included securities firms and banks, steel and
shipbuilding shares.
   In London, one trader blamed the market's drop on Wall
Street's lower opening. "We were looking for a rise in Wall
Street but it didn't happen," the trader said.
   The day's main feature was sterling's continued strength,
with the pound quoted as high as $1.8270 early in the
session.
   This strength caused a number of U.K. stocks with heavy
overseas earnings to be downgraded by analysts, dragging the
entire market lower. Among those to be singled out were
Glaxo, ICI, Reuters and Racal.
   Volume was moderate with 440.7 million shares changing
hands, compared with 387.3 million issues Monday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell 10
points to 2327.5. The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped
4.3 points to 1855.
   Shares to buck the trend and end higher included Cable &amp;
Wireless, up 6 pence at 530 pence (11 cents to $9.58), on
heavy U.S. buying. Hawker Siddeley gained 10 pence to 615
pence.
   Shares to ease included ICI, down 8 pence at #11.40; Reed
International, down 13 pence to 446 pence, General Accident,
down 9 pence to 527 pence, and Allied Lyons, down 8 pence to
488 pence.
   Trafalgar shed 15 pence to 288 pence, while
Trusthouse-Forte fell 10 pence to 290 pence on concern that
its London-based hotels will lose foreign tourist business
because of the strong pound.
   Other companies downgraded on sterling worries also saw
their stocks fall. Glaxo was down 1 pence at 829 pence,
Reuters eased 2 pence to #12.59, while Racal shed 1 pence to
204 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Stockholm and Madrid
but fell in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and
Milan. South African gold stocks also closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended higher in Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei,
Wellington and Manila and lower in Singapore and Sydney.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
