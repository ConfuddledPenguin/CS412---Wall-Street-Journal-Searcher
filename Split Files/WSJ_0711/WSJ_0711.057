   ST. LOUIS -- Directors of Interco Inc. were delighted to
hire Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella as anti-takeover
strategists in 1988. The investment bankers were famed Wall
Street warriors, and their "reputation was such that you got
them if you could," recalls Lee Liberman, an Interco
director.
   What Interco wound up getting from Wasserstein Perella &amp;
Co., however, was a series of financial maneuvers and a
recapitalization that did fend off a raider, but left it
staggering under $1.8 billion of debt.

   These days, Interco is hardly alone, with many companies
struggling with the debt legacy of the leverage-happy '80s.
But the story of how a conservatively run furniture and shoe
company such as Interco got into trouble helps explain why so
many companies are stuck in similar binds.
   In retrospect, Interco desperately needed someone in late
1988 to rein in the optimism of its top executives and
fee-hungry investment bankers. No one did, despite ample
warning signs. Interco turned into a case study of how badly
Wall Street advice can misfire.
   Now Interco has defaulted on bond payments due June 15.
Its stock has sunk to fractional prices that sound like
drill-bit sizes: 5/16ths, 9/32nds. The company is talking
about filing for bankruptcy protection against creditors. Its
chief executive has quit, and Wasserstein Perella has been
dropped. Cash is so scarce that Interco's new chairman broke
his predecessor's office in half with gray drywall partitions
so he could cram executives into smaller quarters and save on
rent.
   The story is laid out in court documents, including
Interco board minutes, financial forecasts from Interco and
Wasserstein Perella and the investment firm's presentations
to Interco directors, plus numerous interviews. The
documents, filed in Court of Chancery in Delaware, show that
the company's fate was decided, to a remarkable degree, by a
few number-crunching financial people operating with little
oversight by top officials at either Interco or Wasserstein
Perella. They created "Project Imperial," a fantasy-land
version of what Interco assets could bring at auction, how
much its Lane and Broyhill furniture units and its Converse
sneaker and Florsheim shoe operations could earn, and how
much debt Interco could tolerate.
   Interco "secured a lot of very, very bad advice from its
Wall Street advisers," concludes 81-year-old Nathan Ancell,
an Interco director at the time. "They put a lot of wild
figures together." Another former director, Charles J.
Rothschild Jr., agrees: "We were given rather poor advice."
   Wasserstein Perella, through a spokesman, says its advice
was based on Interco management's own budget data and seemed
appropriate at the time. Yet Wasserstein Perella's financial
analysts -- including one just a year and a half out of
college -- spun out 10-year projections of cash flow and
earnings and recommended a new capital structure, all without
doing much basic research.
   This spring, Interco agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle
a shareholders' lawsuit charging that directors had breached
their fiduciary duty by approving the recapitalization
instead of letting an outside suitor buy the company.
Wasserstein Perella was a co-defendant in that suit, filed in
the Delaware court, but was indemnified by Interco. One
shareholder attorney, Robert Harwood, says he would have
liked to press for larger damages but saw little hope of
collecting. "This company has been squeezed dry like a
raisin," he says.
   Interco's troubles started in the spring of 1988, when
Harvey Saligman, then its chief executive, feared that it
might become a takeover target. Mr. Saligman turned to Mr.
Wasserstein, whom he had liked when they worked together on
Interco's acquisition of Converse in 1986.
   "Bruce Wasserstein was brilliant," says Gene Smith,
Interco's chief financial officer. But Interco executives
seldom saw him except at board meetings. Detailed work on
Interco was left largely to Scott Mohr, the 34-year-old head
of Wasserstein Perella's Chicago office, and to younger
people who worked for him.
   Soon after being hired, Wasserstein Perella began
counseling Interco on ways to ward off a takeover bid that
had arrived -- via fax -- from Steven and Mitchell Rales of
Washington, D.C. The Raleses, both then in their 30s, didn't
know much about Interco's businesses. They once dismayed an
analyst group by talking about the appeal of furniture
"galleria" stores; the industry term is "gallery." But
investors took them seriously because their bid was backed by
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., then the junk-bond powerhouse.
   Within two weeks of the Raleses' initial bid of $64 a
share, Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein decided that the offer
was inadequate, that Interco was worth $68 to $80 a share, or
more. Just as they were en route to deliver that appraisal to
Interco's directors, the Rales brothers raised the ante to
$70 a share -- a figure Wasserstein Perella also deemed
inadequate. Two weeks later, Messrs. Wasserstein and Mohr
told Interco directors the company was worth $74 to $87 a
share or more. The two investment bankers suggested that
Interco fight the Raleses with a recapitalization package
that would spew out $1.5 billion or more of cash and junk
bonds to shareholders.
   Such recaps -- a short-lived fad on Wall Street -- enabled
managements to beat junk-bond-financed raiders at their own
game, by loading up a company with debt but keeping a
low-priced "stub" of its stock publicly traded. Wasserstein
Perella valued the package of cash and securities, including
the stub, at $76 a share. Interco's board approved the plan
in September 1988.
   Although piling up a lot of debt can wreck a company,
Interco's managers and investment bankers weren't deterred,
even when two corporate-debt experts concluded that the
company couldn't handle the massive borrowing required to
beat the Rales offer, which eventually rose to $74 a share.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which sent a 17-person
reconnoitering team to Interco's St. Louis headquarters, and
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. each considered a leveraged buy-out of
Interco but decided against it, the court papers show.
   "I don't think this company is worth anything that starts
with a 7," a KKR partner, Paul Raether, says he told Mr.
Wasserstein. When Mr. Wasserstein insisted that Interco was
worth more than $70 a share, Mr. Raether says he replied:
"Bruce, don't whip us around. Our valuation of the company is
different."
   However, such skepticism never crept inside the 19-story
Interco Tower in St. Louis. Interco's controller, Stanley
Huck, began working until midnight compiling forecasts of how
much each division could earn. Division managers offered
their own estimates, but Mr. Huck decided that some were too
pessimistic. He later said, in a deposition in the
shareholders' suit, that he bounced some projections back to
division managers and asked for higher ones.
   Mr. Huck didn't return repeated phone calls seeking
comment. An Interco spokesman says Mr. Huck "is as straight a
guy as you'll ever meet. He didn't do anything wrong."
   At Wasserstein Perella's 41st-floor offices in downtown
Chicago, the investment bankers lofted Mr. Huck's optimistic
projections to new heights. Interco itself was most
comfortable forecasting only a year or two ahead and didn't
make any projections beyond four years. But Robert W. Medway,
a Wasserstein Perella analyst just 15 months out of college,
helped spin out 10-year projections on computer spreadsheets,
forecasting 9.2% profit growth as far away as fiscal 1998.
There wasn't a single declining year for any division. Mr.
Medway declines to comment.
   The biggest leap of faith by Interco and Wasserstein
Perella involved the company's Converse division. The
athletic-shoe business is noted for booms and busts, as most
retailers and midlevel Converse executives knew. "One year
we'd be going like crazy, and the next year everything would
slow down," recalls Jackie Granus, a former Converse
marketing official.
   But contrary to usual investment-banking practice,
Wasserstein Perella didn't visit any of Converse's plants or
its North Reading, Mass., headquarters or even contact its
big customers. "{Mr.} Wasserstein and others relied on the
company's commitment that it could achieve its operating
targets," a Wasserstein Perella spokesman says.
   After a few talks in St. Louis with top Converse
executives, Mr. Mohr and his analysts punched nonstop-growth
estimates for the athletic-shoe maker into their computer.
Converse executives thought they could post a record $70
million of operating earnings in fiscal 1990, thanks to
then-popular items such as green canvas sneakers and Conasaur
shoes for children.
   The Wasserstein Perella men "sprinkled holy water" on the
forecast, says Steve Encarnacao, a former Converse senior
vice president. "No one put it under the kind of scrutiny
they should have."
   When Wasserstein Perella did send analysts to an Interco
division, financial ebullience still prevailed over the views
of experienced local managers. Wasserstein Perella initially
valued the Ethan Allen division at $587 million, then lowered
its estimate to about $500 million after realizing that the
furniture maker's profits were deteriorating.
   Even that sparked criticism. "The values they put on Ethan
Allen were preposterous," says Mr. Ancell, the former Interco
director and Ethan Allen chairman. "We told them they were
crazy. There were loads and loads of nice young kids {from
Wasserstein Perella} who didn't know much who were analyzing
figures" at Ethan Allen's Danbury, Conn., headquarters, Mr.
Ancell says.
   Ethan Allen was eventually sold for only $388 million. A
Wasserstein Perella spokesman blames "an unfortunate
double-whammy" -- Ethan Allen management kept lowering its
profit forecasts while the junk-bond market's collapse made
it hard for potential acquirers to find financing.
   When it came time to talk fees, Mr. Wasserstein got
personally involved -- and he got angry. He wanted $7.5
million for five months of work by perhaps two dozen people,
most of them working on Interco only part-time. That was too
much, Mr. Saligman, Interco's chief executive, countered.
Messrs. Wasserstein and Mohr got "quite upset," Mr. Saligman
later testified. Interco and Wasserstein Perella finally
settled on a $5.5 million fee.
   On Nov. 16, 1988, the Rales brothers dropped out of the
bidding, even though they had just won a Delaware court
ruling that aided their Interco offer. "They astutely decided
that the company wasn't worth it," a former Drexel adviser to
the brothers says. "Some of the operating businesses seemed
softer. And they thought the whole merger environment was
getting worse."
   Interco still had time to scuttle its high-debt
recapitalization plan, and by then alarm bells should have
been ringing. A business downturn at Ethan Allen and the Lane
furniture business was so evident that Wasserstein Perella
lowered its estimate of operating profit at the four core
businesses for the year ending Feb. 28, 1989, by $5 million,
or 3%, to $161 million. Converse's sneaker inventory was
piling up -- a worrisome sign that the green-sneaker boom
might have peaked. The sneaker company soon would report a
collapse in third-quarter earnings.
   But Wasserstein Perella stayed bullish about Interco's
fiscal 1990 outlook. It predicted a 61% surge in operating
profit at Interco's core businesses, thanks to $75 million of
cost reductions that supposedly wouldn't hurt sales.
   Some directors later testified that they weren't aware of
any financial reason Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein would want
the recap to be carried out. But a confidential fee letter
shows that once the Rales brothers dropped out, Wasserstein
Perella could collect the final two-thirds of its fee, the
last $3.7 million, only if the recap was completed.
Otherwise, Wasserstein Perella would get only $1.8 million.
   Mr. Wasserstein evidently wanted this contingent fee kept
secret. "For cosmetic reasons, Bruce Wasserstein was very
concerned about filing public documents with a fee of $5.5
million," Mr. Saligman testified. A Wasserstein Perella
spokesman says the investment bank's judgment wasn't swayed
by the fee's structure. Nevertheless, if Interco had
abandoned its recap in late November, "the fee that we would
have received would have been less than we would have felt
appropriate," Mr. Mohr later testified.
   At Interco's Nov. 22, 1988, board meeting, Messrs. Mohr
and Wasserstein dazzled directors with 26 pages of elaborate
analysis designed to make the recap seem feasible. They
projected a blizzard of statistics on a big screen in the
board room. The math was so intricate that Mr. Mohr later
referred to some of it as "optics" -- Wall Street slang for
financial wizardry. Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein outlined
possible gains that Interco shareholders might enjoy after
the recap; the worst case was a 20% annual return.
   Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein did hint that their
number-crunching might not be based on rock-solid
foundations. A single page of their Nov. 22 presentation said
that they had assumed that management earnings projections
were right and that Interco could sell $1.15 billion of
assets in 18 months to repay a temporary "bridge loan" from
banks.
   Nowhere did Wasserstein Perella acknowledge, however, that
Interco's most recent 12-month operating earnings, at $227
million, fell far short of the $350 million needed annually
to service its debt. A Wasserstein Perella spokesman says
that risks of the recap were "extensively discussed" at the
Nov. 22 directors' meeting. Yet board minutes show that only
two of directors' 24 questions pertained to what might happen
if Interco failed to meet its targets. Wasserstein Perella
didn't present any downside forecasts to illustrate the risks
of a slump in sales.
   Directors embraced the recap plan despite some misgivings.
"This is getting tight," Mr. Liberman testified that he told
a fellow director during a break in the Nov. 22 board
meeting. Nevertheless, Interco management affirmed that it
could meet its earnings targets. The board unanimously
approved Wasserstein Perella's plan -- allowing Messrs.
Wasserstein and Mohr to collect their full fee.
   Mr. Saligman, who declined to be interviewed for this
article, had predicted in September 1988 that the asset sales
would be a snap. He called the banks' 18-month time limit a
"luxury," adding: "We're going to start immediately. We're
looking at weeks, hopefully, to get this job done."
   Instead, Interco's finances quickly started to unravel.
The Ethan Allen division wasn't the only division sold for
far less than Wasserstein Perella predicted. The Central
Hardware division, appraised at $312 million, brought in just
$245 million. Although an eroding junk-bond market may have
held down bids, observers say Wasserstein Perella's sale
projections would have been difficult to achieve in anything
but the best of financial times.
   Converse, meanwhile, turned into a disaster. It had fiscal
1990 operating profit of $11 million, far below the predicted
$70 million. Its green canvas sneakers, which management had
thought would be a big seller at $35 a pair, ended up in such
overstock that they were dumped at flea markets for $6 a
pair.
   The cash and junk-bond package that Wasserstein Perella
devised never approached its stated values. The package was
supposed to be worth at least $76 a share. But the closest it
came was $72.50 in February 1989. After that, its value fell
steadily, reaching as low as $42 a share this spring. Mr.
Mohr's "optics" proved an illusion. Even some Interco
managers dumped the recap-related junk bonds.
   Interco's hard times brought a series of resignations and
dismissals. Mr. Saligman quit in May 1989 and was replaced as
chief executive by the former Converse chairman, Richard
Loynd. Later last year, Mr. Loynd dropped Wasserstein Perella
and hired J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. to advise Interco on how to
handle its debts. For the fiscal year ended Feb. 24, Interco
reported a $48.6 million loss -- instead of the $18 million
of net income that Wasserstein Perella had predicted.
   Now, Mr. Loynd is struggling to undo the damage from the
1988 recapitalization. "These are fine {operating}
companies," Mr. Loynd insists. "It's a crime if this goes
into bankruptcy."
   J.P. Morgan and Mr. Loynd have devised a plan to cancel
much of Interco's junk-bond debt and let the bondholders own
70% of the company instead. Interco is circulating new
projections, including a cautious "downside case," in hopes
of persuading creditors to trade in their bonds instead of
pushing the company into bankruptcy proceedings or
liquidation.
   But some creditors, who have seen the bond prices fall as
much as 90%, haven't forgiven a company that could stumble so
soon after taking on so much debt. "Why should we believe
you?" one testy bondholder asked Mr. Loynd at a meeting in
New York June 4. "Your last set of projections was so
inaccurate."
   "That's a reasonable question," Mr. Loynd gamely replied.
"But these projections are a lot lower. And we've spent a lot
more time on them."
