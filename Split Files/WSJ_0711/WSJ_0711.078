   NEW YORK -- The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
dropped the remaining criminal charges against Adnan
Khashoggi, who was acquitted with Imelda Marcos in a federal
racketeering trial last week.
   The motion to dismiss the two counts of conspiracy and
racketeering must be approved by U.S. Judge John Keenan, who
presided over the Marcos trial. In a court filing, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said the two charges were based
on the same allegations on which Mr. Khashoggi was acquitted.

   The Saudi businessman was extradited from Switzerland in
July 1989 to stand trial on charges of obstruction of justice
and mail fraud in the Marcos case. Under Mr. Khashoggi's
extradition arrangement, he couldn't be tried on the other
two charges, although they remained pending, because
Switzerland doesn't have a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law.
   Mrs. Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines who
has lived in Hawaii since 1986, was found innocent of all
charges by a Manhattan federal jury.
