   American Conservative Union head David Keene this week
invited Pete Dupont to meet with a select group of
conservatives. The topic: a populist response to George
Bush's abandonment of his no-new-taxes pledge. The
president's move, the former Delaware governor and Republican
presidential candidate says, requires the GOP to "consider
how to restore leadership to our cause."
   Conservatives are deep in frustration and ferment these
days. After a decade and a half of dominating American
politics, there's fear in the ranks that they are losing
their edge. Certainly, they've lost their central benefactor,
Ronald Reagan, and they've lost the central idea,
anti-communism, that propelled their success. Love of the
Gipper and hatred of the commies was the glue that held
together the disparate elements in the conservative
coalition: libertarians and Jesse Helms's
let's-put-government-cops-in-every-bedroom faction;
supply-side tax-cutters and balanced-budget, creditor-class
Republicans; internationalists and isolationists; Wall
Streeters and Main Streeters.

   Conservatives are debating whether to challenge Mr. Bush
or merely to consider his presidency an acceptable holding
action until the next Reagan surfaces. "Conservatism is still
the dominant idea in the land, but the movement isn't very
vibrant right now," acknowledges John Buckley, a conservative
political strategist and member of the first family of
American conservatism. "Since Reagan and the dissolution of
communism, there has been a concomitant Balkanization."
   Nowhere has that been more evident than in the fallout
over Mr. Bush's abandonment of his no-new-taxes pledge, which
some conservatives feel is the domestic equivalent of losing
the anti-communism issue. Now, economic conservatives are
left debating how to fashion initiatives on issues such as
education (with some success) and the environment (with not
much success) that go beyond "Just Say No."
   Schisms are equally apparent on social issues. While
conservative politicians seized on the movement for a
constitutional amendment against flag-burning, many
conservative intellectuals and columnists lambasted it as a
feeble effort to recapture the traditional-values issue.
   Likewise, right-wing "populist" attacks on obscene art
have split the libertarian and traditional-values
constituencies. Although it's doubtful this really is a major
issue, a conservative consensus may form around opposing most
federal funding for art but steering clear of censorship.
   Conservative angst is equally acute in the debate over
post-Cold War foreign policy. Isolationist strains are
resurfacing, as personified by Patrick Buchanan, a former top
Nixon and Reagan aide, now a television commentator and
columnist.
   Mr. Buchanan pushes the idea of a fortress America, ending
the U.S. presence in NATO and Asia and abolishing foreign
aid. "Our going-away gift to the globalist ideologues should
be to tell the Third World we are not sending the gunboats to
collect our debts, but nor are we sending more money," he
says. "The children are on their own."
   But that is unacceptable to the internationalists --
"missionaries," Irving Kristol calls them. Also unacceptable
to these conservatives is a growing strain of right-wing
populism on international economic issues. For instance,
California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speech
writer and one of the ascending younger conservative
politicians, is a neo-protectionist.
   There's no lack of conservatives trying to grapple with
these issues, from think tanks like the eccentric Rockford
Institute to the influential Heritage Foundation, and from
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich to lesser-known officials such
as Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson.
   So far, though, nothing resembling a consensus has
emerged, and meanwhile, conservatives are faced with an even
tougher task: Finding the new Reagan. The most natural
candidate is HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who probably generates
more ideas than any other politician in America. But he has
two drawbacks for conservative activists: As a member of the
Bush administration, he can't lead the movement for a new
agenda; and his upbeat, inclusive approach to politics is
inconsistent with the anger that has been a sustaining
element of the conservative movement.
   Within conservative circles, Mr. Buchanan and evangelical
minister Pat Robertson are probably the two most discussed
potential challengers to George Bush. While the White House
desperately wants to avoid any right-wing insurgency in 1992,
though, it views these two as not very threatening, and views
its conservative critics in general as paper tigers.
   Even Rep. Gingrich says some of the Bush critics are
rooted in the politics of yesteryear. "They define
conservatism by common situs picketing and the Panama Canal
treaties," the GOP whip says. "These aren't the issues of the
1990s."
   These aren't altogether bad times for conservatives. Many
of the more interesting current ideas -- vouchers for
education, home ownership for public-housing tenants --
suggest that the right still has more vitality than the left.
Moreover, while emotional issues like abortion test the
conservative coalition, it's well to remember that the
Democrats' New Deal coalition flourished for almost four
decades in the midst of the struggle over civil rights, an
even more wrenching issue. Irving Kristol notes that
conservative carping about Mr. Bush sounds like liberal
complaints about Harry Truman 40 years ago.
   Still, it's hard to think of George Bush as the Harry
Truman of this age. And while David Keene's meeting may be
provocative, it's even harder to think of Pierre S. du Pont
IV as the leader of a "populist" revolt, conservative or
otherwise.
