   MIAMI -- Burger King Corp. will add Domino's pizza to its
menu in a one-town test this fall.
   The No. 2-ranked hamburger chain said six-inch pizzas made
by Domino Pizza Inc.'s Pizzazz division will be sold in four
company-owned stores in the Columbia, S.C., market. The pizza
will be clearly identified as coming from Domino's.

   A Burger King spokeswoman denied that the test is simply a
reaction to McDonald's Corp.'s two-year effort to develop
pizza for its nationwide chain. "We see pizza as a strong,
growing segment of the fast-food market," she said.
   Indeed, Burger King has toyed with developing its own
pizza product for years. Its parent, Grand Metropolitan PLC,
is among the nation's largest makers of frozen, packaged
pizza through its Pillsbury Co. unit.
   The spokeswoman said the experiment with Ann Arbor,
Mich.-based Domino's doesn't preclude tests with other
brands.
