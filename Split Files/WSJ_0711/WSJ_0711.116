   SunTrust Banks Inc., Atlanta, reported a 3% increase in
second-quarter net income, to $88.5 million, or 69 cents a
share, reflecting an additional provision in its loan-loss
reserve.
   In 1989's second quarter, SunTrust had net of $85.9
million, or 66 cents a share.

   As reported, a special examination by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency prompted the banking company to
provide loan-loss reserves of $64.6 million for the quarter.
That figure is $24.8 million more than the 1989 second
quarter and $26.6 million more than the 1990 first quarter.
   SunTrust said the negative effect of the additional
provision on earnings was partially offset by two unrelated
purchase accounting adjustments on earlier acquisitions
totaling about $19 million.
   The company, which has $31.3 billion in assets, said
nonperforming assets totaled $503 million as of June 30,
compared with $296.3 million a year earlier. The most recent
figure includes $322.1 million in problem loans.
   For the first six months of the year, net rose 3.8% to
$176.4 million, or $1.38 a share, from $169.9 million, or
$1.31 a share, the year earlier.
