   Romantically, we wed in June,
   A gilt-edged bridal carriage,
   But strife became apparent soon --
   You see, 'twas a mixed marriage.
   It's difficult, I will not lie,
   Though my good wife's a gem,
   She loves her Macintosh, while my
   System's IBM.
   -- Bob Sack.

   Sunburn: getting more than what you basked for.
