   A federal judge in New York rejected objections by the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters to proposed rules for
the union's court-ordered elections next year.
   Judge David N. Edelstein, in a strongly worded opinion,
referred to the union's protests as "frivolous,"
"inappropriate," and "unpersuasive." Moreover, he said, "The
IBT's behavior over the past year indicates official
rejection of reform -- and with it, free elections."

   Judge Edelstein stressed the importance of the election
rules as "the linchpin" in the government's effort to purge
the nation's largest union of the alleged influence of
organized crime. "An election under these rules beacons the
coming of the light of freedom to this dark union," the judge
wrote.
   Teamsters officials and attorneys couldn't be reached for
comment on whether the union plans an appeal.
   The union is under court order to hold direct,
secret-ballot elections next year for top officers as part of
its settlement last spring of civil racketeering charges
brought by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. In the past, union
leaders were elected at a national convention by delegates
hand-picked at the local union level.
   In its 1988 suit, the government accused the Teamsters
leadership of depriving its 1.7 million members of their
rights through a pattern of racketeering. The government
claimed that organized crime figures had routinely influenced
union elections.
   As part of the 1989 accord, Judge Edelstein appointed
three officers to oversee the union as it moves toward the
goal of free elections. Election Officer Michael H. Holland,
a Chicago lawyer, drafted election rules that he submitted to
Teamsters locals early this year. Mr. Holland then visited
locals nationwide and in Canada to discuss the rules and hear
the concerns.
   Meanwhile, in Manhattan federal court, the Teamsters'
current leadership was voicing its own concerns. The union,
for example, challenged the requirement that each local
submit a plan to the elections officer outlining such details
as its method for counting ballots and the name of the
outside agency hired to conduct the election. The judge said,
"The election officer cannot supervise this election without
the specific information contained in a local union plan."
   The union also disputed a rule allowing candidates to
publish campaign literature in "International Teamster," the
internal union organ controlled by the current leadership and
distributed to all 1.7 million members each month.
   The union argued that the rule violated its right to free
speech by compelling it to publish specific material. The
judge said, among other things, "No opposition candidate may
mount a viable challenge to the entrenched IBT plutocracy
without standing on an equal footing with regard to
distribution of their views."
   The judge also ruled that the union's membership list may
be distributed to the accredited candidates -- a move that
both the union and the election officer had protested. There
was a danger, they argued, that the list could be copied and
used for improper purposes by employers, rival unions and
subversive groups. But the judge said that "extraordinary
measures are necessary to ensure that this election
succeeds." However, the judge prohibited the distribution of
the list to third parties.

   SODOMY LAWS in Michigan and Kentucky found to violate
state constitutions.
   In both states, lower court judges ruled that the laws
violate the right to privacy under the states' constitutions.
The decisions reflect the success of a strategy adopted by
gay activists four years ago to turn to state courts rather
than to federal courts in challenging such laws.
   The decisions, if upheld by the states' appeals courts,
also appear to open a door to the use of privacy arguments in
state constitutional challenges to restrictions on abortions.
   In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal
Constitution doesn't prohibit states from banning sodomy, and
it rejected the right-to-privacy arguments. The constitutions
of 10 states, however, explicitly grant a right to privacy.
In other states, such as Michigan and Kentucky, such a right
has emerged through years of state court decisions unrelated
to the sodomy laws.
   Florida, Arizona, Montana, Louisiana and South Carolina
are among the states that have laws banning sodomy and also
have specific right-to-privacy protection in their
constitutions. Evan Wolfson, an attorney with Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, a national gay-rights
organization based in New York, said Lambda is weighing
whether to pursue cases in such states.
   In the Michigan and Kentucky decisions, both judges said
that the right to privacy prohibited the state from banning
consensual sexual acts among adults in the privacy of their
homes.
   In the Michigan case, in which the plaintiffs included
heterosexuals and homosexuals because the law applies to all
people, Circuit Court Judge John A. Murphy of Wayne County
said, "The Michigan Constitution embodies a promise that a
certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept
largely beyond the reach of the government."
   A spokesman for Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley
said he will decide in a couple of weeks whether to appeal. A
spokesman for Kentucky Attorney General Fred Cowan said it's
not clear whether the decision last month will be appealed.
In both cases, the attorneys general argued that the laws
were constitutional.

   PATIENTS DENIED share in profits from research using their
blood or tissue.
   The California Supreme Court's ruling on Monday was a boon
to the biotechnology industry, which feared that litigation
by patients might have a chilling effect on the research and
development of valuable new products.
   The suit was filed by John Moore, who sought treatment for
a rare type of leukemia at the University of California at
Los Angeles Medical Center in 1976. David Goldie, a doctor
there, removed Mr. Moore's spleen as part of the treatment.
   While experimenting with cells from the diseased spleen,
Dr. Goldie and a colleague developed a cell line that
produces proteins found in the human immune system and is
considered valuable in research on cancer and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. The university patented the cell line in
1984.
   That same year, Mr. Moore sued the university, the
researchers and two biotech firms using the cell line,
claiming they had misappropriated his bodily material and
commercially exploited it without his knowledge or consent.
He alleged that as the owner of the bodily materials, he was
entitled to a share in the future profits derived from them.
   The high court found that Mr. Moore was not entitled to a
share of the profits from the patented cell line, whose
potential value had been estimated at $3 billion. The court
said that the patent was not for Mr. Moore's cells but for a
product of human invention.
   The court did allow Mr. Moore to go to trial on his claim
that Dr. Goldie failed to disclose his personal financial or
research interests before obtaining Mr. Moore's consent to
the medical treatment.
   "Physicians are expected to tell patients about
information relevant to their physical condition, such as the
side effects of a drug. But it wasn't customary to talk about
a doctor's financial or research interests. This adds
something new," said Daniel Callahan, director of the
Hastings Center, a Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., research
organization on ethics and medicine.
   Sanford M. Gage, Mr. Moore's lawyer, said his client still
may be able to recover significant damages if he proves that
Dr. Goldie violated a fiduciary duty by failing to inform Mr.
Moore of his personal interest in use of the spleen. Mr. Gage
said, "We can get a share of the profits, and possibly
punitive damages."
   Richard D. Godown, president of Industrial Biotechnology
Association, the main biotech trade group, characterized the
ruling as "a very big victory" for biotechnology that had
biotech companies "breathing a sigh of relief."
   He added that "we will simply have to reorganize the
consent forms and the procedures used with these forms to
make sure that not only medical issues are covered. It
behooves everybody involved to be more careful."

   INSURANCE REGULATION rejecting HIV test requirement gets a
hearing.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court,
agreed to review a lower court ruling that rejected the
regulation, which prohibited insurers from using the human
immunodeficiency virus blood test in underwriting individual
and small-group hospital and medical insurance.
   Court approval of the New York insurance department's
regulation would run counter to the trend of decisions in a
handful of other states. Recently, state regulators'
attention has focused on getting consent for such testing and
maintaining the confidentiality of test results, said an
official with the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners.
   In August l987, the New York insurance department adopted
an amendment to an existing regulation that prohibited
insurers from using the blood test for detection of the AIDS
virus in underwriting, rating or administering claims for
hospital and medical insurance. The ruling also prohibited
inquiries regarding the test on health insurance applications
or in interviews.
   New York regulators believe that the HIV test isn't a
diagnostic test for AIDS, and that the "denial of health
insurance is a most serious consequence of a testing
procedure that indicates only an exposure to a virus," said
Salvatore R. Curiale, New York's superintendent of insurance.
   The New York regulation has never been implemented because
it was challenged by a group of insurers and trade
associations. The state supreme court annulled the amendment
in April 1988. The appellate division of the supreme court
upheld that ruling in February.

   MCKENNA, CONNER &amp; CUNEO will split into two financially
separate branches.
   The 250-lawyer firm was formed in 1980 from a merger
between Washington-based Sellers, Conner &amp; Cuneo and Los
Angeles-based McKenna &amp; Fitting. Two years after the merger,
each branch reverted to independent management, though their
finances remained linked.
   The current financial divorce proceedings will further
separate the branches, which will coordinate some work with
each other but have little else but their name in common.
Partners at McKenna Conner say the two branches may
ultimately sever their ties completely.
   The law firm's trouble operating as one unit appears to
reflect differences between the two branches in the types of
clients they cater to and in their strategies for future
growth.
   Charles Yonkers, managing partner of the firm's Washington
office, said the East Coast branch, which has traditionally
focused on government contracts work, is now trying to
diversify its practice. By contrast, Mr. Yonkers said, the
West Coast branch has continued to focus on its traditional
clientele, financial institutions.
   Lawyers and consultants say the recent push toward
law-firm consolidation has prompted some firms to rush
blindly into unsuitable mergers. "Firms today are in such a
hurry to merge . . . that they miss critical steps," said
Howard Mudrick, who specializes in law-firm mergers at
Hildebrandt Inc., a Somerville, N.J., consulting firm.
