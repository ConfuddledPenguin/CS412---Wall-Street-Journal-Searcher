   TOKYO -- Reflecting a steady uptrend, orders for machinery
received by Japanese manufacturers in May climbed 13.4% from
a year earlier to 1.658 trillion yen ($250.7 million), the
Economic Planning Agency announced.
   Orders dipped 0.2% last December, interrupting the
increase that started in October 1988, but they have been
rising again each month since the beginning of 1990.

   The sustained increase is evidence of Japanese
corporations' desires to modernize, in anticipation of better
business in the future, officials said.
   The latest gain was also attributed to the fact that the
government, having failed to pass its fiscal 1989 budget
through parliament in time, held down orders in May 1989.
