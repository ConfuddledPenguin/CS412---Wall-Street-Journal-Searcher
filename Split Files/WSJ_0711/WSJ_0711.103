   Philip Morris Cos. plans substantial investments in
building up the confectionary and coffee businesses of Jacobs
Suchard AG, according to a vice president of the New York
company's Kraft foods subsidiary.
   "We will invest heavily (in Suchard) in the upcoming
years," said Luc E. Vandevelde in defending as "fair and
attractive" the takeover offer that officially was made
yesterday to shareholders of the Swiss company.

   He dismissed as an unfounded rumor that Philip Morris is
considering selling off the Suchard confectionary division.
"It would be totally against the spirit of the deal," the
Kraft executive insisted. "We will sell to nobody."
   The acquisition -- valued at nearly seven billion Swiss
francs (about $5 billion) -- was announced last month and is
part of Philip Morris's international expansion strategy.
