   American Airlines said it will impose surcharges on
passengers originating travel from five U.S. airports
beginning Sunday.
   The airline, a unit of AMR Corp., of Fort Worth, Texas,
said it was setting a special "passenger facilities charge"
because of what it says are higher costs associated with the
airports.

   The airports and the surcharges are: New Jersey's Newark,
$4; New Orleans International, $1.50; New York's La Guardia
and Florida's West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, $1.
   The surcharge will be imposed only on passengers
originating travel in those cities. Passengers making round
trips from these cities will be charged only once.
   American said it was passing along to passengers special
costs associated with landing at those airports. A spokesman
for American said: "Our corporate real estate people
identified charges we feel are excessive or unreasonable to
our cost of doing business at these airports."
   At Newark, for example, the airline said it was paying
gate fees it considers too high. American has recently taken
over several gates from NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines and it
said the airport was charging it $1.5 million more than
Northwest had paid annually.
   At the two Florida airports, American was quibbling with
what it considered unreasonably high airport operating
budgets. Typically, airports pass along increases in their
operating budgets to the airlines that land there. In New
Orleans, the dispute centers on landing fees.
   At La Guardia, American is disputing certain construction
costs, specifically the type of flooring used in its new
terminal.
   Several years ago, American imposed similar charges on
passengers flying out of Las Vegas when it was disputing
construction costs at that airport. The surcharge lasted for
18 months, an American spokesman said, before it was dropped.
   The spokesman said American planned to keep the current
surcharges in effect for one year, after which it will have
recouped the extra costs.
