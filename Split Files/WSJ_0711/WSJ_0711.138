   Mr. Kirkpatrick resigned as president of production of the
Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures divisions of
Walt Disney Co., effective July 20. While there he helped to
oversee the production of "Pretty Woman" and "Dick Tracy."
   David Hoberman, president of Touchstone Pictures and Walt
Disney Pictures, said Mr. Kirkpatrick's departure was
voluntary and amicable. But he said, "There was a little
frustration. He wanted more personal control over films and
mangement. We continue to be very close friends."
   Prior to his tenure of more than a year at Disney, Mr.
Kirkpatrick was president of the motion picture group of
Weintraub Entertainment Group for two years. He also had an
eight-year tenure at Paramount, where his last title was
executive vice president of production.
