   About 3.6% of American transportation job holders and
applicants had illegal or abusable drugs in their systems
when tested by SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, King
of Prussia, Pa.
   The results were the first released under the federally
mandated drug testing program that began last December for
transportation workers and applicants, including airplane
pilots and mechanics, railroad employees, truck drivers and
bus drivers.

   SmithKline, a unit of London-based SmithKline Beecham PLC,
said it analyzed urine samples from 118,000 transportation
workers and applicants from Dec. 21, 1989, to June 30, 1990.
   The company said that 3.1% of 65,000 transportation job
holders tested positive for one or more of five substances:
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates and the
hallucinogenic tranquilizer phencyclidine. SmithKline said
4.2% of 53,000 applicants for transportation jobs also tested
positive. SmithKline didn't break down its results by mode of
transport.
   SmithKline said that in the general work force 10.4% of
nearly one million job applicants and workers tested positive
for one or more of the five substances. Harry Groome,
president of SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, said
"the good news is that drug use in the transportation
industry is less prevalent than in other parts of society.
The bad news is that drug use in safety-sensitive
transportation jobs can put people's lives at risk."
