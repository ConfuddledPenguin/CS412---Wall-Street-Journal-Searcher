   All Nippon Airways of Japan will spend three months
examining four passenger airplanes and intends to purchase
about 30 medium-sized jets for a total of 500 billion yen
($3.31 billion), an official said.
   The planes include the 767-X, a high-technology jet that
can seat 407 people, being developed jointly by Japan and the
U.S.; St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11 with a
seating capacity of 380; and the European consortium Airbus
Industrie's A-330, with a capacity of 385, and its A-340,
seating 262 to 295.

   All Nippon, which operates 105 aircraft and is scheduled
to receive a previous order for 20 more jets at year end, is
one of several airlines shopping for a new generation of
wide-body aircraft to replace older McDonnell Douglas DC-10s,
Lockheed Corp. L-1011s and Boeing 747s.
   All Nippon will introduce the new planes over four to five
years starting in 1995, the official said. This is aimed at
meeting increasing passenger demand from three big airport
construction projects in Japan planned for completion by the
mid-1990s.
