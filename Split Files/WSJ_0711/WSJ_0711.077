   Despite bulging membership rolls and soaring public
support, the environmental movement has found that raising
money can be tougher than saving whales.
   A weak image, poor organization and corporate wariness
have kept charitable contributions for conservation and the
environment at less than 1% of all giving in the U.S.,
officials say.

   "It's an enigma," says Jon Jensen, coordinator of the
Environmental Grantmakers Association, which tries to find
ecologically minded donors. "Almost any public survey says
the environment is one of the top three or four issues on
people's minds, but it doesn't seem to translate to their
pocketbooks."
   Individual donors, who account for 84% of all giving,
still don't seem to think of the environment as a charity.
According to a 1988 study by Independent Sector, a public
interest group, the average American household spends $375
for religious charity and $50 for human services, but only $9
for the environment.
   Environmental groups take part of the blame. Prospective
donors can be bewildered by the 10,000 hopelessly
decentralized groups competing for funds. And the groups rely
on antiquated direct mail to core constituents instead of
broadening solicitation to reach new converts. Also plaguing
the groups is the lingering belief "that if you donate to
environmental groups, they will help the spotted owl and hurt
people," says Kalman Stein, director of the Environmental
Federation of America.
   To fight this, Mr. Stein's organization -- a federation of
23 environmental groups seeking to pool fund-raising efforts
-- has expanded advertisements and started workplace
campaigns, like the United Way's, among federal and state
workers. California companies Apple Computer, Tandem
Computers and Safeway recently agreed to participate.
   Some would-be donors simply assume that Uncle Sam will pay
the environmental tab. But William Reilly, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency, says government funding
isn't likely to return to where it was before the Reagan
cuts. "There are things you can't do without private-sector
help," he says. "We've got to enlist these resources."
   Private foundations, however, have been slow to fill the
gap. Some, such as the Pew Charitable Trust and the MacArthur
Foundation, are longtime givers to conservation causes.
Another exception, the Pittsburgh-based Richard King Mellon
Foundation, last week announced a $21 million land gift to
the nation, calling on other foundations and businesses to do
the same. "We are very hopeful others will join in," says the
foundation's president, Seward Prosser Mellon.
   A few have. This year, the Nathan Cummings Foundation,
with assets of $200 million, and the Surdna Foundation, with
assets of $300 million, both in New York City, have adopted
environmental programs for the first time. A quarter of each
fund's grants will now go to the environment. The McKnight
Foundation of Minneapolis, one of the nation's largest
foundations, this month will consider such a program.
   Apparently, other foundations are also interested. At the
Council on Foundations' annual meeting in April, the
Environmental Grantmakers held a breakfast meeting in a room
made to hold 50. Some 200 foundation representatives crowded
in for the presentation.
   "For a long time environmentalists were an elite group of
middle class whites who couldn't get a broad enough base,"
says Virginia Hayes, president of the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel. Now, she predicts, "they've reached
critical mass. They'll be on a funding ascendancy for many
years."
   Right now, though, most foundations still prefer their
traditional causes -- education, health and the arts. A 1988
study by the Foundation Center reported that only 3.6% of
foundation money went to the environment. Many foundations
are reluctant to get mixed up in the movement's controversial
politics. The Ford Foundation, for example, gives to drinking
water projects in rural America and pollution-control
projects in Eastern Europe but avoids items that say
"environment in capital letters," says program officer Walter
Coward, insisting grant recipients consider jobs and
development.
   Businesses and their corporate foundations, meanwhile,
give just 2% to 3% of their charity to the environment, the
Conference Board says. Though such donors have been giving
more recently, environmentalists suspect this is less a
display of philanthropy than an effort to get activists to
leave them alone.
   The Amoco Foundation, for example, doubled its annual
contribution to the Nature Conservancy this year, partly in
reply to public pressure on the oil industry after the Exxon
Valdez oil spill. The foundation also gave land to the Nature
Conservancy in Oklahoma, near an Amoco oil drilling site, to
help ease local opposition.
   When corporate donors do give, the money often goes to
environmental law or research groups, which won't later show
up with picket signs on the company's doorstep. Says Ford
Motor Co. Fund director Leo Brennan: "You don't want to be
kicked in the shins by the shoes you buy."
   Sometimes, the company kicks back. In 1988, when the Arco
Foundation discovered that a longtime grant recipient had
started protesting Atlantic Richfield's oil exploration in
the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, the foundation dumped
the group.
   To tap into more funds, such groups as the Nature
Conservancy use a nonconfrontational approach. They don't
hassle companies about poor environmental records, and they
don't mind being used for corporate P.R.
   Chevron gave the Nature Conservancy $7 million in water
rights on Colorado's Gunnison River, and then ran TV ads to
brag about it. Toyota gave the Conservancy three trucks and
then ran a print ad praising itself. And when Arco gave the
conservancy 570 acres in Southern California, it hauled out
film crews for an elaborate presentation.
   Patrick Noonan, who started the beggars-can't-be-choosers
program as head of the Nature Conservancy and who now leads
the Conservation Fund, defends halfhearted corporate charity.
"They're going to give the money somewhere," he says. "We've
got a crisis, and we've got a need."
