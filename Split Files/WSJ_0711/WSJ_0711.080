   CHANGING SWEDEN

   Swedes, long famed for their conformity and civic
obedience, are becoming more unruly and cynical, Swedish
social experts say.
   In a variety of ways, from increasing alcohol consumption
to declining voter participation, Swedes are rebelling
against a system many no longer trust. "It has to do with the
realization that authorities and politicians don't always
have the best interests of the country as their motivation,"
said Stockholm University ethnologist Ake Daun.
   Swedes have been shaken by several cases of politicians
and business leaders who used their influence to obtain money
or political advantage. Those scandals have legitimized
selfishness, said Hakan Lindhoff, a lecturer at the Institute
for Journalism, Media and Mass Communication in Stockholm.
   Messrs. Lindhoff and Daun cited increasing tax evasion and
worker absenteeism. The average Swedish manufacturing worker
led industrial Europe by being absent 47 days in 1989,
according to a study by the Swedish Manufacturers'
Association.
                                                                                                       

   U.S.-SOVIET OIL VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   Anglo-Suisse Inc., a small, closely held U.S.
oil-exploration and production company, has agreed with
Soviet state oil company Varyeganneftegaz to develop two oil
fields in the Tyumen area of Western Siberia, Anglo-Suisse
President Gilles Labbe said. He said the fields are thought
to hold in excess of 500 million barrels of high-quality
crude oil and are now in production. He said the work will
include improving yields from existing wells, returning wells
to production and drilling more, mainly with horizontal
drilling.
                                                                                                       

   NEW DEVELOPMENT FROM NTT
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. said it has
developed a new optic-memory material capable of
super-high-speed information retrieval and greater
information-storage capacity. The new material is said to be
roughly 100 million times faster than currently available
optical-storage materials. An NTT spokesman said the new
material could significantly increase the speed with which
information can be retrieved from a computer's memory. NTT
said using the new material, a full page of a newspaper could
be retrieved in six ten-thousandths of a second.
                                                                                                       

   A SHOPPING CENTER FOR PRAGUE
                                                                                                       

   Three Japanese companies and Czechoslovakia's state-run
Slovak Savings Bank will open a shopping center in Prague, a
spokesman for one of the Japanese companies, Trans-Media
Resources Inc., said. He said the center would be set up in
an existing building at a cost of between $3 million and $7
million and would be geared toward serving foreign tourists.
It also will be used to teach management techniques to local
managers with the aim of opening other shopping centers for
the local population.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE IN AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   Australia will grant a range of benefits, including the
right to work and free English-language tuition, to the
19,400 Chinese who arrived in the country before China's
crackdown on pro-democracy students last year. To obtain the
benefits, the Chinese must withdraw outstanding applications
for political asylum and apply for a special humanitarian and
refugee status; the special category, effective Aug. 1, gives
the 19,400 Chinese visas to stay in Australia for four years.
                                                                                                       

   HELP FOR HUNGARY
                                                                                                       

   The Export-Import Bank of Japan aims to sign an agreement
with Hungary by the end of August to extend an untied loan
for up to $200 million to the East European country, an Ex-Im
Bank spokesman said. If completed as planned, Hungary would
be the first beneficiary of Ex-Im Bank loans offered as part
of the aid Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu promised for Poland
and Hungary last January.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN `TECHNOPOLIS'
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will invest $1.12 billion to develop a
scientific-research complex into a "technopolis" by 1992,
Science and Technology Minister Chung Kun Mo said.
   He said the project -- a city of science, technology and
culture -- would be built not far from the Taedok Complex,
near Taejon, 85 miles south of Seoul.
   Mr. Chung said about 23% of the required funds would come
from the government, with the remainder provided by
businesses. He said emphasis would be given to developing
such high-technology products as high-definition television
and facsimile machines.
   The minister said 32 research institutes would be added to
the Taedok Complex by 1992, bringing the number to 50, and
that a cultural center and medical center also would be set
up there.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Nairobi said the State
Department advised all Americans to defer nonessential travel
to Kenya. "Recent public demonstrations accompanied by
looting and clashes between police and rioters have made
conditions unsafe for travelers," the State Department said.
. . . A survey of world-wide gasoline prices by the
Runzheimer International management-consulting firm showed
the most expensive place to buy gas last month was Abidjan,
Ivory Coast, where the average price per gallon was $4.31.
The cheapest spot was Caracas, Venezuela, with an average
per-gallon price of 21 cents.
