   Tokyo-based Kirin Brewery Co., Japan's top beer brewer, is
revising its 1990 sales and profit projections upward in view
of unexpectedly strong demand.
   Kirin officials said that sales will total some 1.3
trillion yen ($8.6 billion), up 3.1% from a February
projection of 1.26 trillion yen.

   The company expects profit to total some 34 billion yen,
as much as 36% higher than an initial 25 billion yen
forecast.
   Officials said the company has decided to change the 1990
projections, despite an average 6.7% price increase in March,
because of stronger-than-anticipated demand for its beer.
   Sales volume, which in February was projected to rise 5%
over 1989, was up 8% between January and June, officials
said. It is expected to rise 6% for the year.
   Officials said a new beer that went on sale last spring,
called Ichiban-Shibori (First Run), has been selling much
faster than expected, while another brand, Kirin Lager, has
also been in brisk demand.
