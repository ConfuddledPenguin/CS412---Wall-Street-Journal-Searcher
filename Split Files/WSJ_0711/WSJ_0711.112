   PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper Co. reported that
second-quarter earnings dropped 19% on lower prices for
uncoated printing and writing paper and for containerboard,
used in making corrugated cartons.
   The results substantially exceeded analysts' expectations,
however, and investors buoyed the company's stock price.

   The paper, packaging and wood-products giant said its
European paper and packaging operations performed strongly,
as did specialty products, which include chemicals used in
paints and adhesives; fabrics; and commercial photographic
film and paper.
   Second-quarter earnings sank to $185 million, or $1.70 a
share, from $229 million, or $2.04 a share, in the same
period a year earlier. Sales rose 6.7% to $3.2 billion from
$3 billion.
   The results "were significantly better than I was
expecting," said Mark S. Rogers, analyst at Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding, who had pegged International Paper earnings
at $1.55 a share.
   In linerboard, used to line corrugated packaging, and
market pulp, the basic material for paper, "the down trend
wasn't as strong as I thought," Mr. Rogers said, adding that
those product areas are likely to continue to drop
industrywide in the second half.
   But while uncoated paper hurt the year-to-year comparison,
prices have been recovering quarter to quarter this year, and
"that's sustainable," the analyst said. "That product area
looks well-positioned and is on a cyclical upturn after
bottoming (early) this year."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
International Paper's shares rose 87.5 cents to $52.50.
