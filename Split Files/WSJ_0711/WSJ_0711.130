   MADISON, N.J. -- Schering-Plough Corp. announced a
temporary program that may induce early retirements, at a
pretax cost projected at "less than $15 million."
   The drug maker said the program won't affect earnings
materially. The company said it continues to project that per
share earnings will rise 18% to 20% this year. For 1989, the
company had net income of $471.3 million, or $4.18 a share,
on sales of $3.16 billion.

   Schering offered enhanced pensions to nearly 900 U.S.
employees who are 55 years or older with at least 10 years of
service. An undisclosed number of foreign employees received
comparable offers.
   The program, available until Aug. 10, gives retiring
employees an extra five years of age and length of service
for purposes of calculating pension benefits. That means
bigger pensions.
   The program applies retroactively to employees who retired
on or after last Dec. 31, the company said.
   Though it's costly in the short term to induce
retirements, many companies do so in order to lower long-term
head counts or payroll costs. Retiring workers often can be
replaced with younger, lower-paid workers, and in some cases
companies manage to get along without any replacements.
   Because of divestitures and cost-cutting moves, Schering's
head count has declined in recent years. A company spokesman
said there were 21,300 employees at the end of 1989, down
from 25,000 five years earlier. Schering said its retirement
incentives "may serve to further streamline the
organization."
   Schering closed at $48.125, down $1.25, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.
