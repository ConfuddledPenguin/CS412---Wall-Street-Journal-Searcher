   OTTAWA -- The Canadian Federal Appeal Court ruled that
Canada's Competition Tribunal doesn't have the power to
punish for contempt those who fail to comply with its orders.
   The tribunal, which was established in 1986, hears
competition cases and issues orders against anti-competitive
practices. The agency's jurisdiction was challenged by
Chrysler Canada Ltd., a unit of Chrysler Corp.

   Chrysler Canada was summoned before the tribunal for
alleged contempt of a tribunal order requiring the company to
supply auto parts to Richard Brunet Co., a Montreal concern.
It appealed the contempt case to the Federal Appeal Court,
claiming that the tribunal didn't have the jurisdiction to
punish for contempt.
   The court, in granting Chrysler Canada's appeal, said it
might be desirable for the tribunal to have the power to
punish for contempt. But the court said "it seems that
Parliament thought otherwise" when it passed legislation
establishing the tribunal in June 1986. The tribunal's
members include Federal Court judges and experts in such
fields as business and economics.
   The federal government's Bureau of Competition Policy,
which brought the case against Chrysler Canada before the
Competition Tribunal, said it was studying the court ruling
and would issue a statement later.
   The appeal court's decision is the Competition Tribunal's
second jurisdictional setback this year. In April, the Quebec
Superior Court ruled unconstitutional various operations of
the tribunal and certain merger provisions of the federal
Competition Act. The Quebec Superior Court ruling has been
appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal by the Bureau of
Competition Policy.
