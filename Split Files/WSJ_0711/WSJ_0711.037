   ATLANTA -- The Southeast is sweltering through its sixth
week of searing heat, and state agriculture officials are
beginning to worry that, without some significant rain in the
next week or two, farmers could face a disaster on the scale
of the 1986 drought.
   Suffering from below-normal rainfall and a heat wave that
has pushed thermometer readings up past 100 degrees,
Southeastern states have reported dismal crop conditions in
the past week. In Georgia, 53% of the state's corn crop and
47% of its soybean crop are rated poor or very poor. In
Mississippi, 11% of the state's soybeans received the same
rating. In South Carolina, the corn crop's expected yield is
dropping daily. A spokeswoman for South Carolina's
agriculture department said, "All our corn crop is pretty
well zapped."

   Though agriculture officials said it is too early to
tabulate dollar damages, some clearly believe these could be
high. "Unless we get some relief in the next week," Bryan
Patrick, a federal agriculture official in South Carolina,
said, "we're going to repeat 1986."
   It was then that the drought-stricken Southeast, faced
with hundreds of millions of dollars in crop damages, was
granted federal drought aid to assist the more than 180
counties that were declared agricultural disaster areas.
   "It's too early to write off everything," Georgia
Agricultural Commissioner Tommy Irvin said. But the dry
spell, he said, has "the potential of being one of the worst
ever."
   As in 1986, the latest heat wave is expected to have
little effect on commodity prices, because the Southeast
produces a relatively small amount of most crops. By some
estimates, Georgia and the Carolinas, for example, account
for only 3% of the nation's corn acreage and about 5.5% of
the soybean acreage. "It'll be a hardship for our people,"
Bill Yates, a Clemson University extension program
coordinator, said. "But there won't be any significant
changes in market price" nationally.
   Poultry may be another matter. Because the Southeast is a
leading poultry producer, the troubles there could lead to
slightly higher chicken prices nationwide, some people in the
industry said. The extreme heat has reduced the appetite and
thus the weight of chickens, according to the Southeastern
Poultry and Egg Association in Decatur, Ga. Chickens that
normally grow to 4.5 pounds are weighing in at less than four
pounds.
   If the heat wave continues for two more weeks, said Harold
Ford, executive director of the association, U.S. chicken
prices "could easily jump four cents to five cents a pound."
   So far, chicken deaths in the region haven't been nearly
as big a problem as in 1986, when Southeastern poultry
producers lost 750,000 broilers in the first week of the heat
wave in July. The producers learned from that experience, Mr.
Ford said, and now use more fans and other devices to keep
chickens cooler.
   By most reports, it seems that the corn crop has been hurt
the most in the Southeast. In Georgia and the Carolinas,
which have had some of the severest weather, the loss already
could amount to one-third of the expected corn crop,
estimated Peter Leavitt, a forecaster with Weather Services
Corp., in Bedford, Mass. "The heat and drought came early
enough to catch the corn during the pollination stages," he
said. At that point, he said, "it's really irreversible."
   Soybeans, which tend to do relatively better in the heat,
have been hurt, too. On acres planted in Georgia, about 10%
to 15% of soybeans have been lost, partly under attack from
insects that proliferate in hot and dry soils, said James Lee
Adams, chairman of the American Soybean Association. He said
some farmers delayed a second planting of soybeans because of
the heat, and as a result, they didn't plant 35% to 40% of
the acres initially planned for that crop.
   The Southeast's large tobacco crop, which needs less
moisture than some other plants do, has had some strain, but
has been relatively unaffected by the heat, agriculture
officials reported. Dried-up pasture has forced some farmers
to feed their cattle hay that they had intended to use later
this year.
   Some meterologists believe a temporary break in the
region's scorching conditions could come later this week.
Charles Notis, a forecaster with Freese-Notis Weather Inc. in
Des Moines, Iowa, said rains moving from the Corn Belt could
arrive in the Southeast by tomorrow, Friday or Saturday,
bringing temperatures down to the 80s from the high 90s to
100s. "For the short term, the situation is going to
definitely change for the better," he predicted.
   But Mr. Leavitt, the forecaster with Weather Services, put
a less optimistic spin on the outlook. "We're expecting to
see showers move in there, but it is less likely than we
initially thought that they will persist long enough, or
substantially change the pattern enough, to help {the
farmers} recover," he said.
