   When U.S. Federal Aviation Administration inspectors
checked security at the Brussels airport last year, the
security agents hired by Trans World Airlines flunked.
   And there's nothing TWA can do about it.

   The Belgian government insists that TWA use a local
airport-security company, Belgavia Security Systems N.V.
   "We have absolutely no control over Belgavia," says
Charles Adams, a TWA senior vice president. "I mean, we can
go out there and stand there and tell them what to do, and
they don't pay any attention to us."
   Mr. Adams complained about the problem before a
presidential commission in April. Three months later, with
thousands of Americans beginning the annual summer pilgrimage
to Europe, Belgavia -- which insists the problems are solved
-- continues to X-ray checked bags and screen carry-on items
for TWA in Brussels. Pan American World Airways and American
Airlines are in the same fix.
   That's just one example of the problems that U.S. airlines
have faced as they have mounted a huge effort to improve
security after a bomb in a checked bag downed Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The security
drive is focused on flights to and from Europe and the Middle
East.
   The carriers have been trying to install better equipment
to detect bombs, hire better screeners and give them more
training, and develop more sophisticated techniques for
spotting someone who might, knowingly or unknowingly, be
carrying a bomb in a bag. The FAA also has taken a series of
steps, including trying to post more of its own security
officials overseas to help the airlines improve their
defenses.
   But despite some progress, many of these efforts have run
into all sorts of obstacles. A new device called TNA that is
supposed to detect plastic explosives isn't working very well
in tests. In some cases foreign governments have put up
roadblocks because of parochial concerns, in the name of
sovereignty, or because of honest differences over security
techniques. And some of the FAA's efforts have been stymied,
in part, by disputes with the State Department.
   There has been "continuing improvement in security, but
much remains to be done," says Ann McLaughlin, chairman of
the President's Commission on Aviation Security and
Terrorism, which held the April hearings on airline safety.
   Security experts believe that one sign of progress is a
rapid shift away from the shotgun approach of simply
screening everybody boarding the plane. They say an
additional move, carefully screening a small number of
passengers, increases effectiveness.
   A number of U.S. carriers are adopting elements of a
system developed by International Consultants on Targeted
Security, a firm started by former security officials of El
Al, the Israeli carrier. First adopted by American Airlines,
the system is considered one of the best in the industry. By
using profiles of potential terrorists, it seeks to focus on
the few passengers who may pose a threat.
   Before each international flight, American's computers
scan the passenger manifest, checking six items, such as
passport data and itinerary, to pinpoint certain passengers.
When passengers arrive at the terminal, American screeners
again narrow the list, this time also using behavioral
characteristics.
   Passengers fingered by the list are given intensive
scrutiny by screeners trained much better than those handling
U.S. domestic flights. For example, "we train our
international screeners very carefully on how to search a
bag," says Homer Boynton, managing director of security at
American.
   Pan Am has adopted a version of the plan too. A TWA
subsidiary has developed its own version, and is using it to
handle security in Europe for TWA and, under contract, in
some European cities for UAL's United Airlines and for Delta
Air Lines.
   Another sign of progress is the rapid deployment of the
latest and most effective generation of X-ray machines, whose
screens are color-coded. Though these units won't
specifically detect explosives, as TNA machines are supposed
to do, the color X-ray devices will portray any organic
material as bright orange. Plastic explosives are organic, so
an orange-colored item on the screen tells the scanner to
take a closer look. Astrophysics Research, an EG&amp;G Inc.
subsidiary that makes the color-coded X-ray machines, says
sales are climbing rapidly.
   For every step forward, however, there seem to be steps
backward. TWA's Mr. Adams told the presidential commission
that as security becomes a bigger business, governments and
airports abroad are setting up their own organizations to
create jobs and revenue -- and requiring the airlines to use
them. "That security is not adequate for our needs," he says.
"It doesn't measure up to our standards."
   According to Mr. Adams, an FAA official visited Brussels
airport last year to check Belgavia's performance, "and they
didn't pass." After screeners asked an FAA agent questions
such as "Did you pack your own bag?" and the answer indicated
that the passenger's bags should be X-rayed, Belgavia failed
to do that. The FAA could have fined TWA had the airline been
responsible, but it has no jurisdiction over Belgavia.
   Marc Pissens, general manager of Belgavia, says security
lapses were TWA's fault because the airline wouldn't hire
enough Belgavia guards. He says the problem is solved because
TWA has increased its budget and hired more guards.
   But all three U.S. carriers flying to Brussels -- TWA, Pan
Am and American -- recently complained to the Belgian
government about Belgavia and sought permission to do their
own security. Thus far, the government hasn't taken any
action on their request, the carriers say.
   Jean Paul Emplit, a spokesman for the Belgian Airways
Authority, defends the requirement that a local firm be hired
for airport security. "Each country performs its own security
-- that's normal," he says. "Would you accept Belgian
security forces acting in the U.S.?"
   Monique Delvoy, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Transport,
adds that security has been delegated to a private local firm
integrated with Belgium police forces because the government
doesn't have enough officers itself. "What we don't want is
uncontrolled development of other private security firms,
whose uniforms might be obtained by terrorists and used as a
disguise," she says.
   Adm. James Busey, chief of the FAA, went to Europe last
month to try to improve relations with foreign governments,
including meeting with Belgian authorities. But Belgavia will
still perform security for U.S. carriers.
   In numerous cases, U.S. airlines are getting caught
between FAA orders aimed at improving security and foreign
governments that want to do it another way. Within days of
the Pan Am bombing, the FAA ordered U.S. carriers to X-ray or
search every bag checked in Western Europe and the Middle
East. At London's Heathrow airport, British authorities
initially blocked the move, arguing that it would create long
lines that would jam the terminal, creating a fire hazard. In
the end, the British relented.
   In Amsterdam, however, the Dutch refused to permit
X-raying of every bag, arguing that concentrating on a few
high-risk passengers was more effective.
   "We were in the middle," Tim Thornton, a former Northwest
Airlines vice president, told the presidential commission.
"Sometimes we were in violation of American laws; sometimes
we were in violation of the foreign law. . . . For six
months, it was, you know, whose jail did we want to go to?"
   A spokesman for the Dutch national police will say only
that in discussions with the FAA, "the matter has been
resolved." Industry sources say the Dutch refused to back
down, and the FAA has granted Northwest an exemption to the
new regulation in Holland.
   Airline executives have been asking the U.S. government to
play a greater role. "If we walk into a government and say we
want to do X, Y and Z at your airport to improve security and
they say no to us, what do we do?" asks Mr. Adams of TWA.
"What we're looking for is the FAA to come forward and be the
negotiator."
   For over a year the FAA has been trying to do that, in
part by seeking to deploy 27 security agents abroad. They
would make suggestions, help U.S. carriers deal with foreign
authorities and report major problems to officials in
Washington.
   But the agency has run into resistance from several U.S.
ambassadors. The diplomats play a major role in deciding who
is posted to their embassies and, according to a State
Department document, some object to the FAA security
officials for several reasons: The FAA agents might not have
enough to do, costs might be high, and the ambassadors worry
about encroaching on host-country sovereignty.
   For months the FAA and its parent agency, the Department
of Transportation, have been locked in negotiations with the
State Department and the ambassadors. In the process the
proposed FAA security force has been cut from 27 to 21.
   To further bolster the U.S. airlines in dealing with
foreign governments, the presidential commission recommended
that the State Department create the post of coordinator for
international aviation security, with ambassadorial rank. The
State Department has yet to act.
   Foreign labor unions also can pose problems, as they are
doing for American Airlines. To test its own security, the
carrier, a unit of AMR, has hired a former Dallas bomb-squad
officer who builds simulated bombs and conceals them in bags.
Each month American employees are sent without advance
warning to European terminals with the concealed "bombs" to
see if the airline's screeners will ask the right questions
and search thoroughly enough. (Asked how often "bombs" get
through, Mr. Boynton will say only: "Not very often.")
   In most cities, American employees carrying the simulated
bombs wear hidden tape recorders so a screener's questioning
can be analyzed later, and improved if necessary. But at
Frankfurt, the Works Council, a powerful labor-management
group that functions at nearly every company in Germany,
won't permit taping. Labor representatives apparently fear
tapes might be used as evidence to justify dismissal of a
screener who does poorly.
   Even when carriers can implement tougher security
procedures, their own employees can foul things up. An FAA
rule imposed after Lockerbie bars flights in Europe and the
Middle East from taking off with unaccompanied bags. The idea
is to foil a bomber who checks a bag with an explosive device
and then doesn't board.
   Just last month, agents at a European terminal for one
U.S. airline thought all passengers were aboard a flight,
which then took off for New York. Later, a passenger appeared
at the gate; he had missed the flight, but his checked bag
hadn't.
   Worried airline security officials radioed the jet, which
by then was high over the North Atlantic. The pilot turned
and flew back to London, where the plane stayed overnight. A
search of the bag uncovered no bomb, but the flight was
delayed by a day and the airline incurred an estimated
$100,000 in extra costs.
   Machines using TNA, or thermo neutron activation, had been
touted as the ultimate solution to bomb detection. But they
are running into problems too. The one TNA device now in test
operation, at TWA's terminal at Kennedy airport in New York,
is too slow.
   At Kennedy, virtually all flights from Europe come in
during the early afternoon and leave in the late afternoon.
That means almost all bags going through TWA's terminal must
be handled within a couple of hours. In those hours, the TNA
machine handles only about 400 bags, or enough for one
flight.
   The TNA machine also has a high falsealarm rate, about 8%.
This brings screening to a crawl because bags triggering the
false alarms must go through the machine again or be
hand-searched.
   Worst of all, the machine is calibrated in such a way that
it wouldn't detect a small bomb like the one that brought
down Pan Am 103. But if the machine were set to detect small
bombs, its false alarm rate could soar as high as 20%,
industry sources say.
   The machines, about 45 feet long, also take up too much
room, airlines say. To process every bag at Kennedy airport,
"we would need an army of machines that would take up half
our terminal," says TWA's Mr. Adams. The FAA, which had
proposed that U.S. carriers be required to buy 150 of the $1
million machines and install them at airports around the
world, is holding off.
   A number of airline security officials believe, however,
that the TNA machine or a unit using another technology will
be developed with reduced size and improved capabilities, and
eventually will become practical to use. There also are hopes
that European governments may become more cooperative.
   U.S. airline officials say that the French have become
much more concerned about security since a terrorist bomb
brought down a French UTA airliner over North Africa last
September, killing all 171 on board. UTA has hired Fairfax
Group, a security consultant based near Washington, D.C., to
help improve defenses.
   Still, the job of stopping bombs remains daunting. "The
industry will board 1.1 billion passengers this year, and
we're looking for just one or two bombs," says American's Mr.
Boynton. Moreover, as the carriers tighten security in Europe
and the Middle East, some security experts think terrorists
will shift to putting bombs on planes in Africa or Latin
America, where security is considered abysmally weak.
   "We are making significant progress," says Frank Moss, an
official in the State Department's counterterrorism office,
"but as terrorists develop new tactics and technologies, we
will continue to have to do more."
