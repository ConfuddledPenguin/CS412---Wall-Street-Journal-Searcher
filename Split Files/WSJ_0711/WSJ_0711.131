   BELMONT, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. posted a 58%
increase in fourth-quarter earnings after a disappointing
third quarter.
   Oracle said net income for the quarter ended May 31 was a
record $53 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $33.5
million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue was up 55% to a record $334.4 million from $215.9
million.

   The results are in contrast to the software company's flat
income growth in the third quarter, when Oracle broke a
five-year streak of rapid growth. The poor results caused its
stock to plunge 31% to $17.5 in one day. The stock began
climbing again in May, closing at $22.375, up 87.5 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. The
fourth-quarter results were announced after the close of
trading.
   Oracle attributed the improved earnings, in part, to
improved cash flow and stronger-than-expected cash
collections for the quarter. Last March, the company blamed
its third-quarter debacle on accounting glitches and said it
would resume high growth in the fourth quarter. The flat
third quarter shook Wall Street out of a long love affair
with Oracle, which had quarterly net growth rates in 1989
ranging from 65% to 84%.
   For the fiscal year, Oracle said, net income was up 44% to
$117.4 million, or 86 cents a share, from $81.8 million, or
61 cents a share the previous fiscal year. Revenue increased
66% to $971 million from $584 million.
