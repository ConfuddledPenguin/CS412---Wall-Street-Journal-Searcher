   Concerning your May 22 article "Raytheon Wins Army
Contract of $414 Million," I find it very interesting how
this wonderful country of ours and its leaders have developed
a unique system of social/economic benefits. For those in
need, welfare programs have always been, if not grudgingly
promulgated, done so in a way to make recipients of benefits
feel somewhat less than full, productive citizens.
   When it comes to industry, as very clearly noted, there
seems to be an air of what a nice thing has been
accomplished. Avoiding layoffs, as by this "Army contract"
(God forbid it should be called a welfare program), is
laudable insofar as the workers are concerned, but one
wonders whether a cheese-manufacturer client of mine in
Brooklyn, whose business has fallen off, might be helped by a
Pentagon contract for a few tons of cheese so as to keep his
work force employed.
