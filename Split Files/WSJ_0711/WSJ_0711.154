   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Encore Computer Corp. said it
expects to report a significant second-quarter loss. The
company also said it plans to lay off about 130 employees
from its staff of 1,825 workers.
   Encore, after years of struggling, appeared to be poised
for a turnaround in April 1989, when it acquired Gould Inc.'s
computer business from Nippon Mining Co. of Japan. At a
stroke, Encore increased its sales sixfold, acquired a big
presence in Europe, and quintupled its sales force to 165
people.

   Yesterday, however, Encore's chairman and chief executive
officer, Kenneth G. Fisher, said that a revenue shortfall and
restructuring costs linked to new product introductions would
result in a sizable loss for the second quarter.
   The company declined to estimate the loss, saying it would
report final results in about two weeks. For the year-earlier
period, Encore had a net loss of $14.9 million, or 48 cents a
share, on revenue of $41.5 million.
   The new products are Encore's Seahawk and Gemini computer
systems, used primarily in flight simulators to train
military and commercial pilots. A company spokesman said the
revenue shortfall stemmed from a gap in sales as the company
moved to bring the new products to market. The Seahawk
computers, the spokesman said, are now being shipped to
customers, and the Gemini systems will start to be shipped in
the fourth quarter.
   The restructuring costs, Encore said, would result in the
layoff of about 130 people. The company spokesman said the
cutbacks will be made "across the board," in such departments
as manufacturing, finance and customer service.
   Despite the setback in the second quarter, Mr. Fisher,
citing the company's focus on its new products, said:
"Revenue could return to profitable levels in the third
quarter."
