   NEW YORK -- Small investors won a court victory that gives
them greater freedom to choose the battlefield in bringing
arbitration cases against their brokers.
   In a 6-0 decision, the New York State Court of Appeals
ruled that customers can choose to bring their disputes with
brokers to an independent arbitration panel -- not only to a
forum subsidized by the securities industry.

   The ruling by New York's highest court, affirming a
decision by the New York State Supreme Court early last year,
will affect hundreds of thousands of investors, according to
court papers filed by the Securities Industry Association.
   The appellate decision could set a nationwide pattern.
That's because most brokerage agreements are governed by the
laws of New York state, where many big securities firms are
based. Moreover, federal courts typically follow state court
interpretations involving contract language, arbitration
specialists say.
   The ruling will be welcomed by a number of investors who
have expressed a desire to have disputes resolved by panels
that don't have strong ties to the securities business.
   "This increases the odds that an investor is going to have
his way" if he wants to take a brokerage dispute to an
independent panel, says Richard Ryder, editor of the
Securities Arbitration Commentator and a former director of
arbitration at the National Association of Securities
Dealers.
   Many investors sign a standard agreement when they open a
brokerage account that binds them to pursuing arbitration
rather than filing a lawsuit in case of dispute. Under
yesterday's ruling they still won't be allowed to take their
squabbles to court.
   For years, however, many customers have been required by
the agreements to take their cases to industry-sponsored
forums. Such panels typically consist of three arbitrators,
including one securities executive and sometimes other people
with ties to Wall Street.
   The major independent forum, the American Arbitration
Association, is privately funded and widely perceived to be
the most sympathetic to investors. Customers win about 60% of
the time at the American Arbitration Association, compared
with about 50% at exchange-sponsored forums, arbitration
specialists say.
   Yesterday's appellate decision stemmed from a case brought
by a customer of Cowen &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. The
investor, Jeffrey Anderson, signed a brokerage agreement that
contained clauses saying any dispute should be settled by
arbitration in "accordance with the rules then in effect" at
the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or NASD.
When a dispute arose, Mr. Anderson wanted to bring the case
to the American Arbitration Association; Cowen said he could
only go to three industry-sponsored forums under terms of the
agreement.
   But the appellate court, in a seven-page ruling, noted
that American Stock Exchange rules allow investors to go to
the American Arbitration Association unless they have agreed
in writing to submit only to the exchange's arbitration
procedure.
   "Inasmuch as {Mr. Anderson} did not agree to limit the
arbitration to the self-regulatory organizations, the plain
language of the {brokerage} agreements grant him the right
under the Amex constitution to elect to arbitrate the dispute
before the AAA," the court said.
   The state appellate court decision runs counter to a
recent federal appeals court decision. In May, the U.S.
Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled that
investors couldn't go to the AAA under the Amex constitution.
But Mr. Ryder and other arbitration specialists say federal
courts should follow state law, which typically handle
arbitration appeals.
   "This decision trumps what the second circuit did," says
Theodore Eppenstein, a New York lawyer representing Mr.
Anderson.
   Lawrence Liebowitz, Cowen's general counsel, hadn't seen a
copy of the state appellate court decision, but said: "We
don't think the court decided correctly."
   The Securities Industry Association, which filed court
papers supporting Cowen, said brokerage firms shouldn't be
forced to allow investors the option of independent
arbitration panels. (The SIA has long encouraged its 600
member firms to consider using the AAA in customer agreements
with arbitration clauses. But most Wall Street firms still
balk.)
   Industry-sponsored forums are "as fair as can be," says
William Fitzpatrick, SIA general counsel. But, he says, if
securities firms continue to steer disputes solely to
industry-sponsored forums, "unfortunately you'll have this
perception that keeps coming back to haunt you that {firms}
are trying to trap people."
