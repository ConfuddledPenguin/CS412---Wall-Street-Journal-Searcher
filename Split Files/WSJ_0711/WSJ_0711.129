   CARMEL, Ind. -- Conseco Inc. said it agreed to acquire the
life insurance group of Lomas Financial Corp., a Dallas-based
mortgage banking concern, in a transaction valued at $165
million.
   Conseco, an insurance holding company, said it will
acquire the group through Conseco Capital Partners Limited
Partnership, which it created with institutional investors to
acquire and operate life insurance companies.

   The company will pay $140 million in cash and $25 million
in junior pay-in-kind securities for the group, which
consists of three insurance companies in Indianapolis, Little
Rock, Ark., and Salt Lake City. As of March 31, the group had
total assets of $860 million.
   The proposed purchase would be the second acquisition made
through Conseco Capital Partners. Late last month, the
partnership acquired Great American Reserve Insurance Co.
from Temple-Inland Inc., Diboll, Texas, for $143.5 million.
   Conseco said the planned transaction is subject to
approval by the bankruptcy court that has jurisdiction over
Lomas's proceedings under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code, which protects the company from creditors'
lawsuits while it forms a plan to repay debts, and by various
states' insurance regulatory agencies. The deal is expected
to be completed by this autumn.
