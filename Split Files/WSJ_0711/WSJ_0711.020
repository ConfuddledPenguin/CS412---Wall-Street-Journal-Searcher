   PARIS -- Independent French brokerage group Tuffier et
Associes is planning to slash its work force, sell its Paris
headquarters and possibly cede control to an outside investor
in an attempt to face up to lean times on the French stock
market.
   Brokers said the move could presage cuts at other Paris
firms because of the 1988 Big Bang reforms on the French
bourse, similar to the shakeout that followed London's 1986
Big Bang.

   Thierry Tuffier, chairman, said his group's stock
brokerage firm, Tuffier-Ravier-Py &amp; Associes, one of France's
five largest brokerage firms, would dismiss about 90
employees, or one third of its work force.
   The brokerage firm will shed another 100 employees by
spinning off its personal asset management business into a
separate unit in which an unidentified British insurance
house will take a sizable stake. Mr. Tuffier also said he is
negotiating the possible sale of his loss-producing financial
futures arm.
   And in what would be the most radical change, Mr. Tuffier
said he is negotiating with two outside investors whom he
didn't identify the possible sale of a majority stake in his
entire group. Until now, Mr. Tuffier's group has maintained a
fiercely independent position and was one of a handful of
French brokerage groups not to join forces with large outside
investors.
   Mr. Tuffier, who built his diversified financial services
group from a small regional stockbroker, said the days of his
independence could be numbered.
   "It is sure that in the long term this cannot remain a
personal business," 64-year-old Mr. Tuffier said, adding that
none of his four children would be able to afford to take
over the business.
   He said he already had talked to two Japanese houses but
to no avail, and that now he was negotiating with at least
two separate investors, with a deal in sight by the year end.
Meanwhile, he said, he has to cut costs.
   "Commissions are down 30% and volumes are down 15% from
last year . . . We are in a position today where we have to
restructure," Mr. Tuffier told a news conference yesterday
after a Tuffier board meeting on Monday night approved the
moves.
   Tuffier's brokerage arm had a loss of 62 million francs
($11.2 million) in the first five months this year but Mr.
Tuffier said the job cuts and the asset sales should allow
the unit to break even over the full year.
   However, stock analysts were less optimistic on the
earnings outlook for the year in view of the heavy
investments that all Paris brokers will have to make to
computerize their settlement systems.
   "The Tuffier layoffs could cost around 20 million francs,
which is about what they could get on the lease-back from the
headquarters," one analyst said.
   The Tuffier group's attributable net profit plunged in
1989 to 16 million francs from 52 million the previous year.
   Tuffier is the latest and largest victim of the squeeze on
Paris brokers since the 1988 reforms. The Big Bang opened the
protected guild-like system of French broking to powerful and
well-capitalized banks and insurance companies, did away with
fixed commissions and forced the brokerage firms to invest
heavily in computers.
   "Paris is suffering the same phenomenon as London.
Revenues are falling and costs are mounting," said Didier
Fauchier Magnan, vice chairman of independent Paris brokers
Fauchier Magnan, Durant des Aulnois.
   London brokers have been hit in the past two years by a
wave of heavy layoffs as the firms that had invested heavily
after the 1986 Big Bang tried to bring bloated costs into
line with a leaner and more competitive market.
   Mr. Fauchier Magnan also noted that, in a low-volume year,
the French market remained dependent on business from
institutional investors abroad.
   "Foreign investors switch from one market to another more
and more quickly. At the beginning of the year it was
Germany, then France, now Germany again," he said.
   Meanwhile Tuffier's senior managers will be the first to
feel the pinch. Mr. Tuffier said that pay would be cut at the
highest levels in the company, starting with his own.
