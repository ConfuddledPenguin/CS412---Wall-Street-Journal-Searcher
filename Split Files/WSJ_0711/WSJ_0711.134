   BRISTOL, Va. -- Charter Federal Savings Bank said the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the thrift are jointly
investigating the embezzlement of at least $1.2 million from
one of the firm's branches.
   Charter said the scheme involved the diversion of funds
deposited by a small number of customers at the Jefferson
Street branch in Roanoke, Va., principally through
certificates of deposit.

   L. Aubrey Goodson, Charter's president, said the prime
suspect is a former bank employee who held a "responsible"
position at the branch and quit shortly before the loss was
uncovered. The former employee's whereabouts are unknown, Mr.
Goodson said.
   Mr. Goodson added that the thrift is not sure if any other
employees might have been involved.
   Charter said its previous and current bonding companies
refused to cover the loss, and the thrift said it plans to
file suit against them if no agreement can be reached.
Charter's depositors are also insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   Charter said the embezzlement won't affect its ability to
repay its depositors.
