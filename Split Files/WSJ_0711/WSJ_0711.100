   Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG's decision to throw in the towel
in its battle with Dutch retailer Ahold N.V. ends nearly a
year of bitter dispute between the two companies and also
demonstrates once again the virtual invulnerability of Dutch
defenses against a hostile takeover.
   West German Asko is a wholesaler of food and other
consumer goods, and a retailer of food and drink. Ahold is a
food retailer.

   Asko said that it would sell its entire 13.1% stake in
Ahold to a consortium of Dutch and West German banks led by
Amsterdam-Rotterdam N.V. and Deutsche Bank. The banks in turn
will privately place the shares in as wide a distribution as
possible with private investors, according to a statement
issued by Ahold.
   An Ahold spokesman indicated that no further contacts
between the companies is likely given the fact that Ahold and
its partners in the Associated Marketing Services (AMS), a
European retailing alliance, have successfully recruited
another West German company, Allkauf AG, to replace Asko as
the West German representative in the AMS.
   Analysts agree that this marks the end of Asko's bid for a
strong presence in Western Europe outside of West Germany.
