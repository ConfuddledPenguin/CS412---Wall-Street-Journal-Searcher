   WASHINGTON -- Textron Inc. agreed to pay the government
$17.9 million to settle civil charges that the company
fraudulently sold the U.S. Coast Guard faulty helicopter
engines.
   A former procurement official with another company
involved in the helicopter contract charged in May 1988 that
the engines broke down and required extensive repairs far
more quickly than Textron had promised they would. The
whistleblower, Robert Ballew, will receive 15% of the
settlement, or $2.7 million, under a federal law that
provides incentives for individuals to report fraud against
the government. The Justice Department said the settlement
was the largest-ever in a whistleblower lawsuit.

   The engines involved in the case were used in the Coast
Guard's primary drug interdiction and rescue helicopters. The
settlement, which concludes a lawsuit against Textron, will
enable the Coast Guard to avoid as much as $60 million in
costs because the company also has promised to maintain the
engines and supply replacement parts for as long as six
years, the Justice Department said. Textron is based in
Providence, R.I.
   Textron Lycoming, a division of the parent company, was a
subcontractor on a project to produce engines that would
operate 2,400 hours of flight time between overhauls, the
Justice Department said. The Coast Guard claimed that the
engines usually ran fewer than 600 hours of flight time
before requiring extensive repairs.
   Textron's Lycoming said the settlement will facilitate the
normalization of relations between Lycoming and the Coast
Guard. The company added that the settlement doesn't
constitute an admission of wrongdoing by Lycoming.
   The company also noted that provisions had been made for
the cost of the settlement and that Lycoming's 1990 financial
results won't be affected by the decision.
   During a two-year investigation, the government also found
evidence that while modifying the engines to make them
capable of flying in snow, Textron Lycoming charged the Coast
Guard for items unrelated to the approved modifications.
