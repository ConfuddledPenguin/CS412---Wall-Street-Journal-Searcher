   GORBACHEV EASILY WON re-election as head of the Soviet
Communist Party.
   The Soviet president was elected general secretary of the
party by a wide margin only hours after sharply attacking his
critics, accusing them of being out of touch with reality and
guided by "ossified ideological cliches." His speech to the
party congress was an uncompromising assault on the military
officers and party veterans who have been sniping at his
entire perestroika restructuring program. In the election,
conducted by secret ballot, delegates voted by about 3-1 to
reappoint Gorbachev as party leader, consolidating his power
as the country's supreme leader.

   A federal judge in New York rejected objections by the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters to proposed rules for
the union's court-ordered elections next year. The judge
called the union's protests "frivolous," and said the rules
are "the linchpin" in a government effort to purge the union
of the alleged influence of organized crime.
                                                                                                       

   Lower court judges ruled in Michigan and Kentucky that
sodomy laws violate the right to privacy under the states'
constitutions. The decisions reflect the success of a
strategy that was adopted by gay activists four years ago to
turn to the state courts rather than to federal courts in
lodging challenges to such laws.

   A House appropriations panel approved a nearly $30.8
billion transportation bill that would raise federal funding
for aviation and highway programs by $2.3 billion in fiscal
1991 while rejecting Bush administration cuts from rail and
mass transit. The spending ceiling for the highway trust fund
would rise to $14.57 billion.

   American Red Cross blood banks failed to notify the
organization's Washington headquarters of 224 possible
instances of AIDS contamination, according to the FDA. In all
instances, the blood banks in the Washington, D.C., region
had been alerted by doctors that AIDS patients believed they
had become infected through transfusions.

   AIDS will become one of the top five causes of death among
women of childbearing age by next year if current trends
persist, federal researchers said. They reported that AIDS
already is the No. 1 killer of young black women in New York
and New Jersey. Most other AIDS studies have focused on young
men.

   A Senate committee is expected today to begin drafting a
$289 billion defense-spending bill slashing at least 100,000
active-duty troops in 1991 while rejecting Pentagon proposals
for comparable cuts in reserve forces over the next few
years. The panel is expected to avoid wholesale termination
of costly new weapons.

   Doctors reported four cases of liver damage in patients
who took sustained-release forms of the vitamin niacin that
they had purchased without a prescription. Niacin, one of the
B vitamins, recently has been increasingly prescribed by
physicians for heart patients who have elevated levels of
blood cholesterol.

shuttles and the crippled Hubble Space Telescope.

   Italy's Foreign Ministry said 3,000 Albanians seeking
asylum at three Western embassies in their capital, Tirana,
will be ferried to Italy under an accord still being worked
out. Italian officials said they were hopeful the refugees
could arrive in Italy within two days. The Albanians are
trying to flee the hard-line Communist nation.

   Arch A. Moore Jr. was sentenced to five years and 10
months in prison and was fined $170,000 for a scheme to
extort money from a coal operator and buy votes. The former
three-term West Virginia governor, a Republican, had pleaded
guilty in April to charges of extortion and obstruction of
justice, along with both tax and mail fraud.

capital, saying they were ready to oppose pro-Sandinista
strikers who were building barricades to protest the Chamorro
government's free-market policy. Many sections of Managua
were impassable amid reports of scattered violence.
