   Paramount Communications Inc. said it will increase its
holdings in TVX Broadcast Group Inc. and may seek to acquire
the remaining minority interest in the Virginia Beach, Va.,
television station owner.
   Paramount paid about $110 million for a 79% stake in TVX
late last year, when it also acquired $30 million in TVX debt
obligations. Paramount said it agreed to purchase an
additional 757,852 TVX shares from Citicorp Venture Capital
Ltd. and First Capital Corp. of Chicago for $7.50 a share,
increasing its holdings to 83.3%. Paramount, a New York-based
movie and TV entertainment concern, said it would offer to
acquire the remaining shares at the same $7.50 price.

   Paramount last year exercised its option to purchase the
TVX stake in a move seen as an expansion into broadcasting.
   With about seven million TVX shares outstanding on a fully
diluted basis, purchase of the remaining shares would cost
about $52 million at the $7.50 a share price.
