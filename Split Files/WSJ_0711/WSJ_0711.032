   Robert H. Beeby's June 11 Manager's Journal, "How to
Crunch a Bunch of Figures," certainly points out some of the
substantial benefits that a well-designed Decision Support
System (DSS) can provide to a company. However, it also
points out how we too easily can become overly dependent on
technology and fail to use nontechnology solutions for our
problems when they are more appropriate.
   Mr. Beeby stated that with Frito-Lay's DSS it took "a
couple of weeks" (vs. "the better part of three months"
without DSS) to find out a drop in market share was due to a
store chain introducing a store-branded product and to then
formulate a counterstrategy. I was surprised (having read Tom
Peter's comments on Frito-Lay) that the Frito-Lay delivery
person for that chain didn't inform someone the moment the
store-branded chips hit the shelf. With this information it
should be easy to conclude that market share will be reduced.
We should not have to wait for the computer to tell us sales
have dropped.

   We must be careful to let the computer replace only the
information tools it can outperform. It should never replace
our own experiences and judgment. The computer should be only
one part of a company's DSS.
