   IRVINE, Calif. -- Donald M. Earhart, I-Flow Corp.'s
recently named president, was elected to the additional post
of chief executive officer and as a director.
   Mr. Earhart, 46 years old, is the third chief executive at
I-Flow since the company went public Feb. 1. He succeeds
Michael A. Pentopoulos, 44, who was named interim chief
executive officer after cofounder Eric Brown stepped down in
late February. Mr. Brown resigned because of "strategic
differences with the board," an I-Flow executive said
yesterday.

   Mr. Earhart joined the company as president and chief
operating officer in June. "I came on board with the promise
that I would become CEO in a short period of time," Mr.
Earhart said.
   His appointment to the board expands it to five members.
Mr. Pentopoulos resigned to pursue his business interests in
a number of other medical ventures.
   Prior to joining I-Flow, Mr. Earhart was vice president of
Allergan Inc. and president of its optical division. He also
spent seven years in various executive posts at Bausch &amp; Lomb
Inc.
   I-Flow is developing a multi-drug infusion system for the
home health-care market. Mr. Earhart said the company expects
to have its first product available for sale by year end.
