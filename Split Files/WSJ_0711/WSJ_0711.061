   NEW YORK -- The Resolution Funding Corp.'s sale of 30-year
"bailout bonds" was a huge success, a sign that investors are
far more comfortable with 30-year securities than the oddball
40-year variety the agency sold previously.
   Resolution Funding, or Refcorp, is the federal agency
created to raise cash to finance the government's bailout of
the troubled thrift industry. Yesterday's auction was
Refcorp's fourth, and marked the agency's return to issuing
30-year bonds after two disastrous auctions of 40-year bonds
in January and April.

   But unlike its previous bombs, yesterday's auction "was
tremendous," said Alan McClymonds, co-head of government
trading at First Boston Corp. He said that bidding for the
bonds was stronger than at some recent Treasury auctions.
   The Treasury, which auctioned the bonds yesterday on
behalf of Refcorp, said it sold $5.03 billion of Refcorp
bonds at an average yield of 8.93%, nearly 0.40 percentage
point higher than yields on 30-year Treasury bonds. At the
first Refcorp auction of 30-year bonds in October, the
average yield was 8.15%.
   The Treasury said it received a total of $15.48 billion in
bids for the $5.03 billion bonds it sold, a bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.1-to-one. That was the best bid-to-cover ratio at
any Refcorp auction and even better than on the Treasury's
own 30-year bonds in recent auctions.
   The Refcorp sale "saw unusually strong demand by any
standards, and compared to the Refcorp 40-year auctions, it
was like night and day," said F. Ward McCarthy, a managing
director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc.
   Buyers ran the whole gamut of investors. Individuals, life
insurance companies and pension funds were attracted by the
relatively high yield.
   Other buyers, such as corporations and municipalities,
apparently bought bonds as part of a complex plan to defease
existing debt. Recently, one credit rating agency and the
accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche issued reports
suggesting the credit quality of Refcorp debt is high enough
to use for defeasing purposes. The Treasury Department
encouraged the firms to issue the reports.
   "We had been working on a number of ways to increase
demand for Refcorp bonds and this was one of them," said
Michael E. Basham, deputy assistant secretary of the
Treasury.
   Defeasance is a technique whereby a bond issuer may
discharge old, low-rate debt by purchasing a smaller amount
of higher-yielding U.S. Treasury debt. The Treasurys are put
in a trust to service the old debt being retired.
   While the Refcorp bonds don't carry the full faith and
credit backing of the U.S., the Treasury guarantees interest
payments, and principal payments are secured by zero-coupon
Treasurys, purchased by Refcorp from the government.
   In a recent report, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. cited the
Deloitte &amp; Touche report as a factor that would stimulate
demand for Refcorp bonds.
   Traders also said many bond-market arbitragers were
attracted to the wide "spread," or gap, between yields on
Refcorp bonds and 30-year Treasury bonds, which yielded about
8.56% yesterday. Some of these arbs expect the gap to narrow
in the next few weeks, which should cause Refcorp prices to
rise.
   Traders at First Boston estimate that arbs purchased about
$2.5 billion of the Refcorp bonds while selling U.S. Treasury
30-year securities. The selling was one factor that caused
Treasury prices to move lower. The benchmark 30-year bond
fell 1/4 point, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The bonds briefly rose after the Refcorp auction
results were released, but didn't hold those levels very
long.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Although Treasury bond prices ended lower, analysts said
the bond market showed surprising firmness considering that
the value of the U.S. dollar sank yesterday.
   Typically, bonds prices fall in tandem with a decline in
the dollar. But that relationship may be changing, at least
when the Japanese yen is involved. According to James Capra,
senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government
Securities Inc., Treasury prices have recently held firm or
risen on days when the dollar is off against the yen. Mr.
Capra said he first noticed the pattern in early May.
   The bond market doesn't react negatively to a rising yen
anymore, he said, largely due to speculation that a stronger
yen encourages Japanese investors to jump into the U.S.
market and buy Treasury bonds, which then of course are
viewed as cheap.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
a price of 101 27/32 to yield 8.56% compared with 102 4/32 to
yield 8.54% on Monday. The latest 10-year notes ended at a
price of 101 28/32 to yield 8.57% compared with 102 to yield
8.55% on Monday.
   Short-term rates were unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Long Island Lighting Co. bonds outperformed the broader
investment-grade bond market after Monday's credit rating
upgrade from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The utility recently
settled two suits that posed threats to its health.
   Lilco's 8 5/8 general and refunding bonds due in 2007 were
5/8 point higher since S&amp;P's announcement and about three
points higher since a federal appeals court ruling on July 2
that effectively settled a dispute with New York State
concerning cost overruns at a nuclear power plant. The bonds
now trade at 90 to yield 9.90%.
   In the junk-bond market, bonds of Revlon Inc. jumped after
company owner Ronald Perelman said he would sell a 15% stake
in a subsidiary company to help repay bank debt. Revlon's
11.75% senior subordinated notes jumped 1 7/8 point to 90
7/8. Junk bonds are high-yield, speculative-grade securities
that have low credit ratings or no ratings at all.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point higher.
   In one of the largest deals of the session, a PaineWebber
Inc. group tentatively priced $870 million of New York State
Dormitory Authority revenue and special obligation revenue
bonds for the State University Educational Facility.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 5.80% for special
obligation bonds due in 1991 to 7.68% for revenue bonds due
in 2014.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were 1/8 higher at 98 3/4 to yield
7.30%.
   Ahead on the calendar, Phoenix, Ariz., is scheduled to
sell today $137.6 million of bonds, including $65 million
street and highway user revenue bonds, via competitive bid at
noon EDT.
   No large negotiated issues are expected to be priced
today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Although the Japanese yen soared yesterday, Japanese
government bonds ended weaker due to renewed speculation that
the Bank of Japan will soon raise its discount rate.
   Feeding the latest speculation about rates was a statement
by Washington D.C.-based investment advisory firm Smick
Medley International that Japan's central bank is highly
likely to boost its discount rate "in the next several
months."
   Smick Medley's report, which didn't cite any sources,
serves to reinforce recent expectations that the Bank of
Japan's grip on credit is going to remain tight and may get
tighter in the coming months. For several weeks analysts in
Tokyo have been saying that the chances are increasing that
the Bank of Japan will boost its discount rate again to
combat the money supply's explosive growth and other
potential inflationary pressures as well as defend the yen's
recent recovery.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
benchmark 10-year yen bond was quoted at a price of 86.74,
down 0.22, to yield 7.255%. (Yields quoted here are in local
terms and differ from yields calculated for this market by
U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the semiannual
compound measure to compare yields across markets.)
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-securities prices ended unchanged to off less
than 1/8 point after an uninspired session.
   Three real-estate mortgage investment conduit offerings
for which pricing details were announced Monday appear to be
off to a good sales start, traders said.
   The offerings are a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. $500
million remic from Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., backed
by 9.5% Freddie Mac securities; a $400 million Government
National Mortgage Association issue from Fund America
Investors Corp. by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., backed by Ginnie
Mae 10% securities; and a $400 million Federal National
Mortgage Association issue by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., backed by
Fannie Mae 9.5% securities.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Ginnie Mae 9.5%
were off 1/32 at 99 1/32 to yield 9.77%.
