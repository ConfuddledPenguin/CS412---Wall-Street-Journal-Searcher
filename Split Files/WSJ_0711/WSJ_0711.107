   Oil prices rallied on anticipation of a reduction in the
world's oversupply of petroleum.
   Crude oil prices were up as much as 50 cents a barrel,
enough in some cases to offset all the declines of recent
days. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price
of crude oil for August delivery rose 36 cents a barrel to
$16.94.

   Although there was debate over the likely duration of the
rally, oil analysts attributed the upturn to two major
factors. These were expectations that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries finally may curb its
overproduction and anticipation that the latest report by the
American Petroleum Institute would show reduced U.S. crude
supplies.
   Little new information regarding OPEC output prospects
came out of yesterday's meeting of Persian Gulf oil ministers
in Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd is taking a more active role
in efforts to restore stability to oil prices. But the API
statistics, released after trading closed, showed that
drawdowns in U.S. crude inventories last week were more
bullish than expected, totaling nearly 3.7 million barrels.
   Gasoline inventories also fell by 1.7 million barrels last
week, about in line with industry projections. Meanwhile,
fuel futures were stronger yesterday with unleaded gasoline
for August delivery rising 1.01 cents a gallon to 57.86
cents.
   One factor in the firming market was an interruption in
supplies of methyl tertiary butyl ether from Arco Chemical
Co. The company had to reduce deliveries of the high-octane
gasoline additive after last week's explosion at its Houston
plant.
   Still, strength in the gasoline market helped propel U.S.
crude oil prices higher. Also, some U.S. refiners increased
their field postings for the benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel to $15.75.
   Shahrokh Nikkhah, a senior vice president with
Prudential-Bache Securities, has turned "cautiously bullish"
on oil prices as a result of this week's upturn. "The $18.50
to $20 level is definitely in sight" for the near-term crude
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, he said. "I'm
looking for a move up to the $20 level after the July 25 OPEC
meeting," he added.
   But some others don't believe prices have bottomed yet.
"Prices have every prospect of remaining under pressure" at
least for two more months, said Peter Gignoux, manager of the
Shearson Lehman Hutton international energy desk in London.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: As expected, the weekly cold storage
report showed lower-than-normal movement of pork bellies out
of storage, producing a decline in prices of pork belly
futures contracts. Pork bellies are used to make bacon. The
report showed a net movement of 2.9 million pounds of bellies
out of cold storage outside Chicago. That compares with a net
of as much as 4.6 million pounds a year earlier and a 10-year
average net at this time of about four million pounds.
Analysts don't think demand for bacon will keep pace with the
supply of fresh pork bellies. Higher-than-normal slaughter
levels have increased the supply of fresh bellies at a time
when demand for pork is sluggish.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices extended Monday's declines.
September delivery copper was off 0.60 cent a pound at
$1.1675. Traders viewed the decline as a reaction to an
overbought market, in which prices over the past two weeks
rose about 13 cents on unexpected developments. Meanwhile,
one analyst said a cave-in at the El Teniente mine in Chile
last week may cause a loss of 18,000 tons of refined copper
production. Yesterday's price decline occurred even though
London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks of copper were
reported to have declined by 2,325 tons to 51,225 tons, and
Commodities Exchange stocks were off 965 tons to 19,313 tons.
Fred Demler of PaineWebber observed that world-wide mine
production of copper was off 3 1/2% in March and April from
the same months last year. Also, he noted, shipments of
copper world-wide were up 10% in the first four months of the
year from a year earlier. However, he expects demand to
soften later in the year.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices declined moderately
on Middle Eastern selling, while silver was slightly higher
and platinum edged lower. August delivery gold was off $2.80
an ounce at $357.10. September silver ended with a gain of
one cent an ounce at $4.875. October platinum was off $1.10
an ounce at $488.90. Selling of gold, thought to be by the
same Middle Eastern interests that caused prices to break
sharply on several recent occasions triggered early price
weakness yesterday. Jeffrey Nichols, president of American
Precious Metals Advisors Ltd., Toronto, observed that while
the amount of bullion sold didn't appear to be significant,
traders are so nervous about the Middle Eastern selling that
they tend to liquidate holdings as soon as it develops.
