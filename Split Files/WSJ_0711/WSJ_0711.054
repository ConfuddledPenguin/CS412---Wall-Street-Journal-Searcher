   From "The Children of Teenage Mothers: Patterns of Early
Childbearing in Two Generations," a study by Frank F.
Furstenberg Jr., Judith A. Levine and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in
the March/April 1990 Family Planning Perspectives:

   Twenty years after a mostly black group of Baltimore women
became adolescent mothers, the majority of their first-born
children had not become adolescent parents, a finding that
challenges the popular belief that the offspring of teenage
mothers are themselves destined to become adolescent parents.
. . .
   Part of this article is devoted to an examination of the
adjustment to teenage childbearing among our small subgroup
of second-generation adolescent mothers compared with that of
their mothers in 1970. An earlier analysis had suggested that
many of the older generation of mothers would fare reasonably
well over the long term. Is the prognosis for the daughters
equally favorable? The early indications are not encouraging.
More of the daughters were unmarried, and most expected to
remain single in the near future. Because of this propensity
to remain single, a far greater proportion of the younger
generation were receiving public assistance. In addition,
indications that they would leave welfare were less
encouraging. Although the daughters had higher educational
goals, more had a history of having failed a grade -- an
ominous sign for future educational attainment. Moreover, a
higher proportion of teenage mothers were neither employed
nor in school. . . . We must wonder whether these findings
portend the growth of an urban underclass.
   In addressing this point, however, we need to recognize
some countervailing trends. First, the great majority of
offspring of teenage mothers are not repeating the pattern of
their parents. Overall, out-of-wedlock teenage childbearing
in the black population has not increased over the past two
decades; indeed, it has dropped slightly since the early
1970s, no doubt in part because of the legalization of
abortion.
   Second, the availability of abortion has changed the
composition of the teenage-parent population. Once pregnancy
occurs, fewer teenagers today are forced to become parents,
making early parenthood (relatively speaking) more a
voluntary act. Although abortion is undoubtedly underreported
in our sample, we strongly suspect that more educationally
competent teenagers opt out of parenthood. Compared with
teenagers who became mothers before age 19, those who had
aborted a pregnancy were much less likely to have previously
repeated a grade in school and held higher educational
aspirations. . . .
   Although the picture of the second-generation teenage
mother is bleak, there is an encouraging side to our
findings. Most of the teenage children of the original
Baltimore mothers did not become teenage parents themselves.
Of those teenagers without children, most had completed high
school, and many went on to college. No doubt, despite great
efforts, some will be unable to lift themselves out of
poverty . . . but it is equally possible that the toehold
into the middle class they are now establishing will grow
firmer.
