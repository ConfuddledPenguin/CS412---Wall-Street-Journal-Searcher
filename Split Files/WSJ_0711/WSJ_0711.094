   WASHINGTON -- The bipartisan budget talks resumed after a
10-day hiatus, but essentially treaded water with an all-day
discussion of possible changes to the budget process.
   Negotiators said that discussion of the delicate issue of
which taxes to raise was delayed until later this week
because of the absence of such key players as Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady.

   But negotiators from both parties said they are confident
that the summit will be considering substantial
deficit-reduction packages by week's end. "In a very short
period of time, you're going to see some packages dropping,"
said House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.).
   Some Democrats have been encouraging New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, to
help speed the talks by putting forward a plan he has been
refining. But it isn't clear he is going to do so anytime
soon. Because Sen. Domenici works closely with the White
House on budget issues, his plan would be seen by all sides
as an opening bid from the Republican side.
   Although Sen. Domenici's plan is still evolving, it
essentially would trim projected spending on defense by $10
billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and projected
spending on government benefits by another $10 billion,
including increases in Medicare premiums and deductibles,
according to people familiar with it.
   The plan also outlines about $17 billion in tax increases,
including $7 billion in higher alcohol taxes, nearly $3
billion in higher cigarette taxes, $3 billion by cutting the
capital-gains tax and another $4 billion by extending taxes
that would otherwise expire. As much as $8 billion in
additional revenue, if the summit decided to raise more
money, would come from a broad energy tax.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman is pressing to
reach an agreement before Congress leaves for its August
recess, but he wouldn't say yesterday how likely that is.
"We'll know more by Friday," he said.
   The summit is slated to review detailed proposals for
restraining spending on government benefit programs today and
may also consider defense spending. Participants said they
expect to begin their first broad discussion of taxes
tomorrow.
   Secretary Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
return late tomorrow night from Houston, where they
accompanied President Bush to the summit of leaders of
industrialized nations. Aides say that Mr. Sununu has been
spending much of his time on the telephone to Washington,
talking both about the budget summit and the pending civil
rights bill.
   Administration officials and some congressional
Republicans say that if the talks fail to find a compromise
by early August, no deficit-reduction package is likely until
after the November elections.
   But some Democrats, noticing the administration's
impatience, figure that the longer the talks go on, the more
willing the administration will be to cut defense and agree
to a more progressive tax increase. They challenge the
administration's assertion that the summit can't act in
September.
   Ironically, Mr. Darman's arrival at the talks, which are
aimed at balancing the budget over the next five years, was
delayed by 45 minutes yesterday because he was testifying
before a House subcommittee on a proposed constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   The amendment, which the administration backs, is to come
up for a House vote next week. Rep. Gray, who opposes it,
said he doubts supporters can garner the necessary two-thirds
vote.
