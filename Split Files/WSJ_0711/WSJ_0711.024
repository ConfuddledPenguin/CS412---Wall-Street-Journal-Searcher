   Doctors reported four cases of liver damage in patients
who took sustained-release forms of the vitamin niacin that
they had bought without a prescription.
   Niacin, one of the B vitamins, is known to be capable of
causing liver damage in some patients in high doses. But in
their new reports in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, doctors suggest that the "sustained-release" or
"slow-release" forms sold by a large number of vitamin
packagers may be capable of damaging the liver in lower doses
and in a much shorter time.

   Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, is widely available
in pharmacies and health food stores without a prescription.
Recently, doctors have been increasingly prescribing it for
heart patients with high blood cholesterol levels because of
niacin's ability to lower LDL-cholesterol, the "bad" type of
blood cholesterol, while raising HDL-cholesterol, the "good"
type. Niacin also is one of the cheapest available drugs
capable of lowering cholesterol levels.
   Most often, doctors prescribe the regular crystalline form
of niacin. But the new reports indicate that patients often
switch, on their own, to one of the many sustained-release
forms of the vitamin. The sustained-release forms need be
taken less frequently during the day, and are less likely to
cause unpleasant flushing of the face, which the vitamin
sometimes induces.
   In one of the new reports, two doctors at the University
of Alabama in Birmingham and their colleague, a doctor at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, describe three
patients who developed drug-induced hepatitis after taking
sustained-release forms of niacin.
   One, a 62-year-old man with a high cholesterol level, had
been taking 4,000 milligrams of crystalline niacin a day as
prescribed by his doctor. Five days after he switched on his
own to a sustained-release niacin, he fainted and was taken
to the hospital, where laboratory tests indicated liver
damage. He recovered and subsequently resumed using the
crystalline niacin without any problems, Jere P. Segrest of
the University of Alabama and his colleagues reported.
   Similar episodes of liver damage were experienced by a
50-year-old woman whose doctor prescribed the
sustained-release niacin, and by a 47-year-old man who
switched to a sustained-release niacin at the suggestion of
his pharmacist, the physicians reported.
   In a separate letter to the medical journal, Howard N.
Hodis at the University of Southern California medical school
in Los Angeles reported the case of a 32-year-old man who
developed acute liver failure while taking one 500-milligram
"super-timed-release" niacin tablet a day for two months. The
man recovered after 10 days in the hospital.
   "Awareness of the potentially greater {liver toxicity} of
sustained-release niacin and the fact that low doses of such
preparations of niacin can lead to the same complications as
high doses is important for both the physician and the
public," Dr. Hodis wrote.
