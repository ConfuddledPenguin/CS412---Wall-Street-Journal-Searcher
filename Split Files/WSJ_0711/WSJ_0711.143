   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its
ratings on debt and preferred stock of Time Warner Inc. but
remains concerned about the company's sizable debt repayments
coming due in March 1992.
   The ratings concern noted that Time Warner's agreement to
guarantee $650 million of debt of Pathe Communications Corp.
"appears unlikely to be consummated." That debt was to help
finance Pathe's proposed $1.3 billion takeover of MGM/UA
Communications Co.

   The agreement prompted a review of the company's debt
rating because, together with other recent acquisitions, it
would have increased Time Warner's "already substantial
financial risk," S&amp;P said.
   Pathe has said it is seeking other financing, prompting a
lawsuit by Time Warner.
   S&amp;P affirmed $1.5 billion of rated long-term debt at
double-B, and $5.6 billion of preferred stock at
single-B-plus. Commercial-paper ratings weren't under review.
   Referring to the 1992 debt repayments, extendable to March
1993, "which are expected to require refinancing," S&amp;P said
its outlook for Time Warner's debt rating is negative.
   Repeating previous statements, S&amp;P said it continues to
consider Time Warner's business positions, cash-generating
capacity, and asset values favorably, "despite the company's
aggressive financial profile."
