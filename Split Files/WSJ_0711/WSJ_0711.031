   NEW YORK -- As a novice restaurateur in such a cutthroat
market as Manhattan, Sheldon Golumbia could hardly believe
his success.
   A local TV station covered his grand opening in October.
Critics from as far away as San Francisco gave him glowing
reviews. And, on weekends, customers were lined up at the
door, willing to wait 90 minutes sometimes for a table at the
Royal Canadian Pancake House &amp; Restaurant.

   Of course, Mr. Golumbia's luck didn't last. Six months
later, another pancake place (with food eerily similar)
opened nearby, and that meant trouble.
   The coincidence was no accident. The menu of the
competitor, the Village Pancake House &amp; Restaurant, had been
developed by Mr. Golumbia's former chef.
   So began the case of the pirated pancakes, or the hot hot
cakes -- the flapjack flap if you will. And it just goes to
show what can happen when someone walks off with the Secrets
of Success.
   By the time the U.S. District Court suit was settled, it
had cost Mr. Golumbia $30,000 in legal fees. The affair also
had confused his clientele, some of whom thought that he
owned both restaurants and that one of them wasn't all that
hot.
   The owners of the Village Pancake House have now had to
alter their menu in accordance with the small details of a
court-approved settlement that goes so far as to regulate the
very diameter of the hot cakes they sell. Mr. Golumbia
sometimes takes a tape measure to his rivals' pancakes, to be
sure they are in compliance.
   "I really didn't want to go through all this garbage with
these guys, but we had no choice," says the 40-year-old Mr.
Golumbia. "We literally made a federal case out of pancakes."
   Replies Anastasios Lazarakis, who with Nicholas
Alexandrakis owns the Village Pancake House: "Drugs, crime,
fraud, so many problems in this city, and they're worrying
about the size of my pancakes? It's ridiculous." He adds:
"I've been in this business for 26 years, and I've never seen
anything like this. These people are crazy."
   Mr. Golumbia opened the Royal Canadian in a
lower-Manhattan neighborhood known as TriBeCa (which stands
for the Triangle Below Canal Street). Instead of serving
expensive little portions of something nouvelle, which is
what many New Yorkers are accustomed to in their restaurants,
Mr. Golumbia decided to specialize in pancakes -- huge
pancakes, some a foot in diameter, like those he used to eat
back home in Canada.
   He had no restaurant experience. He had worked as an
economist in Winnipeg and in recent years had sold cosmetics
in New York to stores and hotels. But he had researched his
idea. To learn pancake basics, he had spent eight months in
the Canadian countryside visiting pancake places.
   The pancake is a very old form of bread. In Shakespeare's
"As You Like It," Touchstone, the jester, refers to a knight
who preferred his pancakes with mustard. Indeed, they are
found, by one name or other, as a bread or sweet, in the
cuisines of many nations, ranging from the crespelle in Italy
to dosai in India. There are crepes in France, blini in
Russia, okonomiyaki in Japan. In the days of the American
pioneer, buckweat cakes were filled with the previous day's
leftovers.
   Today, the Royal Canadian serves 53 kinds of hot cakes
cooked on a griddle or baked. One recipe includes bananas,
pineapple and coconut; another, white chocolate and almonds.
One is made with beer.
   On weekend afternoons, Mr. Golumbia says his 75-seat
restaurant serves maybe 700 people, the average check running
about $10. Because the Royal Canadian's food costs (for flour
and eggs and other pancake ingredients) amount to only about
18% of sales -- half what some restaurants pay for raw
materials -- much of those pancake proceeds is pure gravy.
   Mr. Golumbia's problems began in November when his chef
left and he hired Joel Fuenmayor to replace him. Mr.
Fuenmayor, 36, brought in his sister, Martha, as his
assistant, and in just a few days the two of them had the
kitchen humming. But toward the end of February, Mr.
Fuenmayor, too, had decided to leave. "Everything got too
monotonous for me," he says.
   "I was shocked and, quite frankly, relieved," Mr. Golumbia
recalls thinking about his chef's departure. "I sensed
something about him. He was too mercurial."
   But imagine Mr. Golumbia's surprise when he learned that
his chef had popped up at a new pancake house in Greenwich
Village, if not exactly a stone's throw away, close enough to
be called competition. Pancake houses, commonplace in most
parts of the U.S., are, for some reason, a rarity in New York
City. Mr. Golumbia says he knew all along that eventually
there would be "pancake wars" in New York. But, he says, "I
never thought our first competitor would be our own chef."
   With rumors thick as pancake batter that the menu at the
Village Pancake House was awfully similar to his, Mr.
Golumbia paid the place a visit. It had introduced 74
"Original New York Home Made Old Fashion Recipes" for
pancakes, many of which, Mr. Golumbia claimed, were his
recipes.
   The plot thickened on the afternoon of April 9, three days
after the new place opened for business. At about 4:30,
according to an affidavit by John Taylor, Mr. Golumbia's
assistant chef at the time, Mr. Fuenmayor turned up at the
Royal Canadian, ripped pages from a recipe book, grabbed
lists of inventory and suppliers and rushed out.
   He left behind a Village Pancake House business card on
which he had written: "He who kills {sic} by the sword dies
by the sword" and "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
   Mr. Fuenmayor confirms that all that happened, but he says
the papers he took belonged to him.
   For 10 days or so, Mr. Golumbia anxiously monitored the
situation.
   Says Beatrice Puja, manager of the Royal Canadian: "We
were getting calls from people who would say, `You know, we
ate at your new place, and it isn't as good.'"
   Says Mr. Golumbia: "We realized we had to do something."
   Says Mr. Alexandrakis, who claims he had no idea Mr.
Fuenmayor's menu ideas might have been filched: "The next
thing I know, I'm getting slapped with a lawsuit."
   Filed in Manhattan, the federal suit alleged that the
Village Pancake House, Mr. Fuenmayor and his sister stole
trade secrets to create a "virtual clone" of the Royal
Canadian. In addition to evidence of menu similarities, Mr.
Golumbia submitted three black-and-white photographs that
made side-by-side comparisons of the two restaurants' actual
pancakes and French toast. Mr. Golumbia had ordered take-out
and snapped pictures.
   While Mr. Fuenmayor readily concedes that the similarities
were intentional, he felt he had refined the Royal Canadian's
formula, that the menu ideas were as much his work as
anyone's. He understands things differently now, however.
"Legally, when you work for a company and get paid, what you
do for them belongs to them, which I didn't know," Mr.
Fuenmayor says. "I thought what I did belonged to me."
   The suit was settled last month, without any admissions of
wrongdoing.
   Terms of the out-of-court settlement prohibit Mr.
Golumbia's competitor from listing pancakes on its menu in an
order similar to that of the Royal Canadian and from using
any of the Royal Canadian's pancake recipes, except for those
found in cookbooks.
   Specifically, the settlement enjoins the Village Pancake
House from selling griddlecakes that are between 9.25 and 14
inches in diameter and oven cakes 10 to 14 inches across.
(Not much is left to chance. Ten inches is defined as the
diameter of a hot cake made with a Duraware model 911T,
10-inch pan.)
   Meanwhile, the owners of the Village Pancake House and Mr.
Fuenmayor have also parted company. There's a lot of turnover
in this business.
