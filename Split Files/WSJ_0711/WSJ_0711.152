   NEW YORK -- A federal jury convicted John A. Mulheren Jr.
of one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities
fraud. But the jury appeared to be deadlocked on the
additional 26 counts.
   Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co.,
listened impassively to the partial verdict, which came in
the middle of the seventh day of jury deliberations and after
a trial that lasted nearly two months.

   The jury acquitted Mr. Mulheren's co-defendant, Leonard
DeStefano, of both counts against him. Mr. DeStefano, 33
years old, was a trader for Jamie Securities, which is now
defunct.
   The partial verdict came as a setback to Mr. Mulheren and
his attorney Thomas Puccio. Mr. Puccio had staked Mr.
Mulheren's defense on trying to discredit the testimony of
Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator who
made his debut as a government witness in the case against
the 41-year-old Mr. Mulheren.
   The jury of eight women and four men found that Mr.
Mulheren had conspired with Mr. Boesky to violate securities
laws. The jury also found that Mr. Mulheren had committed
securities fraud by manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. shares in 1985. But the jury failed to return verdicts
on the remaining counts.
   Judge Cedarbaum, who said she wasn't convinced the jury
was irreparably deadlocked, sent them back to continue
deliberating on the remaining counts.
   The jury still hasn't determined whether Mr. Mulheren is
guilty of conducting a series of trades that the government
alleged were designed to generate tax losses for Mr. Boesky's
trading firm and to help Mr. Boesky evade net capital
requirements.
   Mr. Mulheren said he was confident that he had a "good
shot" at reversing the partial verdict on appeal. Prosecutors
in the case declined to comment on the partial verdict. Mr.
Puccio also declined to comment.
   The partial verdict was returned at about noon yesterday.
When U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum polled the
jurors on their verdict, juror Arnold Falgiano replied that
he had found Mr. Mulheren guilty "with a heavy heart."
   Mr. DeStefano is now a trader at the New York securities
firm of Spear Leeds &amp; Kellogg, where Mr. Mulheren once
worked. After hearing the verdict, Mr. DeStefano said, "I
believe John is innocent. When I heard he was guilty, I was
unhappy." But Mr. DeStefano said, "Justice was served, at
least with respect to me."
   Mr. DeStefano had once had the opportunity to accept a
grant of immunity from prosecution in exchange for his
testimony against Mr. Mulheren. But the trader, who had never
earned more than $65,000 working for Jamie Securities,
rejected that offer and chose to fight the charges against
him.
   Individuals familiar with the case say Mr. Mulheren, too,
was offered -- but rejected -- a relatively lenient deal by
prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. In
1988, prosecutors are understood to have told Mr. Mulheren he
could plead guilty to a single count involving a books and
records violation to avoid being indicted. That count,
prosecutors are said to have told his attorney, would likely
result in probation, rather than prison time.
   But Mr. Mulheren dismissed his previous attorney, Otto
Obermaier, who is said to have counseled him to plead guilty
to the charge, and then hired Mr. Puccio. Mr. Obermaier is
now the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
   Mr. Mulheren gained widespread publicity in February 1985
when he set out from his Rumson, N.J., home in army fatigues
with a loaded rifle. He told his wife he was going to shoot
Mr. Boesky. State gun charges against Mr. Mulheren were
deferred on the condition that he comply with conditions of
probation.
