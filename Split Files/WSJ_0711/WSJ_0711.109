   If current trends continue, AIDS will become one of the
top five causes of death among women of child-bearing age by
next year, federal statisticians predicted.
   The researchers said that already AIDS is the number one
killer of young black women in New York and New Jersey.

   The new analysis by researchers at the federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta is one of the first attempts to
gauge the impact of the AIDS pandemic on women of
child-bearing age. Heretofore, studies of the incidence of
AIDS and its cause, the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV,
have concentrated largely on young men.
   "Unlike numbers of deaths from cancer, heart disease and
unintentional injuries, the number of deaths due to HIV
infection in women has direct implications about the number
of deaths that will occur in infants and children due to HIV
infection," the researchers wrote in this week's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   About 80% of the nearly 2,000 AIDS-stricken infants born
last year acquired their HIV infection from their mothers,
the researchers noted. This number is expected to rise
sharply as more HIV-infected women bear children. It costs
$18,000 to $42,000 a year to care for each of these stricken
infants. "As the number of pediatric cases increases, the
medical and social costs will become staggering," they wrote.
   Deaths from HIV infection in women aged 15 to 44 years,
jumped to 1,430 in 1988 from 18 deaths in 1980 in the first
year of the pandemic. By 1988, HIV accounted for 3% of all
deaths in young women and was the eighth leading cause of
death of this age group. The death rate from the deadly virus
was 40% higher in 1988 than in 1987.
   "The number of new cases of AIDS in women of reproductive
age continues to increase" with 2,825 such deaths reported in
1989, the researchers said. "If current mortality trends
continue, AIDS can be expected to become one of the five
leading causes of death {in young women} by 1991," they
forecast.
   Young black women are dying of HIV infection at a rate
nine times higher than white women of the same age. In New
Jersey, the death rate among black women was more than 40
deaths per 100,000 persons in the population, compared with a
rate of about four per 100,000 for young white women. In New
York, the death rate among young black women was almost 30
per 100,000 persons vs. about eight among young white women.
   In both New York and New Jersey, AIDS topped both cancer
and heart disease as a cause of death among young black
women, the researchers said.
