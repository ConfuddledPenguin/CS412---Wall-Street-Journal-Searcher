   WASHINGTON -- The savings and loan bailout agency approved
a new policy aimed at saving taxpayer funds by arranging
sales of sick thrifts before they are placed under government
control.
   Resolution Trust Corp. officials hope the new policy will
help trim their bulging inventory of insolvent thrifts and
induce buyers to take more of the assets of thrifts, along
with deposits and branches. Bailout officials said they plan
to test the program with about 10 thrifts over the next three
months. If it works, as many as 160 to 180 of the thrifts the
government believes may fail in the next year could be
handled under the new policy, the officials said.

   Though the new policy, which still must be reviewed by the
RTC Oversight Board, is similar to the method bank regulators
have used for years with sick banks, it is a major strategy
change in the S&amp;L bailout and is likely to receive tremendous
scrutiny from Congress.
   Bailout officials believe insolvent thrifts are losing
much of their value after the government takes them over, as
depositors take out funds and longtime management leaves the
institutions. The lower value translates into lower bids from
investors and thus higher costs for the government in
cleaning up the thrifts. Since February 1989, the government
has taken over about 460 thrifts and has sold off or
liquidated 209 of them, though the buyers often take only the
deposits and branches and the government must keep the
low-quality loans, real estate and other assets of the S&amp;Ls.
   Under the so-called accelerated-resolution program
approved by the RTC yesterday, the government will try to
market thrifts that aren't yet insolvent but that the
government believes it may have to take over within a year.
The RTC's list of about 3,500 bidders who have said they are
interested in investing in S&amp;Ls will be notified that the
thrifts are on the block. In a sale, the thrift would be
closed by the government, then reopened immediately in the
hands of the buyer. The investment of old shareholders would
be wiped out, but managers would be kept if the government
felt they hadn't contributed to the decline of the
institution.
   "We're trying to keep the institutions together," said
William Seidman, RTC chairman. "The franchise value is in the
customers, the core deposits and the key personnel."
   But Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), who heads a House
Banking Committee task force overseeing the bailout, said he
was skeptical of the move. "It shows a certain tentativeness
about the bailout on the part of the administration. After
putting 460 S&amp;Ls into conservatorships and receiverships, now
they are saying maybe we can do it another way."
   Added Mr. Vento, "This program will be in competition with
RTC. They have mountains of assets over there. I'm worried
they could stop concentrating on selling their own assets."
   Still, some people interested in bidding for thrifts said
the new policy would draw more bidders and higher offers.
John Oros, a partner in the mergers department at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. in New York, said some buyers have been reluctant
to deal with the RTC because offers can languish for many
months after bidders spend as much as $500,000 to assess an
institution's value. Under the accelerated policy, the RTC
hopes to sell institutions within 90 days after notifying
potential bidders that an institution is available.
   Under such sales, Mr. Oros said, buyers may be willing to
take more of a thrift's assets. More bidders will be willing
to spend the sums necessary to look over a thrift's assets,
Mr. Oros said, "if they know the government will respond
definitively in 90 days."
