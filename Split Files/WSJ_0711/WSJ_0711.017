   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee investigation of 36
foreign-owned U.S. companies has found that more than half
paid little or no U.S. income tax over a 10-year period.
   Largely by inflating the prices they paid their foreign
parents for goods, services and technology, a number of the
U.S. subsidiaries were able to reduce their taxable income to
almost nothing, investigators for the oversight subcommittee
of the House Ways and Means Committee testified at a hearing.

   The 36 companies reported $329 billion in gross receipts
from 1977 through 1987 but paid only $5 billion in U.S. taxes
over that period, the subcommittee's examination of tax
returns showed.
   It's illegal under U.S. tax law to price transactions
between related companies at higher than market value.
Testifying at the hearing, Internal Revenue Service
Commissioner Fred Goldberg agreed that a disturbing number of
foreign-controlled corporations are using such measures to
evade taxes in the U.S.
   "We believe that the U.S. government is being shortchanged
billions of dollars annually," Mr. Goldberg said, adding that
a number of American multinational companies are guilty as
well of shifting income out of the U.S. through excessive
transfer prices.
   The charges were made in the first of three days of
hearings into whether foreign-owned U.S. companies are paying
their fair share of taxes to the U.S. The issue has drawn
increasing attention in recent months as lawmakers and Bush
administration officials scramble for revenues to reduce the
mammoth federal budget deficit.
   Neither the subcommittee nor IRS officials named specific
companies because it is illegal for them to discuss
individual taxpayers publicly. But they spent more than two
hours in private session yesterday examining individual
cases.
   The subcommittee did say that the 36 companies were in the
electronics, automobile and motorcycle industries, areas
where foreign concerns, especially those in Japan, hold a
large share of the U.S. market. Twenty-five of the companies
were controlled by parents in the Pacific Rim and 11 by
European parents.
   Among the cases the investigators cited were these:
   -- A foreign parent sold television sets to its U.S.
subsidiary at $250 each but charged only $150 to an unrelated
distributor.
   -- A foreign auto manufacturer sold cars to its U.S.
subsidiary at an average of $800 more than it charged its
Canadian subsidiary for identical cars.
   -- A foreign company shipping trucks to a U.S. subsidiary
and an unrelated distributor in the U.S. charged almost $200
more per truck in shipping costs to the related company.
   The panel stressed that some of the 36 companies paid "a
significant amount of federal income tax" and at the same
time appeared to be paying acceptable prices in transactions
with their parents.
   But Mr. Goldberg cited IRS figures showing taxable income
of foreign-controlled corporations amounted to a far lower
percentage of their overall receipts than it did in the case
of U.S.-controlled corporations. For example, he said,
American-owned manufacturers' taxable income was 4.3% of U.S.
sales from 1983 through 1987 while foreign-owned
manufacturers' taxable income equalled 1.7% of U.S. sales.
   The IRS commissioner said some of the low tax bills could
be accounted for by difference in capital structure and by
start-up costs, since a large number of foreign-controlled
corporations in the U.S. are fairly new.
   Whatever the case, both the subcommittee and IRS officials
agreed that the tax agency has been ill-equipped to police
tax payments of international companies, a rapidly growing
area of tax administration given the surge in foreign
business activity in this country. Records, often kept with
the foreign parent, are hard to obtain. Moreover, it's often
difficult to assess the market value of a transaction between
two related companies, as the transactions often are unique
to the companies.
