   Dole Food's former president, Robert W. Fisher, 52,
recently resigned to become president of PPI Del Monte
Tropical Fruit Co., a unit of London-based Polly Peck
International PLC.
   Mr. DeLorenzo joined Castle &amp; Cooke in 1970 and has held
various management positions at the company. He is a graduate
of Colgate University and holds a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School.
   Also, Harry E. Stephens III, acting senior vice president
of Castle &amp; Cooke's Dole Packaged Foods Co., was named
president of the unit. Mr. Stephens, 40, joined the parent
company in 1986 as vice president, planning and business
development.
   Castle &amp; Cooke recently delayed indefinitely its planned
spinoff of Dole Food, because of financing concerns and
uncertainty about the tax treatment of the transaction.
