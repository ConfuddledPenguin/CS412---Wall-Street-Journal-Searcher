   Unlisted stock prices slipped a little on late-session
profit-taking after having held steady for most of the day.
   Takeover talk brightened the trading, however, and made
some shareholders money.

   Paramount Communications said it agreed to buy 757,852
Class B shares of TVX Broadcast Group from Citicorp Venture
Capital for $7.50 each. Paramount also offered to acquire the
rest of TVX for the same price. TVX surged 2 to 7 1/4 on the
news.
   United Banks of Colorado jumped 1 1/8 to 20 on takeover
rumors of its own. Shortly after the market closed,
Minneapolis-based bank holding company Norwest said it is in
talks with the Colorado banking concern about a possible
business combination.
   Meanwhile, the OTC market remains stalled ahead of the
oncoming rush of second-quarter earnings reports.
   Concerns that those reports will include a heavy dose of
disappointment have kept unlisted stock buyers at bay,
traders say. The profit statements will begin arriving in
force later this week.
   Traders say, however, that the OTC market appears prepared
to hold firm.
   "The tone of the market is good," says Len Hefter, head of
OTC trading at Jefferies &amp; Co. in Dallas. "Over the long
term, the market definitely seems like it wants to go
higher."
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was marginally higher for most
of the day, resisting session-long selling on the New York
Stock Exchange. Near the close, however, the OTC index gave
in, dropping 0.71, or 0.15%, to 460.97. The Big Board
composite index lost 0.75%.
   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of OTC institutional sales
trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, called the late-session
slip by unlisted stock prices "orderly profit-taking," and
said the selling may continue for a little while longer.
   "There's just no news to drive (prices) higher right now,"
Mr. O'Toole says.
   But Mr. O'Toole agreed that the market's underlying tone
remains firm.
   "I still think, long term, that we're headed higher," he
says.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 911 to 1,001, while
volume climbed to a modest 142.3 million shares from 118.5
million shares Monday.
   Jefferies' Mr. Hefter says technology stocks were in
demand all day, even in the selloff at the end of the
session.
   "The real action was in the tech stocks," Mr. Hefter says.
   On the OTC most-active list, Software Toolworks added 1/2
to 19 1/4, following the completion of a 3.85 million-share
secondary offering priced at $18.50 each.
   Apple Computer continued to fare better, leading the
most-active list with a 3/8 point gain to 47 after advancing
1 7/8 Monday.
   Novell added 3/4 to 55. SoundView Financial reiterated its
near-term "buy" rating on the stock, while raising earnings
estimates for the company.
   Lotus Development, however, fell 1 3/8 to 32 7/8.
Robertson Stephens downgraded its near-term investment rating
on Lotus to a "hold" from a "buy" and lowered its 1991
earnings estimate for the company to $3.15 a share from
$3.50. The successful reception of Microsoft's new Windows
3.0 software has overshadowed Lotus, the brokerage firm said.
   Burnup &amp; Sims fell 2 1/4 to 9 1/4. The diversified
telephone services, cable television and utility-services
concern said it earned only eight cents a share in its latest
year ended in April, down from 90 cents last year. The latest
year includes a $2.1 million reserve for back taxes, while
last year's profit included 34 cents a share from real estate
transactions.
   Polk Audio fell 3/4 to 9 1/2. The company said it expects
to report fiscal first-quarter net income significantly below
expectations and down from the $210,411 posted in the
year-ago period. The audio-speaker manufacturer went public
in July 1986 for $15 a share.
   Xoma gained 2 to 23 3/4. Shearson Lehman Hutton upgraded
its opinion of the stock, indicating that it expects Xoma to
outperform the market by more than 20 percentage points in
both the near and long term.
   Mycogen surged 1 1/4 to 19 3/4, a new 52-week high for the
stock. The biological insecticide and herbicide maker said
there were no corporate developments to account for the stock
activity. The company is expected soon to report a loss of
about four cents a share for the second quarter just ended,
compared with a loss of three cents in the quarter a year
ago. The company said it expects to break even this year.
   PharmaKinetics Laboratories lost 1 3/8 to 1 7/8. Bolar
Pharmaceuticals terminated a contract under which
PharmaKinetics provided clinical development services for two
drugs manufactured by Bolar.
