   It was a terrific ad, Roy Grace thought. But it looked
awfully familiar.
   Mr. Grace, now head of ad agency Grace &amp; Rothschild, was
interviewing a promising job candidate who was showing off a
portfolio full of impressive ads. Wait a second, though. One
of the candidate's "creations" couldn't possibly have been
his own work. Mr. Grace knew that for sure: He created the ad
himself, years ago.

   Mr. Grace was dumbfounded but not terribly surprised. As
he puts it, when an ad is successful, "everybody is going to
take credit for it."
   Whoever coined the cliche that success enjoys a thousand
fathers, but failure is an orphan, surely had the ad industry
in mind. At this very moment, scores of advertising
copywriters and art directors are wandering about with
portfolios chock full of ads they didn't have much to do with
at all. Usually, they were "marginally involved -- but that
isn't how they're representing it," says Judy Wald, a
Manhattan headhunter specializing in placing creative
executives. "They're riding on someone else's coattails."
   Name any successful campaign and you'll find its "authors"
tripping all over each other. The venerable "I Love New York"
campaign has had so many people claim it as their own that
it's reached almost legendary proportions in ad circles. More
recently, Ms. Wald says the Pepsi, American Express and
Energizer bunny campaigns all seem to have surprisingly large
numbers of "creators." Others in the industry mention
fragrance ads and the BMW "ultimate driving machine"
campaign, among others.
   "People steal; I'll be perfectly blunt about it," says Jay
Schulberg, an executive vice president with ad agency Bozell.
"There are people who have gotten their jobs claiming that
they created campaigns that they didn't."
   Ad industry officials say plagiarism is the exception, not
the rule -- but some of the exceptions are as cheeky as they
get. Mr. Schulberg recalls that after he created a campaign
for Countrytime lemonade, his wife returned home from the
supermarket in Westhampton, a Long Island beach resort, to
report that she overheard a young man attempting to pick up a
young woman. His surefire come-on: "I'm in advertising. I
created the Countrytime lemonade campaign."
   Ralph Ammirati, co-chairman and creative director of
Ammirati &amp; Puris, says he is amazed by the number of people
who supposedly "created" the "ultimate driving machine" BMW
campaign. "Marty {Puris} and I came up with it way back in
the beginning. It was part of the pitch that won the account
15 years ago," he says. That doesn't prevent other executives
from loudly claiming credit for themselves.
   Indeed, somewhere out there, there's probably someone
willing to contradict Mr. Ammirati -- and that's precisely
the problem: Almost no one knows who really came up with a
particular campaign, especially a campaign that's been around
awhile. If five people were in a room when an idea was
hatched, all five might legitimately claim authorship -- and
so might scores of others working on the campaign later on.
   That was certainly the case with the "I Love New York"
campaign. Charlie Moss, vice chairman of Wells, Rich, Greene,
is generally credited with the campaign. But hordes of others
over the years have claimed authorship as well, including
various executives who staffed the account. Says Kenneth
Olshan, Wells Rich's chairman, "A lot of people have worked
on the account and made terrific contributions -- but it's a
whole lot different doing a version of something that's been
created before. The brilliance is who comes up with it in the
first place."
   To complicate matters, who's to say where an original idea
comes from anyway? Bill Miller, a copywriter with
Minneapolis-based Fallon McElligott, remembers first writing
Rolling Stone magazine's "Perception/Reality" campaign on a
napkin in a Manhattan coffee shop. But Nancy Keating, a copy
supervisor at Bernard Hodes Advertising in New York, says she
deserves some credit: A few years before the Rolling Stone
campaign, she actually wrote a similar campaign titled
"Perception/Fact" for a bank's real-estate unit when she
worked for a now-defunct Minneapolis ad agency. Adding insult
to injury, she says she didn't even come up with the concept
herself -- she "borrowed" it from a fellow staffer.
   Fallon did the ad better, Ms. Keating readily admits. But,
she adds, it proves another cliche, that there's nothing new
under the sun.

   BALDNESS ADS: Upjohn Co. is running ads for its Rogaine
anti-baldness drug that target Hispanic consumers. Television
and radio ads are running on Spanish stations in Los Angeles,
Miami and New York. An Upjohn spokeswoman said market
research showed "good potential" for marketing Rogaine to
Hispanic men.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Disney Audio Entertainment, a Walt Disney Co.
unit, named Omnicom Group's DDB Needham, Chicago, to handle
