   DNA Plant Technology Corp. said it received a U.S. patent
for a gene-based method of protecting crops from certain
fungi, including those that cause rotting in fruits and
vegetables after they have been harvested.
   The Cinnaminson, N.J., biotechnology firm said the patent
covers its process of transferring into various plants the
gene for chitinase, an enzyme that breaks down chitin, a
crucial component of many fungi.

   Many plants naturally produce chitinase, but not in
sufficient quantities or at the right time to fight off
harmful fungi, the company said. Currently, chemical
fungicides are used to protect plants.
   Products incorporating the new process would not reach
supermarkets before the mid-1990s, the company said.
