   Want to try to take advantage of Britain's 13%-plus bank
interest rates, or bet that the Swiss franc will soar in
world currency markets?
   A handful of U.S. banks are now offering special accounts
that allow depositors to invest in foreign currencies without
ever going overseas -- and without giving up the security of
federal deposit insurance.

   Whether investors should try to take advantage of the
opportunity is another matter. Speculating in foreign
currencies is a notoriously risky business, and even
professional foreign-exchange traders frequently are wrong.
While interest rates in Britain and some other countries
currently look very appealing, a sudden currency swing can
cut into or even wipe out investors' earnings.
   Still, until recently, U.S. residents who wanted to take
the foreign-currency gamble had few options. Investors could
go overseas to open a bank account. They could buy currencies
from a dealer or in the Chicago futures markets. Or,
investors could purchase shares in one of several mutual
funds designed to trade currencies.
   But an American couldn't go to a local U.S. bank and
deposit a foreign currency in an account, because U.S. banks
weren't allowed to offer foreign-currency accounts in the
U.S.
   That also inconvenienced small businesses with customers
or suppliers overseas. If the businesses kept their banking
activity in the U.S., it meant that they had to convert to or
from dollars for every transaction involving a foreign
currency. While the operations could get around that problem
by setting up a foreign bank account, they then faced
headaches like time-zone differences that precluded
transactions during normal U.S. business hours and bank
statements sometimes written in another language.
   Federal Reserve Board concerns about the effect on the
dollar were behind the prohibition on foreign-currency
accounts. Indeed, the Fed was so worried about the possible
consequences in 1973 that it jaw-boned Bank of America into
scuttling plans for such accounts. This past year, however, a
more laissez faire-minded Fed relented and permitted banks to
serve up this previously forbidden fruit as of the start of
this year.
   So far, foreign-currency accounts haven't attracted much
attention. "It's a product in search of a market," says Don
Carson, a senior vice president at First Wachovia's Wachovia
Bank &amp; Trust Co.
   That could change, however, as the accounts become better
known and more widely available. "Just look at the rising
purchases of foreign equities by Americans," says Joanne
Snyder, a product manager for Citicorp's Citibank unit.
   Citibank learned how popular foreign-currency deposits can
be with individuals when it offered Japanese consumers a
money market account denominated in Australian dollars. The
account allowed Japanese consumers to earn the higher
Australian interest rates.
   The few banks currently offering the foreign-currency
accounts -- including Citibank, First Union National Bank of
North Carolina, Wachovia and Bank of America -- are promoting
them chiefly to business customers. Only Citibank is offering
the accounts to U.S. consumers, primarily to wealthy
customers of its private bank. (Bank of America says
individuals could get foreign-currency accounts if they
wanted them enough.)
   When it comes to investment returns, a lot depends on the
individual currency -- and the investor's timing. At
Citibank, a person who put $100,000 into a three-month Swiss
franc account in March could have earned an annualized return
of 34.5%, taking into account both the interest and
foreign-currency gain. But the annualized return on a
Japanese yen deposit would have been 1.9%.
   Citibank's Ms. Snyder hastens to add a disclaimer that
those returns apply only to the three-month period in
question and aren't necessarily indicative of future returns.
   The possibility of high returns isn't the only reason to
have a foreign-currency account. The accounts can also reduce
transaction costs and inconvenience for small businesses and
others who frequently hold large amounts of foreign currency.
   "These accounts will ease companies' operational problems
as well as allow them to avoid conversion costs and to earn
interest on their money," says James E. Brady, who heads
First Union's foreign-exchange department.
   A final, but important, advantage of having a foreign
currency on deposit with a bank in the U.S. rather than
maintaining an account overseas is that each account is
insured up to the equivalent of $100,000 by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Citibank offers two foreign-currency accounts: a money
market account that pays the overnight interest rate in each
currency and a fixed-rate time deposit with maturities of one
month to one year. The accounts are available in five
currencies: British pounds, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars,
Swiss francs and German marks. The minimum deposit is the
equivalent of $50,000. The accounts can be tapped via
international bank drafts but not through regular checks.
   "So far, the people who are using the accounts are being
somewhat conservative but sophisticated," says Ms. Synder.
"Some have the accounts strictly as investments. For others,
it's a matter of convenience."
   Other banks have aimed the accounts at corporate
customers. As Wachovia's Mr. Carson explains, "We don't want
an individual without any bonafide reason to be in one these
accounts and be disappointed when a currency loses value."
   Wachovia offers the most currencies -- 21. It requires an
opening balance of $5,000 for non-interest bearing demand
deposits.
   First Union offers businesses a money market account that
requires a $10,000 opening balance and pays an interest-rate
as high as 1.5 percentage points below the overnight rate in
that currency. The rate depends on the account balance.
   Bank of America requires no minimum balance on its demand
deposit account, which is available in 10 currencies. For
interest-bearing fixed-term accounts available in six
currencies, the bank requires the equivalent of $1 million
for deposits of less than one month and $100,000 for accounts
ranging from one month to a year.
