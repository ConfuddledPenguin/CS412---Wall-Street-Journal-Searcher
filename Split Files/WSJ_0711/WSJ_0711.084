   FRANKFURT -- In the second week of German economic union,
West German officials are playing down signs of trouble.
   Bundesbank Director Claus Koehler said East Germans
haven't gone on a buying binge and inflationary potential
remains minimal. He promised that the Bundesbank "is capable
of coming to terms with difficulties" arising from monetary
union.

   However, officials in Bonn and East Berlin are watching
the spreading labor unrest in East Germany with growing
concern. Over the past two weeks, tens of thousands of East
German workers, farmers, sanitation men and even civil
servants have staged scattered strikes to back demands for
job security and higher wages. Yesterday a one-hour work
stoppage by railway engineers disrupted rush-hour train
traffic.
   Labor's complaint focuses on fears of unemployment coming
with Western competition and on having to pay West German
prices from wages amounting to about half of those in West
Germany.
   "You can't have job security and higher wages
simultaneously without large-scale job losses," said Geoffrey
Dennis, chief international economist for James Capel Ltd. in
London. Unless reconciled by policy makers, he said, the
demands could lead to another burst of migration to West
Germany.
   The labor unrest is part of "the adjustment problems when
moving to a free market," he said. "But what we are seeing is
a source of disruption in East Germany that could have an
impact on financial markets if the politicians and the
Bundesbank remain complacent in the belief that all is going
well."
   East Germans withdrew 4.5 billion deutsche marks ($2.72
billion) last week, when most of them were limited to
withdrawals of only 2,000 marks. The sum amounted to only
about a third of the 15 billion East marks in cash
circulating in East Germany's economy before the arrival of
the deutsche mark. "We are still in the process of a
normalization in East Germany's money supply, withdrawals at
this point shouldn't necessarily be unusual," observed a
Bundesbank official.
   About half of East Germany's 8,000 major companies are
expected to face a cash crunch within the next few weeks
after losing half of their cash assets to the conversion
terms set for the deutsche mark. Roughly a third face
imminent bankruptcy.
   Municipalities are in similar straits. The mayor of East
Berlin, Tina Schwierzina, said the East German capital is
verging on a financial collapse. Unless 800 million marks are
injected into the city's finances by year end, she said,
building projects employing 24,000 workers will have to be
dropped.
   On Monday, East Germans could withdraw more deutsche marks
from their bank accounts for the first time. After the week's
hiatus, the day began with long lines outside banks as
consumers lined up for more cash, or merely to check their
new deutsche mark balances for the first time.
   East German prices have shot up. Food prices often are
three to four times above previous levels. Consumers are
showing a heavy preference for newly arrived Western food and
products, ignoring products from East Germany's backward
consumer goods sector.
   For example, East Berlin's vast Alexanderplatz square was
transformed last weekend into a no-holds-barred marketplace
settled by vendors working from the backs of vans, most of
them in from West Germany for a quick profit. Hawkers did a
booming business selling assortments of smoked fish or
sausages. Racks of cheap clothing were quickly picked clean.
   East German officials have promised to crack down on
exorbitant pricing, which they say is at its worst in East
Germany's eastern extremities, where consumers are less able
to shop for better bargains across the West German border.
   Economists say that the breakup of the old East German
retail monopoly and the arrival of more West German chains
will help bring down prices. Yet more entries from the West
only worsen the outlook for East Germany's consumer goods
industries, particularly plants making shoes, clothing,
furniture, electronic goods, office machinery, foodstuffs and
chemical feedstocks.
