   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Nynex Corp. said it was awarded
three cable-television franchises in the U.K. that represent
a potential total of 219,000 households and 10,800
businesses.
   Nynex, which got a relatively late start in competing for
U.K. cable properties, applied for a total of 23 franchise
licenses. Many of the choicest properties, including those
for metropolitan London and Birmingham, were grabbed early by
such rivals as Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. Only
four franchises remain to be assigned, and Nynex is bidding
for all of them.

   In its announcement yesterday, Nynex said it was awarded
rights with its partner, Britannia Cablesystems Group Ltd.,
for the cable-TV franchise to serve England's Darlington
district, representing a market with about 34,000 homes and
1,800 businesses.
   In addition, Nynex and Britannia won a pair of franchises
to serve a total of 24 small adjacent Surrey communities
south of London. These franchises represent about 185,000
residences and about 9,000 businesses.
   Nynex, already a participant in three other successful
U.K. cable applications in the U.K., said its goal is to
attain 1.2 million potential cable and telephone customers
there. A Nynex official said the company expects to invest
about $160 million over the next six years to develop those
cable businesses.
   Britannia is a partnership of several individual investors
in the U.S. and the U.K. with interests in cable-TV
operations and television programming.
   Separately, Nynex disclosed that it was awarded two
contracts, valued at a total of $2 million, by Philippines
Long Distance Telephone Co. to provide certain
project-management services for at least three years.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nynex shares closed at $82.25, up 12.5 cents.
