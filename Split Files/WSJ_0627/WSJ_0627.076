   MERIDEN, Conn. -- Cenvest Inc. shares lost 21% of their
value as the bank holding company said it expected a
second-quarter net loss, reflecting the addition of $13.2
million to its reserve for possible losses on bad loans.
   Cenvest's directors also omitted the second-quarter
dividend.

   The company made the additional loan-loss provision after
the Connecticut Banking Department and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reviewed two of the company's subsidiaries,
Central Bank and First Central Bank.
   Like many Northeast bank companies, Cenvest has been
jarred by a weak real estate market. The company, which had
been paying out 12 cents a share as a quarterly dividend on
its about 3.9 million shares outstanding, also plans to
charge off $4.5 million of loans from its current reserves.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cenvest's
stock dropped $1.25 to $4.75 a share.
   In the second quarter of 1989, Cenvest earned $865,000, or
22 cents a share. Cenvest said that its primary capital at
March 31 was 8.64% of its assets and it doesn't expect that
figure to change after the addition to loan-loss reserves.
The company complies with the Federal Reserve Board capital
requirement, a spokeswoman said.
