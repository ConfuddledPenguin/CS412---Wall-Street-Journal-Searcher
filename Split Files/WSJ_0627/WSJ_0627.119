   Gemini Partners L.P., New York, said it informed
Boston-based Healthco International Inc. that it is
nominating seven candidates to Healthco's board in connection
with the company's Sept. 6 annual meeting.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Gemini
said that it plans to actively solicit consents from
stockholders to remove Healthco's current board and replace
it with its own nominees.

   Gemini also said it hopes that Healthco is sincere in its
efforts to explore possible alternatives to maximize
shareholder value.
   Gemini said it is nominating Kenneth W. Aitchison, Bernard
J. Hale, John K. Looloian, Robert E. Mulcahy III, Emanuel R.
Pearlman, Mary C. Webster and George A. Zurkow.
   On behalf of Healthco, spokesman Stanley Kay, of Dewe
Rogerson Inc. in New York, said the filing was "no surprise,"
but declined to comment further.
