   Almost 95% of all private civil cases filed in federal
courts never reach trial, ending instead in settlements or
other pretrial dispositions, according to a study by Rand
Corp.
   Moreover, the percentage of cases tried appears to be
declining steadily. Researchers at Rand found that about
10.9% of the cases that concluded in 1971 reached the trial
stage, whereas only 6.6% reached trial in 1986. This
represents roughly a 40% decline during the years covered by
the study.

   Because of the increase in lawsuits filed during this
period, however, the number of trials increased. The study
was based on statistics generated by the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.
   Terence Dungworth, the Rand researcher who co-authored the
report, called the proportional drop in trials "a significant
reduction." Judges may be disposing of cases by "different
methods due to the fact that the courts are overburdened," he
suggested. "Perhaps it's not possible for trials to be held
in as many cases."
   The study itself did not reach conclusions about the
reasons for the trend. But the statistics showed that
compared with 1971, a greater percentage of cases were
concluded in 1986 after judges got involved -- that is, after
motions had been filed by the parties or after the parties
met with the judge.
   Several lawyers and judges suggested that fewer civil
trials are being held because of pressure on judges to hear
the burgeoning criminal case load. "Civil cases may be
getting squeezed out," said federal Judge William W
Schwarzer, director of the Federal Judicial Center in
Washington.
   "Trials are very expensive and burdensome," he said. "If
the parties can find a way of disposing of their dispute
without a trial, that's good. If a dispute cannot be disposed
of after all reasonable efforts and the parties cannot get to
trial, that's bad."
   Judge Joseph F. Weis Jr. of the federal appeals court in
Pittsburgh said that as civil and criminal caseloads have
increased, judges have stepped up their efforts to manage
litigation effectively, and that often leads to settlement.
Judges' efforts to bring parties together earlier may be one
reason for the drop in trials, says Judge Weis, chairman of
the Federal Courts Study Committee, which has been charged by
Congress with studying the federal court system.
   Defense and plaintiffs lawyers also point to the increased
cost of litigation as one reason that parties are settling
earlier. Stephen J. Paris, a Boston litigator who is a vice
president of the Defense Research Institute, views the
apparent increase in settlements as a favorable development.
"Those cases are using up less of the judge's time and legal
expense," he said. But Mr. Paris noted that some litigants
could be settling out of "frustration" because the increased
criminal caseload means it is harder to get a civil trial.
   The possibility that frustration may be an impetus to
settlement worries even plaintiffs lawyers who often prefer
to settle cases. "Trial is the lifeblood of the system," says
Paul D. Rheingold of the New York law firm of Rheingold &amp;
McGowan. "Everyone is entitled to their day in court. If
there's some factor working that's coercing people into not
having their day in court -- which they want -- that's not
good."
   Another finding of the Rand study was that "the aggregate
performance of the federal district courts had remained
remarkably stable during the 1970s and 1980s, despite a
substantial increase in caseload during that period."
Nationwide, according to the report, "delay was about the
same in 1986 as it was in 1971" and there was little evidence
"to support the view that time to disposition has been
lengthening." That conclusion, says Rand researcher Mr.
Dungworth, "is a surprise to most people."

   PASSIVE SMOKING CONTRIBUTED to worker's heart disease,
lawsuit alleges.
   A former employee of ComData Network Inc. filed suit
against the Brentwood, Tenn., company claiming that cigarette
smoke in his work environment aggravated his heart condition.
   The complaint, filed earlier this month in a Dallas state
court, alleges that Michael Attar "suffered extreme physical
and mental pain" partly because of his "continual exposure to
cigarette smoking second-hand" while working as a sales
manager for ComData.
   Although cases against employers have attempted to link
second-hand tobacco smoke with lung and respiratory
illnesses, this case appears to be among the first that seeks
to prove that so-called passive smoking contributed to an
employee's heart disease.
   A recent study by doctors at the University of California
estimated that 37,000 Americans die each year from heart
disease caused by passive smoking. That figure is nearly 10
times higher than the number of lung cancer deaths attributed
to passive smoking in an Environmental Protection Agency
report released this week. The EPA has not taken a position
on the effects of passive smoking on heart disease.
   Because heart disease is more common than lung cancer and
results in more deaths, lawyers say that evidence linking
heart disease to second-hand tobacco smoke could spur an
increase in litigation over passive smoking. If the
University of California study is right, "we're going to see
a gigantic increase in the number of worker {compensation}
suits and probably product liability suits," says Richard
Danard, a professor of law at Northeastern University.
   A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, an industry
advocacy group, warned that "People are now using these scare
headlines as an attempt to take legal action." He says that
the University of California study is unsubstantiated and
"decidedly political."
   Litigators and medical experts say that it could be
difficult to prove in court that passive smoking caused or
significantly worsened a plaintiff's heart disease. Because
there are so many factors other than second-hand tobacco
smoking that can cause heart disease, such a case "would be
difficult to prosecute," says Marc Edell of Budd Larner Gross
Rosenbaum Greenberg &amp; Sade in Short Hills, N.J. Mr. Edell
represents the family of Rose Cipollone, a smoker who died of
lung cancer, in its suit against Liggett Group Inc., a
tobacco company.
   Still, the possibility of court battles over passive
smoking and heart disease adds a new worry for businesses
already under pressure from anti-smoking groups and employees
who advocate a smoke-free workplace.
   A company that permits its employees to smoke "does so at
great legal risk," says Mark Pertschuk, executive director of
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights in Berkeley, Calif.

   JUDGES SAY NO to proposed legislation on federal courts.
   Congressional leaders are pushing legislation aimed at
reducing delay and expense in civil lawsuits. But
representatives of the Judicial Conference, the policy-making
arm of the federal courts, told the Senate Judiciary
Committee the conference opposes a bill that would require
each federal trial court to develop and adopt a plan to cut
civil litigation costs and delay.
   The conference supports another provision of the
legislation that would create 77 new federal judgeships, but
believes more additions are needed to handle mounting
caseloads, Judge Walter McGovern testified. The Judicial
Conference has recommended 96 new judgeships.
   The bill in question has bipartisan support: Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware introduced it
jointly with the panel's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina. The committee is expected to vote on the
legislation next month, and the creation of more judgeships
is expected to pass easily. There is probably a majority on
the Judiciary Committee willing to support some kind of
system designed to manage civil cases more efficiently,
committee staff members said.
   Some Democratic lawmakers have privately expressed
surprise and anger that Mr. Biden would lead an effort to
expand the federal judiciary during a Republican
administration. The president nominates federal judges, and
the nominees require confirmation by the Senate.
   Republicans have praised Mr. Biden's action on judgeships
as demonstrating his willingness to be a conciliator on a
sharply divided committee. "Rather than take a narrow,
partisan view of the dire need for new federal judgeships,
the senator from Delaware has done the responsible thing,"
said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
   As to the case-management proposal, Judge Robert Peckham
of the Judicial Conference testified that such legislation
would duplicate a management program recently adopted by the
conference. Judge Peckham also said that as a constitutional
matter of separation of powers, Congress shouldn't interfere
with the procedures of the judiciary. He softened his
criticism by saying that federal judges have long supported
the "concerns that inspire this proposed legislation."
   The Biden-Thurmond case-management proposals had already
been made more flexible in response to objections from the
Judicial Conference that Congress was trying to
"microregulate" judges.

   MARCOS ATTORNEY says case is "fantasy" based on
circumstantial evidence.
   In closing arguments, Gerry Spence, Imelda Marcos's lead
attorney, said the former first lady of the Philippines knew
nothing more about money than how to spend it. Mrs. Marcos,
on trial in federal court in Manhattan, is accused of using
$200 million in money stolen from the Philippines to buy
jewelry, artwork and real estate in the U.S.
   "She's a world-class shopper," Mr. Spence said. "But she
is a world-class decent human being too."
   Mr. Spence told the jury that Mrs. Marcos may have helped
spend the money but that didn't mean she knew where it came
from. He said she was being unfairly held responsible for
alleged wrongdoing by her late husband, Ferdinand, who died
in September.
   "Where's the beef? Where's the evidence that she knew?"
Mr. Spence said. He said that instead of proving racketeering
and fraud charges, prosecutors had built a case based on
circumstantial evidence that is open to interpretation.
   Mr. Spence said Mrs. Marcos had no reason to suspect that
the wealth of President Marcos, who was ousted in 1986, was
wrongfully gained. "Suppose the truth is, he embezzled the
money? What's the wife supposed to do? Is she supposed to
investigate him? Isn't a woman entitled to believe her
husband?" Mr. Spence said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella told jurors
earlier this week to use their common sense to conclude that
Mrs. Marcos, who was a member of President Marcos's cabinet,
must have known where the money came from. Prosecutors claim
that Mrs. Marcos used various fronts to transfer funds and
make purchases.
   Closing arguments for Mrs. Marcos's co-defendant, Adnan
Khashoggi, will be made today, and jury deliberations could
begin later this week.

   BOWIE KUHN THREATENED with contempt in bankruptcy
proceeding.
   A federal Bankruptcy Court judge ordered the former
baseball commissioner and his attorney to explain why they
shouldn't be held in contempt of court.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram issued the order
and scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon. The judge said
that Mr. Kuhn and his attorney, Cory Friedman of Kelley Drye
&amp; Warren, had violated a temporary restraining order
prohibiting them from "commencing, continuing or prosecuting
litigation against" former partners of the New York law firm
of Myerson &amp; Kuhn, which has disbanded and filed for Chapter
11 protection.
   Marine Midland Bank had sued Mr. Kuhn seeking to recover
about $3 million in debt that he had personally guaranteed.
Mr. Kuhn, in turn, sued his former partners for the money.
Mr. Kuhn has pursued his claim in federal court in Manhattan
despite the stay on litigation issued by Judge Abram. Judge
Abram said in her order that Mr. Kuhn's action had cost
Myerson &amp; Kuhn more than $10,000 in legal fees that he should
now reimburse.
   Mr. Kuhn now lives in Florida. He is one of only a few
partners who hasn't made a commitment to contribute personal
assets to a plan that would end the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Mr. Friedman said of the order, "We think it's totally
without merit and we'll be responding to it."
