   MCI Communications Corp. said it signed an agreement with
22 banks to borrow as much as $1 billion for its merger with
Telecom USA Inc.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier,
said it will use the new credit as well as an existing credit
line and its own funds to finance the $1.25 billion merger,
which it expects to complete in late summer or early fall.
The new loan agreement is a reducing revolving credit with a
three-year final maturity, where the amount of money that can
be borrowed declines over time. A competitive bid option
allows the 22 banks, led by Bank of America, to bid against
each other to provide funds.

   MCI agreed in April to acquire Atlanta-based Telecom USA,
the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier, for $42 a
share. After the merger, MCI will still be No. 2 in the
industry, after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
