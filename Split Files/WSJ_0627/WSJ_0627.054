   Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. agreed to pay $312
million for a nearly 10% stake in Lincoln National Corp., in
a transaction that marks the largest Japanese investment in a
U.S. insurer.
   Dai-Ichi's investment in the Fort Wayne, Ind., multiline
insurer is dwarfed by the $5.25 billion acquisition of
Farmers Group by B.A.T Industries of Britain in 1988. But
analysts and investment bankers believe Dai-Ichi's alliance
with Lincoln National could signal the beginning of more
Japanese investment in U.S. insurance companies.

   Japanese financial-services companies made major
investments in several securities and money-management firms
during the 1980s, but their involvement in the U.S. insurance
industry has until now been limited.
   "There will be more globalization going both ways,"
especially since there is a growing perception that
financial-services companies will have to be both better
capitalized and global to compete in the 1990s, says William
Yankus, an insurance industry analyst with Conning &amp; Co.
   Yet, the Japanese may follow a different path for
investment in U.S. insurers than European companies have,
bankers say. In the last 10 years, British, European and
Scandinavian insurers have scooped up entire U.S. insurance
companies. Besides Farmers Group, other major acquisitions
include Prudential PLC's purchase of Jackson National Life
Insurance Co., Zurich Insurance Co.'s acquisition of Maryland
Casualty Co., and Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.'s planned
acquisition of BMA Corp.'s Business Men's Assurance Co. unit.
   Gary Parr, a managing director with Wasserstein Perella &amp;
Co. in New York, which served as Lincoln National's
investment banker on the Dai-Ichi transaction, believes the
Japanese will take minority positions when investing in the
insurance industry, the same technique they have employed
when delving into the securities industry.
   The Japanese see obvious advantages in such an approach,
according to Mr. Parr. For example, it will allow Dai-Ichi,
Japan's second-largest life insurer, to learn about new
markets, study products and distribution systems, and also
service U.S. clients through affiliated companies.
   Carol Manning at Smith Barney Harris Upham says Japanese
financial-services firms also are eager to find ways to
diversify their investments. "When they can find a
well-managed U.S. life insurance company, {it} presents an
attractive investment."
   The proposed transaction offers Lincoln National a chance
to boost its already-strong balance sheet by acquiring
capital "on a very attractively priced basis," President Ian
M. Rolland said in an interview. Analysts said the investment
by Dai-Ichi allowed Lincoln to raise equity capital on far
better terms than it could have gotten if it sold convertible
stock on the open market.
   Mr. Rolland also cited the opportunity the alliance offers
"to enter into a number of strategic relationships with
Dai-Ichi." As part of the agreement, Lincoln National and the
Tokyo concern plan to develop "reciprocal business
relationships" in the areas of investment management,
reinsurance, pension products and group health products.
   Also a plus, Mr. Rolland said, is "having a shareholder
that understands the life insurance business and will take a
long-term view." As part of the agreement, Dai-Ichi signed a
standstill pact under which it pledged not to boost its
voting stake above 9.8%, or to participate in any group
gathering shares. The pact also requires Dai-Ichi to hold the
shares into 1993, and places restrictions on how the company
can trade them after that date.
   Under terms of the agreement, Dai-Ichi will purchase two
new series of Lincoln National convertible preferred stock: a
5% stake through one issue of convertible preferred stock and
a 4.6% share through a second series of convertible preferred
within a year.
   The planned alliance will "enhance Lincoln National's
ability to deal in the global marketplace," said Legg Mason
Wood Walker analyst Frederick Sandburg. But the agreement
"doesn't mean a whole lot, short-term, in terms of the
company's earnings," he noted.
   Takahide Sakurai, president of Dai-Ichi Mutual, said in a
statement that the company considers Lincoln National "a
highly regarded and soundly managed company," adding that the
transaction "offers us a good investment opportunity."
   Lincoln National offers life and property-casualty
insurance as well as employee-benefit programs. In 1988, the
company took a $67.1 million charge to dispose of certain
unprofitable health-maintenance organizations; the remaining
HMO's recently returned to profitability and analysts
consider that once-troubled operation to have turned the
corner.
   In May, Lincoln completed the sale of its National
Reinsurance unit to an investor group that includes financier
Robert M. Bass; it received $320.1 million in cash and $75
million in preferred stock. Those funds, and the money to be
received from the Dai-Ichi plan, will be used to pay down
debt, said Lincoln.
   The agreement between Dai-Ichi and Lincoln National will
take effect after the required waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, the companies
said.
