   I was very touched by your May 17 page-one article
"Woman's World: Mothers Bear Burden of Poverty as the Men
Drift From Appalachia." Your description of the pride and
problems of Pat Sulfridge and the other women was eloquent
and sensitive. Reading stories like yours can really make
people realize how much we have and how other people have to
struggle every day just to get by.
   We are not rich. I'm an airline mechanic, my wife is a
flight attendant. We both work because we have to. But
compared with Ms. Sulfridge, we are rich. Because of your
article, we are going to try to do more to help other people.

   Your article was so incredibly biased with overt female
chauvinism that it might have been a little strong even for
the now-defunct Ms. magazine. What possessed you to allow
that kind of tripe?
   I canceled my Washington Post subscription after five
years of watching female chauvinism creep off the Style page
onto the editorial page and then the front page. It's
difficult for a lifelong Democrat to say it, but I came to
your paper to find a haven from such sickness. And what do I
find? A page-one article dripping with poorly concealed
hatred for men.
   Where do I go from here? The National Review? And after
that? Pravda, I guess. If I am going to read propaganda in
order to get the news and commentary, it might as well be in
a newspaper where I have to learn a new language.
   I am sincerely disgusted with you -- and all men with no
backbone.
