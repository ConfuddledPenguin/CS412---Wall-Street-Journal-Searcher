   WASHINGTON -- In a deliberately unassuming four-sentence
statement released yesterday morning, President Bush
abandoned his longtime pledge of "no new taxes," immediately
changing the national debate from whether taxes will be
raised to whose taxes will be raised.
   The carefully worded statement listed "tax revenue
increases" as one of the elements necessary for budget
deficit reduction. White House officials refused to
elaborate. But clearly, the president now is ready to
negotiate a budget deal with Congress that could include new
or higher taxes.

   Despite White House efforts to play it down, the message
hit here like a bombshell. Barely an hour before the
statement was released, for example, the American Trucking
Association's executive committee had assured its members
that the odds of a fuel-tax increase this year were no better
than one in three. Then came the news release. "We're all a
lot more worried than we were a few minutes ago," said
Kenneth Simonson, staff economist for the group.
   Thus, the first great economic and political debate of the
1990s is now under way: How should government redistribute
the tax burden?
   Republicans, who have been making political hay portraying
Democrats as big taxers, were quick to suggest that if taxes
must rise, the targets should be gasoline, alcohol and
tobacco -- taxes that can be disguised as "user fees."
Democrats snapped back that those taxes would hit low-income
people especially hard. Sen. James Sasser, the Tennessee
Democrat who chairs the powerful Senate Budget Committee, had
his own idea: Sock it to the rich.
   The likely result is a combination of both, something that
satisfies everyone -- sort of -- by hurting everyone. Alcohol
and tobacco taxes are at the top of the hit list, and
gasoline and environmental-cleanup taxes may not be far
behind. Excise taxes, after all, seem to be the easiest way
to close the budget gap.
   But in return, Democrats will demand that the top tax rate
on the very wealthy be increased. A deepening reaction to the
Reagan-era tax cuts of the 1980s leads many to demand an
increase in taxes for high-income people.
   "What you have now is a growing middle-class awareness
that their load is high, and maybe even higher, than the
people at the top," says Kevin Phillips, a political
consultant who has just written a book about the politics of
wealth and poverty.
   Some Republicans tried to argue yesterday that the
president's comments were nothing new. "Tax revenue
increases," they noted, could refer to the $14 billion in
additional income -- from tougher tax-collection enforcement,
for instance -- that's already included in the president's
budget. "The statement as issued doesn't reflect a
significant change in Republican policy," said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, the House Republican whip.
   But even fervent anti-tax Republicans acknowledged that
the president now appears willing to leave his emphatic
campaign pledge behind. "It's bad news, but not surprising
news," said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think-tank. From the moment that
Mr. Bush began the summit talks on the budget with
congressional leaders on May 15, "the White House was
prepared to capitulate on taxes," he said.
   While the remaining budget negotiations are certain to be
long and difficult, the best estimate now is that the budget
summit, if successful, will produce a package of about $50
billion in deficit reductions. Of that about half -- $25
billion -- may come from increased taxes.
   Some administration officials have privately acknowledged
they'd be willing to accept higher taxes on so-called "sin"
items, notably alcohol and tobacco. That move could raise as
much as $10 billion a year. And polls suggest the American
public might go along. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll, for instance, shows 83% of voters would favor
increasing alcohol and tobacco taxes if the government had to
have a tax increase.
   Gasoline taxes are also high on the agenda, along with
other environment and energy-related taxes that would spread
the costs even wider -- a "BTU tax" on all energy
consumption, for instance; an oil-import fee, or a
carbon-based fuel that would hit heating oil, coal and
natural gas, as well as gasoline. Such fuel taxes raise a lot
of money -- a 25-cent a gallon gasoline tax would bring in
$25 billion, for instance -- and they have the added benefit
of helping the environment. "If you're going to raise
revenues you might as well do some collateral good," says
Rep. Tom Downey, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means
Committee.
   But raising fuel taxes is distinctly less popular than the
idea of sticking it to the rich. The Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll in May found that in a choice between increasing
income tax rates for upper-income Americans and increasing
the gasoline tax, 68% favored hitting the rich, while only
28% preferred paying more for fuel.
   Higher gasoline taxes are also much less popular than
alcohol and tobacco taxes -- though even such products figure
in the debate over the fairness of the tax burden. In
Chicago, a coalition of labor unions and alcohol and tobacco
companies has already prepared a hard-hitting advertising
campaign that would portray such a tax increase as a kick to
the pocketbook of the working person.
   One ad shows tuxedo-clad men getting out of a very
expensive automobile. "This is a Rolls Royce Corniche
convertible," the announcer says. "If you're a
multimillionaire, you can buy one for $200,000." Then the
camera turns to a bottle of beer. "Sixty-five cents," the
announcer says. "Regular people enjoy them in their backyards
on hot summer days. . . . Guess which one the government
wants to tax now?"
   The group tested the ads in six medium-sized television
markets in February and found an impressive impact. Before
the ads aired, 55% of respondents opposed a beer-tax
increase; afterward, the opposition level rose to 66%.
   William Berman of the American Automobile Association
notes that even Mr. Bush has argued gasoline taxes are unfair
to the poor. In a letter written to the group during the 1988
campaign, Mr. Bush said, "a gas tax increase to balance the
budget would particularly hurt lower wage earners, families
with both spouses working, and farmers and residents of
Western states who have to drive long distances."
   The administration is likely to magnify the criticism by
also insisting on cutting the tax on capital gains. Although
that might have the virtue of raising revenue in the short
term, the vast majority of the tax benefits would go to those
earning $100,000 a year or more.
   Democrats have already begun their counterattack. "Any
Bush tax initiative," Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey
Democrat, said on the floor of the House yesterday, "is
certain to include new privileges and tax breaks for the
wealthy."
   To address their concerns about tax fairness, Democrats
are insisting any tax package eliminate the so-called bubble
in the current tax rate structure. Under current law, a 33%
rate is imposed on single people's taxable income between
about $47,000 and $97,000, and on joint filers' between
$78,000 and $162,000. The rate then falls back to 28% on
income above those levels. The Democrats insist that in
return for a capital-gains cut, the 28% rate should be
increased.
   The Bush administration and its allies say they remain
adamantly opposed to any increase in federal income-tax
rates. "I don't think you can give up on marginal rates,"
said Mitch Daniels, president of the Hudson Institute and
former political aide in the Reagan White House. "I wouldn't
give up on the bubble."
   But even the White House's Democratic ally on the capital
gains tax cut, Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, believes the top
rate is likely to increase as part of a trade-off for capital
gains. "If you are going to raise those top rates anyway, you
ought to get something for it, like capital gains," he said.
   Mr. Phillips, the political consultant, argues that the
post-Reagan push for more taxes on the wealthy is already
evident in a number of states. He points to New Jersey Gov.
James Florio's tax package, which doubles the top income-tax
rate in that state from 3.5% to 7%. And he notes that in
California, the Democratic chairmen of the senate and
assembly revenue committees favor raising that state's top
tax bracket to 11% from 9.3%.
   Moreover, a number of states, including New York,
Connecticut and Massachusetts, are looking at new taxes on
certain professional services, such as management consulting,
advertising and public relations. Mr. Phillips says that
these moves, too, constitute an effort to shift more of the
tax burden to the upper-income brackets.
   To be sure, no one in Washington even hints of a return to
the pre-Reagan days when the top tax rate rose as high as
70%. Some, such as New York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer,
say the goal is to make the tax structure somewhat more
progressive -- tilted more to the poor and less to the
wealthy -- than it is now. Others say their aim is only to
hold the line against a further shift in a regressive
direction.
   But in any event, it's clear that tax "fairness" has
become a rising concern, making the problem of whose taxes to
increase increasingly sticky.
   The budget summit talks, if they succeed, are likely to
provide only general outlines of a tax bill, leaving details
to the House and Senate tax-writing committees. And when
faced with the pointed debate over whose taxes to raise, they
are likely to cast a broad net, spreading the pain over as
many groups as possible.
   "If the assumption is a $25 billion tax increase for
fiscal 1991, in my judgment it has got to be a very
broad-based package," said big-business lobbyist Charls
Walker. "It has to be a package of pain that strikes out in
as many directions and touches as many people and groups as
possible."
   Thus, even new federal targets such as advertising may
reach the hit list in Washington. Some government tax
officials are contemplating a plan that would cut the tax
deduction for advertising expenses to 80% from the current
100%.
   Insurance companies may also take a hit. Stock-owned
insurance companies and mutually owned insurance companies
have been feuding for decades over each other's tax
treatment. "They're like children," says Rep. Fortney Stark,
a California Democrat. The result this year may be that both
see their tax burden rise.
   The two insurance groups have been preparing for that
possibility for months, each hiring scores of lobbyists to
push its cause on Capitol Hill and contributing huge amounts
of money to the tax-writers' campaign coffers. Six mutual
life insurance companies even contributed $100,000 last month
to a charity function organized by Chris Downey, the wife of
Rep. Downey, the mutuals' top supporter on the Ways and Means
Committee. "It's a coincidence," says Anne Fleming, who
helped organize the fund-raiser, of the insurance companies'
support.
   Other possibilities include using the tax code to crack
down on a range of perceived environmental evils, including
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions,
polystyrene packaging, and lumber cut from old redwoods. A
related possibility involves limiting the deduction for
employer-provided parking expenses, a move that would
discourage commuting by car.
   Other tax-raising options aimed at hitting corporations or
high-income taxpayers that are likely to be considered by
Congress include:
   -- Taxing Social Security benefits received by high-income
taxpayers.
   -- Taxing gains on short-term securities trades more
stiffly.
   -- Restricting a real-estate tax break permitting tax-free
swaps of property.
   -- Stepping up efforts to collect taxes from U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign corporations.
   All these options may seem like a long laundry list, but
the tab is also big. A $25 billion tax increase would be the
biggest one-year tax increase in history. As a grinning Ways
and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski warned recently at a
breakfast meeting in Chicago: "Here comes the tax man."
