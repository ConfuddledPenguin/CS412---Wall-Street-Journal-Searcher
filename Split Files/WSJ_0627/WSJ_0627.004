   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded Chase
Manhattan Corp.'s debt, including its commerical paper,
citing worsening real estate loans and a weak earnings
outlook.
   The action follows a similar move by Moody's Investor
Service Inc. two weeks ago and affects $7.5 billion in debt
and preferred stock. Most banks have received downgrades in
recent months as loan problems have risen.

   A Chase spokesman said the company was disappointed by the
action.
   All obligations of the parent company were reduced: The
senior debt dropped to single-A-minus from single-A.
Subordinated debt slipped to triple-B-plus from
single-A-minus. The rating on preferred stock fell to
triple-B from triple-B-plus, and the commercial paper rating
was reduced to A-2 from A-1.
   S&amp;P also lowered the ratings on longterm certificates of
deposit and letter of credit-backed issues of Chase's
principal subsidiaries -- Chase Manhattan Bank, Chase/Lincoln
First Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank (USA) -- to single-A/A-1
from single-A-plus/A-1. Short-term ratings for the banks'
certificates and letters of credit remain unchanged.
   Tanya Azarch of Standard &amp; Poor's said Chase's recently
announced plan to cut its annual overhead by $300 million, or
8%, is a positive factor. However, she said problem loans and
a poor earnings outlook leave Chase in a weakened position.
   Chase has $9.8 billion in commercial real estate loans, or
about 13% of its total loan portfolio. Of that sum, about
$1.27 billion is classified as non-performing or past due.
   In addition, the slack demand for corporate lending and
advisory services has clouded Chase's earnings outlook. As a
result, Chase's earnings this year aren't expected to cover
its dividend costs.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
closed at $24.25, up 12.5 cents.
