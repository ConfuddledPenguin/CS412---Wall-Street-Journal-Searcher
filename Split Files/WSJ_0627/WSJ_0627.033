   NEW YORK -- Bond and stock prices shot up as President
Bush talked tough about the budget deficit, then drifted
lower for the rest of the day. Bonds ended with gains, but
stocks closed a bit lower, and the dollar fell.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose one-half point,
or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Trading was brisk in the
morning but waned as the day wore on. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average eased 2.72 points to close at 2842.33 in
light trading. The dollar dropped against the mark and the
yen. Currency traders said Mr. Bush's remarks had negative
implications for the dollar.

   Mr. Bush sparked the opening surge in bond prices with
comments about steps the administration sees as necessary to
deal with the deficit, including possible tax increases. That
was good news for bond investors because a successful
deficit-reduction package could cut the government's
borrowing needs, thereby easing some of the upward pressure
on interest rates.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has
indicated a willingness to ease interest rates if Congress
and the administration can act swiftly to cut the deficit.
   Bond traders said most of the action came from dealers who
had sold borrowed bonds, betting on further price declines,
then rushed to buy them back after Mr. Bush's comments.
Prices began drifting lower as traders pondered, with some
confusion, what kind of taxes the Bush administration is
willing to raise.
   Stock prices exploded at the opening bell, and the Dow
Jones industrials were up as much as 30 points by 10:15 a.m.
Ben Capaldi, a partner at Brandywine Asset Management,
Wilmington, Del., said that while Mr. Bush's remarks "got
people excited earlier in the day," the euphoria cooled as
investors realized no details were mentioned and that
politicians could still flub the opportunity to cut the
deficit.
   The dollar fell because traders think higher taxes would
weaken the U.S. economy and cause the Fed to ease interest
rates. Such a step would make the dollar less attractive than
some other major currencies.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices edged lower on volume of 141.4 million shares
in New York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues
outnumbered advancers 752-706.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6630 marks and 154.67 yen, compared with
1.6770 marks and 155.35 yen late Monday.
