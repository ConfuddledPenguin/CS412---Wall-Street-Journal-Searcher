   Why would bankers shell out $20 million more in loans to a
man who already owes $3.3 billion and appears to have little
prospect of meeting all of his debt payments on his own? Fear
of bankruptcy court appears to be the best answer.
   On paper, developer Donald Trump could be a perfect
candidate to seek formal protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. He owes money to a
dizzying array of suppliers, banks and bondholders, and
hasn't any prospect of paying them off in full this year.
Restive bondholders and casino suppliers have filed lawsuits
and more are expected. If one bank should move to foreclose
on Mr. Trump, others could follow in rapid succession.
Bankruptcy court could provide an orderly way to keep
creditors at bay while Mr. Trump attempted to put his
financial affairs in order.

   But the bankers who have clamored to loan him money in the
past don't want any part of such a reorganization. They say
such a court-supervised reorganization would cost them a
fortune in legal fees, take years to complete, reduce their
control over Mr. Trump's assets and personal spending, and
create the risk that a bankruptcy would devalue the Trump
name and depress the market price of his properties.
   To avoid these perceived perils, the bankers have forged
an agreement that creates, in effect, an out-of-court
bankruptcy. It carries many of the same restrictions on Mr.
Trump's activities but without yielding to the mandates of a
bankruptcy judge and without conforming to any formal rules
of court.
   "This country is totally pro-debtor," said one banker who
participated in negotiations. "So it's better for us to give
him a little more money now with the chance of getting a lot
more back later."
   The prospect of a bankruptcy filing permeated all of the
discussions, serving as a tool that banks used against other
banks to secure commitments to the deal and as a weapon that
Mr. Trump occasionally brandished against his creditors. But,
despite such threats, it appears that Mr. Trump had no taste
either for a bankruptcy-court filing, which could lead him to
the brink of financial ruin as each creditor got a shot at
his business and personal holdings.
   Had Mr. Trump filed for bankruptcy-court protection he
would have benefited immediately from the law's most generous
provision: an automatic stay barring any legal maneuvering by
his creditors, including any loan foreclosures.
   Mr. Trump also would have had the exclusive right to file
a plan for reorganization during the first 120 days. That
means he, and not his creditors, could propose to the court
just how he intended to get out of his financial mess. And,
barring any evidence of fraud or serious misconduct, he could
have continued to manage his properties, albeit under the
watchful eyes of a bankruptcy judge.
   Bankruptcy is "a potent lever because it slows things
down," says Alan Kornberg, a bankruptcy partner at Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, in New York. "He remains
in control and his creditors are precluded from taking any
action against him."
   Banks, even more than other creditors, suffer in
bankruptcy court because they lose access to their most
powerful weapon -- foreclosure. "The banks come to the table
without the threat of foreclosure. They can't garnish his
bank accounts, sue, threaten to sue or demand additional
collateral," says former bankruptcy judge Dean M. Gandy, now
a partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, in Dallas.
"Their position is frozen."
   Avoiding that prospect alone was a powerful incentive for
Mr. Trump's banks to keep negotiating. Under terms of the
proposed $65 million loan agreement -- which still awaits
approval -- the banks will maintain stringent controls over
Mr. Trump's access to cash. He will have to hold down his
monthly spending and adhere to a business plan with strict
month-by-month cash-flow projections.
   Even in bankruptcy court, Mr. Trump would have had to
adhere to a business plan. But a judge -- not Mr. Trump's
creditors -- would have had final say over Mr. Trump's access
to fresh loans. And generally a debtor can get a judge's
approval for such finances if he can show the money is needed
for "good business purposes" and isn't available elsewhere on
better terms.
   Mr. Trump's creditors had other reasons to fear the
Bankruptcy Code. Some of the law's more complex provisions
can bind creditors to a reorganization plan that they don't
like and require them to accept forms of payment they would
otherwise reject.
   Under the law, creditors are separated into classes
depending on the degree to which their loans were secured.
For a final reorganization plan to win court approval, each
class of creditors must consent by vote of two-thirds,
representing two-thirds of the debt owed in each class.
Creditors who fall in the minority -- "non-consenting
creditors" -- can thus be dragged into a financial
reorganization plan that they wouldn't otherwise accept.
   Another provision in the law permits the judge to require
a creditor to accept payment of "money's worth," such as a
note from a debtor, in lieu of cash from the sale of an
asset. This provision, and the judge's authority to enforce
it, is known as a "cram down," and, to creditors, it is one
of the most loathsome aspects of the Bankruptcy Code.
   "A judge," says Mr. Gandy, in Dallas, "might assign
greater value to the future stream of payment than the
creditor would."
   In Mr. Trump's case, the threat of bankruptcy carried
added risks for his creditors. If he had defaulted on loan
payments, Mr. Trump could have had his casino licenses
revoked by the New Jersey Casino Commission. In such an
instance, a receiver could have been appointed to run the
casinos and the value of these properties probably would have
declined, leaving less money to pay off creditors.
   Indeed, any time there is a bankruptcy, the value of the
debtor's assets drops. In Mr. Trump's case, the most
important question to his creditors was whether his
properties would hold their value best inside or outside of
bankruptcy court.
   But for all the negotiating leverage and protection that
Chapter 11 offered Mr. Trump, bankruptcy carried heavy and
unattractive risks as well. In addition to being potentially
humiliating, filing for reorganization would have required
him to hand over ultimate control of his assets to a
bankruptcy judge.
   And because Mr. Trump personally guaranteed over $500
million in loans, he would not likely have been able to file
for corporate bankruptcy alone. He would have been forced to
file personally as well, no small matter for a man as
ego-driven as Mr. Trump. Such a filing would have restricted
virtually every penny Mr. Trump spends on his personal
affairs and limited his control over his empire.
   "You can't just pick up the phone and deal anymore," says
Mr. Gandy. "It's a totally different way of doing business
that would crimp the style of someone like Mr. Trump."
