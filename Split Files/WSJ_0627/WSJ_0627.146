   When Hilmar Kopper joined leading world bankers at the
International Monetary Conference in San Francisco this
month, he quipped: If Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
shows up and "passes the hat, I'm going to sneak out of the
room."
   The head of West Germany's Deutsche Bank AG was just
kidding. But his comment reflects the deep-seated reluctance
of the world's major commercial banks to finance the
reconstruction of the ravaged economies of the Soviet Union
and its former satellites.

   The banks don't mind lending money when Western
governments guarantee they won't lose anything. One such loan
is the planned five billion mark ($2.98 billion) credit to
the Soviet Union by West German banks and guaranteed by Bonn.
   But as for doing it alone, bankers say the costs of
rebuilding East Europe are too high, the political situations
too uncertain and many of the economies too badly damaged by
decades of communist-led centralized management. They say
they learned an expensive lesson in lending billions to Latin
American and other Third World countries, much of which may
never be repaid.
   Bankers sympathize with the plight of emerging democracies
in Eastern Europe and the stated desire of many of them to
adopt free-market mechanisms. But they say the new
governments are going to have to look elsewhere for the large
sums needed to finance projects and trade gaps.
   "Balance of payments financing isn't the job of commercial
banks," said Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse. "There
have to be other means to take care of that, whether it be
government or institutions like the International Monetary
Fund."
   Forty-two nations recently pledged about $12 billion to
the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which will lend to emerging market economies in Eastern
Europe. European Community leaders meeting in Dublin this
week agreed to start working on an aid package to help
revitalize the Soviet economy. Next month, major industrial
countries led by Europe will discuss a multibillion-dollar
credit for the Soviet Union. And several governments have
pledged aid such as export credits.
   But analysts conceded that these sums are minuscule
compared with the daunting tasks East European countries face
in transforming their inefficient economies, modernizing
industrial plants and alleviating enormous pollution
problems.
   "We have no successful examples of a fast leap from
controlled, centrally planned economies to successful,
self-sustaining market-oriented societies enjoying growth and
stability -- certainly not at the rate of speed that may be
necessary to satisfy the aspirations of the people of Eastern
Europe or the U.S.S.R. or China," said Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and chairman of James
D. Wolfensohn Inc., a New York investment banking boutique.
   Many analysts also worry that the pain involved in
switching to market-based economies -- soaring prices, closed
factories, rising unemployment and lower standards of living
-- will lead to frustrated populations and political
instability. Several Eastern countries also have large
foreign debt burdens.
   It will be years before free-market principles fully take
hold "and it will be a painful process as has already been
seen in Poland," said Mr. Kopper of Deutsche Bank.
   Rifts are growing within Poland's Solidarity movement
following the government's recent decision to adopt drastic
austerity measures. Debates still exist within the Hungarian
and Czechoslovakian governments over the degree and pace of
economic change.
   In Bulgaria and Romania, opposition groups protest the
legitimacy of governments that include many former
communists. And Nigel Lawson, former British Chancellor of
the Exchequer, told the bankers in San Francisco that the
Soviet Union was "a political and economic disaster zone."
   An exception to this negative prognosis is East Germany,
mainly because it has a big sugar daddy: West Germany.
   Some bankers bridle at the lax approach Western
governments have taken toward Latin American nations that
don't repay their bank debt. They argue that this only
discourages banks from making loans to borrowers in Eastern
Europe.
   "The thing we can't take is behavioral risk: the ability
of a borrower to say for his own reasons: `Hey, we don't want
to pay back,'" said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. "We find
a situation that I think is unique historically: where the
G-7, who are the custodians of the world economy, viewed a
situation where a country not wanting to pay its debts as a
perfectly OK thing." The G-7, or Group of Seven, includes the
U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Noting that "no one seems to care" that Brazil, with about
$10 billion of reserves and good exports, is in arrears to
bank lenders, Mr. Reed said: "How can we have a cross-border
debt to Poland if a {Western} politician says the next day:
`You don't have to pay it off?'"
