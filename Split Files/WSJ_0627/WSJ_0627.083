   LONDON -- Standard Chartered PLC debt was downgraded by
Ibca Ltd., a London-based bank credit-rating agency, another
sign of the tougher times affecting British banks.
   Ibca placed the fifth-largest U.K. banking group on its
rating watch list last March, after Standard Chartered posted
sharply lower pretax profit due to loan-loss provisions.
Yesterday, the rating agency said deterioration since then in
some Standard Chartered activities justified the lowering of
its so-called individual rating to C from B/C.

   The C grade on the Ibca scale, which runs from A to E, is
the level at which some downgraded banks have begun to lose
some institutional funds, according to Ibca. The agency says
the C rating indicates a bank has some problems -- usually
with its risk portfolio -- but has the resources to recover.
Ibca also cut Standard Chartered's long-term rating to
A-minus from A, and its short-term rating to A-2 from A-1.
   The bank "is in a bind," said David Andrews, an Ibca
director. The agency added: "Although management is confident
it has the personnel and systems in place to bring recovery,
{the bank} is likely to suffer more setbacks before this
happens."
   Will Manser, a Standard Chartered spokesman, said Ibca
"looked at us comprehensively and they've come to this
judgment. We hope that it is short-term and that the
underlying growth of our businesses will prove this to be the
case."
