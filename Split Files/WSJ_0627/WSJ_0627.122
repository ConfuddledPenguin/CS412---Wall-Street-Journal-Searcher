   Canada Packers Inc. shareholders approved a complex
transaction that would result in the acquisition of a 56%
stake in the company by a subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings
PLC of Britain.
   A. Roger Porretti, Canada Packers president and chief
executive officer, said the transaction was approved by 73%
of shareholders who voted. He said the proposal still
requires approval by Canadian regulatory authorities.

   Under the previously reported proposal, Canada Packers,
the largest food-processing company in Canada, would issue
29.5 million new shares to acquire Maple Leaf Mills Ltd., a
Hillsdown unit. Hillsdown, also a food-processing company,
would offer to acquire 7.2 million Canada Packers shares, or
about 20% of the existing shares, at 16.50 Canadian dollars
(US$14.02) each.
   The combined company would have annual revenue of about
C$4 billion.
