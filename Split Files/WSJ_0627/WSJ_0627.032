   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The government declared a "profound
break" with Brazil's protectionist past, announcing a plan to
lower tariffs, ease import restrictions and cut subsidies for
inefficient industries. It also hinted it might unfreeze $1.8
billion in foreign funds deposited at the central bank.
   Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said tariffs would
be reduced immediately on imported fibers, cloth and
clothing, and on machines and machine parts that don't
compete with machines manufactured in Brazil. She said import
quotas would be abolished as of Sunday.

   She also said the government would set up a procedure to
cut the highest tariffs almost two-thirds by 1994, to 40%
from 105% today, and would create a privately controlled
foreign trade bank. And she pledged government help to
improve education and technological development.
   "This represents a profound break with the past," Miss
Cardoso de Mello said on nationwide television.
   Analysts said the economic plan, if implemented, could
revitalize Brazil's long-protected economy. But they
cautioned that results could be long in coming. Some
initiatives are unlikely to be sent to Congress before next
year, and it will have the power to approve or reject them.
   The minister said, however, that several short-term
measures would be announced in detail today, including an
unspecified "change" in a regulation that last month froze
about $1.8 billion in profits that multinationals had
deposited at the central bank. Although the freeze was
supposed to last 18 months, Miss Cardoso de Mello said an
improvement in Brazil's foreign-exchange reserves has allowed
her to modify the rule.
   Many multinational executives thought that last month's
blockage made a mockery of Brazil's declarations that it
welcomed greater foreign investment and competition. Lifting
it would send a clear signal to outside investors that the
government is serious about opening the economy.
   In her announcement and in television interviews that
followed, the economy minister also said the government would
review protectionist laws that shield the nation's computer
industry from foreign competition, regulate software imports,
and set intellectual-property policies. It will also consider
ways to strengthen antitrust laws. Many of these laws have
raised the ire of the U.S. government and Congress. The
minister said the tariff reductions for clothing and fibers
would help damp inflation.
   Most Brazilian economists believe Brazil must throw off
four decades of protectionist shackles and liberalize its
economy if it is to compete with the world. But analysts and
business leaders were ambivalent about the government's plan.
   "I would like the government to free raw materials
imports, but I wouldn't be too happy about {lower tariffs on}
clothing imports," said Olga de Almeida Prado, an owner of
Tweed, a top men's clothing maker.
   Yoshiaki Nakano, an economist specializing in foreign
trade, said the 1994 tariff goal doesn't go far enough. "I
think {the maximum} should be smaller, from 15% to 20%,
because four or five years is enough time for industry to
adapt," he said. At the same time, Mr. Nakano voiced many
businessmen's fears that the exposure to lower foreign prices
could "turn Brazilian industry into scrap metal."
   Asked just how far the government plans to go in exposing
the computer industry to foreign competition, Miss Cardoso de
Mello noted that the new policy must still be discussed with
the Brazilian Congress. "Foreign capital should have more
effective participation in the new design," she said. But,
she said, "this should be consistent with the need we have to
develop our own technolgy."
   She added: "In sectors where Brazil can produce and master
technology, it will. In sectors where an association {with a
foreign partner} is better, this will be the route. And in
sectors where Brazil is unable to compete and create an
industry, and foreign capital should participate, it will be
asked to do so."
   The proposals follow visits in the past month by U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
