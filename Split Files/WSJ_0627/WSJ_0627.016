   MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev may be facing a rising tide of
public criticism at home, but some Soviets still love him --
and they are starting to make a song and dance about it.
   Yesterday evening, about 2,000 Soviets and a smattering of
bewildered tourists turned up at Moscow's Bolshoi theater to
celebrate the inauguration of the Mikhail Gorbachev
International Fan Club.

   "I met some American millionaires in El Paso recently and
they said to me: We all love your leader Gorbachev, how come
so many of you Soviets don't like him?" said Sofia Golovkina,
head of a Moscow ballet school and one of the club's
organizers. "Mikhail Sergeyevich gave us freedom; so we
thought, let's set up a supporters' club."
   Mr. Gorbachev himself apparently likes the idea of a fan
club, although he disappointed many by not turning up in
person at the Bolshoi for the rather low-key celebration.
There were no "I love Gorby" hats, stickers or buttons, and
little of the euphoria that surrounds the Soviet leader on
his trips abroad.
   Instead, some of Mrs. Golovkina's most promising young
students danced scenes from Swan Lake and other ballets for
an audience that included the head of the KGB and a few other
senior officials. Yevgeny Primakov, a Gorbachev confidant and
member of the newly created Presidential Council, opened the
evening with a short speech bringing Mr. Gorbachev's personal
message of thanks. "We are in a complex situation," Mr.
Primakov said, "we need to consolidate society to defend
perestroika and glasnost and support our leader, Mikhail
Sergeyevich."
   The club was actually formed in February, but the
organizers only decided to go public now, just as Mr.
Gorbachev's political fortunes seem at a low ebb. Opinion
polls show public discontent with Mr. Gorbachev is reaching
an all-time high.
   The fan club's organizers claim to have three million
members throughout the nation and lots of money. Still, they
only managed to fill about half the Bolshoi's seats, even
though they sent out thousands of invitations. Some of the
tourists in the audience, who bought tickets from scalpers
outside thinking they were just going to see a ballet, seemed
a little bewildered by the fuss. After listening to Mr.
Primakov's remarks, one bearded Danish tourist leafed through
his program and then turned to his neighbor with a puzzled
expression. "What's all this about?" he asked.
