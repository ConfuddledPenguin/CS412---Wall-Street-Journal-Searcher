   Your June 1 editorial about government-sponsored
enterprises raised some decent points about "GSEs" in
general, but erred significantly about the Farm Credit System
in particular.
   You claim "the Farm Credit System got into trouble after
1971, when Congress gave it permission to broaden and expand
its lending to non-farm rural homeowners and liberalized loan
requirements to farmers." First, our rural home-mortgage
program, limited by law to communities under 2,500 people,
actually performed quite well throughout that period and had
nothing whatever to do with our financial problems. Second,
the Farm Credit System was profitable throughout the 1970s
and "got into trouble" in the early 1980s for macroeconomic
reasons, particularly high interest rates and the disastrous
plunge in farmland values that devastated so much of rural
America.

   As a single-purpose lender restricted to agriculture and
the largest originator of real-estate loans to farmers, the
fate of Farm Credit was -- and is -- inextricably tied to the
health of the national farm economy.
   You also try to link the Farm Credit System to the current
S&amp;L debacle. Two big differences: With Farm Credit, there was
never any hint of fraud or deceit behind our financial
problems; and with Farm Credit, the assistance will be
repaid. Congress authorized up to $4 billion in bonds for the
system, of which less than half is likely to be needed. As
U.S. farms are recovering, so too is the Farm Credit System.
   Finally, you ignored the fact that Farm Credit already has
in place most of the key elements recommended in the Treasury
Department's GSE report: A strong and independent "safety and
soundness" regulator (the Farm Credit Administration), which
is financed by system institutions, not by taxpayers;
risk-based, permanent capital standards (similar to or
greater than those for federally chartered banks); a
system-financed insurance fund to protect against default;
and tighter management that has cut operating costs.
   The real wild card is Treasury's blithe demand for
triple-A bond ratings for GSEs, absent "agency status." The
truth is, Treasury does not know what would be necessary for
GSEs to attain a triple-A rating, and ignores completely how
this might affect the cost of funds and loss of credit to
sectors served by GSEs. For anyone who cares about
agriculture, housing and education, that issue needs to be
explored fully before rushing to judgment.
