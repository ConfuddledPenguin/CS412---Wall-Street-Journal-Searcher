   NEW YORK -- Turner Corp., a major general-construction
company, reached agreement on a three-year $32.5 million
revolving-credit facility with a group of banks led by Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co.
   This is Turner's first committed, unsecured
revolving-credit facility, and it replaces certain
"overnight," or very short-term, lines of credit the company
has had, a spokesman said. Turner will maintain some
overnight credit, he added.
