   National-Standard Co. said it completed the sale of its
South African unit, which will result in a third-quarter
charge of $2.8 million. Terms of the sale weren't disclosed.
   The unit, based in Uitenhage, was sold to Natstan
Manufacturing Ltd., a new, closely held South African company
formed by members of the management group of the subsidiary.
The Uitenhage operation makes tire bead wire and carbon steel
welding wire.

   National-Standard, a wire and metal products and machinery
manufacturer based in Niles, Mich., said the charge
represents the cumulative decline in the value of
National-Standard's investment in the South African company
because of foreign exchange rates.
   The company said the decline had been reported in its net
equity and now must be included in the statement of earnings.
The transaction has no effect on National-Standard's net
equity, company officials said. All proceeds will be used to
reduce National-Standard's level of borrowing.
