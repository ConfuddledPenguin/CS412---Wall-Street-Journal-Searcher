   LOEWEN GROUP Inc., a fast-growing funeral home chain based
in Vancouver, British Columbia, said it agreed to sell 64.5
million Canadian dollars (US$54.8 million) of common shares
to an underwriting group. Loewen said proceeds from the sale
to three Toronto securities dealers of 2.7 million common
shares, at C$23.875 each, will be used to help fund the
company's acquisition program. The dealers plan a subsequent
public offering of the shares in Canada, a spokesman said.
Closing of the transaction is expected by mid-July. Loewen,
which is North America's second-largest funeral home chain
and which last week announced plans to buy a Houston funeral
home chain, has about 11.5 million common shares outstanding.
