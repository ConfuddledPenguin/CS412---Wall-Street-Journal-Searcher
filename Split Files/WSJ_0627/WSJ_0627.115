   BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, said its international unit was
awarded a license to provide cellular telephone service in
New Zealand.
   The regional telecommunications company said the New
Zealand Ministry of Commerce also awarded cellular licenses
to two other companies, but these weren't identified.

   BellSouth said it will conduct further market research
before determining the magnitude of its initial investment.
The New Zealand cellular telephone market has 3.5 million
potential customers, according to a BellSouth estimate.
   The licenses granted to BellSouth and others follow a
decision two weeks ago by the New Zealand government to sell
its state-owned telephone company to Ameritech of Chicago,
Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia, and two New Zealand
companies for about $2.46 billion.
