   CRAWFORD &amp; Co., an Atlanta-based insurance claims
adjusting concern, said it plans to issue a dividend of one
share of newly issued Class A common stock for each of its
17.7 million common shares outstanding, and to reclassify
existing common shares as Class B stock. The Class A shares
will have substantially the same rights as Class B shares,
except that Class A stock generally won't have any voting
rights. About 70% of the common stock is controlled by James
H. Crawford, founder. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on
the stock dividend at a special meeting July 24, which also
is the date of record for entitlement to the new shares.
Effective in the third quarter, Crawford &amp; Co. intends to pay
a quarterly of 9.5 cents a share on the Class A stock and
eight cents a share on the Class B stock. It has been paying
quarterlies of 16 cents a share. The company said it expects
the Class A shares to trade "at or near parity" with the
Class B stock.
