   About this time last year, Vonn Logan was walking on
clouds. As a 30-year-old M.B.A. student at the University of
Arizona, his plan for a Hawaiian souvenir seafood business
had just been picked as one of three winners in an
entrepreneurial studies program. His uncle was so
enthusiastic that he offered to provide start-up financing,
using the cash flow of his established shrimp wholesaling
business.
   Then the troubles began.

   His uncle's shrimp supplier suddenly redirected its entire
harvest to a competitor. With that business drying up, there
was nothing for seed money. "We were a booming business on
Wednesday, and hadn't any product to sell on Thursday," Mr.
Logan recalls. "That's one thing school didn't prepare me
for: how vicious things could get."
   While entrepreneurial education was once rare, more than
250 colleges and universities now offer it in some form, says
the Association of Collegiate Entrepreneurs. Full-fledged
programs such as the one at Arizona's Karl Eller Center for
the Study of the Private Market Economy, are especially in
vogue. Students in the program develop business plans --
often for enterprises that they hope to start when they
graduate. But how do graduates of entrepreneurial programs
fare when cast adrift on the rough seas of American business?
Can academia prepare them for a shrimp supplier who decides
to sell to a rival?
   Sandra Lenick Olivier, whose business plan for D.L. West
Manufacturing Co., Los Angeles, won the Eller Center's 1986
competition, says an "attitude of perseverance" learned at
the school helped her and her colleagues turn the company
into a profitable, $400,000-a-year maker of hinged
paper-holders for home, office and car. But Ms. Olivier, a
co-owner of the company, says no school could have prepared
her for a few real-world shocks, such as the lightning-fast
changes in consumer markets. "Sometimes you just finish a
brochure and distribute it, and it's already obsolete," she
says.
   The three top prize winners among last year's 35 Eller
Center students -- Mr. Logan, William De Jong of Chicago, and
Dale Deming of Tucson -- haven't gotten as far as Ms. Olivier
yet. In fact, they haven't even managed to get started yet.
They have positioned themselves in the industries they've
targeted for their inventions or ideas, but they have
families to feed as well as dreams to fulfill.
   A look at their journeys so far points up the obstacles
that entrepreneurs -- even those with prize-winning ideas --
face in trying to get started. Still, as good entrepreneurs
must, these young men are holding on to their dreams and
moving to turn them into reality.
                                                                                                       

   WILLIAM DE JONG
                                                                                                       

   Mr. De Jong was drawn to the Eller Center because he
craved more information about how to start a business. He'd
once looked at running his own carwash, but found it
"overwhelming," he says. "I got caught up in all the
different things that had to be done to start a business, and
it died."
   After graduation from Eller he had planned to leave his
job as a welding engineer at Hughes Aircraft Co. and get his
business plan for a different sort of company, Retool Inc.,
rolling right away. His company would resharpen commonly used
industrial tools called endmills, using a computerized
technique designed to extend the life of the tools.
   But the 30-year-old Mr. De Jong, too, has had his start-up
plans sidetracked. He recently did leave Hughes, but for a
job at Ferranti Sciaky, a much smaller, welding equipment
concern in Chicago that had taken an interest in Retool Inc.
during his school days. Working there, he believes, will ease
the shock of going directly from Hughes to the tiny start-up
he envisions Retool eventually will be. "It's kind of
frightening to have all your experience with a large
corporation, and then jump into a two- or three-man company,"
he says.
   Being in the Midwest, Ferranti Sciaky also is close to
both his family and to his eventual market: smaller
manufacturers who use endmills and need a cheaper way to
maintain them.
   He could eventually decide to sell Ferranti his business
plan, which requires $550,000 for start-up. But "most
definitely," Mr. De Jong expects to start either Retool or
another company on his own someday. When that time comes, he
says, the Eller Center's concentration on "the big picture"
will help him. "Even when I deal with concept design now, I
look at how I am going to build it, how I am going to finance
it, and such things as the time-value of money for having the
machinery on my floor without any work to do."
   Today, if he wanted to start that carwash, Mr. De Jong
says, "I would know how to put the business plan together,
and have the confidence to approach people for funding."
                                                                                                       

   VONN LOGAN
                                                                                                       

   There's no question that Mr. Logan was ablaze last year
with his idea -- marketing fresh seafood to Japanese
tourists, whose "omiyage" cultural tradition requires
purchase of special gifts for family and friends. But he and
his wife were also expecting a fourth child soon after his
return to Hawaii. And raising $200,000 to start his proposed
Honolulu Flying Fish Inc. seemed dependent on the help from
his uncle, another in a long line of Logans in the island
fish business.
   As Mr. Logan helped build up the shrimp operation as part
of the agreed-upon incentive program, he worked on his own
packaging design. Packaging, he had decided during his work
at Arizona, "was in a lot of ways just as important as the
product itself." An attractive and clever box "is consistent
with the social obligation" the Japanese feel about gift
giving. Thus, he developed the concept of a fish-shaped,
plastic-foam carrier with a dry-ice compartment designed to
keep the food fresh for the flight back to Japan.
   Then, however, came the sudden shrimp-supply setback at
the company that was to be his financing "angel." Mr. Logan
had to find other work, this time handling distribution for a
shrimp aqua-culture concern. Added to that were some pressing
financial needs as his family grew. Now, though, he feels
pushing back his timetable won't hurt much. As he watches
Japanese spending trends, he says, "I'm developing a good
solid track record in specialty seafood wholesaling."
                                                                                                       

   DALE DEMING
                                                                                                       

   Eller Center administrators say last year's No. 1 student
could become first in the class to put a company in
operation. Mr. Deming wowed judges with a highly developed
proposal to market "Lectrofog," a patented device to suppress
the huge dust clouds trucks create at mine and construction
sites.
   The equipment would fit right onto the giant vehicles, and
direct positively charged water fog at the negatively charged
dust, replacing conventional water spraying. Lectrofogging,
he says, would improve visibility, while helping miners and
builders meet strict environmental dust-control standards.
And it's a system that seems especially suited to his current
employer, Magma Copper Co., for whom he is environmental
control manager.
   But Mr. Deming, too, has opted to slow his drive to
market. "I'm trying to keep it rolling in night-time hours
and on weekends," says the 35-year-old engineer and father of
two.
   He's now negotiating with Magma, he says, about a possible
joint venture and development of a prototype device. A Magma
spokesman says only that dust suppression "is a big cost, and
if there's a way to help in the dust-control area we'd be
very interested."
   But Mr. Deming feels ready to break out on his own if need
be. At school he marketed the system by calling "mining
companies all around the U.S., and they are still very
potential customers," he says. The school's emphasis on
designing complete five-year financial models for start-ups,
including cash-flow statements, helped him.
   Also, before his Arizona studies he says he was "a pretty
shy public speaker {and} wouldn't project myself very well."
But by the final competition, he adds, "I certainly had
turned that around."
