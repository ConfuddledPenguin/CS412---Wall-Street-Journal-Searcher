   Washington is agog that President Bush handed out a
statement on the budget that included the words, "tax revenue
increases." The town's Democrats and their supporters haven't
sounded so happy since 1960. Hmmm. What's that word "revenue"
doing in there? Is it possible to have a tax revenue increase
without a "tax increase"? We think so. It's called a
capital-gains tax cut. Stay tuned.
