   The villagers were happy whenever someone was saved from
the ravages of Dr. Frankenstein's monster, so anything to
limit RICO would help. Of course, when it comes to dangerous
beasts of fiction and fact, it's a good idea to relax only
when the threat is totally destroyed.
   So only some polite applause for a bill announced last
week now working its way through the House. It addresses what
is probably the biggest problem with the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law -- to wit, that it was passed
to help prosecutors bring criminal cases against mobsters,
but now is used more than 90% of the time by private parties
suing legitimate businesses and individuals in garden-variety
lawsuits for damages. Triple damages and getting to smear
someone as a "racketeer" makes RICO a favorite among
plaintiffs' lawyers.

   The reform bill would create a judicial gatekeeper to
block abusive cases between private parties. Federal judges
would have broad discretion to just say no to these civil
RICO cases, especially when there is no criminal aspect to
the case. Most civil RICO cases could go forward only if they
would help deter "the repetition of egregious criminal
conduct."
   The bill would require judges to dismiss cases unless one
of two tests is met. One is that the defendant has already
been criminally convicted under one of RICO's predicate acts,
such as murder or mail fraud. The other -- and here's where
it gets murky -- is that the "significance of the injury"
justifies a RICO case, the defendant was a major participant
and "the remedy is needed to deter future egregious criminal
conduct." Depending on how judges view this provision, it
could knock out all run-of-the-mill contract, negligence,
securities, divorce and labor cases that now masquerade as
RICO.
   Although aimed primarily at limiting civil RICO, the bill
also recognizes that vague wording applies equally to
criminal RICO. The problem was that Congress didn't simply
want to pass a law making it a crime to be a member of the
Mafia. Instead, the crime is a "pattern" of "racketeering"
involving two "predicate acts."
   One reform would limit both the civil and criminal abuses
of RICO by finally defining what pattern means. One of the
bill's backers, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), says "no longer
would two phone calls or two letters or one of each in
breaking a contract automatically amount to a RICO case." The
bill instead says RICOable acts must be "related to one
another or to a common external organizing principle," which
"pose a threat of continuing racketeering." Also, it would
count "two or more acts which are part of a single episode"
as a single act.
   If this still sounds like gibberish, it's a big
improvement. In 1985, the Supreme Court said pattern means
"continuity plus relationship." Courts used this
interpretation to limit RICO with metaphysical essays on
"mailings" vs. "episodes" vs. "schemes" and "continuity" vs.
"relationship" vs. "distinctiveness."
   The Supreme Court called off this exercise in divining
Congress's intent with its 1988 case, H. J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone. Justice Antonin Scalia noted
that judicial efforts to define pattern had "produced the
widest and most persistent circuit split on an issue of
federal law in recent memory." He said RICO "is beyond me . .
. it is also beyond the Court." Saying that pattern requires
continuity plus relationship, he said, is as helpful as
saying, "Life is a fountain." A majority of justices have now
agreed that RICO might be unconstitutionally vague.
   RICO has its apologists. Notre Dame law professor Robert
Blakey, who as a congressional staffer helped draft RICO,
recently wrote a law-review article defending the law's
vagueness. "The question is whether Congress should try to
make `pattern' more definite," Dr. Frankenst . . . er, Mr.
Blakey says. He says no, that the meaning of pattern be "left
flexible so it can be used in a variety of situations."
   One person's flexibility is another's civil rights
violation. Almost any definition of pattern would have
prevented the RICOing of Robert Wallach, Edwin Meese's old
friend. He was convicted for mailing two legal bills that
prosecutors said were actually for lobbying -- lobbying that
would have been legal. Even so, two "mail frauds" make a
"pattern" so Mr. Wallach is a racketeer.
   The proposed reform would also decriminalize some
exercises of the right to free speech. The National
Organization for Women has nearly put Operation Rescue out of
business by RICOing its members for picketing abortion
clinics. The bill would exempt nonviolent demonstrations as
racketeering acts. This would still leave open to RICO suits
several defendants whose alleged racketeering was writing or
publishing articles about anti-abortion demonstrations. The
bill would also reduce frivolous claims by requiring
plaintiffs to file pleadings with "particularity" and by
raising their burden of proof.
   The House bill has a fair chance of passage, but would
have to be reconciled with a very different Senate bill. The
Senate's is more limited, but does abolish triple damages in
most civil suits and gives special protection for the much
RICOed securities and commodities industries.
   Meanwhile, as Congress fiddles, comedian and perennial
presidential candidate Pat Paulsen is the latest husband to
be sued as a racketeer by an estranged wife (maybe he'll form
the Dump RICO Party?). We now know that even pets can raise
class-action RICO claims; Ralston Purina has been sued as a
racketeering enterprise for allegedly exaggerating the
virtues of Puppy Chow.
   The proposed RICO reform is hardly perfect. It probably
would not have stopped the coercive RICOing of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, Michael Milken or Princeton/Newport. It wouldn't
prevent pretrial forfeitures of assets. Commodities traders
could still innocently become racketeers. It has no answer
for the federal judge in the RICO case against Imelda Marcos,
who last week asked, "What's an American court, what am I
doing here, trying a case involving the theft of money from
Philippine banks?"
   This reform bill is better than no bill. Still, some day
either Congress or the Supreme Court must conclude that the
only really good RICO is a repealed RICO.
