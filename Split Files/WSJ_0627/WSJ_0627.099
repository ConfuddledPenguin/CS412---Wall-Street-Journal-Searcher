   CHICAGO -- Continental Bank Corp. said it will post a
second quarter loss, mostly due to a $50 million pretax
charge to cover the costs of cutting 900 jobs and retreating
from some businesses.
   The move reflects relatively weak demand for loans and
other services at nearly all big commercial banks, and also
is a setback for Continental's efforts to fully recover from
its 1984 collapse and federal bailout. Over the past three
years, Continental has shunned consumer banking and instead
pursued an all-business-banking plan, but has found those
markets are fiercely competitive and, in places, not very
profitable.

   Continental stock fell 62.5 cents on the news to close at
$15.375.
   About 60% of the job cuts will come in the so-called
trading and distribution business, an area Continental began
building aggressively about two years ago by hiring officers
away from competitors at top dollar. Some of that hiring,
Thomas C. Theobald, Continental's chairman and chief
executive officer, conceded, "was a wrong use of resources."
   Continental has done particularly poorly in trading for
its own account in foreign exchange and other markets and in
clearing and executing trades in financial contracts such as
futures and options for customers, Mr. Theobald said. The
hiring in trading and distribution has worked out well, on
the other hand, in selling so-called interest-rate risk
management services, and in selling customers' loans and
other debt to other investors, he said.
   Mr. Theobald said the second quarter loss would also
include the cost of selling some municipal and Treasury bonds
now worth less than the banking concern paid for them. He
wouldn't disclose the amount of the expected loss for the
quarter, or the loss taken during the quarter by selling
bonds. At March 31, Continental's investment portfolio of
about $2.3 billion was valued at $69 million less than its
cost.
   In last year's second quarter, Continental profit was
$64.1 million, or $1.01 a share, and included a $7 million
gain from the sale of real estate.
   Even without the charge and the bond losses, the second
quarter wouldn't have been a good one, Mr. Theobald said,
though he wouldn't disclose expected operating profit. "We're
making money," he said, "but not at a satisfactory rate."
   The staff cuts will save $25 million during the second
half of 1990, Continental said, and about $75 million a year
in future years. If revenue holds up at current levels, Mr.
Theobald said the cost cuts should be enough to get the
company to its profit goals, including 15% return on equity.
   The staff cuts, from a March 31 level of 6,720, will also
include some so-called back office workers, some lending
officials and others.
