   FREEHOLD, N.J. -- Raycomm Transworld Industries Inc.
expects to report break-even results for the fourth quarter
ended March 31 and a $730,000 profit for the year, compared
with net losses in both year-earlier periods.
   The fiscal fourth quarter is usually the weakest for
Raycomm, when the temporary-help concern pays higher payroll
taxes; the levies are higher early in the calendar year and
decline as the year goes on, said Robert Fain, president and
chief executive officer, in an interview.

   But by slashing overhead, reducing corporate staff and
focusing on a core business -- placing technical personnel in
the aerospace, defense and electronics industries -- the
company was able to bring its net worth to about a positive
$766,000 at fiscal year's end from a negative $1.3 million a
year earlier, Mr. Fain said in an interview.
   The fourth-quarter estimate compares with a year-ago loss
of $575,000, or six cents a share. Raycomm's quarterly
revenue is estimated at $12.5 million to $13 million vs.
$12.8 million, Mr. Fain said.
   For the year, Raycomm's profit estimate equals eight cents
a share, compared with a loss of $2.7 million, or 30 cents a
share, for fiscal 1989. The company estimates that revenue
slipped about 4.4% to $53.5 million from $55.9 million; the
company disposed of two businesses, temporary-help
franchising and nursing placement, during fiscal 1989.
   "We're enjoying a very good {fiscal} first quarter," Mr.
Fain said, and the company projects substantially stronger
results for both the quarter and all of fiscal 1991.
   "The most important thing that could get in the way," he
said, would be a radical cut in defense {spending}, and we
weren't able to replace the business. I don't foresee it, but
it could happen."
