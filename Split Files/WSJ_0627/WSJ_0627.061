   Europeans have already taken over most of the oldest and
grandest names on Madison Avenue. J. Walter Thompson. Ted
Bates. Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
   That acquisition frenzy has cooled considerably, what with
a skittish economy and lessons learned from Britain's
overextended, acquisition-minded Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. But
industry executives say the Europeans appear poised to invade
another sector of their business: media buying.

   In Europe, media buying companies -- firms that do nothing
but buy commercial ad time and space on behalf of clients --
are common, buying as much as 40% and sometimes more of all
media in a given country. In the U.S., ad agencies still rule
that business, shepherding nearly all of the tens of billions
of dollars spent by clients annually on television time and
magazine and newspaper space. A number of media buying
companies have sprung up here since the 1980s, but most are
tiny, and none have yet met up to early expectations of
explosive growth.
   The Europeans, though, may change that soon. European
media and advertising firms have approached almost every U.S.
media buying firm of note on these shores. U.S. executives
say the Europeans speak of ultimately building sprawling
media-buying empires in the U.S., much the way they have
already in Europe.
   "They're all dancing around trying to enter the U.S.
market," says Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, who has reason to
know: His firm has been approached by several European firms,
even though it handles billings of just $100 million in a
$100 billion marketplace. "The Europeans look at the U.S. and
see 50% of the world's advertising billings here, so there's
no question that companies over there are lusting to get into
this market."
   Executives of perhaps the largest European media buyer,
London-based Aegis Group, were in town this week to meet with
investors and explain what media buying is all about. In an
interview, Roger Parry, the group's development director,
said that U.S. expansion "isn't first priority," and that
expanding in Europe and entering Scandinavia and the
Netherlands are more important. But he added, "We will always
consider America. We certainly wouldn't rule it out."
   Mr. Parry stressed that Aegis, whose Carat media buying
company handles $3.4 billion in billings across Europe, isn't
"actively seeking" any U.S. acquisition. But several media
buying firms in the U.S. said they had been contacted at one
time or another by Aegis, among others. Aegis, because of its
size -- it already buys more than 7% of all media across
Europe, and is gunning for 15% -- is expected to be among the
first to make inroads in the U.S.
   Among those with whom Aegis has held conversations is the
largest U.S. media buying service, Western Media
International in Los Angeles. Western's chief executive
officer, Dennis Holt, says the company handled billings of
$720 million last year for clients including Walt Disney. The
company has also been approached by other Europeans,
including London's WPP Group PLC, which owns Thompson and
Ogilvy.
   According to Mr. Holt, Western Media and Aegis have had
casual discussions over the past year and a half, and might
enter into a joint venture in Europe. But he says he doesn't
foresee selling out his own company in the near future,
because "we're successful on our own."
   Mr. Holt does, though, see enormous potential for European
companies interested in acquiring U.S. media buying
companies. By the year 2000, he predicts, 10% to 20% of all
U.S. media will be bought by media buying companies.
   And he says that with the increasing internationalization
of media -- at a time when behemoths like Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. own TV stations, newspapers and satellite systems
across continents -- international media buying is sure to
follow; he envisions a day when Procter &amp; Gamble can buy ad
time across the U.S., Europe and the Eastern bloc at once.
   Major U.S. ad agencies scoff at that kind of talk. A
number of them are involved in media-buying consortiums
abroad, but say there's no place for that kind of business
here. At New York-based Omnicom Group, which had once looked
briefly at media buying services, "I can assure you we aren't
contemplating any such acquisition. I don't think it makes a
lot of sense in the U.S.," says Bruce Crawford, chairman.
   U.S. agencies reel off a laundry list of reasons why media
buying services -- homegrown and European imports -- will
never make the big time here. The media buying services claim
they can get big discounts by buying bulk. But agency
executives insist the services will never have the clout of
heavyweight agencies like Young &amp; Rubicam or Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising, each with U.S. billings in excess of $2
billion.
   European media buying is different from U.S. media buying,
too, in ways that might be difficult to translate. The
European services tend to concentrate on print, for example,
while in the U.S. the emphasis is on television. And most
U.S. media buying services are private, making their true
value difficult for potential buyers to determine.
   But Aegis's Mr. Parry says the U.S. may be ripe for more
media buying services because, as the traditional TV networks
lose viewers to alternatives like cable and videocassettes,
media buying is becoming that much more complicated. "And the
more fragmented the {the media marketplace}, the stronger the
argument is for specialized buying," he says.
   Hal Katz of Katz Marketing &amp; Media, a media consulting
firm, also sees untapped opportunities for the Europeans:
"They have the mass and they have the multinational client
base to make inroads into the U.S. They may well be able to
do it."

   AD TAX UPDATE: Pennsylvania is the latest state that may
consider introducing an ad tax. Rep. Robert Reber, a
Republican from southeast Pennsylvania, has drafted a bill
calling for a 6% tax on local advertising that would be used
to fund mass transit. However, the proposal hasn't yet been
introduced, and in an interview, Mr. Reber said he drafted it
mainly to gauge reaction from other House members. "It's not
like it's ready to fly," he said. Similar ad tax proposals in
Rhode Island, New York and Kentucky were all defeated earlier
this year, according to the American Advertising Federation.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Hiram Walker Inc. chose the Chicago office
of Eisaman, Johns &amp; Laws to create U.S. advertising for
Beefeater Gin. The account, with billings of about $8
million, had been handled by MacNamara, Clapp &amp; Klein. Hiram
Walker took over U.S. marketing of Beefeater when it acquired
Buckingham Wile, Beefeater's American distributor, earlier
this year. Meanwhile, MacNamara Clapp said it picked up two
new accounts, for Angels Flight menswear and Ark Restaurants
in New York, which it expects will bill $2.5 million and $1
million-to-$2 million, respectively.
