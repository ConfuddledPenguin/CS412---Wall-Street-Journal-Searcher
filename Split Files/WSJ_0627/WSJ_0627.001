   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. named Robert
Puette, longtime leader of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s personal
computer business, as president of its Apple USA division,
effective July 1.
   Mr. Puette, 48 years old, succeeds Allan Z. Loren, who was
forced to resign in a major management shake-up in January.
Mr. Puette will report to Michael Spindler, Apple's former
European sales whiz who was named chief operating officer.
Mr. Spindler has functioned as Apple USA president on an
acting basis in the interim.

   Mr. Puette takes the reins of an organization which had
become strained by a slowdown in sales, and soured by Mr.
Loren's reported unpopularity with his own staff and computer
dealers.
   In the fiscal year 1989, Apple's U.S. sales grew 20%, half
the rate of its European sales. Moreover, Apple began 1990
with a forecast of little or no domestic growth.
   Mr. Puette's responsibilities will encompass sales,
marketing and support; he will oversee both education and
business markets; and he will manage relations with Apple's
own field sales personnel, as well as third party computer
dealers.
   Analysts weren't surprised that Apple chose to tap outside
talent to fill the post. In Mr. Puette's 24-year career at
Hewlett-Packard, where he most recently held the title of
general manager, Personal Computer Group, he is credited with
the start-up, development and expansion of its global PC
business.
   Mr. Spindler said Mr. Puette brings "the right set of
skills and experience to galvanize Apple's U.S. business in
the coming years."
   Specifically, Mr. Spindler said, those strengths include
his combination of technical expertise and his ability to
manage a large and complex business organization.
