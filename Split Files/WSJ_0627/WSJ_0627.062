   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp. expects to
cut a requested rate increase and boost debt repayment
through a sharp reduction in capital outlays and operating
expenditures at its Arizona Public Service unit, Richard
Snell, chairman, president and chief executive, said.
   Included in the utility holding company's cost-squeezing
plan is a revised rate application with Arizona regulators
that will be markedly lower than a current request for a 6.8%
rate hike in each of the next three years, Mr. Snell said.

   The current rate request, filed in January, has become a
target of sniping between Pinnacle West and PacifiCorp.
PacifiCorp, Portland, Ore., has made an unsolicited $1.82
billion takeover offer for Pinnacle West, earning local
political support with a promise to raise rates by 2%
annually over the three-year period.
   Pinnacle West has rebuffed PacifiCorp's overtures, saying
that it wants to remain independent. PacifiCorp officials
have hinted strongly that they may pursue Pinnacle West on a
hostile basis.
   Pinnacle West's Mr. Snell, in an interview, reiterated the
company's plan to remain independent, outlining in broad
terms efforts to extract itself from nearly-disastrous
divisification moves and to pay down debt. He said there had
been no contacts of late between representatives of the two
companies.
   Mr. Snell declined to disclose the rates Arizona Public
Service will seek in its revised application but made it
clear that the utility won't be matching PacifiCorp's
promised 2% annually.
   A key component of its cost-reduction plan will be a
reduction of about $500 million from previously planned
capital outlays. Among other things, Arizona Public Service,
with one of the fastest growth rates in the country, has
slowed of late, adding a projected 11,000 new customers this
year compared to annual averages of about 30,000 a few years
ago.
   Last year, the utility spent about $270 million on capital
outlays, down from an earlier-budgeted $300 million. Spending
this year will total about $254 million, and annual outlays
for 1991 to 1993 will be about $200 million under the revised
plan.
   On the operating side, Mr. Snell suggested that there will
be reductions but declined to disclose details. He said that
"going forward there will be job reductions, not necessarily
layoffs." The utility, which already has reduced its work
force to 7,700 from a peak of 9,100, said earlier this month
that its job reductions would exceed the 150 already slated
for this year.
   Over the next few years, Mr. Snell said Arizona Public
Service's parent, Pinnacle West, will pay down much of its
debt; repayment of more than $600 million is projected. At
March 31, Pinnacle West had $1.13 of its own long-term debt.
The consolidated total was $3.53 billion, including debt of
the utility unit.
   Pinnacle West expects to repay about $200 million of its
debt this year, among other things, through cash flow from
the $211 million in dividends annually from Arizona Public
Service and the proceeds of asset sales. The company has paid
$95 million of the projected total to date.
