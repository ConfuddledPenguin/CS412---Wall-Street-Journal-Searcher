   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund next week
will increase its interest charges on more than $30 billion
in loans outstanding to 9.65% a year from a current 8.85%,
according to IMF officials.
   This action, they explained, will be required under a
"burden-sharing" agreement approved by the IMF's
policy-making interim committee in May.

<TEXT>
   Through higher charges on its regular loans and a
reduction of interest payments to the U.S. and other creditor
nations, the IMF intends to build up a special $1.2 billion
"pool" over several years. The "pool" would support efforts
of borrowing nations with overdue IMF loans to repay these
credits and regain eligibility for IMF financial assistance.
   The higher charges won't apply to certain IMF loans, such
as its credits to poorer Third-World countries, primarily
sub-Saharan African nations.
