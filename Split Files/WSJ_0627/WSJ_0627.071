   NEW YORK -- A new possible suitor for Ultimate Corp.
emerged as FNIC disclosed that it holds 8.4% of the
computer-systems concern and is considering an acquisition.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, FNIC said that its decision hinges on further
study of Ultimate, taking into consideration a poison-pill
anti-takeover measure Ultimate adopted in April.

   FNIC's decision also would take into account factors such
as the availability of financing and the "attitude and
action" of Ultimate's board, the filing said.
   Based in Midvale, Utah, FNIC has operations, investments
and joint ventures in management information services, data
processing, software development, and related technology
companies.
   Ultimate Chairman Michael O'Donnell said there has been no
discussion between the two companies, and Ultimate "hasn't
been contacted" by FNIC.
   FNIC purchased 749,578 Ultimate shares from May 22 to June
4 for $6.50 apiece, all in private transactions. The company
paid for them with notes bearing a 9% interest rate and a
Sept. 30 due date. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Ultimate's shares rose 50 cents to $7.625.
   Other investors who have indicated interest in acquiring
Ultimate are Norman Elowitz, who runs Honey Fashions, a
women's apparel concern in Manhattan; and Theodore Sabarese,
founder and former chairman of East Hanover, N.J.-based
Ultimate.
   Mr. Elowitz, who was unavailable for comment, recently
raised his holding in Ultimate to 8.42% and reiterated his
desire to acquire the company. In February, Ultimate rebuffed
a $10-a-share, or $95 million, takeover proposal from Mr.
Elowitz.
   Late last month, Mr. Sabarese told the SEC that he didn't
think he'd be able to garner financing for a purchase of
Ultimate. After settling a claim in a personal filing he made
under bankruptcy laws, Mr. Sabarese said he held less than 1%
of Ultimate's shares. Mr. Sabarese couldn't be reached for
comment.
   For the year ended April 30, Ultimate reported net income
of $125,000, or one cent a share, compared with a net loss of
$13 million, or $1.32 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 4.9% to $209.7 million.
