   HOUSTON -- Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a
waste-management concern, said it agreed to sell the used
aluminum cans it collects to a unit of Aluminum Co. of
America that recycles cans.
   Browning-Ferris said the pact is the first time that
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa has arranged to be supplied by a
waste-collection firm, and the first time that
Browning-Ferris has agreed to supply an aluminum company.

   A Browning-Ferris spokesman wouldn't describe the revenue
that the company might generate by selling its cans to Alcoa.
   Last year in the U.S., Browning-Ferris collected about one
billion used aluminum beverage cans.
