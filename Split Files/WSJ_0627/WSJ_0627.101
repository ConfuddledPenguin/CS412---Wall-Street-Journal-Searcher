   Nevada Power Co., Las Vegas, said a 15-day strike by
members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers was settled with the union bargaining unit's approval
of a new four-year contract.
   About 900 clerical, field and plant workers who walked out
June 7 may return to their jobs as early as Sunday morning,
the utility said. The new contract includes a pay rise of
3.5% for 1990, which is retroactive to February for plant
workers and to May for clerical workers, and increases of
3.6% in 1991, of 3.75% in 1992 and 4% in 1993. The contract
dispute focused on salary, overtime and medical benefits.

   The strike caused a backlog of new service orders, but the
utility provided service to its 328,000 existing customers by
using supervisors and other employees. Union officials
weren't immediately available for comment.
