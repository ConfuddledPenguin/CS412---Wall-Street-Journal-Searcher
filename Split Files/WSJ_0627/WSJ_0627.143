   "We saw huge buyers on the opening" among larger,
institutional investors, said Nicholas Karos, senior OTC
trader at Piper Jaffray Hopwood in Minneapolis, but they
became scarcer as the day progressed.
   "They couldn't seem to hold the rally," said Robert
Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
Mr. Antolini said the tone among OTC stocks was "generally
weak," adding that he saw a number of institutions willing to
sell stock.
   Cellular stocks were weak in the wake of Motorola's
announcement that it plans to introduce a universal cellular
phone system that could undercut their exclusive territories,
Mr. Antolini noted. Among cellular issues, McCaw Cellular
Class A shares fell 1/2 to 25 3/4 on nearly 1.3 million
shares; Contel Cellular Class A shares dropped 1/4 to 18 3/4,
and Vanguard Cellular eased 1/2 to 25.
   International Lease Finance surged 3 7/8 to 31 and was the
most-active stock with nearly 5.9 million shares changing
hands. The Beverly Hills, Calif., remarketer of jetliners
agreed to be acquired by American International Group of New
York in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at about $1.3
billion.
   Two new issues also were well received and among the day's
most-active stocks. Shares of Arctco Inc., a snowmobile maker
based in Thief River Falls, Minn., rose 5/8 to 11 5/8 after
an initial public offering yesterday of 3.2 million shares
priced at $11 each.
   AICorp rose 1 3/8 to 10 7/8. The Waltham, Mass., developer
of computer-aided software engineering products offered 2.25
million shares in an initial public offering priced at $9.50
apiece.
   Adobe Systems slid 1 3/4 to 35 and was among the day's
most active stocks. The Mountain View, Calif., software maker
reported that net income for the second quarter ended June 1
edged up to 36 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier.
   Other technology shares were mixed. Apple Computer eased
5/8 to 49 5/8; Intel was unchanged at 45 1/2, and Oracle
Systems dropped 3/4 to 21 5/8. Microsoft rose 1/4 to 74 3/4.
   MCI Communications added 1/2 to 40 1/8. The Washington,
D.C., long-distance carrier said it signed a loan agreement
for up to $1 billion with a group of 22 banks to finance its
$1.25-billion acquisition of Atlanta-based Telecom USA, the
nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier. Separately,
Citibank said it will provide its 14.6 million Visa
cardholders with a long-distance telephone service offered
through MCI.
   SciMed Life Systems jumped 2 1/8 to 35 1/8 after the
Minneapolis maker of cardiovascular medical products reported
late Monday that net income for the first quarter ended May
31 rose to 45 cents a share from 20 cents a year earlier.
   "They produced more earnings in this quarter than they did
in all of 1989," when SciMed earned 33 cents a share,
Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Kurt Kruger said in an interview.
SciMed's strong performance prompted him to repeat a "strong
buy" opinion on the stock and raise his earnings estimate for
fiscal 1991 ending in February to $2 a share, compared with
profit $1.29 a share in fiscal 1990.
   SciMed now has a firm hold as the second-largest producer
of angioplasty catheters used in heart surgery, Mr. Kruger
noted, with C.R. Bard falling to a distant third after that
company withdrew several products from the market. "I think
SciMed will, in the next decade, become a major-league
cardiovascular products company," the analyst said.
   Fortune Financial jumped 1 3/4 to 13. A group that
includes the Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp. and currently holds a
9.97% position in the Clearwater, Fla., thrift said the U.S.
Office of Thrift Supervision gave it clearance to buy up to
20% of Fortune Financial's common shares.
   Fiserv leaped 2 1/8 to 29 7/8 after American Banker, a
banking trade newspaper, reported that Electronic Data
Systems is considering buying the West Allis, Wis., data
processor for thrifts. Last week, Fiserv announced it had
preliminary talks with an unidentified company about a
possible business combination.
   Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny
the report, according to Dow Jones Professional Report.
Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co. analyst Jordan Cox told DJPIR that
Electronic Data is the only possible acquirer that owns a
similar service as Fiserv's.
   Martin Lawrence Ltd. Editions plunged 2 1/8 to 4 1/2 after
the Van Nuys, Calif., artworks publisher said it expects to
report second-quarter net income of six to 10 cents a share,
down sharply from 24 cents a year earlier. The company said
sales for the second quarter will be down about 12% to 17%
from a year earlier, citing a slowdown in the art market and
a continuing decline in overall consumer retail spending.
   Cenvest tumbled 1 1/4 to 4 3/4. The Meriden, Conn., bank
said it expects to report a second-quarter loss and will
suspend its 12-cents a share dividend for the second-quarter
after taking a special provision of about $13.2 million in
June for loan-loss reserves. Citing continued weakness in the
Connecticut real estate market, Cenvest said it is
recognizing loan losses of $4.5 million from its current
reserves.
   Aequitron Medical slid 3/15 to 2 1/8 after the Minneapolis
medical-device company said it is recalling thousands of
machines used primarily to monitor infants' respiration and
heart rates to repair faulty alarm systems.
