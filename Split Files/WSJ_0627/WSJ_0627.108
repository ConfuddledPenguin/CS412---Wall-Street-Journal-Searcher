   NEW YORK -- Avon Products Inc. ended negotiations with
John P. Rochon, a member of Avon's largest shareholder group
whom Avon previously agreed to hire as a consultant to
explore ways of boosting its stock price.
   The talks broke down over the proposed terms of Mr.
Rochon's consulting contract, including Avon's insistence
that Mr. Rochon report to Avon Chairman James Preston rather
than to a special committee of Avon's board, a spokesman for
Mr. Rochon said. Avon and Mr. Rochon hadn't even begun
discussing how much Mr. Rochon would be paid because Avon
insisted that other terms of the contract be resolved first.

   An Avon spokesman contended that the main issue for Avon
was its demand that Mr. Rochon sever all of his ties to Mary
Kay Corp., a cosmetics company of which Mr. Rochon is vice
chairman. "Avon's management and board concluded that it is
not appropriate to share confidential and proprietary
financial and operating information with an employee of a
competitor," the Avon spokesman said.
   The breakdown in talks between Avon and Mr. Rochon makes
it less likely that Avon will be sold or restructured anytime
soon, several takeover-stock traders said. Avon's tough
negotiating stance with Mr. Rochon also indicates that
because of the tight market for takeover financing, Avon
isn't particularly worried that its dissident shareholders
will mount a hostile bid, traders and investment bankers
said.
   Avon closed at $35.125, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   In March, Avon had agreed to hire Mr. Rochon as part of a
settlement of a proxy fight mounted by Chartwell Associates,
an investment group that owns a 16.6% stake in Avon.
Investors in Chartwell include the Fisher real estate family
of New York, oil heir Gordon P. Getty, Mary Kay Corp., and
Mr. Rochon. As part of the settlement, Avon agreed to
nominate two Chartwell representatives to its board and to
name a special board committee to explore ways of increasing
shareholder value.
   Richard L. Fisher, a managing partner of Chartwell, said
Chartwell is "very disappointed in Avon's actions. We believe
that if the special committee is to fulfill its mandate, the
committee must have as its consultant an independent expert
who is not affiliated with Avon." Mr. Fisher said Chartwell
"will continue to pursue vigorously our objective of
maximizing shareholder value."
   In addition to Chartwell, major investors in Avon include
a partnership of Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway
Corp., which owns a 9.8% stake, and the Robert M. Bass Group
of Fort Worth, Texas, which owns a 6.2% stake.
   Avon had proposed that Mr. Rochon sign a one-year
consulting contract and that he agree not to serve in any
capacity with Mary Kay or any firm that competes with Avon
during that time. In addition, the proposed contract would
have barred Mr. Rochon from working for a competitor of Avon
for 10 years if Avon terminated the consulting contract for
reasons such as a breach of its terms, misconduct, or neglect
of duties.
