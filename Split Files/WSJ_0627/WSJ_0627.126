   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it signed a letter of
intent with Czechoslovakia to study a joint venture to
produce 250,000 auto transmissions a year.
   While only a preliminary step toward a possible agreement,
the announcement comes amid a flurry of Eastern European
proposals that GM has made since governments there began
giving way to freer markets a year ago.

   A GM spokesman said the company and the government should
complete the current study within the next "few months" and
decide whether to go ahead with a project. Actual production
of transmissions would begin two years after the completion
of the study.
   GM currently is in talks with two Czech companies
concerning the possibility of joint vehicle production. The
transmission negotiations are separate from those
discussions, the company said. A GM spokesman said that
before reaching an agreement to build transmissions in
Czechoslovakia the company and the government must iron out
currency and infrastructure problems, as well as reach
agreement on government regulations.
   "We've done a lot of work, and this will be the final
stages," a GM spokesman said.
   GM's goal is to boost its European vehicle production by
25% to two million vehicles over the next five years, partly
by using Eastern Europe as a source. Czech-built
transmissions could be an important contributor to that plan,
a spokesman said.
   GM also said it plans to have dealer and distribution
networks in six Eastern European countries by the end of the
year. The company previously announced production ventures
with local companies in Hungary and East Germany.
