   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- First of America Bank Corp. expects to
report net income of $31.3 million to $32.3 million, or $1.50
to $1.55 a fully diluted share, for the second quarter,
Chairman Daniel R. Smith said.
   The regional bank holding company earned $32.3 million, or
$1.54 a fully diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.

   Mr. Smith said the company foresees good earnings growth
for the rest of the year, reflecting a seasonal rise in loan
and deposit demand. Still, Mr. Smith said he doesn't expect
loans and deposits to increase beyond earlier 6% growth
projections for the year. As a result, First of America
officials said they expect net for 1990 to fall within the
low end of analysts' estimates of $6.65 to $6.95 a share.
   First of America's return on assets for the first six
months is expected to be 1.02% to 1.04%, compared with 1% for
all of 1989. Return on common equity will likely decline to
14.9% to 15.42% for the second quarter from 15.46% a year
earlier.
   The bank has no foreign loans left on its books and hasn't
participated in buy-out financing. As of Saturday, First of
America expects to have reserves equaling 139% of
non-performing loans, up from 135% a year earlier.
   On May 4, First of America completed the repurchase of one
million shares of common stock, or 5.7% of its shares
outstanding. That action had the effect of raising
second-quarter 1990 earnings by two cents a share.
   In light of the expected pickup in business in the final
six months, and because major loan write-downs are unlikely,
a dividend increase in the second half "will be given strong
consideration," said Thomas W. Lambert, First of America's
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
   First of America has raised its dividend by five cents a
share in the latter half of each of the past four years. The
company currently pays a 55-cent-a-share regular quarterly
dividend.
