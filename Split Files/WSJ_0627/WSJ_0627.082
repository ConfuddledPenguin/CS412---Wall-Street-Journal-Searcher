   Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the National
Guard in 1957 to prevent black children from attending
all-white Central High School. In 1963, George Wallace stood
in the schoolhouse door to block two black students from
enrolling in the school of their choice. Now, in 1990,
Herbert Grover, Wisconsin's Superintendent of Public
Instruction, is openly trying to block a law that will allow
1,000 low-income black children in Milwaukee to use vouchers
to attend a private school of their choice.
   State Rep. Polly Williams, the law's author, says Mr.
Grover "is condemning inner-city kids to a mediocre education
and a bleak future." She says: "He would rather support an
outdated, entrenched system of privilege than let the
sunshine of competition in."

   Mr. Grover has publicly encouraged a teachers' union
lawsuit to enjoin him from implementing the Williams plan.
And though the law defines his role in certifying eligible
schools as minimal, he insists that participating schools
comply with a blizzard of rules and forms never specified in
the law. Among them are that each school have facilities to
handle every type of learning disability, a requirement that
each individual Milwaukee public school need not meet.
   Only two private schools filled out all the forms. Six
others didn't and Herbert Grover is set to declare them
ineligible next Monday. A judge has granted the Landmark
Center for Civil Rights, the lawyers for Polly Williams, a
hearing tomorrow on its request for an injunction to force
Mr. Grover to certify the schools if they meet all legal
requirements, but not his bureaucratic "diktats".
   Mrs. Williams came by her pro-choice educational views
after years of trying to reform Milwaukee's crumbling public
schools. A single parent and former welfare recipient, she
watched her four children graduate from public schools while
the system's budgets rose and the quality of education
plummeted.
   Starting in September, the plan will allow up to 1,000
children from families with incomes of no more than 175% of
the poverty level to attend private, nonsectarian schools.
For every child involved, the state will pay up to $2,500 in
tuition and subtract that money from its support of Milwaukee
public schools.
   "It really puzzles me that Mr. Grover would try to stop
this plan," says Thais M. Jackson, a Milwaukee single parent.
"He should be concerned about the city's children and if he
was he would not be doing this. It really doesn't make
sense."
   But Brookings Institution scholar John Chubb says the
teaching establishment's opposition makes perfect sense. "If
the Milwaukee plan delivers better results for less than half
the cost of the public schools, it brings the idea of choice
in education front and center," he says. The Williams plan is
a tactical end-run around the public education monopoly's
Maginot Line.
   William Carr, the acting administrator of the private
Urban Day School and a former public-school board member,
says the rules mandated by Mr. Grover would "turn schools
like Urban Day into public schools and defeat the very
purpose of the law." Tuition at Urban Day is $3,300 a year,
but donations allow poor parents to pay only $650 if they
also do volunteer work with the children.
   Urban Day and the other schools that want to accept
voucher students say the parental involvement and discipline
they require is a key ingredient in their success. "We have
to deliver results or the parents will take their kids
somewhere else next year," says Mr. Carr.
   Polly Williams crafted her school choice plan and pushed
it through the Wisconsin legislature with the support of
conservative Governor Tommy Thompson. "White liberals didn't
support us," recalls Mrs. Williams, who was twice the chair
of Jesse Jackson's Wisconsin campaigns. "They care more for
the education lobby than the welfare of Milwaukee children."
   "The public schools are basically just losing interest,"
says Lonzetta Davis, a single parent who wants to send her
six-year-old daughter, Sabrina, to Urban Day. "I refuse to
put up with it. I know a specific place where Sabrina can get
the education she deserves."
   The question is how long Wisconsin Superintendant of
Public Instruction Grover and his reactionary allies will
stand in the schoolhouse door and block Sabrina's way.
