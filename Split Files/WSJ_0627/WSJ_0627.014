   WASHINGTON -- Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela asked a
joint session of Congress to support financially the African
National Congress effort to bring democracy to South Africa.
   "Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues
to bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy," he said in a
35-minute speech that was interrupted by applause 18 times.

   In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mandela, ANC deputy
president, thanked Congress for the sanctions legislation
"which made such a decisive contribution to the process of
moving our country forward towards negotiations."
   He said it was encouraging to know that Congress and the
Bush administration agree "that sanctions should remain in
place. The purpose for which they were imposed has not yet
been achieved."
   Under U.S. law, the economic sanctions that were imposed
in 1986 will remain in place until certain conditions are
met, including a full lifting of the South African state of
emergency and the release of political prisoners.
   But Mr. Mandela urged the lawmakers to "go further and
assist us with the material resources which will enable us to
promote the peace process and meet other needs which arise
from the changing situation you have helped bring about."
   Mr. Mandela did not ask Congress for a specific amount of
money. Congress already has approved a total of $42 million
to assist efforts to develop democracy in South Africa.
   After the speech, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia said Mr. Mandela's refusal to renounce violence along
with earlier comments supportive of Cuba, Libya and the
Palestine Liberation Organization "dooms any plausible
chance" of U.S. aid to the ANC. The South African activist
has said leaders of Cuba and Libya and the PLO backed the
ANC's anti-apartheid struggle when the U.S. wouldn't.
   Mr. Gingrich called yesterday's speech more "balanced"
than Mr. Mandela's earlier statements.
   Democratic Whip William Gray of Pennsylvania said Mr.
Mandela's earlier comments wouldn't hurt efforts to provide
funds to the ANC. "Most members of Congress, except the
radical right, will recognize this is a fight against
apartheid, a fight against racism," he said.
   Mr. Mandela asked President Bush Monday for financial
assistance but was told the U.S. would not contribute
directly to a political party, according to a state
department official. The ANC could receive U.S. funds, if it
renounces violence in the course of negotiations, through the
National Endowment for Democracy, a privately administered
but publicly funded organization that promotes democracy
around the world.
   Included in the House chamber were members of President
Bush's cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the diplomatic
community. They joined with Mr. Mandela's supporters in
giving him a standing ovation when he said: "Peace will not
come to our country and region until the apartheid system is
ended."
   Invoking the names of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
and Abraham Lincoln, as well as figures in the fight for
black rights in the U.S., Mr. Mandela attempted to assure the
lawmakers that they would be comfortable with a South Africa
led by the ANC.
   He said that the ANC is struggling "to ensure that the
rights of every individual are guaranteed and protected
through a democratic constitution, the rule of law, an
entrenched bill of rights, which should be enforced by an
independent judiciary, as well as a multiparty political
system."
   The organization is not wedded to nationalization,
according to Mr. Mandela, who added that some government
intervention will be necessary to bolster the economy and
make it more equitable.
   He said it was a given "that the private sector is an
engine of growth and development, which is critical to the
success of the mixed economy we hope to see in the future
South Africa."
