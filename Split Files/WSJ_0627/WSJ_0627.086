   We wonder: How many Supreme Court justices can dance on
the head of a pin?
   Reading the Supreme Court's right-to-die decision and its
two abortion decisions Monday, it is not clear to us that the
individual members of a society are going to be better served
now that judges have replaced angels atop humankind's
touchiest moral problems. Let's set aside for now the
question of whether the Court was right that an individual
can refuse medical treatment but that Nancy Cruzan's
"somewhat serious conversation with a housemate friend"
didn't meet Missouri's "heightened evidentiary requirements";
or that an abortion law with parental notification is
constitutional if the minor can talk to a judge as an
alternative.

   We are more struck by the fact that the Supreme Court and
courts generally have become the institution to which so many
people now turn for guidance on problems of conscience and
morality.
   Several years ago, we sat in a federal courtroom on Long
Island and watched an appeals-court judge listen to lawyers
litigate one of the Baby Doe cases. The judge heard about
medicine, the rights of infants, the duties of parents and
the obligations of society. At last the judge said that like
other cases now, this one was quite beyond the law's skills
or precedents but that the litigants, their supporters and
the media had gathered on this occasion and wanted him to
somehow figure it all out and render a decision. So he did.
Indeed one of the best right-to-die decisions we've read was
by a New Jersey state judge who just wrote out some sensible,
personal thoughts on the subject.
   Courts have assumed this function partly by volition but
partly by default. Courtrooms have become the last refuge of
a society that has gradually lost faith in the ability of the
institutions that used to provide a coherent framework within
which an individual could form moral or ethical opinions and
reach conclusions.
   As the 2 Live Crew and NEA controversy indicates, the
contemporary moral philosophy of many intellectual leaders
is, anything goes. They are little help. Over the last 15
years, the established Christian churches have abdicated
their authority in the area of individual moral
responsibility, choosing instead to promote "social-justice
issues," which make the churches mainly an adjunct to secular
politics and sociology.
   Few reporters bothered to call a minister or priest for
comment on the right-to-die case. They quite sensibly called
the groups who now do what thinking exists on these personal
questions, such as the United Handicapped Federation or
Concern for the Dying. Indeed as we've argued before, some of
these movements and groups, like the Sierra Club or Friends
of Animals, now give their members the purposefulness once
provided by the churches. But there is an important
difference: Where the churches relied heavily on personal
conscience, their successors rely on the courts.
   "There are some wonderful things here," the director of
legal services for the Society for the Right to Die said of
the Missouri decision. "The Constitution is being applied in
a brand new and revolutionary way."
   We don't see how it can be regarded as good to have the
U.S. Constitution transformed into Holy Writ and judges
serving as confessors for a morally perplexed society.
Justice Scalia pointedly warned in his concurrence that if
the Court insisted on injecting itself into every field of
human activity where irrationality and oppression may
theoretically occur, "it will destroy itself."
   There is no denying that advances in areas such as
medicine have made judgment in some painful circumstances
seem more difficult. Up to a point, legislatures reflecting a
publicly debated consensus have to set some rules. We do not
see, though, how an advanced society is going to maintain its
sense of what is morally right or wrong if it becomes wholly
dependent on courts whose own source of inspiration, as here,
is Twin City Bank v. Nebeker (1897).
