   Heritage Media Corp. said in Dallas that it received
commitments for as much as $220 million in loans to refinance
its outstanding indebtedness and to complete the previously
announced acquisition of New York-based POP Radio Corp.
   The loans, from a group of banks led by Citibank, are
subject to a due-diligence review and further negotiations,
according to Heritage Media, an owner of television and radio
stations.
