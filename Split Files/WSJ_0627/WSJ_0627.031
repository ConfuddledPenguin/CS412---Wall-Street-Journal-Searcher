   LONDON -- Maxwell Communication Corp. reported pretax
profit of #172.3 million ($298.3 million) for the year ended
March 31, below London analysts' expectations.
   The British publishing concern didn't provide directly
comparable figures for the year-earlier period, citing a
change in the company's accounting year and a radical
restructuring of its business. Once largely a printing
concern, Maxwell became a major publishing company with its
recent purchases of Macmillan Inc. and Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp.'s Official Airline Guides unit in the U.S.

   Maxwell said its fiscal 1990 pretax profit was 10% below
the #192 million posted in the 15 months ended March 31,
1989. It added that the fiscal 1990 result was 12% above
#153.6 million, which represents 12/15ths, or an "annualized"
portion, of the #192 million figure. The company last year
moved to a March 31 fiscal year from a calendar reporting
year.
   But at a time when Maxwell says it is eager to boost
investors' awareness of the company, particularly in the
U.S., officials wouldn't provide results for the 12 months
ended March 31, 1989. "There would really be no purpose or
benefit" in doing so, Katherine Pelly, corporate analyst at
Maxwell, said at a news conference.
   Analysts declined to estimate those results, saying the
changes in the accounting year and the company's shift into
publishing made such comparisons difficult. "The whole
company's changed so much that not only are you comparing
apples with oranges in terms of time period, but also very
much with the substance" of the business, said Hank Powell,
an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London.
   But with the fiscal 1990 results falling below analysts'
forecasts, London markets reacted somewhat gloomily to the
news. Maxwell shares fell four pence to 195 pence ($3.38) on
London's Stock Exchange yesterday.
   Analysts voiced particular concern about interest charges
Maxwell has incurred as a result of heavy borrowing to fund
its acquisitions. In fiscal 1990, the company had a net
charge arising from investment income and interest payments
of #108.1 million, compared with #17 million in the 15 months
ended March 31, 1989.
   That charge helped pull profit attributable to
shareholders, or net profit, to #101.1 million in fiscal
1990, compared with #190 million in the earlier 15-month
period. Per-share earnings were 20 pence in fiscal 1990
compared with 24 pence in the earlier period. The company
recommended a final dividend of 8.5 pence a share, boosting
the full-year dividend to 15 pence a share. The dividend in
the previous 15 months was 18 pence a share. Sales totaled
#1.24 billion in fiscal 1990, compared with #1.39 billion in
the previous 15-month period.
   Chairman Robert Maxwell said the company's debt, which
peaked at #2.7 billion last September, has fallen back to
#1.9 billion and "is traveling downward fast." Maxwell hopes
to reduce its debt by selling about $800 million of
"non-strategic businesses" and $150 million of surplus
property. He declined to elaborate.
