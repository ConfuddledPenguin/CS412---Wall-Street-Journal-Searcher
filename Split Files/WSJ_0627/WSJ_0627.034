   PARIS -- Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A. extended its
$90-a-share tender offer for Norton Co. The offer and

were scheduled to expire today.
   In April, Saint-Gobain agreed to acquire Worcester,
Mass.-based Norton for $90 a share, or about $1.9 billion,
outbidding a $75-a-share offer by BTR PLC.
