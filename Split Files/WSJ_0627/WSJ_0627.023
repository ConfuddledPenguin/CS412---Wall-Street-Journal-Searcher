   Remember that well-intentioned advice about
conscientiously researching the financial strength and other
attributes of insurance companies before you buy policies?
Such efforts may be a waste of time.
   Insurance companies routinely sell blocks of policies to
other companies. And policyholders may not even know that
their policies have been transferred.

   Consider the predicament of Joseph and Margaret Barsocchi.
In 1982, they purchased three single-premium deferred
annuities for a total of nearly $7,500 from First Pyramid
Life Insurance, based in their home town of Little Rock, Ark.
Six years later their annuities had been transferred in
succession to three other insurers. The last one, Diamond
Benefit Life Insurance Co., was declared insolvent in late
1988, and the Barsocchis haven't been paid any interest on
their annuities since December 1988.
   Diamond Benefit's court-appointed receiver and various
lawyers are trying to determine which of the three insurers
that held the annuities is responsible to the Arkansas couple
and some 1,400 other people who bought First Pyramid
annuities.
   Policy transfers are "a fact of life" in the insurance
business, said an actuary at one company. While some major
insurers such as Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. say they don't sell
blocks of policies, several thousand policies are transferred
by other firms annually. Life, health and investment-type
policies, such as annuities, are the types most often
transferred because they are longer-term and often can't be
canceled by the insurers.
   An official at the American Council of Life Insurers
estimates that the number of transfers has been increasing,
partly because of the consolidation among life and health
insurers in recent years. "That consolidation is expected to
continue, and the way to consolidate is do assumption deals,"
said a council official.
   Through a procedure called assumption reinsurance, the
buyer takes on the entire obligation, and the policies are
transferred to the books of the new company.
   If the assuming company becomes insolvent, the original
company usually claims it's no longer liable to
policyholders. Holders may have little recourse unless
they're covered by a state guaranty fund and the acquiring
company is licensed in the state where they live. Even then,
holders might not recover a dime for years while the firms
squabble over which one is responsible to the policyholders.
   Policy transfers by insurers aren't rigidly regulated. In
most states, current regulation "doesn't offer any protection
for policyholders," said Joseph Belth, a professor of
insurance at Indiana University. Though transfers generally
are done without policyholders' consent, "Any time a policy
is transferred, it poses potential problems for consumers,"
he said.
   Few states review all these deals. For instance,
California requires approval only when 50% or more of all
policies a company has written, its "book of business," is
being transferred. Other states, such as Pennsylvania and
Arizona, require regulator approval when substantially all of
a company's business is being transferred.
   "In general, life insurers do what they want to do, and
regulators try to keep up," said James L. Hunt, a director of
the National Insurance Consumer Organization, based in
Arlington, Va.
   Regulators defend the practice, noting that policies are
often transferred from weaker to stronger insurers. Sometimes
regulators even arrange transfers.
   But not always. The Barsocchis' experience shows how messy
such transfers can get. Regulators in California recall that
First Pyramid, the company from which the Barsocchis bought
their annuities, ran into financial trouble in late 1983.
(First Pyramid was licensed in California.) Security Benefit
Life Insurance Co. of Topeka, Kan., a top-rated company,
acquired First Pyramid in 1984 and assumed all of its
business in 1986. It issued a certificate of assumption and
notified First Pyramid policyholders that it was responsible
for these policies. This was the only transfer the Barsocchis
knew about.
   A year later, Security Benefit transferred the
single-premium annuities to Life Assurance Co. of
Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. Life Assurance sold the
annuities to Diamond Benefit in 1988.
   Diamond Benefit's receiver claims the assumption
reinsurance agreement with Life Assurance isn't valid, so
Life Assurance is still responsible for these annuities. But
holders may not have a much better chance of recovering their
money from Life Assurance. In April, California regulators
ordered Life Assurance to cease its operations because they
found the company technically insolvent.
   Pennsylvania regulators say they still consider Life
Assurance solvent, though they have monitored it closely for
two years, aware that, among other things, it has reinsurance
pacts with companies that are in financial trouble.
   The Barsocchis are part of a class-action suit in Arkansas
state court against Security Benefit that seeks to recover
some $25 million in funds originally deposited with First
Pyramid. Security Benefit contends that it isn't liable
because it transferred the policies to Life Assurance.
   James Foster, president of Life Assurance, said, "The
transfer of risk has occurred, and Diamond Benefit has the
liability."
   The suit against Security Benefit is based on the
contract-law principle of novation: Duties and obligations of
a contract can't be transferred without the consent of both
parties. The suit contends that because the policyholders
never approved the transfer of their annuities to Life
Assurance, Security Benefit is responsible for these
contracts. Several state courts have upheld the novation
concept.
   Some insurance companies and regulators contend
policyholder approval isn't needed. When Lone Star Life
Insurance Co. acquired a block of disability income policies
from Ohio State Life Insurance Co. last year, it told
policyholders that paying premiums to Lone Star or cashing
benefit checks would be considered evidence that they had
accepted Lone Star as their new insurer and agreed to the
transfer of their policies. The letter from Lone Star didn't
mention that it had a single-C-plus rating from A.M. Best
Co., compared with Ohio State's single-A-plus rating. (Lone
Star's rating was recently upgraded to single-B-minus.)
   But with state regulation all over the lot, people have
little assured recourse other than going to court. New York
won't approve transfers without the policyholders' consent or
if the company that wants to assume a block of business isn't
licensed in the state.
   Some other states require approval by state regulators of
a certificate of assumption, or letter, which notifies
policyholders that their policies have been transferred to
another insurer. Illinois requires the certificate of
approval to include some means for policyholders to indicate
acceptance or rejection of a new insurer. New Hampshire
stipulates that policyholders who don't accept the new
insurer must be allowed by the old company to cancel their
policies without any surrender charges.
   Indiana University's Prof. Belth said being allowed to
cancel a policy without penalties "is simply not enough." If
the canceled policy provides accident or medical expense
coverage, the holder might have developed an illness or
condition that disqualifies him for a new policy with another
company, leaving him uninsured.
   Mr. Belth said a policyholder's greatest protection is the
right to refuse to accept a new carrier. "It means the
consumer must be on guard and ready to refuse to be
transferred, even though the letter from the {assuming}
company makes it sound like a fait accompli."
   Earlier this month, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners set up a task force to study the extent of
current state regulation of these transfers and to develop a
standardized set of regulations for states to consider
adopting.
