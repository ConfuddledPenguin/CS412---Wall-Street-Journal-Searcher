   NEW YORK -- A theater industry group, concerned about the
decline in non-musical plays on Broadway, announced a plan to
encourage production by cutting costs and ticket prices.
   The plan, called the Broadway Alliance, would enable
so-called straight plays to be produced in three underused
Broadway theaters for $400,000 each, half the usual minimum
cost. Similarly, ticket prices, which average about $36 for
Broadway plays and musicals, would be cut to a maximum $24
for orchestra seats, and a minimum $10 for balcony seats.

   The cuts in production and ticket costs would be possible
because of concessions in salary, royalty and manpower and
other costs negotiated with a variety of unions and theater
operators, producers and suppliers. The alliance has
agreements with organizations such as Actors' Equity
Association to reduce the minimum contract salary in its
productions by 25%. The plan allows for profit sharing after
costs have been recouped.
   The plan envisions the production of one-set plays with
small casts to limit operating costs.
   In addition, the three designated theaters in which the
productions will be mounted won't charge rent until
production costs have been recouped. The three theaters are
the Nederlander, the Walter Kerr and either the Belasco or
the Lyceum.
   The alliance grew out of concern among producers and
actors that straight plays were being produced in
off-Broadway theaters. At the suggestion of the League of
American Theatres and Producers, a trade group, a task force
was formed in late 1988 to address the problem of dwindling
straight plays on Broadway.
   Dramatic plays increasingly are finding their way into
production in the about 33 off-Broadway theaters, where
ticket prices average about $22. Off-Broadway theaters are
those outside the mid-town Manhattan theater district with
seating under 500. Union pay scales are often tied to size of
the theater, so the cost of producing a play off-Broadway may
range anywhere from less than $200,000 to as much as
$750,000, according to George Elmer, secretary-treasurer of
the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers, and a
theatrical general manager. There are 38 Broadway theaters,
including one at Lincoln Center.
   Although the Broadway Alliance says that it isn't
competing with off-Broadway theater, members of the task
force conceded that the dramatic plays are being produced
elsewhere.
   The project will run from Sept. 1 through February 1992.
The alliance hopes to raise $1 million for a fund to help
producers complete financing of plays.
