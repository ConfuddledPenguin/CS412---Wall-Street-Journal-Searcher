   NEW YORK -- Many regional brokerage stocks have sizzled
this year, far outpacing the shares of big securities firms.
But some money managers think the runup may be over.
   Based far from Wall Street, regionals are smaller brokers
that focus more on clients around the corner than around the
world. Three big winners -- Alex. Brown, Raymond James
Financial and Legg Mason -- each have soared about 30% this
year, while bigger brokerage stocks have been flat.

   But while the long-term outlook for regionals still is
bright, now isn't the time to plow in, some managers warn.
   Because regional brokers are heavily dependent on the
activity of individual investors, their stocks are often
viewed as a proxy of small-investor interest in the stock
market. And with the regionals' runup, and no strong signs
that individual investors have stormed back to stocks in a
big way, some managers have recently pared back their
holdings of regionals' shares.
   Jeffrey Vinik, portfolio manager for the $510 million
Fidelity Contrafund, says he has "significantly" cut his
position in Raymond James and A.G. Edwards in recent weeks.
Regionals "went from being great buys to solid holds," he
says. "In terms of buying, I'd wait until they're cheaper."
   Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage-industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities, sees another potential pitfall:
The continued sluggish volume at the nation's stock
exchanges. The Big Board has averaged just 156.5 million
shares a day this year, down 17% from its 1987 peak.
   "What's going to happen if volume stays as it's been, and
we don't see much sequential improvement in {regionals'}
earnings?" Mr. Eckenfelder asks. "People will start to chip
away" at the stocks. He says the phone calls he's been
getting on regionals lately have been from investors thinking
about selling to lock in their profits.
   That should give pause for investors still hoping to cash
in on the much-ballyhooed regional-firm resurgence. While big
national securities firms such as Shearson Lehman Hutton and
Merrill Lynch have faltered since the 1987 stock-market
crash, several regional firms have recently posted record
profits. Regional brokers have been helped by a modest pickup
in individual investor interest in stocks, and by regionals'
healthy investment advisory operations, particularly mutual
funds.
   Regionals also have a head start on the national firms in
cutting costs and focusing on a few profitable businesses.
"These firms never got fat and happy," says Preston Athey,
who runs the $32 million T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund.
   Mr. Athey still believes regionals are cheap. Raymond
James currently sells at about eight times trailing 12-month
earnings and Legg Mason at about 11.5, he points out; Alex.
Brown trades at "only" a 40% premium to book value. But
"they're no longer on the screaming bargain basement table,"
he concedes.
   And regional brokers aren't "widow and orphan" stocks
either, Mr. Athey warns. They are volatile; like most
brokerage stocks, they tend to outperform stock-market
averages in good markets and underperform in bad. And because
most regionals are small stocks with a modest number of
shares outstanding, it doesn't take much to move them.
Regional brokerage stocks fell out of bed during the 1987
crash.
   Indeed, some top portfolio managers steer clear of
regional brokers because of their turbulence. Harry Hutzler,
who runs the $660 million AIM Weingarten Fund, says he no
longer buys regionals after being burned in past years on
Legg Mason. "With many other types of stocks, good earnings
tend to persist,"he says, but "not with regional brokerage
stocks."
   Even the most bullish managers aren't betting more money
on regional brokers. Steven Barry, co-manager of the $350
million Alliance Quasar Fund, says these shares could soar if
small investors return to stocks in a big way. But that
hasn't happened yet. Meanwhile, "I don't want to have a big
exposure here," he says.
   Regional brokerage firms can't be painted with the same
brush, of course. Here's how some money managers view the
prospects for three recently-hot regional brokers:
                                                                                                       

   ALEX. BROWN: One of the largest of the regionals, the
Baltimore-based firm has a solid clientele of wealthy
individuals and institutions. Alex. Brown also is active in
investment banking, and maintains a strong presence in the
market for initial public offerings; the recent surge in IPOs
has been one reason the stock has risen lately. Add its
strength in technology stocks -- another recent Wall Street
darling -- and it's not hard to see why T. Rowe Price's Mr.
Athey dubs it the "regional Morgan Stanley."
                                                                                                       

   LEGG MASON: Also based in Baltimore, Legg Mason depends
heavily on small investors. One of its strengths is a
well-defined money-management side; its highly regarded Legg
Mason Value Trust helps the firm draw assets. Shearson Lehman
analyst Dean Eberling calls Legg Mason an "asset manager
disguised as a regional broker." Mr. Eberling thinks the
stock is undervalued on a price-to-book basis when its book
value is adjusted to reflect an estimated $3.75 a share
addition for its Western Asset Management unit relative to
what Legg paid for it in 1986.
                                                                                                       

   RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL: This firm, based in St.
Petersburg, Fla., also is heavily dependent on individual
investors and has a burgeoning money-management arm. It does
a big business in stocks of small local companies,
particularly those based in Florida. One reason Fidelity's
Mr. Vinik has pared his holding is Raymond James's recently
stated intention to slow its growth. "They want to keep
things under control," Mr. Vinik says.

   Competitive pressures bearing down on the New York Stock
Exchange are disrupting the exchange's clubby atmosphere.
   Witness the recent election of Benjamin F. Edwards III,
the chairman and chief executive of regional broker A.G.
Edwards, to the exchange's board of directors.
   Mr. Edwards received the lowest number of votes of any
director on the uncontested slate, after his name was crossed
off by members casting 23 out of a total of 793.5 votes on
the June 7 ballot, according to an exchange member who has
seen the results.
   The member said it was unusual that a selection of the
nominating committee was controversial enough to compel a
number of members to strike a name.
   Members attribute the gesture to unhappiness that regional
brokers such as A.G. Edwards and Quick &amp; Reilly send some
orders away from the exchange. A.G. Edwards sends some trades
to off-exchange trader Bernard L. Madoff. Not only does A.G.
Edwards earn commissions on the trades, but it also receives
a penny-per-share rebate from Mr. Madoff. However, sending
orders away from exchanges reduces the stock market's
efficiency, Big Board members argue.
   Mr. Edwards says he doesn't think the vote was
significantly unfavorable. He added, "New York is still the
best market in the world, and we still favor them. But we
feel they have to be competitive."
