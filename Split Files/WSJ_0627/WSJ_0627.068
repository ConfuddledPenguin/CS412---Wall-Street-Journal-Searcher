   LONDON -- The 1989-1990 art auction season ended not with
a bang, but with an uneasy silence.
   The majority of paintings and sculpture for sale this
week, which carried an estimated total value of over $300
million, failed to sell. There was robust, even frantic,
bidding for the highest quality artwork, and for the lovely,
sentimental Impressionist paintings that Japanese collectors
strongly favor. But what wasn't pretty or wasn't very good
failed to find buyers.

   The summer London sales are crucial for the auction
houses, and for dealers, because they represent the "bread
and butter" sales of midrange paintings and sculpture.
   At Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s London auction room here last
night, 58% of the artworks were "bought-in," or failed to
sell. The highest price reached was a relatively paltry $3.4
million for Marc Chagall's "Soleil au Cheval Rouge." It was
Sotheby's last major art auction until October.
   The sale was "very despondent," said Lord Gowrie, chairman
of Sotheby's International, the European unit of New
York-based Sotheby's Holdings. He said pre-sale estimates for
works of art had been set perhaps 10%-30% too high,
discouraging potential bidders. He said the company will be
more conservative in the future.
   At Christie's International PLC's auction of Impressionist
and Modern paintings Monday evening, slightly more than half
the works failed to sell. But the brisk demand for the art
that did attract bidders still enabled Christie's to earn
roughly three-quarters of the total dollar amounts it had
expected.
   Overall, collectors and art speculators balked at buying
anything but top-rank art or cut-rate bargains.
   Buying patterns split along well-recognized lines of
quality. Also the brighter colored paintings outperformed the
more difficult or dour, such as a brown-and-gray Vincent van
Gogh that failed to find a buyer at Christie's. In addition,
works by Pierre-Auguste Renior, which have been abundant on
the auction block recently, didn't meet with a good response.
   But bidding was furious for an uncharacteristically
cheerful 1901 Pablo Picasso that featured fresh-faced
children launching sailboats on a pond. Two Japanese buyers
vied against a European collector, bidding the painting up to
$23.5 million, more than double the high end of Christie's
pre-sale estimate of $7 million to $10 million.
   There appeared to be more activity than usual in the
after-sale market, when chastened sellers agree to bargain.
After the auctions, sellers often lower the minimum price
they'll accept in exchange for not having to reclaim an
artwork that's been publicly "burnt" by failure to sell.
   And while speculation was rife earlier in the year that
Japanese dealers and collectors were scared out of the art
market by weakness in the Tokyo stock market, it is instead
the Americans who are on the sidelines. Americans have been
"net sellers, not buyers," said James Roundell, head of the
Impressionist and Modern Paintings department of Christie's
International.
   Only two flagship sales remain. Later this week, both
Sotheby's and Christie's auction contemporary art.
   The Sotheby's sale will be the first in which some objects
of art from the Pierre Matisse Gallery, acquired in a
controversial joint venture by Sotheby's last April, hit the
market.
   Sotheby's paid $142.8 million for the Matisse collection,
fending off charges from some dealers that it was moving out
of the role of disinterested market-maker into the business
of dealing.
