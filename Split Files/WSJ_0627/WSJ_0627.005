   PITTSBURGH -- National Steel Corp. named Kokichi Hagiwara
chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Howard M.
Love, who remains honorary chairman.
   The management move reflects the change in ownership of
the steelmaker. National Intergroup Inc., which owned 50% of
National Steel, announced in April its plans to sell all but
10% of its steel equity to NKK Corp. of Japan. Mr. Hagiwara
is a managing director of NKK, while Mr. Love is chairman and
chief executive of National Intergroup. Mr. Love also intends
to step down from National Intergroup next March, once a
restructuring of that company is completed.

   Ronald H. Doerr, National Steel's former executive vice
president, was tapped to succeed Mr. Hagiwara as president
and chief operating officer.
   National Steel also reduced the size of the board to five,
from six, and changed its makeup to give better
representation to NKK. Mssrs. Hagiwara and Love will remain
on the board; they will be joined by the following new
members: Mr. Doerr; Osamu Sawaragi, executive vice president
of NKK, in charge of its Iron &amp; Steel division; and Yoshito
Tokumitsu, National Steel's vice president -- distribution
and services. Mr. Sawaragi will serve as vice chairman.
   In a related move, National Intergroup said it completed
the first stage of its equity steel sale to NKK, by selling
20% of the company to NKK for $146.6 million. As a result,
National Intergroup will record a non-recurring charge of
$14.8 million in the first fiscal quarter ending June 30. The
company had expected a $13 million charge.
   In the year-ago first quarter, National Intergroup earned
$13 million, or 53 cents a share, on sales of $853.4 million.
The year-ago period included a $1.5 million loss from
discontinued operations and a $6 million extraordinary
credit.
