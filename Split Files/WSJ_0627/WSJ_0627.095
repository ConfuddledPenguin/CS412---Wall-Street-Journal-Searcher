   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to lay out new
Latin American economic policies that emphasize helping the
region cope with its heavy debt to foreign governments and
attract more outside investment, administration officials
said.
   The president is set to announce the policies as early as
today, the officials said. In recent days, the Treasury's
undersecretary for international affairs, David Mulford, has
briefed Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and other senior administration officials on the new
Latin American approach, administration officials said.
Spokespersons for the White House and Treasury declined to
comment.

   With substantial White House involvement, the new Latin
American policy was developed in the administration's
interagency process over the past several months.
Administration officials said they regard the new measures as
a supplement to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's debt
strategy, which thus far hasn't matched the expectations that
it first aroused.
   That strategy put a greater emphasis on offering heavily
indebted nations, mainly in Latin America, some relief on
their foreign bank debt. Mexico, the Philippines and Costa
Rica have negotiated agreements under the new strategy, and
Venezuela is in the process of doing so.
   Any administration efforts to help the Latin Americans
address their debts owed to foreign governments will be
particularly welcome in Congress. The U.S. is generally the
largest government creditor to Latin American countries. The
House Banking Committee agreed to urge the White House to
work through the Paris Club of western creditor governments
to provide more official debt relief to nations in Eastern
Europe, Latin America and Africa.
   The Bush administration is eager to try to do more for
Latin America, which has generally had little or no economic
growth over the past several years. There is a widespread
feeling at the top of the administration that now is the time
to offer Latin America more technical aid and other
relatively inexpensive forms of help, as well as to try to
help the region entice foreign investment capital.
   President Bush plans to visit Brazil, Argentina and Chile
in September. Advisers said he is particularly eager to
ensure that Latin America is able to prosper economically,
particularly as many nations in the area -- including
Argentina, Brazil and Chile -- have only recently returned to
democracy. Senior administration officials, also said they
are eager to ensure that Latin America isn't neglected,
especially when so much attention has been focused on Eastern
Europe over the past several months.
   Other cabinet members also have been visiting the region
recently. Mr. Mosbacher just returned from a week-long trip
to Latin America, and Mrs. Hills last month addressed the
Organization of American States annual meeting in Asuncion,
Paraguay, and visited Argentina and Brazil. Secretary of
State James Baker and other cabinet members will visit Mexico
this August for an annual bilateral cabinet gathering.
