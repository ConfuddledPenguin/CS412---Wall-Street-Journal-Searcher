   Glenfed Inc., the parent company of Glendale Federal Bank,
said it has amended its dividend reinvestment plan in an
effort "to curb abuse" of the plan's voluntary cash-payment
provision.
   Effective Aug. 1, Glenfed said the discount for purchases
with reinvested dividends will be reduced to 2% from 5%, in
order to discourage the investor from selling short, a
strategy used to make a quick profit.

<TEXT>
   The Glendale, Calif., company said its common stock price
has been hurt recently because of pressure exerted by
arbitrage transactions by participants in the voluntary
cash-payment feature of the plan.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Glenfed closed at $12.50, up 12.5 cents.
