   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
an $83.6 billion fiscal 1991 spending bill that would
increase federal low-income housing aid by $3.8 billion and
cut virtually all funding for President Bush's initiative to
explore the moon and Mars.
   Spending for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would grow by 17% from the current fiscal year
to nearly $14.3 billion, but the cut from the Mars project is
nonetheless a defeat for the administration. The White House
will try to restore funding in the Senate, but as
deficit-reduction talks proceed, the demand for new spending
cuts will only heighten competition with such other NASA
priorities as the continuing space station and shuttle
programs.

   Yesterday's committee action came as the full House
adopted a nearly $10.6 billion bill funding portions of the
State, Justice, and Commerce Departments and incorporating
increased appropriations to expedite the government's
prosecution of savings-and-loan fraud cases. Final approval
came on a 368-55 roll call, after back-to-back votes in which
the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back amendments
to impose 5% and 2% across-the-board cuts.
   However important politically, the $75 million for S&amp;L
cases is a relatively small part of the overall spending
bill, which includes major increases in U.S. contributions to
the United Nations and affiliated health and nutrition
organizations. Though less than requested by the president,
appropriations to these accounts would grow by 28% to $787.6
million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, with $115
million allocated to peace-keeping operations, a 41% increase
from fiscal 1990.
   Second only to the annual Pentagon bill in total
discretionary spending, the $83.6 billion measure reported
from the Appropriations Committee represents an amalgam of
interests running from old cities to the newest initiatives
of science. Apart from the major housing and space accounts,
more than $6 billion is provided for the Environmental
Protection Agency, and appropriations for the Veterans
Affairs Department would grow to nearly $31.3 billion, or the
equivalent of the entire transportation appropriations bill
for the coming fiscal year.
   Increased medical and benefit costs reflect an aging
veterans population nationwide, but the totals also include
parochial construction projects that run from hospital beds
to parking spaces and new cemeteries. An estimated $18
million is allocated for an Ann Arbor medical center in the
home state of Michigan Rep. Bob Traxler, chairman of the
subcommittee that drafted the bill, for example, and a $6
million amendment attached yesterday contains language
earmarking the treatment funds for hospitals in Michigan,
Massachusetts and New Jersey.
   The increased funding for housing reflects a major
initiative set by the House-passed budget resolution this
spring, and the money is calculated to support more than
118,000 subsidized units, or 60% above the current level.
Within these totals, an estimated $2.7 billion is provided to
improve existing public housing for the poorest tenants, an
increase of more than 25% from current funding and about $900
million more than the president requested.
   The large spending increases will be challenged under any
deficit-reduction compromise with the administration, but the
Appropriations Committee leadership has quietly used the
process to stake out priorities for the Democratic-controlled
chamber. Though their bills have yet to be released publicly,
subcommittees covering transportation, health, and education
accounts have funded initiatives of their own. As lawmakers
commit themselves to the new figures, it could be more
difficult to impose subsequent cuts.
   For example, Rep. William Natcher (D., Ky.), whose
jurisdiction includes the Departments of Education and Health
and Human Services, is proposing to increase compensatory
education funding for young, low-income children in public
schools to $6.2 billion, reflecting a nearly $1 billion
increase in aid to local districts. A comparable increase is
assumed for the National Institutes of Health, where an
estimated $8.6 billion would be provided in direct or reserve
funds.
   Within transportation accounts, an estimated $30.78
billion bill reported recently from subcommittee would
substantially increase funding for airport grants to $1.8
billion after Oct. 1, while highway trust fund obligations
would grow more than 25% to $14.5 billion.
   Amtrak is tentatively slated to receive about $632
million, and while less than the administration's request, an
estimated $2.1 billion is provided for facilities and
equipment accounts for the Federal Aviation Administration,
nearly 25% above current levels.
   Amid this largess, the appropriations leadership has found
money to benefit -- and woo -- some of its historic
tormentors. With much sarcasm, the full committee yesterday
approved a $479,000 community-development provision sought by
Deputy GOP Whip Robert Walker for his home district in
Pennsylvania.
   The transportation subcommittee similarly found $2 million
for a southwest Minnesota highway project requested by Rep.
Bill Frenzel, the ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, and among those signing letters supporting a
monorail system in Orange County, Calif., was Rep. William
Dannemeyer (R., Calif.), who has been regularly proposing 5%
across-the-board cuts.
   This generosity contrasts with the discipline exacted
against one of the Democrats' own, Colorado Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, who voted against the committee leadership this
spring in a fight over House mailing costs. At a subsequent
House whips meeting, Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.) criticized
those who defected, and parochial requests by Rep. Schroeder
were stripped from the transportation bill.
