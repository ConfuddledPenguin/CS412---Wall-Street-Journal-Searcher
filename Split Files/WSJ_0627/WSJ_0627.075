   DUBLIN -- European Community leaders agreed to design a
major aid program for the Soviet Union.
   Though the agreement at a summit of the 12 heads of the EC
member nations was short on specifics, it set the EC on the
road to another major foreign-policy exercise, atop an
already ambitious program of aid to revision-minded Eastern
European countries.

   The leaders declined to set any specific levels of aid to
the U.S.S.R., deciding to wait until two detailed studies on
problems in the Soviet economy are completed. The first study
will address short-term financial strains, such as the
growing payments crisis. The second is to try to identify
ways the West can help the Soviets move away from a centrally
planned economy and develop a more efficient and
market-oriented economic infrastructure.
   The vagueness of the EC commitment was viewed as a
disappointment for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand. People at the meeting
said Mr. Kohl had suggested that at least $15 billion is
needed for any assistance to the Soviet Union to be
meaningful, though Mr. Kohl denied he had pushed for any
particular level of aid. Moreover, West German officials
pointed out that they hadn't expected a final decision on the
aid program at this meeting. Mr. Kohl said he "couldn't have
expected anything more."
   EC Commission President Jacques Delors, a leading advocate
of an EC role in helping the Soviets, was clearly pleased.
The leaders put the commission in charge of devising
proposals for the aid program, which is to be considered by
EC ministers by autumn. The commission will consult not only
with Western allies but with major international economic
organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund. Mr.
Delors will visit Moscow next month on a previously planned
visit.
   In addition to the EC initiative toward the Soviet Union,
the two-day summit set the dates for two treaty-amending
conferences aimed at strengthening the EC's powers over
economic, monetary and political matters. The leaders took a
range of foreign-policy positions, and, after some debate,
decided to preserve sanctions against South Africa.
   The decision regarding the Soviet Union comes as the Bush
administration agonizes about whether to join in the aid
effort. The EC plans to describe its approach at the economic
summit of the seven industrial powers in Houston next month.
But European leaders made it clear that the EC aid program
would proceed independently of any U.S. or Japanese support.
   "We are sending a clear signal to Houston," said Irish
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who was chairman of the
summit. "Our statement expresses full support of the economic
and political process of restructuring undertaken by
President {Mikhail} Gorbachev."
   The Dublin agreement is an illustration of how differently
Europeans and Americans view developments in the Soviet
Union. In the U.S., aid to the Soviets has been stymied
partly by objections to Moscow's handling of the Lithuanian
independence movement and to continued Soviet military aid to
Cuba and other Third World dictatorships.
   But in Europe, these worries have been overridden by even
deeper concerns about the stability of a nuclear-armed
superpower that appears to be on the verge of collapse.
Moreover, European countries are trying to pave the way for
German unification by bringing Soviet Union into a closer
economic relationship.
   "We're very ready to consider financial assistance,
provided it is clearly linked to economic reform," British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.
   The leaders also instructed the EC Commission to study a
plan put forward by Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers to set
up an energy network providing for increased purchases of
Soviet oil and natural gas. This plan, Mr. Lubbers argued,
would further the Europeans' overall goal of helping to
integrate the Soviet Union into the international economy.
   Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Delors and Mr. Lubbers all warned that
the West could end up wasting its money if it poured cash
into the Soviet Union without insisting on deep-seated
economic changes. Mr. Delors reasoned that mere financial aid
won't help cure long-term structural maladies in the Soviet
economic system, such as a poor distribution network and the
lack of a banking system and a convertible currency.
   Mr. Delors said, "Gorbachev has been there five years, and
so far, the reforms have not produced the results that were
expected."
