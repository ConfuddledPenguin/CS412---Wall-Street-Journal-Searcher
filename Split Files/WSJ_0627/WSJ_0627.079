   APPEALS JUDGES SPIKE an IRS argument against deducting
home-loan points.
   Prepaid interest, or points, is deductible currently if
paid "in connection with the purchase or improvement" of your
main home; but points paid in refinancing a mortgage must be
deducted over the life of the loan. In 1988, the Tax Court
voted 8-3 to uphold the IRS's denial of a current deduction
to Mr. and Mrs. James R. Huntsman of Stillwater, Minn., who
paid points on a 30-year mortgage to refinance a three-year
purchase loan and an improvement loan.

   But the eighth-circuit appeals court has reversed that
ruling as too narrow an interpretation. Chief Judge Lay says
the couple got the three-year loan as "an integrated step"
toward long-term financing of the purchase; they didn't
refinance just for a lower interest rate. Thus, the new loan
was "in connection with" the purchase, and the $4,440 in
points is deductible currently.
   A student, David B. Clark, in the University of
Minnesota's Tax Law Clinic argued the winning appeal.
                                                                                                       

   DOORS ARE OPENED to pension funds' investments in
real-estate partnerships.
   Exempt entities' income from debt-financed assets
generally is taxable. Pension funds and schools may escape
tax on debt-financed real-estate investments, on certain
conditions; but the rules have inhibited investments in
partnerships, the form preferred by most developers. Now IRS
Notice 90-41 has removed major barriers. Most important, it
tells how the exempt entities can negotiate a preferred
return on an investment without making the income taxable.
   Also, says Alan R. Hollander, a Boston lawyer, the notice
enables the exempt entities to become real-estate partners
without assuming a share of the risks of hazardous wastes,
uninsured personal injury, and like liabilities. "Pension
funds don't want hazardous-waste risk," Hollander says. "That
had held up many partnership deals where the developer would
take the risk, but the IRS said the funds had to remain
liable."
                                                                                                       

   SUMMER READING? This 38-ounce volume will hold down your
beach towel.
   We lied. The House Ways and Means Committee's roundup of
tax-simplification proposals by officials, interest groups,
and public-spirited real people runs only about 1,200 pages,
not 1,300. After digestion, Chairman Rostenkowski (D., Ill.)
plans hearings. Abolition aside, the most popular targets
include minimum taxes, passive-loss rules, pensions, employee
benefits, estate and gift taxes, and a passel of issues for
multinational businesses. Pleas for a flat tax on gross
personal income or a national sales or value-added tax pop up
a lot.
   The Treasury would simplify estimated-tax penalties,
delete shelter registrations, and rework dependency
definitions and many international, benefits, and bankruptcy
provisions. The joint-tax-committee staff focuses on family
issues, nonbusiness interest deductions, pensions, and many
business, foreign and exempt-bond matters. The Ways and Means
staff adds its own suggestions in these and several other
areas.
   Make members of Congress do their own returns, many
citizens demand.
                                                                                                       

   REDUCED PENALTIES for businesses that fail to file Form
W-2 wage or 1099 payment reports on time, or give faulty
data, were enacted last year for concerns that report
correctly by Aug. 1. But Notice 90-45 says the IRS this year
will waive penalties for corrections filed by Oct. 1,
although this later deadline doesn't apply to forms that
weren't filed when due.
                                                                                                       

   THUMBS UP SUMS UP this ruling on IRS summonses by a U.S.
judge in Wichita, Kan.: The IRS may compel 18 taxpayers to
appear in person for audit interviews. The Taxpayer Bill of
Rights doesn't let taxpayers send representatives in their
stead in response to administrative summonses.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN DISPLACED Britain as the top recipient of
U.S.-source dividends, interest, and other payments to
foreign concerns and nonresident aliens in 1987; it got $4.46
billion. The IRS says the total outflow rose 4% from 1986's
to $22.7 billion.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT EFFORTS can bring us to grips with arm's-length
pricing, the IRS says.
   It has a plan to cope with an arcane, troubling issue for
itself and multinational companies: how to set arm's-length
transfer prices for products one unit sells to a related unit
in another country. Prices determine where the income is
taxed -- raising specters of avoidance for the IRS and of
unfair double taxation for corporations. The huge sums at
stake often provoke long, costly litigation. So the IRS is
about to issue a procedure letting companies seek advance
approval of proposed pricing methods.
   The IRS also would help get approvals from other nations.
IRS official Charles Triplett figures at least 750 companies
-- half U.S., half foreign -- could benefit. Companies like
the idea, but have misgivings about many details in a draft
of the plan. The Tax Executives Institute, representing
company officials, is concerned about the masses of
confidential and economic data that must be submitted; it
also is uncertain about the value of an advance ruling
because of terms that would favor the IRS.
   The IRS's Triplett says some details do need work. He adds
that an objective approach requires trust on both sides.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Alcoholism doesn't excuse Gerald D. Handke of St.
Paul, Minn., from civil fraud penalties, says the Tax Court:
He kept false records, not inadequate ones. . . . The IRS
expects personal-return filings to rise to 120.2 million in
1997 from 111.5 million this year and 109.9 million last
year.
