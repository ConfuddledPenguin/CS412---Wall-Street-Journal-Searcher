   West Co., Phoenixville, Pa., said it expects to report a
drop in second-quarter earnings that "could be greater than
50%" because of production problems in the U.S. and a
curtailment of business in Brazil.
   For the quarter ended July 2, 1989, the maker of
specialized packaging for the pharmaceutical industry
reported net income of $6.8 million, or 42 cents a share, on
sales of $79.5 million.

   West cited two unrelated reasons for the anticipated
earnings decline. The first was the discovery of substandard
raw materials that forced a halt in production. The company
said it had to conduct new testing and inspections before it
could begin output of a replacement product.
   The second reason, West said, was a series of changes in
Brazilian monetary and fiscal policy, imposed in recent
months. Those changes "substantially curtailed" West's
activity in Brazil.
   Rene L. Guerster, West's president and chief executive
officer, said the expected lower results will include a
reserve for expenses related to the raw-material problem. He
didn't quantify the reserve.
   However, Mr. Guerster noted that West has resumed
production and that Brazilian operations are returning to
normal.
