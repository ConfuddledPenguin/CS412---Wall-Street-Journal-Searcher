   WASHINGTON -- Many top executives blame the lagging
quality of American goods and services on a lack of
commitment from workers rather than on themselves, according
to a new poll.
   Philip Crosby Associates Inc., a Winter Park, Fla.,
consulting firm that specializes in workplace-quality issues,
released a Gallup poll showing that chief executive officers
acknowledge America's problems with quality. But the
consulting firm said that executives are wrongly denying
their own responsibility for the problem.

   According to the Gallup survey of 401 chief executive
officers of U.S. companies, 62% said lack of managerial
attention doesn't affect quality, 70% said pressure for
short-term profits isn't a quality problem and 20% admit that
manufacturing speedups hamper quality. Almost 300 of the
chief executives run companies with sales of more than $75
million a year, said George Gallup, the pollster's
co-chairman.
   Lance Arrington, president of Philip Crosby, said it's
good that U.S. top executives are no longer reluctant to
admit that foreign competitors are doing a better-quality job
than they are. But he warned, "When executives look only to
the work force, only to those people who discover the defect
. . . they are ignoring the fact that the real problem most
likely rests somewhere back up the line, perhaps too close to
senior management decisions for comfort." Mr. Arrington, a
former ITT Corp. executive, said he and his firm have
counseled many U.S. and foreign companies on quality
training.
   Contrary to the views expressed in the Gallup poll, lack
of management attention, a drive for short-term profits and
manufacturing-speed demands have a crucial negative effect on
quality, Mr. Arrington said.
   While most executives don't seem to realize it, "{quality}
is often impaired by all of these three pressures a
significant portion of the time," Mr. Arrington said.
   Mr. Arrington's views tend to jibe with the conclusions of
the Commission on Skills of the Workplace, a 35-member group
formed by a former unit of Carnegie Corp. The commission last
week issued a report saying, in part, that corporate
management needs to reorganize the workplace in ways that
give workers more authority, while training them better, to
improve product quality and productivity.
   The Gallup survey confirms "the overwhelming need for
management to educate, train and instill a commitment to
quality . . . from the executive suite to the production
floor," Mr. Arrington said. He estimated that as much as 40%
of companies' service-oriented effort is wasted because it
involves correcting poor-quality work or planning for
expected defects.
   Nearly half of the poll respondents who have
quality-improvement programs developed them in the past four
years, but too many of them use "less than effective"
methods, the consultant said.
