   NEW YORK -- Citicorp took another swipe at American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s popular new Universal credit
card.
   Citicorp said it is offering its Visa cardholders the
ability to charge long-distance telephone calls at rates as
much as 22% lower than AT&amp;T's standard calling-card rates.
The long-distance discount, which has been offered by smaller
banks for almost a year, will be provided by MCI
Communications Corp.

   The banking giant is following in the footsteps of AT&amp;T
itself, whose own 10% discount off its standard rates is one
of the features that has helped it open more than a million
new Universal Visa and MasterCard charge accounts in the
three months that the card has been available.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T yesterday questioned Citicorp's claim
of big savings on long-distance calls. "Rates are usually
very competitive between us, MCI and Sprint. The consumer has
to look at that as saying up to 22%," he said.
   There's plenty at stake for Citicorp in this latest
challenge to its dominance in the credit-card business. Last
year, Citicorp's credit-card subsidiary generated more than
$600 million in profit. With more than 37 million cards
outstanding around the world, the company isn't taking kindly
to AT&amp;T's efforts to muscle into the credit-card business.
   This isn't the first effort by Citicorp to stymie the AT&amp;T
card. A month ago, Citicorp and three other big banks with
substantial credit-card businesses -- Chase Manhattan Corp.,
BankAmerica Corp. and MNC Financial Corp. -- asked the
Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Communications Commission
and the Georgia State Banking Department to determine whether
the AT&amp;T card business violates banking and communications
laws. In April, Citicorp transferred $30 million of its
telecommunications business from AT&amp;T to MCI.
   Citicorp claims that it's been considering offering
cardholders long-distance phone service for some time. "The
idea has always been there," said a Citicorp spokesman. "Was
the AT&amp;T offering one part of the decision? Sure. But we
don't react to competition. We react to what our customers
tell us they want."
   Richard Srednicki, business manager for Citibank Visa and
MasterCard, said the bank has only tested the idea of phone
service with cardholders in the last few weeks, but that it
has received a "tremendously positive response." He added
that while it's difficult to tell if Citibank has lost any
cardholders to the new AT&amp;T card, "it's minimal, if any at
all."
   The new phone service is available immediately to Citibank
Visa cardholders and will soon become available to Citibank
MasterCard holders in a few months. The savings estimate is
based on a 10-minute long-distance call during daylight
hours.
   The service that Citibank is offering isn't anything new
to many Visa cardholders at other banks. An MCI spokesman
said the Citibank service is merely a "branded" version of
the Visa Phone service that MCI has made available to some
150 banks since last July.
   While Citicorp may be scrambling to compete with AT&amp;T's
long-distance telephone feature, there's another feature of
the AT&amp;T Universal card that Citicorp hasn't the least
interest in matching: no annual card fee ever for anyone who
signs up this year.
   "We're not planning on cutting fees," said Mr. Srednicki.
