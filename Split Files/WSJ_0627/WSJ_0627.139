   NEW YORK -- Reports that President Bush acknowledged the
need for increased tax revenue to trim the budget deficit
sparked a brief bond market rally yesterday.
   Mr. Bush's remarks initially cheered the credit markets
because a smaller deficit would likely reduce the
government's borrowing needs. That, in turn, would ease
supply pressures and create more room for interest rates to
fall.

   But the euphoria didn't last very long. As bond prices
moved higher, Wall Street's big bond dealers were caught
holding short positions and wound up with large trading
losses. The surprise rally made it more difficult to generate
investor interest in the government's $11.25 billion two-year
note auction. And Mr. Bush's statement, which triggered the
rally in the first place, was later downplayed by other
Republican politicians, leaving dealers and investors
confused and frustrated.
   "It was a difficult morning for the street," said John
Costas, co-manager of trading at First Boston Corp. Although
the Treasury's two-year note auction proceeded smoothly, he
said the auction would have gone much better had prices not
surged ahead of the sale.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped nearly
one point after Mr. Bush's statement, ended 1/2 point higher
for a gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, fell to 8.51%.
   Traders said the rally forced dealers to scramble to cover
their "shorts." These dealers were betting that bond prices
would fall as a huge supply of new securities hit the market.
In a short sale, dealers and professional traders sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities. That
strategy backfired yesterday, when prices rose instead and
dealers had to cover their money-losing shorts by purchasing
bonds from other dealers.
   "When we got the Bush statement on the tape, it caused a
short squeeze," said Jeffrey A. Fagan, a trading manager at
Discount Corp. of New York, a primary dealer of government
bonds.
   Meanwhile, the lower-than-expected yields discouraged some
retail investors from buying the Treasury's new two-year
notes. "We did not see a lot of customer interest in the two
year notes," said Mr. Fagan.
   The notes were sold at an average yield of 8.41%. That was
down from 8.52% average yield at the previous two-year note
auction May 23 and was the lowest yield at a two-year note
auction since 8.21% on Jan. 24, 1990.
   Lacy Hunt, an economist at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc.
termed the auction "OK to slightly weak." And he said the
unenthusiastic response to the two-year notes does not bode
well for today's sale of $8.25 billion of four-year notes.
   One sign of lukewarm investor demand for the two-year
notes was that the Treasury received only 2.21 bids for every
one it accepted, the lowest bid-to-cover ratio at a two-year
note sale since August 1988. The average bid-to-cover ratio
at the previous 12 two-year note auctions was 2.70-to-1,
according to Reid, Thunberg &amp; Company, Inc.
   Demand from individual investors was lighter than at
previous auctions. Individual investors typically buy at
Treasury auctions by placing noncompetitive tenders, agreeing
to accept the price and yield set by competitive bidding.
Noncompetitive tenders at yesterday's two-year note sale
totaled $1.49 billion, down from $1.66 billion at the
two-year note sale in May and from $1.90 billion in April.
   Still, in when-issued trading activity, the yield on the
two-year notes fell slightly to 8.40%, a sign that demand
picked up for the new notes after the auction was completed.
The new four-year notes to be sold today were quoted
yesterday at yields of 8.49%, down 0.05 percentage point.
                                                                                                       

   Asset- Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   New issuance of asset-backed securities heated up again
after a brief pause from last week's frenetic pace.
   Two new issues totaling $1.39 billion were priced
yesterday, on the heels of nearly $4 billion of new
asset-backed securities last week.
   The offerings are a $997 million Household Finance Corp.
deal backed by home-equity loans and a $397 million Norwest
Bank Minnesota issue backed by retail installment sales
contracts and installment loans secured by new and used autos
and light trucks. Household Finance, a consumer and
commercial financing concern, is a unit of Household
International Inc., and Norwest Bank is a unit of Norwest
Corp.
   Both were priced by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The Household Finance offering is in three classes, with
initial rates ranging from 8.525% to 8.875%.
   In the Norwest deal, the offering has a coupon rate of
9.20%, priced at 99 27/32 to yield 9.217%.
   In other primary market activity, the Federal National
Mortgage Association announced that it priced a $500 million
real estate mortgage investment conduit offering, backed by
Fannie Mae 9.5% securities, through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   In secondary activity, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities for July delivery were up 6/32 at
98 25/32 to yield 9.81%. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
9.5% securities were up 5/ 32 at 98 1/8 and Fannie Mae 9.5%
securities were up 5/32 at 98 5/8.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Securities
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of three casinos operated by real estate
developer Donald Trump rose on news that Mr. Trump's secured
$20 million in temporary financing just in time to enable him
to meet a midnight deadline on $43 million in bond payments.
   Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% first mortgage bonds ended
at 58, up 2 points from Monday. Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.
14% bonds closed at 50 1/4, up 1 point, while Trump Plaza
Funding Inc.'s 12 7/8% bonds finished at 84, up 2 points.
   Before today, Donald Trump had already repurchased nearly
$23 million of his Trump Castle 13.75% first mortgage bonds
to meet sinking fund payments on the issue.
   According to a June 15 filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Mr. Trump and his partnership purchased
about $22.7 million principal amount of Trump Castle's 13.75%
bonds before June 15. The filing said the purchase may be
applied against the $22.7 million principal payment that was
due June 15.
   The $43 million in debt payments that Trump owes includes
the almost $23 million required for the sinking fund payment
on the Trump Castle 13.75% bond issue.
   Junk bond dealers said trading in the Trump bonds was
modest yesterday, with most of the buying spurred by dealers
seeking to cover short positions. Many dealers had been
shorting Trump bonds and driving down the prices by betting
that Mr. Trump would default on the bonds.
   Despite the positive news, junk bond traders said the
spread between the bid and offered prices remains wide,
suggesting that the market is still uncertain about the
casinos' future.
   In the broader market, most junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, finished between 1/4 and 1/2 point
lower. By comparison, high-grade corporate bonds gained 1/8
point on average.
   Meanwhile, in the new-issue market for investment-grade
corporate debt, Dayton-Hudson Corp. offered $400 million in
debt securities. The two-part issue consisted of $200 million
of 12-year notes priced to yield 9.75% and $200 million of
30-year debentures priced to yield 9.98%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 15/32,
up from 101 31/32 on Monday. The latest ten-year notes ended
at a price of 102 5/32 to yield 8.53% compared with 101 25/32
to yield 8.58%.
   Short-term rates were slightly higher when compared with
the average rates set at Monday's Treasury bill auction. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.80%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.05% while the rate on
six-month bills ended at about 7.70% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.10%.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated July 2 and mature June 30, 1992.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Canadian bond prices rose sharply in moderate trading as
institutional investors piled back into the market on the
heels of a sharply higher Canadian dollar.
   Traders said participants regained confidence in Canada
after bond prices and the Canadian dollar failed Monday to
show significant negative reaction to the weekend demise of
the Meech Lake constitutional accord.
   "Investors are putting the political developments aside,"
for now "and are starting to focus on the Canadian economy
again," said Alberto Franco, head of the Canadian government
trading desk at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Mr. Franco said there is a growing perception among
investors that the Canadian dollar is strong enough to
provide room for the Bank of Canada to ease short-term
interest rates without weakening the value of the Canadian
currency. That's good for bonds, of course, because falling
interest rates lead to higher bond prices.
   Traders said the 10-year benchmark 10.5% Canadian bond due
July 2000 rose 1 1/8 point yesterday to close at 98 5/8 to
yield 10.72%.
   The Meech Lake accord, designed to meet Quebec's demand
that it be considered a "distinct society" and to defuse
independence forces within the mostly French-speaking
province, died after two provinces failed to ratify it by a
Saturday deadline.
   "There is some political risk (remaining because of the
failure of Meech Lake). But I guess people have realized they
overestimated the political risk," said Dan Aitchison, a
trader at Citibank Canada. "A lot of people were shorting
Canada expecting the worst."
   Elsewhere:
   -- British government bonds, called gilts, recovered from
earlier declines as sterling rose to a nine-month high. Among
benchmarks, the 11.75% bond due 2003/ 2007 rose 1/2 point to
103 19/32 to yield 11.21% while the 12% notes due 1995 rose
6/32 to 100 17/32 to yield 11.85%. On foreign exchanges, the
pound was quoted late in London at $1.7360, up from $1.7315.
   -- The West German bond market was pulled higher on the
strength of the U.S. and British bond markets. Bonn's 8.75%
bond due 2000 rose 0.39 point to 100.35 to yield 8.69%.

   Tax-exempt issues ended steady to 1/8 point higher in
light dealings.
   In new issue activity, market participants are expecting a
repricing of $785 million New York State Dormitory Authority
City University System consolidated second general resolution
revenue bonds to lower yields because of the strong investor
interest shown in the deal.
   As preliminarily priced, the New York State Dormitory
Authority bonds were priced to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to
7.65% in 2016.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged at 97 5/8
to yield 7.39% pc.
