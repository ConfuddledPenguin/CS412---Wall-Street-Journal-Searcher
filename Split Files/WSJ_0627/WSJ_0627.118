   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., which has been struggling
to restructure its finances to avoid bankruptcy-law
proceedings, said it is negotiating to sell its Business
Services unit.
   Western Union said a sale of the unit, which includes its
telex, telegram and electronic mail businesses, is contingent
on a restructuring of its debt.

   The telecommunications and financial services company has
been promoting its EasyLink electronic mail service as the
next-generation replacement for its dying telex business, the
source of most of its current problems. The possible sale
would leave Western Union with a Financial Services unit,
which includes its core money transfer and telegram
businesses.
   The company, which can't meet debt payments from current
cash flow, has said it may have to file for bankruptcy
protection if it can't restructure its debt. Western Union
said it hopes to complete such a restucturing by mid-July.
   Western Union failed on June 15 to make interest payments
on $530 million of 19 1/4% senior secured extendable reset
notes due 1992 and senior unsecured 16% notes due 1991.
   Business Services posted revenues of $303 million and an
operating profit of $72 million in 1989. It has 1,300
employees.
