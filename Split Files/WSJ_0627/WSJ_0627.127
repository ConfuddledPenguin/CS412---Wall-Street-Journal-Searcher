   Limits on Medicine
   Found Hard on Elderly

   WHEN MEDICAID officials in New Hampshire adopted measures
to limit prescription purchases, drug costs went down. But
admissions to both nursing homes and hospitals for elderly
patients went up.
   For 11 months in the early 1980s, New Hampshire limited
Medicaid recipients of all ages to three prescriptions per
month. Researchers at Harvard Medical School found that the
cap was particularly hard on elderly people with such
problems as diabetes, heart disease and asthma who often take
several different pills to control symptoms.
   The research -- reported last week at the annual meeting
of the Association for Health Services Research -- compared
about 440 New Hampshire patients with 1,532 Medicaid
recipients in New Jersey, where there wasn't any cap on
prescriptions.
   Preliminary results showed "a twofold increase in the rate
of admission to nursing homes" among the New Hampshire group,
Stephen B. Soumerai, principal investigator on the study,
told the meeting, held outside Washington. The
hospitalization rate was lower than that, but still higher
than in New Jersey, he said. Risk of admission to nursing
homes and hospitals was nearly identical in both states
before the cap was imposed and after it was replaced with a
less restrictive policy.
   Nursing homes were exempt from New Hampshire's drug cap,
and some admissions likely resulted when doctors referred
patients so they could get their drugs, Mr. Soumerai
reasoned. But some nursing home admissions and most hospital
stays probably reflected worsening health for patients who
couldn't get their medicines, he said.
   Researchers haven't formally analyzed the cost impact, but
the findings suggest the savings from reduced drug costs were
probably wiped out by the increased institutional care. Said
Diane Rowland, a Johns Hopkins University health policy
researcher: "It's a great example of a . . . policy that is
penny-wise and pound-foolish."
                                                                                                       

   Death of Rural Hospitals
   Isn't Medicare's Fault
                                                                                                       

   ABOUT 130 rural hospitals closed between 1987 and 1989,
and many hospital officials blame insufficient Medicare
payments for helping to undermine the facilities. But a new
study by the General Accounting Office asserts that, except
for the smallest hospitals, Medicare isn't driving rural
facilities to the graveyard.
   Hospitals suffering losses on Medicare patients had
comparable losses on patients whose care was paid by other
sources, Marsha Lillie-Blanton, a health policy analyst for
the GAO, said at the health-services research meeting.
Instead, small hospitals with low occupancy were at higher
risk of closing irrespective of Medicare reimbursement.
For-profit rural hospitals were eight times more likely to
close than their nonprofit counterparts, she said.
   Peter Snow, vice president, Southwest Community Health
Services, an Albuquerque, N.M., owner of 10 not-for-profit
facilities, disputes some of the GAO's findings. For one
procedure, he says, Medicare pays $1,000 more per patient for
an urban hospital in Albuquerque than it does for the same
procedure in rural Valencia, N.M.
   The company decided to convert the Valencia facility to
primary care and transport acute cases to the city 35 miles
away. But it will subsidize a more remote hospital facing the
same Medicare payment disadvantage to ensure access for its
rural constituency. By capping rural hospital payments,
"Medicare is trying to force the hospitals to become more
efficient," Mr. Snow says. "Let's at least acknowledge that
it is {also} putting those hospitals at risk."
                                                                                                       

   Care Rarely Vanishes
   When Facilities Close
                                                                                                       

   WHEN HOSPITALS do close, is the local population at risk?
To address the question, American Hospital Association
researchers checked with ambulance services in communities
where hospitals had closed in 1989.
   On average, the survey showed that in rural areas, another
hospital was open within 18.2 miles of a facility that
closed; in cities, an open hospital was within 3.4 miles. In
38 of 41 rural closings, ambulance drivers were within 30
minutes of an open hospital, the survey said.
   Hospital proximity is just one measure of access to care,
the researchers cautioned. Still, the results suggest that in
most cases, closing a hospital didn't deprive consumers of
care.
   The survey, part of a broader study of market factors
affecting hospital closings, suggests that competition is
driving some hospitals to shut down, says Simonetti Samuels,
senior economist at the American Hospital Association. "To
some extent, that closure is a healthy process. Some
{industry} downsizing is necessary."
   But consolidation in the hospital industry is expected to
accelerate over the next few years. Ms. Samuels and her
colleagues wonder whether that will leave the nation with a
shortage of beds just as an aging population demands more
services. "The next round of closings may look very
different," she says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE attended the health-services meeting,
up from 750 last year and 550 in 1987. . . . U.S. outlays for
the lead federal agency for health-services research soared
to $99 million this fiscal year from $50 million a year ago,
reflecting burgeoning interest in investigating the
effectiveness of the U.S. health-care system.
