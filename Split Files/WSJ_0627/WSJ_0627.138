   NEW YORK -- The Soviet Union has invited the New York
Stock Exchange to organize a seminar on the development of
securities exchanges.
   The seminar, to be held in Moscow in October, will be
jointly sponsored with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Finance and
Gosbank, the state bank.

   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister and State Economic Reform
Commission Chairman Leonid Abalkin invited the Big Board
chairman and chief executive officer, John J. Phelan Jr., to
lead a delegation of U.S. financial experts. Mr. Abalkin
called the initiative a "concrete step" toward the
development of a securities market in the Soviet Union.
   The invitation follows a suggestion first made by
President Bush to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at their
Malta meeting in December 1989. In the intervening months,
there have been discussions between Soviet government
officials and the New York Stock Exchange concerning the
scope, timing and administrative details of such a seminar.
   The Soviet government recently authorized creation of
public companies with the right to sell shares and issue
bonds.
