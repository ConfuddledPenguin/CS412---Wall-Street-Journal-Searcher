   NEW YORK -- Short interest among larger over-the-counter
stocks rose for the first time since March, posting a 4.5%
increase in the month ended June 15.
   Short interest among smaller OTC stocks rebounded 21.2%,
reclaiming much of a 25.9% drop in May.

   International Lease Finance Corp., which on Monday said it
agreed to be acquired by American International Group Inc.
for $1.3 billion in stock and cash, was among the stocks with
the largest short positions, with nearly 2.4 million shares
sold short, up from 2.1 million a month earlier.
   First Executive Corp., a Los Angeles life insurance
company that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds,
retained its lead with a short position of 9.4 million
shares, 967,000 fewer than in mid-May.
   The short interest in Intel Corp. surged 62.1% to 4.3
million shares, catapulting the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor concern into second place among the companies
with the largest short positions. One OTC trader suggested
the increase may reflect an arbitrage opportunity. In early
June, Intel said it was accelerating the expiration of its
1992 warrants to expire on July 25. Each warrant entitles the
holder to purchase 1.5 Intel common shares at $45 for each
warrant exercised.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at lower prices for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   NASD reported that short interest in 2,349 National Market
System issues, the largest OTC stocks, rose to 258.4 million
shares at mid-June from 247.2 million in mid-May among 2,327
issues.
   Short interest in 1,263 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq jumped to 37.5 million shares for June from 30.9
million in May among 1,265 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-June fell to 2.20 from 2.57 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues eased to 0.83 from
0.87 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.
   The adjacent tables show the National Market System issues
in which a short position of at least 50,000 shares existed
at June 15 or in which the short position had changed by at
least 25,000 shares from mid-May (see accompanying tables --
WSJ June 27, 1990).
