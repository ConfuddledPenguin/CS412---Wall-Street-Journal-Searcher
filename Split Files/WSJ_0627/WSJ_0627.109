   Aequitron Medical Inc., which Monday recalled thousands of
its infant-monitoring devices, is currently being
investigated by the Food and Drug Administration for
allegedly failing to notify the agency about baby deaths and
injuries as well as monitor malfunctions.
   The FDA inquiry into the Plymouth, Minn., company is a
continuation of an investigation started by the inspector
general of the federal Department of Health and Human
Services.

   "We're looking into failure to report under the
medical-device reporting requirements" in the agency's
regulations, said John Feldman, the FDA's district director
in Minneapolis. "If the failure was accidental, it would be a
civil matter. If there is intent to not report, that could be
criminal."
   Monday, for the second time in two years, the company said
it is recalling infant-monitoring devices to fix faulty alarm
systems. The machines, designed to be used in the homes of
high-risk babies, are supposed to sound an alarm when an
infant stops breathing, or if the monitor detects irregular
heart rate or respiration.
   The cause of the current recall seems to be that
electro-magnetic emissions can interfere with the monitor. A
company "safety alert" sent to parents last week warned them
to place the monitor and the baby "several feet away from
electrical devices such as televisions, nursery monitor
intercoms, oscillating fans and humidifiers."
   The agency didn't disclose how many deaths and injuries it
was investigating, but in January, the agency wrote to the
company about "numerous reports of deaths and malfunctions
associated with the models 8200 and 9200 and their alleged
failure to alarm during use."
   In October 1988, the agency criticized the company for
failing to disclose four deaths, four serious injuries and
two malfunctions.
   Company spokesman David Neuger said Aequitron agrees it
should have disclosed six of those cases. The failure to do
so, he said, "was just an oversight." Since last November,
the concern has reported all deaths or serious injuries
associated with the machine in any way, Mr. Neuger said,
though Aequitron denies any connection between those
tragedies and the machine.
