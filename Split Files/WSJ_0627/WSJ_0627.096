   NEW YORK -- At long last, the mark benefited from
anticipation of German monetary union this Sunday. After
trying to talk up the mark for weeks, foreign-exchange
dealers began to buy up marks yesterday, breathing new life
into the West German currency and smothering the dollar.
   "A lot of people have been bullish on Europe and the mark
for some time, and the market just decided to stand out of
the way and and let it go up," said David Wilson, a New York
vice president with Girozentrale Vienna.

   The Canadian dollar appreciated along with other
non-dollar currencies. The announcement that two members of
parliament from Quebec would quit the ruling Conservative
Party over the failure of the Meech Lake accord and sit
instead as independents was generally ignored by the
foreign-exchange market, said William Orsini, senior manager
for treasury markets with Bank of Montreal.
   The U.S. dollar ended in New York at 1.1712 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1773 Canadian dollars Monday.
   The mark's rise was by no means a sharp one. But traders
saw significance in way the West German currency took control
of the day's foreign-exchange market, seizing a dominance
analysts have been predicting for it ever since the formation
of a greater Germany became a certainty around the turn of
the year.
   The market ascribed less importance to the direction the
mark moved. Participants were uncertain whether the mark's
gain yesterday was a thin session's fluke or the start of a
bullish trend.
   "All this is surprising in the runup to German monetary
union, when we could have expected a softer Deutsche mark,"
said Andy Robertson, Chase Manhattan's corporate
foreign-exchange sales manager. "It's too early to tell if
this is the longterm direction."
   "We're currently operating in a vacuum," Mr. Robertson
said, noting that this week is the last in the month and
quarter, normally a down time for economic indicators and
customer orders.
   In addition, market participants still want to study the
consequences of shipping and wiring 25 billion marks,
according to one estimate, into East Germany in the next few
weeks. They also are awaiting the start on Monday of the
Soviet Communist Party conference and the U.S.'s credit
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
   Both get-togethers are expected to see some lively debate.
Communist Party hard-liners will attempt to snatch off Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's second hat as Party General
Secretary. Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger has signaled
her intention to push for easier U.S. credit terms.
   The mark's gains were registered in an atmosphere of
dollar weakness and encouraged selling of the U.S. unit
against other currencies, including the feeble yen.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6630 marks, well below 1.6770 marks late Monday in New
York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 154.67
yen, down from 155.35 yen in New York late Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.35 yen; it closed Tuesday in Tokyo at 155.23 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6642
marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6814 marks.
   Market concerns Tuesday that U.S. interest rates are
heading lower were sparked by comments by President Bush.
Emerging from meetings with congressional leaders on the
federal budget deficit, Mr. Bush backed off of his
"read-my-lips" election campaign pledge for no new taxes and
said he would consider "tax revenue increases."
   The currency market at first responded favorably to the
news, but upon mulling the comment over decided that, in the
short- to medium-term, a real presidential change of heart on
higher taxes will likely mean lower U.S. interest rates.
   About two weeks ago, responding to political pressure for
easier credit, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan promised that
interest rates would fall "very significantly" were a
credible federal budget deficit reduction accord reached.
   The prospect of easier credit undercut the U.S. currency
the most against the strong West German unit, because lower
U.S. interest rates would swing the relative currency-yield
advantage to the mark, said Bill English, senior trader for
Banca Nazionale Dell Agricoltura.
   The Fed committee would probably wait for the July 6
release of June employment data before acting on rates.
   Mr. Bush's comment pushed the dollar to 1.6730 marks,
where preset sell orders pushed the dollar easily through
weak support at 1.6700 marks. The greenback bounced back at
1.6650 marks but later fell further.
   The dollar's weakness allowed an otherwise soft yen to
regain some ground on it. After remaining steady most of the
day against the Japanese currency in the face of declines
against other major currencies, the U.S. unit was finally
pushed off the 155-yen plateau during the early New York
afternoon, and its yen price declined until the end of the
global day.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $3.40 to settle at $350.40 an ounce.
Estimated volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $350.10 an
ounce.
