   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Intelogic Trace Inc., a struggling
computer-service concern controlled by former corporate
raider Asher B. Edelman, said its board has taken the company
off the auction block.
   Intelogic, which had been on the market since late last
year, said the board decided management's "significant
operating improvements" and its plan to buy back debt
"enhance the value of the company above that which could be
realized through sale of the company at this time."

   Specifically, Intelogic has been moving actively to reduce
its investments in a risk arbitrage fund controlled by Mr.
Edelman and use the proceeds to buy back some of the $100
million face amount of junk bonds it issued through Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1986.
   So far this year, the company has repurchased nearly $20
million face amount of debt at a hefty 60% discount, said
Clark R. Mandigo, president.
   Intelogic, which was spun off from Datapoint Corp., a
computer networking concern also controlled by Mr. Edelman,
now plans to focus on growing the business internally and
through acquisitions, Mr. Mandigo said. The company said it
retained Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which had previously been
seeking buyers, to assist it in its acquisition efforts.
