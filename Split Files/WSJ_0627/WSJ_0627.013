   Donald Trump's bankers agreed in principle on a five-year
$65 million bailout plan for the developer, and lent him $20
million immediately so he could meet a midnight deadline on a
$43 million bond payment.
   The 30-day bridge loan, made by Mr. Trump's major banks,
also will give the banks time to complete the paperwork on
the bailout agreement. Under terms of the accord, the $20
million bridge loan must be repaid before Mr. Trump would
receive the $65 million.

   News of the bridge loan boosted the junk bonds of three
casinos operated by Mr. Trump
   With his acceptance of the banks' plan, Mr. Trump now
embarks on what will almost certainly be a long and difficult
restructuring of his empire.
   Under the rescue plan, the banks would suspend interest
payments on about $800 million of Mr. Trump's $2 billion in
bank debt. But he would continue to have to pay interest on
his $1.3 billion in bond debt, as well as on all or part of
his mortgages on the Trump Tower, Trump Shuttle, Plaza Hotel
and Grand Hyatt properties.
   The agreement would also exact wrenching changes in the
way Mr. Trump does business and could require him to live
much more modestly than has been his practice. In addition to
being kept on a strict personal budget, he probably would be
required to appoint a chief financial officer and to replace
some top executives.
   One person now being considered by Mr. Trump for a top
executive position is Victor Palmieri, a so-called workout
specialist whose relationship with Mr. Trump dates back to
the 1970s. Such people specialize in restructuring crippled
companies.
   "People will be retained according to how much money they
can bring in," said one banker involved in the negotiations.
   The commercial banks have also explored retaining an
investment bank to monitor Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City,
N.J., casinos, and they already are pushing for major asset
sales. In effect, said more than one banker, Mr. Trump will
experience the equivalent of a bankruptcy-law restructuring
without involving a bankruptcy judge.
   "I want to thank all of my banks and lending institutions
for making this complex and highly technical agreement
possible," Mr. Trump said in a statement. "I have gained a
great and deep respect for the banking system and those who
make it work."
   The immediate effect of the deal was to enable Mr. Trump
to make his $43 million payment of principal and interest on
Trump's Castle casino bonds. If he had failed to make the
payment, bondholders could have foreclosed on the property.
   In fact, one person familiar with the negotiations said,
Mr. Trump already is in technical default on a number of bank
loans because yesterday's bond payment was 10 days late.
Covenants in a number of his bank loans require that Mr.
Trump remain current on all of his obligations. However,
because Mr. Trump is in the midst of a restructuring, those
defaults are not expected to have a major impact on his
banking relationships.
   While the $20 million bridge loan was anticipated,
yesterday's action was still filled with high drama, as a
number of banks that had agreed to the deal appeared to waver
at midday. The money was not wired to the bond trustee until
5:30 p.m., said one participant in the negotiations.
   Even as Mr. Trump spent from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. signing
document after document in the law offices of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represents Bankers Trust Corp.,
bankers were scurrying to get the final approvals from
recalcitrant banks.
   Three banks, units of Bank of New England, First National
Bank of Chicago and Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.,
eventually agreed to the deal. It is unclear whether the
three banks will renew their opposition after the Trump's
Castle bond payment is made and the banks start tackling the
mountains of additional paperwork.
   The most notable holdout, West Germany-based Dresdner
Bank, still has not agreed to the proposal, but after
insisting all lenders had to be on board, a person involved
in the negotiations said the deal could get done without
Dresdner.
   Mr. Trump's statement expressed confidence that the final
proposal would be approved. "This agreement allows the Trump
Organization to go strongly forward and reflects and confirms
the inherent long-term value of our assets including Trump
Tower, the Plaza Hotel, the Atlantic City hotels and the
Trump Shuttle," Mr. Trump said in his statement. "The
agreement demonstrates the confidence of the banking group in
the company's ability to maximize the value of those assets."
   The $20 million was supplied by seven of Mr. Trump's major
creditors. Units of Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Citicorp, First Fidelity Bancorp, Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
and National Westminster PLC provided $3 million each;
Midlantic supplied $2 million.
   Bankers said they hope to have the paperwork for the $65
million loan completed within 30 days, but they have given
themselves two 30-day extensions in case it is not completed.
Presumably, there are provisions for extending the loan as
well.
   After the final deal is signed, said one banker, "the real
work begins for Donald."
   That work will involve improving on some of the
unprofitable deals Mr. Trump embarked on in the past two
years. Purchases of such unprofitable assets as the Trump
Shuttle and Plaza Hotel were made within the past two years,
when Mr. Trump enjoyed the status of a celebrity mogul, whose
name added value to his properties.
   Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, market forces beyond his
control tightened his access to capital at the precise time
he realized a cash shortage. His well-publicized marital
troubles focused unwanted attention on him, and his
successful attempt to have a critical casino analyst fired
also was interpreted by some bankers as a sign that he could
be under financial strain.
   Finally, the banks were tipped to potential trouble in the
Trump empire in April when he disclosed that he had attempted
either to refinance or sell almost every one of his major
assets, including the Trump Shuttle. The carrier has incurred
losses of almost $100 million since Mr. Turmp purchased it
last year. The airline's president, Bruce Nobles, said the
Shuttle has yet to receive any offers from potential
purchasers.
