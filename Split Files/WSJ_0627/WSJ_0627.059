   NEW YORK -- Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American
Airlines parent AMR Corp., sold nearly one-fifth of his
holdings of the company's stock early this month.
   Mr. Crandall sold 6,250 AMR shares at $65.25 each, or a
total of $407,812, filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission show. Those sales left him with 26,000 shares.

   A spokeswoman for AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, called
the sale "a personal decision by Mr. Crandall" and wouldn't
comment further.
   AMR closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading at $62.875, down 50 cents. Analysts recently lowered
their second-quarter earnings forecasts for the airline,
according to Zacks Investment Research. The second-quarter
consensus for AMR fell to $1.90 a share from $2.06 a share
about a month ago, Zacks said.
   Mr. Crandall "would have made a little bit more money (by
selling) last year," said Timothy Pettee, an analyst for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. AMR stock was selling for about $105 last
year after Donald Trump disclosed that he owned some shares,
which he later sold.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Pettee said AMR is "building a
tremendous amount of longterm value and gaining market share
at a rather precipitous rate." He said American, which
recently acquired Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines
and is seeking to expand in the Far East, is growing at
nearly twice the rate of the rest of the airline industry by
some measures.
                                                                                                       

   SELLING HIGH-TECH: Executives at a number of technology
companies have been selling stock in recent weeks.
   The companies include Conner Peripherals Inc., Octel
Communications Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Silicon Valley
Group Inc. and Control Data Corp.
   Robert G. Herwick, an analyst with Hambricht &amp; Quist,
noted that stock options are often a significant part of
compensation packages at technology companies and executives
would be likely to sell when they can get a good price.
"Valuation of technology stocks has improved somewhat over
the last year," he said.
   In many cases, prices have risen since the executives
sold.
   The largest sale listed on the accompanying table was by
Finis Conner, chairman and chief executive officer of Conner
Peripherals, a San Jose, Calif., computer and data processing
firm. According to filings with the SEC, Mr. Conner sold
150,000 shares for nearly $3 million in early May. The sale
accounted for only 6% of his holdings, however; he still
holds more than two million shares.
   Mr. Conner couldn't be reached to comment. SEC filings
show that he sold the shares at $19.50 to $19.75 each; the
stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $25.25,
up 12.5 cents.
   At Octel Communications, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of
voice processing systems, the chief executive and several
vice presidents sold shares for $22.88 to $24.50 apiece. The
stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $24.75, down $1.25.
   The president and chief executive, Robert Cohn, sold
61,000 shares for about $1.4 million. He holds about 319,000
shares. None of the Octel executives could be reached, and a
company spokesman wouldn't comment.
   A spokeswoman at Control Data in Minneapolis said two vice
presidents sold for personal reasons. Both sales were just a
portion of their holdings. At Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto,
Calif., a spokesman said shares sold by three vice presidents
were part of their incentive compensation, adding that the
sales were for personal reasons. The three sold less than
half of their holdings.
   William Egan, a director of Silicon Valley Group, sold his
entire holding of 145,375 shares for $1.5 million. Mr. Egan,
who is general partner in the Boston venture capital firm of
Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co., said the shares were held on
behalf of several venture capital funds that were reaching
the end of their terms. "The company was doing well, and we
thought it was a good time" to sell, Mr. Egan said.
   The stock gained 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $13 in
OTC trading, compared with the $10 to $11.50 a share that Mr.
Egan received when he sold. Silicon Valley is a maker of
chip-making equipment.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER CHAIRMAN SELLS: John Masefield, chairman of
Isomedix Inc., sold 55,000 shares for $653,425 in May and
early this month. Filings with the SEC show that the sales
leave him with 139,750 shares and 76,510 warrants.
   Mr. Masefield couldn't be reached, and another official of
the Whippany, N.J., maker of medical equipment wouldn't
comment.
   The chairman would have done better to wait. Although he
sold at $11.75 to $12 a share, well above the 52-week low of
$8.13, the stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $13.25,
down 12.5 cents.
