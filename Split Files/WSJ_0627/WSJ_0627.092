   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration for the first time
urged Congress to allow telephone companies to provide
cable-television service.
   In a letter to key lawmakers, the administration also said
it strongly opposes cable-television reregulation. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and James Rill, head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, said the
administration is "particularly concerned" about regulation
of rates for a basic tier of service consisting of broadcast
stations and requirements that cable companies sell their
programming to competitors such as direct broadcast satellite
services.

   In letters to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.),
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee,
Messrs. Mosbacher and Rill said the administration is also
concerned that the cable measures don't do much to remove
barriers that make it difficult for new competitors to enter
the cable business. The two suggested that Congress should
lift the ban contained in the 1984 Cable Act.
   The letters were sent yesterday, a day before Mr. Markey's
subcommittee is scheduled to mark up a bill to regulate basic
cable rates and stimulate competition to monopoly cable
operators. While the letters give support to phone companies,
their effect on legislation is unclear. With so little time
left on the congressional calendar, Congress is unlikely to
pass any legislation allowing phone companies to enter the
cable business this year.
   Meantime, Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is expected this
week to introduce a bill that would allow independent
telephone companies to enter the cable business within their
service territories.
   The measure, offered as an amendment to the cable bill
that passed the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this month,
wouldn't do much to help the regional Bell companies, which
are barred from providing cable and other information
services under the consent decree that broke up the Bell
system.
