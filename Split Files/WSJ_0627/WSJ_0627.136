   MANDELA ASKED Congress to help in bringing democracy to
South Africa.
   In a historic speech, the anti-apartheid leader asked a
joint session of Congress to support financially efforts of
the African National Congress in South Africa. "Our country,
which continues to bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy,"
he said. Mandela, ANC deputy president, thanked Congress for
its sanctions legislation and said he was encouraged to know
that U.S. lawmakers and the Bush administration agree that
sanctions should stay in place. But he urged them to "go
further and assist us with the material resources" needed to
promote the peace process.

Congress already has approved $42 million to assist efforts
toward democracy in South Africa.

   Lithuania's premier told parliament that breaking away
from Moscow would be impossible without a compromise with the
Kremlin, and asked the Supreme Council to freeze its
independence declaration. Prunskiene said Soviet leader
Gorbachev agreed that, in return for temporary suspension of
the declaration, he would end an embargo.

for the meeting were continuing.

   The Vatican ruled out public dissent by theologians,
striking at those challenging papal authority and the

told theologians to uphold its moral teaching or remain
quiet.

   EC leaders agreed to design a major Soviet aid program.

President Mitterrand.

consideration. Gov. Roemer has vowed to veto it.
