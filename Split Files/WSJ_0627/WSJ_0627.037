   INDIANAPOLIS -- Ipalco Enterprises Inc. said its board
approved a shareholder rights plan designed to protect
against "coercive" takeover tactics.
   The utility holding concern said the plan wasn't adopted
in response to any specific effort to gain control of the
company, "and we are not aware of any such attempt."

   Under the plan, shareholders will on July 11 be issued
rights that, in the event of an unwanted takeover attempt,
under certain circumstances will allow them to buy stock in
the company at half-price.
