   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner
Bank AG have sewn up their plans to divide the bulk of East
Germany's retail banking system between them, securing a big
lead in the rush for Germany's new market after monetary and
economic union.
   In separate agreements with East Germany's new Deutsche
Kreditbank AG, West Germany's two largest banks found a way
around East Germany's ban on takeovers of state-owned
industry. Though soon to be abolished, the restriction
limiting investment stakes to 49% hampered plans to complete
the bank acquisitions in time for monetary union on Sunday.
Kreditbank comprises the former retail operations of the
Staatsbank banking monopoly.

   Deutsche Bank is expected to announce today a
joint-venture agreement with Kreditbank that will give it
control over 122 Kreditbank branches, effective Sunday.
Deutsche Bank will take a 49% stake in the venture, which
will be called Deutsche Bank-Kreditbank AG and based in East
Berlin, Deutsche Bank officials said. Kreditbank will hold a
47% interest in the venture. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said
the remaining 4% is to be held temporarily by a group of East
German companies, which is expected to sell their combined
stake to Deutsche Bank once East Germany's majority-ownership
restrictions fall away after Germany's economic merger.
   The system of temporarily parking the crucial stake with
East German companies was the key to the agreement. It
guarantees the West German bank's majority stake while also
providing those East German firms with the promise of a
useful cash reward later on.
   Along with 18 East German branches acquired separately,
Deutsche Bank will have 140 retail outlets operating after
monetary union, with more to be added later. (East German
banks will be open Sunday to act as the official conversion
points for East Germany's changeover from the feeble East
German mark to the West German mark.)
   In a similar arrangement, Dresdner Bank yesterday said it
signed its own joint venture pact with Kreditbank that gives
it control over 72 of Kreditbank's retail outlets. Dresdner
Bank will take a 49% stake in the Dresden-based joint
venture, to be called Dresdner Bank Kreditbank AG, with the
East German bank retaining 47%. Three East German industry
groups, including VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, will hold the
remaining 4% stake.
   Dresdner Bank's 72 Kreditbank branches will be added to
the 35 branches of its own established in East Germany this
year. Dredner plans to have more than 150 branches in East
Germany by the end of 1991.
