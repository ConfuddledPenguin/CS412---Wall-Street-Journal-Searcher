   CHICAGO -- Faced with record losses, the airline industry
is attempting to push through a second round of fare
increases since the Middle East conflict raised the cost of
jet fuel.
   If the latest fare increases stick, the public's cost of
flying will have jumped roughly 10% since Iraq invaded
oil-rich Kuwait Aug. 2.

   Friday, a number of U.S. carriers began signaling that
they want to raise domestic fares starting Oct. 1. AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines unit, Continental Airlines, USAir
Group Inc. and America West Airlines said Friday they plan to
raise fares 4.2%.
   NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines has indicated it is
interested in going along with a second round of fare hikes.
While United Airlines hasn't disclosed what strategy it plans
to take, executives at the UAL Corp. unit don't believe fares
have increased enough to cover ballooning jet fuel costs, a
source said.
   As a result of the first fare increase, which amounted to
5.3% on Aug. 30, the cheapest round-trip fare between New
York and Chicago rose to $284 from $270. That fare will
increase to $296 if the airlines' new plan takes effect in
two weeks.
   The airline industry has scrambled to figure out ways to
handle the surge in jet fuel prices. So far, some carriers
have put a freeze on hiring, laid off thousands and reduced
flight schedules. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are
slashing earnings projections.
   Although this second round of fare increases didn't gain
momentum until Friday, it started quietly two weeks ago. Pan
American World Airways laid plans to raise its fares 4.4%
starting Sept. 18. That prompted Alaska Air Group Inc. to
plan a 4.7% increase as of Oct. 1.
   Thursday, Delta Air Lines executives decided on a 4.2%
increase. Eastern Airlines matched the move while Pan Am
postponed its increase until Oct. 1. Eastern and Continental
are units of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., formerly
Texas Air Corp.
   The carriers would probably drop their plans if a major
player doesn't participate. Airlines rarely raise fares
unless all of their rivals indicate that they are doing the
same. In this case, airline executives seem to agree that
higher ticket prices are needed to offset their higher fuel
expenses.
   Most are reporting that the price of aviation fuel, the
industry's second-largest expense, has risen 30 cents a
gallon since the invasion to about 90 cents from 60 cents.
Industry experts predict airlines will post record losses for
the year ending in December. Economists and Wall Street
analysts are calculating that the industry will generate a
net loss of at least $1 billion.
   The sudden squeeze on major airlines is also beginning to
chill smaller carriers. Late last week, WestAir Holding Inc.,
a United commuter, said it is furloughing 74 pilots and axing
money-losing routes in the Northwest and California.
   In addition to raising domestic fares, U.S. carriers are
also lobbying the government to permit them to raise overseas
fares by 6% to 10%. Unlike domestic fares, international
ticket prices are regulated by bilateral agreements.
   Last Friday, analysts at the U.S. Transportation
Department's international rates and fares division gave
their secret recommendation to high-ranking department
officials. Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary for policy and
international affairs, will study the staff recommendation
and make a final decision.
   The industry's effort to raise international passenger and
cargo fares was hammered out about two weeks ago in meetings
between U.S. and foreign members of the International Air
Transport Association, an industry group.
   The Transportation Department is also weighing a
little-known proposal by airlines to pass on to consumers the
cost of higher insurance rates prompted by the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait. This applies mostly to airlines that fly to the
Middle East. The trade group IATA wants to tag a so-called
war-risk surcharge onto fares. Carriers also want the power
to decide the length and amount of the surcharge.
   Although details of the staff opinion aren't available,
department insiders say that Transportation Department
Secretary Samuel Skinner is sympathetic to the reasoning of
the airlines. A decision is expected as early as this week.
   A few governments have already indicated their support for
the international fare increases. For example, Israel is
allowing its national carrier, El Al, to raise its overseas
fares by 10%.
   Amid rising fares and over-capacity, some airlines are
turning to short-term promotions to court customers who don't
have to travel for business. Northwest, for instance, is
sending its frequent flier members "Endless Summer" coupons
that let them travel round trip in the continental U.S. for
$169 if they book seven days in advance and comply with
certain rules such as staying over a Saturday night. These
fares must be bought by Oct. 1, the same day the higher fares
kick in.
