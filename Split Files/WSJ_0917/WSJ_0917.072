   As a European working in the U.S. materials industry, I
have often conducted spirited coffee-break debates on the
appropriate spelling of the 13th element. Imagine my delight
at finding the logical European spelling, aluminium, in your
report on FMC Corp. (Aug. 16, Money &amp; Investing). Picture,
then, my confusion at your reporter's reversion to the
unfounded American spelling, aluminum, in the next clause of
the same sentence.
   I am concerned that your august and influential
publication cannot determine a spelling policy for such an
important material. Please, in the American vernacular, get
with the program . . . er, programme.
