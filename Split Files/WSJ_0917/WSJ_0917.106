   NEW YORK -- Dutch electronics giant N.V. Philips, under
pressure to boost its sagging financial performance, plans to
leave its joint venture with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., according to people close to the venture.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said reports last week of Philips's
pullout in the Dutch press "are pure speculation at this
point." But sources close to the Hilversum, Netherlands-based
venture, AT&amp;T Network Systems International, said Philips
will announce that it is selling its 15% stake in the company
within the next two weeks.

   In Eindhoven, the Netherlands, a Philips spokesman
declined to comment.
   Meanwhile, Telefonica de Espana S.A. , Spain's national
telecommunications company, has announced plans to take a 6%
stake in the venture, which builds telephone exchanges and
transmission gear for public telephone companies.
   Telefonica will pay for its stake by swapping the 20%
interest it now holds in another AT&amp;T venture, AT&amp;T
Microelectronica Espana, which designs and builds electronic
devices.
   AT&amp;T currently owns 59% of AT&amp;T Network Systems
International while Italy's Stet Group owns 20%. After the
Philips pullout, AT&amp;T will own 74% of the company, although
it is expected to continue to seek European partners.
   AT&amp;T Network Systems International is AT&amp;T's primary
overseas equipment arm. It employs more than 5,000 people and
develops, manufactures and markets the 5ESS digital switch
and assorted transmission gear to foreign phone companies.
Sales in 1989 rose 10% to $600 million while profit jumped
58% to $15 million.
   "Philips's pullout wouldn't be surprising," said Charles
Nichols II, telecommunications analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "AT&amp;T had hoped that Philips's presence in
electronics would give it an entre into new markets, but
Philips didn't have a big telecommunications presence in
Europe, so AT&amp;T had to go it alone. Plus, Philips is a
financial disaster right now," he added.
   Mr. Nichols said AT&amp;T will probably pay "$60 million to
$90 million max," or no more than one times revenue, for
Philips's remaining 15% stake. He said AT&amp;T remains
well-positioned against European competitors since Italy and
Spain, its major partners, are also two of Europe's
fastest-growing telecommunications markets, with combined
plans to spend more than $30 billion over the next five years
to modernize their phone networks.
   Philips is narrowing its focus to improve its performance.
Because of heavy restructuring costs, the Dutch company
expects a loss of about $1.1 billion for 1990.
   The sale of its stake in the joint venture wouldn't
involve Philips's other telecommunications operations, which
include making office switchboards, mobile phone equipment
and modems. But some analysts believe Philips eventually may
sell its entire telecommunications business, which employs
about 15,000 people.
   The partners, in any case, had drifted apart with AT&amp;T
having taken over most of the management of the venture more
than two years ago. Philips cut its stake to 40% from 50% in
1987 and last year cut it again to 15%, saying it wanted to
focus future investment on its core businesses.
   The venture, originally called AT&amp;T-Philips
Telecommunications, was announced with great fanfare in 1983.
But Western European politicians quickly warned that the
linkup between one of Europe's biggest electronics companies
and mighty AT&amp;T would have a disastrous impact on
competitors.
   However, although the joint venture has proved moderately
successful, competitors such as France's Alcatel N.V.,
Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and West Germany's Siemens
AG have more than held their own.
   On Friday, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen and Telefonica
Chairman Candido Velazquez opened a new AT&amp;T Network Systems
plant to build 5ESS switches, in Tres Cantos, Spain, about 10
miles north of Madrid.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said it "will take the plant about a
year to get up to speed," by which time it is expected to
employ about 900 people.
