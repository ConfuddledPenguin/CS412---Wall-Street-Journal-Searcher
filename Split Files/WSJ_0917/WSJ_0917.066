   The U.S. is picking up important new military and
financial commitments from other countries in the campaign to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait, partly because of a major Iraqi
miscalculation that brought France more strongly into the
military equation.
   At the same time, President Bush directly warned the Iraqi
people that war might be the result of the showdown with
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In a taped message to Iraq,
aired last night on Iraqi TV, Mr. Bush declared that Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait had put the nation "on the brink of war."

   Mr. Bush added: "Perhaps your leaders do not appreciate
the strength of the forces united against them. Let me say
clearly there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately, Iraq must
withdraw from Kuwait. No one -- not the American people, not
this president -- wants war. But there are times when a
country, when all countries who value the principles of
sovereignty and independence, must stand against aggression."
   Even as the military preparations and talk of military
action accelerated, though, Bush administration officials
involved in managing the crisis now believe that it will be
November at the earliest before Saddam Hussein begins to
consider withdrawing from Kuwait, even if the trade embargo
against Iraq and diplomatic pressure work well. And it could
be December before that goal can be achieved through economic
and diplomatic pressure, they believe.
   The current U.S. strategy is to refrain from a military
assault as long as the sanctions keep working -- even after
U.S. military forces reach full strength in November.
   But officials concede privately that any signs of wavering
on the embargo, or of willingness to compromise -- such as
Iran's recent verbal attacks on the U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia -- could slow the process, as Saddam Hussein probes
for any fissures in the international effort that he can
exploit. The longer the standoff stretches out, the harder it
will be to hold together the sprawling anti-Iraq coalition.
   Thus, the U.S., France and the U.S.S.R. are discussing new
United Nations sanctions to punish countries that break the
embargo, especially by air. Presumably, these nations would
face some of the sanctions that have been issued against
Iraq. One possible penalty would be suspension of landing
rights for their national airlines. The ambassadors of the
five permanent U.N. Security Council members met yesterday to
begin shaping further resolutions, and U.S. officials said
there might be U.N. action as early this week to slap
penalties on embargo-busters.
   In just the past few days, five countries agreed to new
military deployments to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region to
join more than 100,000 American soldiers and sailors already
there. And others have pledged billions of dollars in funds
for the effort.
   France, enraged after Iraqi troops broke into one of its
buildings in Kuwait and seized diplomats Friday, agreed to
add a 4,000-man light-armored brigade with aircraft to its
forces in the Gulf. U.S. officials were puzzled by the Iraqi
moves against the French diplomats, and others from Belgium,
Canada and the Netherlands, which they regard as a major
miscalculation that only bolstered the anti-Iraq coalition.
   The fallout from the raids on diplomatic premises is
becoming more widespread. The U.N. Security Council yesterday
unanimously condemned the incursions, the Soviet Union
criticized them and Italy expelled some employees of the
Iraqi embassy there.
   In moves that were in the works even before the Iraqi
moves against diplomatic buildings in Kuwait, Britain said it
would dispatch a 6,000-man armored brigade and a third
squadron of fighter jets to the Persian Gulf. Canada and
Italy each announced the deployment to the Gulf of their
first jet fighter squadrons. Egypt said it is ready to send
up to two divisions of ground troops and Syria has pledged a
division of at least 10,000 men with roughly 300 tanks.
   In addition to the political importance of the French and
British decision to send additional forces, U.S. military
officials also welcomed the moves for more practical reasons.
Delays by Syria and Egypt in sending promised tanks and
soldiers have concerned U.S. commanders for several weeks,
and they hope to use European forces to plug certain holes in
the defensive barrier in northern Saudi Arabia.
   West Germany, while not sending combat forces, is handing
over to the U.S. about $1 billion of new military gear,
including military vehicles, 60 special tanks equipped to
resist chemical and nuclear attack, combat-support and
communications equipment.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also pledged about $1
billion in support for Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, bringing the
German total to $2 billion. The European Community is also
expected to announce shortly a financial commitment
approaching $2 billion.
   Mr. Kohl said "I regret very much" that Germany's
constitution doesn't permit it to send troops to the Gulf. He
pledged to try to change that law in early 1991, after
Germany is reunited and has held elections.
   "The buildup is still going on. It's going on for the
purposes the president described," said Brent Scowcroft,
President Bush's national security adviser, on CBS News's
"Face the Nation" yesterday. He added: "We want {Saddam
Hussein} to know we are serious."
   In addition, Secretary of State James Baker claimed that
all eight Arab and European governments he called on during a
10-day, 24,000-mile search for support that ended over the
weekend had signed onto the hard-line U.S. stand. That
posture rules out any compromise with Iraq on the U.N.
resolutions that demand unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait
and restoration of the Kuwaiti government that was ousted by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   "We talked about the preference for a peaceful and
political solution," an exhausted Mr. Baker told reporters in
Bonn, West Germany, the final stop on his tour. "But we have
to understand from the very beginning what we mean by that.
We do not mean walking away from, watering down, or in any
way diminishing the scope and extent of the United Nations
Security Council Resolutions. So, a sine qua non is that Iraq
withdraw, and that the legitimate government of Kuwait be
restored."
   Since Sept. 5, Mr. Baker has crisscrossed three continents
to meet with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Egypt,
Syria, the Soviet Union, Italy, West Germany, North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the EC, as well as the exiled Kuwaiti
leadership.
   The developments left the administration feeling upbeat.
But political criticism at home could still cause the White
House trouble. For one thing, all the new military forces
being sent by other countries are relatively small, leaving
the U.S. still the major country at risk there.
   Also, it's becoming clearer that the administration,
distracted by European and Soviet matters, wasn't tough on
Iraq until after the invasion, and may have missed a chance
to help head it off.
   In particular, a transcript of a crucial meeting that
April Glaspie, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, held with Saddam
Hussein just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait indicates
that she failed to clearly warn Iraq that the U.S. would
strongly oppose an invasion. The transcript was released by
Iraq, but U.S. officials haven't questioned its accuracy.
   But at a news conference in Bonn Saturday night, Mr. Baker
refused to discuss the Glaspie affair, citing the
confidentiality of diplomatic communications.
   Instead, he lashed out at critics of her performance,
calling her "a dedicated public servant who has done a fine
job" and saying it is "ludicrous to somehow suggest that the
United States contributed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait."
   In his address to the Iraqi people, meanwhile, Mr. Bush
attempted to place the blame for current high tensions
securely on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein, quoting back the
Iraqi leader's own words from a 1988 speech in which he
declared that no Arab nation had the right to occupy another.
In that speech, the Iraqi leader also declared that "if Iraq
should become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm
another Arab state, the Arabs would be right to deploy their
armies to check it."
   Mr. Bush said that war isn't "inevitable," but added that
"when conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earth
with greater resolve or stronger steadiness of purpose."
   Iraqi TV followed Mr. Bush's speech with a longer
commentary of its own saying that many of Mr. Bush's remarks
about the evolution of the current crisis were lies and that
he wants to be "dictator of the whole world."
