   PARIS -- France's Finance Ministry, searching for a way to
hold down inflation figures, decided not to raise tobacco
prices, which were scheduled to increase 3%.
   The increase was part of a broad anti-smoking campaign
under which prices were set to go up another 15% sometime
next year.

<TEXT>
   The tobacco monopoly still will get a wholesale-price
boost, but not till Jan. 1. But that day the government also
will cut the value-added tax on cigarettes, neatly offsetting
the wholesale boost. So consumer prices won't change.
