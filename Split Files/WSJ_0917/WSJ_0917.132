   Recognition Equipment Inc., Dallas, said it reached an
out-of-court settlement in the civil lawsuit filed by Paul
Carlin, former U.S. postmaster general. Recognition agreed to
pay an undisclosed amount in return for the release of all
claims against the company and its former officers.
   Carlin filed the suit in May 1989 against Recognition and
two former company officers. The suit was based on
allegations relating to a 1988 indictment that accused the
company and two of its top officers with attempting to
manipulate the award of $400 million in U.S. Postal Service
contracts. In November 1989, a federal judge acquitted all
defendants in the case against Recognition.
