   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Adobe Systems Inc. reported
higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings, but its
stock still slipped.
   For the fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 31, the software
company reported net income of $10 million, or 45 cents a
share, about 10% higher than the year-earlier $9.1 million,
or 41 cents a share. Revenue jumped 43% to $42.8 million from
$30 million.

   Earnings topped average Wall Street estimates of 40 cents
a share. Nonetheless, in national over-the-counter trading
Friday, Adobe tumbled $1.25 to $26.875 on volume of more than
1.3 million shares.
   The results included a special $3 million royalty payment
from a major customer, without which Adobe earnings would
have been a nickel a share or so lower, analysts estimated.
   Bruce Lupatkin, a technology analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist
in San Francisco, said some investors may be concerned that
Adobe is experiencing "margin pressures." He added: "I think
those fears are misplaced. But that is the nature of the
market" for technology stocks, which have been hammered
routinely in recent months at any hint of weakening
operations.
   For the fiscal nine months, Adobe said earnings rose 18%
to $28 million, or $1.28 a share, from $23.7 million, or
$1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 38% to
$115.4 million from $83.7 million.
   Adobe said Apple Computer Inc., its largest customer,
accounted for 21% of total revenue in the latest third
quarter. Earlier this month, the two companies entered into a
"new and expanded" technology agreement, assuaging some
investor fears that the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker was
losing its appetite for Adobe products. Adobe develops and
sells programs that create images and type fonts on desktop
computer screens and printers.
