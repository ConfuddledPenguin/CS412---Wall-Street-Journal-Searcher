   TOKYO -- Japan's auto workers, complaining about too much
overtime, want the industry to stretch out its four-year
cycle for introducing new car models.
   Japanese auto makers say the unions haven't approached
them directly on the issue, but some are nervous anyway. "One
of the advantages of Japanese auto makers in the global
competition is the speed of development," said a Honda Motor
Co. official, adding that Japan's "competitive edge might be
dulled" if the cycle is lengthened. In Europe and the U.S.,
the cycle runs six to eight years, industry officials say.

   Teruhito Tokumoto, president of the Confederation of Japan
Automobile Workers' Union, Japan's biggest auto industry
labor group, recently proposed a review of the four-year
cycle, citing a new government policy to reduce average
annual working hours to below 1,800 by 1992. Workers in the
auto industry averaged 2,275 hours last year, the Labor
Ministry says, more than any other manufacturing sector.
   An analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co. says the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry might have approached Toyota
Motor Corp., the leading Japanese auto maker, about
shortening hours. Some industry officials support the idea,
because fierce competition may already have shortened the
car-model cycle to less than four years.
