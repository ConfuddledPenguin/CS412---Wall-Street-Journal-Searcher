   WASHINGTON -- House-Senate conferees, in their first major
accord on differing clean-air bills, agreed to toughen
controls on industrial sources of smog.
   The Senate conferees largely accepted the stronger
language of the House bill, which would bolster the federal
government's authority to force states and cities to clean up
smog. The Environmental Protection Agency would be required
to impose clean-up plans on cities that failed to come up
with them on their own. The EPA also would impose sanctions
on cities that didn't make good-faith efforts to comply with
their plans.

   At the same time, cities would have more time than under
current law to devise clean-up strategies. Smoggier cities
would be required to take harsher steps than cleaner ones,
including applying controls to smaller polluters such as dry
cleaners and bakeries.
   The conference also reached a compromise on new permit
requirements for major sources of pollution. Again, the
stringency of the regulation would depend on the severity of
an area's air pollution.
   Small-business groups had lobbied vigorously over the
provisions, and the latest accord was reached after conferees
agreed to require states to provide technical assistance for
smaller concerns affected by the bill's requirements.
   Several lawmakers expressed hope that reaching these
agreements would add momentum to what has been a slow-moving
conference process. In the 3 1/2 months since the House and
Senate completed work on their bills, the conferees had
agreed only on provisions designed to phase out the
production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that
are used in refrigeration and insulation but that harm the
protective stratospheric ozone layer.
   These chemicals generally would be phased out more rapidly
than required under international agreements the U.S. has
signed. The conference plans to take up provisions dealing
with motor vehicles next.
