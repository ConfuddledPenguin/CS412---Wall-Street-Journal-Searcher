   LOS ANGELES -- Weintraub Entertainment Group, one of the
last of the high-flying, hard-falling independent
entertainment companies of the 1980s, said it filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.
   The action was taken after two banks couldn't reach
agreement with closely held WEG and bondholders about
disposition of the company's assets. Some bondholders then
threatened to file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.

   Flamboyant company chairman Jerry Weintraub raised $461
million in 1986, including distribution deals and credit
lines. He was helped by an alliance with Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, a track record of producing such hits as "The
Karate Kid," a gift for salesmanship and a friendship with
then-Vice President George Bush. But Mr. Weintraub was later
criticized for running the company with lavish overhead and
showing poor judgment in picking motion pictures. Debt
burdens created by purchasing a film library compounded his
problems.
   The company released eight films, the highest-profile of
which was "My Stepmother Is an Alien." None were markedly
successful. Since the spring of 1989, WEG has released only
one movie -- its last in the pipeline -- and has been largely
operating on revenue generated by its film library, which it
bought from Cannon Group in 1987 for about $85 million and
has been trying to sell. The last results made public were
losses of $41.9 million in 1988. Meanwhile Mr. Weintraub and
company president Kenneth Kleinberg have been trying to find
new sources of money in Japan and elsewhere. Last year, they
hired former junk-bond king Michael Milken to help with the
rescue project.
   Bondholders said they were concerned that the secured
creditors, Credit Lyonnais Group's Dutch subsidiary and to a
lesser extent Bank of America, would take possession of
assets worth the approximately $85 million owed to them and
there'd be nothing left over for bondholders. The company and
bondholders hope the film library is an asset which will
appreciate if the company can continue to operate. The
library contains more than 1,700 films, many of them British,
28 television series and a number of classic newsreels.
   Through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., WEG placed about $81 million
in junk bonds, which paid 13% and were sold to institutions,
notably failed Miami, Fla.-based CenTrust Savings Bank, whose
chairman, David Paul, was a Weintraub director. The company
has missed two $5 million interest payments in recent months.
   A standstill agreement with the banks had helped allow WEG
to operate as long as it did, according to individuals close
to the negotiations. Employees have left the company in
droves since its heyday, and overhead has been cut. Mr.
Weintraub's initial contract called for a salary of $1.7
million a year. The banks were prepared to extend the
agreement, but only under terms unacceptable to bondholders,
and what one source described as "shuttle diplomacy" between
the two parties by the company was unsuccessful.
   According to individuals close to the situation, Credit
Lyonnais has the first security interest in the library and
Bank of America stands to take a loss on its loans.
   Sources also indicated that although majority shareholder
Mr. Weintraub would continue to be involved in the company,
he may step down as chairman. Discussions have occurred with
Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Brothers film unit, both on the
part of the company and Mr. Weintraub personally, but
executives wouldn't provide details.
