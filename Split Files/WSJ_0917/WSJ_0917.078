   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Producers of coal and
forest products in the province's rugged interior said
they'll be forced to halt operations soon unless a 13-day-old
strike by unionized rail workers ends.
   The walkout by 1,700 workers at provincially-owned B.C.
Rail Ltd. has crippled freight transport from dozens of pulp
and lumber mills along B.C. Rail's 980-mile main line and
halted shipments from two mines that jointly account for
about 40% of British Columbia's coal exports.

   There have been no negotiations since the walkout began
Sept. 4, and no new talks are planned between the company and
representatives of its seven unions. A meeting is set for
this morning, however, between the warring sides and British
Columbia's minister of labor, who is empowered to force
workers back to their jobs.
   "At the present time {the government} is not considering
intervention," a spokeswoman said late Friday.
   Meanwhile, Quintette Coal Ltd. said it will start reducing
output and temporarily lay off most of the 1,450 workers at
its northeast British Columbia mine beginning Thursday unless
the contract dispute is settled. "We simply have no way of
getting our product to market, and that means that we have no
source of revenue," said the company, which sells its coal to
Japanese steel producers.
   Teck Corp., which owns 61% of the neighboring Bullmoose
coal mine, hasn't yet said what its plans are.
   Weldwood of Canada Ltd., a big lumber and pulp producer,
sees an "imminent" round of shutdowns and layoffs at several
of its mills, some of which already cut output because of the
strike, said Thomas Buell, chairman and chief executive. "The
impact is substantial. We're getting to a point where we
don't know if we'll be able to continue operating," he said.
   Like Weldwood, other big forest products concerns that
rely heavily on B.C. Rail's line through central British
Columbia are using trucks, where possible, to haul freight to
Canadian National Railways' line, which interconnects with
B.C. Rail's system. The hardest-hit producers include Canfor
Corp., Slocan Forest Products Ltd., West Fraser Timber Co.
and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., among others.
   "It's certainly created a difficult situation," said a
spokesman for Canfor. A survey of 17 affected sawmills showed
production is down anywhere from 10% to 95%, said Greg
Jadrzyck, spokesman for the Council of Forest Industries of
B.C., a trade group.
   B.C. Rail, which is losing about 4.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$3.8 million) a week due to the strike according
Roger Clarke, vice president, finance, has been running
advertisements in Vancouver newspapers outlining its position
on the dispute. The ads said B.C. Rail's annual union payroll
would jump 60% to C$123 million if it satisfied all of its
unions' demands.
   The ads prominently display the 23.5% one-year wage boost
initially sought by union negotiators, along with other
demands. "That was an opening figure" only, said Clyde
Mulhall, chairman of the Council of Trade Unions of B.C.
Rail, which comprises the company's seven unions.
   "The main issue here is contracting out" work to nonunion
personnel, Mr. Mulhall said. "We've told the company and
everybody that. If they're prepared to negotiate contracting
out, then we'd revert back to a more realistic increase" in
wages.
   The unions' previous three-year contract with B.C. Rail
expired June 30.
