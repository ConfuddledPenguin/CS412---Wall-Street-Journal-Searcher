   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. launched a new round of
cost cuts, eliminating the jobs of four key executives and
offering cash incentives to 600 administrative staff
employees to leave their jobs.
   A spokesman said Sears is reviewing another 1,400
administrative jobs at its headquarters here and may offer
"reorganization incentives" to some of those employees.

   The steps signal that Chairman Edward A. Brennan is trying
to reduce costs this year as he had indicated when he took
day-to-day control of the faltering Sears merchandise group
last month. Just a year ago, Sears completed a massive
reorganization of the unit, but sales have been sluggish and
profits have fallen since then.
   Sears officials wouldn't comment on how much they expect
to save, but analysts said they don't expect the figure to be
substantial. Instead, the analysts viewed the moves as
largely symbolic. "I'm glad to see they understand their cost
problem is as much a management problem as anything else,"
said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities.
   The posts of two merchandising senior executive vice
presidents were eliminated and two other senior executives
retired and weren't replaced. In addition, two top
merchandising executives, Thomas E. Morris, 43, and Jerry A.
Hand, 50, resigned unexpectedly.
   The two executives whose jobs were cut, Matthew A. Howard
and Eric D. Saunders, aren't leaving Sears. They assumed the
responsibilities of Messrs. Morris and Hand, who had overseen
marketing and home fashions, respectively. Neither Mr. Morris
nor Mr. Hand could be reached for comment.
   Sears said only that the two men resigned to "pursue other
interests." But Mr. Brennan was understood to have carefully
reviewed all of the executives' performances, suggesting that
he was especially disappointed with the company's advertising
programs. Mr. Howard's new title, senior vice president of
marketing, also signals that Sears considers him more of a
heavyweight than Mr. Morris.
   Mr. Morris presided over last year's launch of Sears's
"everyday low pricing policy," which failed to stimulate
sales or reduce expenses, as expected. Moreover, the launch
was accompanied by an advertising blitz that some insiders
now acknowledge probably confused consumers. Sears touted the
program as "a sale that never ends."
   Mr. Morris's resignation comes at a time when three ad
agencies are understood to be putting together pitches for
the big Sears ad account. The Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit of WPP
Group PLC currently handles the account and has been assured
by Sears that it isn't conducting a review. The Sears
spokesman said Mr. Morris's departure doesn't signal a change
in agencies.
   The retiring executives are Con S. Massey, 53, senior vice
president for human resources and administration, and Vern L.
Page, 60, vice president for catalog merchandising.
   Sears said it is combining four of its merchandise group
and corporate headquarters administrative departments. They
are personnel, planning, law and public affairs. Now under
review are the company's finance departments and other
administrative functions.
   Managers who take the cash incentive will receive two
week's salary for every year of service. Non-managers will
get a week's salary for every year of service.
