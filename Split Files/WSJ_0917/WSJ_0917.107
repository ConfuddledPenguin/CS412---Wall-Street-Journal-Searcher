   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. lowered its estimate for overall
car and truck sales in 1990 amid growing gloom in the auto
industry about the state of the economy.
   Ford, which had forecast the U.S. market at 14.5 million
cars and trucks in 1990, dropped its estimate to 14.3 million
vehicles, said Harold A. Poling, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer.

   Until recently, the industry had been planning for
improved sales in the year's second half, but Mr. Poling said
that now appears unlikely. "We'll have weakness in the fourth
quarter, so we won't have the pickup we hoped for," he said.
He predicted the sluggish sales climate would continue into
1991, but that sales would pick up in the 1991 second half.
General Motors Corp., meanwhile, said it was sticking to its
prediction of 14.5 million vehicles. Chrysler Corp., which
put the market at 14 million to 14.5 million vehicles in
June, has no new forecast, either. But a top Chrysler
official echoed Mr. Poling's worries Friday.
   "A possible downturn in the economy" is a "big concern to
us all," said Robert S. Miller, Chrysler's vice chairman.
   Detroit has reason to brace for a rough period. The jump
in oil prices, resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
month, already seems to have had a chilling effect on the
U.S. economy. And there's evidence that is hurting car sales.
Overall sales of cars and trucks declined 17% in August from
a year earlier, although sales rebounded somewhat in the
first 10 days of September. The slow sales may translate into
production cuts by auto makers in the fourth quarter, which,
in turn, could drag down the national economy even further.
   When consumers "get nervous, they don't buy cars," said
John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "I think
Detroit is facing at least a year of decelerating sales."
