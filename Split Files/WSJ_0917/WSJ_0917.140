   WASHINGTON -- Rising oil prices are clearly taking a toll
on the economy, boosting inflation and crimping consumer
spending, new government figures indicate.
   Releasing its first data on the nation's inflation,
spending and production since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the government said producer prices soared 1.3% in
August, while retail sales dropped 0.6% and industrial output
slipped 0.2%.

   The figures bore out the fears of many analysts that the
surge in oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf turmoil
would threaten the already weak economy by pinching
Americans' purchasing power and piling a new burden on
businesses.
   An increasing number of economists now believe a recession
in the near future is inescapable. "Look at what happened in
August: employment declined, consumer spending declined,
industrial production declined," said Donald Ratajczak,
director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State
University. "At some point when it looks and smells and acts
like a duck, then what is it?"
   The jump in the Labor Department's producer price index,
which measures the prices factories, farmers and other
producers receive for goods, was fueled mostly by energy
prices, which catapulted 9.6% during the month. But even
excluding energy the index rose a substantial 0.5%, amounting
to a 6% annual rate.
   Gasoline prices leaped 16.9% while prices of home heating
oil soared 38.8%. Crude petroleum prices skyrocketed 62.5%,
the largest monthly increase ever recorded. That pushed up an
index measuring prices of unfinished goods a startling 9.3%
in August, the steepest rise since August 1973, when the
government ended a price freeze.
   Many economists believe the problems of inflation stemming
from the oil crisis are only beginning.
   "We know the inflation effect isn't over," said James
Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago,
predicting that it will take three or four months before the
jump in crude oil prices works its way through to the gas
pump, heating bill and other consumer energy costs. "So the
rest of the year is going to be dominated by the oil price
increase and feeding through to other products."
   Already, Mr. Ratajczak noted, makers of petroleum-based
chemical products have announced increases in the prices of
their products. Nevertheless, he and other analysts predicted
that many businesses will have a hard time passing higher
energy costs on to their customers, given the weak economy.
   Airlines are already finding that out. Many postponed
plans to raise fares to cover huge rises in their fuel bills
in the face of softening consumer demand.
   The drop in retail sales came despite a huge 6.4% rise in
the amount of money taken in by gasoline stations during the
month. While higher gasoline prices pushed up sales totals at
filling stations, business for most other types of merchants
declined. Sales of car dealers plummeted 4.3%.
Department-store sales slipped 0.2%. Hardware and
building-supply stores dropped 2.4%. Restaurant sales fell
0.7%. Sales of furniture stores increased, however, climbing
0.7%.
   "American consumers cut back sharply in August as their
confidence about economic conditions plunged," said Donald
Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New
York.
   The drop in industrial production last month reflected
small declines in the output of a wide array of industries,
including cars, computers and clothing. As a result, the
operating rates of factories, mines and utilities fell to
83.1% of capacity in August from 83.5% in July.
   The string of reports highlight the difficulty confronting
the Federal Reserve. The central bank is under pressure to
lower interest rates to jump-start the ailing economy. But
officials are wary of allowing rates to fall while inflation
remains a problem.
   Few analysts expect inflation to spiral out of control as
it did following the oil shock of the late 1970s. Global
competition is likely to force companies to keep a firm grip
on prices and wages, Mr. Annable predicted.
   Still, the oil price jolt "probably but not certainly will
push the economy over the edge into a mild recession," said
Charles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution
in Washington who was chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers during the Carter administration.
   Figures in all three reports were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
