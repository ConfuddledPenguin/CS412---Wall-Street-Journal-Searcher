   For a publication that seems to understand so well the
dangers of big government (e.g., "The Imperial Congress"),
you seem remarkably satisfied with the "war on drugs"
("Cracking the Drug Problem," Review &amp; Outlook, Aug. 13).
   As research scientists studying addiction, we are
concerned that this heavily funded and promoted "war on
drugs" is ignoring the most dangerous drugs, tobacco and
alcohol. As Americans weary of government draining our
resources with failed promises, we are sorry to see you
supporting another set of money-hungry, power-hungry
politicians and bureaucrats. Addiction is a
scientific/medical problem that cannot be solved by policemen
and prisons.
