   Your Aug. 10 article "Plaintiffs Strike a Blow for
Shifting Blame for Accidents Caused by Their Own Acts" was
interesting and informative.
   For several years legislative efforts have been made in a
number of states (including my state of Wisconsin) to enact
so-called "Common Knowledge Defense" laws. Reportedly, those
initiatives enjoyed the financial backing of the alcohol and
tobacco industries.

   Simply stated: If it's "common knowledge" that using a
product can be harmful and a person uses it anyway, the
person is negligent for his or her own safety and is barred
from suing the manufacturer. Without identifying it, the
"Shifting Blame" article covered the subject quite well.
   However, missing from it was the added element of whether
the product is addictive. In the case of alcohol and tobacco,
how important is the fact that children in this country --
from a very early age -- are subjected to daily
"glamorization" of harmful products in print, billboard,
scoreboard and electronic media ads. Is a sub-teenage child,
"hooked" on an addictive substance, responsible for possible
consequences that may be 20, 30 or 40 years in the future?
Where does the "blame" lie?
