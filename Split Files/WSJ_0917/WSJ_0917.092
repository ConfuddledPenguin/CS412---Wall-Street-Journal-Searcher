   WASHINGTON -- Although Senate confirmation hearings for
David Souter may last two or three more days, there appears
to be little doubt that the New Hampshire judge is poised to
take a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   But his deft testimony has caused senators, liberal and
conservative interest groups, and lawyers to wonder where he
will sit on the high court's spectrum of legal views.

   Based on his 10 hours of interrogation thus far, he
appears likely to fit in the court's ideological middle -- a
moderately conservative spot occupied most often by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   On at least two issues -- when the government must
accommodate religious practices and how to decide what rights
the guarantee of "due process" protects -- Judge Souter
rejected the views of the court's most ardent conservative,
Justice Antonin Scalia, and said he prefers the approach of
Justice O'Connor.
   This may upset some conservatives, who hope Judge Souter
will be a staunch ally for Justice Scalia and Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist. During questioning Friday, conservative
Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire seemed flustered when some of Judge Souter's
answers fell short of dogmatic conservative responses.
   Conservatives have been disappointed in the failure of a
solid majority to coalesce on issues such as abortion,
religious freedom and affirmative action. The court has moved
in a more conservative direction on these issues, usually by
5-4 margins, but the five-vote majority frequently has been
splintered, with Justice O'Connor and, sometimes, Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy and Byron R. White reaching the same
results but following different legal reasoning.
   The more solid four-vote liberal wing of Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, long led
by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., was sometimes able to take
advantage of conservative differences to secure a fifth vote
for a majority. Justice Brennan's retirement on July 20,
creating the vacancy for which Judge Souter was nominated,
will make it much tougher for the liberal wing to obtain a
majority.
   But the question remains whether the conservative majority
will become any more cohesive once Judge Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court justice who turned 51 years old
today, joins their ranks.
   It is difficult to predict the performance of Supreme
Court justices, since most justices say it takes them five
years to really learn the job and since some of their views
have changed once they were on the bench. Based on his own
testimony, however, Judge Souter shed some light on his
approach to a few important legal issues.
   Last April, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, the high
court ruled that Oregon may prohibit the use of the
hallucinogenic drug, peyote, by the Native American Church.
State laws that are applicable to everyone don't violate the
First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom, even when
they prohibit a religious ritual, Justice Scalia wrote,
saying the state needn't justify such interference.
   In a separate opinion, Justice O'Connor said Justice
Scalia's decision "dramatically departs" from
long-established First Amendment decisions that require the
state to have a strong justification for interfering with
religious practices.
   Judge Souter, although emphasizing that he wasn't making a
commitment, said he preferred Justice O'Connor's approach.
   In another instance, Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989
decision that the 14th Amendment guarantee of "due process"
protects those individual liberties that are rooted in
American history when examined only in the narrowest terms.
In a separate opinion, Justice O'Connor rejected such a
narrow role for history and tradition in defining civil
liberties. In his testimony on Friday, Judge Souter, too,
rejected such a narrow approach.
   In other developments in the hearings, which continue
today:
   -- Judge Souter said he would have an open mind with no
"agenda" on the question of whether to overrule Roe vs. Wade,
the 1973 decision that recognized the right to abortion.
   -- Abortion-rights groups announced their opposition to
him, since they want a nominee committed to upholding the
right.
   -- Judge Souter said affirmative action is necessary,
although he was careful not to commit himself in the
continuing debate over how far it may properly go. When
discrimination has been proven, he said, it isn't enough to
stop it. "The appropriate response is to say, `Undo it.'"
