   MOSCOW -- Tens of thousands gathered in central Moscow
yesterday evening demanding the resignation of Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov and his government and calling for direct
presidential elections.
   The demonstration was a show of strength for the fractured
political left, which called for a coalition of democratic
forces to replace the current government and to implement
radical economic changes that would lead to a market-based
economy.

   A string of politicians addressed the crowd from a high
balcony of the Moskva Hotel near Red Square. "We are in a
catastrophic situation in this country," said Sergei
Kavalyov, a member of the Russian parliament. "Our leadership
is not a leadership we elected, it's a leadership we
inherited."
   The crowd broke into frequent applause and shouts of
"Resignation] Down with Ryzhkov]" and held up placards with
slogans such as, "Communists] You wrecked the country and
robbed the people."
   (Separately, AP-Dow Jones News Service reported that Italy
agreed to give the beleaguered Soviet Union three trillion
lire ($2.56 billion) in extraordinary credits after Mr.
Gorbachev acknowledged his nation is in danger of bankruptcy.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis announced the
loans Saturday following his Kremlin meetings with Mr.
Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. On
Friday, Mr. Gorbachev described the Soviet international
economic position as "catastrophic." He also warned of
possible government insolvency on international markets. The
Soviet Union has been late paying its international bills,
and must cut its imports of medicine and consumer goods for
lack of hard currency.)
   Last night's demonstration wasn't huge by this year's
Moscow standards, but it occurred against a background of
political turmoil as the leadership struggles to select a
program for economic reform. At the core of the battle are
two programs -- one, a moderate reform proposal by the
Ryzhkov-led government, and the other a more radical program
drafted by a team led by Stanislav Shatalin and backed by
both Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and popular Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin.
   These two programs, and a compromise alternative that
makes some minor adjustments to the Shatalin plan, have been
sent to the parliaments of each republic and to the national
parliament. Last week, the Russian parliament passed the
Shatalin program, stepping up the pressure on Mr. Ryzhkov.
Mr. Yeltsin repeatedly has called for the prime minister to
resign.
   Mr. Gorbachev has so far hesitated to push his hand-picked
prime minister to resign, but he has said it might not be
effective to have Mr. Ryzhkov in charge of implementing a
program that he doesn't support. Last week, Mr. Ryzhkov
himself said that he cannot implement a program he doesn't
agree with.
   Details of the programs have trickled out over the past
weeks, but haven't been widely publicized in the Soviet
Union. Both programs say that a market economy is the only
way to help the Soviet Union out of its economic crisis. But
the programs differ in some fundamental ways.
   The Shatalin plan answers the growing passion for regional
sovereignty in the Soviet Union, stating that the central
government would exercise only those powers allowed it by the
15 republics. It would take 500 days to implement and would
start with fiscal austerity, widespread privatization and
decentralization of government. Free prices would be
introduced later. Mr. Ryzhkov argues that such a plan could
mean the end of statehood for a unified Soviet Union and will
lead to a steep drop in living standards. He advocates less
decentralization, more moderate de-monopolization, and
immediate price increases to be set by the government.
   Many people at last night's demonstration weren't exactly
clear on the contents of either plan, but they were sure that
they no longer trusted Mr. Ryzhkov's government to take any
action that would help them. Some hinted that the sudden
shortages of key items such as bread and cigarettes in Moscow
may have been orchestrated by anti-reformers determined to
stop perestroika. Such a conspiracy theory has been widely
discussed in Moscow in recent days.
