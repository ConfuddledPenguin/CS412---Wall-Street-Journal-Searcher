   Finding More Room
   For Ethics in Divorces

   DIVORCE lawyers are grappling with increasingly difficult
ethical dilemmas.
   As custody and financial battles between estranged spouses
grow more intense, divorce lawyers are wondering whether
putting up a good fight for their clients is always ethical.
The 1,200-member American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers is
drafting a code of ethics that will address such conundrums.
The group says it is making a special effort to address
obligations to children.
   Stephen Sessums, a Tampa, Fla., lawyer and chairman of the
committee drafting the code, says the "Rambo lawyer" who uses
"the legal arsenal to bludgeon the other side" may inflict
lasting damage on family relationships that must survive a
bitter divorce. "It is important to look for ways to reach a
compromise or decision or a result where everybody wins," he
says.
   Robert H. Aronson, an associate dean of the University of
Washington School of Law who is helping to draft the code,
says it will strongly encourage settlement or arbitration in
divorces.
   The code is also likely to suggest that lawyers consider
the best interests of children during divorce proceedings and
that they report incidents of child abuse or the possibility
of abuse to authorities, even if their client is the abuser,
says Mr. Aronson.
                                                                                                       

   And You Think There Are
   Too Many Practicing Law
                                                                                                       

   SOME LAWYERS say Scott Turow had the right idea.
   In the wake of the success of Mr. Turow's "Presumed
Innocent" and "The Burden of Proof," many lawyers have taken
to their word processors. Several have recently produced
crime novels, complete with allegedly true-to-life courtroom
scenes.
   Bantam Books just published "To Speak for the Dead," by
Paul Levine, a Miami lawyer. Mr. Levine, once a partner in
the Miami office of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, a law firm based
in Philadelphia, says he found "running around the country
defending asbestos cases . . . to be a less than personally
satisfying experience." He says his main character "reflects
some of my cynicism."
   For Jay Brandon's "Fade the Heat," published last month by
Pocket Books, an option on the movie rights has been
purchased by Steven Spielberg. Mr. Brandon, who wrote three
previous novels, just quit his job drafting opinions with the
Court of Appeals in San Antonio, Texas, and expects to devote
his time to writing and criminal defense work. The jacket of
his novel touts it as "a masterpiece of legal intrigue in the
best Scott Turow tradition."
   But despite the success of Mr. Turow, a partner in a
Chicago law firm, some publishers wish lawyers would stick to
practicing law. "All lawyers think that they can write
because they dictate interminably," says Howard Kaminsky,
president of Hearst Trade Book Group. "A lot more word
processors {are} being bought and a lot more lawyers {are}
writing novels," Mr. Kaminsky says, but "I don't look forward
to reading them."
                                                                                                       

   Large Firms Overcome
   Marketing Reticence
                                                                                                       

   BIG LAW FIRMS, which traditionally have eschewed
self-promotion, are making some bold marketing moves.
   The July issue of California Lawyer, a trade publication,
had a six-page color advertisement for Baker &amp; McKenzie,
which has 1,600 lawyers in 44 countries. A profile of the law
firm was accompanied by photos of lawyers and a world map
with Baker &amp; McKenzie's branches marked. The ad cost about
$35,000.
   "No law firm has ever done anything like that before,"
says Chet Holmes, California Lawyer's associate publisher.
"No law firm has ever run a profile of itself in any
publication."
   Timothy Tosta, a partner in the firm, says that although
some of his colleagues were reluctant to place the ad, it has
"brought us enormous recognition, which inevitably leads to
business."
   Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, a firm of about 400 lawyers
based in Cleveland, is trying a subtler approach. To mark its
centennial, it has underwritten the cost of an exhibit of
paintings by Winslow Homer at the Cleveland Museum of Art.
The show will travel to museums in Columbus, Ohio, and
Washington, D.C., where the law firm also has offices.
   Squire Sanders's donation was $450,000, payable over three
years. Museum and law firm spokesmen say they believe it is
the largest gift ever by a law firm to a cultural
institution.
   John F. Lewis, a Squire Sanders partner, says an early
partner of the firm was instrumental in founding the museum,
and the firm decided the gift was an appropriate way to say
"thank you to the community that gave birth to us and
nurtured us."
                                                                                                       

   California PAC Adopts
   A Higher Profile
                                                                                                       

   CALIFORNIA lawyers are becoming more aggressive in the
political arena about their professional interests.
   The California Lawyers Political Action Committee was
launched in 1988 to oppose legislation "that was anti-lawyer,
anti-consumer," says P. Terry Anderlini, the PAC's treasurer
and a former state bar group president. So far, it has
opposed a push for non-licensed legal technicians and fought
proposed changes in how judicial candidates are reviewed. The
PAC recently decided to hire a lobbyist and take positions on
legislation on legal issues.
   But that will take money, and so far the PAC has raised a
little over $30,000. "I don't find lawyers eager to give
money," says Luther Avery, a San Francisco lawyer who has
tried his hand at fund raising for the PAC. "It's a hard
sell. The automatic response {by} a lawyer to any question is
`No,' or `I'll think about it.'"
