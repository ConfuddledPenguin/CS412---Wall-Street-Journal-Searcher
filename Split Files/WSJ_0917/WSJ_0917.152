   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov is warning that the
Soviet Union will have to cut imports of medicine and
consumer goods sharply; there's no money to pay for them.
Tent cities are popping up in downtown Moscow, part protests,
part Gorbovilles. Rude inspectors at Soviet airports used to
meticulously examine currency exchange forms; now they often
don't bother -- Marlboros, not rubles, have become the
currency of choice. Black markets are taking over goods
distribution.
   In short, the downward spiral of the Soviet Union is
visible everywhere. One prominent Russian academic publicly
calls Gorbachev "our Hitler." That vicious description, while
unfair, reflects broad and deep-seated public bitterness.
Separate articles last week in the Moscow News and literary
Gazette discussed the possibility of a military coup against
the government to restore order.

   Mr. Gorbachev has followed through on an agreement he made
recently with Boris Yeltsin, throwing his weight behind the
free market reform plan of Stanislav Shatalin. Mr. Shatalin's
plan is a vast improvement on the timid plan written by Mr.
Ryzhkov, which Mr. Gorbachev had heretofore supported. But we
suspect that Mr. Gorbachev did not shift because be's been
spending his evenings reading Adam Smith. In his desperation,
he is willing to back any plan that might help him hold the
crumbling Soviet empire together.
   More important than what the Shatalin plan has to say
about privatization and price reform is the provision that
allows each republic to set its own economic policy. This is
what Mr. Yeltsin and the other republic heads wanted. The
Russian parliament endorsed the Shatalin plan 213-1. As long
as Mr. Gorbachev gives them what they want, they won't have
to set about destroying him. He and the central government
survive another day.
   Mr. Ryzhkov argued that giving the republics independent
economic policy would lead to disintegration. He's probably
right, Mr. Gorbachev can no longer afford to think of the
long term. Even the Shatalin plan has a time schedule of 500
days, an eternity for a system facing imminent collapse.
   Mr. Gorbahev may now be convinced that reform from the
center is impossible. After five years of power, he has shown
himself incapable of producing the necessary transformation.
There is an ineluctable momentum in the Soviet Union toward
decentralized authority. After 70 years of central control,
Soviet peoples want the reverse. This is not only happening
politically but in enterprises and institutions. It brings
disorder and redundancy, as Russians freely admit, but in a
sea of chaos people want control over their own little
islands.
   There simply is no longer an apparatus with the authority
to privatize property on an all-Union level. There is
certainly no authority sophisticated enough to carry out a
privatization scheme that meets various political goals, such
as social equity and fair distribution of property. The
republic governments, where many of the politicians of the
future are already in place, at least have a chance. But
privatization may eventually become simply an ad hoc process
carried out at local levels.
   The shift to the Shatalin plan should cause the West to
rethink its government-to-government transfer programs. If
republics are to become the major economic actors, Westerners
will have to make contacts at that level, and not with the
increasingly redundant central officials. Many in the West
have feared that contact with local officials would be seen
in Moscow as an effort to undermine Mr. Gorbachev. But now
that Mr. Gorbachev himself has signed on to the idea of local
economic independence, he has no grounds to object.
   There have been many Soviet five-year plans since the
Bolshevik revolution. The Shatalin plan may well be the final
economic plan with the word Soviet Union attached. Maybe this
will be the first one to work, or maybe the whirlpool toward
anarchy will swallow it up.
