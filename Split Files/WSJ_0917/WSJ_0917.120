   David Fine, president and chief executive, told analysts
that he expects "very satisfactory increases in net sales"
for the year.
   Chief Financial Officer Jan Cook said "we look forward to
a successful full year for PolyGram."
   The Dutch music firm saw its earnings decline in the first
half of 1990 as it absorbed the costs of assimilating and
integrating Island International Ltd. and A &amp; M Records Inc.
Both record companies were acquired by PolyGram in 1989.
PolyGram is 80%-owned by N.V. Philips
   Fine said the acquisitions will help boost U.S. sales --
an area the company has targeted for much of its future
growth. He added the company's dominance in Europe will give
it an advantage in exploiting a growing East European music
market.
