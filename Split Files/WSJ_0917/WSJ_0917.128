   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- As many as 3,000 Kuwaiti refugees
streamed into northern Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and
thousands more reportedly were heading for the border in
makeshift caravans after Iraq suddenly allowed free passage
for some residents from occupied Kuwait.
   The border crossing at Al Khafji, the traditional seaside
transit point between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, was reopened
without warning on Saturday and again early yesterday
morning, Saudi officials said. Some of the Kuwaiti refugees
said they rushed to the border after hearing broadcasts on
Voice of America that the gate had been opened.

   The flow of refugees had slowed to a trickle in the past
few weeks as Iraqi soldiers stepped up efforts to catch
Kuwaiti families fleeing across the desert. Saudi officials
said they expect the border crossing to be reopened at least
for part of today, though they haven't received any official
word.
   Yesterday's about-face by Iraq threatens to complicate the
situation for both the Saudi government and exiled Kuwaiti
leaders, especially if large numbers of refugees continue
pouring into the northeastern corner of this country.
Concerned about the potential for terrorists or spies to
infiltrate Saudi Arabia, military and government officials
quickly enacted procedures to carefully interrogate all the
refugees -- some of whom said their passport and other
identification papers were taken by Iraqi soldiers.
   Other refugees, according to Saudi officials, recounted
stories of Iraqi troops taking their jewelry, video equipment
and other valuables before allowing them to cross into Saudi
Arabia.
   Saudi officials said that thousands of vehicles from
Kuwait were headed toward the border yesterday evening, when
the Iraqis closed the border as quickly as they had opened it
more than 12 hours before.
   It's too early to tell whether Iraq's moves are part of a
broader strategy to try to gain international support, but
some Saudi officials are concerned that the outflow of people
could weaken the resistance movement in Kuwait.
   By allowing disaffected Kuwaitis to escape, this theory
goes, Saddam Hussein may be setting the stage to install more
of his people into key business posts and other jobs in the
occupied country. Moreover, Saudi officials fear that some of
the refugees could be entering to help provoke dissent among
Saudi Arabia's large Shiite minority, which fills many of the
jobs in the oil fields.
   Saudi border guards said that some of the Kuwaiti families
were allowed to leave, but their servants and other non-Arab
domestic helpers weren't allowed to cross into Saudi Arabia.
   Some 250,000 Kuwaiti refugees previously escaped to Saudi
Arabia, and taking care of another large influx could stress
Saudi facilities. "We simply don't know why the border is
suddenly open, or how long it will stay open," one senior
Saudi military official said. "But we are taking precautions
to protect ourselves."
