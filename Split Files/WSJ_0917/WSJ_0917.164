   The global scramble for cash is leaving the U.S. with a
foreign "investment gap" that analysts warn will lead to a
weaker dollar, higher U.S. interest rates and a slower
American economy.
   If first-half trends continue, foreigners will invest $40
billion in the U.S. by year-end, down 72% from the $141.7
billion of U.S. stocks, bonds and "real assets" -- real
estate and companies -- they added to their holdings last
year, according to Salomon Brothers Inc. At the same time,
American investors are purchasing assets abroad at an annual
rate of $62 billion, up 16% from the $53.6 billion they
bought in 1989.

   This investment gap already has contributed to the
dollar's decline. From its highest point in the past 12
months, the dollar has dropped 20% against the mark, 18%
against the pound and 14% against the yen. And it ominously
suggests the dollar will drop further.
   "The danger is that if the markets began to form the view
that the U.S. authorities are happy to let the dollar fall,
then the fall could easily turn into a rout," Mark Cliffe,
chief economist for Nomura Research Institute in London,
warned clients on Friday. A plunging dollar, he added, would
have "damaging implications . . . for U.S. financial
markets," including stocks and bonds.
   Analysts say the dollar's recent weakness indicates that
foreigners are still shying away from U.S. markets.
   In fact, long-term capital outflows (investments of a year
or more) from the U.S. currently exceed capital inflows. The
only other time this has happened since 1982 was during the
October 1987 global stock market crash, says Nicholas P.
Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers.
   A continuing dollar decline, he and other analysts add,
could keep U.S. interest rates from falling more than they
otherwise would, and possibly even push them higher. Higher
rates would, by themselves, tend to buoy the dollar. But they
would cause bond prices to fall, and if they slow the U.S.
economy into a recession, they probably would push down stock
prices, too.
   Foreigners have already become net sellers of U.S. stocks
after being net buyers last year; their net purchases of U.S.
bonds are off 48%, and their acquisitions of real assets are
down 71%. Meanwhile, Americans bought a record net $10.9
billion of foreign stocks and bonds in the second quarter.
And on an annual basis, their purchases of foreign bonds are
nearly four times last year's amount.
   If this trend persists, Salomon Brothers predicts that $22
billion of investment money will leave the U.S. this year,
compared with a 1989 net inflow of $88.1 billion. And
prospects for a reversal aren't good.
   "I don't see a quick turnaround to this pattern," says Mr.
Sargen. "With interest rates higher abroad, why would
foreigners want to keep buying U.S. bonds?" And while "the
dollar is cheap, our assets are unattractive to overseas
investors because our interest rates are too low and our
investment prospects stink."
   In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at
1.5710 marks and 136.95 yen, compared with 1.5677 marks and
136.20 yen late Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.8930
from $1.8825.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
136.53 yen, up from 136.52 yen at the close there Friday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5583
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.5695 marks.
   A weak dollar helps to lower the U.S. trade deficit by
reducing American export prices while making imports more
expensive. But it also exacerbates U.S. inflation, both
through the higher import prices and the opportunity they
offer U.S. manufacturers to boost domestic prices.
   Behind the foreigners' retreat from U.S. markets and the
growing appeal of foreign securities to Americans are rising
interest rates abroad, the expectation of lower U.S. rates, a
falling dollar and a softening U.S. economy.
   On a semi-annual compound yield basis, 10-year U.S.
Treasury bonds currently yield 8.85%. That compares with
11.81% for equivalent British bonds, 8.83% for West German
and 7.70% for Japanese bonds. On Friday, the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond set a new high for
the year.
   Yields abroad are even more attractive on an
inflation-adjusted basis. That's because inflation in West
Germany and Japan is about 3% compared with nearly 5% in the
U.S.
   "The narrowing of interest-rate differentials is making
domestic {Japanese} paper more attractive, especially
considering exchange-rate risks," says Michiya Matsukawa,
Tokyo-based chairman of Nikko Research Center Ltd. and a
former vice minister of finance. He adds that with higher
yields available at home, Japan's big life insurance
companies are finding it more profitable to lend domestically
rather than invest abroad. Indeed, in the first six months,
Japanese investors sold a net $8.9 billion of U.S. stocks and
bonds, according to the Ministry of Finance.
   Yet interest rates aren't the whole story. U.S. and
foreign investors have been drawn to European and smaller
Asian economies and stock markets. German companies, for
instance, began investing in East Germany and the rest of
Eastern Europe, once the countries were free of Communist
rule.
   The long-term investment gap is a serious problem for the
U.S. -- and the dollar -- because it means that foreigners
now must finance not only the U.S. current-account deficit,
but also the anticipated long-term capital outflows. The
current account includes trade in goods and services plus
certain financial transfers. The U.S. balance of payments
comprises the current account, plus long-term and short-term
capital flows (investments with maturities of less than one
year). By definition, the payments account must be in
balance, like a check book.
   For years, net foreign investment in the U.S. has helped
finance the current-account deficit. Last year, for example,
the $88.1 billion of long-term capital inflows reduced the
$110 billion current-account deficit to $21.9 billion. The
rest was financed by private short-term capital inflows,
commercial bank lending or foreign central banks.
   This year, however, the current-account deficit, which had
been shrinking, should widen again, mainly because of higher
oil imports. And because long-term capital inflows have in
fact become net outflows at an annual rate of $22 billion,
the gap that foreigners must finance becomes even wider.
   The question is how and at what cost that gap will be
financed, especially since nearly everyone predicts a weaker
dollar, which will further turn international investors away
from American markets.
   "We have a situation where the foreign official sector has
to make up the difference; or the dollar will have to come
down to a point where investors buy, either because they
think it has bottomed out or because U.S. real assets look so
cheap," says Robert T. McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank
Ltd. in New York. Noting that foreign official institutions
-- mostly central banks -- helped fill the gap in the second
quarter by buying a net $6 billion of U.S. government
securities, he expects them to continue buying. But not until
the dollar tumbles some more.
   David Horner, senior financial strategist at Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co., predicts that the dollar could fall to 1.42 marks and
132 yen in coming months. "I just don't see a case for the
dollar bouncing," he says. Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers
forecasts that in the first part of 1991, the U.S. currency
will be trading between 1.40 and 1.50 marks and could even
drop to the 120-130 yen range. That would put the dollar
below its post-World War II low of 1.5385 marks, set on Aug.
27, and near its record low of 120.25 yen, set on Jan. 5,
1988.
   "The wild card is the uncertainty surrounding the Mideast
crisis," says Mr. Sargen. He and others warn that if war
breaks out, the dollar could rebound as investors flee to it
as a haven.
   The dollar is vulnerable because the Federal Reserve is
expected to ease monetary policy shortly, either because of
an accord to reduce the budget deficit or to counter
recessionary trends in the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, many
analysts expect Germany and Japan to tighten monetary policy
to counter domestic inflationary pressures.
   "Japanese investors are incredulous that the Fed could
even be considering an easing move at a time when every other
major central bank is considering tightening," says David M.
Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a unit of
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. He adds that foreign investors
believe that the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond must
rise a full percentage point or more from its current 9%
level to be attractive.
   "The implication is that U.S. long-term rates must move
significantly higher to remain competitive for a limited
amount of global capital in the midst of a recession," says
Mr. Jones. He believes that with a slowing economy, domestic
U.S. investors will fill part of the gap, keeping long-term
rates at current levels. Still, he concedes, that will do
little to help revive the economy.
   "In the past, whenever the Fed eased in a recession,
long-term rates came down in line with short-term rates,"
says Mr. Jones. "But this time, they may not budge or
conceivably could even go higher."
   Mr. McGee of Tokai Bank expects foreign central banks to
step in. He notes that the finance ministers and central bank
heads of the seven major industrial countries are scheduled
to meet next weekend, and adds: "They are going to have to
reach agreement about under what conditions they would
seriously become buyers" of dollars to keep the currency from
plummeting. He believes central banks will intervene once the
dollar falls below 1.50 marks and 130 yen, which he expects
to occur before year-end.
   Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday,
gold for current delivery settled at $385.10 an ounce, up
$2.20. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$386.45 an ounce.
