   BRAINTREE, Mass. -- Massachusetts health officials
recommended against a planned hazardous waste incinerator in
a blow to Clean Harbors Inc.'s plans to build a $42 million
facility.
   In a nonbinding opinion, the Department of Public Health
said that the plan to build the facility in an industrial
area of heavily populated Braintree was unsuitable because of
concerns about respiratory problems for residents. The state
Secretary of Environmental Affairs is expected to rule on the
plant this week.

   William Geary, vice president of public affairs for Clean
Harbors, said company studies indicated "there wouldn't be
any adverse health impact." He said the state health
department hasn't set limits establishing an acceptable risk
level. He added the company might be able to alter its plan
to meet health department worries by limiting either the
volume or the types of waste incinerated.
   Clean Harbors is a hazardous waste hauler and cleans up
oil and toxic waste spills. It operates an incinerator for
medical wastes at the Braintree site. The hazardous waste
incinerator would be Clean Harbors' first such venture and
would be the first hazardous waste facility in Massachusetts,
one of the biggest exporters of hazardous wastes.
