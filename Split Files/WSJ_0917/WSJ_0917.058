   SAN FRANCISCO -- PLM International Inc., extending a
previously reported understanding, said that Transcisco
Industries Inc. agreed not to launch a proxy contest at the
PLM annual meeting Oct. 17, and that PLM would use its "best
efforts" to help Transcisco sell some or all of its 36% PLM
stake.
   The agreement essentially extends a year-old accord
between the two companies through next Jan. 10. Transcisco is
a railcar-maintenance company that was formerly known as PLM
Cos., from which PLM International, a transportation-leasing
company, was formed in 1988.
