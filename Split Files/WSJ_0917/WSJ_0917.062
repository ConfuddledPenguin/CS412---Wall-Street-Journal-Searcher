   On your Oct. 18, 1989, editorial page there was a
satirical article by former Secretary of the Navy John
Lehman, entitled "In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk." In it,
Mr. Lehman criticized President Reagan and Secretary of
Defense Weinberger for actions they took to better prepare us
to respond to Middle East contingencies such as establishing
the Rapid Deployment Force and placing stocks of ammunition
and equipment on pre-positioned ships in the Indian Ocean.
These preparations have been invaluable to our military
during the current Iraqi crisis. We could not have responded
as rapidly as we did without them.
   Mr. Lehman made the same mistake as many military leaders
in the 1980s. They were so focused on the Soviet Central
Europe threat that they failed to perceive the other
potential threats to our security. As a result, much of the
defense buildup in the past decade is oriented solely to a
Soviet threat and not of great value to us in the current
situation in the Middle East, such as submarines and nuclear
missiles.
