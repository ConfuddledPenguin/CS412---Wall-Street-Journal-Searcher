   TOKYO -- An intense debate is brewing here over whether
Japan should dispatch personnel to support multinational
military operations of the sort now aimed at Iraq.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in late August asked the
nation's powerful bureaucrats to draft legislation
authorizing the government to send unarmed personnel to
assist United Nations peacekeeping efforts in global trouble
spots.

   But government and political leaders are sharply divided
over the shape of the proposed law, which some regard as a
violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of Japan's
anti-war Constitution. The debate is certain to grow even
hotter when the Diet, or parliament, is called back into
session, probably in October.
   Many officials believe Japan must play a more active role
in international crises if it is to assume a place on the
diplomatic stage commensurate with its economic might. "We
are now working through a rather agonizing {stage} of
transforming ourselves into a really internationally
responsible power, ready to do whatever is appropriate as a
country of this economic size and influence," said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   The proposed law would provide for teams of Japanese
personnel to perform such noncombat functions as
communications and transport for the multinational forces
defending Saudi Arabia. But such issues as lines of command
and whether to include unarmed members of Japan's
Self-Defense Forces, as the army is euphemistically called,
touch a raw nerve in a nation that for 45 years has sought to
extinguish the painful legacy of militarism that led to World
War II.
   Underlying the government's "agony" is a strong current in
Japanese public opinion that foreigners may find difficult to
comprehend. "Generally speaking, I think the population is
very nervous about the military raising its head again," said
Yukihiko Ikeda, a member of parliament from the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, and son of a former prime minister.
   Japanese who grew up before and during the war recall that
the Japanese army made its own foreign policy in the 1930s.
Sidestepping the elected parliament, it declared itself the
army of the emperor and marched into China.
   Under the postwar Constitution, which renounces war, the
Japanese military has had little influence. In recent debates
over Japan's role in the Persian Gulf, for example, officials
of the Japan Defense Agency and the uniformed Self-Defense
Forces have been notable for their absence. Even to this day,
hardly any graduates of Japan's most prestigious universities
make a career in the uniformed services.
   Should the laws or the Constitution be changed to give the
military an overseas role, its influence in bureaucratic
debates and position in society would presumably increase. "I
really wonder if the Americans who are pushing for a Japanese
military presence in the Gulf know what they are doing," said
one Japanese banker who is in his 40s. Said a Japanese
journalist of about the same age: "Don't you have an
expression in English about Pandora's Box?"
   No one suggests that the military would again march off on
its own as it did during the 1930s. But even an increase in
bureaucratic power would be frightening.
   During the debates over Japan's role in the Persian Gulf,
which most recently resulted in Friday's decision to provide
an additional $3 billion to support United Nations sanctions
against Iraq, the Japanese have been treated again to the
unedifying spectacle of individual bureaucracies fighting for
their own institutional interests rather than for the
national good.
   The Finance Ministry, for example, has seemed much more
obsessed with protecting the budget than in contributing to
the Gulf effort. The ministry's power over the purse gives it
considerable influence over the measures Japan has announced.
Japan's government system lacks a strong central executive
capable of overriding powerful individual ministries.
   One senior government source said the proposed
peacekeeping law is unlikely to permit uniformed members of
the Self-Defense Forces to participate in military-related
overseas operations. But some leaders argue for a system
under which Self-Defense Forces could be assigned to
peacekeeping teams answerable directly to the Japanese
Cabinet. Others are lobbying for changes in the law
regulating the Self-Defense Forces, so its members could be
dispatched by the Defense Agency itself.
   In any case, the number of people authorized for the teams
is likely to number in the thousands, the government source
said.
   For now, Japan hopes that its $4 billion in assistance,
which includes $1 billion in aid previously pledged for the
multinational forces, will quiet complaints from the U.S. and
Europe that Japan isn't doing enough to help protect the flow
of oil from the Middle East.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost, who has publicly urged
Japan to provide more help to the U.S. in the Gulf, welcomed
the large increase in Japan's support package. "This decision
clearly demonstrates that Japan is a full partner in the
ongoing efforts of the international community to work toward
a just and peaceful resolution of the crisis," Mr. Armacost
said.
