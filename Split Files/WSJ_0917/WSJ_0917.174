   In another move to head off a possible union buy-out bid,
Greyhound Lines Inc. asked the federal judge hearing its
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy case to subordinate any
back-pay claims from striking Amalgamated Transit Union
members to the claims of all other creditors in the case.
   Greyhound made the request in a lawsuit filed with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Friday.
The suit alleges that the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound
Local Unions, the ATU bargaining unit, used violence in an
attempt to acquire the GLI Holding Co. unit at a price less
than fair market value or to drive it into bankruptcy.
Greyhound said the purpose of the suit was to "prevent the
union and its membership from profiting from their
misconduct."

   "I am appalled and amazed that they would have the
temerity to make such assertions," said ATU General Counsel
Earle Putnam. Union officials have repeatedly denied
responsibility for the widespread violence against the
company since the ATU strike began on March 2. Greyhound
blames the attacks for the losses that forced it to file for
Chapter 11 protection.
