   WPPSS defaulted in 1983 on $2.25 billion of bonds, the
largest default in municipal bond history. This will be its
third bond sale this year and will complete its high-coupon
refunding program involving $3.5 billion of bonds. The new
securities, whose maturities range from two years to 27
years, involve WPPSS units 1 and 2, which didn't default, and
are guaranteed by the Bonneville Power Administration, a
regional power agency of the Energy Department. Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. is senior manager.
