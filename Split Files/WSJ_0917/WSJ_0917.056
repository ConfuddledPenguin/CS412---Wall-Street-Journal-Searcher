   FRANCHISERS BANKROLL franchisees for expansion and faster
growth.
   When Connie Hart, operator of a temporary-services
franchise in Syracuse, N.Y., couldn't get banks to finance
her purchase of another temporary agency, her own franchiser,
Uniforce Temporary Personnel Inc., chipped in. The New Hyde
Park, N.Y., operator of temporary services agencies gave Ms.
Hart $40,000, about 50% of the acquisition price, without any
repayment required. This year, Uniforce gave Ms. Hart another
$40,000 for a second acquisition that boosted her franchise's
total revenue to $3.4 million.

   Uniforce, which receives 45% of the gross profits of its
franchisees, figures that the increase in Ms. Hart's revenue
and the economies of scale of running a larger agency has
more than paid back its $80,000 expenditure.
   "Putting the money in ourselves is a more economic
proposition," contends John Fanning, president of Uniforce.
"It allows for rapid growth and it doesn't saddle a
fast-growing franchisee with onerous debt." Uniforce spent
about $5 million on this financing program in the past 12
months and plans to double such expenditures in the year
ahead.
   Besides Uniforce, such franchisers as Jiffy Lube
International Inc., Baltimore, and Medicine Shoppe
International Inc., St. Louis, are directly funding the
expansion of their franchisees. Among other reasons,
small-business franchisees are having a frustrating time
trying to raise money in the present credit market.
   Says Mr. Fanning: "The current economic climate makes this
a very viable program."

   A NEW WAY to finance technology research is encountering
resistance.
   When small biotechnology companies -- such as Alza Corp.,
Centocor Inc. and Immunex Corp. -- last year raised research
capital through a new kind of stock offering,
corporate-finance specialists predicted an avalanche of
similar offerings.
   The financing vehicle involves selling stock in a spinoff
designed to develop a technology or products, instead of
selling stock in the parent company. As it allows companies
to finance longer-term research without reducing profits, it
seemed a logical fund-raising method for the hundreds of
cash-strapped technology companies.
   But since the first three such offerings, few companies
have followed suit. Investment bankers say they know of only
one other -- by Genzyme Corp., Boston -- that is actively
being planned.
   The offerings looked good when the stock market was strong
and technology stocks were underpriced, says Parag Saxena,
managing director of the health-care fund at Chancellor
Investment Management Inc., New York. But with the recent
stock-market weakness, he contends, the attraction has
dimmed.
   "Many companies aren't familiar with the financing
instrument," says Mark Simon, a biotechnology analyst with
Robertson &amp; Stephens, San Francisco. And because many
institutional investors haven't fully understood the
financing mechanism, "investment banks themselves have been
slow in offering it," he says. He thinks the strategy's
virtues were oversold.
   "It is only useful if a company has a defined program or
technology that is distinct from what the parent is doing,"
he explains.

   VENTURE CAPITAL for female entrepreneurs continues to be
elusive.
   Even though women now start an estimated two-thirds of all
new businesses each year, they receive less than 5% of all
venture-capital funds, says Des Moines, Iowa, venture
capitalist Jennifer Wilson. There are few signs things are
changing.
   Since the middle of 1989, Ms. Wilson has been trying to
raise $20 million for her Sky Venture Capital Fund to invest
in start-ups by women. But so far she has managed to obtain
less than $100,000.
   While all rookie venture capitalists are having a hard
time raising money, a fund directed at female entrepreneurs
seems to get a particularly chilly response. "Venture
advisers tell me there is no need for a fund that targets
women. They argue that venture capitalists never discriminate
on the basis of sex," Ms. Wilson says.
   Nevertheless, few venture firms have invested in concerns
run by women. The most successful examples, such as ASK
Computer Systems, Mountain View, Calif., and Lillian Vernon
Inc., Mount Vernon, N.Y., succeeded entirely on their own.
   Ms. Wilson concedes that many of the small businesses
launched by women, like most other small businesses, aren't
candidates for venture capital. But, "women as
entrepreneur/managers are an untapped resource," she
contends. "They've proven themselves not just in traditional
service businesses and retailing but in technology and
medical sciences."
   Since word got out about Ms. Wilson's proposed fund, more
than a hundred women have contacted her. Among their new
business ideas: new products for the veterinary market, an
exercise device for the physically disabled, and a treatment
for cellulite.

   AN INNER-CITY business development concern tries a
different approach.
   The Council for Equal Business Opportunity Inc.,
Baltimore, is joining with small minority businesses to
develop joint ventures with larger local corporations. CEBO's
approach to helping minority businesses not only will
generate revenue for local businesses but also new jobs,
contends Michael A. Gaines Sr., executive director of the
Council. Most of the past efforts by CEBO, a nonprofit
Baltimore concern, were focused on providing technical and
management assistance to minority-owned businesses.
   CEBO and its minority-owned partners recently signed a
joint-venture agreement with Orlando Group Inc., a Baltimore
computer concern, to develop software facility management
systems for local colleges and universities, especially those
with large minority enrollments. CEBO and its partners are
negotiating with a big electronics manufacturer to help
design and expand its manufacturing facilities.
   CEBO says it won't compete with for-profit businesses but
will help them train workers in science and technology. "Part
of our business development efforts are aimed at spotting
areas that are underserved and helping local businesses plug
those gaps," says Mr. Gaines.
   The ventures will greatly increase revenues for CEBO,
which has about 20 employees and an operating budget of $1
million.
