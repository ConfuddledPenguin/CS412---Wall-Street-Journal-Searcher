   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is recommending arms sales to
Saudi Arabia that could eventually total as much as $20
billion, a Bush administration official said.
   The official stressed, however, these military sales
essentially are in two distinct categories: those that answer
Saudi Arabia's immediate security needs and those that would
help safeguard its long-term interests.

   The official rejected the notion that this was a single
transaction. "It isn't one big package," and he stressed that
"the size of some sales will depend on how the situation (in
the Persian Gulf) unfolds."
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, the U.S. has so far
agreed to sell Saudi Arabia 24 F-15 jet fighters at a cost of
about $2.3 billion. These are expected to come out of U.S.
inventory and should be delivered quite quickly, the
administration official said.
   Future sales to Saudi Arabia are expected to include such
items as Apache helicopters, M-1 tanks, Bradley Fighting
Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Patriot air
defense systems.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials reacted with concern to
the prospects of a large U.S. arms sale to the Saudis. "We
object to this kind of arms deal and find it a threat," said
one official. The potential volume, number and sophistication
of the weapons under consideration could "affect the
qualitative edge" the Israeli forces rely on to deter an Arab
attack.
