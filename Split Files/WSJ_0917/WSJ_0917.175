   A group of United Airlines unions is likely to abandon its
most recent $201-a-share, $4.38 billion offer to acquire UAL
Corp. and has begun considering making a new lower offer,
according to people familiar with the group.
   However, the board of Chicago-based UAL may balk at a
lower bid, setting the stage for a possible new confrontation
with the pilots' union, which has been trying to gain control
of the carrier for three years.

   The union group signaled its intentions late Friday with
the disclosure that it had terminated an alliance with New
York money manager Coniston Partners, UAL's largest
shareholder with an 11.8% stake.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it took the step "in light of current market
conditions, and in order to maximize the {group's}
flexibility . . . to pursue any appropriate transaction for
the acquisition of UAL."
   Ending the accord with Coniston relieves the union group
of the legal obligation, imposed on members of any group
owning 5% or more of a company's stock, to make prompt
disclosures of changes in its plans.
   Severing the alliance also gives Coniston the freedom to
pursue a plan of its own to boost the price of UAL stock.
Coniston acquired its 2.5 million shares at an average
disclosed cost of $161 a share, and has a paper loss of $155
million.
   The next union offer seems likely to fall in a range of
$135 and $175 a share, a premium of 36% to 77% over the
current price. UAL stock closed Friday at $99, down $1.75, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The new
offer may include a stake of as much as 25% to be held by
existing UAL stockholders, with the unions keeping control.
   A source close to the group says the unions may use
financing from some of the suppliers who offered to help
finance the last bid. One proposal came from Airbus
Industrie, an aircraft maker owned by a European consortium.
   But any new offer is also likely to face both opposition
from the UAL board and skepticism from UAL stock holders.
This would be the fifth pilot-sponsored attempt since 1987 to
gain control of United.
   A $300-a-share, $6.79 billion offer led by pilots and UAL
management collapsed in October, triggering a mini-crash of
the entire stock market. And an April 9 offer of $201 a share
by pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- but without
management -- faltered after several big banks balked at
participating, and fuel prices soared after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
   When the UAL board in August granted the unions a
two-month extension -- until Oct. 9 -- to obtain financing
for its current bid, it said any new version would have to
provide "commensurate value" with the $201-a-share pricetag.
   "The board may say, we're not interested in any of this.
Let's get back to work," said one person familiar with the
situation. "We're running out of alternatives to
confrontation," said another.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who faces the loss of his job
if the union effort succeeds, has shown signs of trying to
regain the initiative among UAL employees by promoting the
airline's recent accomplishments. He has highlighted United's
expansion into Europe, and its retaking the No. 1 rank among
U.S. airlines in passenger traffic for the last three months.
Such an effort could be designed to exploit dissension in the
employee ranks over any new bid.
   UAL management has also been pressing the UAL board for
permission to make a $10 billion new-aircraft order for
expansion. The union group managed to block the order early
this summer on the grounds it would have undercut the group's
efforts to get supplier financing. Mr. Wolf has denied any
intention of trying to thwart the union bid.
   If the UAL board rejects a new union bid, the unions,
which have been working without a contract, could respond by
threatening labor strife. But Coniston, which forced the
board to accept the last union offer by threatening a proxy
fight, has lost some clout. Three months ago Coniston
announced plans to disband, citing as one reason the reduced
availability of financing for deals like this one.
   In addition, in its latest attempt to gain bank financing,
the union group enlisted several parties who may be reluctant
to join a hostile bid. They include Gerald Greenwald, former
vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., the unions'
chairman-designate of UAL, and outside directors such as
Richard Monroe, a former top executive of Time Warner Inc.
Also, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., which joined the union advisers,
doesn't usually advise hostile bidders.
