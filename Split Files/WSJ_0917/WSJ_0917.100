   TORONTO -- Almost 13,000 employees at Ford Motor Co.'s
Canadian subsidiary began striking Saturday, and the union
has threatened to walk away from the bargaining table by
Wednesday if progress isn't made toward a contract
settlement.
   Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said the two sides were still "miles apart" over
economic issues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-living
allowances. "Another couple of days of this and we'll have to
discuss seriously recessing the talks," he said.

   A breakdown in negotiations likely would drag out the
strike long enough to begin hobbling some of Ford's key U.S.
plants, which depend on parts, especially engines, made in
Canada. Ford has said it would need to begin closing some of
its U.S. operations within two weeks of a Canadian strike.
   Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a prolonged
strike could further hurt the company at a time of economic
slowdown and increasingly competitive markets. Ford Canada
has forecast sales in the current model year, which ends
Sept. 30, of 992,000 cars and 453,000 trucks, representing a
decline of 9% from the previous year.
   Mr. Hartford acknowledged that "considerable differences"
separated the two sides. Nevertheless he hinted that the
company could make a new contract offer to the union by early
this week.
   "We want this to be a short strike. Obviously the ball is
in our court," Mr. Hartford said.
   The union began negotiations Sept. 5 after selecting Ford
as a contract target. Since then, the company has made one
contract offer, which was swiftly rejected by the union. The
union claimed the company wasn't offering nearly enough
money. A counteroffer by the union was similarly turned down
by Ford.
   Any contract reached at Ford will serve as the basis for
subsequent negotiations with the Canadian subsidiaries of
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Contracts at each of
the Big Three auto makers, covering a total of 61,000 workers
in Canada, expired Friday.
   The strike, the first against Ford in North America since
1976, has shut nine Ford plants in Canada. The largest of
those affected is the company's St. Thomas, Ontario, assembly
plant, which is the sole source for the large Mercury Grand
Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria models.
   In addition, Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant builds
the six-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car.
Company officials said the highly profitable Wixom, Mich.,
plant that builds the Continental likely would be the first
U.S. operation to be hurt by a lengthy strike in Canada.
   Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the sole
provider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truck
assembly operations in the U.S. In all, about 80% of Ford's
Canadian output is exported to the U.S.
