   Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, a West German engineering and
machinery concern, posted first-half net income of five
million marks ($3.2 million), reversing a year-earlier loss
of 30 million marks.
   World-wide group sales advanced 10% to 1.88 billion marks
from 1.7 billion marks. Year-earlier figures were adjusted
downward to account for shedding operations.

   Amid a far-reaching corporate restructuring, Kloeckner's
return to profitability was apparently aided by the disposal
of some unprofitable businesses in the past 12 months. On the
basis of continuing operations, the company said its five
million-mark profit compared with a year-earlier loss of 18
million marks.
   Kloeckner's order backlog at June 30 increased 22% to 2.08
billion marks.
   For 1990, Kloeckner said it expects "better operating
earnings" than the year-earlier 44 million marks, before
taxes and extraordinary charges, and expressed confidence
about posting net. In 1989, after charges of 194.1 million
marks, the company had a net loss of 170 million marks on
4.06 billion marks of world-wide sales.
