   The Vietnamese lesson has borne much "bad" fruit: Iraq,
after having invaded Kuwait, has purely and simply annexed
it. In Kuwait, before its annexation, Iraq did exactly what
Vietnam did in Cambodia on December 1978: massive attacks
using hundreds of tanks, heavy artillery, airplanes and
thousands of infantrymen; a setting up of a puppet
government; the dispatching of settlers; then the so-called
withdrawal of regular forces leaving only "volunteers."
   The difference between the Vietnamese case and that of
Iraq is that Iraq has now annexed Kuwait while Vietnam
continues to try to integrate Cambodia into its "Indochinese
Federation." Vietnam has not yet succeeded, after having
tried for more than 11 years, thanks on the one hand to the
existence of a Cambodian National Resistance under the
leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and on the other to
the firm support of the member nations of ASEAN and other
countries espousing the values of peace and justice.

   The Vietnamese lesson, well learned by Iraq, gives one
food for thought: The commander in chief of the Royal Thai
Army, during his visit to inspect troops in the eastern
region, has clearly warned them against a "possible
intervention of foreign troops from Cambodia," referring to
the recent Iraqi invasion. On this subject, the deputy prime
minister of Singapore has used language even more firm and
has launched an unequivocal warning. The other nations of the
world, especially those of middle and small size, without
mentioning them, should not be far from sharing the fear.
   Unfortunately, the U.S. and Western Europe (the Common
Market) are heading for a dialogue with Vietnam and a
resumption of aid to this country, which would signify the
acceptance by the Western nations of the Vietnamese fait
accompli in Cambodia. A de facto recognition by the Western
nations and the Western press of the Phnom Penh regime set up
by Vietnamese tanks and carried out through the various forms
of Vietnamese presence would prove to Iraq and others that
acts of aggression will pay off as long as one has the
audacity and patience.
   Is it not a bitter lesson for us, the little and
middle-size states, and equally for those who are friends of
the West?
   On Behalf of
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh
   Personal Representative,
   HRH Samdech Norodom Sihanouk
   in Cambodia and Asia,
   Supreme Commander of the ANKI
   Nady Tan
   Representative,
   HRH Samdech Norodom Sihanouk
   to the West Coast, U.S.A.
