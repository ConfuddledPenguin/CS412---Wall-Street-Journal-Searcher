   FRESNO, Calif. -- WestAir Holding Inc. said it realigned
some routes flown by its United Express airline unit. That
move includes the addition of new service and the suspension
of other service that will entail furloughing pilots and
other personnel.
   Among the changes, WestAir said it plans to begin service
Oct. 15 between Dulles airport outside Washington, D.C., and
Charlotte, N.C. On Oct. 31, WestAir said it will expand
service between Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as resume
flights between Long Beach, Calif., and San Jose, Calif.

   WestAir also announced cutbacks in service that will
result in the termination of 99 of its about 2,780 employees.
Included are 25 customer-service personnel and 24 pilots. In
addition, 50 pilots are set to be furloughed as the result of
schedule adjustments in California, WestAir said.
   The company added that it plans to retire a dozen aircraft
by year end, replacing them with more fuel-efficient models.
Currently, the company has a fleet of about 100 aircraft.
