   MLADA BOLESLAV, Czechoslovakia -- For the Czech car maker
Skoda Automobilovy Concern, it's nice to be wanted.
   Last week's announcement by Renault S.A. that AB Volvo has
joined its bid for Skoda shows just how heated the
competition has become for a piece of the state-owned
automobile company. To press their case, Volvo's chairman,
Pehr Gyllenhammar, and his Renault counterpart, Raymond Levy,
are currently in Prague during an official visit by French
President Francois Mitterrand.

   Since January, no fewer than 24 companies have expressed
at least a passing interest in Skoda, with numerous
foreigners visiting its plant in this small industrial town
in northern Bohemia. Now, after months of courtship and
negotiating, the finalists are Renault-Volvo and Volkswagen
AG. Each hopes a venture with Skoda would provide a big edge
in Eastern Europe.
   For Renault and Volvo, already linked by a
cross-shareholding pact signed last February, the joint bid
offers a way to spread the investment costs. For Skoda, which
has 21,000 employees, the bid now offers the chance of a
partnership with both a European mass producer and a maker of
prestigious luxury cars.
   Volkswagen and Renault-Volvo will complete their
feasibility studies within a month, says Petr Dedek, Skoda's
45-year-old general director. By then Skoda will have been
converted into a joint stock company. "And that is when the
decision-making will begin," he says.
   Both Volkswagen and Renault, respectively Western Europe's
No. 1 and No. 6 auto makers in terms of market share, already
have tested their auto parts in Skoda cars. But the two are
keeping the financial terms of their proposal under wraps.
   Skoda, citing confidentiality agreements, also is avoiding
making any comment on specific proposals.
   Currently, Prague allows a foreign majority interest in a
joint venture with a domestic firm, but so far has been
undecided on the degree of direct ownership it will allow in
a Czechoslovak company. Skoda, shaping up as an early test
case, is to be given a special ruling.
   "It is a special case in terms of national prestige and
employment," says a finance ministry official, adding: "Skoda
is such an important company that it is politically
sensitive, and (the transaction) has to be decided by the
government, perhaps even parliament."
   While the decision may have to come from the government,
the winner probably will be the bidder going the furthest in
accommodating Mr. Dedek's priority of a costly modernization
program to preserve jobs.
   "We knew that the opening of markets didn't give us a
chance to survive independently for long," says Mr. Dedek,
who early on turned to the international accounting firm
Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. for help in tallying up assets and
finding a likely partner in the West.
   Total investment? "I hate to say it, but about $2
billion," says Mr. Dedek. He quickly adds that the return
won't be long in coming, though, asserting that "Eastern
Europe is starved for cars."
   To compete with Western cars, Mr. Dedek says Skoda
desperately needs a new series of more powerful engines. The
paint plant, dating from 1964, needs to be replaced by a
modern facility. Mr. Dedek is asking for new technology and
wants to add production capacity to increase annual output to
as much as 400,000 cars by the year 2000, compared with
183,000 currently. In addition, Skoda is insisting that its
Western partner bring Skoda cars into the partner's global
marketing, distribution and servicing network.
   Volkswagen, which rushed in its bid early, has the
advantage of its cross-border proximity to the Skoda plants
in the northwest corner of Czechoslovakia. Volkswagen already
plans to invest four billion marks ($2.5 billion) in a new
production facility in Zwickau, East Germany.
   Moreover, Skoda officials speak with admiration of
Volkswagen's experience with Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles
de Turismo S.A. of Spain. Volkswagen acquired the troubled
Spanish auto maker in 1986 and turned it around by selling
SEAT's Ibiza models through Volkswagen's own sales system.
   For Renault-Volvo, Skoda is an opportunity to pull even
with its West German competitor in Eastern Europe and to add
a line of low-cost cars to the pair's line-up of models.
   Of two dozen auto makers, including Japanese producers
that looked at Skoda, most dropped out immediately because of
Skoda's preference for linking up with another European mass
producer. Others withdrew after assessing the costs of a
Skoda modernization and the sheer size of Skoda's operation.
   One of those was the European operations of General Motors
Corp., which is looking to expand its production capacity in
Europe by 25% during the next decade. GM's West German unit,
Adam Opel AG, already has taken over a former East German
auto plant in Eisenach, where it is considering a $700
million investment in new capacity. But GM decided against
Skoda after a lengthy look.
   About 45 years after it was spun off from the Skoda
industrial works in Pilsen, Skoda still makes only the basic
Favorit, a five-door hatchback with a small 1300cc engine,
unveiled in 1988. Next month, the auto maker will introduce a
second car called the Forman, essentially a station-wagon
version of the Favorit.
   In 1989, Skoda sold 114,040 cars in Czechoslovakia, 51,350
in Western Europe and 17,624 in other Comecon countries,
including the Soviet Union.
   Sales last year totaled about 10 billion crowns, or about
$588 million.
   Skoda managers were quick to realize their vulnerability
after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, which had shielded
the firm from direct competition with Western producers. "In
November we knew that it was all over," Mr. Dedek says.
   Currently, Skoda charges Czechsolovaks 85,000 crowns
(about $5,000 at current commercial exchange rates) -- or two
years' wages for the average industrial worker -- for a
basic, no-frills Favorit. The car costs about 50,000 crowns
($2,941) to produce, and the state takes almost all the
35,000-crown profit, leaving Skoda with only 700 crowns a car
for reinvestment. In the West, Skoda charges about $7,740 for
a Favorit, about 55% more than its domestic price.
   Management estimates that if its 250 major suppliers start
charging in hard currency or at Western price levels, Skoda
may have to charge 200,000 crowns for a Favorit to turn a
profit. Increased energy costs, alone, could add another
5,000 crowns to the cost of producing a car, executives say.
