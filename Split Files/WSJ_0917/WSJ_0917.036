   My career was a shambles. Every time I told my editor a
joke he would throw me out of his office. My clothes were
ill-fitting and poorly color-coordinated. Better restaurants
would not let me eat in them because of my atrocious table
manners. Then a miracle happened. The three books reviewed
below landed on my desk. Today, I am on the fast track at
work. Colleagues stop by and ask me for advice on which fork
to use for their lunch engagements at Lutece. Then they want
to know if I think their tie matches their socks. And I
receive more invitations to give after-dinner speeches than I
can comfortably handle. If you envy my new-found condition in
life, read on.
   "The Concise Guide to Executive Etiquette" (Doubleday, 194
page, $9.95), by Linda and Wayne Phillips, is a little book
-- it's actually pocket-size -- so you need never be without
the correct answers. After reading it I found out how many
things I had been doing wrong. For example, suppose an
amorous couple sitting in front of you at the theater are
keeping their heads together and spoiling your view. Before
reading this book I would have said: "Hey you jerks. If you
want to fool around, rent a hotel room." The Phillipses
suggest: "I can't see if you keep your heads together."

   What about giving your boss a birthday gift? My rule: Only
give whoopee cushions, squirt guns or similar items of high
intrinsic and intense emotional value. Such gifts can never
be misconstrued. The Phillipses suggest a thoughtful letter
telling your employer how much you enjoy your association
with the company.
   How good a wine should you order when dining with a client
(or a source)? My solution: "Waiter, we would like a
half-gallon of anything with `Thunder' or `Strawberry' in its
name." The Phillipses agree with me on this one. They say
don't order expensive wines because it sends a negative
message to the client: "Oh, am I going to make a lot of money
off you]"

   G. Bruce Boyer, author of "Eminently Suitable" (Norton,
256 pages, $19.95), has written a book that is supposed to
help men learn to dress tastefully. He doesn't tell the
reader outright how he should dress. He just gives him a role
model and says the reader should dress as he dresses. His
ideal: Fred Astaire. He claims that Mr. Astaire had what is
known in Italian as "sprezzatura", which translates as
nonchalance. He claims that dressing with nonchalance is a
studied pose and that it is a skill worth acquiring. Mr.
Boyer says no one is born with it.
   Nonchalance, according to the author, is achieved through
the smaller touches -- a scarf, a pair of socks or an
out-of-the-ordinary hat. He says such touches will do more
than purple slacks and a mauve topcoat. (Oh shucks. There
goes my one really stylish outfit of which I am most fond.)
Even after reading Mr. Boyer's book I am not sure many men
will look like they are ready to pick up their top hats and
canes and give Ginger Rogers a whirl around the dance floor.
The author admits that this is so toward the end of the book
when he writes, "Sprezzatura is a bit like jazz or poetry:
easy to recognize, sticky to define, difficult to do well."

   Many of us have learned the hard way that there is a
difference between telling a joke to a few friends and
telling one to an audience in a business setting. But Malcolm
Kushner in his book "The Light Touch" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 270
pages, $18.95) says it is because we inevitably make The Big
Mistake: We try to use humor that is irrelevant to the point
of the talk. Mr. Kushner claims humor can be used, among
other things, to manage conflict, motivate people and improve
productivity. He says you have to be neither a comedian nor
"naturally funny." According to Mr. Kushner, the key to using
humor successfully frequently can be found in analogies that
have a twist to them. They let a speaker make a point and put
the audience in a receptive frame of mind simultaneously.
   Consider the spot an executive found himself in after
giving a presentation to a hostile audience. He turned for
help to an analogy that he hoped would turn some of the
audience's anger to sympathy for his message. He concluded
with: "Thank you. I feel like a friend of mine, who had to
ride his bicycle home after a vasectomy."
   Mr. Kushner says making humor relevant can be cured by
using the rule of the three As: Authorize, Analyze and
Analogize. Authorize means that the author should first write
his serious message. The humor should only be inserted into
the talk to augment the talk's basic points. That is followed
by Analysis of the serious message to see how humor can help.
Finally, by Analogy the speaker can relate an anecdote to one
of the serious points.
   As an example he cites a litigator who was to be the fifth
defense attorney to make a closing argument after a very long
trial. There was nothing he could say that hadn't been said
and the jury knew it. The litigator began: "I feel sort of
like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband. I think I know what to
do, but I don't know if I can make it interesting." The jury
howled and listened to every word of his closing argument.
