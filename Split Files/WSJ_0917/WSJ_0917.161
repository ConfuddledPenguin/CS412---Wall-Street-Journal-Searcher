   WASHINGTON -- Republicans proposed a limit on all tax
deductions for taxpayers making more than $200,000 annually,
in their continuing effort to persuade Democrats to accept a
cut in the capital-gains tax rates, according to top
congressional aides.
   The Republicans made the counteroffer during budget talks
yesterday after rejecting the Democrats' bid to pair the
capital-gains tax cut with higher income taxes on the rich.
Though Democratic leaders have repeatedly suggested the
trade-off, the proposal marked the first time they had done
so formally during the four-month-old budget summit.

   The tax issue, which has loomed large over the
deficit-reduction talks, has intensified as fiscal deadlines
approach. Without a budget package to reduce the fiscal 1991
deficit, projected at more than $250 billion,
across-the-board cuts of at least $85 billion would take
effect after the fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   President Bush and GOP negotiators have insisted that
capital-gains taxes be reduced, while adamantly opposing any
offsetting increase in income-tax rates. To date, Republicans
have said they want to leave the relative burdens on rich and
poor about where they are today, but Democrats have pressed
their drive to use the deficit-reduction package as a vehicle
for a more progressive tax code -- that is, one that would
require upper-income Americans to pay more.
   The Republican proposal would set the limits on deductions
for families earning more than $200,000 at levels sufficient
to bring more than $20 billion into the Treasury over a
five-year period. That sum would offset the estimated
five-year revenue loss from the GOP capital-gains proposal.
   Earlier this summer, Republicans proposed limiting the
deductions the wealthy can take for state and local taxes to
$10,000, a change that would affect mostly the rich in
certain states, such as California and New York. The GOP's
new approach would cover all of the deductions, including
those for mortgage interest and charitable donations. The
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that
almost everyone who earns more than $200,000 annually takes
deductions, while less than one-quarter of those making under
$50,000 take advantage of the deductions.
   Democrats have made similar proposals in the past. Rep.
Don Pease (D., Ohio), a member of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee, has circulated a plan that would trim all
deductions for families with incomes above $100,000 annually
and single people with incomes above $50,000.
   In yesterday's budget talks at Andrews Air Force Base,
where participants have secluded themselves for more than a
week, Democrats made their conditional offer to accept
reduced capital-gains taxes in return for higher income tax
rates to a small group of negotiators who were meeting to
thrash out tax issues, the congressional aides said.
   "This is the crunch point," one of the aides said.
"Without this combination, these talks are going nowhere."
   The Republicans are seeking to cut the maximum
capital-gains rate to 15% from 33%. Under the Democratic
version, the top capital-gains tax rate would effectively be
23.1%, an aide said.
   In return for the tax cut, Democrats proposed to raise the
top marginal income tax rate to 35%. In doing so, that would
end an anomaly in the tax code that allows the wealthiest
Americans to pay a top marginal rate of 28%, while some less
well-off taxpayers pay a top rate of 33%. Democrats also
proposed to raise the alternative minimum tax for individuals
-- paid by upper-income individuals who would otherwise avoid
taxes under the regular tax system -- to 25% from 21%.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D., Wash.), who one of the
congressional aides said was present when the Democratic
offer was made, gave some hint of the proposal earlier
yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press." He said that Democrats
would agree to cut capital-gains taxes only "if there were a
balancing burden-sharing by high-income, wealthy taxpayers."
   "We have to have a balance," agreed Senate Republican
Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who also was on "Meet the
Press." "We have to have progressivity, and I think we're
going to have it."
   By his comment, Sen. Dole turned up the pressure on his
fellow GOP negotiators to support, in exchange for any
capital-gains tax cut, some offsetting changes that would
shift more of the tax burden to the wealthy.
   The issue of progressivity gained prominence at the talks
last Friday after published reports, in this newspaper and
others, that analyses showed the administration's tax ideas
would benefit those taxpayers with annual incomes above
$50,000, and add to the burden for those making less. In
contrast, the Democrats' proposals would increase the tax
liability for those making more than $20,000 a year, and
lighten the burden for those with incomes below that amount.
   Publication of those conclusions from the bipartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation infuriated Republicans, who already are
sensitive to Democrats' election-year drive to paint the GOP
as the party of the rich. GOP negotiators took to the Senate
floor to accuse Democrats of leaking the analyses for
political gain.
   Sen. Dole, his voice quaking with rage, stopped just short
of saying the talks should be aborted. "If capital-gains
rates is the issue, we ought to solve it today, or nothing
else happens, period," he said Friday. "If everything blows
up, Democrats go, `Oh well, it blew up because Republicans
are trying to protect the rich.' We're not trying to protect
anyone. We're trying to do a very difficult job, in
cooperation with our Democratic colleagues. Of course, it's
not going to work if this garbage keeps piling up day after
day."
   Meanwhile, negotiators who are working on spending cuts
lost ground in yesterday's sessions, according to a top
congressional aide. Proposed savings of $128 billion over
five years in federal benefit programs has eroded to about
$90 billion as negotiators backed away from committing to
certain cuts in Medicare and other programs. Summit
participants have set a goal of $50 billion in budget cuts in
fiscal 1991 and $500 billion over the next five years.
   Negotiators have been considering proposals to make
Medicare beneficiaries pay substantially more for their
health insurance and to curb cost-of-living adjustments for
federal retirement programs. Also at issue are competing
schemes to alter the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Sen. Dole said negotiators have set yet another deadline
-- midnight tonight. Past deadlines have come and gone
without success. Others close to the talks, however,
suggested it may take more time to complete what negotiator
Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) is calling "the blueprint for
federal spending for the next five years."
   Endorsing a suggestion that people close to the talks say
was first made by Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, yesterday on ABC's "This Week with
David Brinkley," urged that the Senate and House postpone any
floor votes until negotiators reach a compromise.
