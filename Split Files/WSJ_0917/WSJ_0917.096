   Tokyo stocks finished lower Friday as heavy futures and
options related selling because of the close of the September
futures contract met some resistance from investment trust
fund buying by the Big Four securities houses.
   Traders said a weak day in the Japanese government bond
market aggravated fears of interest rate increases, damping
sentiment.

   London shares finished close to the day's lowest level as
the market was hurt by a poor session on Wall Street and a
discounted futures market.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues was down 177.62 points,
or 0.71%, at 24897.46. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 530 million shares, down from 565.9 million
Thursday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 691 to 294, while
144 issues were unchanged.
   In early trading Monday, the Nikkei index fell another
207.15 points to close the morning session at 24690.31.
   In Friday's trading, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed in the first section fell 17 points, or 0.89%,
to 1895.68.
   The second section index fell 11.18 points, or 0.31%, to
3586.82. Volume in the section was estimated at seven million
shares, down from 7.5 million shares Thursday.
   Traders said there was a huge amount of sell orders at the
start of trading Friday as the market moved to settle
arbitrage positions.
   "There were 14.5 million sell orders at the opening. I
thought the market would fall 500 points," said one trader.
   However, the trader said new investment trust funds set up
by the Big Four securities firms "bought cash like crazy to
support the market."
   Although the volume of trading was relatively heavy
compared with recent levels, traders said dealings were
mostly lethargic following the early flurry of activity, with
institutional investors on the sidelines.
   Traders said the seven-basis point rise on the benchmark
Japanese government bond to 8.415% at the close of stock
trading depressed sentiment, aggravating fears of further
interest rate increases. A basis point is 1/100th of a
percentage point.
   Traders said most sectors suffered overall declines
Friday.
   But despite the drop, many traders said they see the
market poised to move higher in the near future.
   Amy Yip, sales manager with Baring Securities Ltd., said
the market could push higher to around 28000 points.
   "The market has been worrying about oil prices, the yen
and interest rates," Ms. Yip said. "The yen has turned
positive and the impact of higher oil on the Japanese economy
looks less negative than originally feared so you can say
that 1 1/2 of the factors have turned positive," Ms. Yip
said.
   Stephen Good, a sales representative with McIntosh
Securities, said the recent uptick in trading volume suggests
that a number of individual investors are returning to the
market.
   Mr. Good said the potential for one more discount rate
increase could weigh on the market for the near term but once
that is out of the way, the market should be set to recover
on the strength of Japanese economic fundamentals.
   Traders said expected buying at around 24000 points plus
the potential addition of more than 200 billion yen ($1.47
billion) in new investment trust funds could begin to send
the market higher.
   Traders said they expect growing interest in Japanese
investments will start with the bond market and spill over
into the stock market.
   However, some participants remain bearish about the
market's outlook.
   "There weren't a lot of institutional investors out there
buying" Friday, said one trader. "There were just four or
five big players supporting the market and they had to eat an
awful lot of stocks to keep it at this level. And there were
a lot of people eager to sell," the trader added.
   In London, traders said that with the escalation of
hostilities in the Middle East and Friday's disclosure of an
unexpectedly high 10.6% U.K. August inflation rate, caution
would prevail in the market for the near future.
   "It was an unhappy end to a lackluster week," one trader
said. Wall Street's decline during the course of London
trading generated selling pressure in the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 futures market, prompting falls in
the main market, traders said.
   Market makers retained control of price movements in a
"trendless market," one trader said, as only selective buying
occured.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed down 33.3 points at
2093.8, falling steadily after a midmorning recovery pushed
the market to an intraday high of 2122.1.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 30.3 points to
1609.6; volume was 418 million shares, up from Thursday's
335.4 million shares.
   In the futures markets, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract traded at 2085, down from Thursday's close of 2137.
   Among the main movers in the market, chemicals
conglomerate ICI slipped 36 pence to 829 pence (68 cents to
$15.60) following a statement in Toronto on Thursday by the
chairman that was taken by some analysts to indicate a
slowdown in the company's earnings in the year ahead. The
company, however, said his remarks pertained to a general,
global economic slowdown.
   Thorn EMI gained 4 pence to 616 pence, helped by a buy
recommendation from securities house Kleinwort Benson.
   Brewing concern Bass fell 32 pence to 958 pence as
Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut the company's profit forecast.
Other brewing stocks fared poorly. Allied-Lyons fell 10 pence
to 465 pence and Grand Metropolitan dropped 7 pence to 564
pence.
   Rank Organisation fell 32 pence to 558 pence. One trader
said the fall followed news of a downgrading by a London
brokerage firm, while another trader said he detected selling
pressure from New York.
   Water stocks held firm. Thames Water added a penny to 227
pence. North West Water gained 3 pence to 223 pence.
   Enterprise Oil, down 15 pence to 650 pence, was hit by
continuing rumors that Elf Aquitaine might sell its stake in
the company. Other oil stocks, were mixed.
   Meanwhile, shares closed lower on all major European and
Asian markets. South African gold stocks closed narrowly
mixed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
