   Manpower PLC, the Anglo-American employment services group
formerly named Blue Arrow, said it is selling a large part of
its British operations to an investor group for #106 million
($199.6 million).
   The assets include the Blue Arrow Personnel Services and
Brook Street Bureau employment services units that formed
part of the original Blue Arrow group which bought
Milwaukee-based Manpower Inc. in 1987.

   The investor group behind the purchase includes executive
directors of Brook Street as well as Chase Manhattan Bank,
Charterhouse Bank Ltd. and Prudential Venture Managers.
   Manpower will take a 15% stake in the company formed to
make the purchase and will be allowed to put a representative
on its board, the company said.
   Manpower will receive the payment in cash, though it has
promised to reinvest #2 million in variable-rate non-voting
preference shares. The exact consideration is subject to an
audit of the sold properties.
   Mitchell Fromstein, who headed Manpower at the time of
Blue Arrow's hostile bid and who last year gained control of
the merged companies in a board-room coup, has set about
restructuring the debt-burdened company. Along with the name
change, he has proposed reincorporating the company in the
U.S.
   Manpower said the sale reflects its desire to focus its
operations in the U.K. temporary help market under a single
brand name and eliminate competition among wholly owned units
of the company.
