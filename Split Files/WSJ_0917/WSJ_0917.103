   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The former deputy president of P.T.
Bank Duta has been detained by Indonesian police in
connection with investigations of major, unexplained losses
at the bank.
   The Indonesian government, in a bid to deal with the
scandal, appears to be pursuing two separate probes into
dealings at Bank Duta. The Bank is the fifth-largest in the
country. The investigations -- one by the central bank and
one by Attorney General Singgih -- are unlikely to be
completed quickly, observers say.

   Police, acting on orders of Mr. Singgih, detained Dicky
Iskandar Di Nata on Thursday, who was Bank Duta's deputy
president until he, other managers and the whole board of
supervisors were fired Sept. 4. Although no formal charge has
been placed against him, the 40-year-old Mr. Dicky can remain
in detention for some time under Indonesian law.
   Indonesian newspapers reported that authorities have
seized Mr. Dicky's assets and industry sources close to the
bank say that losses of about $300 million were accumulated.
   Bank Duta's own position has been secured, as the majority
shareholders -- three charity foundations chaired by
President Suharto -- have injected new capital to make good
the losses. But many questions remain about how the losses
were incurred and were kept from supervisors at the central
bank, Bank Indonesia, and minority shareholders of Bank Duta,
which sold shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange last May.
