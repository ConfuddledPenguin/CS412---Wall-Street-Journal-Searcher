   CSX Corp. moved closer to acquiring the rail operations of
RF&amp;P Corp.
   CSX, a Richmond, Va., freight transportation company,
agreed to a proposal under which it would acquire RF&amp;P's rail
operations in exchange for CSX's 62.7% voting position in
RF&amp;P.

   Virginia Retirement System, which initiated the
transaction, would acquire CSX's remaining shares in RF&amp;P for
$35 each. Virginia Retirement System, the second-largest
independent RF&amp;P holder, owns about 28% of the combined
voting and nonvoting shares.
   CSX said the proposed transaction would result in RF&amp;P's
retaining all of its real estate while transferring to CSX
only its railroad operations in a tax-free transaction. RF&amp;P
owns the 113-mile Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac
Railroad, which links the northern and southern parts of
CSX's rail system.
   The transaction is subject to approval by RF&amp;P's board,
the board of CSX, and Virginia Retirement System trustees.
   This past spring, CSX offered to pay one share of its
common or $34.50 cash -- a total of $385 million -- for each
RF&amp;P share it didn't already own. But CSX withdrew the offer
amid opposition from RF&amp;P holders who deemed the bid too low.

   CSX Corp. said the Virginia Retirement System proposed an
exchange of a portion of CSX's RF&amp;P Corp. dividend
obligations for the stock of an RF&amp;P subsidiary that holds
the RF&amp;P railroad. The Virginia Retirement System also
proposed that it purchase CSX's remaining RF&amp;P dividend
obligations and its RF&amp;P voting shares at $35 a share. In
yesterday's edition, terms of the transaction were misstated.
