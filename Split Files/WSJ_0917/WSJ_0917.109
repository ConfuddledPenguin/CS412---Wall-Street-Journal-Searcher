   Consumers Are Likely
   To Start Cutting Back

   NEW YORK -- The consumer, many economists have been saying
for some time, has been carrying the burden of keeping the
economy's long expansion going.
   Now, with the Mideast crisis raising oil prices, the
consumer's burden is growing heavier. Other sectors of the
economy are, at best, stagnant.

   Manufacturing is slipping, and capital-spending plans were
recently trimmed by U.S. companies for the second time this
year. Bruce Steinberg notes in Merrill Lynch's weekly
commentary that "the oil shock may lead to a further paring."
   Investment in housing also is weak. Most baby-boomers are
housed, fewer homes are being bought as sure-fire
investments, and many battered lenders are clamping down on
real-estate loans.
   Exports are chugging along fairly well but probably won't
increase much. The falling dollar should help a bit but may
be offset by a slide in the economies of some major trading
partners. Fearing inflation, they seem likely to curb
economic growth.
   And American governmental bodies at practically all levels
are too debt-burdened to expand their spending significantly.
                                                                                                       

   So, the pivotal role of consumers, who typically account
for two-thirds of economic activity, has gained in
importance. But the trouble is, as Mr. Steinberg notes,
"consumer spending was already in a no-growth recession
pattern before the oil-price shock."
                                                                                                       

   Even before Iraq seized Kuwait, surveys of consumer
sentiment had been showing some weakness. Afterward, the
numbers from both the Conference Board and the University of
Michigan's Survey Research Center plunged, as the chart
shows, and consumers may soon cut back (see accompanying
illustration -- WSJ Sept. 17, 1990).
   Consumers have ample reason to grow wary about spending.
Unemployment is rising, hitting a two-year high of 5.6% of
the civilian work force last month. Manufacturers continued
to cut payrolls, the service sector saw almost no employment
gains outside the health field, and job growth was weaker
than at any time since the last recession. Many people who
lost high-paying jobs in basic industry may be working again,
but only in lower-paying services.
   Consequently, personal income seems likely to start
sagging. In July, even before Iraq struck, consumer debt
expanded at a 7.4% annual rate, the fastest pace since
October. The apparent reason, a lag in debt repayments by
strapped consumers, was hardly reassuring. In addition, the
Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy relatively tight.
In August, retail sales fell 0.6%.
   And now, economists at Merrill Lynch say, "The oil shock
intensifies existing problems, and we expect consumer
spending to be stagnant in coming months."
   However, they aren't talking disaster. They note that a
$30-a-barrel price for the Saudi benchmark crude is "still
well below the $39-a-barrel level reached in 1979. Indeed, in
real terms, crude oil prices would need to exceed $60 a
barrel to get up to the 1979 level."
                                                                                                       

   Economists at Regional Financial Associates Inc. say
"improved energy efficiency has reduced the vulnerability of
the U.S. economy." They observe that consumption has fallen
to an estimated 4.75 British thermal units per dollar of real
output from 5.25 BTUs in the early 1980s and 5.5 BTUs in the
early 1970s.
                                                                                                       

   The fact that the economy was stronger in 1973 and 1979
makes a difference, too. In those years, says Edward Yardeni,
director of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities, "many
companies were able to pass on the increased costs of
energy," and "the Fed responded to the surge of inflation by
raising interest rates to levels that caused a recession."
   This time, Mr. Yardeni adds, "intense domestic and
international competition, combined with slack demand,
suggest that most of the increase in energy costs will come
out of profits, rather than boost prices." But he warns that
"weak profits could dampen capital spending and trigger
layoffs" and that higher oil prices, by reducing consumers'
purchasing power, "have the same depressing impact on
consumer spending as a tax increase."
   Not surprisingly, most economists have grown more
pessimistic. The consensus of those surveyed monthly by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter,
expects inflation-adjusted gross national product to rise
only 1.1% this year, against a 1.3% forecast in August. For
next year, the predicted increase in real GNP has dwindled to
1.2% from 1.7% a month earlier.
   And in what the newsletter calls "a sharp reversal of
earlier views," 25 of the 50 Blue Chip forecasters now expect
a recession to begin this year. Clearly, they don't see
consumer spending performing any miracles in rescuing the
economy from the effects of higher oil prices or other
problems.
