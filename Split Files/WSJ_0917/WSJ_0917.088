   Prime Motor Inns Inc., unable to shake off its cash
problems, said it may file for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The financially strapped operator of hotels said that it
was having difficulty obtaining an additional loan from its
bank lenders, and that unless the loan and other relief is
granted, Prime will "seriously consider filing a petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11."

   The threat of a Prime bankruptcy-law filing for protection
from creditors' lawsuits caught some securities analysts off
guard. "The company doesn't even talk to investors anymore,"
Caroline Levy, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
said. "It looks very bad."
   Prime, based in Fairfield, N.J., said that although it
asked for and received from the bank lenders an extension on
the maturity date of loans to July 1991 from March 1991 and
the authority to retain part of proceeds from asset sales,
the banks were "reluctant" to extend any additional loans.
   Prime had requested an additional $25 million line of
credit, but Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. said it would consider
providing the loan only if this could be secured by certain
assets. The company, which had $328 million in bank debt
outstanding last year, has been able reduce bank debt to $110
million under a debt restructuring program that calls for the
selective sale of assets.
   Prime said that it will suspend payment of dividends on
its common shares and that it doesn't expect to make interest
payments on its convertible debentures.
   Two related limited partnerships said that if Prime were
to seek bankruptcy court protection, they also would be hurt.
   Prime Motor Inns Limited Partnership, which indirectly
owns 16 Holiday Inn motels leased to a Prime Motor Inns unit,
said a filing could result in smaller distributions to its
unit holders. And Ramada Assured Income Associates, which is
managed by two Prime Motor Inns units, said a filing could
result in smaller payout to unit holders.
   Prime's latest problems follow a tumultuous decline of
what was once one of the nation's largest hotel companies.
The company's motor inn business took a huge leap in 1986,
when Prime acquired the Howard Johnson motel chain, followed
by a further major acquisitions in the late 1980s.
   Last Friday, Prime shares closed at $1.375, down 37.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume
exceeded 1.6 million shares, making it was the fifth most
active issue on the Big Board. The stock, which traded as
high as $38 last year, has swooned in recent days; the shares
traded as high as $5 on Aug. 22 but fell to slightly more
than $2 early last week.
   Short-sellers also have put pressure on the stock. As of
Aug. 15, bearish investors had sold short about 6.2 million
Prime shares. The company has about 33 million shares
outstanding. A short-seller sells shares in anticipation of a
decline in price, and hopes to secure a profit by
repurchasing the shares at a lower price.
   Prime has been battered by a decline in its asset value
and by lower earnings, which fell to $209,000, or one cent a
share, in its third quarter ended March 31, from $18.2
million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company last month said it would take a $150 million
pretax write-off on certain assets, which would result in a
loss for the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended
June 30.
   Prime continued to shrink when it sold in July its Ramada
and Howard Johnson franchise system to Blackstone Capital
Partners, New York, for $170 million and its Rodeway
franchise system to Manor Care Inc., Silver Spring, Md., for
$14.9 million. That left Prime with about 136 hotels with
14,000 rooms, down from its heyday of more than 1,100
properties with 150,000 rooms.
   The company said it needed the proceeds to reduce bank
debt, which had increased to about $350 million as result of
Prime's expansion strategy.
   The expansion, however, came in a period of tight
financing and softness in the hotel and real estate markets.
Also, its financial woes were exacerbated by the inability of
FCD Hospitality Inc. to pay back its debt to Prime. Last
year, FCD borrowed $200 million from Prime to purchase
Servico, a hotel operator, from Southmark Corp.
   Following Friday's announcement, Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered its ratings on Prime's convertible
subordinated debentures to Caa from Ba-3. Another credit
rating concern, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said it downgraded
its rating on Prime's subordinated debt to single-C from
single-B-minus. A rating of C indicates that a default on the
debt is imminent, S&amp;P said.

   PRIME MOTOR INNS Inc. said bank lenders were considering
extending the maturity date of existing loans and allowing
the company to retain a part of proceeds from asset sales.
Yesterday's edition incorrectly said lenders had agreed to
the extension and to the sharing of proceeds.
