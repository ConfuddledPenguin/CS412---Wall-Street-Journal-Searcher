   LUBBOCK, Texas -- Unit holders of Furr's/Bishop's
Cafeterias L.P. would become stockholders of a public company
if they accept an exchange offer by general partner Cavalcade
&amp; Co. Inc., in yet another conversion of a master limited
partnership to corporate ownership.
   Furr's/Bishop's 20,000 public limited partners would
receive 75 cents in cash, six-tenths of a share of $9
convertible preferred stock, and one-fourth of a share of
common stock for each partnership unit they own. Cavalcade
Chairman Michael J. Levenson beneficial owner of 41% of the
partnership, would exchange his units for common stock
representing 61% of the new publicly held Furr's/Bishops.

   Public unit holders would have the right to sell 56% of
their common-share holdings back to the company at $5 per
share aproximately four months after the exchange.
Approximately six months after the exchange, the preferred
shares can be exchanged for $10.88 in common equities in
Furr's/Bishops.
   Mr. Levenson's stake in Furr's/Bishop's would increase to
72% if all of the common stock is sold back. He would be
diluted to 52% if all of the preferred shares are converted
to common. Mr. Levenson declined to put a value on his offer
for the public units, which closed Friday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading unchanged at $5.375.
   Apache, NRM, Devon Energy already have abandoned MLPs in
favor of share ownership. Existing MLPs were grandfathered
for 10 years in a 1987 law that wiped out their tax
advantages. On Wall Street, MLP prices almost always
reflected yield calculations of their distributions.
   Furr's/Bishop's paid out $22 million in the 12 months
ending June 30. Mr. Levenson said Furr's/Cavalcade would have
paid $7.2 million in dividends for the period had it been
owned by preferred and common shareholders.
   Furr's/Bishop's wants to use retained profits for
expansion and renovation, Mr. Levenson said. "Partnerships
served their purpose," Mr. Levenson said. "Tax laws change
and markets change. We feel we need the money for other
purposes."
