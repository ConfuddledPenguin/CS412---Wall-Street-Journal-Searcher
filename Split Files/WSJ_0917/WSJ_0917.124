   Two Ernst &amp; Young partners were appointed as receivers to
manage Northern Star Holdings Ltd., an Australian television
network operator.
   Ernst &amp; Young said the partners, James Millar and Robert
Dunn, were appointed at the request of Northern Star and its
three major banks, Westpac Banking Corp., Commonwealth
Banking Corp. and Citicorp.

   The banks are owed more than 400 million Australian
dollars (US$330.8 million), mostly to Westpac. Steve Cosser,
Northern Star chief executive officer, said the receivership
arrangement was made in cooperation with the three banks.
   Westpac said that subject to the receivers'
investigations, the banks propose to provide continued
financial support so the Channel Ten network operated by
Northern Star can recover.
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns about 5% of Northern
Star. Britain's Daily Mail &amp; General Trust Group PLC has
14.5% and Thames Television PLC holds 10%.
   Two of Australia's three commercial TV networks now are in
receivership.
