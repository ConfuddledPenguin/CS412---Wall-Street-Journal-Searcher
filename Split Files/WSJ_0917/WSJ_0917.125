   An appeals court in Illinois has ruled that in-house
lawyers can sue companies that have fired them in retaliation
for giving unwanted advice.
   The ruling, by the Appellate Court of Illinois, is
believed to be among the first to give staff lawyers the
right to sue employers for retaliatory discharge. The case
had been closely watched by in-house lawyers and legal ethics
experts because courts in Illinois and Texas had ruled that
in-house lawyers could not sue employers.

   The case involves Roger J. Balla, an in-house lawyer fired
in 1985 by Gambro Inc., a distributor of kidney dialysis
equipment. Before he was fired, Mr. Balla had told the
company that a shipment of dialyzers was "misbranded and/or
adulterated," according to the court opinion.
   A lower court ruled that Mr. Balla could not pursue his
retaliatory discharge claim against Gambro, now based in
Lakewood, Colo., its German parent and Swedish affiliate. But
the appeals court said that Mr. Balla could pursue his claim,
even though other courts had refused to allow in-house
attorneys to sue on such grounds "fearing that the attorneys
would breach their fiduciary duty by disclosing their
client's confidential information."
   "The sanctity of the attorney-client privilege is not an
absolute bar to disclosure," the court ruled, when "public
policies" or "serious bodily harm" are at stake.
   Mr. Balla's suit against Gambro will be heard by a lower
court.
   Arthur Sternberg, the Chicago lawyer who represents
Gambro, said his client will seek to appeal. He said the
decision makes in-house lawyers "second-class citizens"
because it will encourage companies to limit their "use of
in-house attorneys to more mundane types of tasks rather than
putting them in sensitive situations." He said the dialyzers
were "not defective in any way."
   Alan O. Amos, the Chicago lawyer for Mr. Balla, said the
decision shows that in-house lawyers have "the same rights
that any other employee would have under the same
circumstances." He said the decision will discourage
companies from hiding behind the attorney-client privilege.
   The American Corporate Counsel Association (ACCA), a trade
group, has taken the position that in-house lawyers should
not be able to sue their employers, according to board member
Lawrence A. Salibra. But ACCA will consider the issue again
at its annual meeting in November, said Mr. Salibra, senior
counsel at Alcan Aluminium Corp.

   SEC DROPS BID for spot on Drexel creditors' committee.
   Instead, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
aligned itself with a court-sanctioned group of
securities-litigation claimants suing Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.
   The SEC moved to join the creditors' committee soon after
Drexel filed for bankruptcy-law protection on Feb. 13. The
SEC is owed $150 million as part of Drexel's settlement of
charges against the company last year. Although that claim
makes the SEC one of Drexel's largest creditors, the motion
sparked controversy because of a dispute over whether
bankruptcy law allowed a regulatory agency to serve in that
role.
   Now, however, the SEC says its interests are better
represented through the newly formed securities litigation
claimants group. The group will negotiate with Drexel and the
creditors' committee over how to provide for litigation
claims in the company's bankruptcy reorganization plan. More
than 400 suits are pending against Drexel.
   The group includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which is expected to file a huge claim against Drexel
stemming from the failure of several savings and loans. The
group also represents investors who have filed class-action
suits against Drexel and Michael Milken, the company's former
junk-bond chief. The group, which isn't an official
bankruptcy committee, was approved in a court order by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III last month.
   Richard Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel, said
the agency joined the litigation group because of the
importance of addressing the eventual claims that Drexel will
have to pay. The SEC's $150 million claim is meant to be
distributed to investors who were hurt by alleged wrongdoing
by Drexel. In a reorganization plan for Drexel, the money
could be combined with other payments by Drexel to set up a
fund for litigation claimants.
   "This case can't progress toward a feasible reorganization
plan" until an estimate is reached on the litigation claims,
Mr. Kirby said.
   In court filings, Drexel and the creditors' committee
agreed to negotiate with the litigation group to develop a
process for estimating the claims. They also said they will
include the group in negotiating a reorganization proposal.

   CRAVATH HAS LOST General Development Corp. as a client.
   Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, a New York law firm, and the
troubled Miami real-estate developer said the parting of ways
was mutual and had been planned since the spring. In the 13
months ended April 30, the company paid Cravath $4.8 million,
the law firm said.
   General Development was indicted in March on federal
felony charges of defrauding thousands of home buyers and was
subsequently placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.
Some critics, including Miami Beach attorney Paul Steinberg,
who represents certain General Development shareholders,
assert that Cravath ought to be held liable for advising
General Development that its marketing practices were legal
and sound.
   Meanwhile, two General Development directors said they
will call for an independent review of Cravath's legal
representation to assess whether the law firm acted
responsibly. The directors -- Chairman Charles J. Simons and
Chesterfield Smith -- said they are not alleging impropriety,
but rather feel an independent investigation is a sound
fiduciary move in light of criticism of Cravath.
   Ronald Rolfe, a Cravath partner, said "We think Cravath
has no liability or potential liability at all." Paul Dodyk,
who was Cravath's lead counsel for the company, declined to
comment.
   Mr. Smith, whose Miami law firm, Holland &amp; Knight, is
slated to succeed Cravath as lead counsel, said "it is in the
interest of all concerned to ascertain if the allegations are
substantial or insubstantial." The company's board hasn't yet
formally considered an independent inquiry, which would
review the roles of all involved parties -- not just Cravath,
Mr. Simons said.
   General Development had a close relationship with Cravath;
its former chairman, David F. Brown, who is facing federal
fraud charges, was a former associate at the firm and then
became general counsel to City Investing, a Cravath client,
before going to General Development.
   Cravath will continue representing the company in three
matters, it said.

   STATE JUDGE REJECTS ethics charges against a chemical
firm's lawyers.
   Travelers Indemnity Co. of Hartford had alleged that
lawyers for Stauffer Chemical Co. tried to prevent potential
witnesses from testifying in a suit concerning who should pay
for a cleanup of toxic waste.
   The company named in the suit is now a unit of ICI
Americas Inc., of Wilmington, Del., and is called Stauffer
Management Co. A company currently called Stauffer Chemical
Co. is not involved.
   The Travelers Corp. unit, a plaintiff, alleged Stauffer
lawyers violated ethics rules when they sent letters urging
former employees to call Stauffer lawyers at the Wilmington
law firm of Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp; Tunnell, the Washington
law firm of Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, or the Philadelphia law
firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius if they were contacted by the
insurance companies.
   In a ruling last week, Judge Vincent J. Poppiti of
Wilmington wrote that Travelers failed to prove that the
letters prevented the insurer from obtaining information that
would otherwise be available. He said he would refer the
matter to counsel for a lawyers' disciplinary board.
Stauffer's lawyers declined to comment.
   In a separate order, Judge Poppiti wrote that Jeffrey A.
Januzzo and Pamela G. Ostrager, lawyers at the New York firm
of Coudert Brothers, which is representing Travelers, had
misled him about the practices of investigators working on
behalf of the insurer. Stauffer had alleged that the
investigators failed to properly identify themselves to
former employees. The judge terminated the lawyers' right to
appear before the court.
   The Coudert lawyers declined to comment. In a prepared
statement, Mark Lebow, head of Coudert's litigation
department, said, "Two of the most respected ethics experts
in this country, Professor Stephen Gillers of New York
University and Professor Geoffrey Hazard of Yale University,
filed affidavits with the Delaware court attesting that the
conduct of the Coudert Brothers lawyers was ethical." A
Travelers spokesperson said they would appeal.
   Judge Poppiti also ordered Travelers to turn over to
Stauffer any statements obtained from former Stauffer
employees and said they would not be admissible at the trial,
set for February 1991.

   PENNY-STOCK INVESTIGATION NETS three more F.D. Roberts
officers.
   Three former owners of F.D. Roberts Securities Inc. last
week pleaded guilty to federal felony charges in connection
with their roles in a high-pressure penny-stock scam.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Newark obtained guilty pleas
from Fred Galiardo, former F.D. Roberts board chairman; Alan
Lieb, former vice president in charge of trading and a
director; and John Perfetti, a former vice president in
charge of trading and a director. The three are among the 25
F.D. Roberts brokers and officers who have either pleaded
guilty or been convicted on charges stemming from the
two-year federal investigation.
   The three pleaded guilty to federal racketeering,
securities, mail fraud and wire fraud charges. Mr. Galiardo
and Mr. Lieb face maximums of 20 years in prison and fines
equal to twice their gain or their victims' loss and
restitution. Mr. Perfetti faces 10 years in prison and a
maximum of $100 million in fines.
   James Galdieri, Mr. Lieb's attorney, said that his client
"accepts full responsibility for his wrong act." A lawyer for
Mr. Perfetti declined to comment. Mr. Galiardo's lawyer could
not be reached.

   CRIME BILL: The U.S. Senate passed an amendment sponsored
by U.S. Senator Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) and U.S. Senator
Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would require all
post-secondary education institutions that receive federal
aid to publish annual security reports that include the
number of violent crimes committed against students. The
report would be distributed to students and university
employees. Prospective applicants could receive the
information upon request. The drive to improve campus
security has been spearheaded by Connie and Howard Clery, a
Bryn Mawr, Pa., couple whose daughter was murdered by a
fellow student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa.
