   PUEBLO, Colo. -- CF&amp;I Steel Corp., a diversified
steelmaker, said it wasn't able to make a $12.3 million
payment to its pension trust fund as required last Saturday.
CF&amp;I said it has been talking for some time with the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. and the United Steelworkers of America
about the company's unfunded pension liability.
   CF&amp;I also said it is seeking investors to upgrade its
production facilities.
