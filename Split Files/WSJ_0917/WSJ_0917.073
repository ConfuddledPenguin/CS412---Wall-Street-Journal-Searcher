   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange extended its trading
session to move close to 24-hour trading of foreign currency
options.
   The new hours that began last night will allow traders
around the world to execute trades on foreign currency
options on the exchange for a total of 18 hours a day, or 19
hours during the standard-time portion of the year.

   Joseph Rizzello, senior vice president of the Philadelphia
exchange, says that by going to the longer hours, exchange
officials "hope to bring some of the over-the-counter
currency option business done in Tokyo and in other Far
Eastern financial centers to the exchange."
   The exchange's foreign currency option session now starts
each night, Sunday through Thursday, at 7 p.m. and goes to 11
p.m. The exchange then closes until 12:30 a.m. to reflect the
hour-and-a-half lunch break that Tokyo traders take. Trading
then continues, without interruption, until 2:30 p.m. Once
daylight savings time ends, the evening session will begin at
6 p.m. go to 10 p.m. and then resume at 11:30 p.m.
   Previously, the daylight savings time session would halt
between 11 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
   "I don't expect to see a huge increase in volume
initially, but as our customers gain knowledge of this avenue
of trading, they will begin to make use of it," says Jack
Regan, a vice president in the derivative products group at
LIT America Inc. in New York. LIT already has a 24-hour
trading desk to service mainly institutional customers around
the world. It trades around the clock by directing orders to
dealers and exchanges in the U.S., Europe and Asia, depending
on the hour.
   Mr. Regan adds that he eventually expects all the major
markets to offer 24-hour trading.
   This is the third time the Philadelphia exchange has
extended its trading hours. In September 1987, the exchange
introduced an evening session to accommodate increasing
demand for foreign currency options from the Far East. In
January 1989, the exchange added an early morning session
starting at 4:30 a.m. to attract European business.
   On its foreign currency trading floor, the exchange trades
options on cash currencies for the Australian dollar, British
pound, Canadian dollar, German mark, European Currency Unit,
French franc, yen and Swiss franc. Total dollar volume daily
on these contracts represents about $2 billion in underlying
value.
   Currency options give their holders the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell currencies at a specific price on
or before a certain date.
   Nicholas Giordano, president and chief executive of the
Philadelphia exchange, said the extended hours that began
last night are intended primarily to reach market users in
Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and other financial
centers in the Pacific Rim.
   Jeffrey Mondschein, managing director for Continental Bank
in Chicago, says he welcomes the longer hours offered by the
exchange. "I run a night desk here until midnight currently,"
he says. "Anything that provides additional liquidity during
the night time hours may be useful." Mr. Mondschein expects
exchanges with extended hours to become more useful to
professional traders who must lay off risk during
non-daylight hours.
   According to the Philadelphia exchange's Mr. Rizzello, the
exchange has considered going to a 24-hour trading day but
sees two significant problems with doing so.
   First, the exchange still needs a period of time to clear
or process trades that have been executed. But Mr. Rizzello
notes, "Someday, there will be `real-time' processing of
trades and that will make 24-hour trading much easier." Mr.
Rizzello also points out there are some hours -- late
afternoon in the Eastern time zone -- when there does not
appear to be very much business being done anywhere in the
world, so it makes little sense for the exchange to be open
then.
   Mr. Rizzello admits that it will take time to develop
substantial business during the longer hours, but he points
out that during periods of active trading, the extended hours
pay off. "On Sunday night after the October 1989 {stock
market} crash, we did 38,000 contracts before the day session
began." He also notes that the exchange is now studying the
possibility of trading options on both German and French
stock indexes during the extended hours.
   "While other exchanges are talking about 24-hour trading,"
says Mr. Giordano, the exchange president, "we are doing it."
