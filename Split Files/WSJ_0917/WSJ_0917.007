   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union continued contract talks late Sunday evening,
after the union agreed to keep working past a Friday night
strike deadline.
   It was only the second time in its history that the UAW
postponed a walkout after the expiration of a Big Three
contract. In 1987, the union extended its contract with Ford
Motor Co. for three days before reaching agreement.

   This time, the UAW agreed to keep talking with GM despite
failing to reach agreement by the deadline on its No. 1
issue: job security for its 310,000 active and laid-off GM
members.
   The union said it would continue working under the current
contract on a day-to-day basis. Union leaders told GM members
to report for their regular shifts until further notice. But
both sides clearly hoped to reach a settlement by this
morning.
   "We're inching along," UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said
yesterday afternoon. Top bargaining officials have kept a
tight lid on information about the talks, declining even to
give specific progress reports to local union leaders who are
expected to inform the rank and file. "Information has been
tight," said Robert Roman, an official of the 8,000-member
UAW unit in Flint, Mich., that represents GM's sprawling
Buick City auto complex. "I've never seen it like this in my
25 years of bargaining."
   In any case, pressure is mounting on top UAW bargainers to
reach an agreement that has stronger job security protections
than the current pact, or to spearhead a strike.
   The UAW's national bargaining council -- composed of local
union leaders from around the country -- is scheduled to meet
here this morning to discuss the union's options. If there is
no settlement, union officials could decide to keep talking
without a strike, go ahead with a nationwide walkout, or call
strikes at a few strategic GM plants that produce important
vehicles or parts.
   The UAW's decision to postpone a strike, despite the lack
of agreement on the crucial job-security question,
illustrates the dilemma the union faces as it tries to stop
further job losses at GM.
   In the past, when the UAW controlled virtually all U.S.
auto production, the union didn't hesitate to call for a
walkout if talks dragged on past a strike deadline. But now,
Japanese auto makers have eight U.S. factories -- five of
them non-union -- that would continue pumping out cars and
trucks if UAW members walked out. Ford and Chrysler Corp.
plants also would keep working.
   This glut of car-making capacity in the U.S. means sales
lost during a strike would likely be lost for good,
undermining the very GM jobs the UAW is seeking to protect.
   The job security issue is both complex and critical to the
futures of both the UAW and GM.
   The union wants GM to guarantee jobs, or continued pay,
for all its current UAW workers. UAW leaders have been stung
during the past three years as GM moved to close six U.S.
assembly factories, despite language in the current UAW-GM
agreement that was supposed to forbid permanent plant
shutdowns.
   But GM has been reluctant to extend job guarantees to its
entire current workforce. That's because the No. 1 auto maker
needs to cut as many as 60,000 jobs from its blue-collar
payrolls in North America to match the productivity levels of
its rivals, company officials say.
   Instead of blanket job guarantees, GM is understood to
have offered sweeter pensions to encourage more UAW members
to retire. The company also has pushed for relaxation of
contract language that forces it to replace one of every two
UAW workers who leave. UAW leaders, however, are reluctant to
accept such a package, because it could lead to an exodus of
active members.
   While a strike would make it harder to resolve these
delicate issues, union leaders could come under pressure to
set a firm strike deadline if no deal is struck before
rank-and-file members stream back to GM plants this morning.
   Top UAW officials already are feeling some heat from
below. In response to pressure from dissident members, the
union said it will provide members with a complete copy of
any tentative agreement before a ratification vote. Normally,
the process of getting the contract approved by the
membership takes about two weeks.
