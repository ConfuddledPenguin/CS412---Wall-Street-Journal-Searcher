   MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said it flew 1.64 billion
revenue passenger miles in August, up 71% from 959 million
revenue passenger miles in the year-earlier period.
   Results for the earlier period were affected by a labor
strike at the carrier. A revenue passenger mile is one paying
passenger flown one mile.
