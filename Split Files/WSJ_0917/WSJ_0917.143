   CLEVELAND -- Plaintiffs won a $13.5 million libel suit in
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against the Cleveland
Plain Dealer.
   Former promoters of a car race called the Budweiser
Cleveland Grand Prix alleged that they were defamed by
stories in the newspaper in 1984, and followed up in 1985 and
1986. The plaintiffs sought $16 million in damages, including
$10 million in punitive damages.

   The $13.5 million verdict included $4.5 million in
compensatory damages and $9 million in punitive damages.
   A secretary for the paper's top news officials said the
Plain Dealer hadn't yet prepared a statement about the
verdict. Lawyers who represented the newspaper couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The articles said that Charles K. Newcomb and James H.
Foster had paid themselves nearly $1 million from race
proceeds for management fees, salaries, commissions, legal
and accounting fees, and equipment rental fees in violation
of the lease they had with the city, according to a story in
Thursday's Plain Dealer.
   Messrs. Newcomb and Foster and their company, C. K.
Newcomb &amp; Associates of Cleveland, sold the race to
businessman and former race car driver Roger Penske in 1985.
At that point the Plain Dealer became a co-sponsor.
   Plain Dealer lawyers had argued the articles were correct,
the newspaper reported. The Plain Dealer is part of the
Newhouse chain, which is owned by Advance Publications Inc.
