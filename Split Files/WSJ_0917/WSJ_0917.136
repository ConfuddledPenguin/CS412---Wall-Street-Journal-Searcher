   LOS ANGELES -- Jonathan D. Krane, 38, resigned as chairman
and chief executive officer of Management Company
Entertainment Group Inc. under pressure from board members
and creditors.
   Mr. Krane, who founded the independent movie production
company three years ago, was the subject of a front-page
article in this newspaper last Thursday. MCEG is in default
of more than $100 million in debt and its largest creditors
include the GE Capital unit of General Electric Co. and
Virgin Group Ltd., a U.K. company headed by Richard Bramson.

   A federal bankruptcy court judge granted MCEG a 10-day
extension Friday to respond to a creditor petition seeking to
force the company's movie unit into involuntary liquidation.
MCEG is continuing to negotiate a proposed reorganization
plan with creditors and potential investors that it hopes
will save it from the jaws of bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Under Mr. Krane's resignation agreement, people close to
the situation said Mr. Krane will receive one year's salary,
or $504,000, and a $100,000 producer fee for the completion
of "Look Who's Talking Too," the sequel. Mr. Krane has been
producing that movie for Tri-Star Pictures Inc., a unit of
Sony Corp. MCEG also absolved Mr. Krane of a $200,000 debt to
the company. Mr. Krane couldn't be reached for comment.
   MCEG said Raymond H. Godfrey Jr., president and chief
operating officer, will temporarily assume the additional
post of chief executive officer. Mr. Godfrey said that MCEG
intends to enter into a "management consulting agreement"
with an investor group headed by Norman Levy, a former vice
chairman of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
   Under one scenario, the investor group, which includes
Michael Tarr, a film maker, and Donald Tractenberg, a former
vice president of finance at Fox, would bring $10 million
into the company to complete six unfinished movies. Mr.
Godfrey said the proposed restructuring plan would include
additional infusions of capital from GE Capital and Virgin
Group. He also said GE Capital will make a loan of $3 million
today to provide working capital.
   MCEG was scheduled to meet with its bondholders today at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York to discuss the restructuring.
   When MCEG went public in August of 1987, Mr. Krane
received $500,000 in cash, 2.5 million common shares and
preferred shares redeemable for $1 million in 1992in exchange
for his talent management company. However, under his
resignation agreement, sources said MCEG has an option to buy
all of Mr. Krane's preferred shares for $100 instead of $1
million.
   MCEG common shares, which traded as high as $4.375 last
year, closed Friday at 40.625 cents in over-the-counter
trading.
