   TORONTO -- Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. said it is
negotiating long-term project financing for its Canary Wharf
real estate development in London, which eventually is
expected to cost about #4 billion ($7.53 billion).
   An Olympia &amp; York spokesman said two separate project
financings were under negotiation. He declined to describe
their size or possible terms. He said they wouldn't be used
to reduce the company's #500 million equity stake in the
project.

   Canary Wharf is an office project meant to be the
centerpiece of the world's biggest property development, the
commercial-residential Docklands redevelopment.
   Olympia &amp; York so far has sunk more than #1 billion into
Canary Wharf, which still isn't finished. The spokesman said
the loans under negotiation would be the first project
financings for the development.
   Developers normally fund the early stages of a development
with short-term construction loans, then refinance that debt
with longer-term loans that are secured by the project
itself.
   Such project loans may be further guaranteed by the
developer, or may be nonrecourse loans without such
guarantees. The spokesman declined to describe the degree of
exposure that Olympia &amp; York might have under the proposed
financings.
   Canary Wharf has had trouble attracting tenants, which
could pose financial uncertainty for Olympia &amp; York, which is
owned by Toronto's Reichmann family. A first phase of 4.3
million square feet is to open next year, but only about half
the space has been rented.
   The Olympia &amp; York spokesman said the company remains
firmly committed to the project. He said its #500 million
equity investment "will remain in place at least until the
project is entirely completed."
