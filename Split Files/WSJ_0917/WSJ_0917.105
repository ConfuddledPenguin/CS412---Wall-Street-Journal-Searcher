   The New York Mercantile Exchange's new futures contract
for natural gas is turning out to be the most successful
commodity-trading vehicle launched in seven years.
   "Most people in the futures industry have assumed that
growth will continue to come from the financial products.
This contract shows that the potential for growth is much
broader-based," says Thomas Russo, a former attorney at the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission and now a partner at
Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft in New York.

   The contract made its debut in early April, and after five
months daily volume averaged nearly 515 contracts and the
number of contracts outstanding exceeded 9,600. On Aug. 3,
the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, a record 2,070 contracts
were traded.
   This performance compares favorably with crude oil
futures, which are now the most heavily traded commodity in
the country; only two U.S. futures markets are bigger, and
they are based on financial instruments -- U.S. Treasury
bonds and Eurodollars. Five months after crude oil futures
began trading in 1983, average daily volume was greater than
that for natural gas, 795 contracts, but fewer contracts --
about 6,300 -- were outstanding.
   Nobody expects the new natural gas contract to overtake
crude oil, whose average daily volume of more than 90,000
contracts shot up to more than 120,000 last month. (The
Treasury bond contract on the Chicago Board of Trade averages
more than 300,000 contracts a day, and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's Eurodollar contract averages more than 130,000.)
   One New York Merc official says he thinks that within five
years natural gas could become one of the five most actively
traded contracts in the world. But until then, several other
exchange officials say they'd be happy if natural gas matches
the activity in the Merc's heating oil contract, which this
year is averaging more than 24,000 contracts daily.
   Key to the contract's successful start is that the gas
industry likes the contract and is using it. In late August,
85% of those holding 25 or more contracts overnight were in
the natural gas business in one way or another, the Merc
says.
   "We use it regularly to hedge our positions and
commitments," says Douglas Schantz, vice president for gas
supply at Transco Energy Marketing Co., a Houston marketer
that acts as middleman between some producers and users.
Recently, he says, Transco Energy has been a selling hedger
-- that is, one that sells contracts short to protect
inventory or gas purchases against falling prices. (If the
company wanted to protect itself against rising prices, it
would buy futures.) Mr. Schantz notes that the company
routinely carries out both types of transactions depending
upon its hedging needs.
   Greg Kane, chief financial officer of a New Jersey
exploration and drilling company, says he never doubted the
contract would succeed because natural gas prices are
volatile: The price of the soonest-expiring contract has
swung 22% from high to low since futures trading began after
the winter heating season was over. "It's just a matter of
time before all major participants in the industry become
users of the contract," he predicts.
   And with petroleum supplies in question, a cold winter
could cause trading volume and volatility in the contract to
explode, Mr. Kane says. He considers the coming heating
season to be the ultimate test of the contract's viability.
   Lance Schneier, chairman and chief executive officer of
Access Energy Corp., a Dublin, Ohio, company that markets gas
to 4,500 customers in 30 states, has been a big booster of
the contract. His company offers several new products that
permit customers to fix their buying or selling prices based
on futures prices. In one arrangement, Access places a quote
screen in a customer's office. If the customer sees a price
for a futures month that he likes, he can arrange to buy or
sell from Access at that price plus some differential.
   "He can lock up one month's gas or as many months as he
wants based on what he sees on the screen," Mr. Schneier
says. When a customer makes a commitment, Access hedges the
position in the futures market.
   Some market observers were surprised that gas prices
didn't react much to Middle East tensions. But Mr. Schneier
points out, "Many customers with the ability to switch from
oil to gas started switching before the Iraqi invasion,
causing gas prices to increase in July." He adds that now
with a futures contract for gas, it's easy to see gas prices
move largely on their own. "Oil is an international commodity
while natural gas is a domestic one," he explains.
   The way this industry operates also affects prices, says
Jacob Ulrich, general manager for energy trading at the
Natural Gas Clearing House in Houston, the largest
independent U.S. marketer of natural gas, handling 2.3
billion cubic feet a day. He says his firm uses futures not
only to hedge but also to speculate "if we think futures look
cheap or dear."
   Mr. Ulrich points out that end-users of gas want to fix
the price of their gas needs as early in the heating season
as possible, while producers want to wait as late as they
can, hoping for a price bulge. At this point in the year,
"Most of the marketers of gas have made commitments to
deliver gas but they don't yet own sufficient gas to meet
their obligations," Mr. Ulrich says. "This could lead to a
very bullish situation for futures."
   But the other element of a successful futures contract --
active participation by speculators -- hasn't shown up in
natural gas. "Speculators want action, and the action is in
crude oil," says Robert Baker, energy futures analyst at
Prudential-Bache in New York. Fewer than 2% of those holding
positions of 25 contracts or more overnight are speculators,
according to the Merc. That figure understates speculative
participation because many short-term speculators, known as
"locals," close out their positions daily, and their trading
doesn't show up in position reports.
   "With the hedgers using the contract, we will ultimately
be interested in it," says Keith Campbell, president of
Campbell &amp; Co., a Baltimore commodity trading adviser with
$120 million under management. He says he prefers trading
contracts that have at least three years of price data, but
"if we see the right kind of price movement, we might trade
it sooner."
   Robert Tamiso, a New York adviser who manages about $15
million of private pool money, says he would consider trading
the contract after 120 days of trading data have built up,
which will occur by the end of September. "This is going to
be a successful contract for {speculators} and there is no
question we are going to be trading it," he says.
