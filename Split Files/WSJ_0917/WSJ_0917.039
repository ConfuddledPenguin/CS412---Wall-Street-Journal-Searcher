   TINTON FALLS, N.J. -- Concurrent Computer Corp., a
computer systems supplier, said it won't make an interest
payment of about $4.7 million due Sept. 15 to holders of its
senior subordinated notes, due 1998.
   The company has retained the investment banking firm
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help with a restructuring. Concurrent
has $55 million in senior bank debt and about $110 million in
subordinated debt outstanding. On Sept. 28, an additional $15
million of principal and $1.7 million of interest on the bank
debt are due.

million restructuring provision. Last week, the company named
Denis R. Brown vice chairman, president and chief executive
officer to lead the restructuring effort.
