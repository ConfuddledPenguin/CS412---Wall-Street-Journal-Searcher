   PARIS -- Eurocom S.A., the large French ad agency, is
negotiating a restructuring and possible breakup of the HDM
international ad agency network that it owns with Young &amp;
Rubicam Inc. of the U.S. and Japan's Dentsu Inc.
   "For some time we have been holding discussions on the
relative ownership of HDM," says John Cooper, Young &amp;
Rubicam's general counsel.

   So far, however, the restructuring talks haven't produced
results.
   "Our joint venture agreement says that any changes require
unanimous agreement," explains Mr. Cooper. "We have discussed
all sorts of possibilities."
   Insiders familiar with the talks say they could lead to
each partner buying the others out in its own region. Eurocom
holds a majority of HDM in Europe, Young &amp; Rubicam holds a
majority in the U.S. and Dentsu holds a majority in Asia.
   HDM appears to be facing two kinds of problems. For
starters, Eurocom, which is the 43%-owned advertising
affiliate of French media giant Havas S.A., has changed its
international strategy since forming HDM in 1987. Instead of
pursuing alliances, it now wants to be an international
advertising power on its own.
   Last year, Eurocom created its own international network
by acquiring 60% control of London-based WCRS Group PLC's
advertising operations, whose assets include Della Femina
McNamee WCRS of the U.S. To compete with ad elephants such as
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. and WPP Group PLC, Eurocom feels it
must grow still bigger and more international.
   It wants to make HDM a more energetic world-wide agency,
by growing in the U.S. with or without Young &amp; Rubicam. "We
want Young &amp; Rubicam to make a push to buy new agencies or
otherwise make HDM bigger in the U.S.," says a Eurocom
official. "If this doesn't happen we must take another look
at things."
   So far, HDM's U.S. performance has been weak, and that is
its second big problem. According to Advertising Age, HDM's
1989 gross margin (a measure of revenue) was $231.4 million
in Europe, $106.1 million in Asia and Australia, and $30.2
million in the U.S.
   A Eurocom spokesman says it and Young &amp; Rubicam have
agreed on a deadline for improving HDM's U.S. results. If the
deadline isn't met, the spokesman says, they will "envisage a
change." The Eurocom official wouldn't specify the deadline.
   Young &amp; Rubicam says it is trying. "We have agreed with
them for some time that Young &amp; Rubicam will lend its efforts
to improving things in the U.S.," says Mr. Cooper. "That
means creating a larger agency." But he says, "The U.S.
market isn't easy." While Young &amp; Rubicam has looked for more
than a year for a U.S. acquisition for HDM, he says, "Nothing
is imminent."
   People involved in the talks say hopes of saving the joint
venture look bleak. One of them compares the talks to divorce
negotiations, and says a central sticking point is simply
money.
   Eurocom feels that, since it created most of HDM's
revenue, it shouldn't have to pay Young &amp; Rubicam or Dentsu
much to buy them out. Young &amp; Rubicam has told Eurocom that
it has made a big effort in the U.S., which is a tougher,
slower-growing market than Europe. Since any agreement must
be unanimous, the divorce talks are dragging on.
   Eurocom says it already is looking for U.S. acquisitions
itself, which it presumably could use to expand either HDM or
its own WCRS-based network, which it has renamed EWDB.
Advertising sources say that earlier this year, Eurocom
approached Saatchi &amp; Saatchi about buying its Backer
Spielvogel Bates subsidiary, based on the old Ted Bates
network.
   "BSB isn't for sale," says a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spokesman.
"We are financially secure. We don't have to sell anything we
don't want to sell, and we don't want to sell BSB."
   HDM's roots are in a 20-year-old Asian cooperation
arrangement between Dentsu and Young &amp; Rubicam. Eurocom and
Young &amp; Rubicam then formed their own joint venture in 1985,
and in 1987 Dentsu was officially added, to create the
current structure.

   Hirst Leaves Saatchi
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. said W. Jonathan T. Hirst resigned
as president and chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Holdings (USA), the holding company for Saatchi's U.S.
interests.
   The company said only that Mr. Hirst, 41 years old, left
the company "to pursue other career interests." A spokesman
denied industry speculation that Mr. Hirst, a longtime
Saatchi executive who was appointed president just a year and
a half ago, was forced out in a cost-cutting move.
   He will be succeeded by Martin Tucker, 67, who was
formerly general counsel for the U.S. holding company. No one
has been named to succeed Mr. Tucker as general counsel.
   Mr. Hirst, who has worked on efforts to sell Saatchi's
consulting businesses, will continue to act as a consultant
to complete the previously announced sale of Gartner Group,
one of the firm's former consulting units.
