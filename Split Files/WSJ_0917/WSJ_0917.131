   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Directors of the National Science
Foundation dismissed Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
appeal of the decision to establish the new national magnet
center at Florida State University.
   The NSF's selection of the Florida school last month
shocked MIT, which has been home to the world's leading
magnet laboratory, and chagrined many scientists who worry
that access to top notch laboratory facilities in the U.S.
will be lost for several years while Florida State builds up
its lab.

   MIT said that its Francis Bitter National Magnet
Laboratory, the national laboratory since 1960, will have to
be closed. NSF is providing $6 million in annual funding
through next year. But with the laboratory going to Florida,
researchers are likely to drift away from MIT and may
postpone long-term projects until the new lab is established.
   MIT has orchestrated a major letterwriting campaign by
scientists who use the laboratory and has been sharply
critical of the NSF for choosing Florida State, which will be
building a laboratory from scratch. However, the state of
Florida has committed $58 million to building the center and
NSF officials questioned the commitment of MIT to the project
in picking Florida.
   Friday, the NSF board of directors reaffirmed its earlier
decision saying it will "best maintain the long-term health
and vitality," of magnet research.
