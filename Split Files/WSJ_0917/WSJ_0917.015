   If you're like me, you're glad that environmentalism has
become chic. All those gala champagne soirees for the
protection of the rain forest have definitely raised my
consciousness. But who'd have guessed that ecology would
suddenly get so hot they'd inflict it on us as a weekly
dramatic action series?
   "What in hell are we doing here?]" shouts a voice over an
image of the globe. Cut to a man on top of a factory
smokestack, screaming through a megaphone, "We're murdering
the planet] We're poisoning the atmosphere] We're killing the
skies] . . . It's got to stop]]" Then he unfurls a banner
that proclaims "Recycle" and flings himself off the
smokestack.

   So begins "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (CBS, Saturdays, 9 p.m. EDT),
a show whose heart is certainly in the right place, but whose
mind is somewhere else altogether. Here's the basic premise:
A fiendish villain infiltrates a nuclear plant to steal
plutonium, and sabotages the cooling system. Meltdown is 36
hours away. The rich industrialist who owns the plant decides
to assemble a crack squad of scientists, doctors and
pollution experts to combat the threat (the first of many
adventures). Sound familiar? Like an environmental A-Team,
perhaps? Just think of this show as "Mission: Recyclable."
   If there's any fundamental improbability to calmly pulling
together a crisis-containment group from all over the globe
just hours before nuclear disaster, you wouldn't know it from
this show. And once all the members are assembled, with the
clock ticking toward ecological catastrophe, what do they do?
Sit down for an elegant, leisurely dinner, of course. Makes
sense to me. Then the team rushes to the site and, with
seconds left, saves the day.
   But wait] The danger isn't over yet. There's still a whole
second hour needed to track down the villain and wrest the
plutonium from his evil hands.
   Since "E.A.R.T.H. Force" lacks the clever, intricate
plotting of a "Mission: Impossible," at least you could hope
for some of the quirky characters of an "A-Team." Instead,
writers and executive producers Richard Chapman and Bill Dial
offer up a bunch of self-righteous do-gooders, certainly one
of the most sanctimonious, humorless groups ever assembled on
the small screen: a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a marine
biologist and an anthropologist.
   This Clean Team is given to railing at everyone in sight.
As they face assorted menaces over the coming weeks, their
deadliest weapon is sure to be their loquacity: "Maybe he
discovered something more important, more important than man
and his ambition, or his need to control the world around
him, to play with it like a spoiled child tinkers with his
toy, until it breaks and he throws it away. {The music
swells.} We've lived on this planet for 50,000 years, and in
the last 200, we've damn near killed it."
   Finding himself behind bars, the physicist naturally
starts castigating his fellow jailbirds for throwing
Styrofoam cups on the floor of the prison: "This is our
environment here," he scolds. "The Parthenon is in ruins;
plastic is forever." And when team members argue with each
other, their insults are lines like: "I've got two Ph.D.s and
an honorary degree from Oxford."
   So when, at the end of this premiere, the team looks
somberly at the camera and announces, "It's a big world out
there, and most of it's asleep. What the hell -- maybe we can
wake it up," you know most of the audience will be snoozing.
   Frankly, an issue as important as the destruction of the
planet deserves a better show. I'm all for attacking
pollution, but what about pollution of the airwaves? Save the
planet? They should have saved their breath.

   This week marks the official beginning of the 1990-91
television season, and luckily there are at least a couple of
shows with some potential. Two action dramas rooted solidly
in character are "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (CBS, Mondays,
10 p.m. EDT) and "Gabriel's Fire" (ABC, Thursdays, 9 p.m.
EDT).
   "Trials" teams up two "Cagney and Lacey" alums, producer
Barney Rosenzweig and actress Sharon Gless. At first, this
show may appear to be a cut-rate "L.A. Law," with Ms. Gless
as a public defender, wheeling and dealing with the
prosecutor in the courthouse bathroom. But quickly it becomes
clear that Mr. Rosenzweig's plan is to vamp in the vein of
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," to focus not solely on
Rosie O'Neill, lawyer, but Rosie O'Neill, newly divorced
43-year-old, private-school-educated child of privilege who
gave up her corporate practice when her marriage collapsed.
Now she works in the P.D.'s office, but parks her Mercedes
five blocks from the office because she feels guilty about
owning it.
   So far, "Trials" is a full-blooded portrait of a feisty,
hard-charging woman, full of convictions and full of doubts.
She's got a black office mate who isn't thrilled to see her
(he thinks she's slumming) and a mother who can't understand
her choice: "This isn't law; it's street cleaning. You
graduated fifth in your class in law school so you could work
for the sanitation department?"
   So Rosie sits in the dark at her house, eating ice cream
and worrying: "Does my neck look crepey? . . . I wonder when
he decided he didn't love me anymore . . ." But she also has
a nice acerbic edge too, especially when talking about the
woman her husband left her for: "How is Bridget? What is she,
12 now?"
   Although Ms. Gless occasionally wanders over the top as
Rosie, she's creating a good, strong character. For the fans
of Cagney, this should be a treat.
   ---
   Another treat -- a positive joy -- is that James Earl
Jones has finally emerged from under that Darth Vader helmet,
and made it to the small screen in "Gabriel's Fire." As
Gabriel Bird, an ex-con tasting freedom for the first time in
20 years, Mr. Jones was wonderful in the pilot last week, by
turns phlegmatic, confused, exultant. So far, the plotting of
the show looks fairly standard-issue, with Gabriel working
for a female yuppie lawyer as her detective in the coming
episodes, but Mr. Jones positively fills the screen with his
towering voice, his monumental presence. This is clearly the
best acting of the season. Yes, "E.A.R.T.H. Force," the vast
wasteland can be reclaimed . . . More in future columns.
