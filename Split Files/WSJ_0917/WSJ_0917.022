   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department said any sugar
imported into the U.S. beyond a nationwide total of 1,725,000
metric tons will be subject to higher tariffs during the year
starting Oct. 1.
   At the same time, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
announced how much sugar each country could send here at the
current, relatively low tariff rate.

   The twin announcements put into effect a new system of
sugar import restrictions. The U.S. is substituting higher
tariffs for strict numerical quotas. The change was prompted
by an international trade panel ruling last year that the old
system of import quotas violated the rules of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   U.S. trade-policy officials said the higher duties on
imports exceeding 1,725,000 metric tons effectively would
hold imports to that level. That would be up about 6.5% from
the level of imports allowed under the old quota system for
the year ending Sept. 30.
   The tariff on imports exceeding 1,725,000 will be 16 cents
per pound. Imports up to that annual limit will be subject to
the current duty of 0.625 cents per pound. In addition,
imports that come from a large group of developing nations
eligible for special tariff preferences under U.S. trade laws
will continue to be duty-free.
   The country-by-country allocations of sugar import quotas
by Mrs. Hills were based on the historical pattern of U.S.
sugar imports and were computed on the same basis as previous
quota allocations.
   As in the past, countries with the largest allocations
were the Dominican Republic (292,010 metric tons), the
Philippines (262,147 tons), and Brazil (240,578 tons).
   U.S. officials said the change to the so-called
tariff-rate quota system for sugar imports probably will have
little effect on domestic sugar prices, which are about 23
cents per pound, compared with world market prices of about
11 cents per pound.
