   LONDON -- Britain's retail price index in August rose 1%
from July and 10.6% from a year earlier, the Central
Statistical Office said, citing seasonal food prices, the
highest since February 1986.
   The year-to-year increase, which exceeded market
expectations for a 10.3% rise, was the highest since the 11%
advance in February 1982, and outstripped the 10.4% gain in
March 1982.

   The underlying level of inflation, which excludes mortgage
payments and community tax charges, was 7.9% in August,
compared with 7% in July. Certain mortgage costs and rising
fuel costs in Britain also contributed to the August advance
in inflation, the agency said. Fuel costs contributed 0.2
percentage point to the month-to-month rise. The end of
summer retail sales also contributed to the advance, as
retailers returned to higher-priced items.
