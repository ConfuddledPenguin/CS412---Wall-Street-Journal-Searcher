   OTTAWA -- A group of oil companies led by Mobil Oil Canada
Ltd. awarded $1.4 billion of contracts to international
engineering groups to build a giant production platform for
the Hibernia oil field off Canada's east coast.
   The concrete platform will be located in an area known as
Iceberg Alley and will be designed to withstand a direct
iceberg hit.

   The contracts were awarded Friday after Mobil and its
partners signed an agreement with the governments of Canada
and Newfoundland to undertake the $4.5 billion Hibernia
development.
   Doris Engineering of France, head of a group of companies,
received a $1.1 billion contract to construct the production
platform. A Canadian-European joint-venture led by SNC Group
Inc. of Montreal was awarded a $309.8 million contract for
engineering work.
   Canadian Energy Minister Jake Epp predicted Hibernia's
development would spur the development of other eastern
offshore oil fields including the Terra Nova, White Rose and
Ben Nevis fields.
   Hibernia, located off Newfoundland, contains between an
estimated 525 million and 650 million barrels of light, waxy
crude oil, most of which is expected to be shipped to oil
refineries in the U.S. Northeast. Production is expected to
begin in 1996 and continue for about 20 years. During the
peak production period in 1998, Hibernia is projected to
produce 110,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Mobil Oil Canada has a 28.1% stake in Hibernia. Its
partners include Gulf Canada Resources Inc., which is
controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, with 25%;
government-owned Petro-Canada with 25%; and Chevron Canada
Resources Ltd., a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
with 21.9%. Mobil Oil Canada is a unit of New York-based
Mobil Corp.
   Some industry analysts claimed the Hibernia project
wouldn't be economic without the heavy financial support of
the Canadian and Newfoundland governments.
   The Canadian government agreed to contribute $2.3 billion
in cash and loan guarantees toward Hibernia's development
costs. It also agreed to provide the consortium with
interest-free loans if oil prices fall below $25 a barrel. In
addition, the government said it would provide loans to cover
part of any capital cost overruns. It also agreed to forgo
any government revenues generated by Hibernia until the
consortium repays all of its outstanding loans.
   The Newfoundland government agreed to forgo some sales and
income taxes on the project.
   John O'Connor, president of Mobil Oil Canada, said
Canada's investment into Hibernia "is sound." He predicted
Canada "will get its loans back and more besides."
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said that in addition to
Hibernia, there is a "significant level of excitement" about
Terra Nova's prospects.
   Petro-Canada is expected to submit early next year its
plans to develop the Terra Nova field. The field, which is
located about 25 miles south of Hibernia, is estimated to
contain 300 million barrels of crude.
   Husky Oil Ltd. says it plans to drill a further three or
four delineation wells in the White Rose field, which is
expected to contain between 200 million and 300 million
barrels. Currently there is one well being drilled in the
eastern offshore region.
