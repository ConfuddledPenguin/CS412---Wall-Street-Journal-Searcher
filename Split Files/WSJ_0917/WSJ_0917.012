   Even as experts fret over the adequacy of future U.S.
petroleum supplies, the domestic oil industry has quietly
stepped up exports of gasoline.
   If the outflow continues, it could mean continued high
pump prices for U.S. motorists and tight supplies at the
wholesale level in the months ahead. That, in turn, could
create public-policy headaches for the government, which is
asking motorists to conserve gasoline, and for the oil
industry, already accused of price gouging in the current
crisis.

   Since the start of the Iraq-Kuwait oil embargo in early
August, shipments of gasoline out of the country -- mostly to
Europe -- have doubled or tripled from their skimpy rates of
recent years, according to numerous people familiar with or
involved in oil trading.
   There is nothing illegal or improper about such sales --
oil is one of the most widely traded world commodities. But
they do represent a "very, very significant abnormality from
trends of recent years," says Calvin Kent, head of the Energy
Department's Energy Information Administration.
   Gasoline is routinely imported into some major U.S.
markets because domestic refineries can't always satisfy
demand. And the small amounts of fuel exported usually go to
nearby countries for logistical reasons, although some
regularly goes to Japan.
   But now profit opportunities overseas have zoomed, with
European buyers offering $4 to $8 -- and at one point in
excess of $10 -- more per barrel for gasoline than the U.S.
market. A $4-per-barrel differential means $1 million of
additional profit on a typical tanker-load. As a result, one
oil company official says his company feels "considerable
pressure" to export. Like many oil industry people, he
wouldn't discuss exports unless given anonymity.
   No one knows yet exactly how much more U.S. gasoline is
going overseas in the wake of the Middle East crisis.
Government data on tanker exports lag behind by several
months because of an antiquated, century-old tracking system.
But industry people who attempt to measure such activities on
their own put the figure at 10 to 20 cargoes since early
August. "It's not an armada, but it has become a trend," says
Peter Gignoux, who heads the international trading desk for
Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.
   Philip Verleger, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics and a Treasury Department official
under President Carter, told a gathering of 35 congressmen
Thursday that exports "could be as much as 100,000 to 150,000
barrels a day for August" and early September.
   Such estimates suggest between 4.5 million and 6.75
million barrels of exports in the past 45 days. When compared
with government statistics, that would equal more than 30% of
all the gasoline exported for the full year of 1989. Gasoline
exports last year, according to the Energy Department's Mr.
Kent, averaged 39,000 barrels daily, with no more than 60,000
barrels a day exported in any one month.
   The increase in exports, coupled with a modest decline in
imports in recent weeks, could mean lean gasoline supplies in
the U.S. later this year unless demand falls significantly,
some industry and government analysts think. While demand is
off a bit now because of the softer economy, and inventories
have risen slightly in recent days, supplies still aren't
bountiful. As a result, the seasonal slump in retail pump
prices that normally follows the end of the summer driving
season may not occur this year, analysts say.
   In fact, motorists may even have to pay still more. "We're
struggling just to maintain our gasoline inventories now,"
says Ted Eck, chief economist for Amoco Corp. Adds Sarah
Emerson, analyst for Energy Security Analysis Inc.: "As long
as U.S. gasoline goes to Europe, supplies of that fuel will
remain tight."
   Mr. Kent of the Energy Department says he is haunted by a
sense of deja vu. "The situation bears watching," he says.
"Last year, good bits of propane were diverted to Europe
because prices were higher there. And when the weather turned
cold here, the U.S. was short that fuel."
   So far this year, gasoline demand in Europe has been
running 3.5% ahead of last year because of robust economies
and increased motor travel caused by the opening of Eastern
Europe. At the same time, European refiners are being
squeezed by the loss of large amounts of partially refined
Kuwaiti oil that was easily turned into gasoline. In part,
they are substituting some Saudi crudes that yield less
gasoline per barrel.
   So wholesale prices are much higher than in the U.S. On
some recent days, gasoline there fetched 10 cents to 20 cents
a gallon more than in the U.S; on one day, the gap was 32
cents.
   The full list of refiners taking advantage of such spreads
can't be determined. However, people involved with trading
identify at least five involved in recent transactions:
Phibro Energy, a unit of Salomon Inc.; BP North America Inc.,
a unit of the United Kingdom's British Petroleum Co.; Texaco
Inc.; Citgo Petroleum Corp., wholly owned by Venezuela, and
Kansas-based Koch Industries Inc.
   In response to questions, Phibro says only that it does
from "time to time export an odd cargo" of gasoline. It is
understood, however, that Phibro currently has a cargo going
to South America; it hasn't sent anything to Europe since
hostilities in the Persian Gulf began. BP confirms that it
has put together at least one cargo for Europe and that its
European arm is taking into its own system any exports that
it purchases. BP is also taking in U.S. gasoline in New
Zealand.
   Citgo says it has sent one cargo to Europe so far --
230,000 barrels of super premium unleaded. A Koch official
says that company sold one cargo to BP North America, but
says he doesn't know how BP used it. He also says Koch has
made sales to U.S. companies with refineries overseas, but
doesn't know what happened to the fuel after that. Texaco
confirms it sent one cargo of gasoline to supply customers of
its Pembroke refinery in Wales, which is down for
maintenance. It says the shipment doesn't reflect a
continuing program.
   While there is nothing wrong with such transactions, the
timing couldn't be worse for the oil industry. The Justice
Department is already investigating the sharp rise in
gasoline prices since the invasion of Kuwait. Now other
federal agencies are chasing information on exports,
including the Energy Department and, industry advisers say,
the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Most high-ranking oil officials are reluctant to discuss
the topic. "No doubt, it's an embarrassment," concedes one.
Adds another executive at a large U.S. oil company: "No
refiner in his right mind should export product right now.
Just one barrel, just one rowboat full -- the heat we'd take
from the feds would be immense."
   Those willing to defend exporting say it is merely the
free market at work. "We aren't taking gasoline from
Americans for the net benefit of the rest of the world,"
insists an official of a company making exports. "Demand for
gasoline is simply stronger in Europe than it has been here."
   Tom Burns, manager of economics for Chevron Corp., says:
"The market is allocating the gasoline to those who value it
most highly. This shouldn't be looked at in a moralistic way.
And if it is, well, we're just exporting to our allies who
need it." Mr. Burns says Chevron isn't exporting.
   The government could face an equally awkward
public-relations dilemma. Among the questions pondered at
last Thursday's closed-door congressional meeting was what
the public might think about oil being exported for profit
"while American husbands and sons go to the Saudi desert to
fight," says one attendee. Also, the government is in the
midst of kicking off a campaign calling on American motorists
to cut back on gasoline consumption.
   Some industry experts contend a schizophrenic U.S. energy
policy has inadvertently encouraged exports by creating a
two-tier global oil pricing system in which the U.S. trails.
The administration preaches the free market, even as it
imposes a subtle form of oil price control by having
officials call industry executives to urge restraint.
   And as the government struggles to set strategy, it
doesn't always take into account anomalies that can arise
within the market. For instance, analysts say, not all
oil-fed utilities and manufacturing plants in the U.S. should
be encouraged to stop using residual fuel oil in favor of
natural gas. If too much of that heavy fuel oil is shunned,
they argue, oil refineries will have to cut back on runs of
gasoline and heating oil. That is because they would be
swamped with unsold "resid" that is automatically produced at
the same time.
   "The government -- it just doesn't know how to connect the
dots," says Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation.
