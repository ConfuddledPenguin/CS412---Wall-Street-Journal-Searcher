   Nestle S.A. of Switzerland, a foods concern, said its
first-half net income declined 4.7% to 975 million Swiss
francs ($747.7 million) from 1.02 billion francs a year
earlier. Analysts had expected an increase.
   Consolidated cash flow rose 7.9% 1.98 billion francs.
Trading profit rose 9.8% to 2.21 billion francs. Consolidated
profit before taxes rose 12% to 1.8 billion francs. Net
income declined mainly because of an increase in taxes to 752
million francs from 611 million francs, and the negative
influence of currency rates, Nestle said.

   Nestle previously posted a first-half decline in group
sales to 22.7 billion francs from 22.8 billion francs.
   Nestle also said its outlook for the year is unclear,
owing to uncertainties about the political and economic
situation internationally and currency developments. Some
analysts had forecast an annual earnings rise of 3% to 10%
from 2.41 billion francs in 1989, but now view a decline of
5% as probable, mainly because of currency fluctuations and
higher-than-expected taxes.
