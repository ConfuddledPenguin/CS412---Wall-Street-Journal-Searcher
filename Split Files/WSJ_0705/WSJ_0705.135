   CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., a natural resources
concern, said it will report a third-quarter gain of $2.6
million, or 22 cents a share, from the completion of its
previously announced $3.9 million sale of a unit's interests
in Kentucky coal reserves. A year earlier, the company earned
$16.5 million, or $1.42 a share, on revenue of $95 million.
