   SOVIET HIJACKINGS

   A Soviet aviation minister said air piracy in the Soviet
Union was assuming a mass scale, with the hijacking of five
aircraft to foreign countries in three weeks.
   The hijackers "are young people between 17 and 20 who have
no experience of life," Deputy Civil Aviation Minister
Mikhail Timofeyev said. "We must make clear to them the
seriousness of such acts, so that they should never dream
that terrorism will go unpunished."
   Mr. Timofeyev said everything possible was being done to
stop this "wave of terrorist acts," including purchase of new
screening equipment for airports. He said five aircraft on
internal flights had been hijacked to Turkey, Sweden and
Finland since June 18, all by young people pretending to
carry guns or explosives.
   The minister denied that the hijackings took place because
tight travel laws gave the youths no other way to leave the
country. "Some will have got their ideas from video films and
some saw an element of heroism in it," he said.
                                                                                                       

   CUTTING JAPAN'S WORK HOURS
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese Labor Ministry has reportedly decided to
curtail the length of Japan's legal work week to 44 hours
from the current 46, beginning next April. A Japanese news
agency, quoting ministry sources, said the move is another
step toward the government's goal of reducing the annual
working time of the Japanese to 1,800 hours by fiscal 1992.
                                                                                                       

   WARNING FOR EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission warned East Germany not
to allow West German companies to set up monopolies, cartels
or similar arrangements with East German companies. In a
letter to East German Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl, Sir
Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, underscored
his worries that German companies may be trying to exclude
other EC companies from competing in a united Germany. He
specifically cited the takeover of the East German state
insurance monopoly by West German insurance giant Allianz AG.
                                                                                                       

   CANADIAN HELP FOR CHINA
                                                                                                       

   The Canadian government said it would lend up to 37.5
million Canadian dollars (US$32.2 million) to China for the
construction of a pulp and paper mill. Canadian Industrial
Consortium will supply equipment and engineering services for
the mill. The consortium includes such pulp- and
paper-equipment designers and builders as Ingersoll-Rand
Canada Inc., Dillingham Construction Ltd. and Societe de
Developpement Industriel du Quebec.
                                                                                                       

   NUCLEAR POWER FOR PILSEN?
                                                                                                       

   West Germany's Siemens AG is conducting a joint study to
determine the feasibility of building a nuclear-power plant
to provide heat for the Czechoslovak city of Pilsen. If
Czechoslovak authorities decide to go through with the
project, Siemens could receive the contract to design and
manage construction of the plant. The facility, a
water-cooled nuclear reactor, would supply only heat, not
electricity. It thus would operate at lower temperatures than
full-scale power reactors.
                                                                                                       

   GOOD NEWS FOR EUROPE'S AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   The Association of European Airlines said overall
passenger traffic on its 21 member airlines showed a strong
start to the summer-vacation season, with an 11.5% increase
in May compared with May of 1989. The best results were seen
on Far Eastern and Australian routes where passenger traffic
rose 14% in May, to the highest level in 31 months, the
association said. Good results were also posted by the North
Atlantic routes which were the scene of capacity expansion by
some carriers, the airline group said.
                                                                                                       

   GLOBAL OUTPUT
                                                                                                       

   Global economic output, which grew by 3.1% last year
compared with 4.4% in 1988, is expected to slow further this
year to 2.2%, according to the United Nations World Economic
Survey for 1990.
   The report forecast a recovery to 3% in 1991. But it
warned of a further fall in output in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union as they shift from state planning to market
economies.
   Developed market economies continued their long expansion
in 1989, when their economic output grew by 3.5%, the survey
said. This was lower than the 4.3% figure of the year before
but more vigorous than had been expected. The forecast for
1990 is 2.7%, with a rise to 3.1% projected for 1991.
   The survey suggested the establishment of a Central
European Payments Union, similar to the European Payments
Union set up after World War II, to help the East European
countries move toward market-oriented economies with fully
convertible currencies.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   India, amending a recent government announcement, said
Amnesty International representatives could enter the country
only for private visits and meetings with government
officials but not to investigate alleged human-rights abuses.
Last week, India had said it was completely lifting a ban on
visits by the London-based organization. . . . Authorities in
the French city of Grenoble banned Bermuda shorts in public
pools and encouraged the wearing of bikinis and other skimpy
bathing suits. They said the knee-length shorts, a current
swim-fashion craze, pollute pools. The more swimmers wear,
they said, the dirtier the water.
