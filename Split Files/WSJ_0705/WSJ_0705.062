   MIAMI -- Though man's possible alteration of South
Florida's climate is neither well understood nor widely
discussed here, wetlands drainage is a major public issue for
other environmental reasons.
   Last week, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who is fighting
for re-election, stood on the bank of a central Florida river
and signed legislation authorizing the sale of $3 billion of
state bonds to acquire wetlands. The state, counting on heavy
federal support, is also planning two of the largest land
restoration projects ever undertaken -- official recognition,
environmentalists say, of the shortsightedness of past
water-management policies.

   "Water resources are the critical issue of the next decade
for Florida," says Brian Ballard, Gov. Martinez's chief of
staff. "Everything else you can manage, if you have water."
   In one project, Florida has earmarked $7 million to begin
filling in a 60-mile canal built in the 1950s that shunted
water from Lake Kissimmee, south of Orlando, to Lake
Okeechobee, bypassing the once-meandering Kissimmee River.
The deep trench drained the flood plain adjoining the
Kissimmee and dried out the old river bed. In addition to
draining a marsh once rich in wildlife, the canal polluted
Lake Okeechobee by feeding it high doses of nutrients from
cattle-ranch runoff. Before the canal, water was cleansed by
the leaching process of the slow-flowing and winding river.
   State officials put the cost of restoring the Kissimmee
River at $300 million. "We're looking for the {Army} Corps of
Engineers and the federal government to restore the river,
since they're the ones who came in and built the canal," says
Mr. Ballard.
   The other project is the expansion of Everglades National
Park to encompass key watershed areas to its northeast. Park
officials say the project, to cost an estimated $90 million
in state and federal money, is essential if the park's
ecosystem is to survive.
   The added territory would allow state water regulators to
better simulate the "river of grass" that once washed over
the Everglades and South Florida. Currently, because the land
to the park's northeast is private and thus protected from
flooding by the water district, water pumped into the
Everglades from the north flows over only about half of the
terrain it once drenched. The difference, scientists have
found, has had a jarring effect on the area's wildlife.
   Yet some scientists and environmentalists say Florida's
piecemeal efforts at restoring wetlands are doomed to
failure. Robert Livingston, director of Florida State's
Center for Aquatic Research and Resource Management, is one.
"Most scientists are saying that there isn't enough water any
more," he says. "And if there isn't enough water, how are you
going to restore wetlands?"
