   TOKYO -- NEC Corp. unveiled what it says is the world's
fastest mainframe computer.
   But analysts, and even company officials, said the new
machine would do little to boost the company's tiny share of
the world mainframe market, as the Japanese company still
clings to its own exclusive architecture, for which
relatively little software is available.

   "It's going to be tough for them to make inroads," said
Steven W. Myers, a technology analyst with the Tokyo office
of Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. "I question whether
performance alone is enough."
   Hiroshi Hatta, general manager of product planning for
NEC's information processing unit, added: "We don't have any
positive plans to market this machine overseas." He explained
that "our machine is not compatible with {International
Business Machines Corp.}, and in the U.S. the market for
IBM-compatible machines is very, very large."
   Yesterday's NEC announcement comes a month after Hitachi
Ltd. first showed its new generation mainframe, which it said
at the time was the fastest available. Industry officials
take the Hitachi announcement much more seriously, however,
as its machines are based on IBM's architecture, the
industry's prevailing standard.
   Fujitsu Ltd., which also makes IBM-compatible machines,
and IBM itself, are expected to announce their next
generation machines within the next few quarters. Although
NEC has started taking orders for the machine, it won't begin
shipping units for nine months.
   NEC said its ACOS 3800 machine can compute 100 million
instructions a second (mips) on one processor, and 500 mips
with six processors. Comparisons between companies are
difficult because they use different structures. But Mr.
Hatta said that NEC's machine could run 360 mips with four
processors, compared with 210 mips for Hitachi's
four-processor configuration.
   Mr. Hatta said NEC could accomplish the high-processing
speed because of its advanced semiconductor technology. "The
large-scale integration we're using on this machine is
basically the same technology we're using on our
supercomputers," he added.
   NEC also claims to have the world's fastest supercomputer.
In its most powerful configuration, the new NEC mainframe is
nearly four times as powerful as the current generation. NEC
also claimed to have the world's fastest mainframe when it
last announced a new round of machines in 1985 and 1986.
   But NEC's share of the high-end market is still only
around 2% of the U.S. market, and 8% of the Japanese market,
analysts said. The company said it expects to sell about 200
of the ACOS 3800 machines in the next five years, compared
with about 150 systems of the comparable machines in the past
five years. Hitachi, in contrast, expects to sell 1,000 of
its machines, according to analysts.
