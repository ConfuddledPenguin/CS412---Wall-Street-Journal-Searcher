   New studies found that aging men and advanced cancer
patients can benefit from hormonal treatments.
   Researchers in Wisconsin reported that the increase in fat
tissue and atrophying of the muscles seen in many elderly men
can be reversed by regular injections of human growth
hormone. The hormone is made by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Genentech
Inc.

   Cancer researchers in the Midwest reported that a sex
hormone stimulated the appetite and fostered weight gain in
patients emaciated by cancer. The hormonal drug used in the
study was megestrol acetate, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
under the brand name Megace.
   The experiment with growth hormone in elderly men is
likely to gain wide attention because it suggests that the
frailty of aging can be prevented or even reversed, at least
in some men. But the experiment, published in this week's New
England Journal of Medicine, raises a number of questions,
including whether the treatment, which could cost almost
$14,000 a year, constitutes treatment of a healthy person.
   "Because there are so many unanswered questions about the
use of growth hormone in the elderly and in adults with
growth hormone deficiency, its general use now or in the
immediate future isn't justified," declared a University of
Virginia physician, Mary Lee Vance, in an editorial
accompanying the report from Wisconsin.
   The growth hormone experiment, by a team headed by Daniel
Rudman, professor of medicine at the Medical College of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee, tested a theory that the frailty of
aging is a result, at least in part, of a drop in production
of growth hormone by the pituitary gland.
   "In middle and late adulthood all people experience a
series of progressive alterations in body composition," Dr.
Rudman and his colleagues noted. "The lean body mass shrinks
and the mass of adipose {fat} tissue expands."
   To see if the growth hormone treatments could reverse this
change in body composition, the researchers recruited 21 men
aged 61 to 81 years who, blood tests indicated, had low or
negligible production of growth hormone. Their low output of
growth hormone made them representative of about a third of
men over age 60. Otherwise, the men appeared healthy.
   In the following year, 12 of the men gave themselves shots
of growth hormone three times a week. The remaining nine men
served as controls.
   None of the men experienced any change in weight. But
measurements of body mass by scientists at the Argonne
National Laboratory in Chicago found that the men taking the
growth hormone had an average 8.8% increase in lean tissue
and a 14.4% drop in fat tissue. The density of the spine
vertebrae and the thickness of their skin also increased, as
measured by researchers at the North Chicago Veterans
Administration Medical Center.
   No such changes were seen in the nine men who didn't take
the hormone shots.
   Dr. Rudman and his colleagues, as well as Dr. Vance,
cautioned that larger studies must be done to uncover side
effects of the hormone and to see if reversing the body
composition changes has any benefit. Dr. Vance noted that it
isn't clear if the changes seen in the men in the experiment
"produces substantial improvement in muscle strength,
mobility, or the quality of life." Dr. Vance added, "The cost
of long-term treatment is also an obvious consideration."
   More clear-cut were the potential benefits to cancer
patients of the hormone, megestrol, in a study by the Mayo
Clinic and five cancer centers in Minnesota, the Dakotas,
Nebraska and Pennsylvania.
   Loss of appetite and loss of weight are problems that
afflict an estimated 87% of cancer patients and contribute
directly to death of about 22% of cancer patients, the
researchers noted.
   The researchers gave 67 cancer patients tablets of
megestrol to take three times a day while 66 other cancer
patient volunteers took identical-appearing but inert or
placebo tablets. All the patients had advanced, incurable
cancers, had lost at least five pounds in the preceding two
months and were eating very little.
   Of those who took the hormone tablets, 60% said their
appetite and food intake improved while only about 40% of
those who took the placebo reported such improvements, the
researchers reported in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute.
   Of those who took the hormone for the minimum 10 weeks of
the experiment, 16% had a weight gain of 15 pounds or more
while only 2% of those who took the placebo had such a weight
gain.
