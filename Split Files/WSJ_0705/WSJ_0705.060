   Chrysler Gives Stock Awards to Managers
   In an Effort to Stem High-Level Turnover

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp., in an effort to
stem a surge in management turnover, gave stock awards to the
company's top 1,800 officials if they stay with the auto
maker until January.
   The move is designed to compensate top-level employees
because they didn't get their customary cash bonuses this
year, even though Chrysler had $22 million in its executive
bonus pool. Chrysler's contract with the United Auto Workers
union prevents the company from paying executive bonuses for
years, such as 1989, when rank-and-file workers don't get
profit-sharing payments.

   Omitting bonuses placated the UAW but angered high-level
managers, many of whom get half their total compensation from
the bonus. In the first quarter of 1990, turnover of
"bonus-level" employees hit three times the normal level, a
Chrysler spokesman said.
   "Part of the problem is that they didn't get a bonus," the
spokesman said. "All of a sudden the total compensation
package became noncompetitive, and you had people looking."
   Chrysler wouldn't disclose how much stock it had set aside
for the executives. But the company said all its top
executives, including Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, were awarded
shares. Executives will get the stock in January with no
restrictions on its sale.
   Three top executives -- including Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald -- have either resigned or announced plans to leave
the struggling auto maker in recent months. Pay was a key
factor in only one of those departures: that of Michael N.
Hammes, who resigned as vice president of international
operations to take a top job with Black &amp; Decker Corp.
   But taking a de facto pay cut has caused a surge in
defections among middle- and upper-middle managers who are
eligible for bonuses. Many of these people were angry because
top management had repeatedly promised them some sort of
bonus, albeit reduced from prior years, sources inside the
company said.
   Chrysler's bonus formula assigns a 20% weighting to
profits and another 20% weighting to market share -- two
areas where the company fell well short of its goals.
However, another 20% depends on "customer satisfaction" and
40% depends on vehicle quality. The idea is to induce
managers to focus on more than short-term profits.
   Chrysler met its customer satisfaction and quality goals
last year. But net income dropped 66% to $359 million, or
$1.55 a share, not enough to permit profit-sharing under the
formula agreed on with the UAW.
   The union, which had praised Chrysler's earlier
withholding of cash bonuses, criticized the stock awards as
creating a loophole in the contract. "In this day, when we're
supposed to be a team against competition, that esprit de
corps is only in the board room, it does not extend to the
shop floor," said Aaron Taylor, president of UAW Local 7,
which represents workers idled by the closing of Chrysler's
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday,
Chrysler closed at $15.50, unchanged.
   A year ago, Chrysler announced a $1 billion cost-cutting
program (later raised to $1.5 billion) that included an 8%
reduction in the white-collar ranks by the end of 1989. Along
with that, Chrysler announced a "voluntary" program in which
executives could "bet" on Chrysler's performance by
transferring as much as 10% of their salary to a special
escrow account.
