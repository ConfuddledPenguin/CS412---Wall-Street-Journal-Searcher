   The dollar ended European dealings Wednesday broadly lower
after technical selling was drawn into the market when a key
chart support level against the yen was erased in Asian
dealings.
   In London, the dollar was quoted late at 1.6464 marks,
down from 1.6505 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. unit ended at
149.70 yen, down from 151.10 yen. The pound rose to $1.7840
from $1.7790.

   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 150.68
yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 150.30 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6516 marks, up
from 1.6477 marks on Wednesday.
   The dollar's biggest move Wednesday was against the yen,
although dealers are generally discounting the significance
of Wednesday's action given extremely thin trading
conditions.
   Dealers noted that outside a flurry of morning dealings in
Europe, little business was done in the afternoon. They
pointed to the Independence Day holiday in the U.S., Moslem
observations in the Middle East and lack of interest among
European players in taking overnight positions.
   Laudy Bahl, head of corporate trading at Bank of Tokyo in
London, said that even though technical factors played a
clear role in the dollar's decline on the day, the level of
short-covering seen in late Asian dealings indicates that the
downturn action hasn't quiet signaled a fresh trend.
   She and other dealers expect the dollar to recover
modestly Thursday when Asian markets open given the lack of
clear fundamental trends and some disagreement in the market
over the near-term direction of U.S. and Japanese interest
rates.
   But a dealer with a large U.S. bank added that he agrees
with Ms. Bahl that the dollar may again move to test lower
levels depending on Friday's potentially pivotal U.S.
employment report for June.
   Some technical chart watchers maintained that because of
the dollar's move through long-term chart support levels, the
U.S. currency is more likely to stay under pressure against
the yen Thursday.
   But dealers suggest that the dollar's weakness against the
yen has also taken pressure off movement toward higher
Japanese interest rates, a factor that may translate into
dollar stability once the technical-based selling exhausts
itself.
   In Tokyo, the dollar pitched lower Wednesday as fear of
lower U.S. interest rates set off a wave of selling.
   Japanese players, caught off guard by the dollar's fall
overnight, sold heavily in Pacific and early Tokyo trading.
   While neither U.S. nor Japanese interest rates have moved
substantially, participants are trading on speculation that
the Federal Reserve will ease its tight monetary policy soon.
Thus, Japanese institutions are becoming wary of holding long
dollar positions, dealers said.
   The dollar was pressured lower Tuesday against all major
European currencies amid more activity than most traders
expected ahead of Independence Day. The dollar fell out of
its comfortable range against the mark and through technical
supports vs. the Swiss franc.
   The dollar gained marginally on the yen and Canadian
dollar. Early Asian dealings set the stage for the squaring
of short, or oversold, dollar positions, following the U.S.
unit's rapid decline against these two currencies over the
past week.
   In New York Tuesday, the dollar ended at 1.3930 francs,
below 1.3965 francs late Monday. It was quoted late at 1.6505
marks, unchanged. The U.S. currency was also changing hands
at 150.90 yen, above 150.83 yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Tuesday, gold for
current delivery jumped $3.30 to $362.10 an ounce, the
highest close since May 31.
   In early Hong Kong trading Thursday, gold was quoted at
$361.60 an ounce.
