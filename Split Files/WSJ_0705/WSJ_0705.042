   WASHINGTON -- A government finding blaming the pilot for a
USAir crash at LaGuardia Airport last year is focusing
renewed attention on flight-crew experience and the pairing
of relatively inexperienced pilots.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, in its official
ruling on the cause of the Sept. 20 accident, blamed the
USAir captain for failing, as he taxied for takeoff, to
detect that the rudder trim control was set improperly. That
bad setting caused the plane to veer sharply to the left
during its takeoff roll.

   The panel also criticized the captain for failing to
correct the situation aggressively. The Charlotte, N.C.-bound
plane skidded off the end of the runway and into the Bowery
Bay, breaking into three pieces. Two passengers were killed.
   Both the captain, Michael Martin, and the co-pilot,
Constantine Kleissas, were relatively inexperienced in their
jobs, according to the safety board, raising questions about
whether a more experienced crew would have handled the
situation better. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't
have any rules regulating the pairing of crews, but a joint
industry-government task force, which has been examining the
issue since the USAir crash, is expected to propose such
regulations to the agency shortly.
   The task force may propose that new co-pilots be denied
permission to conduct takeoffs and landings in bad weather.
In the case of the USAir flight, that would have kept Mr.
Kleissas from being at the controls initially. All the
co-pilot's previous Boeing 737 takeoffs had been under the
supervision of special airline instructors, called check
airmen, according to the board.
   While the board didn't blame the co-pilot for the
accident, one member, John Lauber, did question the captain's
judgment in allowing an inexperienced co-pilot to handle a
takeoff during a rainy night at LaGuardia. Another, James
Burnett, proposed that the board officially cite USAir as a
contributor to the accident, arguing that it had failed to
provide a "seasoned and experienced flight crew." But the
other board members rejected that step, saying that the crew
had met the minimum regulatory requirements.
   The task force is being coordinated by the Air Transport
Association, the airlines' trade group. It also may propose
that inexperienced captains and co-pilots be assigned to work
with crew members who are more experienced. FAA Administrator
James Busey said many airlines already have moved to "make
sure that they match a new captain with a well-experienced
co-pilot," but he said that making such a match mandatory
would be a good idea. He said the agency probably would
propose a crew-pairing rule in the late summer or fall.
   The safety board, in its recommendations on the Flight
5050 accident, urged the FAA to take action on the
crew-pairing issue.
   In describing the USAir crash, the board also found that
the captain hadn't set his cockpit equipment so that the
aircraft's automatic brakes would be activated in an aborted
takeoff. USAir recommended the setting, but didn't require it
until after the accident.
   The board said the captain tried to stop the plane by
braking manually, but that he in effect "delayed the
attainment of effective braking" and extended the aircraft's
stopping distance.
   In laying blame for the accident on Mr. Martin, the board
also cited other errors, including trying to use the
nosewheel steering mechanism to straighten out the veering
plane -- an action that investigator Robert Benzon said
"wasn't doing a whit of good" given the aircraft's high speed
at the time.
   What he should have done, Mr. Benzon said, was "punch in a
little bit more right rudder." Investigators also faulted Mr.
Martin for using ambiguous language in the cockpit. For
example, when he decided to abort the takeoff, he said to the
co-pilot, "Let's take it back," but the co-pilot wasn't sure
what he meant.
   At another point, board investigators said, things got so
confused that neither the pilot nor the co-pilot was steering
the plane; each thought the other was doing it. The board
never figured out how the rudder came to be improperly set,
but a cockpit-control knob has since been redesigned to
prevent such problems.
   A spokesman for USAir Group Inc. said: "While we don't
take issue with the NTSB probable-cause statement, it fails
to direct attention to the problem of the rudder trim system
that created the environment in which the accident occurred."
He declined to elaborate.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots' union, called
the board's conclusions, "an absolute travesty."
   Both pilots temporarily lost their licenses, but have
since been retrained and are flying for USAir as first
officers.
