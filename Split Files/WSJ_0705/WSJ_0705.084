   WASHINGTON -- New government figures show the
manufacturing sector continuing on its bumpy path, with
factory orders rising 2.1% in May after declining 2.1% in
April.
   New orders to U.S. factories increased to $240.98 billion
in May, the Commerce Department said, after falling to
$236.03 billion in April and jumping 4%, to $241.07 billion,
in March.

   "These figures are consistent with what we have been
seeing for most of the year," said Neal Soss, chief economist
for First Boston Corp. in New York. "Over the last six
months, orders are up only one-half of a percent . . . What
this says to me is that nothing has changed."
   The department said that much of the strength in May was
concentrated in orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items,
such as cars and aircraft, expected to last at least three
years. Orders for durable goods rose 4% in May to $128.56
billion after declining 4.1% in April and climbing 6.7% in
March. In a preliminary report late last month, the
department had said durable goods rose 3.9% in May.
   Orders in May were strongest for transportation equipment,
which rose 10.1%, with motor vehicles and parts accounting
for most of the gain. Also showing large rises were
nonelectrical machinery, which includes computers, up 3.5%,
and primary metals, up 1.7%.
   "Good thing there is a transportation industry in
America," said Mr. Soss. The manufacturing sector, which he
said is too dependent on transportation equipment, is
currently "at a high level of activity but fairly stagnant"
in growth.
   However, Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago, said the report is "a small positive
because orders are edging upward" but said he questions the
manufacturing sector's ability to maintain its growth.
   "This is a modest uptrend, one that I view as being quite
vulnerable," said Mr. Dederick. "Unless we get some strength
in consumption and capital-goods spending, it will be
vulnerable to aborting its gains."
   Orders for nondurable goods were relatively flat in May,
after a 0.2% gain in April and a 1.1% rise in March. Unfilled
orders -- factory work that is in the pipeline -- edged up
0.4% in May, following a 0.3% increase in April and a 0.7%
rise the month before.
   May shipments, also concentrated in durable goods,
increased 2%, after a 1.3% downturn in April and a 1.2% rise
in March. Inventories of durable goods were unchanged after
April's 0.5% increase, while inventories of nondurable goods
edged up 0.2% in May.
   The numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
