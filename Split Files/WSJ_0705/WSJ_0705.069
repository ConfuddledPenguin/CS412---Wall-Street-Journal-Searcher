   CHICAGO -- John A. Edwardson, a former airline finance
specialist, is joining the union buy-out bid for United
Airlines as its chief financial officer because he sees it as
"the ultimate experiment" in employee corporate ownership.
   Mr. Edwardson, 40 years old, will resign from Imcera Group
Inc., an Illinois-based health and chemical products concern,
tomorrow to join the buy-out team headed by Gerald Greenwald,
former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman.

   The selection of Mr. Edwardson, who spent nearly four
years at NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, is seen as
an effort to strengthen the union group's hand in lining up
the $4.38 billion in financing. He is the first executive
hired by the unions' United Employee Acquisition Corp. with
previous airline experience.
   At NWA, where he was chief financial officer until 1988,
Mr. Edwardson worked extensively with banks in NWA's 1986
merger with Republic Airlines. He also negotiated what at the
time was NWA's first airplane-leasing program, for Boeing
757s, and was instrumental in NWA's purchase of a
half-interest in Trans World Airlines' PARS computer
reservation system.
   Interviewed yesterday, after he completed a four-mile
Fourth of July run in suburban Wilmette where he lives, Mr.
Edwardson said he views the buy-out bid as "an opportunity of
a lifetime. It's a chance for 70,000 people to make business
history together." Long a believer in employee profit-sharing
or employee ownership, he termed the bid for UAL Corp. "the
ultimate experiment of that" concept.
   Although he plans to "immerse myself in the transaction,"
Mr. Edwardson declined to comment on where financing efforts
stand beyond saying, "If I didn't believe this was a bankable
transaction I wouldn't have made this decision."
   In recent days Mr. Greenwald and other union-group
representatives have met with airlines and suppliers in the
U.S. and Europe seeking support. Those investor targets are
believed to have included airplane makers Boeing Co. and
Airbus Industrie, engine manufacturers General Electric Co.
and Rolls-Royce PLC, British Airways PLC and Guinness Peat
Aviation, a leasing concern.
   Mr. Edwardson's decision to join the buy-out effort is
tinged with irony. Several years ago he declined to be
interviewed for the top finance job at UAL because, he said
yesterday, "United and Northwest were competitors and I felt
it would be inappropriate even to consider it."
   As previously reported, UAL Corp.'s current chief
financial officer, John C. Pope, has said he would resign if
the proposed buy-out succeeds.
   After leaving NWA, Mr. Edwardson joined what was then
International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp. as senior vice
president and chief financial and administrative officer. He
subsequently was named executive vice president at the
company, which changed its name to Imcera Group.
   Though Mr. Edwardson termed the timing of his departure
from Imcera "pure coincidence," he wasn't part of an
executive reshuffling at Imcera in recent days that resulted
in the naming of a new president and chief operating officer
-- jobs that some of Mr. Edwardson's colleagues believe he
wanted.
   Imcera didn't name an immediate successor for his
positions.
