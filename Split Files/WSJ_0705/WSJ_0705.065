   PANMUNJOM, South Korea -- Newfound confidence and a
willingness to make concessions could give the South Korean
government another diplomatic breakthrough, this time with
North Korea, its enemy of more than 40 years.
   There still could be a last-minute hitch, but it appears
likely the prime ministers of the two countries will meet in
late August or early September. It would be the highest-level
contact ever by the two hostile governments.

   Seoul made another breakthrough in June when President Roh
Tae Woo met with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in San
Francisco. The Soviet Union is North Korea's main ally and
military supplier.
   The breakthrough came when representatives of both
countries met at the truce village of Panmunjom, where
negotiations have been held off and on since an armistice was
signed there in 1953. The two countries officially are still
at war. South Korea's team, led by Vice Unification Minister
Song Han Ho, softened its hard-line position and agreed to
North Korean demands that had held up negotiations for
months.
   The negotiations were hung up on the agenda for the prime
ministers' meeting; the North wanted political and military
affairs to top the list; the South insisted on cultural and
economic cooperation issues first. On Tuesday the South
agreed not only to the North's agenda, but also to discuss
United Nations membership, another sticking point. "The talks
were settled because we showed concessions," Mr. Song said.
   But the North Koreans also showed signs of change. "We
cannot stick to the logic of the Cold War and ignore changes
in the world," Paik Nam Joon, chief of the North Korean
delegation, told reporters after the meeting. Allies of both
countries have been urging the two governments to ease
tensions on the peninsula.
   The two sides came to an agreement in less than an hour,
breaking up with handshakes and laughter, even from a North
Korean major general who had failed to crack a smile when the
meeting began. "There are no obstacles," said Mr. Paik. "I am
sure they will meet at the end of August or early September."
   The concessions are part of Seoul's new diplomatic game
plan. No longer seeking to isolate Pyongyang, it sees its
advantage in opening up North Korea so that changes sweeping
the communist world may also affect the isolated and
economically backward North. In the past, it often seemed to
observers that the South Korean government lacked the
confidence that it was on the winning side of history. It
feared allowing contact from the North when its radical
students looked to the North for inspiration. "South Korean
leaders . . . are afraid they cannot sustain political
support" if they give in to the North, said Ahn Byung Joon, a
professor of political science at Yonsei University, only a
few months ago. But the South Korean government now suggests
it has more to gain by allowing contact. Mr. Roh declared
Friday that South Korea would accept trade goods directly
from North Korea.
   Neither side now allows direct trade, personal contact,
transmission of each other's television and radio shows or
distribution of each other's newspapers. Even mail between
the countries isn't allowed. It is still a serious crime in
South Korea to visit North Korea without government
permission -- or even to fail to report somebody who is
making an unauthorized visit.
   Past negotiations have bogged down on such trivial issues
as whether North Korea could perform one of its revolutionary
operas in Seoul. In that recent case, the South Korean
government refused, out of fear of offering the North a
propaganda opportunity. It contended it didn't have a
facility large enough to accommodate the North's show, even
though it had hosted the largest Olympic Games in history.
   The agenda for the prime ministers' meeting will be
finalized tomorrow. In both nations, the prime minister isn't
the most powerful political figure. That honor goes to
President Roh in South Korea and President Kim Il Sung in the
North. The prime minister of North Korea is Yon Hyung Mok;
his South Korean counterpart is Kang Young Hoon.
