   A Rogers Communications official said the company already
has a stake of "less than 50%" in Skyline Cablevision, and
that the acquisition of the remaining shares from a group of
individuals in Ottawa would bring its stake to 100%.
   Toronto-based Rogers Communications, through its Rogers
Cablesystems Ltd. unit, has 1.6 million cable subscribers.
Rogers Communications also has interests in
telecommunications, broadcasting and mobile communications.
