   RYE, N.Y. -- Melville Corp. agreed to buy the operating
assets of Circus World Toy Stores Inc., a Greenman Bros. Inc.
subsidiary, for about $95 million.
   The transaction, which is subject to customary conditions
and regulatory approval, is expected to close in August.
Circus World currently operates 330 retail toy stores in 32
states, and its 1989 sales were $177.6 million. It will
become part of Melville's Kay-Bee division.

   Greenman Bros. said proceeds from the sale would be used
for repayment of bank and trade debt and for expansion, as
well as for other corporate purposes.
   Melville, one of the nation's largest specialty retailers
with interests in toys, apparel, prescription drugs and
footwear, had 1989 sales of $7.6 billion. Last year, Kay-Bee
sales totaled $724 million.
   The Circus World acquisition will be financed from
operating cash flow and existing lines of credit.
   Melville Corp. had earnings of $398 million in 1989. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, Melville
shares closed at $53, up 75 cents.
