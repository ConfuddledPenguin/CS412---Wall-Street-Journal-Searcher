   Interleaf Inc. said it expects to report a loss of about
$2.9 million, or 25 cents a share, for the first quarter
ended June 30, compared with a profit of $126,000, or one
cent a share, a year earlier.
   The Cambridge, Mass., maker of electronic publishing
software also said it is unlikely that it will break even for
the first six months of the year, though it expects
"improvement" in the second quarter from the first quarter.
In the year-ago first half, Interleaf had a loss of $843,000,
or seven cents a share, on revenue of $44.4 million.

   Interleaf, which cut its work force 18% last year in a
restructuring, said the first quarter was "difficult,"
because the firm is making the transition to a software and
services company and withdrawing from computer hardware.
