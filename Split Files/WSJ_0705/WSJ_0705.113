   Spain's industry minister, Claudio Aranzadi, reached
agreement with West German government officials for the
planned sale of Spanish truck manufacturer Enasa to MAN AG
and Daimler-Benz AG, the Spanish government television
station said.
   Television de Espana said Enasa, whose full name is
Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., "will be sold" to the
two West German firms. The report didn't give any further
details, and an industry ministry spokesman said he couldn't
elaborate. Mr. Aranzadi is to hold further meetings with MAN
and Daimler-Benz officials today.

   Under the original sale agreement signed in December, MAN
was to take 60% of Enasa and Daimler-Benz 20%. The agreement
valued the Spanish truck manufacturer at 36 billion pesetas
($354.9 million).
   The agreement ran into opposition from the European
Commission and the West German cartel office on the grounds
that it infringed competition rules. The Spanish government
recently offered new proposals under which Enasa's operations
would be split into two divisions, to be run respectively by
MAN and Daimler-Benz.
