   AUSTIN, Texas -- Microelectronic &amp; Computer Technology
Corp., a private research consortium better known as MCC,
said Craig Fields will assume the new posts of president,
chief technical officer and chief operating officer Monday.
   Mr. Fields, 43 years old, was ousted in April as director
of defense research and engineering with the Defense Applied
Research Projects Agency, a research arm of the Defense
Department.

   While with the defense agency, Mr. Fields touted private
industry's involvement in the development of high-definition
television, a technological endeavor in which the U.S. is
competing against Japan and Europe.
   But Mr. Fields rankled the Bush administration and some
Pentagon officials by promoting a federal role in the
development of HDTV, advanced semiconductor manufacturing and
a host of other technologies with potentially big commercial
payoffs. He was demoted to a less-visible Defense Department
post in April.
   MCC, which counts 21 technology companies among its
shareholders, said it would release more information about
Mr. Fields's duties Monday.
