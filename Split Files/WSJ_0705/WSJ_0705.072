   OTTAWA -- The Ontario Supreme Court prohibited four mutual
fund management companies from refusing to deal with discount
brokers and dealers.
   The four companies are: A.G.F. Management Ltd., Mackenzie
Financial Corp., Noram Capital Management Inc. and Templeton
Management Ltd.

   The federal Bureau of Competition Policy investigated the
companies' sales practices after receiving a complaint from a
Toronto discount broker, Gardiner Group Stockbrokers Inc.
Gardiner alleged that the four management companies were
refusing to do business with it because of its practice of
rebating to its clients part of the commission it receives
for the sale of securities of mutual funds.
   The court orders were requested by the Attorney General's
Department with the consent of the four companies.
   The management companies all said they weren't admitting
to any offense. Templeton said it consented to the order to
avoid long and costly litigation. Templeton said it doesn't
refuse to supply any broker because of its low pricing policy
or commission rebate practices.
   The competition bureau said the four companies "have each
taken steps to make clear that securities of mutual funds
managed by them may be sold in Canada on a negotiated basis."
   Since Gardiner Group made its complaint to the competition
bureau in 1985, the company has been acquired by Green Line
Investor Services Inc., a discount stock brokerage unit of
Toronto Dominion Bank. Keith Gray, a Toronto Dominion Bank
senior vice president, said Green Line Investor Services
deals with all four mutual fund management companies named in
the court orders.
