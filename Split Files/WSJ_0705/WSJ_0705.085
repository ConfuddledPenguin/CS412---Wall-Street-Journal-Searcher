   Comdata Holdings Corp., Brentwood, Tenn., said it expects
to take a second-quarter charge of $23 million for prepaying
a non-compete agreement with American Express Information
Services Co.
   Comdata, which provides electronic data services to the
transportation, leisure and retail industries, said the
transaction with the unit of New York-based American Express
Co., including $15 million in cash and a $5.7 million
non-interest-bearing note, will increase the loss that the
company expects to report for the second quarter, but will
"reduce substantially" its continuing amortization costs in
the future. Comdata had a net loss of $1.8 million on revenue
of $32.7 million a year earlier.

   Comdata said the non-compete obligation relates to the
company's acquisition in June 1989 of three American Express
Information Services units.
