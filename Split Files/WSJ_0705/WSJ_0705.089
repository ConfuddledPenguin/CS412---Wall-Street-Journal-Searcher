   CHICAGO -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on
about $1.14 billion of debt issued by the investment and
manufacturing empire controlled by beleaguered William
Farley.
   Separately, Mr. Farley's troubled, closely held holding
company, Farley Inc., disclosed in its annual report that its
1989 net loss widened to $814.7 million from $41.8 million in
1988.

   A recently obtained auditor's report to Farley Inc.
directors by the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young cites the
company's previously reported failure to make interest
payments on certain debt. "These conditions raise substantial
doubt about Farley Inc.'s ability to continue as a going
concern," the report said.
   Farley Inc.'s latest annual report states current assets
of $1.57 billion and current liabilities of $3.25 billion.
   S&amp;P lowered Farley Inc.'s subordinated debt rating to
single-C from triple-C, and lowered ratings on the senior
debt of Farley's 95%-owned West Point-Pepperell Inc. unit to
triple-C-minus from single-B-minus. The ratings concern said
Farley Inc., based in Chicago, "remains in a strained
financial condition due to its heavy debt load, and the
general weakness of some of Farley's operating units."
   Mr. Farley hasn't been able to complete last year's
protracted $1.56 billion tender offer for West
Point-Pepperell, a textile company based in West Point, Ga.
   A Farley spokeswoman had no immediate comment.
   Mr. Farley's financial strength was based on junk bonds.
That strength is ebbing in the wake of the collapse of his
investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Farley continues to negotiate with his
bondholders and bankers over voting control and majority
ownership of West Point-Pepperell, according to sources close
to the situation. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., financial adviser to
some of Mr. Farley's bondholders, suggested to its clients in
May that they seek voting control, according to a person
close to those discussions.
   Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley and his creditors in
March when West Point Acquisition Corp., the unit he set up
to buy West Point-Pepperell, fell into default on $796
million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest payments.
