   Leaders of Eastern Airlines's machinists union are
scheduled to meet with officials of Northwest Airlines later
this week to discuss a possible integration of the carriers,
according to people familiar with the talks.
   It's unclear whether NWA Inc.'s Northwest unit would be
interested in buying all of Eastern, currently operating
under bankruptcy-court protection, or just some assets.
Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., declined to comment on
such a purchase, although it's understood it might want to
buy some of Eastern's gates in Atlanta as well as the
carrier's maintenance facility there. Eastern is a unit of
Continental Air Holdings Inc.

   People familiar with the machinists union, however, say
that Northwest would absorb Eastern's entire system. Those
people say leaders of the machinists union will meet with
Alfred Checchi, Northwest's chairman, this week.
   An Eastern spokesman declined to comment on any talks.
However, in a company newsletter sent to employees last
month, Eastern said that Northwest and Pan Am Corp., New
York, had approached it to discuss "the possibility of future
business relationships." Eastern wouldn't rule out "either
the possibility of a merger with another carrier or a
buy-out," the newsletter said.
