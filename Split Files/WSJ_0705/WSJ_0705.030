   A study by the National League of Cities offers more
evidence of the additional tax load any federal tax increase
would place on voters: About 41% of surveyed cities in their
current budgets have already raised property taxes and 76%
have raised various fees. But only half have cut their rate
of spending growth. In other words, most taxpayers already
know from experiences in their own neighborhoods that, like
Washington, the politicians' reflexive answer to their
failure to gain control of spending is a tax increase to
"cut" the "deficit."
