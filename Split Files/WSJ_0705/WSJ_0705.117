   Talman Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Chicago
said a private investor group terminated a previously
disclosed preliminary purchase offer of $10 a share, or $100
million.
   The investor group is led by Harrison I. Steans, who has
headed a number of Chicago-area bank holding companies in
recent years.

   Talman said Mr. Steans dropped the bid after he had a
chance to look at the company's books. The thrift said the
figures caused Mr. Steans to revise downward his original
earnings projections.
   Talman also said it anticipates that second-quarter
earnings will be lower than those in the first quarter,
primarily because of increased costs of funds. It said
earnings will also be hurt by expenses related to the
transaction that was terminated.
   In the first quarter of 1990, Talman Home had net income
of $4.5 million, or 47 cents a share.
   Talman's stock closed Tuesday in national over-the-counter
trading at $4.75 a share, down $2.875.
