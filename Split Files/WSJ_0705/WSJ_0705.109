   Sweden's Procordia AB continued its push into European
confectionery by acquiring Danish candy maker Benzon Brands
AS.
   Benzon Brands, a unit of Danish holding concern Monberg &amp;
Thorsen Holdings, is the third European candy company snapped
up by Procordia in the past 18 months. The acquisition brings
Procordia a new brand of product, Sorbits chewing gum, plus
bases in Holland and Belgium.

   Terms weren't disclosed. Procordia officials said the
purchase price was less than Benzon Brands' 1989 sales of 450
million Danish kroner ($71.2 million) but declined to
elaborate, citing a pledge of confidentiality given to the
Danish seller.
   The relatively modest price fetched by Benzon Brands' core
candy operations reflect dwindling profit in recent years.
According to Procordia officials, Benzon Brands' pretax
profit fell 52% last year to 24 million kroner from 50
million kroner the previous year.
   Besides confectionery, Benzon Brands also makes skin-care
and hair-care products, which account for about a fifth of
sales. Those activities will be shifted to a division at
Procordia's drug unit.
