   PARIS -- A new world leader is being forged in a cauldron
of political and economic change: a Europe bigger, more
united and more powerful than seemed possible six months ago.
   Unexpectedly strong growth in West Germany and France,
fired by extraordinarily large investment by corporations, is
helping politicians mold once sacrosanct national policies
into pan-European consensus. Seemingly unachievable goals
such as the unification of Germany and the rebuilding of
Eastern Europe are being achieved, fueling a strong sense of
optimism.

   "Before the end of the century there will be a single
currency in Europe," Cornelis van der Klugt, former chairman
of N.V. Philips of Holland, recently told a lecture hall
jammed with business students in St. Gallen, Switzerland.
"Much of Eastern Europe will be in the EC," he continued,
"and 20 years from now there will be a Europe of 700 million
people able to be equal partners with the U.S., Japan and the
rest of the world."
   Evidence of much greater political confidence abounds,
too. The formerly fractious European Community reacted
immediately and unanimously to the recent repression of
dissent in Romania by cutting off all but humanitarian aid.
So successful has been the EC-led effort to coordinate help
to Poland and Hungary that the EC may be asked by other
industrialized nations to lead a similar aid program to the
Soviet Union, and maybe also Latin America and the Caribbean.
   European politicians are crowing. "Europe is no longer in
search of its identity," says French Prime Minister Michel
Rocard. "It is now the fulcrum of international relations."
Says EC Commission vice president Henning Christophersen:
"Europe is now the pole of attraction for the whole world."
Adds Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: "There
is a dynamism for development in Europe with less {perceived}
risk than in the United States."
   Fears that the collapse of physical barriers to Eastern
Europe would derail Western Europe's effort to remove its
internal trade barriers have proved groundless. Western
European integration is both accelerating and spreading.
Fears that a united Germany would dominate Europe militarily
and economically are giving way to confidence that Germany
will be the engine driving a fast-growing Europe.
   Worries about global recession are absent here. Unlike
Japan, Europe has a big and growing home market. Unlike the
U.S., it has neither a budget deficit nor a savings-and-loan
crisis.
   Business is betting on a decade of European prosperity.
Volkswagen, which already owns the Spanish auto maker SEAT,
has announced plans to build 250,000 cars a year in East
Germany. Coca-Cola, which recently built a new bottling plant
in Dunkirk, France, also plans to invest $140 million in East
Germany. PepsiCo will spend more than $1 billion on a trade
deal with the Soviet Union.
   General Electric of the U.S. bought just over half of
Hungarian lightbulb maker Tungsram for $150 million, at the
same time as it is developing several West European joint
ventures to make turbines and household appliances. Sony is
planning a fourth stereo equipment factory in France. Philip
Morris just plunged into the cutthroat European food business
by agreeing to buy 80% of Swiss coffee and chocolate producer
Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion.
   Mergers involving Europe's 1,000 biggest companies have
nearly quadrupled in the past five years. Last year, there
were more than 400. European investment in the U.S. reached
more than $250 billion in assets at the end of last year; it
is greater in dollar volume yet less politically sensitive
than Japanese investment.
   French groups have been particularly hungry. Recently,
Rhone-Poulenc bought Rorer Group, a pharmaceuticals maker.
Groupe Michelin bought Uniroyal Goodrich to become the
world's biggest tire maker. Pechiney bought American National
Can Co. to become the world's biggest can maker, and Hachette
bought two publishing concerns, Grolier and Diamandis
Communications, in separate transactions totaling more than
$1 billion.
   But Europe's renaissance will cause problems, too --
especially for the U.S. Hans-Joerg Rudloff, chairman of
Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., says that current tight
credit conditions will tighten further for Latin America and
the U.S. "Capital will go to the countries that show the
highest growth potential for the next five to 10 years;
that's Eastern Europe, not South America," he says. "The
market will force the U.S. to earn the money it imports. The
market won't any longer finance U.S. fiscal and monetary
indiscipline."
   Fast economic and political integration of the EC's 12
countries could also unbalance the organization. West Germany
represents about 30% of the EC's gross national product; the
united Germany would represent about 35%. In contrast, France
has about 20%, and Italy and the United Kingdom each have
about 12%. Yet these four countries have the same voting
power within EC institutions; they also have the same number
of members of the European Parliament, and the same number of
EC Commissioners.
   "Will the system still work as well?" wonders former
French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing. "It's not a
military fear of invasion, but we do need to handle this
shift in power within the EC." To avoid internal friction,
says Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the Germans mustn't push for more
EC voting power right away.
   A more general worry is that outside events, such as a
violent break-up of the Soviet Union or clashes between
nationalist groups in Eastern Europe, could quickly deflate
corporate and political confidence in Europe. But short of a
cataclysm, it seems assured that intra-European trade will
become easier and the production of goods and services
cheaper. This would make European companies more competitive
world-wide, and also make it more profitable for U.S. and
Japanese companies to do business here.
   Germany is the first target for investment. "We have to
strengthen the position of all our companies in Germany,"
says Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti and of
COFIDE, an industrial holding company. Olivetti already owns
Triumph-Adler, a West German office machines company, and
COFIDE's Valeo unit recently bought two German auto parts
makers. "Germany is the place where things will happen," Mr.
De Benedetti says. "Germany will be the center of industrial
power in Europe."
   A Germany growing at 4% a year or more -- an estimate many
economists think is conservative -- will pull the rest of
Europe up along with it, and increase Europe's global reach.
"To have a European strategy is to have a global strategy,"
says Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman of Matra SA, the defense
contractor. Matra has deepening links with Germany through
one current and two planned joint ventures with Daimler-Benz,
the aerospace and automotive conglomerate, which owns a small
amount of Matra's shares.
   Joergen Rasmussen, whose family owns Rasmussen GmbH, a
maker of industrial hose clamps in Maintal, near Frankfurt,
runs his plant round the clock and still can't keep up with
demand. "Germany is absolutely booming," he says, showing a
visitor around the spotless, computer-controlled shipping
room, where robot arms move soundlessly up, down and across a
grid of shelves, pluck out shiny clamps and put them on a
conveyor belt. They are ready to be shipped, all without
human intervention. This system has allowed the company to
double sales in the past three years, he says. Rasmussen,
like hundreds of other West German companies, has signed a
letter of intent to buy an East German company. Rasmussen
hopes the acquisition of a parts maker will increase sales in
the East and add more production capacity cheaply.
   But investments tend to be different in Eastern Europe,
the continent's Appalachia. Dresdner Bank, along with other
big German banks, is rapidly opening dozens of branches in
East Germany to help soak up the mark windfall generated by
monetary union. Its effort required ingenuity as well as
capital: Dresdner rented a satellite telephone channel and
gave each of its new branches a receiving dish and new
telephones, thus establishing reliable communications without
having to wait for East Germany's antiquated phone system to
be rebuilt.
   Still, with the political and business climate unsettled
in Eastern Europe, most of the action remains in the West.
Big European companies are getting bigger by buying American,
by buying each other, and spreading their wings.
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, for example, last year bought
Pillsbury of the U.S. and is now embarking on the conquest of
the continental sweet tooth. Ove Sorensen, president of the
Haagen-Dazs unit Grand Met acquired in the deal, sits in a
corner of Paris's first Haagen-Dazs shop, not far from the
Arc de Triomphe. Around him Parisians sample the delights of
vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds, or pralines
and caramel at a pricey nine francs a scoop. Business is
brisk, but Mr. Sorensen's eyes are on Europe's grocery trade.
He already has gotten his ice cream into 100 Paris groceries
and frozen-food outlets, and into Harrod's department store
in London.
   Pillsbury had put 13 Haagen-Dazs stores in West Germany
three years ago, but Grand Met's appetite is much bigger. A
new shop opened last week in London's Leicester Square, and
more are planned soon in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria,
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.
   The political background to this economic optimism is an
unexpected detente between two factions within the EC, the
"deepeners" and the "broadeners." This seemingly arcane
political debate has real economic consequences. For the
"deepeners," led by France, Europe's future depends on ever
tighter links between the 12 current EC members, including a
single European currency and a European government. This,
they argue, would tie Germany permanently into the Western
European economic system. For the "broadeners," led by Great
Britain, Europe's future depends on bringing Scandinavia,
Switzerland and Eastern Europe into a loose federation of
sovereign states, where national parliaments remain supreme.
   Suddenly it seems both sides are right. "Widening and
deepening will occur simultaneously," says UK deputy prime
minister Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   This is happening because of a fortuitous combination of
economic good times and political guile. The Berlin Wall
collapsed during a boom in Western Europe, and well after the
program to dismantle trade barriers by 1992 was under way.
Rebuilding Eastern Europe is apt to mean slightly higher
inflation in Germany, but an annual growth rate at or above
4%. European politicians -- whatever their personal
reservations -- have welcomed the unification of Germany in
order to embed it in a more-unified EC.
   The psychological success of the EC's 1992 plan has led
the deepeners to plunge ahead with plans to create a European
central bank system and a single European currency. While
final decisions won't be made before a treaty-writing
conference in December, already the EC Commission has a
detailed blueprint for a linked central bank system, to be
called EuroFed. Even the British, long holdouts against
economic and monetary union, have proposed a plan for a
common, though not obligatory, European currency.
   The deepeners are now pushing political union as a way to
cope with the startling change in Eastern Europe. This could
eventually lead to a much more genuine political federation
that would allow pan-European control over things such as
defense and security that now are solely national concerns.
These changes won't be made final until a separate
treaty-writing conference meets alongside the economic one.
But ideas include establishing a powerful European Senate of
government officials from each member, to approve Europe-wide
legislation; strengthening the role of the existing elected
European Parliament; giving the EC's executive Commission
more of a political role; or all of these at once.
   The broadeners are getting their way, too. Many other
European countries, scared they will be denied full access to
the EC, now want in. The current EC -- Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark,
Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal -- won't accept new
members till the 1992 program is fully operating. But it is
negotiating a liberal free-trade treaty with members of the
European Free Trade Association (Sweden, Norway, Finland,
Iceland, Austria and Switzerland) to create a "European
Economic Space" encompassing 18 countries with 360 million
people.
   The EC is also negotiating trade agreements with Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Both the EFTA and
Eastern European agreements could eventually lead to full EC
membership for these countries. Turkey, Malta and Cyprus also
want in, and Austria has applied to join separately from
EFTA.
   EC officials, who had crossed their fingers hopefully when
predicting that the 1992 plan would raise growth by 5%, have
uncrossed them and revised their forecasts to at least 7%.
Even before the developments in Eastern Europe, capital
investment in the EC soared by 9% in 1988, more than double
what was forecast, and investment has stayed robust since
then.
   German economist Herbert Giersch, who was among the first
to describe the "Eurosclerosis" of the late 1970s, is now on
the high-growth bandwagon. "This is not a sham prosperity,"
he says. "It is based on modest wage growth and higher
investment going into productive capacity. The long-term
upswing should last well into the next millennium."
