   WEST BERLIN -- The ink isn't even dry on the epic
agreement that merged the two German economies, but Bonn and
East Berlin are already speeding on to the next step.
   The East German government agreed to Bonn's agenda for
political unification by proposing Dec. 2 for the first free
elections in a united Germany since 1932, preparing the way
for this summer's talks to formally end German division. The
proposal was seen in Bonn as a sign that East Berlin's
leadership has overcome internal opposition to a swift
unification process. Bonn had proposed Dec. 2 or Dec. 9 as
dates for the all-German vote.

   This isn't to say the process will be easy or smooth.
Yesterday West Germany's coalition government failed to agree
on a fundamental question: Should the unified elections be
held before, or after, formal German unification?
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and
its Free Democratic Party allies did endorse East Berlin's
Dec. 2 proposal for the first free all-German vote since
1932. But the Christian Democrats want the two Germanys to
hold separate elections on that day, with political
unification formally taking place at midnight the same day.
The Free Democrats are insisting that unification come first,
followed by a single election in which all Germans would
participate.
   The Free Democrats contend that separate elections would
help the Christian Democrats' political allies in East
Germany, who are more likely to gain the 5% minimum vote in
the polls required for parliamentary representation if they
only have to compete in East Germany. If unified national
elections were held, the small East German parties would have
less chance of meeting the 5% minimum.
   Meanwhile, a joint commission tomorrow begins negotiating
a second state treaty between the two Germanys. The pact,
which would allow the merger of East German states under an
article in West Germany's Basic Law, would complete a
unification process that began when the two nations on Sunday
unified their monetary, economic and social systems. The
costly rescue operation for the crippled East German economy
was set down by a treaty ratified by the two German
parliaments last month.
   West German officials have been pressing East Germany to
agree to a quick political follow-up to monetary and economic
union to better coordinate East Germany's difficult economic
adjustment. In a recent interview, Bonn Economics Minister
Helmut Haussmann said that "from an economic standpoint, a
free market can only be brought about under a united
government and one federal budget."
   West German parties and their East German counterparts are
already preparing to merge by autumn. East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere has been promised the post of
deputy chairman of West Germany's ruling Christian Democrats.
   East Berlin also disclosed plans to reorganize its
regional districts into five federal states and to hold state
elections on Oct. 14, about three weeks later than originally
planned. The division of East Germany into five federal
states would then allow each state to be absorbed into the
West German federal republic as provided for under the Basic
Law, West Germany's constitution.
   East Germany stipulated, however, that achieving an
all-German ballot depends on the success of the Two-Plus-Four
negotiations on the status of a united Germany. The talks
include the two Germanys and the four World War II allies --
the U.S., the Soviet Union, Britain and France. West German
Chancellor Kohl, who has sanctioned West German credits and
aid programs for the ailing Soviet economy, recently
expressed confidence that the talks would reach an accord in
time for the special session in November of the Conference
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
