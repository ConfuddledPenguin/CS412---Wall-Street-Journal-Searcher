   LONDON -- Seeking new business last spring, Maggie Taylor
assured a potential advertising client that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Co.'s troubles didn't touch its similarly named flagship ad
agency.
   Ms. Taylor, a planning director for the London agency,
recalls the would-be client grilled her hard: "Will you still
be our team in six months' time? Are you going to get fed up
and leave?" Unconvinced, the British manufacturer took its
business elsewhere.

   A few weeks later, Ms. Taylor and six colleagues quit to
form their own shop. It was the biggest defection ever from
Britain's largest and most award-winning agency.
   The breakaway pummeled the parent's share price, because
investors feared possible client losses and a wider exodus
from an agency created by company founders Maurice and
Charles Saatchi in 1970. Saatchi pooh-poohed the defectors as
disgruntled unknowns, then sued them to dissuade others and
recover everything from corporate marker pens to old news
clippings.
   A major walkout from the heart of the empire marked a
symbolic turning point for Saatchi, the world's biggest
advertising business until a flawed diversification led to
red ink and a boardroom upheaval in recent months. The
Charlotte Street agency, informally known by its address, no
longer can escape the parent's well-known ills.
   "In this town, the name Saatchi is now associated with
failure. Advertising is basically about selling confidence,"
says Tim Delaney, creative director at Leagas Delaney, a
smaller rival. The Charlotte Street attitude of "`we can do
no wrong, we are the world conquerors' is gone."
   The Saatchi agency is snaring fewer clients. It has
tumbled to seventh place in the U.K. ad-agency new-business
rankings so far in 1990, after leading the pack for the past
three years. Amid Britain's worst ad downturn in a decade,
Charlotte Street lost several medium-sized clients earlier
this year, while many remaining ones (mostly hard-hit
retailers) are slashing their ad budgets.
   And staff morale has begun to sag under a round of
layoffs, deferred pay raises and other cost-cutting measures
dictated by the harsher business climate and the parent's
burdensome debt.
   Saatchi executives insist Charlotte Street's powerful
creative reputation remains unscathed and predict solid
profits this year for its overall U.K. advertising and
marketing-services operation, which barely broke even in the
first fiscal half.
   "I hope we will be on top" in new-business rankings by
year end, says agency Managing Director Paul Bainsfair. With
typical Saatchi bravado, he corrects himself: "I am sure we
will be No. 1." Even if "Charlotte Street doesn't win the
Super Bowl," Mr. Bainsfair goes on, "it doesn't mean the end
of the dynasty."
   But the jewel in Saatchi's crown may be all that's left
after dismemberment of the far-flung enterprise. Some
industry analysts think that to repay debt, the company will
shed everything but the international ad network headed by
the flagship agency -- and then go private by letting the
disillusioned Saatchi brothers buy it back. That "is a
perfectly reasonable scenario," says an individual close to
Saatchi. "They would like to go back to running an agency
again . . . like they used to do." Saatchi officials haven't
ruled out the possibility of a future disposal of one of the
two international ad networks.
   Charlotte Street grew out of an agency the youthful Iraqi
Jewish brothers launched with #25,000 of borrowed capital,
tough creative standards, systematic client poaching -- and a
knack for well-timed publicity. "The clients for whom the
Saatchis have done the best job for are Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,"
remarks Chris Jones, J. Walter Thompson's managing director
in Britain and an ex-Saatchi man.
   The agency bred fierce, almost familial loyalty, based on
"Saatchism" -- a culture of success and the cocky belief that
nothing is impossible. Maurice Saatchi once tried (but
failed) to land Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s Continental Europe
account by offering to move Saatchi's Paris operation to
Lyons in order to serve the U.S. power tool maker's European
office there.
   The brothers ran their rapidly expanding business for more
than a decade from Charlotte Street's sixth, top floor.
There, temperamental Charles often tossed phones and chairs
at Maurice during shouting matches audible below. (Both
declined to be interviewed for this article.) Corporate
headquarters moved several blocks away in 1986, after a
dizzying string of U.S. acquisitions had realized the pair's
global ambitions.
   But close ties linger between the agency and the brothers.
Reclusive and eccentric Charles Saatchi, despite his
preoccupation with a bulky contemporary art collection, still
routinely calls to suggest music for commercials or critique
campaigns. Charlotte Street initially kept its favored-child
status even when the parent company's earnings tumbled last
year and Chairman Maurice Saatchi relinquished the
chief-executive-officer role. Although Saatchi reduced its
world-wide staff by some 800 during 1989, the agency escaped
layoffs at that time.
   Maurice Saatchi, urged by Saatchi's new Chief Executive
Robert Louis-Dreyfus, resumed wooing potential and current
Charlotte Street clients this spring -- something he rarely
did during the company's takeover spree.
   In any case, his efforts may not suffice. The downturn in
Charlotte Street's new business partly mirrors advertisers'
skittishness about turmoil at the parent company. "This
feeling that Saatchi might be a slightly precarious bet has
to come through to the new-business clients," a senior agency
official concedes.
   Peter Church, advertising manager at Abbey National Bank
PLC, concurs. "Heavy media coverage of Saatchi's {corporate}
situation at the moment" may persuade some advertisers "to
not commit themselves to a new agency." The U.K. bank
recently stopped using Charlotte Street for its #2.5 million
($4.4 million) checking-account campaign after employing the
agency for four years. "We felt we hadn't gotten the right
creative idea," Mr. Church says, adding: "It may well be that
they have hit the crest of the wave."
   A new corporate name might end client confusion between
the still-successful agency and its ailing parent, many
Charlotte Street staffers believe. They have even dreamed up
some alternatives: Chas. &amp; Mo Inc. or Titanic Enterprises
Inc. The Saatchi brothers aren't amused. "They're used to it
{the name} and don't want to change it" because they "spent
20 years building up a company" called Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
explains the individual with Saatchi ties.
   At the same time, the corporate and industry crunch now is
forcing retrenchment at the flagship agency. Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus has been nicknamed "Jaws" for effectively
freezing most equipment purchases companywide. "You've got
fewer tools to do your business with," complains a manager
who recently quit Charlotte Street, primarily because of such
spending restrictions.
   The Saatchi agency laid off 30 of its roughly 900 staffers
in February -- the first ever. More layoffs loom, workers
fear. Further job cuts aren't expected "at the moment," says
Mr. Bainsfair, the managing director. But "the great $64,000
question is how long will this {downturn} go on for?" The
agency may skip this year's Christmas bonus, typically a
month's pay, And its management is cracking down on certain
common ad-industry practices, offering fewer company cars and
banning expense-account staff lunches.
   Around the corner from the agency's squat gray building, a
French brasserie feels the pinch. A year ago, "we used to
have dozens and dozens of Saatchi people in here from early
afternoon until early evening drinking champagne," recalls
Zazou manager Nick Stern. The Saatchi people "now are all
eating sandwiches at their desks," he sighs.
   The Saatchi setbacks have failed to completely diminish
the flagship agency's characteristic self-assurance, however.
It recently ran a secretarial recruiting ad that promised
applicants they would "be working at the most successful
advertising agency in the known universe."
   "There is still a hell of an atmosphere" here, argues the
senior agency official. Even with fewer people, "the people
here are very Saatchi. We still do great advertising."

   NEW ACCOUNT: Goldberg Moser O'Neill will handle the
national launch of Wings, a personal learning system by
Intelligy Corp. The win, estimated at more than $5 million,
is the first for the former Chiat/Day/Mojo San Francisco
office since its management buy-out.
                                                                                                       

   ALLY COMPENSATION PLAN: Ally &amp; Gargano, hoping to attract
the attention of potential car clients, introduced a gimmicky
new compensation for car makers. The new system would involve
paying Ally primarily in cash but partly in cars. It also
would involve a sliding commission based on sales goals; if
sales fell short of goals, Ally would be paid less cash and
more cars. Bill Luceno, chief executive, said the plan aims
to "provide a little incentive for somebody to come on in and
talk to us." And what happens to the cars? "We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it."
                                                                                                       

   ADS MODIFIED: PepsiCo and Nestle's Stouffer Foods unit
modified campaigns in response to inquiries by the National
Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business
Bureaus. The campaigns, for Diet Pepsi and Stouffer's frozen
pizza, used comparison claims the NAD said were
unsubstantiated.
