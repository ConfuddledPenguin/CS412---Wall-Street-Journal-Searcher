   Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., said it plans to

   Designed for indoor and outdoor use, each camera will be
sold loaded with a 24-exposure roll of Kodacolor Gold 400
print film, Kodak said. Upon completing all 24 exposures, a
user may return the entire camera to a photofinisher, who
will process the film and return the camera for recycling.
