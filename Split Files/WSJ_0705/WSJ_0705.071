   WASHINGTON -- Kyodo News Service correspondent Hirotsugu
Aida probably would write more about what happens at the
White House if he had a desk. But despite his 40 million
readers back in Japan, he doesn't have any place to sit. The
White House won't give him one.
   Wearing a broad grin -- and comfortable shoes -- in the
West Wing press office where he spends most of the day, Mr.
Aida borrows a vacant chair assigned to Scripps-Howard
Newspapers and laughs: "I don't like it."

   Japanese reporters are flooding the U.S. capital these
days. But Washington, in its inscrutable way, has kept the
welcome mat tightly rolled. In small but telling ways, a city
that prides itself as cosmopolitan treats Japanese
journalists as second-class citizens. Japan currently buys
about a third of U.S. government debt, for example, but no
Japanese news agencies have been allowed work space in the
Treasury's newsroom.
   Japan appears to have the largest colony of foreign
correspondents based in the U.S., with 79 working here and
another 129 in New York. That makes Japan's press corps in
those cities far larger than West Germany's (52 in Washington
and 74 in New York), France's (25 and 49) and Britain's (37
and 52).
   That's a major shift in the balance of media power from 15
years ago, when Britain and West Germany maintained the
biggest communications links here and in New York, and Japan
had only half the number of reporters in Washington that it
has now.
   Press observers say Japanese reporters also are better
educated and better at their jobs than they were years ago.
In the past they often were content simply to translate
stories from U.S. newspapers, a practice not uncommon among
foreign correspondents. Now they do more first-hand
reporting. They have acquired a reputation for provoking
controversial statements from officials through persistent
questioning, and often scoop U.S. news organizations on
Washington stories, particularly those dealing with trade
issues.
   "They work late at night and they are always aggressive,"
says Frank Baba, a retired director of the Foreign Press
Center, a division of the U.S. Information Agency that
facilitates briefings and interviews for the foreign press. A
longtime observer of the Japanese press, Mr. Baba maintains
his contacts through long afternoons on the golf course. Not
only have their numbers grown, he says, but so too has the
competition among them -- and the money they make and spend
pursuing their stories.
   But, as Kyodo's Mr. Aida has learned, all that doesn't
mean they're treated with respect. Mr. Aida, who believes he
is the first Japanese wire-service reporter to be assigned
full time to the White House, has asked for a desk and chair
in the cramped briefing room in the West Wing. He wants
nothing more than what his French, British, and, of course,
U.S. colleagues already have. So far, no luck. Direct and
indirect requests have been pending since late last year, but
a press office aide says "He's way down on the list" of
applicants to be granted space. The aide says dozens of other
news organizations are seeking working space at the White
House, including numerous U.S. media groups that take
precedence.
   Mr. Aida isn't alone. No Japanese news agencies have
chairs or desk space in the cramped newsroom at the Treasury.
Despite several requests dating back to January, and despite
the fact that Japanese investors and institutions acquire an
estimated 30% or more of U.S. government notes and bonds,
they haven't been granted space at the Treasury, the single
most vital source of financial news in this country.
   Both Kyodo and Jiji Press, Japan's two biggest news
agencies, have applied for a vacant spot made available by
the demise of McGraw-Hill Inc.'s business news wire. U.S.
news services also have applied, but no decision has been
made, says Treasury spokeswoman Desiree Tucker.
   "I was always a little bit surprised by the xenophobia
among some of our colleagues," says Johanna Neuman, former
president of the White House Correspondents' Association.
During her tenure she fielded numerous protests from U.S.
reporters who objected to sitting next to the Japanese press
corps during summits, complaining that they smoke too much.
   At the Houston Economic Summit next week, the Japanese
press corps isn't likely to be disadvantaged much, if only
because the Japanese government is handling most
accommodations for them. But they will be seated far away
from the regular White House press corps, which has its own
room.
   There is another side to this, however. While Japanese
reporters in Washington are denied seats at the Treasury and
the White House, U.S. reporters in Tokyo sometimes aren't
even given standing room. When Japanese government agencies
and companies have news to announce they frequently announce
it only to the Japanese "press club" that covers them. In
recent years, some press clubs have begun to allow foreign
journalists to attend their briefings, but others are still
closed. When Sony Corp. announced last year that it was
acquiring Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4
billion, it did so at a news conference that foreign
reporters were told they couldn't attend.
   But Japanese reporters in the U.S. also complain about
what they see as an inability or unwillingness of many U.S.
officials to provide the level of detailed information
Japanese reporters need to satisfy finicky readers back home.
One reason for this seems to be that contact with
high-ranking government officials is more difficult here than
in Japan, where reporters are frequently invited to visit
officials at their residences late at night. "Here in
Washington, politicians don't want to be visited at home in
their private time," notes Sadafumi Tani of Jiji Press.
   While he says he tries to remain objective as a
journalist, Mr. Tani says "I sometimes feel uneasy and
offended" by occasionally unfounded criticism of his nation
he hears on Capitol Hill. Some criticism of Japan is
justified, he adds. "I accept the blaming if it is based on
the facts and is reasonable. But in many cases, the blaming
is just for the sake of blaming."
   On the other hand, he credits such top officials as U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter with a "profound" understanding of trade
problems that sometimes exceeds those of their Japanese
counterparts.
