   TOKYO -- The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
released its vision for the 1990s, with a general theme of
"creating human values in the global age."
   The document, as expected, professes a shift from visions
for the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, which focused on Japan's
economic growth and international competitiveness. Skeptics,
however, question whether the agency, which many credit with
helping coordinate Japan's rapid industrial rise, has really
changed its basic policies.

   The statement says the ministry's three main objectives
for the 1990s are to "contribute to international society and
promote internal reforms;" to "improve the quality of life
for the Japanese people;" and to "secure the foundations of
long-term economic growth."
   To support those goals, the ministry calls for major
changes in Japan's domestic economy, such as shortening
working hours, cutting land prices and encouraging imports.
   It also calls for Japan to play a more active
international role, particularly in environmental and Third
World development issues. It says Japan should become "a new,
powerful, and creative standard bearer" for the world.
   To help sustain Japan's domestic economy, the vision
statement calls for improving Japan's "information
infrastructure" by promoting the more widespread use of
technology.
