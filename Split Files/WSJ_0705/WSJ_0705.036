   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Investments sold its controlling
interest in Dual Drilling Co. to Mosvold Shipping A/S of
Kristiansand, Norway, for $170 million. Dual, of Dallas, is
among the nation's largest offshore oil drilling concerns.
   "Essentially, it was a portfolio decision that the
investment company has taken to reduce our high exposure to
energy investments," said a Bechtel spokesman. "We found a
buyer who offered us a good price and we accepted their
offer."

   The affiliate of Bechtel Group Inc. acquired its stake in
Dual about 10 years ago. Dual operates in the Gulf of Mexico
and the U.S. Pacific Ocean, as well as off the coasts of
Brazil, India and Indonesia. Mosvold is a publicly held
company that, with this acquisition, will have about 1,800
employees.
