   In the opening scene of "Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"
Detective John McClane unsuccessfully tries to talk a
sneering airport policeman out of towing his illegally parked
car. Because McClane already had overcome enormous obstacles
in the original "Die Hard," I immediately suspected
(correctly, as it turned out) that he would get his car back
in the end, though there would be much mayhem in between.
   Yet somehow the inevitability that hovered over this film
from the start didn't spoil its pleasures. This is the movie
equivalent of a junk-food binge. It may not be good for you,
but sometimes nothing can taste better than just the right
mixture of grease, salt, sugar and crunch.

   "Die Hard 2" has its own surefire queasiness-inducer:
international terrorism played out at a major American
airport during the Christmas rush, and it is snowing. One
suspects that screenwriters Steven E. de Souza and Doug
Richardson are frequent fliers, because throughout the film
they have astutely milked every real and imagined nightmare
an airplane passenger could have. Among other things, they
and director Renny Harlin have staged a brutally ingenious
dogfight in the baggage area, using luggage as both shield
and weapon.
   As a frequent flier myself I always have had a perverse
fondness for even the worst airport-disaster movies. None has
worked the genre better than this tautly constructed piece of
work.
   Once again Bruce Willis plays McClane with his usual
combination of swagger and gravity and the rueful smirk that
has made him a star. Dropping self-mocking wisecracks as he
springs from heroic act to heroic act, Mr. Willis's McClane
is a blue-collar American James Bond.
   Unlike the Bond films, however, which were a creation of
the '60s, the "Die Hard" pictures have an anti-technological
bent, though they are models of technological wizardry. ("Die
Hard 2" contains some startling special effects.) In the
original, McClane almost singlehandedly thwarts a team of
vicious thieves in a brawl that destroys a modern skyscraper
in an explosion of glass and humanity.
   This time, he alone figures out the monstrous labyrinth
concealed behind the public areas of a vast airport, as he
works to head off a band of terrorists who have deftly
undermined the air traffic control system. And the film
makers make sly use of trendy techno-gear like faxes and
airplane telephones both as plot devices and as the subject
of my favorite line in the film, which won't be revealed
here. And in this sequel, they once again up the ante by
placing the hero's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) in peril.
   Mr. Harlin is the young Finnish director who made his mark
here with "Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master," the
most commercially successful of the "Elm Street" films. Here
again he shows that he knows how to improve on an original,
that he's an aces sequel maker (John McTiernan directed the
first "Die Hard").
   There's no place for nuance in this kind of movie and Mr.
Harlin hasn't included any. Dennis Franz plays the witless
airport police chief with an air of unrelenting myopia.
Journalists, as in "Die Hard," are brainless careerists,
though one female reporter is permitted a brief show of
humanity. The villains are double-dyed monsters.
   Mr. Harlin's fundamental gift is knowing how to induce the
kind of controlled panic that kicks in on action-park rides.
You can giggle at the terror because you can see the man at
the switch, setting the same ride in motion over and over
again. Silly as it is, you'll probably go around yet again,
if the opportunity arises, and you expect that it will.

   "Days of Thunder" tells the story of a stock-car driver
who loses his will to race after an accident but recovers it
and also wins the heart of a beautiful Australian doctor who
conveniently practices medicine near the Daytona
International Race way.
   This didn't turn out to be the bad movie I thought it
would be when early on one character says to another: "If you
build the car I'll find a driver." That bad movie would have
been corny, but it would have had some excitement when the
hero won, then failed, then won again having gained maturity
along the way.
   The movie that director Tony Scott ("Top Gun," "Beverly
Hills Cop II") came up with avoided the usual manipulation
found in this kind of proving-his-manhood kind of movie.
Falling back on his roots in advertising, Mr. Scott has
smoothed over the racetrack world with an airbrush. There is
much talk about the dangers and drama of race-car driving,
but little of it actually appears on screen.
   The movie blurs into a continuum of cars pounding one
another and closeups of faces showing disgust, happiness,
fear and outrage. It's the kind of shorthand imagery that
works best in brief spurts, say, the amount of time it takes
for a television commercial to implant a spark-plug brand
into your brain.
   Dragged out for two hours the imagery becomes boring, and
there is nothing that even skilled actors like Robert Duvall
and Tom Cruise can do to help. Mr. Cruise, who supposedly got
the idea for this movie after driving a race car, was
photographed to look like a soft pretty boy. Millions of
teen-aged girls probably will not be disappointed.

   VIDEO TIP: "Days of Thunder" gave me the urge to look at
some Steve McQueen movies. The late Mr. McQueen raced cars
for fun in life and played men who liked to drive cars as
though they were racing in the movies. The chase sequence in
the detective story "Bullitt" remains nerve-racking, and so
does the chase in "The Getaway." It was a motorcycle in "The
Great Escape" that pushed McQueen into stardom. But McQueen
was his own best engine; take a look at "The Cincinnati Kid,"
"Junior Bonner" -- and my favorite, "The Thomas Crown
Affair."
