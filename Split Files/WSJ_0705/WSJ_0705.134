   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Niagara Exchange Corp. said that the New
York State Department of Insurance disallowed the purchase of
$8.2 million in preferred stock by W.R. Berkley Corp.
   The proposed sale of the 970,000 shares of preferred stock
had been designed, Niagara said, to help replace funds paid
out last year by a Niagara subsidiary on claims arising from
Hurricane Hugo.

   Niagara Chairman Charles J. Clauss said "management is
considering its options and responsibilities in light of the
insurance department's decision." The insurer, which writes
property and casualty insurance, did not elaborate on the
reasons for that decision.
