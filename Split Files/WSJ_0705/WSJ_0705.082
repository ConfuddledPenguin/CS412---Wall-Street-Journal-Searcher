   LONDON -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC said it agreed to sell its
Gartner Group Inc. consultancy business to an investment
vehicle owned by Information Partners L.P. of the U.S. for
$70 million in a mixture of cash and either a promissory note
or shares.
   The sale of Gartner, a Connecticut market information and
product data supplier, forms part of Saatchi's bid to sell
off its consulting businesses in favor of concentrating on
its core communications operations and reducing debt, the
British advertising company said. Last month, Saatchi sold
its Peterson Consulting unit -- for which it paid $116
million -- for less than $20 million.

   Information Partners, a Boston investment group
specializing in communications concerns, is proposing to pay
$55 million in cash and $15 million of either a subordinated
promissory note or exchangeable preferred stock.
   Saatchi, meanwhile, said it is paying an estimated $4
million for an evaluation of Gartner's net asset value.
   The sale is expected to go through within the next six
weeks, the company said.
   Saatchi paid $86 million for Gartner, which it bought in
June 1988.
