   LOS ANGELES -- Two men were sentenced after pleading
guilty in April to a long-running scam involving falsified
test results on millions of nuts and bolts designed to fasten
parts in aircraft engines.
   Norman McHaffie, president of the now-defunct defense
contractor McHaffie Inc. of Sylmar, Calif., was sentenced to
three years in prison and three years' probation and was
fined $750,000. James Hicks, an employee, was sentenced to
one and a half years in prison and two years' probation, and
the company was fined $750,000.

   A third defendant, former shop floor manager William
Whitham, was sentenced June 18 to 20 weekends in prison,
three years' probation and 150 hours of community service
after pleading guilty.
   The government accused the men of participating in a
10-year scheme beginning in 1979 that involved more than
4,000 government and commercial contracts. According to the
government's investigation, the company did not conduct
Pentagon-mandated tests on the products, but went to great
lengths to falsify results and otherwise mask the fraud.
