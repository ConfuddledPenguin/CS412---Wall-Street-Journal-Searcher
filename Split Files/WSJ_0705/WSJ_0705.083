   NEW YORK -- A proposed South African development bank took
a step toward reality when Nelson Mandela met with Peter
Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation.
   "What began as a germ of an idea is now a seedling," Mr.
Goldmark said yesterday after his return to New York.

   Mr. Goldmark had suggested during a New York breakfast
with business leaders for Mr. Mandela June 22 that
corporations and foundations were interested in a mechanism
for channeling investments to South Africa that could begin
to function "the minute a just government is elected."
   Few specifics have been settled, but Mr. Goldmark said
that after an hour's discussion in Mr. Mandela's London hotel
Tuesday it was tentatively decided that the development
bank's objectives for South Africa would be establishment of
an equitable economic structure and investment in roads,
irrigation systems and other development infrastructure.
   Mr. Goldmark said a "core group" was formed to plan the
bank's structure, including himself, African National
Congress Foreign Secretary Thabo Mbeki, and ANC Treasurer
Thomas Nkobi. The Rockefeller Foundation "is only to be of
professional and technical assistance," with central
leadership coming from the South African participants, he
said.
