   WASHINGTON -- Top Bush administration officials are
considering a proposal to impose a tax on the sale of
securities as a way of reducing the budget deficit.
   The so-called securities transfer excise tax, which could
impose a levy of as much as 0.5% on sales of stocks, bonds,
futures contracts and other instruments, is getting serious
consideration in the White House primarily as a way to
satisfy Democrats that the coming tax package won't be a
giveaway to the affluent. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman are said to be intrigued
by the idea, but not committed to it. Administration aides
term the tax a "live option."

   Revenue-raising proposals are popping up all over the
capital now that President Bush has declared that tax
increases are needed to tame the federal deficit. The
proposals that carry the most weight, however, are those
being discussed within the generally anti-tax Bush
administration.
   The fact that the securities tax is being floated by Bush
aides is causing alarm from Wall Street to LaSalle Street.
The Securities Industry Association has written to Secretary
Brady detailing objections to such a tax and asking him to
oppose it. And Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who chairs
the House Ways and Means Committee and is an advocate for the
commodity exchanges, has drawn applause from audiences back
home when he makes a point of saying he intends to fight a
transaction tax.
   The securities tax could offer a way out of a dilemma that
faces the budget negotiators. The Bush administration wants
any tax package to include a cut in the capital-gains rate.
But Democrats in Congress say a capital-gains cut is a
giveaway to the rich. They are demanding that the president
also agree to raise taxes on the wealthy by boosting the top
income-tax rate for high-income Americans to 33% from 28%.
   In an effort to avoid boosting the top tax rate,
administration officials are looking for other ways to tax
the wealthy. The securities transfer excise tax is one
proposal that has caught their attention. Administration
officials note the tax was proposed in 1987 by former House
Speaker James Wright (D., Texas).
   The most often discussed securities tax would impose a
0.5% levy on the value of security sales. To bring in the
most revenue, the tax would be assessed on individuals,
corporations and tax-exempt institutions such as pension
funds. In its broadest form, it would apply to the sale of
stocks, options and debt, with the exception of Treasury
securities. It would also apply to Americans trading on
foreign exchanges.
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that
such a tax would raise $7.8 billion in its first year and
$57.7 billion over five years.
   The budget summit talks between White House aides and
congressional leaders are moving toward a deficit-reduction
pact that would cut about $50 billion from the projected
fiscal 1991 deficit, with about half coming from tax
increases. The securities tax could provide a substantial
chunk of that revenue.
   But whether the tax is actually a tax on the wealthy is
likely to become the source of considerable debate. Pension
funds are among the most active traders of securities, and
they will probably try to portray the tax as a levy on the
retirement funds of working people.
   Officially, the White House is staying mum about its
tax-increase preferences. White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu told reporters Tuesday that the president's tax
statement last week has "gotten the summit started again."
But, he added, administration officials "do not want to
negotiate in public, nor do we want to tip our hands in
public."
   Still, he said, neither he nor other top administration
aides "underestimate the understanding of the American people
that something significant has to be done about the deficit."
   Securities industry lobbyists aren't underestimating the
possibility of a transfer tax. On June 22, two top officials
of the Securities Industry Association wrote to Treasury
Secretary Brady noting with some distress that "a securities
transaction excise tax has resurfaced as a possible revenue
raising measure."
   The letter, signed by the association's chairman, Robert
Downey, and president, Edward O'Brien, went on to state: "We
ask you to oppose this type of tax as a new source of
government revenue. Few other taxes would be as strongly
opposed by our industry, which has witnessed the
deterioration of market liquidity and declining volume since
the 1987 market crash."
   In the past week, Wall Street representatives have combed
Congress to talk about their securities-tax anxiety. To
bolster their case, they are circulating a 1987 study by the
Congressional Research Service that indicated a 0.5% levy
would decrease trading volume and cause a 9.3% decline in
stock prices. "A tax on all stock transfers obviously would
have an adverse effect on the stock market, and the effect
could be larger than might be expected initially based on the
relatively small size of the tax," the report stated. They
also argued that the tax could force trading to go offshore.
   One securities company lobbyist said the industry is so
distressed by the notion of the tax that it might even oppose
a cut in the capital-gains tax if it were linked to a
broad-based securities transfer tax.
   For its part, the commodities industry is focusing its
lobbying energies not on the transfer tax but on trying to
prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking
over the regulation of certain financial contracts from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But still, an industry
lobbyist says, people in commodities "are holding their
breath" about the transaction tax.
   Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of the Senate Finance Committee has
expressed interest in the tax. The Texas Democrat has
publicly said he would consider increasing taxes on
short-term trades as a way to discourage churning of stocks.
Rostenkowski partisans are concerned that Mr. Bentsen's
interest may go beyond such a narrow tax, however. They
foresee the possibility of a battle between the two
tax-writing chairmen over the issue.
   But both Sen. Bentsen and Rep. Rostenkowski have indicated
they would favor an increase in the top income-tax rate if
the capital-gain tax were cut.
