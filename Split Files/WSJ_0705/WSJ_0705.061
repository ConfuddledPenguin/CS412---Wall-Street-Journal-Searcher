   CLEVELAND -- Sudbury Inc.'s president and chief executive
officer, Douglas F. Johnston, resigned along with two other
board members, in what the company described as a "major
difference of opinion" over its management and strategic
course.
   Ross D. Lake, 52 years old, who had held the No. 2
position at the automotive-parts maker, was named by
directors to succeed the dismissed Mr. Johnston, 59.

   Mr. Johnston had been recruited two years ago to turn
around Sudbury and craft a new strategy. But while declining
to cite the board's specific disagreements with that
strategy, the company's corporate secretary Robert G. Kuhbach
said a majority of directors had a different vision of "how
to return the company to profitability." The resignations of
Mr. Johnston and board members William C. Scott and Thomas C.
Sutton leave six remaining directors.
   Sudbury, which makes dashboard padding, cast car parts and
other components for the automobile industry, has been
unprofitable in recent years. It recently said it expects to
report net income of about $2 million for the year ended May
31, reflecting a $10 million extraordinary gain. Sales were
about $500 million, it said.
