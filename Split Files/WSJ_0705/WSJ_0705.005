   Tim W. Ferguson, in vainly attempting to persuade
Californians to vote against their rail-bond issues ("The
Golden State Assays the Golden Spike," Business World, June
5), supports "buses, jitneys and high-speed lanes for group
vehicles" as alternatives to rail systems.
   Jitneys and group vehicles, however, cannot handle a big
part of urban-transportation demand without bogging down in
their own gridlock. The Asian cities known for jitneys now
have rail systems, too.

   And many potential rail commuters won't ride a bus. The
fare box covers only 30% of the operating costs of the
much-touted Shirley Highway buses vs. Washington Metro's 75%,
Philadelphia-Lindenwold's 85% and San Diego Trolley's 95%.
   Mr. Ferguson's column included a Department of
Transportation table comparing projected and actual ridership
on new rail systems. The table misses the point. Rail systems
are built for the long term. Who cares now how many rode
Boston's first subway when it was two years old?
   Moreover, ridership on most of the cited systems has risen
since the Department of Transportation went to press.
Sacramento is up 53%, Washington 27% (from 411,600 to
524,000]), Pittsburgh 15%, Miami 13%. Pittsburgh system
managers say they lack the capacity to handle the 90,500
riders the Department of Transportation claims were projected
for their light rail system.
   The suggestion that "development sprawl and the
flexibility of the personal car allow individuals and
employers to find their way around (traffic) jams" is hardly
a basis on which to build public policy. It ignores the needs
of people without cars, the environmental costs of auto
dependence and the oil-import crisis toward which we are
"driving."

   Mr. Ferguson offered fear of and loathing for California's
recent vote for higher gasoline taxes for rail transit. He
cites "horrendous cost overruns" of new systems as evidence
that the case for rail transit is overstated.
   His thesis is off the track. The "evidence" of projected
vs. actual ridership and costs in the accompanying table is
deceptive, and he misses entirely the salient point of rail
transit's importance to our economy and an urban area's
quality of life.
   The numbers, circulated by the Department of
Transportation in its tiresome campaign to discredit rail
transit, are mostly outdated projections made during the very
early planning stages of these projects. Also, only a select
few projects were cited in the table, ones that conveniently
fit the anti-rail argument. Where are the numbers for San
Francisco's popular BART, the successful Boston and Chicago
extensions or the respected San Diego Trolley that recovers
90% of its operating costs from paying passengers?
   If rail transit has been the bust Mr. Ferguson seems to
think it is, then why are so many communities eager to pay
more taxes to strengthen their rail systems with extensions?
I think it is because they recognize rail transit's multiple,
attractive qualities and overall investment worthiness.
Cities decide to build rail systems for many reasons, not
just cost and ridership. Some, like Buffalo and Miami, use
rail to spur private development; others want its clean-air
benefits; some seek to speed travel time for commuters
without adding to roadway congestion. All understand that the
operating costs of rail transit -- per passenger mile -- are
significantly lower than those of buses.
   David Alan Aschauer, while with the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago, first drew attention to the strong link between
America's sinking level of public works and transportation
investment and our laggard productivity, especially in
contrast to our transit-wise trading partners.
   Certainly it is in the federal interest to see that the
traveling public and the private sector get the modern
transportation infrastructure essential to prosperity at home
and the improvement of our position internationally.
   Instead of bashing rail transit with phony numbers, Mr.
Ferguson and the Journal should acknowledge that the
California ballot victories are solid evidence of a growing
public recognition of mass transit's key role in our future
mobility and our economic and environmental progress.
