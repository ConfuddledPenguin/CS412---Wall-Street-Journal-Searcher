   REUTER INC.'S National Market System short position in the
month to midJune was 9,941, not the 512,341 shares listed in
the June 27 edition. Reuters Holdings PLC's National Market
System short position in the month to mid-June was 2,734,527,
not 2,232,127 as reported in the same edition. The incorrect
numbers were due to a reporting error by a Nasdaq member
firm.

   WILLIAMS-SONOMA Inc. sold ex-distribution Monday and
closed in national overthe-counter trading at $25.125, after
adjustment for a 3-for-2 stock split. Failure to make the
stock split adjustment caused the company to be mistakenly
listed as a Price Percentage Loser in Tuesday's edition.

   JOHN GORDON of Deltec Securities Corp., who heads a
steering committee of Southland Corp. security holders, said
issues remain between security holders and Southland
regarding a revised debt exchange offer by the company. In
Tuesday's edition, Mr. Gordon was quoted as saying he was
favorably impressed by the exchange offer's details. Mr.
Gordon said his comments related only to the relative
allocation of values among various security holder groups and
not to the overall amount being offered by Southland.
