   Aztar Corp. said the Nevada Supreme Court upheld a
judgment ordering the casino company to pay $33 million to
settle a contract dispute involving its 1979 purchase of the
Las Vegas Tropicana casino-hotel.
   Aztar, which changed its name from Ramada Inc. last year
after selling hotel and restaurant operations, said it may
petition for a rehearing. The Phoenix company posted a $33
million bond supported by a bank letter of credit after the
initial ruling in May 1989, but said the judgment would be
paid out of available company funds if the order stands.

   The lower court awarded Hotel Conquistador Inc. and its
holders $14,225,000 with 14% interest from January 1982, plus
attorney's fees and other costs, in a dispute over the price
of the Tropicana.
   Harold Gewerter, an attorney for Hotel Conquistador and
holders including Mitzi Stauffer Briggs, Ed Doumani and
members of his family, said the judgment funds will
eventually wend their way into federal Bankruptcy Court,
which is overseeing a reorganization of Hotel Conquistador.
