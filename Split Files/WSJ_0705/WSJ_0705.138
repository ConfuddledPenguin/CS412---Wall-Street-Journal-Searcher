   TCF Financial Corp. said it will report a $32 million loss
for the second quarter as a result of restructuring that
includes the termination of what it called "poorly conceived
expansion" efforts.
   The Minneapolis-based thrift institution said it will take
a $13.1 million write-off in closing its Texas unit, TCF Banc
Savings. Balance-sheet restructuring also includes the sale
of $137 million of mortgage-backed securities at a gain of
$10.1 million and the sale of $28 million of collateralized
mortgage obligations at a loss of $14.4 million.

   "We believe these actions bring to a close TCF's poorly
conceived expansion into Texas and the national commercial
lending markets, and will reduce interest rate risk," said
William A. Cooper, chairman and chief executive officer of
the thrift. He said TCF expects to return to profitability in
the second half.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, TCF earned $5.5
million, or 75 cents a share, which included gains from tax
benefits and a pension plan settlement.
