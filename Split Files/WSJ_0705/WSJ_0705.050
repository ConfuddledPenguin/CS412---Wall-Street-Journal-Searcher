   WASHINGTON -- President Bush plans to propose, at a
meeting of Western leaders opening today in London, that
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev be invited to address the
Western military alliance, diplomatic sources said.
   The idea of inviting the Soviet leader to visit the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is included in a package of
proposals Mr. Bush privately has recommended for discussion
among the Western allies during the two-day London meeting.
The proposals are designed to make the Western defense
alliance appear less threatening to the Kremlin so that Mr.
Gorbachev will acquiesce to a newly united Germany becoming a
full NATO member.

   A visit by Mr. Gorbachev to NATO would be largely
symbolic, but it could be important. Bringing the Soviet
leader inside a military alliance that was formed to defend
against a Soviet threat would be a powerful way of
underscoring the West's contention that the Kremlin has
nothing to fear from NATO or German membership in it.
   The proposal would dovetail with another of Mr. Bush's
proposals -- that the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact be
allowed to send permanent representatives to NATO
headquarters to observe the alliance's activities.
   Already, in one gesture of openness toward the Kremlin,
NATO hosted Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on a
similar trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier this
year. It isn't clear when Mr. Gorbachev, who is enduring
heavy criticism at a Soviet Communist Party Congress this
week, would visit NATO, the diplomatic sources said.
   Other proposals Mr. Bush plans to present are designed to
alter NATO's military structure in response to the collapse
of communism in Eastern Europe without so radically
overhauling the alliance that its power fades away. Allies
were given a preview of the ideas in a letter distributed
late last week.
   Mr. Bush plans to propose, for instance, that NATO and the
Warsaw Pact each issue non-aggression statements, diplomatic
sources said. Such statements have been suggested as another
way to illustrate that NATO hasn't any hostile intentions
toward the Soviet Union.
   And the president will propose declaring that the U.S. is
prepared to withdraw hundreds of its nuclear-tipped artillery
shells from Western Europe, provided Soviet troops are
withdrawn from Eastern Europe. The short-range shells have
little use because they are designed to strike East European
countries that no longer pose an immediate military threat to
the West.
   The U.S. also will suggest that the NATO leaders endorse a
plan, already discussed in other alliance meetings, to thin
out the ranks of NATO troops on the alliance's front line and
put them under multinational commands made up of officers
from several alliance nations.
   In addition, the sources said, Mr. Bush plans to suggest
several steps to strengthen the Conference for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, an organization designed to ease
political tensions on the Continent. He plans to suggest
creating a conflict-resolution office within the CSCE,
strengthening the leadership of the organization and creating
a CSCE committee to monitor elections being held in newly
democratized nations in Eastern Europe.
