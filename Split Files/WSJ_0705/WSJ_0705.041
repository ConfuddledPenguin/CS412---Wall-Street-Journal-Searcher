   MINNEAPOLIS -- ADC Telecommunications Inc. said that it
acquired American Lightwave Systems Inc., a maker of
fiber-optic video transmission equipment and a 65%-owned unit
of LPL Technologies Inc., Wallingford, Conn., for $10.7
million, and that it agreed to make "certain guaranteed and
contingent payments over a 3 1/2-year period" totaling at
least $4 million.
   ADC, which acquired LPL's 65% stake and certain American
Lightwave employees' 35% holding, said the transaction "adds
significantly" to its fiber-optic capabilities and "positions
us to participate in the fast-growing video-services delivery
market." ADC said it and American Lightwave are cooperating
in providing field trials with major telephone companies of
voice and video systems.
