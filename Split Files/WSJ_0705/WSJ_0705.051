   In case you haven't noticed, we're all getting older. The
postwar baby boom has ended. A woman reaching childbearing
age in 1960 would expect 3.6 children; in 1990, only 1.9. I'm
always a little nervous talking about six-tenths of a child
or even nine-tenths of one, but that's the way demography
works.
   Demographers, economists and a lot of politicians have
been worrying for several years about the burdens this older
population will inflict on America -- particularly on the
post-baby boom generation. Those who pay Social Security
taxes will be decreasing in numbers and the baby boomers will
be sliding into retirement.

   In the past decade this raised fears for the future of the
Social Security system. Keeping the system going, and keeping
the checks flowing, might require such large tax increases
that workers would rebel. There was no sign of imminent
rebellion, but the average American usually doesn't know what
demographers have in mind. In any case, the perceived problem
led the government to appoint a commission to study the
matter and propose solutions.
   Before long there was a schedule of higher Social Security
taxes. For the next 30 years tax payments are slated to
exceed benefits, with the surplus piling up in a trust fund.
After 2020 the fund would be drawn down as the population
aged. There has been a great deal of concern that Americans
aren't saving enough, but through the tax system the public
is saving, whether it wants to or not.
   Now at hand, however, is a study by four economists, David
Cutler and James Poterba of MIT and Louise Sheiner and
Lawrence Summers of Harvard, that suggests we may have
worried too much about the after-effects of the baby boom.
   For one thing, the end of the baby boom means not only
more old folks but -- guess what? -- fewer babies. The
decline in the number of dependent children, moreover, will
come before the surge in the number of dependent elderly.
Furthermore, the fraction of the labor force either at or
near peak productivity will increase. Between 2010 and 2060,
the total work force will decrease slightly, making it
possible to reduce investment without reducing capital
investment per worker.
   All in all, the authors suggest, a declining work force
may be good for productivity. They offer a study of 29
countries in the years 1960-85. Over that period, the
countries with slow labor-force growth had above average
productivity growth. The authors don't claim this analysis is
any more than a theory, but it does make sense. A
fast-growing labor force normally has lots of very young
workers, short on training as well as experience.
   In addition to helping to care for dependent children and
the elderly, savings are supposed to fuel the investment that
provides jobs and keeps the economy growing. During the
low-savings 1980s, this gap was largely filled by investment
from abroad. There has been some concern that this inflow
will diminish, making it necessary to generate more domestic
savings, but the MIT-Harvard economists are optimistic. They
note that in other countries, notably Japan and West Germany,
the populations will age faster and the work forces will grow
more slowly than in the U.S., so other nations are likely to
continue to seek investment opportunities in the U.S.
   Finally, the economists note that one argument for
reducing the federal budget deficit is that it would increase
national saving. There are arguments for reducing the
deficits; otherwise, all of those congressmen and
administration officials wouldn't be bothering with all of
those current meetings in Washington. But demography does not
dictate a budget reduction, at least not immediately. Over
the next three decades, in fact, the gradual aging of the
population is likely to lead to higher rates of personal
saving. A few months do not a trend make, of course, but the
saving rate last year bounced up to 6%.
   The MIT-Harvard economists don't come right out and attack
the Social Security trust fund, but their analysis surely
damages some of the arguments for the big fund buildup. A key
argument is that, without the buildup, the post-boom workers
will be faced by big tax increases to pay benefits to the
boom generation's retirees, a result that the Social Security
planners obviously found to be unfair.
   The MIT-Harvard authors, however, believe that the boom
generation deserves some special treatment. During their
working years, wage growth is slow because of low
capital-labor ratios. During their retirement years, the
number of potential purchasers of capital will fall, reducing
the rate of return on savings. Studies suggest a sharp
decline in the inflation-adjusted prices of houses, causing a
substantial transfer of wealth to people who are now very
young.
   At the same time, as noted, productivity is likely to be
growing, which should mean that the post-boom generation will
be more affluent than its predecessors. There may be
arguments for piling up that Social Security surplus, but
fairness to the postboomers isn't the most persuasive one.
   Some population scholars argue that it would be nice if we
could get another baby boom going to spread the burden of
caring for the growing numbers of elderly. The authors argue
strongly against such an approach: "Dependency at the
beginning of the life cycle is between 50% and 100% as costly
as dependency at the end of the life cycle. It also comes 60
years earlier."
   In sum, the aging of America presents some problems. It's
nice to know, though, that it also offers us some
opportunities.
