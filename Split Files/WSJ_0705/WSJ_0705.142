   HOUSTON -- For the first time ever, oil companies are
spending more exploration dollars overseas than in the U.S.
and now hold more foreign crude reserves than domestic
reserves, an Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. study found.
   The movement overseas is part of a continuing shift in
emphasis that comes in the face of declining U.S. oil output
and expectations of "increased reliance on imports," said
Victor A. Burk, managing director of the oil practice at
Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm.

   In 1989, exploration and development spending by the 236
public companies in the survey rose 7% to $39.2 billion, the
third consecutive annual increase. A 20% rise in foreign
spending last year to $21.9 billion primarily accounted for
the overall rise in expenditures, Arthur Andersen said.
   Exploration overseas is done mostly by major companies,
but smaller ones are beginning to participate, too.
Generally, companies say, geology outside the U.S. favors the
potential for big discoveries, and tax treatment and other
inducements also can be more favorable.
   Arthur Andersen compiled 1989 data from Securities and
Exchange Commission filings from oil companies with more than
one million barrels of reserves. The vast majority of the
companies are based in the U.S., and a few are foreign but
have large U.S. reserves, such as British Petroleum Co., or
are Canadian.
   A decline of more than $8 a barrel in crude oil prices
this year and depressed natural gas prices won't slow the
exploration spending increases, Mr. Burk said, viewing them
as temporary. "Managements of most companies look at things
on a long-term basis," he said. "They look at things three to
five to 10 years ahead, and not what they see now."
   Many oil industry officials believe that world oil demand
will continue to grow and that production in many countries
will shrink, boosting prices in this decade. Arthur Andersen
estimated that U.S. oil production, for example, will drop by
400,000 barrels a day this year and by one million barrels a
day by 1995. Just since 1986, domestic output has fallen 17%,
or 1.8 million barrels a day.
   While production declines, U.S. demand will rise 1% a
year, or about one million barrels a day between now and
1995, the accounting firm predicted. Demand is growing more
rapidly elsewhere. Mr. Burk said that Japanese oil demand is
expanding about 4% annually, and that in developing countries
such as South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan, growth
exceeds 6% a year.
   Mr. Burk said it is unclear what effect energy demand in
Eastern Europe may have on world oil markets in coming years,
though many specialists predict more growth if the economies
in that region expand. Oil production from the Soviet Union
fell about 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day last year and a
similar decline is expected this year.
   But Mr. Burk said he doesn't expect another oil crisis.
"We are not in the same situation we were in in the 1970s,"
he said. This time, the oil producing countries, mostly in
the Middle East, "are looking for security of demand, just as
we are looking for security of supply," he said.
   The shift overseas by the largest companies has provided
opportunities for smaller ones in the U.S., and domestic
drilling activity is rising. "The environment we are in today
is the best environment we have seen for independents in four
or five years," Mr. Burk said.
   These smaller companies have been acquiring reserves and
acreage from major oil companies and have been able to use
technological advances and their already lower operating
costs to find new oil and gas opportunities, he said.
   The survey found that for the second consecutive year, the
industry increased its U.S. natural gas reserves, which rose
6% in 1989. This reflects increased gas drilling "based on
expectations gas prices will improve as demand increases in
coming years," Arthur Andersen said. U.S. gas output rose 4%
in 1989 to the highest level in five years, the survey found.
