   West Germany's Siemens AG said it will own 78% of the
surviving company following the planned merger of its Data &amp;
Information Systems division with Nixdorf Computer AG.
   In April, Siemens acquired 51% of the voting shares of the
financially troubled West German computer group and plans to
merge it with the Data &amp; Information Systems division.

   The merger is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1.
   The resulting company, Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme
AG, would have world-wide sales of around 12 billion marks
($7.26 billion), making it one of Europe's largest
information technology groups.
   Under terms of the merger, Siemens will swap the Data &amp;
Information Systems unit for 26.3 million newly issued
Nixdorf voting shares carrying a total nominal value of 1.32
billion marks. Siemens already owns 11.2 million Nixdorf
voting shares.
   Siemens added that two independent auditors valued Nixdorf
at 3.02 billion marks, while the Siemens division was
estimated to be worth 7.1 billion marks.
