   Sunday, July 8, 1:55 p.m.-3 p.m. EDT, on TNT: World Cup
soccer final from Rome.
                                                                                                       

   Sundays, beginning July 8, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: "Women in
Politics." The first segment of this three-part BBC series
somewhat breathlessly chronicles Corazon Aquino's
transformation from homebody to president of the Philippines.
President Aquino herself sizes matters up nicely, noting, "If
I were not the widow of Ninoy, I don't think anyone would
have paid attention to me." Unlike members of this year's
graduating class at Wellesley, Philippine citizens found
little to object to in a woman whose status had been derived
entirely from the man she was married to, as they showed by
electing her president. Sparse in the hard-question
department, when not being altogether reverential, the
portrait of Mrs. Aquino is nonetheless interesting biography.
Much less so, however, than that of the prime minister of
Dominica, Eugenia Charles, a considerably more compelling
personality. Both are covered in the first installment, which
repeats at midnight. Encore, July 14 at 1 p.m.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, July 9, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT: "Sweet Revenge," a
mildly engaging farce about a divorcee (Carrie Fisher) forced
to pay alimony to her former husband. The main attraction is
a performance by Rosanna Arquette, as an Audrey Hepburnish
type on the loose in Paris.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, July 9, 9-10 p.m. EDT: "American Masters -- John
Cassavetes," an informative documentary about the director of
"Shadows," "Faces," "A Woman Under the Influence" and other
"independent" films. Cassavetes, who died last year at age
59, is praised as the director who was unafraid to torture
his audiences -- and in some of the scenes on display here,
we can see why.
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, July 10, 10-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates
and times vary, so check local listings): "Alive From Off
Center-Postcards," a playlet by Mark Rappaport about parted
lovers, which has but one thing in its favor -- several
different recorded versions of the gorgeous Cole Porter song,
"Every Time We Say Goodbye I Die a Little," which can be
heard almost throughout the entire play.
                                                                                                       

   Thursday, July 12, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Northern
Exposure." The first segment of this new series by the
doctor-fixated creators of "St. Elsewhere" details the trials
of a physician only slightly older than Doogie Howser, posted
to a remote Alaskan village for reasons too baroque to go
into here. En route, a fellow traveler lets him know that he
is in for it, with this venture to Alaska. So, as it turns
out, are we. Salvaged somewhat by a scenic locale and the
adult presence of John Cullum.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, July 15 and Monday, July 16, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on
NBC: "Love and Hate," a first-class, fact-based drama that
would stand out in any season, to say nothing of the
wasteland of the summer. Kate Nelligan is entirely compelling
in this chilling story (a Canadian import) of a marriage gone
bad.
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, July 17, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "P.O.V. --
Letter to the Next Generation." The sad tale of a 40ish '60s
veteran -- the film maker -- who looks at today's student
generation and finds confirmation of his long-held suspicion:
that his was the only truly noble and heroic generation of
young people in modern times. He makes a pilgrimage to Kent
State, site of the fatal 1970 encounter between National
Guardsmen and protesting students, and is astounded to
discover that there actually are undergraduates now who have
grown tired of the cult of martyrdom surrounding the slain
students. And some who even think the Guardsmen may not have
been all evil and the students not all blameless. Such
responses all are grist for Joe Klein's ode to the glories of
his generation: a journey into narcissism that doubtless will
be of interest both to other veterans of the '60s and their
psychiatrists.
