   NEW YORK -- Investors bid stock and bond prices higher
Tuesday, but without much enthusiasm as many traders took off
early for the Independence Day holiday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its fifth
consecutive rise, gaining 12.37 points to 2911.63. Treasury
bond prices rose slightly and the dollar was mixed.

   In the stock market, investors continued searching for
"the earnings-reliable issues, while we wait to see how the
tax negotiations are resolved between Bush and the
Democrats," said Jack Solomon, market technician at Bear
Stearns.
   Though the Dow Jones industrials have climbed nearly 70
points, or 2.4%, in five sessions, Mr. Solomon said, "This is
one of the crummiest rallies I've ever seen."
   Among the best performers were shares of environmental and
chemical-control companies -- such as Waste Management and
Browning-Ferris Industries -- and pharmaceuticals and
health-case concerns -- a grouping that prompted Mr. Solomon
to remark, "It was a social-welfare Tuesday." Profit-taking
was evident in such technology stocks as Compaq and
International Business Machines.
   Activity is slipping even among the blue-chip stocks that
many investors have been favoring. Volume in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's 30 stocks fell to 12.3 million shares
Monday and 13.9 million Tuesday from the roughly 20
million-share level of early to mid-June.
   Many investors are holding back now, awaiting tomorrow's
disclosure of the June employment report for signs of
continued economic sluggishness. Many investors hope that if
the unemployment rate inches up, the Federal Reserve will
ease interest rates to keep the recession at bay.
   The jobs report also is being awaited in the bond market,
where trading was very light Tuesday. Brian Fabbri, chief
economist at Midland Montagu Economics, suggested traders
won't make any major new moves until the report comes out.
Investors ignored news Tuesday of larger-than-expected
government debt offerings scheduled for next week.
   The dollar drifted lower Tuesday against some major
currencies, with the pound continuing to gain on the
expectation that the U.K. currency will soon become fully
integrated in the European Monetary System. The German mark
held its own, having survived monetary union.
   "As yet, the decline in the dollar hasn't hurt U.S.
security prices," said Mr. Fabbri. "I think partly because
what's gone on is endemic to individual countries."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in light volume of 130.1 million shares
on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancers outnumbered
decliners, 834 to 650.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose one-eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each
$1,000 face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.38%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading Tuesday,
the currency was unchanged at 1.6505 marks and rose to 150.90
yen from 150.83 yen Monday.
