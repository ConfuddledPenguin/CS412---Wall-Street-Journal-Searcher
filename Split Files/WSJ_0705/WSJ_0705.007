   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson is going far
beyond Band-Aids to patch up worker safety.
   The maker of the adhesive bandages and other health-care
products is redoubling its efforts in an intensive campaign
to become No. 1 in safety. But it won't be an easy feat.
Pinning together its campaign is a set of strict rules
determining how a workplace accident is handled -- rules that
haven't always gone down easily with middle management.

   To win, Johnson &amp; Johnson must replace Du Pont Co., long
the acknowledged leader in preventing worker accidents and
work-related illnesses. Both companies appear to have in
common a zeal for workplace safety from the top down. "The
common denominator of safety excellence is a company's
culture, which is determined by its chief executive officer,"
says Charles Hurley, a former National Safety Council
official.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson's big push comes amid signs of a hotter
regulatory spotlight on the issue; 1990s corporations and
regulators may have to do more to make the workplace safe. In
the 1980s, Reagan-administration deregulation turned a lot of
such spotlights off.
   The Reagan policies led many employers to relax worker
safety. Patrick Tyson, an official of the Labor Department's
Office of Safety and Health Administration in the early
Reagan years and now an occupational safety and health lawyer
in Atlanta, was a witness. He recalls: "Industry was given
the opportunity to do what they said they wanted to do." In
short, they wanted to show how good their safety programs
could be without being hogtied by federal regulation. OSHA's
inspection force was slashed.
   "Almost inevitably, with very few exceptions . . .
industry responded with tremendous cuts in safety and health
staffs," Mr. Tyson says, and safety and health "went to
hell." Many employers, through most of the decade,
underreported worker injuries and on-the-job illnesses.
   But now, Mr. Tyson says, companies are "paying for" their
policies in stiff fines and tougher enforcement which began
when Bill Brock became Mr. Reagan's second Labor secretary,
and which has been escalating since, most lately under
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and OSHA Chief Gerard Scannell.
   Some recent OSHA targets have been big. OSHA has proposed
fines of $5.7 million against Phillips Petroleum Co.,
stemming from explosions last October at a Houston-area
plastics plant that killed 23 workers, and $7.3 million for
health and safety violations by USX Corp. at two plants; OSHA
cited Phillips internal documents "that called for corrective
action but which were largely ignored," and alleged
"corporate indifference to worker safety and health" by USX.
Phillips and USX are contesting the fines.
   Lately, reported injury rates have been climbing, which
OSHA says reflects a trend toward more accurate reporting;
many of its big fines have been for bad record-keeping.
   But Johnson &amp; Johnson swam against the prevailing Eighties
current, Mr. Tyson notes. Even in the most
deregulation-obsessed days of the Reagan administration, the
company was aggressively trying to improve workplace safety.
Leading the effort was Mr. Scannell, who was brought in as
safety director by then-President David Clare and who spent a
decade at the company. He left OSHA in 1979 to join the
health-care products maker; when he switched back to the
agency in 1989, it was to become OSHA chief.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson's pre-Scannell policies were a lot
looser. Routine yearly reports on injuries were about all
that was required. "They talked a little about safety, but
they never did very much," says Mr. Tyson.
   Mr. Scannell found his job cut out for him: Among the
sloppy and unreliable recording of workplace injuries, nine
pregnancies were logged as illnesses.
   So, over a period of years, the company worked out tough
workplace-safety rules. When any workplace accident causes a
death, or an amputation, fracture, head injury or burn
resulting in at least one lost workday, the head of the
company unit involved must file a written report to the
company's top management within 24 hours. The head person
then has to travel to company headquarters in New Brunswick
and personally explain, to a top-level management committee,
what went wrong.
   The result of such efforts: Johnson &amp; Johnson has slashed
its annual lost workday incidence, or LWDI, rate, per 100
workers to 0.14 last year from 1.81 in 1981. These are the
rates of job-related injuries or illnesses that force
employees to lose at least a full workday.
   By contrast, the lost workday case rate for 14 large
competing pharmaceutical concerns in 1988 was 1.20. Overall
rates for the pharmaceutical industry and the surgical
appliances and supplies industry, in which Johnson &amp; Johnson
competes, were much higher than that, government reports
show.
   The company's rate has flattened out over the past few
years. So Johnson &amp; Johnson is redoubling efforts. Ralph
Larsen, the new chairman, has picked up the torch, setting a
company goal of "an injury-free work environment." Johnson &amp;
Johnson will adopt some new methods: designing safety into
production equipment, spotting accident "near-misses" and
eliminating their causes, and urging workers to report safety
violations.
   The rigid mandate for injury reports and other Johnson &amp;
Johnson safety edicts has often riled managers, particularly
in overseas subsidiaries where safety traditions are
sometimes far weaker. When a company worker in Kenya lost an
arm in a textile machine in 1987, the manager complained to
Mr. Scannell that flying to New Brunswick used up a year's
travel budget. The manager made the trip anyway.
   Many U.S. and foreign managers once protested a plan by
Mr. Scannell to equip all plants and offices with sprinklers
to give workers time to escape a fire. One official said the
estimated $100 million cost would be too much at the same
time the company was involved in a costly recall of its
Tylenol headache capsules because of the poisoned-Tylenol
scare. Chairman James Burke, recently retired, asked: While
the company is protecting its customers, "can we do less for
our employees?" The sprinkler project went on.
   While its overall safety numbers look good, there are some
rough spots. One union official, David Presseisen, president
of Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Local 630, which
represents several Johnson &amp; Johnson facilities, praises the
company's efforts. But Eric Frumin, an official of the same
union, insists that safety performance at its nonunion
facilities "varies a lot, and can be terrible."
   A nonunion Noramco plant in Delaware, for example, has had
an LWDI rate of 1.983 in 1987 and 1.738 in 1988 -- far worse
than the overall corporation's rate. Johnson &amp; Johnson
figures show that it had many U.S. union and nonunion plants
with no lost workdays in 1987 and 1988; for the others, the
nonunion performance was somewhat worse than at union plants,
but rates for even nonunion plants were mostly below 1.0.
   Currently, OSHA investigators are looking into some
possible record-keeping violations at another Johnson &amp;
Johnson plant.
   And Johnson &amp; Johnson has a ways to overtake Du Pont. The
chemical-products conglomerate's mainline operations have had
LWDI rates of 0.048, 0.038 and 0.05 in 1987, 1988 and 1989,
respectively. Fully 14 Du Pont plants with more than 10
million hours without a lost workday are on the National
Safety Council's honor roll; two had a string of more than 40
million hours.
   Still, Du Pont has its share of detractors. William Golt,
president of the Chemical Workers Association, a unit of a Du
Pont company union at Deep Water, N.J., contends that Du
Pont, like many employers, tries to hold down its injury-rate
figures by keeping injured employees on the job when they
shouldn't be working. The company denies this.
