   NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended modestly higher in quiet
trading Tuesday, unaffected by news of three large government
bond offerings scheduled to be auctioned next week.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended more than 1/8
point higher, a gain of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased to 8.38%. Corporate and
municipal bonds were unchanged to as much as 3/8 point higher
while mortgage-backed securities were little changed.

   Following recommendations made by the Public Securities
Association, many bond dealers closed their trading desks at
2 p.m. on Tuesday, three hours earlier than usual. Financial
markets were closed all day Wednesday in observance of
Independence Day.
   Bond prices opened slightly lower Tuesday at levels
reached during overnight trading in Tokyo. But prices slowly
recuperated throughout the day and remained at the higher
levels even as the government announced it will sell $31
billion of securities next week.
   The Treasury Department said it will auction $5 billion of
30-year "bailout bonds" next Tuesday for the Resolution
Funding Corp., the federal agency that raises money to fund
the government's thrift bailout efforts.
   In preliminary "when-issued" trading activity, which
kicked off at noon Tuesday following the Refcorp
announcement, the 30-year bailout bonds were quoted at yields
of 8.81%, 0.40 percentage point higher than yields on the
Treasury's benchmark 30year bond.
   The government also said it will sell a record $18 billion
in short-term Treasury bills next Monday and a record $8
billion of seven-year Treasury notes next Wednesday.
   Bond prices held firm after the auction announcements,
apparently because so few dealers and investors were
available to trade on the news. Often, bond prices fall --
and yields rise -- when there is news of additional supply as
dealers cut prices and clear out existing securities to make
room for new securities.
   Analysts said the market remains vulnerable to such news,
even though the fallout from the approaching supply may not
be felt until later this week or even next week.
   "There is a fair amount of securities to bid on next
week," said Stephen Slifer, money market economist at
Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. "Everywhere you
look there's supply, and there has to be some limit to how
much we can take with interest rates at current levels.
People could rebel a bit and push rates higher."
   Although the deluge of new supply has been a continuing
issue in the credit markets, of more immediate concern is the
June employment report.
   If the employment report is as weak or weaker than the
previous two monthly reports, some analysts believe the
Federal Reserve will come under pressure to ease interest
rates by reducing the federal funds rates. Federal funds, the
rate banks charge each other on overnight loans, is one of
the few interest rates that is directly influenced by the
Federal Reserve.
   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,
expects employment growth in June to total around 100,000
workers (excluding temporary census workers), which he
considers weak enough to trigger an easing move by the Fed.
   "There is very little vitality in the economy," said Mr.
Robertson. He said that recent weak economic data, "coupled
with the hope of a deficit reduction package should persuade
the Fed that they can ease policy a little without running
the risk of inflation."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Most Treasury notes and bonds ended about 1/8 point higher
on Tuesday.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 28/32
to yield 8.38% on Tuesday compared with 103 23/32 to yield
8.40% on Monday.
   Short-term rates were slightly lower than levels set at
Monday's auction. The discount rate on three-month Treasury
bills ended at about 7.70% for a bond equivalent yield of
7.94%, down from a rate of 7.73% to yield 7.99% at Monday's
auction. The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills ended
at 7.59% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.98%, slightly lower
than Monday's auction rate of 7.60% and yield of 8.01%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of TW Food Services Inc. posted solid gains
on news that the firm's holding company refinanced part of
its bank debt. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk corporate
securities that have low credit ratings or no credit rating
at all.
   Analysts said news of the refinancing package boosted bond
prices by removing near-term concerns about TW Holding Inc.'s
ability to make future bank payments.
   TW Food Services's 17% senior subordinated debentures, due
in 2001, ended the day at 49 1/2, up one point. The 15%
subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, also rose one
point to 100 1/4.
   The bonds of debt-strapped Southland Corp., which operates
the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, held on to gains made
early Tuesday after the company revised and sweetened a
debt-exchange offer.
   Under terms of the revised plan, Southland offered
bondholders and preferred stock holders 18 1/2% of the
company's common stock.
   Southland 15.75% senior subordinated notes, due in 1997,
ended one point higher at 23.
   The junk bonds of casinos operated by real estate
developer Donald Trump were mixed in light trading. Trump Taj
Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first-mortgage bonds due in 1998
finished the session at 52 1/2, down 3/8 point on the
American Stock Exchange.
   Trump Castle Funding Inc.'s 13.75% first-mortgage bonds
maturing in 1997 fell 1 5/8 points to 60 5/8. The Trump
Castle second-mortgage bonds maturing in 1999 gained 1 1/2
points to end the day at 38 1/2.
   In the broader market, most junk bonds were little
changed.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 3/8 point
higher, outperforming many other sectors of the bond market.
   Although trading was sluggish, some dealers said they were
impressed with the market's firm tone, which they attributed
partly to President Bush's call for tax revenue increases to
help trim the federal budget deficit. Speculation that taxes
are heading higher has boosted the appeal of tax-exempt
municipal bonds.
   In the new-issue market, Rhode Island and Providence
Plantation's $150 million general obligation tax anticipation
notes were priced by a Shawmut Bank group to yield 6%.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds due 2018 ended unchanged at 98 3/4 to yield
7.28%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   In foreign bond markets, the U.S. holiday helped make for
a largely subdued day in European trading.
   The major news in Europe was West Germany's expected
offering of German Unity Fund bonds. The proceeds from the
issue will be invested in East Germany.
   The German government issued of 6 billion marks ($3.63
billion) of 8.75% bonds due July 20, 2000, priced at 101 to
yield 8.60%.
   In Japan, government bond market ended firmer on a
stronger yen and rising expectations that there will be an
ease in U.S. monetary policy.
   At the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
yield on the benchmark 4.8% issue of 1999 was at 7.2%, down
0.85 percentage point from Tuesday's close. The price was up
0.40, at 86.95.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were virtually
unmoved.
   In the primary arena for mortgage-backed securities and
asset-backed issues, no new offerings were priced Tuesday.
