   HONG KONG -- Playmates International Holdings Ltd.
announced a 69-fold surge in first-half profit, as the
luminous performance of its "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
line drove earnings far above even the most sanguine
expectations.
   The Hong Kong toy group said final profit skyrocketed to
350 million Hong Kong dollars (US$45 million) in the first
half from HK$5 million a year earlier. Earnings per share
soared to HK$2 (25 U.S. cents) from 3 Hong Kong cents, while
turnover climbed to HK$1.38 billion from HK$254 million.

   "No one thought their results could look like this," said
an analyst of industrial issues at an international brokerage
firm. The results were about 50% higher than most full-year
profit expectations of HK$200 million to HK$250 million.
   The group's directors proposed an interim dividend of 10
Hong Kong cents a share; no payout was made in the 1989 first
half. They also recommended a 3-for-1 bonus issue to help
improve the shares' liquidity.
