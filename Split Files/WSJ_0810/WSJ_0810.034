   NEW YORK -- The stock market continued its rebound as
encouraging words on the Middle East situation and a rise in
bond prices inspired further bargain-hunting.
   But the pace of trading, which had been brisk ever since
Iraq invaded Kuwait one week ago, slowed substantially as
many participants retreated to the sidelines to await further
details on the conflict.

   "Events now have reached the point where it's a
wait-and-see attitude in terms of the Middle East," said
Larry Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 24.26
Wednesday, rose 24.01 to 2758.91. New York Stock Exchange
trading was the lightest since July 30 as 155,810,000 shares
changed hands.
   Broader measures also posted solid gains, but didn't keep
pace with the Dow Jones industrials. For example, Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.59 to 339.94 -- a 0.47% rise,
compared with a gain of 0.88% in the industrial average.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.84
to 186.24 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 1.75
to 315.31. Advancing issues topped decliners on the Big Board
by 837 to 695.
   After drifting in narrow ranges through the first half of
the session, prices turned higher as the market responded to
a Pentagon statement that the Iraqi forces in Kuwait "seem to
be in a defensive posture."
   Stocks rallied to session highs in late trading after the
completion of the Treasury's auction of $10.26 billion in
30-year bonds, the third and final leg of its quarterly
refunding, which drew a better-than-expected response from
investors.
   Treasury notes and bonds moved higher in response to the
auction results, which arrived on the heels of Wednesday's
disappointing sale of 10-year notes. In late trading,
long-term Treasury issues were up 3/4 point, or $7.50 per
$1,000 face amount.
   Stock buyers continued to concentrate on issues of
companies expected to deliver solid earnings growth.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 7/8 to 80 7/8; the company posted a
14% increase in earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in June
after factoring out a restructuring charge, taken in the
year-ago period.
   Boeing, a favorite among growth stocks, gained 1 1/2 to 54
1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.8 million shares.
   Philip Morris rose 7/8 to 46 1/2 on 1.5 million shares,
Coca-Cola climbed 3/4 to 44 3/4, Merck gained 7/8 to 86 and
ConAgra rose 1 to 33 3/4.
   Wal-Mart Stores added 3/8 to 30 5/8 and topped the list of
most active issues on the Big Board, as about 2.8 million
shares changed hands. The retailer reported increases of
24.6% in fiscal second-quarter net income and 8% in July
sales at stores open at least one year.
   Retailers reported that apparel sales were strong last
month, and the news spurred buying in issues such as Limited
Inc., which advanced 1 1/4 to 19 5/8 on 1.5 million shares,
and Gap Inc., which rose 2 to 55 3/4. Limited's sales for
stores open at least one year rose 6%; at Gap, the increase
was 28%.
   Other retailing issues were mixed; Sears Roebuck rose 7/8
to 30 1/2, K mart eased 3/8 to 30 3/8, J.C. Penney dropped
7/8 to 52 1/4, May Department Stores rose 2 3/4 to 46 3/4 and
Woolworth added 1/4 to 29 1/8.
   Continental Airlines Holdings, which confirmed that Frank
Lorenzo is stepping down as chairman and chief executive
officer and selling most of his stake to Scandinavian
Airlines System, rose 1 3/4 to 6 1/4 in heavy trading on the
American Stock Exchange. Composite trading amounted to 2.3
million shares.
   Delta Air Lines rose 3/4 to 60 3/8 after disclosing plans
to raise fares 10%, starting next Wednesday, to offset higher
jet fuel costs. AMR, which owns American Airlines, rose 3/4
to 52 and USAir Group rose 3/4 to 20 1/2.
   But UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 3/4 to 113
3/4 following news of its plans to increase fares 5.3% on all
domestic flights as of next Wednesday. The stock traded as
high as 123 in the wake of its board's 60-day extension of a
deadline for a union-led group to arrange financing for its
$4.38 billion buy-out offer.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 1 1/2 to 37 and traded as low as 36
1/8, a 52-week low. Analysts attributed the stock's drop to
worries that the company's results for its fiscal third
quarter, to be reported Thursday, might be weaker than
expected, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.
   Earlier this week, Kidder Peabody analyst David R. Korus
lowered his earnings estimates on Hewlett-Packard for fiscal
1990 and 1991, citing expectations that several of the
company's core businesses will remain sluggish. Mr. Korus
also lowered his third-quarter projection from 75 cents a
share to a range of 65 cents to 70 cents a share, according
to the investor report.
   Chemical Waste Management added 1 1/8 to 22 1/4. The
company disclosed that a federal appeals court overturned an
Alabama law which has blocked it from importing waste into
the state from several other states for disposal. Waste
Management, which owns a 78% stake in the company, gained 3/4
to 39 7/8.
   Kay Jewelers rose 1 7/8 to 12 7/8 before trading was
halted late in the session. After the close, Britain's
Ratners Group said it would raise its offer for two issues of
Kay junk bonds to 90% of their principal amount from 75% -- a
move that could clear the way for Ratners to complete its
$17-a-share takeover offer.
   Sara Lee, whose earnings for the June quarter rose 13% and
were in line with expectations, climbed 1 1/8 to 27 3/4.
   Bell Industries added 1 to 15 3/8. The company reported
that earnings for the June quarter nearly doubled from a year
earlier.
   Chili's gained 1 to 32 3/8. Lehman Brothers upgraded its
short-term investment rating on the issue and added it to a
list of recommended growth stocks.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.46
to 341.49. Volume totaled 13,540,000 shares.
