   Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln had their
faces etched in stone. Dan Quayle will soon have his puss on
a pumpkin.
   Assuming, of course, that Richard Tweddell's garden grows.
Mr. Tweddell's Cincinnati company, Vegiforms Inc., makes
plastic vanity molds that shape blossoming vegetables into
various shapes, even a vice president's head.

   "Dan's coming along beautifully," says Mr. Tweddell,
noting that the VP pumpkin should be ready for Halloween.
"I'm so proud." Mr. Tweddell has already grown vegetables
resembling Elvis, Clark Gable and Pat Sajak. "We do a
beautiful Ron Reagan," he adds.
   This guy may sound like a fruitcake, but he gets $2,500
for each vanity mold sold. For the more budget-conscious,
there's a line of $10.95 molds that create hearts, diamonds,
elves and a set of happy and sad faces for squash or
cucumbers.
   Mr. Tweddell, a toy designer, says his favorite is the
mold that can disguise yellow squash as an ear of corn. "It's
great fun at a barbecue," he notes.
   He prefers using eggplants for women's faces because "the
skin is so beautiful." His replicas of actresses Linda Evans
and Vivian Leigh "had a sheen to them, like a hood ornament."
That is until they start to rot. Then, he says, "they get
crow's-feet and their mouths pucker."
   Culinary experts scoff at the idea of adding corny
vegetables to the menu. La Maisonette, where well-heeled
Cincinnatians dine, isn't likely to try them. "We're not that
adventurous here," sniffs George Haidon, veteran chef. He
prefers working with fresh fish, which, he says, "aren't
cooperative enough" to become artwork.
   Some goofy gourds end up as common side dishes. Mr.
Tweddell carefully harvested a horde of David Letterman
eggplants and squash, but producers of the late-night TV talk
show voted against putting them on the program. "They said
they weren't grotesque enough," he says.
   But a Greek restaurant didn't mind. It bought several
pounds of the Letterman veggies and chopped them up for
moussaka, which it describes as a "very greasy" casserole.
   Meanwhile, Liz Murphy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Quayle,
figures it's all right for the vice president to be a
vegetable, as long as others in the cornucopia are credible
and, preferably, Republican. "He wouldn't mind being a
pumpkin head if he's in good company," she says.
