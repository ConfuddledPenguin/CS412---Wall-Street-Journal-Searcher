   WASHINGTON -- Lamar Kelly pauses to consider why trying to
sell billions of dollars in real estate held by dead savings
and loans will be a challenge. He clears his throat.
   "A lot of these investment opportunities," he says evenly,
"have some...impaired traits."

   With that little bit of understatement, he and his
overworked assistant burst into laughter.
   As the official in charge of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s
mountain of foreclosed properties, Mr. Kelly can be forgiven
a moment of gallows humor. His government agency faces an
impossibly daunting task: It's handling the biggest
real-estate sale of the century, and it's happening at the
worst possible time. Real-estate financing has dried up.
Interest rates show no sign of falling soon. Most of the
country is either charging headlong into a real-estate slump
or clawing its way back from one.
   "Frankly, right now, the principal factors are moving
against us," says William Seidman, the soon-to-exit chieftain
of the government's savings and loan rescue.
   Nevertheless, the one-year-old RTC is trying to persuade
pension funds, insurance companies, private investors,
foreigners and bottom fishers to buy its repossessed real
estate, more than 35,000 properties worth about $14 billion
now. The amount of unloaded property is expected to reach
$100 billion by the time it's all over. If it ever is.
   Mr. Kelly, who gets his drawl from his Alabama boyhood,
can point to few Southern mansions on his books. It's easier
to point to properties with those "impaired traits." These
include a Quality Inn in Phoenix whose absurdly high
operating costs would, in two years' time, make it cheaper to
give away than to continue operating. Then there's the marina
in Louisiana that is only a marina at high tide.
   There is Estrella, the infamous 8,890-acre city in the
Arizona desert, meticulously planned but never built by
Charles Keating, former head of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association. And there is a New Jersey housing
development with not one but two entirely different types of
toxic waste.
   Who will see ivory in this herd of white elephants? The
RTC wonders, too. "There's no new Donald Trump out there
getting geared up for the '90s," sighs Mr. Kelly, director of
the agency's asset and real-estate management division.
   Most of the property is too dicey for blue-chip investors
seeking only institutional-quality real estate. Most pension
funds, for example, have glanced at the holdings and don't
plan to look further. Roger Franz of the State of California
Public Retirement System Fund, which has $5 billion in
real-estate holdings, sums it up succinctly: "We haven't
bought anything from the RTC, nor do we anticipate acquiring
RTC property."
   Here's how tough sales are. At a June congressional
hearing, the question of fraudulent sales arose. An irate
congressman asked Mr. Kelly whether it wasn't possible for
borrowers from an S&amp;L to default on a real-estate loans, let
the RTC take over their properties and then come back to buy
them from the RTC for 10 cents on the dollar. "If they were
offering a cash deal, I'm not sure we should turn them away,"
Mr. Kelly said matter-of-factly. No one on the stunned
committee dared argue.
   Even if a buyer has the inclination, bankers aren't in the
mood to make real-estate loans. Borrowers across the country
are streaming into Washington to complain that their
once-friendly bankers have deserted them. "Until the RTC
provides a track record {of completing real-estate sales and
providing some financing itself}, the normal financing
channels won't perform and come to the table," says Norm
Flynn, head of the National Association of Realtors. "Every
piece of property they have is tainted, because they are the
seller."
   Much of the $2 billion of RTC real estate sold by the end
of June went to foreign investors, who were skimming off the
cream, thanks in part to a greater availability of financing
outside the U.S. Canadian investors, also taking advantage of
tax benefits, are particularly on the hunt. Aaron Mills, a
Toronto investor, recently bought a large apartment complex
in Dallas. And a 140-room hotel in Pompano Beach, Fla., was
snatched up by Raymond Malenfant, a Quebec hotel developer.
   Japanese investors have been busy, too. Yukio Kitano, an
investor from Osaka, purchased Stonebridge Ranch, a
6,000-acre development with three golf courses in Dallas.
   But the RTC's sheer size, and the fact that it's a
brand-new bureaucracy, hampers its sales efforts. To meet a
congressional deadline, for example, it rushed to compile its
catalog of real estate, and it is rife with errata. In Texas,
its list of property requiring appraisals is backed up 60
days. "The size of the problem is a problem all by itself,"
says John Aldrich, an Atlanta real-estate consultant.
   Watching the RTC price its inventory has been a virtual
how-not-to-market lesson. Originally, the agency relied
solely on appraisals and wouldn't sell at anything below 95%
of appraised value in depressed areas. Offers barely trickled
in, but plenty of meaningless appraisals were conducted. The
agency abandoned that plan. Now, if a property doesn't sell
in six months, the RTC may mark down the price 15%.
"Aggressive pricing," says Mr. Kelly.
   But that reversal, some say, did nothing but set back the
RTC clock six months. "It's like playing a $50 billion poker
hand and showing the buyer your hand," says Larry Herman, a
Dallas real-estate agent who has sold several RTC properties.
"It's insanity. Who is going to buy now if they know the
price will drop in six months?"
   Government financing is just as sticky. Adopting a stern
posture toward the kind of real-estate speculation that
helped fuel the S&amp;L crisis, the RTC at first refused to
provide any financing. Later, it relented and agreed to
finance some sales provided there was a 25% down payment.
Finally, it quietly dropped that to 15%, but the loan must be
of sufficient quality for sale into the secondary market. Of
the $2 billion in sales so far, less than $100 million have
used government financing.
   It will take plenty of creative government to grease the
skids, real-estate pros say. The RTC has begun tinkering with
much bigger and more aggressive financing schemes, but they
haven't been through the rigorous review process yet. It is
considering, for example, pooling discounted notes on
properties where it provides financing. It is also looking at
ways of selling portions of loan pools that don't meet the
requirements for secondary-market sale.
   As the enormity of the problem sinks in, the RTC must
slash prices more aggressively even as it devises still more
creative financing schemes. The trick is doing it in such a
way that it steps up sales without also increasing the heat
from a scandal-sensitive Congress and White House. "You have
to try every trick that's conceivable to man to move it,"
says Mr. Kelly, "and do it one bite at a time."
   Ultimately, the RTC will rely more on the private sector
for its heavy lifting. As more property moves through the RTC
receiverships, it is put in the hands of asset managers, who
maintain the property and market it aggressively -- cooking
up the transformation of a shopping center, say, into a
school. It is also relying on such tried-and-true marketers
as the Multiple Listing Service. "Lots of people are looking
at our property and don't even know they are looking at our
property," says an RTC spokesman.
   The RTC, however, does have one small advantage working
for it: It has plenty of property from which to carry on its
own business. It is opening sales centers across the country
where customers can browse through property lists, loan
portfolios and everything else it's purveying. The sales
offices are in repossessed property it holds. Its office in
Costa Mesa, Calif., was the opulent Pacific Savings Plaza,
seized this year. Its Phoenix sales office was the
headquarters of Sun State Savings &amp; Loan. In Baton Rouge, the
RTC office camped in a glassed-in section in the middle of a
repossessed shopping center.
   "We're no different from anyone else selling real estate
right now," says Mr. Kelly. "You have to get out there and
market."
