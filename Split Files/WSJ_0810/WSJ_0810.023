   BONN -- Facing insurmountable political opposition, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl scrapped plans to make Oct. 14
the date for formal unification and all-German elections.
   The West German leader set off a political firestorm last
week when he backed a call from his East German counterpart,
Lothar de Maiziere, to accelerate the already hectic schedule
for the full political unity of the two countries. Parties in
the two Germanys already had agreed to hold the vote on Dec.
2, and Bonn now says it will stick with that date.

   Thursday's decision came in the wake of a stormy session
of the Bundestag, West Germany's parliament, in which the
opposition Social Democrats adamantly refused to approve a
change in West Germany's Basic Law needed to clear the way
for the earlier vote. Mr. Kohl needed a two-thirds majority,
and therefore the Social Democrats' support, to succeed.
   The dispute illustrates the way politics in the two
Germanys has become hopelessly intertwined. Sister parties in
East and West are working together to give themselves the
best possible chances in the forthcoming elections. For the
Social Democrats, this means putting off the election to
allow time for East Germany's deteriorating economy to stir a
political backlash against Mr. Kohl.
   For the same reason, Mr. Kohl and his allies are eager to
get the election over with quickly. The longer East Germany
remains separate, they argue, the longer the uncertainties
remain that have caused Western companies to hold back on
investing in the East's shattered economy.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democrats, the junior
partner in Mr. Kohl's ruling coalition, told lawmakers
yesterday that holding elections in October rather than
December would "improve the pyschological situation {in East
Germany} and thereby create better frameworks for the
economy."
   The dispute erupted as the costs of the German merger are
ballooning. Yesterday, a top official in Bonn's Finance
Ministry said the country was working on a new supplemental
budget to cover the spiraling costs of German unity. And on
Wednesday, Mr. Kohl urged the West German banking community
to pump more money into the East and shoulder more of the
risks.
   "The economic and social situation in East Germany has
worsened faster than we expected," said Matthias Wissmann, a
member of parliament who belongs to Mr. Kohl's Christian
Democrats. But he emphasized that the government had expected
a difficult transition.
   If the situation in East Germany continues to worsen, the
country could simply throw itself into the arms of West
Germany. Under West German Basic Law, East Germany could
proclaim itself part of West Germany -- and the West would
have to accept the decision.
   But again, cross-border politics are likely to decide how
this is played out. The Social Democrats in both Germanys
favor merging the two countries under the Basic Law soon,
possibly in September. This could give the Social Democrats a
powerful political edge, as it might make it even easier for
them to blame the Christian Democrats for the country's woes.
   Not surprisingly, the Christian Democrats argue that
formal merger and all-German elections are "two sides of the
same coin" that must take place simultaneously. Otherwise,
they argue, the East Germans could find themselves without a
democratically elected government.
   It isn't clear if Mr. Kohl would still insist on linking
the two. In the past, the Bonn government has said unity
couldn't occur before Sept. 12, when the two Germanys and the
four victorious powers from World War II -- the U.S., France,
Britain, and the Soviet Union -- meet in Moscow for the last
round of the so-called two-plus-four negotiations.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Kohl's decision to back down on the
election date could clear the way for a backlog of badly
needed legislation in both countries. During this week's
face-off over an election date, the East German parliament --
apparently by accident -- failed to muster the votes
necessary to pass the election treaty that sets the ground
rules for the coming vote. Both German parliaments are now
expected to pass the treaty later this month.
   The two countries are also still hammering away at a
second state treaty covering issues the two sides weren't
able to wrap up in time for the treaty on economic and
monetary union, which took effect July 1.
