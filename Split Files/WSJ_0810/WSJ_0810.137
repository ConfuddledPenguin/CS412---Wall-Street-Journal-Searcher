   HOLLYWOOD -- Forgive Walt Disney shareholders if they feel
as if they're trapped at a never-ending screening of
"Iraqnophobia." The Mideast oil trauma has been buffeting
Disney's stock, and not because film is a petroleum-based
product, either. Disney shares rise and fall not on
moviemaking, but on theme parks, where the company raked in
64% of its pre-tax operating profit last year.
   The attendance-shrinking potential of higher gasoline
prices has escalated a decline in the stock that was touched
off last month by fears of a weakening economy. So hard has
this once-loved stock fallen that now, even as several
analysts lower their near-term earnings estimates, a fellow
at Goldman Sachs is renewing a "buy" recommendation, citing
Disney's long-term strengths.

   Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Disney shares plunged
12% to 102 3/8 Monday. They have recovered a bit since and
yesterday closed at 109 3/4, up 1 3/4, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   The shares began eroding from their mid-130s peak even
before analysts began to worry that higher prices at the
gasoline pump and the airline ticket counter would hurt
attendance at Disney's Florida and Southern California parks.
Disney hasn't released theme-park attendance figures since
new management took over in 1984, raising ticket prices
aggressively and making the stock a Wall Street favorite.
   The company says it guards the numbers "because Wall
Street overreacts in the short term." But Disney executives
have conceded to analysts that attendance at the parks has
been flat this summer, even before gasoline-price boosts.
   "Two factors generate theme-park attendance: a strong
economy and new attractions," says First Boston's Jessica
Reif, who Monday downgraded her longstanding "buy"
recommendation to a hold. "The economy is weak, and Disney
has no new major attractions planned domestically for several
years."
   Ms. Reif adds that during the 1973-74 oil embargo, Disney
World attendance dropped 6% and Disneyland was off 4.5%; in
1979, attendance again fell in response to rising oil prices
and stayed weak through 1982.
   "But that was a different Disney," counters analyst
Raymond Katz of Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Walt Disney World
was brand new and it wasn't a `destination' resort. . . .
There were no consumer products or filmed entertainment to
speak of" at the company.
   Disney still has a hot hand in movies. "Pretty Woman" is
the year's biggest hit, and for the third year in a row
Disney will rank near the top among studios in terms of
market share. "Dick Tracy" may not have been as big as Disney
had hoped, but it still grossed $100 million. "Three Men and
a Little Lady" and a re-released "Fantasia" come out this
fall.
   These hits will pay off even more for Disney when they
reach the company's video executives, who dominate the
growing "sell-through" business -- pricing cassettes
sufficiently low that consumers will buy them rather than
rent them. Disney's merchandise-packed stores continue to
grow and its prototype restaurant, Mickey's Kitchen, is off
to good start and appears likely to be expanded.
   Disney stock also tumbled late last year, and Goldman's
Richard Simon at the time slapped a "hold" sticker over his
buy rating maintained since 1985. The shares dropped 23%
between November and early February, then revived to hit an
intraday high of 136 1/2 last month, or 22 times earnings.
The stock now is at less than 19 times trailing earnings.
   Because of the stock dip, Goldman's Mr. Simon reinstituted
his buy recommendation Tuesday, even as he lowered his
earnings estimate. "The current price has more than adjusted
for the risks in light of a very favorable long-term
environment," he says.
   The shares fell briefly Wednesday after newswires reported
that Morgan Stanley's Alan Kassan believed Disney had put
long-term stock buy-back plans on hold and was contemplating
a major acquisition, such as either CBS or MCA. Disney
declined to comment, but analysts said the company has been
casting cold water on the talk. Neither rumored target is
new. Disney is indeed thought to be interested in buying a TV
network, particularly if the government's financial-interest
rules wither away this year. But the company is a bottom
fisher and some think CBS might be too pricey. With MCA,
analysts warn of antitrust problems. Besides, the companies
don't like each other.
   "There's a better chance of George Bush and Saddam Hussein
going out for a beer," says Shearson's Mr. Katz, "than for
Michael Eisner and {MCA President} Sid Sheinberg to sit down
in a room together."
