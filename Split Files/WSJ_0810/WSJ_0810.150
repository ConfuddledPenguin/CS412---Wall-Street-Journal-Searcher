   Saddam Hussein is ready to kill and invade wherever he
judges that it is in his interest to do so. Anyone in the
least doubt about his ruthlessness has only to remember how
he gassed the Kurds in his own country. If he could realize
his threats to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf, to
Jordan and to "burn Israel," then he would do so without
hesitating.
   To Westerners, this makes him out to be a little Hitler,
defying his neighbors and even the world community in a way
that appears irrational, if not mad. An effort of imagination
and some knowledge of history are required to understand that
he is not in the least deranged but behaving in accordance
with ancient customs in the Middle East. Arabs do things
differently from us, and always have.

   In the customary Arab order, power belongs to whoever has
the will and capacity to capture and hold it. Such a man then
becomes honored, all the more if he has displayed brutal
skills that others could not match. This acquired honor
legitimizes and justifies his leadership. Even Arabs who have
reason to fear Saddam cannot help admiring him.
   Throughout the Arab Middle East there is no check of any
kind on absolute power: no government by consent, no
representative parliament or loyal opposition, no free
speech. Treaties, frontiers, sovereignty are Western concepts
easily brushed aside in the absence of institutions to
realize them. What might look like Arab nation-states are
therefore much closer to tribes held together by
military-type rulers according to custom and sanctioned by
honor. Everywhere the strong feel it only normal to oppress
the weak. That is why the Middle East is so violent and
backward.
   Imperial Britain and France once might have broken this
customary order but, perhaps to their credit, considered at
the time that the human cost would be too high. Instead, they
withdrew from the Middle East on terms that encouraged those
Arabs with the ambition for it to seize and exploit power as
they have been doing since time immemorial. The rise of Gamal
Abdel Nasser and the Suez crisis in 1956, the expropriation
of Western oil companies, the conduct of Moammar Gadhafi and
the sale of armaments on the most massive scale were so many
proofs in Arab eyes that the West no longer had the will or
the power to defend itself, and that its political and social
systems were not worthy of respect.
   Attacking Iran in 1980, Saddam launched a classic tribal
war, with its religious and ethnic undertones. Instead of
being obliged to suffer the consequences to the full, he was
rescued by the West and the Soviet Union, resupplied
militarily and backed diplomatically. What other conclusion
could he draw except that he had bent these countries to his
will? It seems certain to him that he had become the decisive
power-holder in the region, and that whoever did not show him
due honor and deference could be destroyed with impunity.
Undisputed leader of the Arabs, he sees himself a conquering
hero, the new Saladin, to be admired for all times. In that
spirit, Iraqis flashed the headlights of their cars and blew
their horns at the news of the capture of Kuwait.
   Also in that spirit, Saddam warned that Kuwait will become
a graveyard if the West intervenes. The former regime cannot
be restored because "the sun of honor" has now shone in
Kuwait. Iraqi radio reports pure tribal boasting: "We would
rather die than be humiliated, and we will pluck out the eyes
of those who attack the Arab nation." Saddam himself said
Wednesday that "death is preferable to humiliation."
   In the tribal order, peaceful negotiations may apply to
low-grade disputes, but genuine conflicts of interest have to
be resolved by force. No tribal leader dares risk the shame
that follows from making concessions. Saddam is now in this
predicament. He cannot admit that the invasion of Kuwait was
a gross miscalculation and still retain his honor. To
evacuate is to be humiliated. Should he fail, he knows well
that the Iraqis will not just cease to blow car horns but
will round on him and kill him.
   The logic of his situation suggests that instead he might
attempt to win the sort of honor that other Arabs would find
overwhelming, for instance by invading Saudi Arabia -- or
other Gulf states. A sure-fire way to unite the Arabs behind
him would be the approved tribal strike against Israel. In
the event of inflicting serious damage on Israel, he could
expect Arabs everywhere to grant him prizes like Kuwait. For
the time being, the only reasonable conclusion is that he
will do nothing that might bring shame upon himself. The rest
of the world has no option but to engage him on these terms.
   The purpose of American and other forces reaching the Gulf
is to secure a vital interest. A military expedition has set
off, the Security Council has voted for an embargo. Should
these measures fail, should Saddam be left in possession of
these spoils, the consequences will be suffered for many
years to come. For it will appear to Arabs that Saddam has
got the better of everyone, and really is the conqueror he
claims to be. Western and democratic values will be written
off even by those Arabs who aspire to them.
   Should fighting break out, the determination must be
inflexible to use whatever degree of force is necessary for
successful arbitration. Already Saddam's strategy is to
weaken Western resolution by means of various deceptions, for
instance holding Americans and Europeans who happen to be in
Iraq or Kuwait, implying that they are hostages. One of his
puppets in Kuwait stated that Western countries "should not
expect us to behave honorably" toward these people. Saddam of
course is sure that Iraqis in the West would not be similarly
hijacked.
   At this point in history there is no question of conquest
or imperialism. This is a clash of quite a different kind,
between past and present, between tribal custom and
government by consent. Before Arabs can take their place in
the modern world as they deserve, rulers of the stamp of
Saddam have to be exposed as the savage and outmoded tyrants
that they are.
