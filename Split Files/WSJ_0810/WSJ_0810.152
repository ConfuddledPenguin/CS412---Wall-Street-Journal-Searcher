   WASHINGTON -- The confrontation in the Middle East could
cost the Pentagon $3 billion or more in unexpected costs for
fuel, spare parts and hazardous pay for troops if it
continues for several months, according to military budget
experts.
   The $3 billion estimate doesn't factor in possible damage
to U.S. ships and planes or the cost of ammunition and
missiles if actual fighting occurs.

   The largest part of the anticipated extra costs, according
to Pentagon officials and congressional aides, involves
higher fuel prices the military must pay world-wide as a
result of increases in the price of crude oil. The jump in
crude-oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is likely to
mean nearly $2 billion in higher overall fuel costs for the
U.S. armed forces by early next year, according to some
internal Pentagon estimates.
   Unless world oil prices plummet -- which few people expect
-- those extra costs will strain Pentagon budget accounts
regardless of how long U.S. troops remain in Saudi Arabia.
   In addition, it's likely to cost hundreds of millions of
dollars to move large numbers of troops, planes and spare
parts to the Middle East, and then keep them there for an
extended period.
   The total price tag, of course, depends on the military
situation on the ground. But according to budget analysts,
the massive airlift and deployment of U.S. naval power in the
region entails huge extra fuel costs. Stepped-up air and sea
operations are bound to mean increased maintenance and
logistics costs.
   Neither the military nor congressional committees have
developed detailed cost estimates, and senior Pentagon
officials have declined to comment on the matter. But
officials note that the U.S. invasion of Panama earlier this
year -- a much simpler and smaller operation that lasted only
a few weeks -- cost the Defense Department nearly $400
million in extra operating and personnel costs.
   In the short term, each of the armed forces will try to
cope with the problem by cutting back on routine maintenance,
purchases and other nonessential operating expenses. But if
the military confrontation continues for several months, the
Pentagon either will have to ask Congress to approve a
supplemental appropriations measure or give it greater
authority to transfer funds among certain accounts.
   As part of that strategy, the White House announced
yesterday that President Bush plans to partly exempt spending
on military personnel from any automatic spending cuts that
might occur this fall.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush plans
to shield only as much Pentagon spending as needed to
maintain U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. He said Mr. Bush and
his budget advisers, who conferred Wednesday night, still
aren't sure what the deployment will cost.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, Mr. Bush
must decide by Wednesday whether to exempt some or all
Pentagon spending on uniformed personnel from the automatic
spending cuts that will be triggered in October -- unless
Congress finds a way to reduce the deficit by $74 billion or
alters the Gramm-Rudman statute.
   Although the administration is preparing to impose about
$84 billion in Gramm-Rudman spending cuts, many in Congress
doubt cuts of that size will be allowed to go into effect
because they would be so disruptive to the government and
economy.
   If Pentagon personnel spending is protected, other
military spending would be cut more deeply under the law.
Should personnel be exempted entirely, Pentagon spending
would be cut by 34.9%, the White House budget office
estimated. Non-defense spending covered by the law would be
cut by 31.9%.
