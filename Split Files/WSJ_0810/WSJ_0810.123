   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. effort to isolate Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein gained ground, but fears mounted for Americans
and other foreigners in Iraq.
   Iraq's military threat to Saudi Arabia remained worrisome
but showed signs of stabilizing, and the Bush administration
gave its strongest signal yet that it's prepared to use a
naval blockade to stop Iraqi exports. And speculation grew
that an Arab meeting postponed until today in Cairo could
consider a negotiated solution under which Iraq would
withdraw from Kuwait in return for huge financial and other
concessions from the Kuwaitis.

   Iraq was set back when the two Arab nations that have
appeared sympathetic to the invasion of Kuwait appeared to
abandon it. Yemen voted in the United Nations Security
Council to approve unanimously a resolution rejecting Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait. And Jordanian officials indicated to
diplomats they will abide by a U.N. trade embargo of Iraq --
potentially helping to cut off food imports.
   U.S. satisfaction with these diplomatic advances was
tempered by the inability of most foreigners to leave Iraq or
Kuwait. The official Iraqi position is unclear, but the
nation appears to be refusing to let non-diplomatic
foreigners leave, and 38 Americans remain in a Baghdad hotel.
   The Bush administration doesn't consider the Americans to
be hostages and is gratified that they seem to be receiving
the same treatment as other foreigners. But these and other
Americans could become pawns in a prolonged U.S.-Iraqi
standoff. Another group of Americans, including some
government officials, were turned back when they tried to
drive across the Iraqi-Jordanian border, and some 3,000
Americans are in Kuwait.
   Iraq continued to fortify its positions on the
Kuwait-Saudi border, but U.S. and diplomatic officials said
they saw no significant preparations for an invasion. A
senior Bush administration aide estimated that Iraq, with an
estimated 120,000 soldiers in Kuwait, could invade with less
than a day's preparation. Saddam Hussein moved some forces
from central Iraq south toward Kuwait. But officials
interpret the movements as efforts by Iraq to consolidate
positions it holds.
   While the U.S. isn't leading an international naval
blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports, officials said U.S.,
British and French ships are stationed near ports through
which Iraq exports oil and are prepared to stop shipments
should customers resume purchases of Iraqi crude. Reuters
news service said Australia is going to send two guided
missile frigates to the Persian Gulf. "I would anticipate
that we would take some steps to interfere with the export of
petroleum products," a senior administration official told
reporters.
   An Iraqi-chartered tanker waiting to be filled with Iraq's
oil outside the Saudi Arabian Red Sea port of Yanbu continued
to wait, according to oil industry sources. So far, Saudi
authorities have not given it permission to enter the port,
which is the terminus of an export pipeline for Iraqi oil.
   One significant snag continued to impair the U.S. effort
to keep Iraq out of Saudi Arabia while inflicting enough
economic pain to push the nation out of Kuwait. Other Arab
nations haven't agreed to send troops to Saudi Arabia to join
U.S. and British forces. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia want Arab
military support to avoid making the Saudis appear as
instruments of Western will.
   The Arab meeting in Cairo -- called partly to create an
Arab military force to send to Saudi Arabia -- was postponed
when one of Saddam Hussein's top deputies and the exiled emir
of Kuwait, to great surprise, both arrived to attend.
   That led to a series of backroom discussions among Arab
leaders, and some analysts speculated that they might have
been exploring a deal in which Iraq would receive a disputed
oil field, a strategic Kuwaiti island and a big cash payment
from Kuwait's royal family in return for withdrawing. But
Bush administration officials and senior Arab diplomats in
Washington said they hadn't heard of any such deal and
discounted the rumors. One official acknowledged, though,
that the U.S. has worried that some Arabs might be more
tempted to buy off Saddam Hussein rather than push him out of
Kuwait.
   The force in Saudi Arabia could grow through the addition
of more Western troops. France, which has warships in the
Persian Gulf, indicated it would be "sympathetic" to a
request for ground forces, a senior U.S. official said.
   U.S. officials said about 3,000 non-Saudi Arab soldiers
are in Saudi Arabia, including a contingent from nations in
the Gulf Cooperation Council, a gulf defense alliance that
were on routine assignment. Those soldiers will be considered
part of a multinational force.
   After meeting with Turkey's leaders, Secretary of State
James Baker left Ankara optimistic that Turkey would lend
military support. Although plans were still being developed,
the moves could include lifting restrictions on U.S. rights
at NATO air bases in Turkey so they could be used to stage
missions over Saudi Arabia or Iraq.
   "In the event that there were to be full-scale
hostilities, I'm quite confident that we could count on our
allies, the Turks," an administration official told reporters
traveling with the secretary of state.
   To induce the Turks to help militarily -- and to reward
them for their earlier step of shutting down Iraqi pipeline
shipments through Turkey -- Mr. Baker carried a pledge from
the wealthy former rulers of Kuwait to reimburse Turkey for
oil-related losses of as much as $2 billion. Mr. Baker also
pledged U.S. support for loans and loan guarantees from the
World Bank and similar institutions and from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.
   An Iraqi-U.S. clash remained possible, with Iraq facing a
burgeoning U.S. force in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the
region. About 6,000 U.S. troops are on the ground in Saudi
Arabia, and the numbers are growing rapidly. The U.S. has
told Saudi Arabia it intends to ship in a "minimum deterrent
force" of more than 40,000 troops by the end of the month,
according to Pentagon officials. Only a portion of the troops
will be based in Saudia Arabia, with the rest likely to be in
Turkey and perhaps other Arab nations.
   In the event of an Iraqi invasion, Pentagon plans call for
putting in 100,000 or 150,000 troops, the officials said. And
that intention, according to one senior military official,
"has been conveyed unambiguously through diplomatic channels"
to U.S. allies.
   According to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. actions
have caused Iraq to move to protect its tanks, aircraft and
troops from possible attack. Based on satellite pictures and
Iraqi military communications monitored by the U.S., Iraqi
troops appear to be preparing for a long standoff, military
officials said.
   Only a trickle of reinforcements have moved from Iraq and
Kuwait toward the Saudi border, officials said. The number of
Iraqi tanks and troops in that area hasn't changed.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that the
Iraqis "seem to be in a defensive posture." Instead of
preparing for an attack, he said, Iraqi generals seem
"determined to hold on to what they have acquired." He added:
"We don't see any movement of {Iraqi} military forces in
reaction" to U.S. actions.
   Bush administration aides declined to say whether the U.S.
will call for a naval blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports,
insisting that international arrangements for enforcing the
U.N. trade sanctions are being negotiated with other nations.
   But officials suggested the U.S. has decided against
declaring a blockade. Nevertheless, the U.S. and allies have
assembled the naval forces needed to stop Iraqi oil shipments
through the Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf. The
U.S. hopes exports will be stopped voluntarily -- but is
signaling that it is prepared to institute a blockade if
necessary.
   Meanwhile, the chances for expanded U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia seemed to be growing. U.S. officials said the
administration had decided to revive a stalled sale of 20
F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia. The sale was held up by
opposition in Congress, but the officials indicated it would
go forward.
   At the same time, Congress began reconsidering its effort
to prohibit arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Air Force
lacks much capability to destroy tanks, and the pilots are
still training to use British-built Tornado attack jets that
the Saudis bought because they could not buy the equivalent
U.S. F-15E.
   Congress has also rejected a sale of advanced infra-red
guided Maverick missiles, the U.S. Air Force's preferred
antitank weapon. Saudi F-5 pilots use an older version of the
Maverick that is guided by television cameras that can't see
through haze or dust and that can't distinguish a camouflaged
tank against the desert floor.
   Congress has also limited the number of older model F-15
fighters the Saudis could have in Saudi Arabia. The limit was
set at 60 in 1987. To reinforce the Saudis, President Bush
declared a national security crisis to waive the restriction.
   Officials in the State and Defense departments said they
were ready to review prior Saudi requests for arms.
