   PITTSBURGH -- H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly signed a five-year contract that gives the chief
executive officer options to buy four million shares of the
profitable food giant.
   There's a hitch: Mr. O'Reilly can't exercise the options
until 1995. He's banking that Heinz will repeat its
performance of the past five years, in which the return to
shareholders -- which is share price plus dividend
reinvestment -- has grown at a 25% annual compounded rate. If
that growth rate continues until 1995, Mr. O'Reilly could
cash out with a $251 million gain.

   "It's one of the largest grants you'll ever find, but he
doesn't make a dime unless the stock appreciates," said
Michael Halloran, executive compensation practice leader at
Towers Perrin Forster &amp; Crosby, a New York consulting firm.
The package reflects a compensation trend in which stock
options are used to align the interests of top executives
with those of shareholders.
   The board negotiated Mr. O'Reilly's contract, his first
ever with the company, to reward his success in building
Heinz into a company that consistently posts record earnings.
Heinz officials also feared the executive would be snatched
away by another company, although they know of no specific
offers. The company also worried that Mr. O'Reilly might
leave Heinz to try his hand as a full-time investor.
   "He's a highly visible person and a very rare executive,"
said James McDonald, a Heinz director who heads the board's
compensation committee. The huge option package, Mr. McDonald
said, "is part of the Heinz philosophy to have the highest
percentage of compensation at risk."
   Mr. O'Reilly couldn't be reached to comment.
   His contract is subject to shareholder approval at next
month's annual meeting. The exercise price of the options is
$29.87, which was Heinz's share price March 14, the day the
contract was signed. In composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, Heinz common closed at $33, up 12.5
cents.
   The 54-year-old Mr. O'Reilly already owns, either outright
or through options, 4.3 million Heinz shares, or 1.69% of the
254.2 million shares outstanding. The additional options on
four million shares could increase his stake to more than 3%.
   The new options could add to Mr. O'Reilly's already
considerable fortune. His financial empire in his homeland of
Ireland is valued at $75 million to $100 million. He's the
principal shareholder in Ireland's largest newspaper chain,
Independent Newspapers PLC, and he has interests in an oil
prospecting company, several hotels, retail chains and other
businesses.
   Under the contract, Mr. O'Reilly's cash compensation
remains about the same. Last year, he earned $534,688 in cash
and other compensation and about $1.4 million in bonuses.
   That puts him about average in his peer group, says Louis
Brindisi Jr., senior partner at Strategic Compensation
Associates, a New York consulting firm. "Is his option plan
the norm? No," said Mr. Brindisi. "But is it the right thing
to do from an investor's point of view? The answer is
probably yes."
   But Bob Miller, a principal at the consulting firm of
Wyatt Co. in San Francisco, believes the option grant was
excessive. "If his base salary is low, how many shares do you
need to make that up?" he said. "If the share price goes up
$1 over the next five years, I doubt the shareholders will be
happy with that, but O'Reilly walks away with $4 million."
   Since he became Heinz chairman 11 years ago, Mr. O'Reilly
has built the company into a $6 billion-a-year operation by
introducing Weight Watchers and other new lines and by
aggressively marketing products in the U.S. and abroad. A
former international rugby star known for his droll wit and
hard-driving personality, Mr. O'Reilly has squeezed profits
from ketchup and potatoes with tight cost controls.

   THE SALARY for H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly in the fiscal year ended May 2 was $708,117 in cash
compensation and $2.6 million in bonuses. In Friday's
edition, Mr. O'Reilly's salary was misstated.
