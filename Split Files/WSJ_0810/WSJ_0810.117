   FOR YEARS, it was a mental game that homeowners loved to
play: How much money did I make on my house this year? You
could always count on getting a good feeling from it.
   These days, most people would prefer not to play the game.
For a few homeowners -- particularly in the Midwest -- it's
still tolerable: The increases have been respectable. But for
many others, the year, at best, has been a wash. And for some
owners -- particularly in the Northeast -- the question ought
to be phrased differently: How much money did I lose on my
house this year?

   The statistics on the accompanying map were provided by
Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., travel-costs
consulting firm. The figures represent price changes for
typical four-bedroom homes in upper-middle-class communities.
The first number is the average price for such houses sold
during the first half of this year; this is followed by the
percentage change from the year earlier and the change from
three years earlier. Because the homes are in the cities'
most desirable areas, the increases probably overstate the
general price rises in the cities. In addition, some cities,
particularly on the West Coast, show substantial year-to-year
increases. That's misleading. For one thing, most of the
increases occurred in the second half of last year. In
addition, higher-priced homes in Los Angeles and San
Francisco have only recently begun seeing the price drops
that other homes in the area have felt for the past year.
