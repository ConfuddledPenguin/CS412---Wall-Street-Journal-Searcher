   LONDON -- Investors in Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. approved
one aspect of the ailing company's proposed restructuring,
but once again postponed decisions on three others.
   The partial approval leaves the future of Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond in doubt. Mr. Bond last month said he
would quit as chairman of his flagship company in exchange
for investors' support for actions crucial to Bond Corp.'s
survival. The resignation was to come within 30 days of the
investors' approval.

   It wasn't clear yesterday whether that 30-day clock had
started ticking. Mr. Bond was sailing in Australia and
unavailable for comment, according to Peter Lucas, Bond
Corp.'s director of public relations.
   "I can't speak for Alan Bond," Mr. Lucas said at a news
conference. But Mr. Lucas added that "clearly there is a
desire" among investors to see Mr. Bond step down. And if Mr.
Bond needs to resign to obtain approval of the company
restructuring, "that is what he'll do," Mr. Lucas said.
   The bondholders have been asked to clear the proposed sale
of Bond Corp.'s breweries to its 58%-controlled Bell
Resources Ltd. unit, and to decide whether to waive about $25
million Australian (US$19.8 million) in interest due on
securities over the next year. Decisions on the matters had
already been postponed twice.
   Yesterday, holders of sterling-denominated convertible
bonds approved the breweries sale. But among holders of U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds at yesterday's meeting, approval for
the breweries sale fell short of the required 75% majority.
To avoid defeat, bondholders voted to adjourn the meeting
without a vote on the matter, and to resubmit it at a new
meeting tentatively scheduled for Sept. 10.
   Support for the interest moratorium fell short of the
required 75% majority among both sterling and U.S.-dollar
denominated bondholders. Both groups postponed decisions on
that matter until Nov. 30.
   The investors also intended yesterday to elect a
bondholders' committee to advise the company. But that effort
was postponed until Sept. 4 because yesterday's meeting
lacked the necessary quorum. Meanwhile, Mr. Lucas said,
investors attending the meeting formed "unofficial
committees" which will try to settle certain procedural
issues before formal discussions begin with Bond Corp.
directors.
   Mr. Lucas blamed summer vacations for thwarting Bond
Corp.'s effort to round up holders of its bearer bonds. But
"there is a very clear indication that the majority of
bondholders want the brewery transaction to proceed," he
said.
