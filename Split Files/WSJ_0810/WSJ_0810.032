   Is It a Folk or a Classical Instrument?

   The phone rings in a modest adobe on the outskirts of
Albuquerque, N.M. The answering machine clicks into gear with
a rip-roaring excerpt from "La Bamba," played by Steve Chavez
on the marimba.
   "You're listening to the fastest hands this side of the
Rio Grande]" proclaims the recorded message. But Mr. Chavez,
a fixture at local cocktail lounges and conventions, wins
kudos for more than his fleet fingers. Since 1981, when he
bought his first Mexican marimba while visiting relatives in
Veracruz, he has endeavored to preserve the rich but
increasingly endangered folk tradition of playing these
oversized xylophones brought to tropical America by African
slaves.

   Each year, the soft-spoken American travels to the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan
border, where he hangs out with the dwindling number of
old-timers who still play the marimba in the traditional
style. "I've worked with some of the masters," says the
classically trained marimbist, who has a B.A. in music
education from the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque.
"I can analyze their playing in terms of chords and
dynamics."
   In the process, he's developed a mind-boggling technique.
On a November 1989 segment of the Southwestern
public-television program "Colores," he demonstrated a
"ripple roll," his virtuosic variation on an authentic
Mexican method for repeating notes in rapid-fire succession.
Mr. Chavez has also acquired eight Mexican marimbas, which he
carted home one by one in a '76 Ford van outfitted with
specially cushioned holders to protect the instrument's
fragile legs and resonators.
   Unlike their modern counterparts, Mexican marimbas have
wooden, rather than aluminum, resonator tubes and are often
elaborately carved. The 34-year-old musician's current
collection includes some old African and Guatemalan
instruments that have bulbous gourds for resonators, and a
new model he is building that is decorated with turquoise
stones and a colored sand painting.
   "I'm the Liberace of the marimba," he jokes. The most
unusual feature of these instruments is a component called
"La tela" (cloth or skin) -- a little piece of bat's wing or
pig intestine stretched across a hole at the bottom of each
resonator pipe that gives the folk marimba its characteristic
"buzz." "It sounds like a kazoo," says Mr. Chavez, a short,
stocky man who wears his long black hair in a ponytail. "It
gives more carrying power for playing outdoors in the plazas
and parks.
   With his flexibly sized New Mexican Marimba Band, Mr.
Chavez performs more than 150 dates a year throughout the
Southwest, playing his own lively improvisations on
traditional folk tunes as well as more-standard fare. Last
May, his one-movement work for marimba and chamber orchestra
was premiered by the Orchestra of Santa Fe; he hopes it will
stimulate interest in his other compositions, including a
nine-movement piece that employs Indian hoop dancers. In the
meantime, he takes time out from his busy schedule to
demonstrate marimba techniques in local elementary schools
and colleges.
   "It's the only hope for the future," he sighs. "In Mexico,
the kids are all walking around with headsets listening to
American rock."
   Thousands of miles away in Asbury Park, N.J., another
classically trained marimbist pursues a different dream: to
elevate the modern marimba to the status of a solo recital
instrument. "I'd like to do for the marimba," says Leigh
Howard Stevens, "what Segovia did for the guitar." That
sounds like an unattainable goal, but the indefatigable Mr.
Stevens is waging an all-out offensive. He plays everything
from Bach transcriptions to contemporary concertos --
literature once deemed impossible for an unaccompanied
performer -- with the technical panache of a Horowitz.
   "Leigh set a performance standard," says John Beck,
marimba instructor at the Eastman School of Music and Mr.
Stevens's former teacher, "that hadn't been known previously.
He introduced the one-handed roll {similar to a tremolo on
the piano} and took four-mallet playing to a higher level."
Most classical marimbists use the traditional cross-stick
grip to hold the mallets scissor-like in their palms. Mr.
Stevens's finger-held grip, a modification of a method
pioneered by an earlier virtuoso, allows rotary motion (vs.
the usual up-and-down strokes) and an impressive separation
of melodic lines.
   "Leigh's use of the mallets," observes percussionist Jeff
Milarsky, a recent Juilliard graduate who plans to teach the
"Stevens" grip to his students, "is almost like piano playing
in its independence."
   Indeed, his 1987 disk of Bach transcriptions for
Musicmasters was a real eye-opener, proving that the marimba
can be played with the same legato touch and coloristic
effects as a violin. The Prelude and Fugue in B-flat Major is
especially remarkable in its contrapuntal clarity and
musicality. Mr. Stevens has also tackled the mechanics of
marimba playing. In 1971, frustrated by the limitations of
traditional rattan mallets, he developed a birchwood handle
mallet to give him a wider reach on his instrument. "I was
considered somewhat of a loon," he recalls. "When you're used
to rattan, birch-wood mallets feel like driving a car without
shock absorbers."
   More recently, the 37-year-old musician began
collaborating with the Ludwig Musser Co. in Indiana, a
leading percussion manufacturer. The effort yielded the
Musser "Plus One," a $12,000 concert instrument with an
extended range and a more accurate tuning system than
standard models, which usually sell in the $3,500 to $8,000
range. While his technical innovations win raves, the 35
works he has commissioned for solo marimba draw mixed
reviews. "They're of debatable musical value," says one
colleague.
   Mr. Stevens prefers to "let listeners decide whether {the
composers} are deservedly obscure or unknown greats." But he
concedes that "you need some measure of success before you
can approach prominent composers like John Corigliano and
Joseph Schwantner, both of whom are now writing pieces for
me."
   Would the marimba be better served by works that draw on
its folk heritage? Mr. Stevens hedges on that one. "Whether
in folk music or concert music," he declares, "the marimba
speaks to the soul in a way that few instruments can
achieve."
