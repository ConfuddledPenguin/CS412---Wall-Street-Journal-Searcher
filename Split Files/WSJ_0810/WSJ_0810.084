   A Lot of People Who Became Limited Partners
   In Real-Estate Syndications Are Finding
   Their Losses Aren't So Limited

   BY NOW EVERYONE who hasn't just arrived from Uranus knows
that cleaning up the S&amp;L mess -- the product of crookery,
bungling and, most of all, the real-estate bust -- is going
to cost a few hundred billion. The government is still a
little vague on exactly how many hundred billion, but
everyone knows exactly who will pay it. All of us will pay
it.
   One group of taxpayers, however, has actual and potential
liabilities far exceeding those of the ordinary individual.
These are limited partners in real-estate syndications. Some
of them were greedy and took the high roller's risk; others
were not and believed they were making safe investments.
Either way, there is no one around to bail them out.

   Hundreds of such partnerships have already soured,
involving dubious investments in resort hotels (the so-called
hotels from hell), Florida nursing homes, office buildings in
the Midwest, shopping malls, and garden apartments hastily
thrown up in the Sun Belt. Even where the investment hasn't
failed, limited partners have been left twisting in the wind,
fearful that their deals may be the next to flop in a
depressed real-estate market that shows no signs of quick
recovery.
   Their exposure is enormous. More than $20 billion of
private real-estate partnerships, mainly speculative shelters
for the rich offering huge tax breaks, were sold between 1978
and 1987, when tax reform stripped away such excessive
benefits. During the same 10 years, smaller investors poured
at least an additional $35 billion into more conservative,
public offerings vetted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   It's estimated that one in five of the latter partnerships
now is floundering. As for the private offerings, there is
general agreement that their investors are in even worse
shape; many of these deals have already collapsed, and many
others appear headed for disaster.
   Meanwhile, some big syndicators have swooned into
bankruptcy proceedings themselves, and on Wall Street the
business of selling new real-estate partnerships is all but
dead. Sales are at their lowest point in eight years. The
only popular sectors are partnerships that build low-income
housing and rehabilitate historical properties, two
activities on which investors can still get sizable tax
breaks.
   What happened? In one sense, real-estate partners helped
finance their own problems. Their syndicates helped ensure
that there would be a real-estate glut -- and an ensuing bust
-- by throwing billions of dollars into properties for which
there was too little real demand.
   But real estate was hot in the mid-80s, and everybody
wanted in. Once, leading partnership purveyors such as
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. could easily raise $500 million at a crack to finance a
single public partnership. This money came mostly from
smaller investors, who put up as little as $5,000 each --
often into "blind pools" whose syndicate operators didn't
even specify (if indeed they knew at that point) which
properties they might invest in.
   The blind-pool approach was common, and so was loading
virtually all the risk onto limited partners. It was and
still is common for syndicators acting as general partners --
those who run the show -- to put virtually no money of their
own into their ventures. Their income source was far safer
and more reliable: fees. These, together with sales
commissions paid to brokers selling partnerships, frequently
consumed 20% of the total take.
   "Limited partnerships are terrible investments, but good
as a gimmick for selling practically anything at big
commissions," says Scott Miller, a partnership analyst in
Houston. "Brokerage firms didn't know anything about real
estate. They didn't have to. These were financial products
put together for the sole purpose of generating fees."
   Other analysts point out that many real-estate
partnerships have been well-conceived, solid and profitable
investments. But they add that investors must realize that
even the best of them are illiquid, long-term ventures,
typically taking seven to 10 years from offering to final
disposal of properties.
   Investors who want out before then generally have to
resort to the informal resale market, as many distressed
limited partners have learned. About a dozen small investment
firms control the action here, and they have been demanding
discounts that start at 30% below the prices investors
originally paid -- when there are offers at all. Buyers are
scarce for public offerings that are in trouble, and
practically nonexistent for interests in private deals.
   Investors in the latter, meanwhile, are facing what
amounts to a double soaking. Stripped of crucial tax benefits
by the reforms of 1986, those private ventures that never
made any economic sense anyway not only have collapsed with
capital losses to the investors but also have left the
investors stuck with extra tax payments besides; under
so-called recapture provisions, the Internal Revenue Service
is dunning them on depreciation taken in previous years on
the venture's properties.
   Still other investors who signed promissory notes to buy
into shelters have refused to pay them, only to be hauled
into court by insurers who guaranteed the notes so
syndicators could borrow against them. "Of the 9,000
limited-partnership investors we represent, maybe half of
them not only have worthless investments but still owe on
their notes," says Herbert Beigel, a Chicago lawyer.
   Sheldon Rabin, a 46-year-old New York ophthalmologist, is
one such client. Starting in 1980, on the advice of his
accountant, Dr. Rabin put close to $1 million into shelters
that bought mostly real estate. "I'm in 15, 16 of these
things, and none of them has worked out," he says. "Every bad
deal that came along, you name it, I'm in it. I really feel I
was lied to and cheated by people who were nothing but
flimflam artists, con artists. They belong in jail with all
the other white-collar criminals."
   Dr. Rabin was after the big tax benefits such offerings
provided, benefits that only come with a fair amount of
speculative risk. But conservative investors in the big
public offerings, which provided much less in tax breaks
(ostensibly in exchange for more safety of principal), have
been badly gored, too. This class of investor includes many
widows, retirees and others living on fixed incomes, and some
feel they were gulled by brokers promising big returns and
playing down the risks.
   "I never, never dreamed it could happen," says Thomas
Russo, a 44-year-old Yorktown, N.Y., electrician. Permanently
disabled by a fall in 1983, Mr. Russo put almost $200,000 of
a settlement from a lawsuit over the accident into
partnerships that haven't worked out.
   Investors in troubled partnerships may find themselves
treated "as chattels, just so much excess baggage to be sold
to the highest bidder," says Laura Ricciardelli, a Chicago
lawyer and partnership consultant. Bankruptcy judges in New
York and Dallas recently let three major syndicators
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code --
Integrated Resources Inc., Southmark Corp. and Consolidated
Capital Equities Corp. -- put nearly $3 billion of their
public partnerships up for sale without even notifying
partners beforehand that control of their interests would be
changing hands.
   Among the so-called workout specialists wooing distressed
partnerships are the same people who helped run them when
they got into trouble. For example, Evergreen Property
Capital Corp., a New York syndicator of nursing-home deals,
is poised to acquire similar partnerships originally
sponsored by collapsed Dallas syndicator Southmark/Envicon.
The irony: Until about two years ago, Evergreen's three
principals were all marketing officials at Southmark/Envicon.
   They got their foot back in the door by forming a
committee that offered to represent the interests of
Southmark/Envicon investors in bankruptcy court, and getting
$600,000 from them to do the job. But most of the money went
to get the very same investors to legally consent to the
installation of Evergreen as the new general partner.
   Does this make any sense? "A small percentage of the
investors told us they felt we had caused the problems in the
first place," concedes Bruce Weinstein, a general partner of
Evergreen and a director of the committee. "But we weren't
the guys managing the partnerships. Hey, we invested in these
partnerships ourselves. We bought our own story."
