   CHICAGO -- Just a day after stepping back into his old
job, Edward A. Brennan started doing what he does best,
rallying the troops.
   The 56-year-old Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. chairman, who took
control of the company's faltering merchandise group, told a
packed auditorium of managers yesterday that their company
has weathered tough times before. He invoked his heritage at
Sears, where both his father and grandfather worked, and
called for teamwork.

   But then came an urgent and ominous message. "We must get
costs under control," Mr. Brennan asserted. "We have a good
idea where the high costs are -- and we need to address
them." Mr. Brennan didn't elaborate.
   The speech signals that Mr. Brennan, who led the Sears
merchandise group to its peak earnings year in 1984 before
moving upstairs, is finally focusing on Sears's biggest
problem. Its costs are among the highest in retailing:
Expenses consumed 30 cents of every dollar in Sears retail
sales last year, compared with 23 cents at rival K mart Corp.
and 16 cents at fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   But some industry executives, stockholders and analysts
wonder what took Mr. Brennan so long. And they aren't sure
he's up to the challenge of turning around Sears. "He was
allowing this to go on," says Russell Thompson, a money
manager at Waddell &amp; Reed, a big Sears stockholder in Kansas
City. "Rather than bring in a top person from outside, they
have a stopgap measure in place. There's no evidence that he
can be successful."
   What's more, skeptics such as Mr. Thompson question
whether the Sears chairman can continue to oversee its
financial service operations while worrying about
merchandising matters such as pantyhose promotions. Mr.
Brennan declined to be interviewed for this article.
   Sears insiders think he can. Despite a string of dismal
earnings reports, they say the two-year-old Sears strategy is
starting to work. It involves adding national brands to the
stores' private-label lineup and setting more competitive
prices while relying less on price promotions.
   Mr. Brennan is understood to believe that he can get
results faster than the former merchandising chief, Michael
Bozic. Mr. Brennan "brings intensity" to the job, says an
outside director. "He brings the background of having done
it."
   But retailing has grown intensely competitive in the years
since Mr. Brennan worked his merchandising magic. Wal-Mart
invaded small-town America, luring away Sears catalog
customers with lower prices and the thrill of store shopping.
Specialists such as Circuit City Stores Inc. and Home Depot
Inc. chipped away at Sears franchises in appliances and
hardware by offering wide selections at low prices. Trendier
chains such as Limited Inc. and Gap Inc. now dominate the
mall fashion scene.
   A recent Los Angeles Times market survey shows how far
Sears has slipped. In refrigerators, a traditional Sears
strength, the company's share of purchases fell to 19.7% in
1989 from 23.5% in 1986; Circuit City's share rose to 19.9%
from 3.5%.
   "Sears has not followed its customers -- and its customers
have moved away," concludes Robert Kahn, an industry
consultant and Wal-Mart director. "It's anyone's guess
whether Sears can get them back," he adds.
   The two-year-old Sears strategy was designed to woo them
back. But Sears has been reluctant to cut merchandise
categories and make space for the revamped departments it
calls "power formats." The only new format now in all 850
Sears stores is Brand Central, focusing on appliances and
consumer electronics.
   The result: Sears is still trying to catch up to
competitors in terms of selection and price. Meanwhile, Mr.
Kahn says, other retailers are already starting to compete on
the basis of efficiency, which involves cost control and
distribution.
   In his previous retailing posts, Mr. Brennan focused on
planning and store remodeling. He built revenue by
advertising special bargains that are outdated by today's
standards. He also trimmed costs -- but didn't slash them.
"They've taken a scalpel to something that deserves a meat
ax," says one industry executive.
   Mr. Brennan's younger brother Bernard used the meat ax
approach to revive profits at crosstown rival Montgomery Ward
&amp; Co. Edward Brennan's move back into retailing is certain to
invite comparisons of the brothers' strategies. Indeed,
people close to Sears say the company's weaknesses became
more evident to Edward Brennan during two months of merger
talks with his brother that ended last week. The younger Mr.
Brennan had proposed merging his company into Sears, but he
wanted to run the show.
   The key elements in Bernard Brennan's turnaround strategy
at Ward were closing unproductive stores, getting out of the
catalog business and dumping unprofitable merchandise lines
such as recreational equipment and home-improvement products.
More than 20% of Ward's employees also lost their jobs.
