   NEW YORK -- The government filed civil and criminal
charges against an alleged insider-trading ring that received
information from a Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom
takeover lawyer in more than two dozen transactions.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan charged Steven L. Glauberman,
a former associate in the New York office of Skadden Arps,
with disclosing inside information to Eben Putnam Smith, then
a broker in the Stamford, Conn., office of Smith Barney &amp; Co.
The information allegedly involved about 29 actual or
proposed takeover deals the law firm worked on.

   Mr. Smith, in turn, allegedly passed the information along
to several others, including Peter H. Jeffer, a former New
York money manager, and Mr. Glauberman's sister, Lori
Glauberman, a former associate director in the preferred
stock department of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. Trading
in these deals, which occurred between February 1984 and
January 1988, netted the participants in the ring more than
$4 million, the government said.
   Mr. Glauberman allegedly continued to pass inside
information to Mr. Smith even after investment bankers Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel and former stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky pleaded guilty to insider trading-related charges in
1986 and 1987.
   Mr. Glauberman, 39 years old, Lori Glauberman, 36, and Mr.
Jeffer, 44, have signed consent decrees issued by the SEC
and, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay back
the allegedly unlawful profits they earned from the scheme.
They have also agreed to be permanently barred from the
securities industry.
   Messrs. Glauberman and Jeffer also waived their right to
be indicted by a federal grand jury and were charged in a
five-count document, known as an information. Mr. Glauberman
was charged with four counts of conspiracy, insider trading
and wire fraud. Mr. Jeffer was charged with one count of
insider trading. They haven't pleaded guilty to the criminal
charges, but it is understood that they have agreed to at a
later date.
   Mr. Smith, who was the principal broker at Smith Barney
for Mr. Jeffer's money-management firm, the now-defunct
Jeffer Management Corp., and Stanley Patrick, a trader at
Jeffer Management, were charged in a 10-count indictment
handed up yesterday by a federal grand jury here. The two
were charged with conspiracy and insider trading. According
to the indictment, Mr. Smith provided insider trading tips to
Mr. Patrick, who used the information to buy and sell
securities for his own and client accounts.
   Each of the 15 counts carries a maximum penalty of five
years in jail and a fine of $250,000, which would total about
twice the profits earned through the alleged scheme.
   The SEC first began investigating the alleged trading ring
in 1987. According to a 56-page complaint filed by the SEC in
New York yesterday, Mr. Glauberman, through his job, learned
information about tender offers, mergers, leveraged buy-outs
and other transactions but was obligated to keep the data
confidential.
   Mr. Glauberman met Mr. Smith in 1981, when Mr. Smith
became Mr. Glauberman's broker, and the two became close
friends, according to the SEC complaint. Mr. Glauberman began
giving Mr. Smith inside information concerning deals Skadden
was working on in January 1984, according to the SEC. In the
next five years, Mr. Smith conducted illegal trades based on
the data in as many as eight brokerage accounts he
controlled, the SEC said.
   In exchange for the information he received from Mr.
Glauberman, Mr. Smith put $50,000 into a special trading
account established in April 1985 for Mr. Glauberman's
benefit. That account traded actively but was liquidated in
July 1987, a day after Mr. Glauberman and his sister received
subpoenas to testify before the SEC staff, according to the
SEC.
   Mr. Glauberman allegedly gave Mr. Smith information on
deals he and others at Skadden worked on. Among those deals
were General Motors Corp.'s successful 1984 bid for
Electronic Data Systems Inc., in which Skadden represented
GM, and Chesebrough Ponds Inc.'s 1985 offer for Stauffer
Chemical Inc., in which Skadden represented Chesebrough.
   Between 1984 and 1986, Mr. Glauberman also allegedly gave
information on the possible bids for EDS, Signal Cos., Mary
Kay Cosmetics Inc. and other companies to his sister, who
made $19,135 on the transactions, according to the SEC.
   The SEC has also charged Jeffer Management, Anthony
Correra and Mr. Patrick in its complaint. It said Mr. Smith
met Mr. Jeffer in October 1984, and Mr. Smith told Mr. Jeffer
to buy certain securities based on information Mr. Smith
allegedly received from Mr. Glauberman. Mr. Smith allegedly
profited on the commissions from those trades.
   Mr. Correra, a research analyst at Jeffers Management, and
Mr. Patrick, allegedly learned of Mr. Smith's tips and also
began trading for their own accounts through him.
   The SEC said Mr. Correra has agreed to be barred from the
securities industry, but may reapply after four years.
   Earl Yaffa, managing director of Skadden, said the law
firm believes that "we and our clients have been violated."
Mr. Yaffa said, "Steve was a trusted member of our mergers
and acquisitions group, and he understood the policies and
violated the trust we put in him."
   Mr. Glauberman, a graduate of Princeton University and New
York University Law School, joined the law firm in 1981. When
Skadden learned of the investigation in the autumn of 1988,
it told him to leave its offices, but continued to pay him.
The law firm fired Mr. Glauberman in July, when it was told
that he would be charged. Colleagues at Skadden say Mr.
Glauberman insisted throughout the lengthy investigation that
he was innocent.
   Mr. Glauberman didn't return calls, and his attorney
wasn't available to comment. Robert Anello, an attorney for
Mr. Smith, declined to comment. Lawyers for Ms. Glauberman
and for Messrs. Jeffer, Correra and Patrick didn't return
calls.
   A spokesman for Smith Barney, a unit of Primerica Corp.,
said, "The investigation commenced after Mr. Smith left our
firm. We cooperated fully with the SEC in the investigation."
   William McLucas, SEC enforcement chief, said the case was
"the product of years of dogged investigative work and was
put together piece of paper by piece of paper." The probe was
principally led by Eric Seltzer, an SEC branch chief, and
assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Robinson.
   According to individuals familiar with the matter, the
government didn't file criminal charges against Lori
Glauberman as part of its plea pact with her brother.
   Other Skadden clients about which Mr. Glauberman is
accused of revealing inside information include Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., SCA Services Inc., Allied Corp., Pay Less
Drug Stores Northwest Inc. and Blount Inc.
   Legal experts said Skadden isn't likely to bear any
liability for Mr. Glauberman's actions. He had signed a
statement agreeing that he had a duty to keep information
learned at the law firm confidential.
   In 1987, Ilan K. Reich, formerly a partner with Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, pleaded guilty to federal securities
fraud charges in connection with a profit-sharing arrangement
with Mr. Levine. Mr. Reich served time in jail and was
disbarred.

   STEVEN L. GLAUBERMAN, a former associate at the New York
law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom gave
inside-trading information to his sister, Lori Glauberman,
the government has alleged. Friday's edition misstated where
Ms. Glauberman allegedly got her information.
