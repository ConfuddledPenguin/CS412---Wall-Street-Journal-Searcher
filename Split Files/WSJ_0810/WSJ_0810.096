   ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Ratners Group PLC raised its tender
offer for the junk bonds of Kay Jewelers Inc. to 90% of face
value, removing a major obstacle to Ratners's proposed
acquisition of the U.S. jewelry retailer.
   Ratners increased its original offer of 75% of face value
for the $150 million in junk debt after holders balked and
tendered virtually none of the bonds. Ratners's stock-swap
acquisition offer for Kay is conditioned on acquiring more
than 50% of each of Kay's two junk issues.

   One bond issue, with a face value of $100 million, allows
holders to force any buyer of Kay to redeem the bonds at full
face value. Ratners said that about $75 million of those
bonds were tendered at the new price, which was reached after
talks with bondholders that ended yesterday.
   Although Ratners has so far managed to acquire only about
10% of the other bond issue, analysts said that the British
jewelry firm is likely to pick up the rest under the new
offer.
   "This was the only major stumbling block to the deal,"
said Robert M. Winer, an analyst with Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co.
"Now it will be consummated."
   The stock-swap acquisition is expected to be completed in
mid-October, said Richard Miller, chief financial officer of
Ratners's U.S. unit, Sterling Inc. Ratners values the offer
at $17 a share, although analysts say that based on the price
of Ratners's shares, the new convertible preferred stock is
worth $14 to $15 a share.
