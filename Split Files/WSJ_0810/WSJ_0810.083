   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Metropolitan Ciruits Inc. said that
General Electric Co. filed a $1.7 million lawsuit against the
company to collect certain debts.
   A General Electric spokesman said the debt for its sale to
Metropolitan Circuits of copper-clad laminate was due more
than a year ago.

   Metropolitan Circuits, a circuit-board maker, said last
month that it would sell options to buy as much as a 37.5%
interest in the company to two consultants, if they prove
successful in raising new capital for the company. "For
Metropolitan to continue doing business, the financing is
absolutely essential," said Richard J. Sandberg, chairman,
president and chief executive officer. Kenneth C. Cleveland
and Paul G. McNamara also would become the company's top
executives if they raise between $2 million and $3.5 million
within a month, Mr. Sandberg said July 17.
   If the consultants are successful, the financing would be
used for, among other purposes, retiring the General Electric
debt, Metropolitan said.
