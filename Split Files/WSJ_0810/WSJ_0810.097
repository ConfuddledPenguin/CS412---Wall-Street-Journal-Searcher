   BAHRAIN -- On the run, Kuwait's royal family is behaving
much as it does when it runs Kuwait: living better than the
average Kuwaiti, but not too much better.
   While the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, and his immediate
family fled their palace by helicopter on the morning of the
Iraqi invasion, most members of the vast extended family were
left to fend for themselves. Like thousands of other
Kuwaitis, they made their way out by car across desert
borders to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

   Dusty Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars fill the parking lot of
the Bahrain Sheraton, where several dozen al-Sabahs are
registered, filling the luxury suites and spilling over into
standard hotel rooms. The Kuwaiti Embassy is putting up
ordinary Kuwaitis at only slightly less-plush hotels such as
the Holiday Inn. The only major difference is that Bahrain's
prime minister pays courtesy calls on the Sheraton-based
refugees. "This is a small place," observes one Bahraini
somewhat apologetically. "We don't have enough palaces for so
many royal guests."
   Members of the royal family don't want to be quoted by
name, saying that the emir should do the talking for the
family in such a crisis. But a few shared their grief and
anxiety, both for their lost kingdom and their family's
uncertain future.
   "We don't know where half the family is -- who got out,
who is still there," says one al-Sabah woman, nervously
dragging a hand through her long dark hair. Half a dozen
female relatives of varying ages sit around the small hotel
room, their dress and faces telling of family fortunes that
have changed radically in a single lifetime.
   The face of the oldest woman, in her 70s, bears the
distinctive blue tatoos of a tribal bedouin, while her
leathery brown skin hints at a youth spent outdoors in
Kuwait's harsh desert climate. Speaking only Arabic, she sits
swathed in a black cloak, or "abaya."
   The youngest woman, by contrast, wears a smart green
dress, speaks fluent English, and has the creamy complexion
of 25 years of living in the lap of luxury.
   The al-Sabah family has ruled Kuwait since 1752, elected,
more or less, from among the nomadic tribes who settled down
by some brackish springs on the Persian Gulf. But until World
War II and the beginning of oil production, being a Kuwaiti
royal wasn't much to boast about. In 1918, a British official
wrote that the then-ruler "and his sons are perhaps among the
worst-dressed and ill-lodged residents of the place."
   Older members of the family remember Sheik Salim, the
ninth ruler, riding through the market, or "souq," most
mornings to chat with his subjects and listen to their gripes
over coffee in a cafe named Abu Nashi.
   Such informality ended as Kuwait expanded, but one
al-Sabah woman says the current ruler, Sheik Jaber, sometimes
wound his headdress over his distinctive beard and went
shopping in the fish market to catch up with street gossip.
One daughter of a previous ruler recalls growing up in the
royal "palace" -- at that time a somewhat dilapidated
mudbrick pile without air conditioning.
   Petrodollars changed everything, bringing the al-Sabah
unimaginable riches. But while they became billionaires,
plenty of other Kuwaitis became millionaires. And even the
humblest saw their children become educated, multilingual
doctors and engineers through the state's lavish provision of
free education. "You can still find a poor Saudi, but you
can't find a poor Kuwaiti," says a Western diplomat.
   The Iraqi invasion may change that. Some of the al-Sabah
are arriving in Bahrain penniless, relying on government
handouts even to buy a cigarette. But most wave away their
financial predicament, either because poverty is
unimaginable, or because other fears are paramount.
   In the Sheraton lobby, al-Sabah men, some in traditional
long white "thobes," others in Lacoste sports shirts, cluster
around a news ticker to read the latest headlines. "We might
be al-Sabah, but we are no better off than you for knowing
what's happening," says one.
   "We can't even find out if Jaber is going to Cairo for the
Arab summit."
   President Bush said Wednesday that he wants the al-Sabah
emir reinstated as ruler. The family he is backing has
generally ruled wisely, investing its oil wealth and building
a fat "fund for future generations" while other oil states
dip into their financial reserves and even borrow money. They
also have allowed a measure of democracy, although only 10%
of the population of 1.7 million has the vote and the
Parliament has been dissolved when it questioned ruling
family corruption or criticized Kuwait's powerful neighbors.
Non-citizens -- some 60% of the population -- rarely get much
share of the state's lavish benefits or its luxury living
standards.
   Although Kuwait means "little fort," the city state has a
complete absence of martial tradition. Instead, it has
survived until now by shrewd diplomacy and remaining
ostensibly neutral.
   The ruling family, like any group of people of its size,
has had its share of scandals. Last year, a British court
awarded damages against two al-Sabah women when their Indian
maid sued them for brutally beating and humiliating her.
   More typical, however, is Hussa al-Sabah, the
Oxford-educated director of Kuwait's Islamic Museum. She and
her husband, also a member of the ruling family, used their
personal fortune to assemble a collection of Islamic artwork
ranging from ruby-encrusted Moghul daggers to rare antique
Persian carpets, all of which are displayed in a public
museum. The fate of that collection, like so much else in
Kuwait, is uncertain amid reports of shelling and looting.
   In an interview before the Iraqi invasion, Shieka Hussa
spoke of her fears that Kuwait would one day "be devoured" by
its powerful and unpredicable neighbors. She also worried
about her 19-year-old daughter's generation -- al-Sabahs who
had grown up entirely removed from any hint of hardship or
challenge.
   "People my age knew the pearl-divers and traders who had
to work so hard to make a living," she said. "I'm worried
that our children will be spoiled, will have nothing to
strive for." Now, the invasion makes such fears look
unfounded. Even if Kuwait is liberated and the al-Sabahs
restored, reconstruction is likely to provide ample
challenges.
   Says one royal refugee, "What we are facing is
catastrophe."
