   BY NOW YOU'VE READ, in this special report and elsewhere,
about the bust in both commercial real estate and the
residential market. But a couple of questions remain. Why did
it happen when it did? And whose fault is it?
   Too much easy credit and too much greed, leading to too
much building, right? True as far as it goes, but it doesn't
go very far.

   The fundamental cause of the real-estate bust of the 1980s
was the way inept and perhaps craven politicians and
bureaucrats destroyed an archaic but crudely effective system
for regulating the flow of credit in this country. This
single series of events brought us a decade in which thrifts,
banks, insurance companies, syndicators and developers ran
amok.
   It all starts back in 1933, when President Franklin
Roosevelt got Congress to pass a law authorizing 100% deposit
insurance. Most other industrialized countries only partially
insure accounts. As a result, they have just a comparative
handful of lending institutions, which are very large and are
closely supervised by a central bank or other national
authority. Conversely, because this country's 100% deposit
insurance made size and capital strength irrelevant, the U.S.
system had spawned more than 20,000 banks and thrifts as of
five years ago. The maze was made even more complex because,
in a bow to our peculiar federal system, deposit insurance
was offered to state-chartered institutions as well as to the
federally controlled ones.
   The nation's nascent state and federal regulatory agencies
couldn't possibly supervise so many institutions very
closely. But the banks and thrifts were reined in by ceilings
on the interest rates they could pay to attract deposits; in
addition, thrifts could make only home loans. By federal law,
banks and thrifts could offer no more than 5 1/4% to 5 1/2%
on savings accounts, and the Federal Reserve Board
periodically fought inflation by driving rates just above
that level. Such Fed moves caused money to flow out of banks
and thrifts and into Treasury bills; that dried up credit and
contracted the economy. Real estate, particularly residential
construction, was always the first to feel the pinch.
   This arrangement worked relatively well until President
Johnson, President Nixon and Congress essentially inflated
the economy starting in the mid-1960s to pay for both the
Vietnam War and the Great Society, a process of deficit
financing that has never stopped. The government-induced
inflation often kept market interest rates above the level
that depository institutions were allowed to pay. Then, in
October 1979, to break the back of that inflation, the
Federal Reserve Board decided to let interest rates rise
without intervening to hold them to a predetermined level.
Those developments raised the prospect of perpetual credit
crunches.
   Alarmed by the inability of banks and thrifts to either
raise their own rates or make profits in an environment they
themselves had created, Congress and the Carter and Reagan
administrations from 1980 to 1982 dismantled all restrictions
on the flow of money to banks and thrifts. Congress, led by
Democratic Rep. Ferdnand St Germain and GOP Sen. Jake Garn,
passed laws that approved deposit insurance up to $100,000 an
account, removed all interest-rate ceilings, and allowed
thrifts to invest in real estate and make commercial
real-estate loans. To avoid large-scale defections by
state-chartered thrifts to a federal charter, the states with
the biggest real-estate markets quickly drove deregulation
even further, giving almost unlimited investment powers to
their savings and loan associations. Thus freed of such state
and federal shackles, thifts and banks could accelerate
lending no matter what the Fed did. Most of that lending
growth was to come in real estate.
   Congress then poured gasoline on this smoldering mess by
passing the Tax Reform Act of 1980, which provided powerful
tax incentives for real-estate investment by individuals.
There was no obvious need for more office buildings and
apartments at that time. But through contributions and other
favors, the real-estate lobby managed to persuade Congress to
do the wrong thing, another process that hasn't ended.
   The results were roughly akin to what happened when
commercial banks during the 1970s recycled Middle East
petrodollars into bad Third World loans. Lenders recycled an
explosion of deposits and investments into bad real-estate
loans and wrongheaded developments. After the severe
recession of 1981-82, real-estate lending and investment
soared. Thrift assets grew from $700 billion in 1982 to a
peak of $1.35 trillion in 1988. Bank real-estate loans more
than doubled, to $760 billion, from 1982 to 1989. Syndicators
and insurance companies increased their lending by huge
amounts as well. The country entered its most sustained
period of real-estate boom. Single-family starts, for
instance, have exceeded one million units every year since
1983, an unprecedented performance.
   The Federal Reserve Board could no longer quickly stop
this kind of credit explosion. And the various regulators not
only failed to adequately supervise syndicators, insurance
companies and depository institutions, but also allowed banks
and thrifts to operate with less and less capital, their only
cushion against losses. Beginning with Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman Richard Pratt, thrift regulators even allowed
insolvent institutions to grow mightily. State regulators in
California and Texas allowed any developer who could fog a
mirror with his breath to take over or start S&amp;Ls, a mistake
that would prove even more grievous than the federal
regulators'.
   Other institutions that were supposed to help monitor the
system also failed in their responsibilities. From 1983 to
1987, investment banks raised $3 billion of equity for many
mutual savings banks with no real capital, such as Meritor
and Goldome, by taking them public. The $3 billion was
leveraged into more than $50 billion of loans, mostly in real
estate. Without real capital, these institutions had little
hope of success and have mostly failed or are failing. The
Securities and Exchange Commission took no action to warn the
public of what was happening. A legion of lawyers,
accountants, appraisers and economists also failed the system
in their putative role as fiduciaries. As an economic
consultant at the time, Alan Greenspan, the current Fed
chairman, was among them, enthusiastically endorsing direct
investment in real estate by S&amp;Ls. That endorsement came in a
1984 study paid for by Charles Keating, the notorious thrift
financier.
   Driven by an endless supply of credit and tax incentives,
a horde of builders and their lending institutions, many of
them run by crooked or negligent developers, did what comes
naturally. Operating in a void created by Congress and
lacking restraint from the Reagan administration and state
regulators, the builders threw up thousands of office
buildings, strip malls, apartment buildings and homes that
soon far outran demand.
   A bust was inevitable even without an economic downturn,
but starting in the mid-1980s, regional recessions rolled
through Texas and the rest of the energy belt, then through
Arizona, then through the Northeast. Congress did its own bit
to obliterate demand by passing the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
suddenly removing all of the ill-advised tax incentives that
helped create the overbuilding in the first place. In 1989,
Congress belatedly passed the thrift-cleanup legislation,
which forced S&amp;Ls out of real-estate development. The bank
regulators likewise cracked down on their institutions last
year, also way too late.
   Now glut, illiquidity and spent demand characterize most
real-estate markets in this country. Prices of many
properties, including homes, have fallen by 25% to 30% in
depressed areas -- more if inflation is counted. In 1989,
thrifts lost $17.9 billion on real-estate loans, compared
with $829 million in 1982; banks lost $3.43 billion, compared
with $211 million. Insurance companies held $5.46 billion of
bad real-estate loans at year end, up from $1.68 billion in
1982. The biggest losses of all will come over the next
decade: $400 billion to $500 billion for the thrift-industry
cleanup.
   It was all predictable and avoidable, given a competent
political administration of this country's credit system.
Economist Albert Wojnilower noted in 1980 that Congress had
severed the Fed's ability to control credit and could
therefore expect untoward consequences. And Mr. Pratt, the
bank-board chairman, warned in writing, just before leaving
office in 1982, that undercapitalized lenders would have to
be strictly supervised by a much enlarged regulatory staff, a
warning ignored by both Congress and the Reagan
administration.
   The mismanagment of our credit system becomes even more
obvious if contrasted with that of other countries. In the
United Kingdom, for instance, home values have recently
fallen by 5% to 25%, mainly because of high interest rates,
and big commercial projects are suffering, because of the
rates and overbuilding. While small developers are failing
and large ones are taking losses, the big commercial banks
haven't been severely hit. Relatively few in number, they can
be closely watched by the central bank, which periodically
prods them into relative prudence. They were warned by the
Bank of England many months ago to ease up on real-estate
development loans. They may eventually take losses, but
nothing of the magnitude of the American commercial banks.
   Moreover, none of the U.K.'s thrifts, called building
societies, are failing. The deposit-insurance system there,
which insures only 90% of accounts and then only below 18,000
pounds (about $33,000), has never been used to pay off a
failure. The thrifts were allowed to invest in commercial
real estate and other new areas starting in 1986, but were
held to stiff capital requirements that protect the insurance
fund. Mark Boleat, chief executive officer of the Building
Societies Association, also notes that there have only been
eight national thrift commissioners in 150 years, providing
order and expertise lacking in America's patronage system,
which results in new thrift regulators every two or three
years.
   "The American failure was the failure of regulation" of
credit, Mr. Boleat observes. Congressional hearings and
regulators' pursuit of wrongdoers fail to put the blame where
it mostly belongs -- with congressmen, administration
officials and regulators. "If a department store leaves its
doors open at night and piles of goods on the shelves," Mr.
Boleat says, "you don't blame the ransackers" as the main
cause of the problem.
