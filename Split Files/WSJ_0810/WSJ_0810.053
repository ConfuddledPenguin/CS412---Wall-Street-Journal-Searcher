   In differing with a previous article by Martin Feldstein
and my article of June 19 arguing that the S&amp;L bailout should
not be viewed as adding to the current deficit, Herbert Stein
("A Little S&amp;L Budget Honesty, Please," editorial page, June
25) uncharacteristically adds to the widespread confusion.
   Mr. Stein argues that money that the S&amp;Ls "stole" or
"invested in projects that were no good . . . crowded out . .
. productive investment." He suggests that an increase in
taxes or a reduction in government expenditures would bring
about now an increase in compensating investment.

   But an increase in taxes or a cut in transfer payments
like Social Security, forcing households to spend less, may
well discourage business investment as the need for capacity
to meet consumer demand falters. And cuts in government
expenditures for investment -- in roads, bridges, airports,
research, education and health -- would only compound the
problem for the economy and for business investment as well.
   Mr. Stein is on most questionable ground, though, in
concluding that the S&amp;L losses resulted in less "productive"
investment. Paradoxically, most of the S&amp;L loans resulted in
more, not less, investment. Many homes were financed by
interest rates that were, at least in hindsight, "too low."
But those homes are generally now being lived in. Many office
buildings and shopping centers were built that did not turn
out to be the best investments, but investments they were.
The economy will undoubtedly get considerable use from them
over the years ahead.
   In fact, the S&amp;L fiasco turned out to be akin to a large
investment credit, no worse I might argue than the
direct-investment tax credits that too many advocates of a
free market have been happy to endorse in the past. It may
have drained some resources for more productive investment
from elsewhere, although this should be shown, not asserted.
But it almost certainly brought on more total investment than
we would have had if more prudent policies had held down S&amp;L
deposits and loans.
   In any event though, the bailout now has nothing to do
with current government expenditures. It is and hence should
be viewed as a set of financial transactions to prevent a
significant portion of the money supply -- S&amp;L deposits --
from being wiped out. It is no excuse for raising taxes or,
for that matter, reducing worthwhile government expenditures.
