   Concerning Peggy Noonan's July 16 editorial-page article,
"Keep The Republican Faith": Miss Noonan is correct -- I and
many of my coevals registered as Republicans in our senior
year of high school because, in 1983, being a Democrat was
passe. She is also right in her assertion that what
Republicans, and Americans, need most right now is Teddy
Roosevelt charging up Spend More Hill to kick some
appropriated butt. However, she goes on to make two more
suggestions (of what the party should be and/or do to "own
the '90s") that are based in a reality other than the one
most of us have been dealing with for the past few (50?)
years.
   First, her depiction of the abortion dilemma is blatantly
misleading. The furor is not the result of a disagreement
over the morality of abortion. I have never met anyone who
likes the idea of sucking a potential human into a vacuum
hose. The issue is whether the federal government has a right
to make the decision for us. The depiction of the thoughtful
couple being gently guided by the right-minded party to a
morally sound decision on child-rearing is, at best,
irrelevant. To many people the choice is this: Try to survive
as a poor, single woman with no education or resume-quality
experience, or try to survive as a poor, single mother with
no education or resume-quality experience.

   Second, it seems more than a little revisionist to assert
that Republican arms-mongering has kept the U.S. out of a war
for the past 50 years. Perhaps the history books do not label
them as such, but Korea, Vietnam and Panama were certainly
not tea parties. I wonder how much safer for democracy the
world would be today if we had funneled all the time, energy
and capital invested in the defense industry toward
education, infrastructure and the eradication of hunger from
the face of the planet?

   Miss Noonan, apparently, is not talking to the right
folks. I know many people, myself included, who are 100%
comfortable with their position on abortion and who resent it
enormously when a political party takes it upon itself to
tell them how to think about this most personal issue.
   If Miss Noonan cares to broaden her horizons, I would be
happy to introduce her around.

   Miss Noonan's article was a classic and makes it clear why
she was chosen as a speech writer to help Ronald Reagan and
George Bush in their campaigns. There is a clarity and
sincerity in her writing that is not found in the work of
other political writers.
   She gives a good summary of what has happened to the two
political parties in the past 10 years. The Democrats have
not changed. They are perceived as the tax-and-spend party.
They are not believed to be truly interested in a balanced
budget. They control the big-city machines noted for
corruption and power. They control Congress, and by being
ineffective have the country ready to throw them out.
   The Republicans are strong on defense, are the advocates
of smaller government, lower taxes, prosperity and jobs. They
seem to be more in tune with the voters. Their biggest
problem is the unbalanced budget.
   Miss Noonan outlines a blueprint for continued Republican
success -- stay with their strong points and avoid any
tendency to become like the Democrats. If they proceed in
this manner they can hold on to the executive branch and have
an even chance of taking Congress as well.

   Miss Noonan tries to write and describe what the
Republicans are, and what they ought to be in the future. Her
litany of cliches such as "along came Reagan and we owned the
'80s . . . {we} became the party of the people, protector of
their interests . . . not only on the side of the guys at the
country club . . . we're on the side of the waiters]" Wait a
minute, Miss Noonan, the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and
the Democratic Congress have left this nation in a shambles
whose free fall into economic and moral decay will take over
this nation like an avalanche.
   There has been no difference in the parties as she
describes. Their one interest is in getting re-elected and to
do it whichever way works. Any kind of three-minute TV
commercial that arouses primal carnal revulsion and a neglect
of the principal issues facing our nation is used. The
Republicans are no more on the right side of the issues than
anyone else. No party has been on the right side of the
issues to make America solvent, more crime-free, healthier
and environmentally cleaner.
   The Republicans have not owned the '80s and cannot own the
'90s. The popularity ratings of the presidents for the past
10 years are only because they and Congress gave away the
country and brought imaginary prosperity with borrowed money.
We thought we elected a president to run things, but he was
asleep when a secret government was running foreign affairs
from the room next-door in the White House. Yes, we got charm
and one-liners, but nothing of substance.
   Republicans may have been the party of low taxes and lower
spending, but you can't pick and choose and blame the
monstrous deficit spending on the Democrats and take credit
for the lower taxes. Republicans became like the Democrats
when the Reagan-Bush team signed every budget-busting bill
thrown at them by the Democratic Congress.
   We don't need a Teddy Roosevelt, we need a Moses to lead
us out of the wilderness of decay. Miss Noonan's mere
mentioning the need for some such charismatic leader denotes
the failure in itself of the reduction in national stature in
the past 10 years when she said we "are ripe for a Teddy
Roosevelt." The crumbling of the cities is a reflection not
of the machines but a deterioration of American values under
the past 10 years of Republican rule.

   Miss Noonan's article was spot-on. Democrats came to power
because they had vision, energy and ideas; they inspired
people to vote for them.
   The entire Reagan era came about because the Republicans
showed clearer vision, expended more energy, and had the
better ideas.
   Republicans are in danger of losing the White House if
George Bush equates golf outings and openness to the
Democrats' proposals with the energy of ideas.
   Miss Noonan and Lee Atwater are right; the Republicans are
"the party of the big tent," but we'd better have something
interesting inside to show the prospective customers.

   I can't help but wonder if Miss Noonan will attribute the
S&amp;L crisis, the expanding budget deficit, our disgraceful
educational system, exorbitant health-care costs and the
deteriorating environment to the "protectors of the people,
protectors of their interests" -- the Republicans. If she was
indeed taught to think, as proclaimed, she would realize that
the roaring '80s have left our country in economic and
environmental shambles attributed to both the Republicans and
Democrats. As was the case in the '60s, the stirrings of
discontent across the nation in the '90s will once again
cause a party shift. Let's hope the players will be
different.
