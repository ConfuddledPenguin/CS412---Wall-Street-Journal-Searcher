   WHEN FINANCIAL planner Tim Kochis moved to California from
Chicago in 1979, he was a stranger in a strange land. "It was
really startling to me how much of a religion real estate was
in California," he recalls. "When I tried to explain that a
home isn't the be-all, end-all investment, I was hooted at."
   No wonder. Home prices in the state had more than doubled
since 1974 -- often only to double again in the late 1980s.

   But all good things must end. What Mr. Kochis knew, coming
from Chicago, was that home prices could remain flat for
years, or even decline. In 1981, many parts of the country
began experiencing significant deflation in home values. Even
a Californian who bought a home in 1979 and sold in 1983 was
probably a big, big loser. In the last year, California home
prices have, on the average, dropped close to 8% in
inflation-adjusted terms. Other former booming markets, such
as in New England and the New York City area, have been
hammered even harder.
   Entering the 1990s, buying a home as a financial
investment is more of a crapshoot than at any other time
since the Depression. Fundamental factors, such as
overbuilding and a secular decline in household formations,
suggest that even after regional bouts with deflation end,
home prices might trail or match general inflation for years.
And the ugly surprise to most people is that if home prices
just moderately trail inflation, they are usually financially
better off renting rather than buying -- at least in
high-priced areas where the disparity between renting and
buying is the greatest. This is especially true if they sell
and buy another home every five to seven years, as many do.
   The accompanying analysis, prepared by Mr. Kochis's firm,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, explains why. Absent the "rewards" of
heated inflation, carrying costs overwhelm the benefits of
leverage (that is, using lots of debt to buy an asset).
   Consider an individual who invests the down payment and
other after-tax costs of owning a $300,000 home, and then
rents a home for $1,500 a month. Assuming 5% inflation, the
person's cash hoard at the end of five years would have a
present value of $85,681. If the house has no appreciation,
its equity would have a present value of $48,640. That's a
$37,041 advantage of renting over buying. (Present value
calculates -- in today's dollars -- the worth of a future
return on an investment.)
   If the home appreciates at about the inflation rate,
buying is only slightly better than renting; including the
tax on selling the home, the homewner would be $3,391 richer
after five years than the renter. That tax can, of course, be
deferred by buying another home, and in some cases can be
escaped entirely. But if the investor wants access to his
cash, as he has with the renting alternative, it must be
paid.
   Moreover, selling and buying a home mean paying steep
transactions costs -- broker's fees, loan points, and so on
-- that amount to nearly 10% of the value. So the newly
bought home has to appreciate by more than 10% just to break
even.
   "Given the huge transaction costs, buying doesn't make
sense unless the holding period is going to be relatively
long," Mr. Kochis says.
   Conclusion: An expensive house is a superior investment
only if home-price appreciation significantly exceeds the
general inflation rate.
   Just how often does that happen? Well, it depends on the
yardstick you use.
   Judging from the price statistics spewed out by the
National Association of Realtors and the National Association
of Home Builders, it happens quite often. The Realtors' group
reports that the median price of existing homes nationwide
ballooned 41% to $95,300 in April from $67,800 in 1982. The
home builders' association says the median new-home price
soared 96% to $135,900 from $69,300. By contrast, the
consumer price index rose only 34% from 1982 to April.
   But for most individual homeowners, these numbers are
meaningless. For one thing, very strong housing inflation in
the Northeast and California has until the past 18 months
disguised a significant fall in inflation-adjusted prices in
most other regions of the country -- declines that began as
early as 1981.
   But even within local markets, the Realtors' and home
builders' numbers can be greatly overstated. Much of the
housing inflation previously reported in hot markets was due
to the rise in the quality of the new homes built each year:
Average square footage is up nearly 20% in the past decade,
and more homes have two stories, fireplaces, additional
bathrooms, high ceilings and better floorings. Adjusted for
such quality improvements alone, the appreciation of new-home
prices has exceeded the consumer price index only 12 times in
the past 26 years, and over the entire period only marginally
exceeds the consumer price index, according to Commerce
Department figures.
   In addition, luxury homes tend to become a higher
percentage of homes sold during a crunch because wealthier
people can still buy and finance such purchases. And, perhaps
most important, many owners who face big losses take their
homes off the market rather than cut prices drastically.
   One example: The Realtors' numbers show that Dallas
housing prices have fallen 5% since 1985. That's bogus: If a
Dallas home buyer has to sell, he or she will find that the
price has fallen more like 25% to 35% from what it would have
been in 1985.
   "I don't believe those {Realtors'} numbers," says Donna
Blank, a librarian who just moved to Houston from Dallas.
"People are taking losses all over town." Mrs. Blank and her
husband recently sold their home in a middle-class Dallas
suburb for $78,000, a loss of 25% from the price they
originally paid. The buyer of their house lost $40,000, or
about 25%, selling his own Dallas home.
   To be sure, homes tend to be a better investment the
longer they are held, because periodic spurts of inflation
have tended to bail owners out over time. In periods of steep
inflation, housing is still a great hedge because of leverage
-- you own an asset appreciating at five or more times your
down payment. Also, most owning-vs.-renting comparisons
assume that renters will reinvest all the savings from not
owning a house. That may be giving investors too much credit:
Most people aren't disciplined enought to reinvest all that
cash saved by not buying a home. Homeownership is still
valuable as a form of forced savings.
   Mr. Kochis also offers a few other caveats to his
conclusion: The disparity between rental costs and
homeownership costs tends to diminish in areas that haven't
seen heated speculation; it's sometimes hard to find rental
property that is comparable to a large home that's owned; and
if more people catch on to the pitfalls of homeownership,
rentals will quickly escalate from their current bargain
level.
   There is some evidence that a few people are catching on.
Financial planners (outside California, that is) say more
clients are asking hard questions about home buying after
selling a house. Some economists think the recent decline in
home sales and home prices is being worsened by a growing
realization that the back of housing inflation has been
broken.
   "The cost of buying vs. renting has changed dramatically
and has an impact on housing prices," says Dennis Jacobe,
chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
"Without the {expectation of higher prices}, consumer demand
isn't as much as it used to be."

             Buying vs. Renting: By the Numbers
                                                                                                       

   The table and chart compare the costs of renting with the
costs of homeowning (for chart see WSJ -- Aug. 10, 1990). The
conclusion: Homeowning is a clear financial winner only if a
home appreciates annually at a rate above the general
inflation rate -- and that's far from a sure thing.
   This example shows a renter who invests the down payment
and other after-tax costs of owning a $300,000 home, and then
rents a home for $1,500 a month. Assuming 5% inflation, the
person's cash at the end of five years would have a present
value of $85,681. If the house has no appreciation, its
equity would have a present value of $48,640 -- giving the
renter a $37,041 advantage after five years. But this small
advantage would probably be more than wiped out by the
transaction costs associated with buying and selling a house.
