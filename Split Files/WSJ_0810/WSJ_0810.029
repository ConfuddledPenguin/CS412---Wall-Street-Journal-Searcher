   Chiat/Day/Mojo, hurt by a rash of account losses and
client spending cutbacks, replaced the management of its New
York office.
   Chiat said Jane Newman, who had been president and chief
executive of the office, will be succeeded by Bob Perkins, an
executive who had headed Chiat's direct-marketing unit.

   In a further move, Bob Wolf, chairman and chief executive
of North American operations, will act as chairman of the New
York office as well. Mr. Wolf, who works out of the agency's
Venice, Calif., headquarters, will now spend half of each
month in New York.
   Ms. Newman, 42 years old, was given the new title of vice
chairman responsible for strategic planning.
   The reshuffling, which didn't come as a surprise, is
clearly an attempt to revive the troubled New York office.
This year, the agency has lost the following accounts: Reebok
domestic advertising ($40 million), Sara Lee ($12 million),
Bissell carpet cleaning ($10 million) and Mr. Goodbuys, a
Philadelphia retailer. All were serviced primarily out of New
York.
   The $30 million to $35 million Royal Caribbean account,
also based in New York, is currently in review. Mr. Wolf said
the New York office, Chiat's second-largest, currently bills
$125 million, down from a high of about $210 million.
   Problems in New York, combined with troubles on a smaller
scale in other parts of the Chiat empire, prompted the agency
last week to lay off about 40 people and to cut top managers'
pay by at least 10%.
   Ms. Newman, a Briton who had introduced the British
advertising practice of account planning to Chiat, was
considered cold and unapproachable by Chiat's New York staff,
insiders there say.
   The appointment of Mr. Perkins appears aimed at reversing
the morale and leadership problems.
   Mr. Wolf described Mr. Perkins, 44, as "affable" and "a
strong people person," adding, "He is a really good
administrator and new business guy. He's demonstrated an
ability to get the confidence of the {staff} and to win new
business and keep clients happy."
   Aside from client losses, Chiat's New York office has had
a weak new business record lately, and Mr. Wolf said
new-business efforts would be a top priority.
   American Express Co., for which Chiat handles Gold Card
advertising, has slashed its budget this year, while New York
Life Insurance isn't increasing its budget as much as
planned, Mr. Wolf said. Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.'s Arrow shirt
division has slashed its ad budget at least temporarily as a
result of its March agreement to be acquired by Bidermann
S.A.
