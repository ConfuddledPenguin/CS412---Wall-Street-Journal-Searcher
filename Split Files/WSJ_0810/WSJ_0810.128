   It's a scenario that sends shivers down the backs of many
homeowners; depressed housing prices for many, many years.
But for some analysts, it's the only possible scenario. And
for a simple reason: Prices are beynd the reach of too many
potential home buyers.
   "Housing prices have gone up a lot faster than people's
income," says Michael Aronstein, a principal at Comstock
Partners Inc. "It's going to take a long time to get them
back in line."
   According to figures compiled by Comstock, the hours of
factory work required to meet monthly mortgage payments have
been, for the past decade, at historical highs. The 1980s,
Mr. Aronstein says, were a transition period -- the
real-estate market was lukewarm, as it moved from hot to
cold. The '90s, he says, will be cold, with price increases
trailing the inflation rate through the decade.
   "Factory workers are highly paid in relation to other
nonprofessional workers," Mr. Aronstein says. "If they can't
buy the average-priced house, who can?"
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association
of Home Builders, agrees that in some areas of the country --
particularly the Northeast and West Coast -- affordability is
a problem. But he expects that beginning next year, price
increases, adjusted for house-quality changes, will at least
match the inflation rate. His reasoning is also simple: "The
price of housing is linked closely to the cost ofproducing
new housing," he says. "And with the limited supply of land
and land-use controls spreading, prices may rise slightly
above the inflation rate."

   What are the places that make a home buyer shudder? Here's
one way to tell. Of 100 business centers surveyed, these are
teh 10 with the highest average home prices, usually outside
of the core cities. The prices are based on recent sales for
a 2,400-square-foot, eight-room, four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath
home. The cheapest cities: Midland, Texas; Longview, Texas;
and Casper, Wyo.

   They don't build things the way they used to. That's
certainly true in housing. These days, the typical new house
is bigger than it used to be, with all sorts of amenities
that it didn't have before.
