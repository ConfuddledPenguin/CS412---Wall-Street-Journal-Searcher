   The over-the-counter market ended at its highs for the day
as some technology stocks continued to rebound.
   The market's recent sell-off caught the OTC technology
group already weakened by a string of earnings
disappointments and pushed them lower than they deserved,
traders say. Now those stocks are outperforming other shares
as the market climbs back.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 5.25, or 1.3%, to
412.98, while the Nasdaq Industrial Index, which is more
heavily weighted with technology issues, surged 1.6%.
   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
added only 0.45%. Intel gained 2 1/8 to 39 1/4 after Merrill
Lynch reiterated its investment rating on the stock. Merrill
Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak told the brokerage firm's sales
force yesterday that "Intel's stock price has fallen nearly
enough to discount a 1991 recession impact on its earnings."
   Jim Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist,
says the technology group looks good to traders, adding that
many buyers are being drawn in by the upward swing.
   "If you've got things to buy, you can't just watch it go
up," he says.
   But Mr. Tarantino cautions that guessing the market's next
move is a tough call with investors so focused on the
uncertainties of the Middle East.
   Mitch Meisler, vice president of world-wide equities at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, says that with those uncertainties
haunting stocks, investors "either have to think long term,
or very near term."
   The market is moving higher, but on fewer and fewer shares
traded. Volume fell to 129.9 million shares, making it the
lightest trading day in more than a week. Wednesday's volume
totaled 144.8 million shares.
   The falling volume worries William Haneman, head of OTC
trading at Legg Mason Walker Wood. He says the market's
recovery will remain suspect until more investors
participate.
   OTC advancers held a strong lead over decliners, with
1,202 stocks rising and only 767 falling.
   Apple Computer lost 5/8 to 39 1/2. This newspaper reported
that Apple has joined other computer makers in opposing a
petition sponsored by Advanced Display Manufacturers of
America asking the International Trade Commission to raise
duties on video displays imported from Japan in order to stop
Japanese dumping of the products. The computer makers argue
that higher duties for Japanese displays could price their
own models out of the market.
   Sun Microsystems slipped 1/2 to 29 3/4, leading the most
active list on volume of more than 2.4 million shares. After
the market closed, Sun reported profit of 51 cents a share
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June. The workstation
maker lost 25 cents a share in the quarter last year. Sun
gained 1 point Wednesday.
   Midwest Communications fell 1/2 to 1 1/2 after announcing
that it expects to report a loss of about $1.8 million for
its fiscal year ended June 30. For 1989, Midwest reported net
income of $1 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of
$161.4 million. The company, which installs and services
video and radio communications systems, said the loss is due
to extra costs for its Honolulu airport access control
project and the write-off of software costs, among other
things. As a result of the loss, the company said it won't be
in compliance with some covenants under its bank credit
agreement.
   Eastchester Financial fell 2 1/8 to 9 3/4. North Fork
Bancorp ended its agreement to acquire Eastchester for $20 a
share because of Eastchester's financial condition at June
30. Eastchester reported a loss of $1.1 million, or 31 cents
a share, for the second quarter, which included a loan loss
provision of $2.6 million. North Fork said it would be
willing to make the acquisition on significantly different
terms.
   United Healthcare rebounded 1 1/8 to 17 3/4, after losing
3/4 Wednesday. As reported, the company's chairman, Kennett
Simmons, recently sold his common stock in the company.
United Healthcare says Mr. Simmons sold the stake to invest
in his son's business and to build a house. Mr. Simmons still
owns restricted stock grants and options equivalent to
500,000 shares.
   NovaCare gained 1 7/8 to 20 7/8 after reporting
fourth-quarter profit of 27 cents a share, more than double
the 13 cents reported in the quarter last year. NovaCare
provides rehabilitative therapy to the healthcare industry.
   Lilly Industrial fell 2 to 15. The paint company said its
third quarter earnings will fall below analysts'
expectations, while results for the nine months will be flat
with the period last year. The company cited the downturn in
general economic conditions, which occurred during the
company's third fiscal quarter, as the reason for this
change.
   Immunex jumped 2 to 26 1/2. The company said that the Food
and Drug Administration has approved Immunex's
investigational new drug application for Interleukin1 alpha.
Early next month, Immunex expects to begin Phase I-II
clinical trials to evaluate the drug's safety and effect on
blood-cell growth in patients with cancers that have spread
and are not responding to treatment.
