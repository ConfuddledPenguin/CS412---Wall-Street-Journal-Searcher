   NEW YORK -- After surging through the first half of the
year, small stocks have been abruptly dumped by investors
unnerved by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The result: Small stocks have suffered their worst
flogging since the 1987 market collapse. And analysts warn
that these over-the-counter issues probably will be the last
ones that investors return to, amid widespread fears of
recession and inflation inspired by the Middle East oil-price
shock.

   Why the carnage in small stocks? Doubts that small
companies can withstand the economic fallout from higher oil
prices sent many investors running for cover.
   Small stocks "are often not the industry leaders," so
"it's only natural that the urge to sell them is greater
during a market panic," says Stefan Abrams, chief investment
strategist for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Even among leading OTC issues, investors have been quick
to take their profits in stocks such as Microsoft Corp., Nike
Inc. and Amgen that had outperformed most bigger stocks.
   After briskly outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock
Index the first half of the year, technology and small-growth
companies -- the stars of the OTC market -- were jettisoned
with ferocity. The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which tracks such
issues, gave up all of its 10.9% first-half gain and is now
down 0.9% for the year.
   Other small stocks suffered a worse beating. The broader
Nasdaq Composite Index, up 1.6% as of June 29, is now 9.2%
lower for the year. Similarly, the Russell 2000 Index, up
0.5% in the first half, has dropped 9.4% for the year.
   By contrast, big stocks have been hurt less. The S&amp;P 500
has slipped 3.8% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average has edged up 0.2%.
   In the small stock sell-off that ended Monday, investors
thoroughly trounced both the market's established companies
and its newest entrants. From mid-July highs, leaders such as
software maker Microsoft tumbled to 60 1/2 from 79;
semiconductor maker Intel Corp. dove to 37 1/4 from 50;
athletic footwear maker Nike plunged to 72 from 92, and
biotechnology concern Amgen tumbled to 80 1/4 from a high of
92 just nine days earlier.
   Among new issues, Dynasty Classics Corp. fell to 11 from
18 and In-Store Advertising Inc. plunged to 15 from 22 7/8
the day it went public on July 19.
   In the past two days, small stocks have cut their losses,
rebounding along with the broader market. Once again,
technology and growth stocks are leading the OTC recovery.
   Even before the Iraqi invasion, small stocks had begun to
crumble as some technology and other companies began to turn
in disappointing earnings.
   Often, "there was more speculation than solid earnings
themes," particularly in the technology and health-care
sectors, says Charles I. Clough, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief
investment strategist. "Once that became visible, the market
came apart."
   Exacerbating the plunge in smaller stocks were worries
about liquidity, or the ability to sell shares quickly.
Investors concerned about liquidity often dump shares of
thinly traded small companies first. Brokerage firms also
haven't been as willing to commit their capital to make
markets in OTC stocks after posting huge losses in thinly
traded shares in the 1987 crash.
   "Once liquidity disappears, you see air pockets open up
underneath companies without real products or prospects,"
says Mr. Clough. "What really was surprising," he adds, "was
how dramatic the recent fall was. It speaks to the fact that
there's not a lot of liquidity in that marketplace."
   That's not likely to improve, analysts say. "In today's
world of tight times on Wall Street, there isn't going to be
much liquidity" for smaller stocks, says Greg Smith,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. investment strategist. Mr.
Smith says the lack of liquidity in small stocks is the
problem that most concerns him.
   As dealers remain reluctant to bid for small stocks, some
institutions say they're turning to alternative trading
systems. Jack Laporte, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price &amp;
Co.'s $1 billion New Horizons Fund, says the mutual fund
company has experimented with trading on such computerized
services as Instinet, a unit of Reuters PLC, which
automatically match buyers and sellers.
   "The Street has not done a good job in its market-making
and stabilizing function," says Mr. Laporte, who complains
about the difficulty of finding bids from OTC dealers during
the recent stock market decline.
   Monday, for instance, prices in smaller stocks were marked
down by dealers regardless of whether there was any real
selling interest, some portfolio managers say.
   That doesn't mean that portfolio managers have given up on
smaller stocks. Mr. Laporte is among those who continue to
expect small growth stocks to outperform larger shares, even
in a recession.
   But others say that small stocks will have a slow
comeback. "As people get their courage back and move back
into equities, these issues {small stocks} will lag," says
Kidder's Mr. Abrams. "First, money flows into the big,
liquid, unblemished leaders," he explains, pointing to this
week's recoveries in big issues such as Merck &amp; Co., Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. and, PepsiCo Inc.
   "That's the knee-jerk response," he adds. "You can get
money to work quickly, and you can get it to work in
problem-free companies."
