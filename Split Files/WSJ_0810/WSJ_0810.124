   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Joel Smith, one of the principal
architects of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s so-called "total
quality" manufacturing system, is leaving the company's
troubled transport aircraft division.
   The stunning departure of the 50-year-old vice president
-- which is expected to be announced today -- comes amid
growing complaints by some personnel that the company has
turned its back on the original aims of last year's
reorganization in Long Beach. Specifically, they grouse that
senior managers at McDonnell Douglas are ignoring one of the
key principles Mr. Smith has espoused: teamwork between
white-collar and blue-collar employees.

   Mr. Smith, reached at home yesterday, declined to comment.
   John Capellupo, deputy president of the commercial
jet-building subsidiary here, said Mr. Smith has "chosen to
leave" McDonnell Douglas "to complete an advanced degree" at
Pepperdine University.
   Mr. Capellupo insisted that Mr. Smith's departure was not
related to the company's recent statement that it has "made
some mistakes" in the course of its shakeup of operations
here. Still, when asked if Mr. Smith had been forced out, Mr.
Capellupo replied: "The only thing I can say is what I've
told you. I have no other comment on that."
   Mr. Smith arrived at McDonnell Douglas's St. Louis
headquarters in July 1988, straight from his job as the
United Auto Workers representative at New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc., a venture between General Motors Corp.
and Toyota Motor Corp. The widely studied Nummi venture
builds cars using U.S. workers and Japanese team-oriented
techniques.
   Mr. Smith had been hand-picked by McDonnell Douglas's top
officers to implement such an approach at the aerospace
giant. Profits were faltering as the company struggled to
cope with its status as the Pentagon's No. 1 contractor and a
growing backlog of commercial work that was choking the
production lines in Long Beach.
   Mr. Smith was transferred to Long Beach in February 1989
as part of a reorganization. He quickly became the chief
spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's "Total Quality Management
System," touting how supervisors and rank-and-file employees
could join together to cut costs by reducing the amount of
extensive reworking necessary to correct defects caught late
in the manufacturing process.
   However, the company had a loss of $222 million here last
year, and has been running a deficit of $117 million through
the first six months of 1990, much of that because of
development expenses on the MD-11 tri-jet.
   Last month, McDonnell Douglas announced that it was
eliminating up to 17,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting
drive, including 8,000 slots in Long Beach.
   Richard Rios, the newly named president of UAW Local 148,
which represents about 20,000 hourly workers at the Long
Beach unit, said he has sensed an increasing level of
acrimony between his members and their managers of late. "The
company keeps saying that we better get on board first" to
ensure the success of the total-quality effort, he said. "But
I think the company has to get on board first. . . . Our
members feel like they're getting slapped in the face."
   Mr. Capellupo maintained that McDonnell Douglas "continues
to be dedicated to total-quality management," including the
involvement of the union and its workers.
