   Sierra Pacific Resources said market uncertainty has
caused it to cancel the development of the Thousand Springs
electric generation project resulting in a $35 million charge
on the utility's 1990 earnings. The Reno, Nev., utility
holding company posted earnings of $44.9 million, or $2.05 a
share, in 1989.
   Although several purchase proposals were submitted by
potential energy buyers, the company said it was unable to
obtain long-term purchase agreements necessary to sustain the
project, planned for construction in Elko, Nev.

   Sierra Pacific was the project manager and largest
participant in this independent power project. In the past
few weeks, four companies, Bonneville Pacific Corp.; Foster
Wheeler Energy Corp.; The Pittsburgh &amp; Midway Coal Mining
Co.; and Westinghouse Electric Corp. have withdrawn from the
project, company officials said.
