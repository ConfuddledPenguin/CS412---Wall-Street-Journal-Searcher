   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., continuing
to pound its competitors in the computer workstation
business, posted fiscal fourth-quarter net of $49.1 million,
or 51 cents a share. It had a loss of $20.3 million, or 25
cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
   The company's earnings for the quarter ended June 30
exceeded expectations of even the most optimistic analysts
and provided fresh evidence that Sun's grip on the
workstation market is tightening. In recent months, Sun has
outpaced competitors, most notably Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Digital Equipment Corp., with new models that are faster and
less expensive than prior products.

   Revenue for the fourth quarter was $700.1 million, a 62%
rise from the $431.2 million reported a year ago. "Their star
is rising," said Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist.
   For the year, Sun's revenue totaled $2.47 billion, a 40%
increase over its 1989 fiscal year. Net income rose 83% to
$111.2 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $60.8
million, or 76 cents a share, in the prior year.
   Bill Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, attributed
the company's rapid sales growth to new distribution
arrangements that give Sun an entre into commercial and
office markets. Traditionally, the company has sold its
machines to technicians and scientists.
   "We see a broad diversity of firms coming to us and major
industries are buying our systems, it's just not engineers
and scientists anymore," he said.
   Mr. Raduchel cited a recent order by the New Zealand
Inland Revenue Department, which wants Sun machines for an
office automation project.
   Sun's quarterly results amid a slow growth period for
computer sales presents a bright financial picture for
company. It ended the year with $394 million in cash,
compared with $54 million a year ago.
   The fourth-quarter loss posted by Sun a year ago was the
only such loss for the company since it went public in March
1986.
