   Clearance sales of summer apparel and seasonal goods gave
many of the nation's big retailers lackluster results last
month as consumer demand continued to soften.
   July sales, which analysts said were in line with their
expectations, gained about 2% to 8% over a year earlier. The
Merrill Lynch Retail Sales Index of 17 big retail chains
reported that July sales gains were about 5.7%, down slightly
from a 5.8% gain in June, while Alex. Brown &amp; Sons' weighted
index of 14 major retail chains showed July sales gains
averaging 4.3%.

   Because July results are heavily concentrated on clearance
activity, analysts note that the month can't be considered a
harbinger of overall sales trends. But last month's sales
continued a pattern of sluggish consumer demand, which,
coupled with rising gasoline prices, has prompted retail
analysts to lower their earnings estimates for the second
half of the year.
   "July is a continuation of the underlying tone of the
sales reflecting last month's decline in employment," said
Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
"This raises the probability of a recession developing in the
second half of this year as consumers anticipate higher
inflation and oil prices." Mr. Edelman lowered his earnings
estimates for the retailers he follows by an average of 3% to
4% for the rest of 1990.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., also
lowered his estimates. He expects retailers to post earnings
gains of between 7% and 8% for the second half of the year
instead of 8% to 10%.
   In July, San Francisco-based Gap Inc. vaulted ahead of the
pack with a 28% sales gain at stores open for more than a
year. "Gap has the right fashion at the right times and had
an extraordinarily good month," Mr. Edelman said. Gap shares
closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at
$55.75, up $2.
   At Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's
largest retailer, same-store sales rose 3.1% with strongest
sales in appliances and home-entertainment and automotive
products. This week, Sears announced that its chairman,
Edward Brennan, has reassumed the top management spot at
Sears's merchandising division, reflecting the mass
merchant's growing frustration over its failure to turn
around its $31 billion-a-year retailing business. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, Sears shares closed at
$30.50, up 87.5 cents.
   At K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., the nation's second-largest
retailer had a samestore sales gain of 2.2%. K mart Chairman
Joseph E. Antonini said he was "pleased with the July results
considering the relatively weak retail environment." Apparel
sales, including new fall merchandise, were particularly
strong, he said.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., reported
same-store sales rose 8% from a year earlier.
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., which included for the
first time the sales of its recently acquired Chicago-based
Marshall Field's department store chain, posted a same-store
sales increase of 4.4%.
   J.C. Penney Co., based in Dallas, said same-store sales
climbed 2% in July; at Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc.
samestore sales gained 6%; at May Department Stores Co. in
St. Louis, same-store sales rose 4.4%; while New York-based
Mercantile Stores posted a 0.4% same-store sales rise.
   "July marks the beginning of what will be a protracted
period of weakness lasting at least through the end of the
year, and I've turned bearish on the outlook," said Robert
Buchanan, a retail analyst at Alex. Brown. For the second
half of the year, he joined other analysts in lowering his
earnings estimates an average of 6% for each of the 11
companies he follows.
