   No one sensed danger in the Middle East more quickly than
the nation's airlines. At Northwest, the fuel staff went into
a crisis mode the night before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   All that day, they had watched the price volatility on two
computer screens that provide up-to-the-minute price changes.
By 8 p.m., things were looking grim. "We went home that night
saying we may be in big trouble," says R. Jack Van Der Wege,
Northwest's senior director of fuel administration.

   As the second largest industrial user of petroleum
products after trucking, the airline industry's fortunes rise
and fall with oil prices. Because airlines are also
particularly vulnerable to recession, the industry can be
doubly hurt if rising energy prices also lead to an economic
slowdown.
   Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers,
believes the crisis "puts into jeopardy the very survival of
financially weak carriers," such as Pan Am Corp.'s Pan
American World Airways, Eastern Airlines and Trans World
Airlines. Those airlines say they're taking aggressive action
to weather the storm. But it's clear that carriers with older
fleets -- such as Northwest, Pan Am and TWA -- will be hit
hard.
   Some older planes might be parked, and others might be
sold sooner than expected. But the market for the old planes
just got a lot softer, which creates a whole different series
of problems for several carriers, such as UAL Corp.
   TWA and Pan Am were barely hobbling along anyway. NWA
Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, has been stretching to
make debt payments following a leveraged buy-out. The two New
York shuttles -- both up for sale -- were having trouble
finding buyers. And the proposed acquisition of UAL already
appeared in jeopardy.
   All those problems now are worse. Consider Northwest. When
Alfred A. Checchi was negotiating with banks to finance the
buy-out of the company last year, he projected that fuel
prices would average about 70.2 cents a gallon for this year.
But the price has been well above that even before the
crisis.
   Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner has invited the
heads of U.S. airlines to meet with him next week. "I'm
concerned about the effect of rising airline fuel costs both
on the financial position of the industry and on the
traveling public," he told them.
   Airline executives have already been holding emergency
meetings to figure out what to do. Northwest proposed an $8
surcharge on tickets and other airlines said they'd raise
fares by as much as 10%. Yesterday, carriers amended that:
The new plan is to raise fares 5.3% as of next Wednesday.
   TWA is considering budget cuts of up to 25% in some
departments, but owner Carl Icahn says those have been in the
works for some time. America West Airlines is mulling plans
to shelve the purchase of a fifth Boeing 747-200.
   But price increases during a time of lax demand could
create new problems.
   Carriers also are laying plans to re-emphasize fuel-saving
procedures used before when oil prices have skyrocketed.
These include shutting down engines while waiting to take
off, flying slower at cruising altitude, climbing more
quickly to higher altitudes and extending flaps and landing
gear later on descent.
   Airlines buy their jet fuel as they need it, rather than
under long-term contracts. They haven't yet figured out ways
to safely hedge oil purchases in the futures markets. The
result: Price rises have an immediate effect on a carrier's
bottom line.
   "An airline can start out at 8 a.m. with a delivery of
fuel that costs 60 cents a gallon. Then at 10 o'clock, the
refiner can notify them that price per gallon of the delivery
scheduled for the next day is 75 cents," says George James,
president of Airline Economics Inc., an industry consulting
firm.
   And that's exactly what's been happening. Delta Air Lines
says the per gallon price of its fuel has changed by at least
one cent every day since the crisis began last week. Prices
have gone from about 57.8 cents a gallon last month to as
much as 80 cents a gallon this week -- an increase of 38%.
Northwest says it is projecting that fuel may rise to as much
as 86 cents.
   A mere one cent per gallon increase in the price of jet
fuel adds $160 million to the industry's annual expenses.
   Depending upon how long the crisis lasts, airlines also
could face fuel-shortage problems. There have already been
several small crises. Last Friday, Northwest became concerned
about its Hong Kong service after Kuwait Petroleum Corp., one
of two fuel suppliers to the base, informed the carrier that
it would no longer be making deliveries. After several
telephone calls, Northwest was able to get another supplier
to cover the shortfall and Northwest flights out of Hong Kong
won't be affected.
   But says Mr. Van Der Wege, "We're watching the market and
national news reports literally minute-by-minute for
unexpected developments."
   Another difficult task for an international carrier like
Pan Am is keeping its numerous bases world-wide informed of
price changes. Since fuel costs vary from airport to airport,
Pan Am tries to buy as much fuel as possible at the locations
where it's cheapest.
   Traffic has been slow across the industry, and any further
erosion would hurt financially troubled carriers the most.
Eastern is struggling to woo customers back since it filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in March 1989. Pan
Am and TWA rely on trans-Atlantic business, much of it
discounted travel; because those routes depend heavily on
vacationers, they're unusually sensitive to price increases
and bad economic times.
   "We're on the razor's edge," says Kent Scott, the pilots'
union leader at TWA.
   Midway Airlines, which has been wielding its budget knife
for months, says it will consider a hiring freeze, among
other things, if the fuel situation worsens. "We're sort of
at the mercy of world events," says Alfred Altschul, chief
financial officer at Midway.
   The surge in fuel prices has accelerated the company's
cost-cutting campaign, he says. The day of the Iraqi
invasion, the company's fuel purchasers and revenue managers
huddled late into the evening. "What I did immediately was
reassess the company's expenses. We're looking at whether
we're purchasing efficiently, where our overall head count
stands, what flights we fly -- everything," says Mr.
Altschul.
   Aircraft built in the last decade are 30% more fuel
efficient, on average, than the previous generation's. For
instance, Airbus Industrie's twin-engine A-320 burns 5,200
pounds of jet fuel an hour, while the Boeing 727, which
carries roughly the same number of passengers, burns 6,600
pounds an hour because of its three engines.
   Northwest and TWA both depend heavily on aging DC-9s and
Boeing 727s, while Pan Am has a large fleet of older,
gas-guzzling 747 jumbo jets. TWA doesn't take delivery of
more fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-330s until 1995. The
Trump Shuttle also depends largely on an older fleet of
Boeing 727s.
   Ultimately, some of those planes might be parked, along
with some of UAL's McDonnell Douglas DC-8s, which pose the
same cost problem.
   Industry observers also expect to see airlines retire
older, fuel-inefficient planes more quickly than planned.
Early this year, for example, amid high fuel prices, USAir
Group Inc. told Wall Street analysts it had identified about
70 planes as retirement candidates because they cost too much
to run.
   Even before the current crisis, Pan Am was planning to
phase out some of its older 747s in favor of more
fuel-efficient Airbus A-310s and A-300s, which are already
doing a large part of Pan Am's overseas flying. The company
may speed up the phase-out if the fuel crisis worsens.
   At UAL, events in the Middle East promise, at best, to
prolong the company's exhausting employee buy-out effort.
Faced with an Aug. 9 financing deadline, Gerald Greenwald,
head of the buy-out group, was forced to acknowledge to UAL's
board this week that no banks would commit to financing the
$4.38 billion plan with so much uncertainty in the economy.
   The group received a 60-day extension to the deadline in
order to evaluate the crisis and continue working with banks.
But the outlook is far from encouraging. In recent days, UAL
stock has settled at about $101 a share, its lowest level in
years, making it virtually impossible for banks to justify
financing the employees' $201 a share buy-out proposal.
   Although the buy-out group figured a near-term recession
into its five-year business plan for the airline, the group's
advisers say it would have been virtually impossible to
predict such a steep, swift rise in fuel prices. Last year,
United spent $1.35 billion on fuel. The current run-up in
prices could add $150 million to $400 million to that bill,
according to industry analysts.
   The unions were counting on using aircraft sale-leaseback
arrangements to generate cash to pare down their bank debt.
The leasing market has been soft for months. With the jump in
fuel prices, it is unlikely United would be able to get good
enough prices for its planes, especially the older 727s,
737s, and 747s, which make up the bulk of its fleet.
   Northwest also could find itself in a bind. An investor
group led by Mr. Checchi took the airline private last year
in a $3.65 billion buy-out. Northwest still has $1.8 billion
in debt to pay back.
   The airline was counting on selling most of its planes to
leasing companies to generate cash. But the leasing market
nosedived after the airline had sold only 17 of its planes.
   When the crisis broke last week, Northwest pricing and
finance executives spent hours on the phone with refiners and
oil industry analysts, trying to come up with new fuel cost
projections. By Friday, the company was estimating additional
fuel costs of $180 million this year.
   Even with a fare increase, Northwest "will never recover
the money we've lost in just the past few days" from the
price rises, a spokesman says. Passengers have already
purchased 75% of tickets for flights booked in August, and
30% of the tickets for September flights, all at lower,
pre-crisis fares.
   What's more, Northwest can do little to increase its fares
on its Japanese routes, which generate a fifth of its
revenues, since those fares are set by bilateral treaties.
   Analysts who follow the industry now predict that carriers
will lose money this year as a result of the Iraqi invasion.
Until recently, Airline Economics was forecasting a $400
million to $500 million industry profit. Now it projects the
industry will record a deficit of $1 billion, which would be
the largest loss the industry has suffered since deregulation
in 1978.
   A major concern for airlines is whether a fare increase
will do more damage than good. Demand appeared to be
slackening already. The most optimistic estimates project
that traffic will increase a mere 1.5% in the second half of
the year. Ms. Becker, the analyst at Lehman Brothers, says
she believes that the fare increases "might not stick"
because ticket bookings for the rest of the year "don't look
strong."
   Travel agents also are shaking their heads at what could
be steep fare increases. "This won't be well-received.
Everybody is looking for the bottom-line, best deal," says
Ernestine Judkins, an agent at Amarillo Consolidated Travel
in Texas. "They'll just drive or stay home."
   In recent days, some airlines appeared to be using the
threat of higher ticket prices to buoy sagging advance
bookings. Citing fuel price uncertainty, Delta issued a
statement Wednesday urging that "travelers who can confirm
their plans might be well advised to make their reservations
and purchase tickets now."
   Airlines may have slacked off a bit on fuel conservation
efforts in recent years. The elaborate fuel conservation
procedures initiated after the fuel crises of the '70s "got
de-emphasized" as petroleum prices dropped, says Capt. Larry
Rankin, a Pan Am pilot.
   That may change quickly. Northwest flight dispatchers, who
compute the fuel amounts for each flight, are to gather with
Northwest executives over the next few days to devise new
methods of conserving fuel.
   Certain government procedures and an overburdened air
traffic system also haven't been conducive to saving fuel.
Increasingly, the Federal Aviation Administration is forcing
aircraft to fly in holding patterns over airports for longer
periods before they land because there aren't enough
controllers to handle the planes.
   Carriers also used to keep their aircraft parked at the
gate until just before taking off. But the Transportation
Department, in its monthly report card on carriers' ontime
performance, now counts a flight as late if it leaves the
gate more than 15 minutes after its scheduled departure time.
   So crews leave the gate -- only to spend time sitting on
the taxiway with at least one engine running, guzzling fuel.
