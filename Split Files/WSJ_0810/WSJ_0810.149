   A New York state court rejected an effort by First
Executive Corp. to keep secret details of two reports by a
consultant that the insurance holding company has maintained
are favorable to it.
   The decision by Justice Eugene Nardelli removed a
temporary restraining order that has prevented the New York
Department of Insurance from releasing the reports. Unless
overturned, the decision may make the reports public by the
end of the week.

   The judge held that First Executive had failed to show
"any valid reason" to delay publication of the reports by
consulting actuaries Milliman &amp; Robertson and that there is a
public interest in the material that impels its release.
   First Executive said it will appeal the ruling. A
spokesman said that the Los Angeles-based company has planned
to release the reports with updated information and needs
time to prepare it -- an argument that Judge Nardelli
rejected in court as "unconvincing."
   First Executive has over time disclosed selected portions
of the reports, even touting to Congress the reports'
conclusions that the company's Executive Life Insurance Co.
unit can withstand a variety of adverse financial
circumstances. Oddly, however, it has failed to make the
entire reports public, encouraging doubts that First
Executive may have been selective in its disclosures.
   The reports have been sought under state freedom of
information laws by Joseph Belth, who is the publisher of a
monthly newsletter, "Insurance Forum," and a frequent critic
of First Executive. Mr. Belth, a professor of insurance at
the University of Indiana, said "we had a very strong case
for disclosure and the judge obviously agreed with us."
