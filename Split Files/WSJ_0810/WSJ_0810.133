   John A. Goesling, the Seattle retailer's senior vice
president, said the company isn't "yet satisfied" with its
results. He added, however, that trends in sales and expenses
are "moving in the right direction." Sales increased at a
higher rate and expenses at a lower rate during the second
quarter than the first, ended April 30.
   Mr. Goesling said the company brought its inventories in
line with sales in the second quarter. It also took steps to
cut expenses across the board.
   Profits for the six months, ended July 31, declined 20% to
$49.1 million, or 60 cents a share, from $61.5 million, or 75
cents a share.
