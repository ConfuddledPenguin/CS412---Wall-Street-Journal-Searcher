   PHOENIX -- In the shadows of the White Tank Mountains 40
miles northwest of here, deep in the desert where few but
developers dare to tread, the Sun Valley Parkway bends across
an overheated wasteland of cactus and low scrub. It's a fine
Arizona road, wide, flat, unspoiled, and a straight shot into
the shimmering heart of real-estate disaster.
   For the Sun Valley Parkway is a road to nowhere, virtually
useless except as metaphor for all the grandiose notions and
crazy schemes and alleged fraud that have left Arizona with
its worst land and lending mess ever.

   Built by a partnership of some 1,000 private investors at
a cost of $82 million in 1987, the road was supposed to
provide easy access to the community of Sun Valley. That
there was no community of Sun Valley at the time did not
deter the confident investors, who were led by one Robert
Burns, a Phoenix developer who dreamed up the project. That
little detail would be taken care of in due time, by building
a lovely retirement resort on 48,000 acres of maximum desert
that had been purchased by those same investors for roughly
$100 million more of borrowed money. There would be golf
courses and swimming pools and 300,000 happy residents, and
it would all be worth some $34 billion someday, the
developers calculated.
   Today there is just the road, a welter of lawsuits and a
handful of mysteries in the desert suggesting past human
activity of indeterminate purpose. A green highway sign
proclaims that Sun Valley is eight miles up ahead; someone
has defaced the sign with red spray paint. Eight miles up
ahead are a few bulldozer scratches in the sand, some cement
drainage ditches and a solitary sign marking the nonexistent
intersection of Sun Valley Parkway and 29th Avenue. A fat
dead rodent is draped over that sign, fittingly if
inexplicably. It is as desolate and eerie as ruins left by
any other seemingly advanced civilization that stretched too
far in search of gold or conquest.
   "Sun Valley," remarks Ralph Shattuck, a local real-estate
consultant, "is in total eclipse."
   Much the same could be said for most of the real-estate
sector in Arizona. It's rare for a state to be beset by
simultaneous fiascoes in every cranny of its dominant
real-estate market, but that's precisely what's happening in
Arizona's Valley of the Sun, where Phoenix is situated and
where most of the state's people and empty buildings reside.
Despite almost three years of tumbling real-estate values,
the Phoenix area still has an office-space vacancy rate of
just under 30%, unchanged since 1988. Moreover, the dollar
amount of commercial real-estate foreclosures in Phoenix in
1990's first quarter rose 20% to $2.41 billion, even though
the number of foreclosures declined slightly; this means it's
increasingly the bigger, newer, more expensive office
projects that are failing. In Tucson, the commercial vacancy
rate also hovers at about 30%.
   Apartment vacancies have eased recently, but that's mainly
because construction of new units has virtually ceased. Whole
shopping centers stand vacant, and more are still being
built. And alarmingly, single-family-home foreclosures, which
were relatively low through the early stages of the collapse
before soaring late last year, remain high -- 8,074 through
June 30, compared with 7,832 a year earlier. Prices of some
homes have plummeted as much as 35% in the past 12 months and
60% in the past three years.
   Curiously, the disaster is largely confined to the
funnel-shaped Valley of the Sun, which stretches for 100
miles between ranges of rough desert mountains, Phoenix at
its heart. Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and
Bullhead City never saw the frenzied building that the Valley
of the Sun did and have been plodding along pretty well,
real-estate brokers say. Furthermore, the Arizona economy
outside the real-estate sector is still relatively buoyant;
Arizona State University's Center for Business Research
expects the state's economy as a whole to grow about 3.1%
this year, despite little action in the construction and
housing sectors. And population growth continues to run about
2%, well above the national average; when Texas tanked a few
years back, it was actually losing population.
   Still, two-thirds of the state's 3.5 million people live
in the Valley of the Sun, and 2% population growth is not
nearly enough to make much of a dent in the vast overhang of
empty buildings and raw land weighing on the market. Indeed,
half-finished or barely started projects were based on the
belief that population growth would average 7% annually well
into the mid-1990s.
   So the impact of the bust, at least in the valley, spreads
far beyond just real estate. Small businesses are dropping
like flies. Four years ago, Eddie Alvaro's auto-repair
business earned him about $187,000. He moved his family into
a four-bedroom house in a tony North Phoenix neighborhood.
Last year, the business lost about $10,000. In May, the
business closed. "I used to have BMWs and Mercedes all over
my lot, and I used to live good," Mr. Alvaro recounts,
sitting in the public library with a newspaper in his lap,
opened up to the classifieds. "Now I'm broke, and I'm looking
for work."
   Mr. Alvaro, 34 years old, fears he may lose his house. "I
remember standing in my back yard, looking at my swimming
pool and thinking, `Man, you've got the American dream,
you've got it made,'" he says, shaking his head. "It amazes
me that I'm even sitting here in this place, just another guy
scratching around for a job."
   Jobs aren't as plentiful as they once were, but some
places are hiring. The federal bankruptcy court, for example,
has tripled its staff in the past three years and expects to
hire more to deal with a caseload that has grown from 11,467
filings in 1987 to 16,278 in 1989. Through June of this year,
filings are running 18% ahead of last year's pace. Chapter 11
filings -- filings made by businesses -- have exploded,
running 59% ahead of last June's level.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. is also hiring, which
underscores what is perhaps the most damaging ripple from the
real-estate bust: the demolition of the state's lending
industry. Seven of the state's 10 savings and loans --
representing about $17 billion of the Arizona thrift
industry's $23.5 billion of assets -- are in the hands of the
RTC, the government agency set up to deal with dead thrifts.
They include some of the nation's biggest and most outlandish
failures, such as Western Savings &amp; Loan, which catapulted
huge chunks of money into some of the most remote corners of
the Arizona desert (Sun Valley, for example), acting as both
lender and developer on resorts, trailer parks, housing
developments, malls and about any other project that came its
way. The official estimated taxpayer tab: $1.7 billion. The
unofficial estimate from local real-estate professionals
familiar with Western: $2 billion to $3 billion, maybe more.
   Many of the state's banks are fading or gone, too. And
neither banks nor thrifts are making loans: Total thrift
loans declined by $851.5 million between last Dec. 31 and
March 31. Total bank loans declined by $283.1 million. C.W.
Jackson, a Tempe businessman with interests in real estate
and banking, estimates that the government either controls or
soon will control some $27 billion of the state's $65 billion
in banking assets. "It is my opinion that in coming years, in
Arizona and the country as a whole, bureacrats at the
regulatory agencies will have more influence on the economy
than the Federal Reserve Board," Mr. Jackson says. "That
scares the hell out of me."
   Arizona, of course, has had more busts over the years than
a bad blackjack player. In a sense, the state's whole history
is defined by people's up-and-down efforts to develop livable
-- or at least salable -- real estate out of places that are
naturally hospitable only to cactus and Gila monsters.
   The state was largely the domain of scattered bands of
Apaches and Pimas until well after 1848, when the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican War and awarded Mexico's
vast holdings in today's southwest to the United States.
Modest booms came and went until World War II, when war
production -- and government fears about having defense
contractors located on the West Coast, near waters where
Japanese aircraft carriers might someday lurk -- triggered a
huge defense, manufacturing and housing boom that only
accelerated when the boys came marching home.
   That boom was marked by the kind of can-do boosterism that
Arizona's movers and shakers still pride themselves on. At
one point in the 1950s, for example, Sperry Rand Corp. had
given up on a plan to move a big plant to a desert site near
Phoenix because all the water wells its engineers had dug
came up dry. But John Jacobs, then chairman of Arizona Public
Service Corp., arranged for a noted local water witch to turn
his forked stick on the site; as the story is told here, Mr.
Jacobs had a well sunk at the spot marked by the old man and
his stick, water was struck, and Sperry Rand moved in. The
postwar boom busted in the 1960s, picked up again in the late
1970s, busted again in the early 1980s.
   All the past blowouts featured some of the same suspects
that have figured in the present one: greed, incompetence
and, of course, fraud. Arizona has produced some of the
nation's most memorable swindlers. James Addison Reavis, for
one. A real-estate developer and forgery expert who got
himself out of the Civil War by faking discharge documents,
Mr. Reavis by the 1890s had amassed landholdings totaling
some 12 million acres in Arizona and New Mexico. He claimed
them under old Spanish and Mexican land grants issued to the
Peralta family, whose descendants, he said, had bequeathed
the land to him. He took to calling himself the Baron de
Peralta y Cordova, married a woman after convincing her she
was the long-lost daughter of the Peralta patriarch,
hobnobbed with U.S. senators and even sued the government
when he felt it was interfering with his operations. Only
years later did it become clear that the baron had in fact
invented the Peralta family and forged the land grants --
even going so far as to travel to Mexico City and Madrid to
create a convincing but utterly phony record of the Peralta
family tree. In 1895, he was convicted of land fraud.
   By the mid-1960s, Arizona had been christened the "Land
Fraud Capital of the World" by the popular press for its
abundant scams, many of the variety perpetrated by Dory
Auerbach, the promoter of an alleged paradise he called Lake
Mead Rancheros. Mr. Auerbach blanketed the country with
newspaper ads trumpeting its virtues: "A new community,
coming to life. . . . You can own a king-sized Western estate
with roads and electricty, water and phones. . . . Build now
and move in]" He neglected to mention that the nearest power
and phone lines were six miles away or that the only water
source -- a pipe that jutted out of the desert floor and
operated only when a quarter was deposited -- was 12 miles
away. Mr. Auerbach sucked in millions of dollars before being
convicted of 22 counts of land fraud.
   Some Arizonans find a pattern here, as if it is Arizona's
destiny to skid from one land bust to the next, with
intermittent periods of high rolling and low crime. Partly
the reason is economic: Land is one of the only things that
Arizona has plenty of to peddle. But Marshall Trimble, a
writer and professor of history who has lived here all his 50
years, sees something deeper at work.
   "It is part of that old notion that the West is always a
cornucopia, that every man is a law unto himself, opportunity
awaits those who dare and there is no end to the good times,"
Mr. Trimble says. "That draws a lot of good people." He
pauses, then adds: "It draws a lot of con men, too." It is
also why this bust isn't likely to be the last, he and others
opine. "The only thing we ever learn from these slides is
different variations on the deals, different kinds of
swindles," Mr. Trimble remarks. "There will be future booms
and future busts."
   Still, this bust is distinct in Arizona history, in ways
that mean the state will probably stay busted for years. It's
bigger, for one thing. In Phoenix, despite three years of
slowing construction, there is still about a seven-year
supply of empty office space. More is on the way: Arizona
Public Service and a few other big companies still have
sizable office complexes under construction that will add
millions of square feet of uninhabited chrome and glass to
the skyline.
   As a consequence, commercial real-estate values are still
sliding. A case in point: The RTC recently sold Western's
office tower in Mesa, east of Phoenix, for $20.8 million.
Western had acquired the building, a bizarre-looking affair
featuring blue neon stripes, for $55 million in 1987 from its
developer, Conley Wolfswinkel. Mr. Wolfswinkel, a 350-pounder
who is one of valley's most prominent landowners, once owed
Western about $150 million, but sold Western the building and
several other properties in a complex transaction that was
supposed to reduce Western's exposure to Mr. Wolfswinkel.
   The latest bust is also unique because it has taken the
state's financial system down with it. Between that and the
tough stance of federal regulators, there is almost no credit
available for real-estate deals that might help refloat the
market. Signs of a credit crunch are all over Phoenix, some
of the most interesting being the signs and billboards
advertising Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Bank of Arizona
unit. "We're still lending," the signs proclaim. They're part
of a campaign designed to take advantage of public grumbling
about the tightness of credit, especially for home mortgages.
The signs began appearing about two months before Chase
closed its mortgage-banking operations in Arizona.
   Brokers and developers offer more concrete signs of
liquidity problems. "It is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to get any credit," grouses Alan Kennedy,
president of DeHaven Investments Co., a developer
specializing in raw land. He tells of approaching the RTC
with a proposal for buying a $2 million parcel of land; in
the past, Mr. Kennedy would have expected to put 20% to 25%
down and finance the rest over seven years or so. "But the
RTC said no dice, they wanted all cash," Mr. Kennedy says.
"That's unheard of."
   Further proof of the tough new climate: Mr. Kennedy just
got a letter in the mail from the RTC advising him to find a
new mortgage to replace one held on 11 acres of undeveloped
land DeHaven owns. Mr. Kennedy has never missed a payment,
but the mortgage is held by defunct Blue Valley Savings &amp;
Loan of Kansas City. "The RTC is telling me it doesn't want
to be a lender, so go find another one," Mr. Kennedy
complains. "Well, just where am I going to do that? It would
be next to impossible." He adds: "I have no obligation to do
so, and I don't intend to."
   Regulatory heat is closing off other credit avenues.
George Green, a Phoenix real-estate broker, cites the case of
a healthy bank that refused a mortgage on a $100,000 house to
a man making $50,000 a year who was willing to put 20% down.
The reason: Several months before, the man had made a
credit-card payment late. "That loan would have been a
slam-dunk in the old days," Mr. Green says. Mr. Jackson, the
Tempe developer and banker, says regulators made him classify
as a loss a $150,000 loan to man with $10 million of net
worth. The loan was unsecured, but current. "The regulators
have gotten ridiculous," says Mr. Jackson. His bank, Central
Arizona Bank, failed earlier this year.
   With the traditional credit well running dry, the
so-called hard-money crowd is flourishing, a further source
of potential trouble for the real-estate market. These are
private investors with plenty of cash who will make loans --
at witheringly high rates. Mr. Green says one customer,
spurned by banks and other traditional lenders, got financing
at 15 7/8% from a hard-money operator; the rate means that
the customer -- whom Mr. Green describes as "financially
marginal" -- will pay $400 more a month than he would have
with a more traditional lender. "His house is going to be
back on the market very soon," Mr. Green says. "Hard money
distorts the market even more."
   Comments Ed Preston, a Sedona real-estate agent: "There's
an old saying about Arizona: It has more grazing land and
fewer cows than anywhere, more rivers and less water, more
preachers and less religion. Today you might add, more cash
and less credit."
   So the bust goes on, and monuments to real estate gone
wrong spring up everywhere. From a home on a corner of
Camelback Road, down the way from a canyon of new and largely
empty office buildings, a six-foot-tall yellow sign with red
lettering yelps: "MUST SELL] PRICE REDUCED] MAKE OFFER]" It's
a beautiful ranch house, spacious, three bedrooms, swimming
pool, big fireplace. A scrawled sheet of legal paper on the
front door declares mournfully: "Was priced at $595,000.
Reduced to $385,000. Or what do you want to offer TODAY?
Offer a fair deal. Owner is ready." Another sign affixed to a
wall inside the house refers to the $385,000 and pleads: "If
you don't like that give us a fair offer." The house has been
on the market about a year.
   About 30 miles west out in the desert, not far from the
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Happy Trails resort but not close
to much of anything else, Jim Eastham's sand-encrusted Buick
bumps to a halt along a dirt road. "Do you know where 191st
Avenue is supposed to be?" Mr. Eastham asks a passer-by. Mr.
Eastham, who serves foreclosure notices for a living, is
trying to post papers on raw land so far out in the boondocks
that it doesn't seem to appear on any map or even on the
stacks of plats and surveyor's documents piled in Mr.
Eastham's front seat.
   "You gotta wonder about why somebody'd buy this far out,"
says Mr. Eastham, surveying a broiling griddle of scrub and
cactus that stretches out to the horizon. The temperature is
120 degrees. The site is so remote that Mr. Eastham openly
worries about dying if his car breaks down.
   Incidentally, the Happy Trails resort was another Western
S&amp;L project. It's open but unprofitable. The government owns
it now.
   Other lost places loom up out of the waste every so often.
One spectacular one is Estrella, undertaken by Charles
Keating, the owner of failed Lincoln Savings who has been
cast by many as a chief villian in the thrift debacle. Mr.
Keating and his backers have invested an estimated $200
million in this project. Blacktop winds through mountains
studded with tiny placards marking empty lots. Farther in,
mostly empty houses ring lakes with gurgling fountains. Green
gazebos dot the shore. Mr. Keating still believes people by
the thousands will come here someday, but on a recent
afternoon, Estrella was the private preserve of three boys
who were taking a break from raking leaves to swim in the
lakes and an older gentleman hacking uninterestedly at a palm
tree with a machete.
   Sometimes it's impossible not to marvel at the glorious
indifference to the past evident in many of these projects.
Back out in the desert near what was to be Sun Valley, within
sight of the turnoff for the destinationless Sun Valley
Parkway, a single, rusted sign rears up out of the desert
sand, faded lettering just visible. "West Phoenix Estates,"
it says. Close inspection reveals rusted-out lot markers
poking up, almost reclaimed by the desert. The foundations of
roads scraped out of the sand like the ancient Nazcla lines
of Peru stretch toward nothing in particular.
   West Phoenix Estates was the Sun Valley of a different
time, started in the 1970s and quickly abandoned to one of
that era's busts. Kevin Hull, a construction worker who has
lived out in the desert since 1972, remembers the developers
then. "They were just like these Sun Valley guys," he
remarks. "They were going to make everybody rich. You'd think
these people would learn something from experience, but I
guess not."
