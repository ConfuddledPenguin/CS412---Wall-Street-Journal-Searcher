   BUSH'S MOVES to counter Iraq win support so far, but big
risks lie ahead.
   "The policy is succeeding," says Nicholas Veliotes,
formerly the State Department's top Mideast diplomat.
Jordan's agreement to abide by the trade embargo gives a
crucial boost to the international ban. Otherwise, Jordan
could have been a conduit for food and other goods to Iraq.

   But even if Iraq's Hussein just remains in Kuwait, he can
intimidate Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. Terrorism is
a major threat. Two top terrorists, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas,
have been in Baghdad. A Damascus group accuses the U.S. of
"enlarging the circle of fire in the Gulf region."
   Most experts think Saddam Hussein gains from a war of
attrition. "The longer it goes, the more voices of impatience
and appeasement will emerge," predicts one top lawmaker.
                                                                                                       

   IRAN AND SYRIA are likely winners in the U.S.-Iraqi
confrontation.
   Iran, which has long despised Iraq and Kuwait, quietly
rejoices over their problems. A fuel-price surge would help
its sick economy. Rafsanjani could try to restore ties to the
West. "We need to create a counterweight to Iraq," says Shaul
Bakhash, a Mideast expert at George Mason University, "and
Iran is the only choice."
   The U.S. wants Syria to keep an oil pipeline from Iraq
closed. Syria's Assad, a foe of Saddam Hussein, is "grinning
ear to ear watching the whole world scramble to try to defeat
Saddam," says Judith Kipper of Brookings Institution. "And
when it's over, he'll try to pick up the gains." But the
crisis also bolsters U.S.-Israeli ties and sets Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, not Assad, as the Arab world's strongman.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS SEE gains, with Iraqi turmoil giving Bush only a
brief boost.
   The Iraqi crisis "is a big boon for President Bush in the
short term," says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, but GOP
candidates will "be hurt if he gets bogged down in the Gulf
or if there are long gas lines." Early Republican hopes of
picking up three to four Senate seats already were fading.
   Democrats are cheered by Ted Muenster's inroads against
South Dakota Sen. Pressler and GOP Rep. Tauke's failure to
make expected gains against Iowa Sen. Harkin. The costly
Michigan primary drained GOP coffers, boosting Democratic
Sen. Levin's chances. In Indiana, Baron Hill begins a new ad
offensive blasting Sen. Coats's use of free congressional
mail.
   But Republicans still predict a net Senate gain by holding
all their current seats and taking a few Democratic ones,
such as Hawaii.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ BENEFITED greatly from U.S. aid. Iraq has received
about $5 billion in food subsidies since 1983, $2.5 billion
in export loan guarantees since 1988 and $141 million in
direct export subsidies since 1985. The guarantees were
suspended this year because of abuses, and all other aid was
cut off by the current embargo.
                                                                                                       

   BAD TIMING: Some 38 senators sought to weaken a move to
cut off U.S. credits for food exports to Iraq less than a
week before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The effort to
continue credits, backed by agricultural interests, was led
by Texas GOP Sen. Gramm and supported by such prominent
senators as Bentsen and Dole.
                                                                                                       

   WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS were hired by Iraq until earlier this
year. Iraq paid the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp;
Walker $360,000 to counsel it on U.S. policy and to handle
some litigation from 1986 until this March. Public-relations
man Edward Van Kloberg III recently got $3,000 for helping on
letters to the Washington Post and other newspapers and has
received $10,000 more since 1985.
                                                                                                       

   SECOND THOUGHTS arise about past rejections of U.S. sales
of Maverick missiles and other arms to Saudi Arabia. Bush
officials will review prior Saudi requests in light of the
Iraqi threat, and "I think we in Congress would be happy to
do that as well," says Sen. Metzenbaum, who often led the
fights against requests.
                                                                                                       

   THE GULF CRISIS fuels demands for action on energy and
defense.
   Environmental groups push a pending bill to require new
cars to average 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000. The
crisis is likely to help Air Force efforts to keep buying
F-15 and F-16 fighters. New fuel-surcharges mean the proposed
airline departure tax is "deader than dead," a Senate aide
says. A move to restore House cuts in military aid to Turkey
is likely.
   Pressure grows to increase the U.S. oil reserve.
Influential Sen. Boren talks of a tax break for oil companies
if prices fall below a certain level; it's the only way some
domestic drillers can get bank loans, he says. But a new GAO
study says more oil tax breaks would lift U.S. output only to
a "limited extent" and could cost between $3 and $14 a barrel
in lost tax revenues.
   Barring a wider crisis, there may be more rhetoric than
action. Costly weapons, such as the B-2 bomber, aren't likely
to be rejuvenated.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Just before the Iraqi crisis, the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy issued a report predicting
that "stable or decreasing prices will be the dominant
feature of the oil market of the 1990s." . . . Some
movie-goers suggest making a film about the crisis and
calling it "Iraqiphobia.". . . Jay Leno, noting that Bush had
frozen Iraqi assets, suggests a tougher move: "How about
putting all their assets in a savings and loan?"
