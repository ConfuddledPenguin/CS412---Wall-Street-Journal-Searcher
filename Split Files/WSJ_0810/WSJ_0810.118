   Ever drive your car through a "falling rock zone"?
   Most people keep going pretty much as usual, but with one
eye nervously scanning the cliffs. That's how many money
managers, including the four in this column's stock picking
contest, are investing these days: pretty much as usual, but
with one eye on the Middle East.

   "If this thing in Kuwait does not escalate into something
really frightening," the Dow Jones Industrial Average will
probably stabilize around 2400 to 2600, said R. Jerry
Falkner. Mr. Falkner, the contest's winner for the six months
ended in July, is director of research for Southeast Research
Partners in Boca Raton, Fla., an affiliate of Dominick &amp;
Dominick. He said rising oil prices will probably "tip us
over into a recession."
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was "a major shock," said Remy
Fisher, runner-up for the six-month period and a vice
president with J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., a New York
money-management firm. She said most stocks have been selling
at 14.5 times estimated 1990 earnings; that multiple could
drop to 12.
   "I didn't expect very much {from the market} before, and
now I expect even less," said John Doney, chief investment
officer for stocks at National Securities &amp; Research Corp.
The Greenwich, Conn., firm manages close to $2 billion in
mutual funds. Unless the Mideast crisis escalates, Mr. Doney
thinks it won't hurt stock prices much further. But he
"figured stocks were fully priced" this summer, and noted
that "earnings estimates are coming down."
   Alden Stewart, who runs the $1.5 billion growth-stock
account at Equitable Capital Management Corp. in New York,
said that if the Persian Gulf turmoil is resolved quickly,
"The market for growth stocks looks pretty good." But if the
U.S. gets bogged down for months in the region or if Iraq
escalates the conflict through terrorism, it's a different
story."
   In the six months that ended just before the invasion, the
contest's investment pros achieved a handsome return of
26.4%, clobbering a "dartboard portfolio" picked by a random
toss of darts at the stock listings. The dart stocks rose an
average of 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was
up 11.5%.
   Since the contest adopted new rules featuring a six-month
time frame, the pros have two wins and no losses against the
darts.
   For the coming six months, Mr. Falkner recommends Urcarco
Inc., a Fort Worth-based chain of used-car dealerships in
Texas. Urcarco offers financing to people who normally can't
get it -- often people with no credit cards or even checking
accounts -- at interest rates of 20% and up.
   There are plenty of loan defaults: So far, one car has
been repossessed for every four sold. Urcarco accumulates
reserves on the assumption that one of every three loans will
eventually default. Skeptics question whether even that is
enough. As time passes, and the economy worsens, they suspect
Urcarco will get into trouble. But Mr. Falkner thinks the
reserves will prove adequate. "They have revolutionized the
way you sell used cars," he said.
   Urcarco has come way down from its 12-month high of $23 a
share. It closed at $11.125 a share, up 12.5 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Mr. Falkner
recommends the stock at as much as $15.
   Ms. Fisher's new pick is AMR Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas,
parent of American Airlines. Financial woes at several major
carriers (notably Eastern, Pan Am and TWA) will soon force
distress sales of some weak airlines' assets, such as routes
and landing rights, she believes. "This is going to create
huge, permanent market-share gains" for the strong carriers.
Also, she said industry capacity will shrink because some of
the weaker carriers' planes "are clunkers; they're not coming
back."
   Now is a good time to buy AMR, she said, because "you're
technically oversold, you've had a round of negative surprise
earnings, people are worried about fuel price hikes, and you
{will be} coming off a lousy 1990 where costs were out of
control." She expects earnings of only $4 a share this year,
but $6.50 a share in 1991.
   At yesterday's closing price of $52 a share, up 75 cents,
on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR is selling below book
value, as Ms. Fisher calculates it. She would buy it at
prices as high as $62 and thinks the stock could hit $80
within six months.
   Mr. Doney, who manages two mutual funds (National Total
Income Fund and National Total Return Fund), likes American
Express Co. The big reason, he said, is the New York
company's successful charge-card business. He figures it is
growing 13% to 14% a year, with an attractive return on
equity of 25% to 26%.
   Things aren't too bad either at IDS, a large American
Express subsidiary that offers insurance, mutual funds and
financial planning. The albatross has been the Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage house unit, but Mr. Doney
thinks Shearson could break even this year.
   American Express closed at $26.625 a share, down 12.5
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Mr. Doney
recommends it at up to $32.
   Mr. Stewart, who runs the $1.5 billion growth-stock
account at Equitable Capital, plumps for McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., the nation's largest cellular telephone
company. He said he likes it even though "the company is
losing money and will continue to lose money on an
earnings-per-share basis for probably the next three years."
   McCaw, Kirkland, Wash., has cellular licenses (typically
duopolies, two per major city) in areas that include 40% of
the U.S. population, Mr. Stewart said. And "they are adding
subscribers at the rate of more than 50%" a year.
   McCaw's price has come down from a high of about $45 a
share; the Class A shares closed at $21.50, unchanged, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. Feeding the slide were
worries about competing technologies -- personal
communications networks and specialized mobile radio -- but
Mr. Stewart doesn't think they pose a threat to cellular. If
they do come into use in this country, he said, McCaw may use
them. He would buy McCaw at as much as $28 a share.
   In the coming six months, the pros' picks will compete
against a dartboard portfolio consisting of Affiliated
Publications Inc., ARX Inc., Bank of New England Corp. and
Nashua Corp.
