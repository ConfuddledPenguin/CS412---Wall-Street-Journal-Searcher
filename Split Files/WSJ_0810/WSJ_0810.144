   Government price cuts and intensifying competition in the
industry pushed down sales during the period, the company
said. The Ministry of Health and Welfare imposed an average
9.2% cut in retail drug prices at the beginning of April.
   Overall sales also were pushed down by a sharp drop in
sales of the Tokyo-based company's largest selling drug,
Picibanil, an injectable immunological cancer agent. Its
sales declined 60% following the government's decision in
December to restrict the range of cancers for which Picibanil
can be used and to allow its use only in conjunction with
other anti-cancer drugs.
