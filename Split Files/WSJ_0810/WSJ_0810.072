   APRIL 9: This is the happiest day of my life. I've been
promoted to our headquarters office in Tulsa]
   Of course, this means selling our house, which we bought
only three years ago. It shouldn't be too difficult. The
market is supposedly a little soft, but I have every
confidence we'll do fine. I believe that people will always
need good housing, which this is. I look forward with a
bright and hopeful heart to the realization of a full measure
of asset value. Everything comes to him or her who waits, and
we've got four full months to get this job done.

   Watch our smoke]
                                                                                                       

   APRIL 16: Our agent, Millie, has told us we have to be
"realistic" and "willing to make concessions." The market is
"very soft," she said. "You bought back in the mid-80s when
the banks were willing to lend money to anyone with a
checkbook and a dark suit, no offense," she said. "Times have
changed."
   I'm tempted to remind her what she told us when we bought
back in '87. "Don't worry about what seems like the
exorbitant asking price," she chirped back then. "You're
putting your money in the best and safest investment there is
-- the future]"
   But I hold my tongue. What's the point? None of this is
her fault. Is it?
                                                                                                       

   APRIL 23: A few couples looked at the house this week. The
Farbers, who "hate ecru." The Roztonkowskis, who would have
preferred wood chips and gravel to a grass lawn (for easy
maintenance). And two guys who called themselves the Broz
Brothers, who were disappointed to find no gym.
   Three couples in a week] This will be easier than Millie
thinks.
                                                                                                       

   MAY 23: Well, maybe not that easy. One visitor in the past
month: a tall, sinister individual with a fetid white coat
and vertical hair, with a companion who couldn't have been
more than three feet tall. "Ah yes, Fritz," the guy murmured
to his friend as they sat on my daughter's bed, stroking her
Little Mermaid sheets. "This should be a perfect spot for our
experiments]" I kicked them out. How desperate do they think
we are?
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 7: I had Millie call Fritz to see whether he was
still interested. Unfortunately, they just bought a house
down the street.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 20: At last] A genuine nibble] The Stimmels: a
boorish pair of ferrets in human form, although I have
nothing against them personally. I don't know whether
anything will come of this, but they've been here twice]
After looking over the entire residence, Mrs. Stimmel ("Call
me Dot") stood in thought on the front lawn and said, "Gee,
this would be a halfway decent spread if there was something
jazzing up the view." Eager to please, I asked, "Like what?"
   "Like maybe a lawn gnome or two," Mrs. Stimmel said. No
way, Dot.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 21: This evening I went to Kropotkin's hardware store
and picked up a brace of three-foot-high gnomes. Man, they're
ugly. When I got home, my wife said to me, "Dot called and
wonders whether it would be possible to do the gnomes in
pink, blue and electric orange." It's 3 a.m. now, and I'm
just finished with the spray painting. I can't write anymore.
I'm too exhausted.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 24: Dot and Merv came over last night. They like the
gnomes. We're circling the issue of money now. We've priced
ourselves ludicrously low and stand to break just about even
(if you don't count the $50,000 we put into the place over
the last couple of years).
   So Merv sat down in the kitchen and said to me, "How's
about a beer?" I repressed a strong desire to pop the big
rhino in the nose. I gave him the beer and had one myself.
"How's about another?" he said after a time. Seven beers
later, the guy leaned across the table, and I was seriously
concerned that his breath would ignite my favorite T-shirt.
"OK," he blurted. "Let's get down to brass tacks. We've got
80 grand in cash here that's got your name on it."
   I did not know what to make of this. Eighty grand is a
dimple on the face of our asking price] I left the kitchen,
honking and sobbing. "It's my allergy," I told him. "Give me
a moment and I'll be all right."
   Back in the living room, Millie was elated. "You have a
firm offer," she burbled. "If you make a few more minor
concessions, I'm sure they'll be willing to come up quite a
bit]"
   "Will they come up 500%?]" I screamed.
   The Stimmels departed, but not before recommending that if
we really want them to raise their offer, we might consider
making some additional gestures of commitment -- like new
plumbing, new wiring and a Florida room off the back patio.
It's Sunday, so I can't do anything about it today.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 25: I went down to Toyota and traded in my new MR2.
That should just about cover the remodeling Dot and Merv
suggest.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 15: The remodeling is done, but time is running out.
We have accepted the Stimmels' final offer of $80,006. My
attorney tells me that under the bankruptcy laws, I will
still be allotted enough money to move to Tulsa and make a
new start.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 20: The Stimmels refuse to go to contract until I
hand over all my frequent-flier miles and supply them with a
full year of meat. We agree.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 30: Closing is tomorrow, and the next day we move to
Tulsa. For a while it looked as though we were going to have
to walk, but some of our neighbors took up a collection and
physically restrained the Stimmels from laying hands on it.
   For the past couple of weeks we've been living in a tent
in the back yard, and I've been picking up a few extra
dollars running errands for Dot, bringing Merv a beer when he
needs one. The Stimmels insisted on moving in as soon as the
contracts were signed. "Just to get the feel of the place,"
Merv said. Millie told me such arrangements weren't that
unusual, given the "shifting nature of the marketplace."
                                                                                                       

   AUG. 1: We're on the bus. We're traveling light -- my wife
with her one cloth dress, I with my two suits, one sport
jacket and one pair of slacks. My daughter secreted a Barbie
under her smock, and I believe my son has at least one
Ghostbuster shoved in the waistband of his pants.
                                                                                                       

   AUG. 7: One week later -- and everything's peachy] Tulsa's
a wonderful city, the job's great, and living will be
terrific. My company has given me a small stipend to find
housing. It shouldn't be too tough: The neighborhood we're
looking at has 150 houses -- 70 of which are for sale. We saw
a perfect one today, in fact, owned by a real nice couple
named Willard and Bea. Well, not exactly perfect. It could
use a screened-in porch, perhaps, and a pool. Also, we hate
the color of the trim.
   Anyway, it's all negotiable. In the meantime, I think I'll
go see Willard. Maybe he has a couple of brews in the fridge.
