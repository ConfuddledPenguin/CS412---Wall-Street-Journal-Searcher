   LOS ANGELES -- Bell Industries Inc. said net income jumped
96% in the fourth quarter ended June 30 on the strength of
higher-margin sales and reduced overhead.
   The industrial products company's net totaled $2.9
million, or 49 cents a share, up from $1.5 million, or 25
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped 2.6% to $102.9
million from $105.7 million.

   Theodore Williams, chairman and president, said the Los
Angeles-based company is "confident that the pattern of
earnings improvement will extend into the new fiscal year."
   Bell said operating profit rose sharply in its two largest
business groups, electronics products and business products,
despite lower sales.
   However, operating profit declined in Bell's remaining
businesses, graphic arts and motor vehicle parts and
accessories, reflecting costs of restructuring the operations
and a change of facilities.
   For the fiscal year, net rose 80% to $8.2 million, or
$1.40 a share, from $4.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in
fiscal 1989. Sales fell 5.4% to $395.8 million from $418.2
million.
