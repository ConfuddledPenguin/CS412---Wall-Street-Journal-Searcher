   Nearly 400 commercial real-estate professionals were asked
to forecast annual real-estate appreciation through 1994. No
sector was predicted to even keep pace with inflation. The
main culprits: overbuilding, identified by nearly 90% as one
of the factors having the greatest impact on investment
performance, and economic recession, cited by 75%. Survey
respondents also named Houston as the single local market
with the most investment potential. The most overvalued
market: New York City.

                      Boomers and Bust
                                                                                                       

   Demographics have clearly been on housing's side. No
longer. During the '70s and '80s, house-hungry baby boomers
pushed consruction -- and prices -- to astronomical levels.
The boomers are still hungry, and they're eager to shed their
old homes and buy new, bigger ones. There's only one problem:
The baby bust is coming up behind them, and there aren't
enough busters to buy the boomers' homes. That's going to put
a crimp on new-home construction. But the constructoin
industry isn't despairing entirely. If homeowners can't sell
and trade up, they do have an alternative: remodeling. The
National Association of Home Builders foreasts that by the
end of the decade, additions and alterations to existing
homes will rise to about one-third ofconstruction activity
from about one-fourth currently. "The trade-up is going to
happen," says David Seiders, chief economist of the home
builders' group. "It's just going to take a different form."
