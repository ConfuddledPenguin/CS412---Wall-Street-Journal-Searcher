17.27 billion yen a year earlier.

   Net income increased as the company's corporate and
residential tax burden slipped to 5.66 billion yen from 8.11
billion yen a year earlier. Sales edged up 1.5% to 265.25
billion yen from 261.32 billion yen.
   A Showa Denko official said the company was hurt by rising
naphtha prices. He also cited rising research and development
costs for dragging down pretax profit.
   Sales in the petrochemical category, accounting for 46% of
overall sales, rose 3.4% to 122.1 billion yen from 118.07
billion yen. Sales of ceramics, aluminium and other products,
accounting for 35% of total sales, totaled 93.88 billion yen,
a 1.8% slip from 95.55 billion yen.
   The company plans to pay a mid-term dividend of 3 yen,
compared with 2.5 yen a year earlier.
   For the year, the company sees sales rising to 530 billion
yen from 525.47 billion yen. Pretax profit is expected to be
30 billion yen with net at 15 billion yen.
