   Exaggerated concerns about real estate weakness in New
England have created buying opportunities in the shares of
some of the region's largest banking companies. We recommend
purchase of Bank of New England and Shawmut National.
   -- Dec. 7, 1988, recommendation by David S. Berry, vice
president, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.

   If not quite a day of infamy for Mr. Berry, that
particular Dec. 7 certainly was not one of his better ones.
Bank of New England rewarded his confidence by losing $1.1
billion in the ensuing year because of rotten real-estate
loans. Shawmut lost $128 million. The stocks of both
companies plunged.
   About the only comfort the hapless forecaster could take
was in the knowledge that he had lots and lots of company:
Few people foresaw the size and the extent of the real-estate
bust. In terms of total losses for commercial and residential
developers, and for their investors and lenders, the 1980s
were the worst decade since the Great Depression.
   But what about the 1990s?
   Don't hold your breath waiting for a turnaround. The
real-estate business isn't going to get much better -- at
least through the first half of the decade. Despite the
losses in the '80s, builders kept building and lenders kept
lending. Now, both property values and construction activity
are going to be depressed by two legacies of the decade -- a
widespread credit crunch and a huge overhang of repossessed
or troubled real estate.
   The credit crunch will eventually promote recovery by
limiting new building. But in the meantime it will thin the
ranks of potential buyers, thus keeping prices depressed. And
the overhang of distressed properties will continue to glut
the market for years, further keeping a lid on values. Both
the federal government and private lenders have already begun
a race to the auction block, and sales of many of their
white-elephant properties are being made at discounts of from
25% to 75% of their construction cost.
   Looking at all this, a real-estate industry often noted
for unwarranted optimism now is glum. A May survey of 400
real-estate executives by Ernst &amp; Young produced a consensus
that the depression in commercial real estate will continue
for five more years. And the National Association of Home
Builders recently pared its estimate of 1990 housing starts
to 1.28 million units, down from 1.81 million in 1986, the
peak year of the decade. The estimate rivals actual
construction in 1982, when home building reached its postwar
nadir.
   In certain hard-hit parts of the country, home prices have
fallen 25% or more in the past five years. Even California
has not been immune; the statewide median home price has
slipped 3% from a year ago, the first such year-to-year
decline in five years.
   "It's extremely difficult to obtain financing for any kind
of housing construction even if it's a gold-plated deal,"
says Houston builder Martin Perlman, president of the
National Association of Home Builders. He says the estimate
of housing starts for 1990, already at an eight-year low,
could be trimmed further.
   There will, of course, be some profit opportunities in the
continuing depression. Investors with iron guts and full
wallets will be able to pick up properties at fire-sale
prices. Strong lenders will expand their market share as
hard-hit rivals disintegrate or pull back. But there will be
many more losers than winners, and the biggest loser by any
measure will be Uncle Sam -- which is to say, all taxpayers.
   The taxpayer share of the total cost of the the savings
and loan bailout, prompted mainly by the collapse of the
real-estate market, will range from $340 billion to $440
billion in the 1990s, according to the most comprehensive
analysis to date, by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. in
Austin, Texas. Read our lips: That is a liability of at least
$1,400 for every man, woman and child in the U.S.
   Though he's no Donald Trump, not long ago the big names of
New England real-estate finance clamored to press money on
Howard Fafard. "They'd stand in line to offer me a lower
rate," recalls the Milford, Mass., developer. "They were
fighting for business."
   This past April, however, one of his lenders decided to
give him the business. Pressured by federal bank examiners to
reduce the number of its real-estate loans, Bank of Boston
shut down his revolving credit line. When other previously
eager lenders declined to come to his rescue, the 30-year-old
Fafard Cos. landed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Which, more or less, is the fate of a growing number of
real-estate developers these days. The gusher of cash that
watered the industry -- and that led to gross overbuilding
and the ensuing collapse of much of the S&amp;L industry -- now
has been largely shut off at the spigot by frightened lenders
and their regulators. The decadelong lending binge for
construction of homes, hotels, shopping centers, apartment
projects and office buildings clearly is over.
   Over the last six months, growth in construction loans
held by banks has come to a virtual halt, according to
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Among thrifts,
meanwhile, construction loans plunged 22% in the first
quarter from the year-earlier period. A Federal Reserve
survey in May found that about 80% of the nation's banks had
tightened their real-estate lending standards.
   The pullback by the banks is particularly important. In
the gaudier days of the boom, they were only one financing
source; the S&amp;Ls were pouring cash into the business, and a
small army of syndicators were doing the same, with money
raised from investors in private and public offerings.
Insurance companies stepped up their lending, too.
   Now, much of the S&amp;L industry is either defunct or
fighting for survival, and the syndicators have either been
blown away by tax-law changes in 1986 or run into the ground
by shabby performance. No new money there. Insurers, turned
on to real estate in the '80s, are now turning off. "We don't
see anything that would cause us to want to spend any more
time or energy" in commercial property, says Gordon Oakes
Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Monarch Capital
Corp. in Springfield, Mass. The insurance firm recently set
aside a $72 million reserve to cover losses from a planned
three-year commercial-property sale.
   So, in many regions, actual and prospective borrowers have
been looking to the banks to fill the financing gap. They
have been disappointed, and they will continue to be
disappointed. The banks, suffering large exposures from bum
real-estate loans of their own, are a lot less interested in
helping the industry out of a hole than they are in saving
their own skins. And even if they were so inclined, their
regulators might not let them.
   The banks can hardly be blamed for slamming down the
credit window for a while. Between 1982 and 1989, they and
their S&amp;L brethren lost a combined $75 billion on bad
real-estate loans. Among bank credit problems, real estate is
"public enemy No. 1," says one expert in bank securities.
   Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, estimates that as
many as 15% of its commercial real-estate loans, which total
$12.6 billion, could be in trouble by year end. The figure
could run even higher after a coming audit by Federal bank
examiners; in recent months they have been especially
merciless in forcing banks to reclassify many of their
real-estate loans as problem loans.
   Which means, in effect, that it is hard to find anybody
willing to put up front money. "Every previous boom-and-bust
cycle in Arizona has ended because financing came in. What's
different about this one is that the S&amp;Ls have been blown
out, and the banks are paralyzed," says Edward Carson,
chairman and chief executive officer of First Interstate
Bancorp in Los Angeles, which has major real-estate loan
liabilities in Arizona and several other states.
   "Liquidity available to the real-estate industry appears
to be at its lowest point since the end of World War II,"
says Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer of Lomas
Financial Corp. in Dallas. He ought to know. The
financial-services and real-estate concern filed its own
bankruptcy-law petition last fall, and this past March took a
$505 million special charge, indicating that, like many, it
is still exploring the depth of its own real-estate problems.
   Most of the biggest developers in the business say that
they have been able to survive the credit crunch so far, but
a continuing drought of cash would change that. The legion of
small builders, heavily dependent on up-front loans from
banks and S&amp;Ls, are already in deep trouble, and some larger
firms are joining them. Projects are being abandoned or
scaled back from coast to coast. "Everybody today has been
humbled," says Samuel Alpert, executive vice president of
Oliver Group Inc. in Shawnee-Mission, Kan., a developer of
multifamily housing that isn't doing much developing these
days.
   A growing minority of industry observers are now seriously
concerned that the credit crunch may nudge the whole national
economy into recession. "Liquidity was probably way too loose
before, but now it is too tight," says Dennis Jacobe,
research director for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions. "I would argue that it will bring a recession."
   Total returns on prime commercial space over the past year
were less than the comparable rate on a U.S. Treasury bill,
according to Frank Russell Co., a Tacoma, Wash., real-estate
adviser to institutional investors. Says Blake Eagle,
president of the Frank Russell real-estate-consulting group:
"Rhetorically, one has to ask, `Why would I invest in real
estate when returns on T-bills are higher?' That is being
asked on a lot of different fronts."
   Realizing this, a good part of the industry has simply
gone to sleep. "A lot of lenders, buyers and developers have
crawled in a hole and zipped up the cover," says Jack
Hancock, executive vice president of the real-estate
industries group at Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles.
   From a broader perspective, the bust is a correction that
was long overdue; though the picture varies from region to
region, taken as a whole the current glut of commercial
office space is so great that the nation would be adequately
served even if no new building took place for five or even 10
years.
   Making matters worse, if possible, is some $60 billion in
foreclosed real estate and about $68 billion in delinquent
real estate held by banks, by thrifts and -- courtesy of the
S&amp;L debacle -- by Uncle Sam, who now reluctantly runs the
nation's largest real-estate operation. Each of these
entities wants to put its real-estate problems behind it, and
fast. Each is afraid that the others -- particularly the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal holding tank for
properties of failed institutions -- will throw so much
property on the market that prices will collapse.
   And so all of them are rushing to the auction block, with
predictable results: Property is being dumped pell-mell on
already-depressed markets, and prices are indeed cut-rate.
(Another complication: The lenders and their regulators are
shooting themselves in the foot. Their tightened credit
policies are reducing the number of eligible bidders, hurting
prices even more.)
   The banks got in early. First Interstate's Texas banking
unit, for example, sold $450 million in foreclosed property
and related assets last year. It hopes to sell at least $750
million more this year, but it is fearful about the
prospective impact of big RTC sales that have just begun.
   "Nobody knows the full impact of {the RTC sales}. There is
always a chance of a regional or national recession, and
given that the portfolio was the size it was, we needed to
move it faster," says Allen Brown, executive vice president
of the First Interstate unit. "I think everybody will come
around to doing it this way. There is just too much property
to be moved."
   Yet another depressant for the market: Many relatively
healthy thrifts are also being forced to sell real estate, a
consequence of the bailout law that Congress passed last
year.
   The law requires S&amp;Ls to raise extra capital to back any
direct investments they might have in real estate; since
capital is nearly impossible for most to raise these days,
they are being forced to sell the property instead. At the
same time, the same law strictly limits the amount of
financing thrifts can offer on such sales -- which some
executives say will greatly reduce the level of bidding.
   Oak Tree Savings Bank, a New Orleans thrift, is having to
sell properties with a book value of $1.08 billion. It
thought it had found a buyer for $517 million of the property
this spring -- but the deal collapsed when the only party
interested in financing the transaction was Oak Tree itself,
which couldn't do it.
   "We have a fire-sale sign around our neck and a gun to our
head. We have no chance of getting a fair price," says Gerald
Barton, chairman and chief executive officer of Landmark Land
Co. in Carmel, Calif., which owns Oak Tree Savings.
   Some real-estate experts suspect that the insurance
industry will be the next to get clobbered by defaults and
foreclosures. David Shulman, a Salomon Brothers analyst, says
1991 will be the testing time. That's when a huge amount of
five-year commercial mortgages come due that were issued in
the record lending year of 1986.
   "Property values are declining, in many cases to levels
below their mortgage balance," he notes. This, he expects,
will lead borrowers to exercise an option built into every
nonrecourse mortgage loan -- the right to hand the building
back to the lender in satisfaction of the current principal
balance of the loan. With this option becoming ever more
attractive as property values fall, Mr. Shulman expects
mortgage foreclosure rates for insurers to double by 1993 to
2.4% from the current 1.1%.
   Given all this, it's no wonder the real-estate industry is
a little short on optimism. But it's an ill wind indeed that
doesn't blow somebody some good, and amid all the worry over
the bust there are some happy faces to be seen. About 3,000
of them belong to the members of the Happy Church of Denver,
which in March found a new home for its evangelical ministry
in the Beau Monde Shopping Center outside town. The Beau
Monde cost about $30 million to build. Its developer and the
S&amp;L that financed it both went belly up, and the church
walked away with it for $7.8 million.
   "When we first heard about it, we thought it was much too
expensive. But over a period of months, the price seemed to
come down to a more realistic realm for us," says Karen
Cutler, a church official. "Certainly, the Lord blessed us
with a wonderful facility."
