   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said it will cost as much as $200
million before taxes to shrink its stumbling Philipp Brothers
Inc. commodity unit.
   The charge is likely to be taken this quarter and could
wipe out much of Salomon's third-quarter earnings. It would
be Salomon's largest charge against earnings since it went
public in 1981, and would represent the latest in a string of
big restructuring hits taken by Wall Street securities firms
in the past year.

   Salomon, as previously reported, plans to sharply cut back
the scope of Philipp Brothers, which late last month posted a
pretax loss of $62 million -- its sixth consecutive quarterly
deficit. Through June, the unit has had $83 million in losses
this year.
   In a brief news release, Salomon said it started a program
for "a major downsizing and repositioning" of Philipp,
stemming from "prolonged difficult market conditions and
trading losses." The firm declined to elaborate.
   But people familiar with Philipp Brothers' plans say it
will get out of agricultural and non-ferrous metals trading
altogether, and shift its precious-metals trading to its
Phibro Energy Inc. unit. For the past several years, Salomon
has cut back to trading only a handful of commodities from
approximately 150 previously.
   Shifting the residue of Philipp would mark a full circle
for the struggling commodities unit: Philipp Brothers
initially was part of Phibro Corp., which acquired Salomon
Brothers in 1981. Today, Salomon Brothers is the securities
unit of Salomon Inc.
   Salomon said Ernst Weil, Phibro Energy chairman and a
Salomon director, will oversee the Philipp "downsizing."
Phibro Energy is Salomon's profitable oil trading and
refining unit.
   Analysts expect Salomon to pare the unit and take the
charge this quarter. "It's like appendicitis," said Perrin
Long, senior securities analyst for Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "You have it operated on as soon as
possible. You might as well take your hit at once."
   Citing the firm's earlier exit from the institutional
municipal bond business and commercial paper operations, Mr.
Long said: "Salomon doesn't like to carry losing operations
indefinitely."
   There's another good reason for taking the charge in the
current quarter: Salomon's Phibro Energy unit is probably
making a bundle on the recent surge in oil prices, traders
and analysts say. That will make any charge less painful and
less obvious.
   Traders say Philipp already has begun liquidating
positions in some commodities, including sugar and cocoa
futures. That's helped fuel declines in those commodities in
recent weeks, they say.
   Philipp recently has stumbled in a variety of commodities.
Last year, the firm took big hits in cocoa trading. The 1990
first quarter loss stemmed from trading in non-ferrous
metals, a group that includes copper, aluminum, nickel, tin
and zinc. In the second quarter, the losses came from
agricultural commodities.
