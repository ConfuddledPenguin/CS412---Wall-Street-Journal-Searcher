   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices ended mixed as late
profit-taking trimmed strong early advances.
   Only the nearest months ended with gains, though all
traded contracts set life-of-contract highs before sagging.

   August delivery copper settled at $1.3250 a pound, up 1.50
cents for the day, after trading as high as $1.3420.
September, the most active contract, was up 1.10 cents to
$1.3205. Meanwhile, December was unchanged at $1.2295, and
deliveries from January onward fell by amounts ranging from
0.10 cent to 0.50 cent a pound.
   John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp; Associates, a New
City, N.Y., copper industry consulting firm, said the roots
of the copper market's current behavior go back to June, when
traders and the industry generally were looking for slower
consumption, lower prices and a typical summer slowdown.
"Short-selling was induced by the negative sentiment" back
then, he said, and copper consumers held back on buying in
expectation of lower prices.
   During late June and in July, a "counterseasonal" rally
developed, Mr. Gross said, triggered by threats of a miners'
strike in Peru and problems in Chile, the world's leading
producer. Workers at Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper
company, staged a slowdown in a labor dispute, and there was
a rock burst at one of Codelco's large mines, El Teniente.
   These developments stimulated some demand for futures
contracts, which in turn triggered further buying on
technical considerations as prices rose, according to Mr.
Gross.
   "From that point on, the buying can really be considered
an extension of that technical demand, since no new
fundamental factors have appeared," he said.
   There is a widespread perception that demand for copper is
strong in Japan and Germany, Mr. Gross said. "If that is
true, why is it that stocks of copper in London Metal
Exchange warehouses continue to rise?" he asked.
   Those inventories have more than doubled since July 1 to
107,775 tons, he said. "This is a confusing element in an
otherwise strong fundamental picture," he said. "A case can
be made that Europe is on vacation, but that wouldn't account
for a stocks increase of that size."
   Now, Mr. Gross said, with New York futures prices
establishing new highs daily, if they rise above yesterday's
closings in a "meaningful" way, "they could continue to
advance."
   Another price-supporting factor, Mr. Gross said, is that
the supply of copper in Commodity Exchange warehouses is less
than would be needed to satisfy all August futures contracts
outstanding. Exchange inventories of copper amounted to 7,798
tons yesterday, and there were 881 August contracts
outstanding for a total of 11,013 tons. Most futures
contracts are nullified by an offsetting trade before they
mature.
   "You can't rule out continued strength in the August
contract based on concern over the supply delivery situation
on the Comex," Mr. Gross said.
   There also has been short-covering -- or the buying back
of contracts by traders who previously sold short in
anticipation of a price decline -- as well as options-related
buying of futures, another analyst said. The markets were
also bolstered by Japanese buying of copper early in the day,
he said, as well as by falling oil prices and a stronger
stock market.
   This analyst also said the Middle East situation was less
tense than on Wednesday, "although it can blow up at any
minute."
   Fundamentally, nothing has really changed in the past five
weeks, one dealer said, but the market continues to make new
highs. Consequently, all the answers as to where prices are
going seem to be based on technical considerations, he said.
   "All technicians are saying that the market will continue
to rise based on chart formations," he said, referring to
pricechart patterns that some traders use to foretell market
moves. This is an important assessment, he said, because most
of the gains recently have been spurred by technically
oriented traders, not by those whose trading is based on
fundamental factors.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for cattle futures deliverable
this month rose on a pick-up in wholesale demand. But an
increase in private analysts' estimates of the number of
cattle put on feedlots in July depressed prices for futures
contracts deliverable next year. August live cattle futures
gained 0.77 cent a pound to close at 78.77 cents. Next
Friday, the Agriculture Department will release its estimates
of the number of cattle on feedlots as of Aug. 1. Charles
Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago, said he expects the figures to show at least a 5%
increase. Cattle are placed on feedlots to be fattened in
preparation for marketing. With traders reacting to an
expected increase in supplies coming off the feedlots and
into the market early next year, February live cattle futures
dropped 0.27 cent a pound to close at 76.52 cents.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher. December
delivery gold was up $2.60 an ounce to $394.80. September
silver advanced 1.3 cents an ounce to $4.8830. October
platinum ended with a gain of $4.80 at $486.90. Dinsa Mehta,
chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, said one reason
that gold has shown strength over the past week and has
resisted significant declines is "a reluctance of traders to
hold short positions." A short sale is a sale made in
anticipation of declining prices. At the moment, there is
clear justification for the gold market to hold in the
$380-an-ounce range, he said, and there is no indication that
the market is going to "run away and shoot up to $400."
Although the market's principal support is coming from the
Mideast crisis, any drop in oil shipments from that area can
be made up elsewhere, and this is restraining the buying of
gold, according to Mr. Mehta. Moreover, he said, the
situation could turn into an impasse, which would diffuse the
tension. "In that case, gold prices could drift lower," he
said. Bruce Kaplan, president of Kaplan Co., a Santa Monica,
Calif., precious metals consulting firm, said the advance in
platinum was "mostly a correction" to bring the price into a
"realistic alignment" with gold. Platinum usually trades at
about $100 an ounce above gold, he said, but recently that
differential had narrowed.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices eased. The September contract ended
with a loss of $9 a metric ton at $1,120. Traders focused on
reports of improved weather in the Ivory Coast, the world's
largest producer, an analyst said. There has been some rain
recently, and the pod count has looked good despite earlier
dry weather. A further supply build-up is expected from the
1990-91 crop, while demand, particularly from Eastern
European countries that were good buyers last year, may
decline because of financial problems, the analyst said. en
