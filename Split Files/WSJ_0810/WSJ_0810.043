   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. announced it will build
a $90 million plant in New Bedford, Mass., to manufacture
advanced films for the company's new electronic imaging
products.
   The new, 250,000 square foot manufacturing facility,
expected to be in operation by late 1992, will employ more
than 100 people in producing a "wide range of new products,
including advanced film for our new laser-based medical
diagnostic imaging system known as Helios," said I.
MacAllister Booth, Polaroid president and chief executive
officer.

   The first product in its Helios line will be a specialized
laser printer for use with ultrasound and nuclear medicine
scanners. The printer will make hard-copy images for
examination within 90 seconds, the company said. Currently,
such images take up to 20 minutes to develop.
   Polaroid said its Helios line is aimed initially at
seizing a piece of the $3 billion world-wide annual market
for medical-imaging film. The products will target the
approximately 25% of the market devoted to film used with
electronic and computerized imaging systems, such as
ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scanners.
Future Helios products will be aimed at graphic arts
applications and scientific uses, such as seismic imaging.
   Polaroid has suffered from steadily weakening sales since
the decline of the instant photography market in the 1970s.
