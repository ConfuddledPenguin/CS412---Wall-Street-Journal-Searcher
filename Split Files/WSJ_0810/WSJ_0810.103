   GTI Corp. said it plans to sell 2.5 million new shares of
GTI common stock for $7.5 million to London-based Telemetrix
PLC, its largest holder.
   The proposed sale would boost Telemetrix's holdings in the
San Diego-based maker of electronic circuit boards to 65.4%,
from a current 52.8%.

   Proceeds from the sale would be used to finance part of
GTI's proposed purchase of about 90% of Valor Electronics
Co., a San Diego-based maker of electronic components, for
about $18.5 million in cash and debt.
   GTI said shareholders will be asked to approve the sale of
stock to Telemetrix at an Aug. 28 special meeting.
