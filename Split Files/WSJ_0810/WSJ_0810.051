   NEW YORK -- Senior U.S. executives favor extensive action
by government and business to tackle what they see as
worrisome social problems, according to a poll done for
Seagram &amp; Co.
   The Chivas Regal Report on American Business Leaders found
that 54% of the 251 senior executives surveyed favored
requiring national public service. The executives said that
both men and women should be offered the choice between
military and civilian service. People might then be assigned
to help in public schools, work with the homeless or assist
in hospitals or drug-treatment programs. Many executives said
the Peace Corps could serve as a model.

   Nearly two-thirds of the executives said companies should
let employees take days off with pay to perform community
service. An average of four days a year was recommended.
   Some 80% of the executives said they would support
additional personal or corporate taxes if the funds could be
targeted at solving specific problems. They were especially
concerned about problems in public schools and about the
federal deficit, even ahead of drugs, health care and the
environment.
   "A lot of people seem to be saying that if we don't deal
with some of these problems it'll lead to a gradual
unraveling of our society," said Nick Tortorello, chairman of
Research &amp; Forecasts Inc., a New York-based polling firm that
conducted the survey.
   The survey also found that 76% of the executives favored
cutting defense spending by an average of 19%, with the
savings going to help finance some of the social problems.
The survey was taken in April, however, and the Middle East
crisis has presumably moderated the interest in cutting
defense spending, at least for the time being.
   The executives expressed concern about the government's
inability to reduce the federal budget deficit and said they
thought the U.S. will suffer from a lack of political
leadership.
   They were generally optimistic about the economy, saying
in April that they didn't expect a recession in the following
12 months. At the same time, they didn't expect unemployment
to decline or inflation to ease.
   In addition, those concerns appear to have been
exacerbated by the Middle East crisis, according to a
supplementary survey that Research &amp; Forecasts did this week
with roughly 100 of the executives. The survey found that 39%
expected to lower their profit projections following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Some 12% expected to reduce their
borrowing; 10% planned to delay expansion; and 8% predicted a
hiring freeze. Given the smaller sample, the margin for error
in the recent survey is 10 percentage points, compared with
six percentage points in the main study.
   In the April survey, the executives complained about the
Internal Revenue Service even more than might be expected of
people in high tax brackets.
   "Inadequately monitored, administering an overly complex
tax code that its own bureaucracy cannot explain accurately
and clearly, following quasi-legal procedures that appear to
be stacked against the citizen, the agency is seen as unfair,
punitive and inefficient," the Chivas Regal report said.
   The executives generally felt that government involvement
in business affairs would increase, with more states
restricting acquisitions. The survey also found that
executives expected that pension funds would take more seats
on corporate boards, even though the executives felt the
involvement would hinder companies more than it would help
them.
