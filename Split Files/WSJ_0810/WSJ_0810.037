   Unsettled markets prompted investors to move out of stocks
and bonds and place their money in money-market funds. "This
is the largest single week's increase since Jan. 10," said
Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute.
   Mutual funds' assets were revised for the previous week,
to $395.91 billion. The increase reported for the Aug. 1 week
was revised to $1.3 billion.
