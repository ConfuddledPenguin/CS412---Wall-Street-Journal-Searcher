   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it will
postpone work on a new luxury car to throw more resources
behind new midsized models it desperately needs.
   The change reflects not only Chrysler's weakness in the
middle of its product lineup, but also its limited ability to
handle development of several new products at once.

   Company officials said the delay of the large, rear-drive
models resulted from low volume targets for the luxury cars,
codenamed LX; Chrysler's pressing need to bolster its
mainstream products, and concerns over the potential for
higher fuel-economy restrictions. However, the decision
apparently was made before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the
subsequent oil-price shock.
   G. Glenn Gardner, Chrysler's general manager for new
platform engineering, said at an industry conference here
that the company lacked the manpower to develop
simultaneously the luxury models and the two middle-market
cars.
   However, Chrysler spokesmen insisted that the auto maker
isn't reducing its plans to spend $15 billion on products
over five years. They said Chrysler will simply shift more
emphasis behind the midsized car programs.
   The first of the new midsized cars will be the models
currently code-named LH. Company officials and analysts say
the LH cars will be as critical to Chrysler's future in the
1990s as the compact K-cars were in the 1980s.
   That's because the LH car chassis is the first all-new,
midpriced car design Chrysler has developed since the K car.
The K-car chassis still is the building block for most of
Chrysler's current models, including its popular minivans.
   Chrysler plans to start building the first LH cars in 1992
after closing the Bramalea, Ontario, plant that will make
them for 16 weeks of preparation, Mr. Gardner said. The cars
will be sold in the 1993 model year through Dodge, Chrysler
and Jeep/Eagle dealers.
   The auto maker had planned to follow the LH models with
the rear-wheel drive LX cars.
   Chrysler isn't canceling the LX, but is "readjusting the
timing of the car's development," Mr. Gardner said. Analysts
said the LX platform won't come out before the 1996 model
year.
   Instead, Chrysler will step up efforts to consolidate the
chassis for the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim and the
chassis for the Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible into
one common midsized chassis, or platform. Mr. Gardner said
the new midsized cars built on this platform will reach the
market by 1994.
   Privately, Chrysler officials say the new cars can't come
soon enough. The Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco that the LH
models are scheduled to supplant have never sold well enough
to compete with Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus and Sable models. The
Spirit and Acclaim have been among the company's most popular
cars, but haven't achieved the volume of the similarly sized
Honda Accord.
   Analysts said the decision to delay the luxury car in
favor of the midsized models is a positive step.
   "Given Chrysler's current financial situation, it didn't
seem reasonable that the company could bring all of those
products to fruition at the same time," said Christopher
Cedergren, an analyst with J.D. Power &amp; Associates Inc., an
Agoura Hills, Calif., research and marketing firm. "Now
Chrysler's trying to better utilize its capital."
