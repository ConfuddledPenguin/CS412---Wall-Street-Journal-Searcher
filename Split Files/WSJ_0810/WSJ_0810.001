   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- IG Laboratories said it licensed
exclusively an experimental technology that promises to
enable fetal testing through a simple blood test rather than
amniocentesis, a procedure that poses a risk of miscarriage.
   The technology covered by the agreement was developed at
Boston's Children's Medical Center by Diana Bianchi and other
researchers, the company said. The technology involves
isolating fetal red blood cells from maternal blood. Last
year, Dr. Bianchi and colleagues reported that they had been
able to determine a fetus's sex by isolating such cells and
examining DNA contained in them.

   The technology, which will be jointly developed by IG
Laboratories and Dr. Bianchi's laboratory, promises to
broaden fetal screening for genetic defects, the company
said. A spokesman for IG Laboratories said that genetic
testing based on the technology might be commercially
available within three years. However, the technique is in
the early stages of development and hasn't been proved
practical for widespread screening. Moreover, use of the
potential test is likely to be controversial, given that it
might increase the number of abortions.
   Amniocentesis, which is now often used for genetic
screening of fetuses, involves withdrawing fluid from the
womb with a long needle -- a process that carries a small but
significant risk of inducing a miscarriage. The risk is
generally considered too high except for pregnant women --
mainly those over 35 -- who are at elevated risk for bearing
children with genetic diseases. However, more than 80% of
infants with Down's syndrome, a common genetic disorder that
causes mental retardation, are borne by women under 35, the
company noted. With the new technology, such cases might be
detected early without posing a risk of miscarriage.
   IG Laboratories is a 56%-owned unit of Genzyme Corp., a
Boston-based maker of biomedical products that publicly sold
a stake in the unit earlier this year.
