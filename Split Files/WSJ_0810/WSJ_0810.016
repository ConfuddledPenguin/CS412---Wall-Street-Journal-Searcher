   LONDON -- A cost-cutting campaign at British
Telecommunications PLC began to pay off in the fiscal first
quarter, as the main phone company reported a brisk 17% rise
in pretax profit.
   The pretax increase, to #741 million ($1.4 billion) from
#635 million a year earlier, came despite a sluggish British
economy and slower growth in telephone revenues. But the
company's labor and pension costs grew at a slower pace --
suggesting to analysts that the bureaucratic phone giant is
at last managing to control its costs.

   "The company's actually doing well at holding down costs,"
said London-based analyst Richard Ryder of Salomon Brothers
Inc. He and other London analysts interpreted the
first-quarter numbers as a sign that the company's profit
this year may suffer only minimally from the rocky British
economic conditions. Reflecting that sentiment, British
Telecom's stock price rose five pence a share to 292 pence
late Thursday on London's stock exchange.
   Since its 1984 privatization, the former state phone
monopoly has been criticized for having too many workers, too
much bureaucracy and inadequate service. Earlier this year,
though, tough-minded Chairman Iain Vallance announced a
sweeping reorganization -- eliminating management layers,
reshaping divisions, and planning annual job cuts of about
10,000 employees, or 4% of the current total, for at least
two years.
   The plan, though criticized by unions as too severe, was
welcomed in London's financial circles as needed preparation
for the 1990s. This winter, the British government is
expected to reduce regulation and allow more competition in
the phone market. With its current high costs, British
Telecom would be vulnerable to any new, leaner competitors.
Chief among these, analysts say, will be the U.S. regional
phone companies. In recent months, they have been investing
in British cable-television networks, in hopes of using them
to provide phone service in competition with British Telecom.
   Judging by the first-quarter results released yesterday,
the reorganization is beginning to work. Net profit for the
quarter ended June 30 rose 19%, to #493 million, or eight
pence a share, from #413 million, or 6.8 pence a share, a
year earlier. By contrast, because of the sluggish U.K.
economy, revenue rose only 9.6% to #3.21 billion from #2.93
billion. The company's operating profit margin widened to 27%
from 25% a year earlier.
   In a telephone interview, Financial Director Barry Romeril
said the company's staff costs rose just 2.6% in the quarter.
Much of that slow growth stemmed from a #50 million drop in
British Telecom's contributions to its employee pension fund;
last year, the company began trimming its contributions on
the basis of revised actuarial estimates. In addition, Mr.
Romeril said, the 2,300-person drop in the U.K. work force
during the quarter helped to hold down costs. After adjusting
for the pension savings and other factors, he said, the
company's underlying staff costs rose by 6% to 6.5% -- well
below Britain's near-10% inflation rate.
   Mr. Romeril said "the management is certainly going to
carry on" with its cost-cutting program in succeeding months.
He added, however, that "we can't determine what will happen
in terms of growth" in revenue this year; he said the outlook
is clouded by the uncertain British economy. "This is a soft
economy, and we can't be immune" to it, he said.
Historically, growth in telephone company revenues slows
during economic downturns, as businesses cut back on
telephone calling.
   For the 12 months ended June 30, the company said its
domestic call volume rose by 9%, slower than the 10% growth
in the 12 months ended March 31. Similarly, international
call volume grew by 12%, compared with 13% in the earlier
period.
