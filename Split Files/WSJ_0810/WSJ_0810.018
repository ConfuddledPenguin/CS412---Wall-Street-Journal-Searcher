   NEW YORK -- Conflict between employers' need for
information and employees' privacy rights is growing and is
the subject of increasing judicial and legislative scrutiny,
a Conference Board survey found.
   Surveying nearly 400 companies in the U.S., Canada and
Europe, the Conference Board found that more than 80% of the
respondents said that requesting more information from
prospective workers helps avoid the need for more-intrusive
measures, such as electronic surveillance, to ensure
workplace security.

   But information-gathering options are being reviewed
carefully by the courts and elected representatives.
Polygraphs used to be "one way to get information. They are
no longer allowed in all but a few situations," says Ronald
E. Berenbeim, author of the study at the nonprofit research
group. Also, "a certain amount of opposition and concern"
about psychological testing is developing, the analyst says.
   Among potentially sensitive subjects, a substantial
proportion of companies said they needed more information
than they did five years ago about employee health, but not
about age and marital status, criminal record, personal
financial status, or outside activities.
   Two-thirds of the U.S. participants said a lack of health
data had impeded their efforts to control health-care costs.
More than a third of U.S. companies did say they needed more
data about criminal records, but such need isn't shared by
the Canadian and European participants, the survey says.
   Nearly half the participants limit an immediate
supervisor's access to data about subordinates; almost all
the companies restrict managers from reviewing information
about employees who don't work for them, the report says.
   And three-quarters of the respondents said they wouldn't
divulge any data other than salary to prospective employers.
   The report showed a sharp divergence of opinion regarding
psychological tests, with 70% of non-U.S. companies calling
them useful and just 47% of the U.S. companies agreeing.
Those U.S. companies that disagreed called such tests
inappropriate for their work forces and said they could cause
litigation.
   More than two-thirds of the participants said searches and
surveillance are ineffective, hurting morale, going against
company philosophy, and -- again -- potentially dragging a
company into a lawsuit.
   Nonetheless, "such practices are fairly widespread,
particularly" in the U.S., the survey says. Some 15% of the
companies monitor use of phones and computers to determine
whether they are being used for nonbusiness purposes. And a
majority of participants in all three regions will search a
worker's locker, desk or office.
   As for off-duty conduct, "Company intrusions or
restrictions on intimate employee behavior are rare," the
report says. And when an employee doesn't disclose his
relationship to his or her company, bans on outside political
activity also are "infrequent," the survey found.
   The survey recommends certain policies and practices
regarding employee privacy. These include establishing
written criteria for the personnel data the company collects;
giving employees the right to see their files and to
challenge inaccuracies; and limiting the access that
employees' immediate managers and other supervisors have to
those files.
   Among other things, the report also suggests that
companies should give workers' copies of written requests for
information and, except where law enforcers demand
information via subpoena or other methods, should release the
data only if the worker consents.
