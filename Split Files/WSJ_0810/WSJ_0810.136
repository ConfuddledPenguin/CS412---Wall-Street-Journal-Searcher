   Kleinwort Benson Group PLC, a British merchant bank, said
pretax profit for the half year to June 30 was little
improved from the year-earlier period at #30.3 million ($56.7
million) after bad-debt provisions and a downturn in its
mergers and acquisitions business in the U.K.
   Pretax profit in the latest half was up only 0.7% from the
year-earlier period's #30.1 million. The results were weaker
than most market forecasts and were seen as a sign of
particular weakness given that first-half 1989 profit was
hurt by a number of factors, including #8 million in losses
associated with now discontinued operations in Australia and
the U.S.

   "These results should be seen against a very different
background to that which prevailed during the comparable
period last year," Kleinwort Chairman David Peake warned.
"Income from the United Kingdom mergers and acquisitions
activity was much lower and conditions in the Japanese equity
markets were unfavorable."
   Profit after tax, or net profit attributable to
shareholders, fell 7% to #19.4 million from #20.9 million a
year earlier. There weren't any extraordinary items in the
latest period, although the year-earlier net profit was
helped by an extraordinary gain of #3.7 million from
disposals.
