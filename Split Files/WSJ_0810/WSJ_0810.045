   LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. -- Alexei Sichev needs a washing
basin, so he's come to Leningrad's biggest shopping mall --
the city dump.
   Neatly dressed in a tweedy jacket, slacks and clean shoes,
the 73-year-old former engineer from Novy Petrodvoretz flips
over a hunk of old wood and pokes at a mound of rotting
paper.

   "I just need one for myself, but there aren't any in the
shops," he complains. "I was told there would be here."
   Other shoppers have come to the same conclusion. Dotted
across the mountains of garbage are people bent over and
busily checking out what the dump has to offer. Some are
looking for specific things, others for anything that strikes
their fancy.
   Some, of course, are drawn by the rock-bottom prices. But
many would willingly pay in an ordinary shop if they could
only find something to buy.
   Twenty miles away on Leningrad's shopping avenue, Nevsky
Prospect, new hard-currency shops cater to tourists and
people swarm around the ice cream stands. But in the
crumbling pastel-colored buildings that were once the center
of Czarist fashion, the state-run stores offer few items and
almost no variety.
   Soviets rarely even use the words "to shop" or "to buy"
when they describe how they came to own something. Rather,
they say "dostat," a word which falls between "to get" and
"to acquire" and is thick with the nuance of pulling strings,
leaning on friends, manipulating bureaucrats and waiting.
That's what it takes for a consumer to connect with a product
here.
   Yuri wants to get his daughter a bicycle, but he's not
powerful enough to pull any very big strings. He's raising
three kids on his disability pay of 97 rubles a month (about
$160 at the official exchange rate or $16 at the more
realistic tourist rate) and his wife's 130 ruble monthly
salary.
   A slight man with a timid manner, he's a little
embarrassed to be shopping at the dump. Like many others, he
doesn't want to give his name. But hoisting his satchel on
his shoulder, he strides resolutely up the dirt road toward
the mountains of trash.
   "There's nothing in the stores," he says, "and here there
is."
   Some people see good business prospects in the dump. On
one hill, three large mounds of clothing are loosely
organized by material. They'll be sold in town by some
energetic entrepreneur.
   On the opposite hill, a wisp of steam rises from a large
rusty double-sink. An elderly man in a worn woolen military
jacket and cap scrubs labels and grime off bottles he has
collected, and a row of clean blue jars glistens in the sun.
   The official dump workers are friendly and almost
protective toward these budding capitalists. A worker breaks
off his chat with the bottle-washer to stomp over in his
heavy rubber boots. "Don't bother him -- what do you want? He
isn't doing anything wrong."
   Indeed, it's not so bad at the Leningrad dump. When the
wind blows the right way, it hardly smells at all because so
little food is thrown out in the Soviet Union. Food shortages
make people economize -- a chicken roasted one day is turned
into a casserole the second and soup on the third.
   Some people have even made the dump their home. On the far
side of the last rotting hill several families lived in tents
until a few weeks ago.
   Then Leningrad Television's highly popular muckraking show
"600 seconds" publicized the story and the government moved
in to clean out the embarrassment. The bulldozer tracks are
still visible among the crushed wild daisies and the
fragments of cloth left behind.
   The idea of people scavenging in dumps wouldn't shock
anyone in New York, but here in the "worker's paradise," such
realities were long seen as the dregs of capitalism. Even
after five years of glasnost, people are shocked to find such
things going on in their own back yard.
   "We knew we didn't live as well here as in the West, but
we thought we had social protection and that at least no one
was homeless or starving," says Nadia, a waitress who herself
lives in an 9-by-12 room with her husband and child and
shares the kitchen and bath with a stranger assigned to the
communal apartment. She saw the program on television.
   "It's disgusting," says Fyodr, a taxi driver and native of
Leningrad who saw the dump life for the first time. "There
goes Glorious Communism."
   No one knows exactly what happened to the dump dwellers.
One wary dump official insists they'd been given apartments
in the city, an idea that makes Leningraders roll their eyes
because apartments are desperately hard to come by. The dump
manager says the families always had permission to live in
the city, but just preferred to live at the dump where they
could be irresponsible.
   "Anyway, even if they're not living here anymore, there
are more living at the other city dumps," he says. "And those
other dumps aren't as nice as this one."
