   Rochester Telephone Corp., Rochester, N.Y., said it has
signed a letter of intent to acquire three telephone
companies from Mid-South Telecommunications, Houston.
   The telephone holding company said the purchase of
Fairmount Telephone, Fairmount, Ga.; Lamar County Telephone,
Millport, Ala.; and Mid-South Telephone, Rienzi, Miss.,
represents an additional 7,900 access lines and two new
states to the company's existing service area. Rochester
Telephone's principal operating territory currently is a
six-county area in Western-Central New York state.
