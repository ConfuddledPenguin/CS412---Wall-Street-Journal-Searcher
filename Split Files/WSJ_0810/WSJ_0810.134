   Central Bancshares of the South Inc. said it definitively

to regulatory approval.

   Central Bancshares said the move fits with its strategy of
strengthening its Texas presence. It said after completion of
the acquisition, which is expected to occur in early 1991,
River Oaks will become part of its Houston-based Compass
Bancshares Inc. unit.
   Terms of the agreement call for Compass to buy all of the
outstanding shares of River Oaks for $17.6 million in cash
and $26.4 million in Central Bancshares preferred stock with
a coupon rate of 8%. River Oaks is 62%-owned by James E.
Lyon, its chairman and chief executive, who plans to vote his
shares in favor of the merger, Central Bancshares said.
   River Oaks includes River Oaks Bank, with assets of $403
million, and River Oaks Trust Co., with $686 million in trust
assets.
