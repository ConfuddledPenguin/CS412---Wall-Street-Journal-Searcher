   NEW YORK -- Even before the dust settles from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, some aggressive money managers are
picking through the rubble of the stock market.
   A lot of fund managers right now are loading up on the
same growth and technology shares they bid up earlier in the
year -- at prices 15% to 20% below their 1990 peak in
mid-July.

   "You're getting a second look" at some good companies,
says Ray Hirsch, a fund manager at IDS Financial Services.
Earlier this week, he added to his funds' holdings in
high-tech companies such as Autodesk Inc.; Novell Inc.;
Sensormatic Electronics Corp., which helps retailers beat
thieves, and several health-care issues.
   Skeptics still abound. They see the specter of war,
ratcheting oil prices, recession and bear markets marching
through the U.S. In coming months, they say, even good stocks
might only get cheaper.
   New York money manager Graham Tanaka of Tanaka Capital has
been adding to his holdings of chip maker Intel Corp.,
Federal National Mortgage Association and Humana Inc., a
hospital company. He's paying prices that are 12 times or
less the companies' projected earnings for 1991. Before the
sell-off, such stocks traded at price-earnings multiples of
14 or 15 and were getting ahead of themselves, he says.
   Because of investors' "war mentality" and the panic
sell-off that followed last week's eruption of the Mideast
crisis, Mr. Tanaka says, many good stocks are being unjustly
clobbered.
   Currently, investors seem to buy and sell stocks more on a
gut feeling -- aversion or enthusiasm -- than on
fundamentals, some analysts say. As the accompanying chart
shows, Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in New York has a
shopping list for bargain-hunters that takes psychology into
account.
   Mr. Birinyi's list of promising stocks includes Household
International Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., waste handler Browning
Ferris Industries Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., General Motors
Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
financial-services company Primerica Corp. Since the market
peaked on July 17, these stocks all have fallen 15% or more.
   For a stock to qualify for Mr. Birinyi's list, it's not
enough for it to have sold off sharply; before the sell-off,
the stock must have attracted enthusiastic buyers.
   Mr. Birinyi gauges how investors feel about a stock by
counting how many trades in that stock are made on "upticks,"
or price gains from the previous trade, as opposed to
downticks. After a panic, such bullish sentiment about the
stock usually revives, he says.
   Mr. Birinyi's favorite stocks exclude many ostensible
bargains that have recently been battered, such as Toys `R'
Us Inc., Limited Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Time Warner Inc.
"They aren't compelling because they didn't have good buying
patterns" before the market tumbled, he says.
   A few investment strategists, such as Morgan Stanley's
Byron Wien, say the time is approaching when it might be
worth gambling on cyclical companies such as banks, airlines,
papers and chemicals. "I'm not ready to buy these groups yet,
but they're the next wave," says Mr. Wien.
   After the Iraqi invasion, Mr. Wien adds, "the market was
showing climactic behavior (huge price declines and heavy
trading volume) that looked like a bottom." So, this week,
Mr. Wien began recommending United Telecommunications Inc.,
MCI Communications Corp., Intel, Walt Disney Co., Toys `R' Us
and Primerica. The stocks were recently knocked down to
"distressed" levels and probably won't fall much even if the
market goes to 2400, he says.
   However, if there's a prolonged war in the Middle East, or
a bad recession, Mr. Wien says, all bets are off and even
distressed stocks might have a long way to fall. And Mr.
Hirsch of IDS says that if there's a recession, "I may
reverse some of my aggressive investments" in growth stocks.
   Of course, many aggressive investors are playing the
Mideast panic by chasing energy issues. These are mostly
pretty expensive, but a lot of people like to buy stocks that
are going up -- they have "momentum," in Wall Street jargon.
   According to Mr. Birinyi, energy stocks with good buying
patterns are Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., and two big oil
service companies, Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton Co. He
says buying has been "uneven" in Texaco Inc., Unocal Corp.,
Kerr-McGee Corp. and Amoco Corp.
   Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland, a New York brokerage firm,
thinks the real bargains for long-term investors in energy
are certain oil refiners. The stocks have been killed lately,
because of rising prices for the oil they must buy to refine.
But Mr. Gaines thinks refiners that sell much of their
product in the "wholesale" market, such as Diamond Shamrock
R&amp;M Inc. and Horsham Corp., will find their industrial
customers more willing to accept price increases than
motorists are. Mr. Gaines has owned refining stocks for some
time, and thinks Tosco Corp. "might be interesting" a bit
below current levels.
   A lot of usually bold investors are staying on the
sidelines.
   "This isn't the time to be a hero," says New York money
manager Martin Sass of M.D. Sass Investors Services.
   After the 1987 crash, Mr. Sass jumped right back into the
market, but this time he is much gloomier about the economy.
He has been selling copper stocks, he says, and "dramatically
lightening up on airlines, which have a double negative" --
they're facing much higher fuel prices and usually have far
fewer passengers when the economy turns down.
   First Boston analyst Carmine Grigoli warns against the
"fatal attraction" of seemingly cheap stocks. For instance,
many bank stocks are at rock-bottom prices and offer huge
dividend yields, and have attracted buying from such famous
investors as Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS Inc.
   But the whole banking industry is under pressure to boost
capital, so bearish types expect many banks to cut their
dividends to save money. Banks also are dogged by rising
defaults on loans they made in better days. The shareholder
of a bank, Mr. Grigoli says, is "the ultimate creditor;" he's
lowest on the totem pole and is the real owner of the bank's
bad loans and troubled real estate.
   Some traders see signs that bargain shoppers are just
defending their investment portfolios. That is, they're
loading up on stocks they already own, hoping to recover
their losses, but they aren't making new investment decisions
that reflect higher oil prices and other changes in the
economic picture.
   As Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer &amp; Co. trader, puts
it: "We're seeing a lot of negative selection" of stocks.
