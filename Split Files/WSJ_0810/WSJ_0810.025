   A federal judge gave Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp.
permission to provide international long-distance service
between the U.S. and New Zealand through Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand.
   New Zealand's government in June picked the two Baby Bells
to buy the state-owned phone company for about $2.46 billion,
and the transaction is expected to be completed next month.
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic immediately sought a waiver from
the consent decree that broke up the Bell System to permit
them, through Telecom, to handle the New Zealand portion of
telecommunications traffic between the two countries.

   Among other things, the consent decree bars the Baby Bells
from the long-distance business. Judge Harold Greene, who
oversees the decree, granted the waiver request and gave the
Baby Bells permission to own minority stakes in international
satellite and undersea cables.
   Judge Greene, however, stipulated that the companies,
through Telecom, can't own more than 10% of undersea cables
or international satellite systems. He also said that Telecom
can't provide long-distance service in the U.S. or own
international facilities, such as satellite earth stations,
in the U.S.
   In addition, the judge barred the two U.S. phone companies
from marketing Telecom's international service in the U.S.,
adding that Telecom can't interconnect with Bell Atlantic's
or Ameritech's domestic networks.
   In granting the waiver, Judge Greene gave the regional
Bell companies more encouragement as they venture overseas.
The proposed purchase of the New Zealand phone company, he
said, "constitutes a one-time opportunity to export American
telecommunications expertise and technology." The
opportunity, he said, meshes with his policy of "encouraging
foreign business ventures by the regional companies where
this can be done consistently with the decree."
   At the same time, he emphasized that he wasn't considering
a blanket waiver that would permit the Baby Bells to acquire
10% of any business the consent decree bars them from
entering. He said the waiver shouldn't be read as an
indication that future requests to enter for overseas
businesses will be "blindly granted."
   Under the agreement, two New Zealand companies,
Freightways Holdings Ltd., a conglomerate, and Fay, Richwhite
Holdings Ltd., a merchant bank, initially will have a
combined stake of less than 1%. The interest will grow to 10%
over the next three years, while Bell Atlantic and Ameritech
will reduce their combined stake to 49.9% through a series of
stock offerings that could begin as early as next year.
   MCI Communications Corp. had objected to the waiver
request on grounds that the Bells could discriminate in their
selection of international carriers, particularly when MCI,
which is also involved in a New Zealand long-distance
venture, goes into competition with Telecom of New Zealand.
But while Judge Greene acknowledged that MCI may be correct,
he said "such local discrimination is of no legitimate
concern to the court unless it is likely to affect the U.S.
segment of those calls."
   An MCI spokesman said Judge Greene "took into account
satisfactorily the concerns that we had raised," citing the
judge's restrictions on ownership of international cables and
satellites and prohibition against discrimination against
U.S. international carriers.
