   INVESTCORP INTERNATIONAL Inc. (New York) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on the company's
Color Tile Inc. senior debt to single-B from single-B-plus,
subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus and
preferred stock to triple-C from single-B-minus. About $280
million in securities is affected by the move. S&amp;P said the
ratings downgrades reflect Color Tile's highly leveraged
capital structure and low cash flow.
