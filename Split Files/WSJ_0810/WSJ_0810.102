   WASHINGTON -- The Bush adminstration has decided for now
not to use the one weapon in its arsenal that could help keep
oil prices down.
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday that
the administration had no intention "at this time" of drawing
from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve to offset the
oil shortfall caused by the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait. The
decision came as a surprise to some oil experts, who say use
of emergency reserves would push down the price of oil.

   "If we're not going to use it when we send troops into the
Persian Gulf, when are we going to use it?" asked William
Hogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, who
said a presidential announcement of plans to draw a modest
amount from the reserves could reduce the oil price by "a
couple of dollars a barrel."
   Meanwhile, world crude prices fell about 25 cents a barrel
yesterday as markets awaited fresh news from the Middle East.
And several more oil companies said they were cutting their
gasoline prices.
   Texaco Inc., British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit and the
Conoco unit of Du Pont Co. said they were reducing gasoline
prices around three cents a gallon in response to the
declines in crude, which have fallen more than $3 in the past
two days from highs of $29 a barrel.
   Phillips Petroleum Co., which led the price cutting with a
4.5-cent cut Wednesday, said yesterday it was further
reducing prices an average of 1.8 cents a gallon. A number of
other major companies have said they were capping gasoline
prices for some time.
   Oil companies were responding to the drop in the crude
market and to President Bush's call on the industry to show
restraint. But the swiftness of the gasoline-price reductions
is unusual. "We're not in a normal situation," said a
spokeswoman for BP America Inc. in Cleveland.
   The administration's decision not to use its emergency
petroleum reserves is certain to draw political attack. Sen.
Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) has already criticized the
administration for its reluctance. "President Bush has taken
a decisive step by committing American forces to protect our
long-term interests in Saudi Arabia," Sen. Bradley said, but
"unfortunately, the president has not yet acted to protect
the interests of American consumers, who . . . have faced
gasoline-price increases of up to fifteen cents a gallon."
   "We already have a fragile, weakened economy and we don't
need this kind of impact," said Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.,
Mo.). "If we've got the {reserve} we built for this purpose,
we ought to be willing to use it."
   The administration's decision was made public yesterday as
the International Energy Agency, made up of 21 industrial
nations, met in Paris. Following the meeting, Ulrich
Engelmann, the chairman of the group's governing board, said
the group had concluded that no physical shortages of oil
exist at this time, and therefore there is no need to draw
down emergency reserves.
   Later, Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack said in
an interview that there is "a general consensus that things
are on track" and that "there is no need at this time to
release stocks."
   Administration officials say they were reluctant to use
the reserves in part because they didn't want the government
to get involved in influencing oil prices. In addition, they
said the White House is reluctant to use the strategic
petroleum reserve because it would take pressure off of Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing nations to increase
their production.
   But Rep. Phil Sharp (D., Ind.) said the administration
"should be demonstrating to the market place that we have
this major supply of government oil, and we are prepared to
use it." Mr. Sharp is chairman of a House energy
subcommittee.
   The oil markets were relatively quiet yesterday after
nearly a week of pandemonium. "Everybody is waiting for some
new news," said Ted Eck, Amoco Corp's chief economist.
   On the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil
trader Eric Bolling said: "It's been such a rumor mill down
here for so long that any rumor would move the market $2.
Today nothing came out."
   Oil traders seem prepared to drive prices in either
direction. "I wouldn't bet a dollar oil will be $20 or $40 in
six months but I would bet a dollar it will hit both ends of
that range within the next six months," Mr. Bolling said.
   The embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil is expected to remove
about four million barrels a day of oil production from world
markets. Mr. McCormack of the State Department said
agreements by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing
nations to boost production can "very largely make up" that
shortfall.
   Many private analysts believe, however, that oil
production may still be as much as one million barrels a day
below its levels before the embargo. If the administration
would agree to fill that gap with oil from its strategic
reserves, "we'd probably be $3 a barrel lower," says Philip
Verleger of the Institute for International Economics.
   Administration officials say they are still willing to use
the reserves, if conditions call for it. One official said a
disruption of Saudi oil fields by the Iraqis might prompt the
U.S. to begin pumping oil from its reserves.
   For oil companies, the question of security of supply has
become crucial, particularly with the curbed flow from the
Middle East and President Bush's reluctance to open the
strategic petroleum reserve. "The best thing is for oil
companies to make sure they don't have shortages," said
Amoco's Mr. Eck. "The worst case is shortages," he added,
from local service stations running out of gasoline to oil
companies short of crude to run their refineries.
   Amoco's refining system is running at full capacity, Mr.
Eck said, as is virtually the entire U.S. refining system. It
ran at nearly 95% of capacity in the week ended Aug. 3, which
effectively is full-out, refiners say.
   Before the Middle East crisis, oil prices had been sharply
lower because of perceptions of a world-wide crude glut. Even
in the latest week crude inventories in the U.S. were 46
million barrels higher than at this time last year. But now
instead of an unwanted surplus those barrels are perceived as
precious stocks that companies are loathe to sell.
   To avoid any run on gasoline supplies, many refiners have
gone to an allocation system at the refinery gate that limits
gasoline sales to individual wholesale buyers to prevent any
hoarding, said Bill Hermann, chief economist for Chevron
Corp. in San Francisco. "We're not going to be delivering or
letting any individual jobber, distributor or dealer buy
three times as much {gasoline} as he bought at this time last
year," Mr. Hermann said.
