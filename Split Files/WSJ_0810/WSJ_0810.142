   FEARS MOUNTED for Americans and other foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Despite an unclear official Iraqi position, Baghdad
appeared to be refusing to let nondiplomatic foreigners
leave, and 38 Americans remained detained in a Baghdad hotel.
One group of Americans were turned back when they tried to
cross the Iraqi-Jordanian border. Some 3,000 Americans are
still in Kuwait, and nearly 600 in Iraq. The U.S. said that
it doesn't consider the Americans to be hostages and
expressed gratification that their treatment didn't seem to
differ from that of other foreigners.

   Arab leaders in Cairo delayed a meeting on the crisis
until today as speculation grew that they may consider a
solution under which Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait in
return for financial concessions from the Kuwaitis. The U.N.
Security Council unanimously declared Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait void, and Baghdad also apparently lost the support of
Yemen and Jordan. Iraq fortified its positions on the
Kuwaiti-Saudi border, but the U.S. didn't detect preparations
for an invasion.
   The U.S. gave its strongest signal yet that it is prepared
to use a naval blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports. U.S.,
British and French vessels were stationed in the Persian Gulf
region.

other Southern states, has been maintained to prevent blacks
from being elected.

   West German Chancellor Kohl scrapped plans to make Oct. 14
the date for unification and all-German elections. Kohl set
off a political backlash last week when he endorsed a call
from East Germany's de Maiziere to move up the date. Parties

of economic restructuring.

   Scientists uncovered clues about how a recently discovered
gene may cause neurofibromatosis, mistakenly called the
Elephant Man's disease. The gene is related to those involved

treatment for the disease as well as insight into cancer's
genetic bases.

   Peruvian troops shot and killed three rioters in Lima
during unrest over austerity measures, announced Wednesday,

3,000% annual inflation rate.

   Riots erupted for a third night in Port Elizabeth, South

collaborators with apartheid.

administration "controlled and obstructed" a federal study of
Agent Orange exposure among Vietnam veterans. The House

of veterans who filed a suit last week seeking resumption of
the study, canceled in 1987.

last week.

   A NASA panel said it found an error of about one
millimeter in a measuring device used to grind the mirror of
the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. One analyst termed such
an error "astonishing" in the precise field of optics. The
committee is investigating focusing problems that have
crippled the telescope, launched in April.
