   Keith Robertson collects poker books for the love of the
game, of the books and of the chase. The game came first:
He's been playing in the same "First Friday Poker Club" for
20-plus years. Mr. Robertson, who is 75 years old, lives in
Hopewell, N.J., and is himself an accomplished author with 33
books to his credit. He acquired his first poker volume in
1979, and now has the largest collection in the U.S. and
probably the world. It numbers 99 titles and includes just
about everything from before 1940 plus the best of what has
been published since.
   Mr. Robertson began collecting poker books as a way of
occupying himself while on buying expeditions with his wife,
Elizabeth Woodburn, a dealer in horticultural books. (They
met in 1946 in a Gimbel's book department Ms. Woodburn was
redoing; that was a Wednesday and they were married on
Saturday.)

   The jewel of Mr. Robertson's library is the first book
ever written on the subject, "Rules for Playing Poker." Its
author, Robert C. Schenck, was the American ambassador to
Great Britain in 1872. While visiting a country house in
Somersetshire, he taught the game to the other guests,
perhaps including Queen Victoria, though that has never been
documented. He wrote down the rules at the request of his
hostess, identified only as "Lady W.," and another guest
printed them up on his private press. The New York Tribune
reprinted his rules in July 1875, and an unidentified
publisher produced them in pamphlet form in the U.S. that
same year.
   Unfortunately for Schenck, poker has always had its seamy
side, and Victorian society clearly did not approve of its
diplomats being associated with the game, at least not
publicly. The event "brought down on me the wrath and
reprehension of so many good people in America," Schenck
wrote to a friend, and the scandal cost him his ambassadorial
position.
   Mr. Robertson found the only known copy of the 1875
American edition at a book fair at Bryn Mawr College in 1982.
He bought the tiny, eight-page booklet from a Washington,
D.C., rare-book dealer, Willis VanDevanter. "When I
discovered I had the first American edition of the first
printed work on poker," Mr. Robertson says, "retreat was no
longer possible; I was an addicted collector."
   As a wish list, Mr. Robertson uses a bibliography of all
the poker books published prior to 1905 that he found in R.F.
Foster's "Practical Poker" (Brentano's, New York, 1905). Of
the 42 titles listed, he is missing only "Poker: Its Laws and
Practice" (Pioneer Press, Allahabad, India, 1879) by Albert
Percy. Mr. Robertson thinks he might locate it in India, but
is not optimistic: "Book dealers in India tend to keep
everything stacked on the floor; they may have what you want
but that doesn't mean you'll find it."
   The books in Mr. Robertson's collection are surprisingly
varied, ranging from the expected "how to" titles focusing on
odds and strategies all the way to moral novels such as "The
Lapse of Enoch Wentworth, the Story of a Player Redeemed"
(F.G. Browne &amp; Co., Chicago, 1913) by Elizabeth Gordon
Curtis.
   In the category of novelties, there's "Poker Smoke and
Other Things" (Reilly &amp; Briton Co., Chicago, 1907) by Percy
Hammond and George Wharton. It begins with an outrageous
history of the game, describing how "Noah wanted to play
poker on the Ark but was unable to do so because there was no
deck." A chapter on "Gratuitous Advice" counsels, "When you
unexpectedly pick up three aces look indifferent and hum a
popular air. This gives the impression that you have a poor
hand." The "smoke" of the title refers not to the art of
bluffing but to a collection of verses on the joys of
tobacco. "Other Things" includes recipes for food and drink
appropriate to the poker table.
   Another novelty from the same period is "Shakespeare on
Poker" (Ballard Publishing Co., Denver, 1906), a collection
of 12 illustrations of hands captioned with verse. Four aces
is "a consummation devoutly to be wished." A straight flush
of diamonds to the queen is "a lady walled about with
diamonds -- look you what I have."
   The social history reflected by Mr. Robertson's books is
not always so benign. "The Thompson Street Poker Club" and
"The Mott Street Poker Club" (White &amp; Allen, New York,
1888-89) portray blacks as dupes and Chinese as venal,
cowardly and easily intimidated. The works claim "a prominent
author" but do not mention any name; a curious book dealer
has identified the author as Henry Guy Carleton. The "Poker
Club" series must have been popular; there were four titles
and multiple editions, including at least one "deluxe"
printing.
   Several books in Mr. Robertson's collection celebrate the
male bonding among poker buddies. One of them is "The Poker
Rubaiyat" (Bandar Log Press, New York, 1902) by Frank Holme,
a highly regarded newspaper artist who fell ill with
tuberculosis in 1901. He didn't have much money, so some of
his poker friends "incorporated" him (he was the first man
ever to have this distinction) and underwrote his treatment
in Phoenix. To pay his friends back, Holme collaborated with
Kirke La Shelle on this unusual volume of 12 multicolor
wood-block illustrations, which he carved with a jackknife.
The artist did not recover and died in Denver in 1904.
   Patterson Smith, a New Jersey rare-book dealer, describes
"The Poker Rubaiyat" as "the most visually striking book on
the great American game," a fitting epitaph for a talented
illustrator. Bandar Log printed 284 copies in 1902 to sell at
$5. Mr. Robertson paid $300 for his copy in 1982.
   Has owning all these books helped Mr. Robertson's own
performance at the poker table? No, he says, you could read
every book on his shelves and still lose at the table. "You
can learn a good deal from the books about the odds and the
possibilities for improving your hand, but the real test of a
good poker player is his ability to judge character."
   His books agree with him. A renowned poker player named
Herbert O. Yardley summed it up in "The Education of a Poker
Player" (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1957): "If you want to
know when to call and when to bluff, identify yourself with
your opponent's cunning."
