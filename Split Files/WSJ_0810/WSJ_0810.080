   NEW YORK -- William H. Donaldson, the New York Stock
Exchange's new chairman, says the Big Board must cut costs to
members to stem the exchange's eroding market share.
   "There's got to be a continuing emphasis on the cost and
expense side of doing business," Mr. Donaldson says of the
Big Board, which currently handles about 80% of all shares
traded in its own listed stocks.

   As expected, the Big Board ended a six-month search for a
new chief by naming Mr. Donaldson as its new chairman. The
59-year-old Mr. Donaldson, a former Big Board director and a
founder of the securities firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc., succeeds John J. Phelan Jr., who is retiring
at year's end.
   The exchange also softened the blow for Richard A. Grasso,
who had been actively lobbying to succeed Mr. Phelan. Mr.
Grasso, who has been the exchange's president and chief
operating officer, will take the job of executive vice
chairman when Richard R. Shinn retires at year's end.
   For his part, Mr. Donaldson has a host of tough issues to
deal with, including a slow erosion of the Big Board's
trading business to regional and overseas exchanges, and the
prospect of global 24-hour and electronic trading.
   Reflecting the hard times in the securities industry, the
Big Board had net income of $6.3 million last year, down 40%
from the year earlier, on revenue of $349.3 million.
   Other securities executives and Big Board members echoed
Mr. Donaldson's call for lowering costs to brokerage firms of
trading on the exchange. The Big Board doesn't necessarily
have to be the cheapest place to trade stocks, says Benjamin
F. Edwards III, chairman of the St. Louis-based brokerage
firm A.G. Edwards Inc. and a Big Board director. But "I think
they can get more competitive," he said.
   Mr. Donaldson has strong industry and management
credentials for his new job. He left the securities firm that
bears his name in 1973 to become U.S. undersecretary of state
to Henry Kissinger, and later was founding dean and professor
of management at the Yale Graduate School of Management.
   When he joins the Big Board, Mr. Donaldson says he will
resign from Donaldson Enterprises Inc., a private investment
firm he heads.
   Before selecting Mr. Donaldson, the exchange interviewed
150 people for the job, although there were only a handful of
serious candidates. The exchange "couldn't have gotten a
finer selection than Bill Donaldson," said Mr. Phelan, who
led the nation's biggest exchange for six years.
   Mr. Phelan will become the chairman of the Aspen Institute
and president of the International Federation of Stock
Exchanges.
   Among the challenges Mr. Donaldson says the exchange faces
is using new trading technologies, developing new investment
products and addressing the increasing internationalization
of the financial markets. The Big Board must "explore the
boundaries and competition as they evolve throughout the
world," he said.
   On the home front, he says the exchange should "step out
and be a true self-regulatory organization that takes a lead
on whatever conflicts arise."
