   Price gouging] Unfairly profiting from a crisis] The oil
industry has endured a steady stream of invectives hurled at
it since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week and prices at local
gas pumps soared.
   In oil company spin-control quarters and at ad agencies
around the country, though, the oil companies are thinking of
ways to fight back -- with advertising. Mobil yesterday
became the first of the pack to lash out against its critics,
with a newspaper ad headlined, "Where's the rip-off?" Rising
gas prices, the ad went on to say, have "sparked thousands of
words, most of them accusing the oil industry of reaping
undeserved profits. Industry spokesmen have attempted to
respond, with little apparent success."

   Mobil's ad, which insists the oil giant isn't passing on
the full brunt of price increases to consumers, almost
certainly won't be the last Big Oil advertising apologia.
Texaco, Exxon, Atlantic Richfield and Amoco are among other
major oil companies that say they are investigating
advertising about the crisis, although all say no decisions
have been made yet.
   "The oil industry and our company have a legitimate point
of view, and it tends to be overlooked in times of crisis,"
says Donald Tuchman, the Mobil public-relations executive who
wrote the Mobil ad. "A lot of people resort to name-calling
and look for a scapegoat, and a lot of times that scapegoat
happens to be business. We hope people will read this and see
that there's a legitimate point of view on the other side."
   As the oil companies grapple with ad strategies, though,
they find themselves in a predicament: how to keep any ad
current when the Mideast situation is in such flux. With
unanswered questions about whether the crisis will escalate
and how long it will last, trumpeting any ad message about
the situation is taking a calculated risk.
   "We've got two armies staring at each other over a border.
We'll see what happens," says an Amoco spokesman. "We're
reviewing a number of different options," he adds, "but right
now we haven't got an answer."
   One option is to simply stop advertising altogether. If
hostilities mount and oil shortages result, ad executives say
that would be the most likely scenario for the industry.
During the 1973 oil embargo, when long lines and sky-high gas
prices were the rule, oil company advertising dried up almost
completely; the companies were embarrassed and baffled over
how to confront consumers who were already irritated by
shortages.
   This time around, should shortages occur, "it's very
probable the industry investment in advertising as a total
might drop" again, says James Hine, managing director of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Houston, whose clients include Shell. But
he hastens to add, "as an advertising man, I think it's a
very bad idea."
   A better idea, at least in ad executives' admittedly
self-preservationist minds, would be to tackle head-on in ads
whatever problems arise. The executives are already
scrambling to unearth mid-1970s oil company ads for lessons
in damage control. At that time, after advertising initially
dried up, the oil companies began weighing in with public
service-style ads preaching conservation. They also embarked
on the industry's first appearance-primping image ads, the
kind talking about all the good work they are doing for small
children and trees.
   Shell, for example, introduced the "Shell Answer Man," who
offered tips on saving fuel, in the aftermath of the 1973
embargo. Mobil, which began to issue advertising in
newspapers in 1970, stepped up its campaign and started
discussing major issues in TV commercials as well.
Ultimately, the major networks refused to run the sometimes
politically sensitive commercials, but Mobil continued to run
them on independent stations through the late 1970s.
   As the Mideast crisis wears on, the oil companies may well
look into updating old standards like those. They also may
take a page from investment houses, which rushed to create
new ads in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash.
Then, firms like Prudential-Bache and Shearson Lehman churned
out newspaper and TV ads attempting to calm jittery
investors.
   Among the oil companies, Mobil is perhaps best situated to
create quick turnaround ads like those. It has cranked out
issue ads virtually every week for 20 years, ever since it
began running weekly ads on the New York Times op-ed page,
and by now has the routine down to a science. Yesterday's
"Where's the rip-off?" ad, for example, was written in-house
Tuesday morning and put into type Wednesday, for a turnaround
time of less than two days.
   But even Mobil doesn't know what to say in next week's
ads, or whether to pump up its advertising efforts. "Just as
this situation is in flux, so is our strategy," says Mr.
Tuchman. "I'm sure we'll have much more to say. But now we're
watching the news, just like everybody else."

   JWT's First Nuprin Ad
                                                                                                       

   A new TV commercial for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Nuprin
brand -- one that asks consumers to "Tell Nuprin Where it
Hurts" -- will begin airing tonight.
   The ad is the first from J. Walter Thompson, the New York
shop named just last month to replace Grey Advertising as
agency for the $30 million account.
   Bristol-Myers tapped Thompson, a unit of WPP Group,
following a review in which it asked a few agencies for ideas
on how to fire up sales of Nuprin, an ibuprofen pain reliever
that has been a distant competitor to market leader Advil.
   The Thompson spots show adults as victim to various kinds
of pain, like head and back, and make the pitch that Nuprin
is the answer to all of them. Pain-plagued consumers shown
jogging and driving cars are the spots' stars.
   The spots also feature a neon "body map" showing how
Nuprin goes after pain. And reminiscent of Grey's old
campaign showing the "little, yellow, different" pills as the
only color in otherwise black-and-white spots, the new ads
show Nuprin pills glowing in the "body's" neon hand.

   FOOTE CONE: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications, Chicago,

million from $79.6 million a year earlier.

   NESCAFE ADS: Nescafe today begins airing ads for its new
Brazilian Supreme and Colombian Gold instant coffees,
positioning the varieties as the choice of those "who have a
passion for coffee." In one ad, a Latin beat rumbles as a
handsome young couple meets for a cup of morning brew. "South
Americans have a passion for life," an announcer says. "And
the coffee they feel most passionate about is Nescafe." The
ads were created by McCann-Erickson's New York office.
