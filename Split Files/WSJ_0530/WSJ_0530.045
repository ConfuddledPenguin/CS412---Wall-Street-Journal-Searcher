   LONDON -- Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French group constructing
a tunnel beneath the English Channel, said the European
Investment Bank has promised an increase in loans to the
troubled project.
   The European Investment Bank is a Luxembourg-based lending
institution owned by the governments of European Community.
Eurotunnel also said that the group of commercial banks
supplying the bulk of its financing have approved further
drawdowns on the original syndicated loan facilities while
additional funding is put in place.

   Eurotunnel is trying to arrange a #2.5 billion ($4.22
billion) expansion of the credits and equity funds available
to it to cover an increase in the estimated cost of
completing the project. The new funds would increase
Eurotunnel's funds to about #8.5 billion from #6 billion.
