   NAGOYA, Japan -- Banking is a dying trade at Higashi Chita
Agricultural Cooperative Bank. Big-city interlopers are
trying to woo away the cooperative's newly affluent customers
with splashy services. But it has found a niche: funerals.
   The co-op helps customers and their families arrange
cremations and family altars, get floral wreaths and
distribute inheritances. Its slick banking rivals may beat
the co-op on lending and deposit rates, its officials reason,
but not on neighborly compassion. "If we can handle this
well," says Hisaki Matsuura, a planning manager, "we will be
able to establish eternal relationships" with the bereaved.
Last year, the co-op handled 234 funerals in the suburbs of
this smokestack city.

   In the land of financial giants, where the 10 biggest
domestic banks are also the world's 10 biggest, Higashi Chita
is a Lilliputian. But its offbeat moves to survive in a newly
hostile environment illustrate the turmoil in Japan's
once-coddled financial industry.
   Goaded by rapid liberalization of financial regulations,
Japan's banks are having to change the way they do business.
Big-city institutions are focusing increasingly on the
domestic market and seeking to set themselves apart from the
pack. Medium-size and regional banks are talking about
mergers. And small banks and specialized institutions are
fighting for their lives. Government officials even speculate
openly about the possibility of the first bank collapses
since World War II.
   In Hiroshima, locals joke that the battle among the banks
resembles gang warfare. Nearly every major commercial bank in
Japan is represented in the western coastal city, and so
fierce is the competition for customers that interest rates
paid on deposits are, surprisingly, higher than in Tokyo.
Hiroshima Bank, a big regional bank, recently escalated the
war by deciding to open on Sundays. Hiroshima City
Agricultural Cooperative tries a soft sell: Its telephone
operators answer calls in English with a cheerful "Howdy]"
   The sweeping change in Japanese banks has implications for
the way they do business overseas, too. Bankers and
government officials say the overhaul of Japan's domestic
banking industry in coming years will reduce the
international competitive power of its financial giants.
   With nearly $7 trillion in assets, Japanese deposit-taking
institutions already face some constraints on lending because
of tougher international rules requiring them to back up new
loans with fresh capital and because of the difficulty of
raising capital as the Japanese stock market plummeted in the
first quarter. And with the prospect of a huge restructuring
in domestic banking, Japanese banks will be less able to push
their foreign businesses.
   "The big banks will have to become more cautious about
international expansion," says Junichi Ishikawa, executive
managing director of Kyowa Bank Ltd.
   He should know: Starting in 1985, Kyowa trimmed its
foreign role and revamped its domestic operations to focus
exclusively on small and medium-sized borrowers in Japan.
Today, its staff has shrunk by one-quarter to 7,200 full-time
employees and its corporate-loan portfolio by $2 billion. So
far, its profits haven't soared far above those of other
banks, but credit analysts routinely cite Kyowa as the
smartest of Japan's big banks.
   The prospect of such important changes has attracted
advocates of even-faster reform. Worried by the relative ease
with which Japan's well-protected banks had been displacing
their U.S. and European rivals over the past decade,
Washington has been demanding with increasing force that
Japan accelerate its financial liberalization. Last week in
Tokyo, U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford warned
Ministry of Finance officials that unless Japan acts soon to
deregulate deposit rates further, the U.S. Congress is likely
to pass a proposal authorizing retaliation against Japanese
banks operating in the U.S.
   The repercussions could be serious. The biggest bloc of
foreign banks in the U.S. is Japanese; they own four of the
top 10 banks in California. Sensing the heat, Japan's major
business newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, editorialized
recently that "Japan's attitude . . . not only lacks in
consideration towards the international situation but lacks
from the domestic depositors' viewpoint as well."
   The U.S. pressure didn't sway the Japanese officials,
though. They say their government will complete the process
of deregulation as quickly as it can, and no sooner. After
six years of U.S. prodding, they note, Japan already has made
substantial strides toward complete deregulation. But any
interest-rate regulations are unfair, U.S. officials argue,
because the very low levels of interest that Japanese banks
pay depositors give the institutions a vast source of cheap
funding and enable them to lend that money at interest rates
well below those that U.S. and other international banks can
afford.
   The Japanese don't agree. "The reality is that the
weakness of U.S. banks is a problem made by their big
mistakes, not regulation here," a Finance Ministry official
says. "We are deregulating as a matter of fairness to small
depositors who deserve better rates, not for U.S. banks."
   Though officials in Washington may not have felt the
breeze of change, a financial tornado is already blasting
through Japan. Most significant is the effect of
interest-rate deregulation. The once-guaranteed profit
margins from government-set interest-rate spreads -- most
banks make money by lending at higher interest rates than
they pay depositors -- have given way to market-set, floating
rates and razor-thin rate spreads. Unregulated accounts now
constitute nearly 70% of the $1.2 trillion on deposit at
Japan's 12 big commercial banks. Even at agricultural co-ops,
the share of unregulated deposits has soared to nearly 30%
from none a year ago.
   So, profit margins are narrowing, and Japanese banks will
have to find ways to compete harder against one another. Some
of them are casting about for marriage partners. Recently,
two giants, Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., fused
together to form Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., the world's
second-largest bank with more than $400 billion in assets.
   Medium-sized Tokai Bank often hints that it would be a
merger candidate for a strong domestic bank, and even mighty
Mitsubishi Bank acknowledges that it would consider the right
suitor. Still others -- notably Bank of Tokyo, which has a
small domestic branch network and an expensive string of
international offices -- routinely have to deny speculation
that they might be takeover or merger candidates.
   While the winds of deregulation are rattling some Japanese
banks, at least one foreign bank, Citicorp, is lurking like a
vulture hoping to feast on the carnage. After long trying
unsuccessfully to buy its way into Japan's retail market, its
Citibank unit recently won Finance Ministry clearance to open
virtually as many branches as it wants. Masamoto Yashiro, who
was hired from Exxon Corp.'s Japanese subsidiary to head
Citibank's retail efforts, thinks that within a decade the
bank may have 50 to 70 retail branches, mostly in Tokyo, up
from eight now.
   "Deregulation will provide us with opportunities to grow
faster," Mr. Yashiro predicts. Citibank hopes to exploit its
cachet as the only foreign bank in Tokyo's retail market and
win business from Japanese with experience or business
interests overseas. "We want to be selective," Mr. Yashiro
says, aiming for only relatively well-off Japanese. "We want
to segment the population, we want to segment products, we
want to segment services."
   That sort of specialization is one tactic that other banks
inevitably will follow as the government eliminates current
legal distinctions among them. Japanese banks have long been
protected not only from market interest rates but from banks
in other business areas: Commercial banks handled corporate
and retail loans; regional banks handled smaller companies;
trust banks were independent, and long-term credit banks
doled out term loans. Until the early 1980s, Bank of Tokyo
even had a near-monopoly on foreign-exchange and overseas
transactions.
   However, the barriers between different types of banks are
crashing down, and many smaller financial institutions, such
as Higashi Chita Agricultural Cooperative Bank, are facing
direct competition from bigger, broader rivals. The result
will be a painful consolidation. In April alone, there were
nine mergers of banks and credit cooperatives, affecting both
big and small institutions. In one Tokyo neighborhood, a pair
of tiny, one-branch credit unions recently merged to become
the 175th-largest credit union -- the first marriage of
credit unions in 15 years.
   "We anticipate a complete reorganization of the industry,"
one government official says. Mindful of the problems after
the U.S. unfettered savings and loan associations a decade
and perhaps $500 billion ago, Japan seeks to deregulate
slowly and do it right. "We don't want to see an S&amp;L crisis,"
a Finance Ministry official says. He adds that Japan's
deposit-insurance program has only a few billion dollars in
assets -- not enough to bail out even one of the 100 biggest
banks in Japan.
   To avoid bank failures, the government is expected to take
an active role in the industry's consolidation, steering
troubled institutions into one another's arms. But the
gravest problem area lies outside the Finance Ministry's
usual realm, in the agricultural cooperatives. The parallels
between the cooperatives and America's S&amp;Ls worry many
analysts.
   Japan now has 3,700 co-ops, many of them small, one-branch
operations originally set up by American occupation forces to
collect deposits from farmers. The money then is either lent
to other farmers or channeled upstream to prefectural
cooperatives, which, in turn, lend it or pass it on to
Norinchukin, Japan's giant agricultural bank. Norinchukin
invests most of its money -- its assets totaled $235.7
billion as of March 31 -- in U.S. and Japanese government
bonds.
   As deregulation sets in, though, the financial
institutions in the agricultural sector will want the right
to invest elsewhere, much like what happened when U.S. S&amp;Ls
were unregulated. The agricultural sector was perfectly happy
with its earlier role, when it made money, largely through
its bond investments and the fixed spreads between deposit
and lending rates, and was in no hurry to change. Indeed,
agriculture's political clout is one reason some analysts
think that the Finance Ministry hasn't already acceded to
U.S. requests for complete interest-rate deregulation.
   "Financial reform will have an unfathomable impact on the
system of agricultural cooperatives, shaking it from the very
bottom," warns Yoshiyuki Onodera, a senior researcher at the
National Institute of Agricultural Economics. Comparing the
importance to the agricultural sector of importing foreign
rice -- long a contentious issue -- and the importance of
financial deregulation, Mr. Onodera says, "The difference in
impact is as great as that between TNT and the atomic bomb."
   When deposit rates are deregulated at all lending
institutions, the farm lobby contends, loan rates will rise,
and food prices may rise as well. Even worse, critics say,
farmers soon will expect higher returns on their co-op
deposits -- now, deposits of less than 10 million yen,
including the majority of accounts at agricultural
cooperatives, are regulated -- and when they do, the coops
will be in trouble. Either farmers will remove their money
from them and put it in commercial banks, or the co-ops will
have to find ways to earn more so they can afford to pay
more.
   To avert some problems, the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry hopes to close or merge two-thirds of the
co-ops by the year 2000. But even that is risky. Their loans
would have to be sold, and many of the loans are low-quality,
made by small-town co-ops to friendly businessmen or farmers.
One solution, an official suggests, would be to package the
loans and sell them as interest-bearing securities, perhaps
to Norinchukin.
   Doing that, however, would open another regulatory issue,
the separation of Japan's banking and securities industries.
Legislation patterned after the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act
prohibits the two industries from invading each other's turf.
Allowing banks to buy or sell securitized assets might broach
that line and bring securities firms into the fray.
   "Deregulation is happening faster than the banks
themselves can adjust," says James Russell, a Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. analyst here. "And there already is a lot more risk in
the system as a result."
