   Your April 18 editorial "Lawmakers for Life" was on the
mark. If the principle underlying the American system of
government could be summed up in a single sentence, it would
be Lord Acton's: "Power corrupts." The S&amp;L scandal alone is
reason enough to limit the power of our Imperial Congress.
   I serve on the board of Americans to Limit Congressional
Terms, and heartily endorse its efforts. But many state
legislators who agree in principle with term limits are
reluctant to embrace the ALCT's initiative because of the
dangers, real and imagined, of a "runaway" Constitutional
Convention.

   In Colorado, we're trying a different approach. Coloradans
to Limit Terms is attempting to put on the November ballot an
amendment to our state constitution to limit Colorado's U.S.
senators and representatives to 12 consecutive years in the
same office, and to limit the governor, state executive
officers and state legislators to eight consecutive years in
the same office.
   Term limits have been endorsed by two of the three
candidates for the U.S. Senate in Colorado this year --
Republican Rep. Hank Brown and Democrats Carlos Lucero and
Josie Heath -- and by all three candidates for the House seat
Rep. Brown is vacating.
   We're trying to bring about federal term limits in much
the same way earlier Progressives obtained direct election of
U.S. senators. The Congress then was as reluctant as the
Congress now to reform. But Colorado and other progressive
states passed laws requiring the legislature to select the
Senate candidate who had won a popular election. Eventually,
Congress bowed to the inevitable and ratified de jure what
was already de facto the practice in much of the country.
   If other states were to follow the Colorado approach, we
could bring about federal term limits without the need to
call a Constitutional Convention.
