   Hasbro Inc., Pawtucket, R.I., said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that it no longer has voting
control over Time Warner Inc.'s 10 million-share stake in the
company. But Hasbro said it continues to retain rights of
first refusal to buy the shares until 1993, if Time Warner
wants to sell them.
   The filing said a May 1983, shareholder rights agreement
with Warner Communications expired, as expected. The
agreement had given Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman, and Barry
Alperin, co-chief operating officer, voting control over the
Time Warner unit's 17.4% stake.

   Analysts said the change in voting control would probably
have little effect on Hasbro. "Hasbro is in excellent
financial shape and has the resources to buy these shares
back if it wants to," said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. He added that "there's no indication
that Alan Hassenfeld wants to give up control of the
company."
   A Time Warner spokesman said the company would have no
comment on whether it has any plans to dispose of its Hasbro
stake.
