   TORONTO -- Shareholders approved the merger of two
investment dealers, Walwyn Inc., and Midland Doherty
Financial Corp., which is 31%-owned by Union Enterprises Inc.
   The new concern created by the merger, which takes effect
Friday, will be named Midland Walwyn Inc. Union Enterprises
will retain an 11.5% interest, while Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. will have a 14.7% stake and Mackenzie Financial
Corp. will own 26.4%.

   Fairfax is a financial-services holding concern with
principal interests in the insurance business. It currently
owns 40.2% of Walwyn. Mackenzie Financial is one of Canada's
largest mutual fund managers. As part of the amalgamation of
Midland and Walywn, Mackenzie purchased seven million Walwyn
treasury shares for an aggregate price of 19.6 million
Canadian dollars (US$16.6 million).
   In the amalgamation, shareholders will receive one share
of Midland Walwyn for every 3.5 Walwyn shares held, or one
Midland Walwyn share for every two Midland shares held.
   Midland Walwyn will have a total of about 1,700 employees,
including about 700 registered representatives. H. Anthony
Arrell, who will be chairman and chief executive officer of
the new concern, said he expects it to be profitable in its
first 12 months of operation. Its latest quarter ending June
30, however, will include a C$30 million charge stemming from
costs of the merger. Both Walwyn and Midland had losses last
year.
   Two powerful Bay street players will continue to have
interests in the new investment dealer. Hees International
Bancorp, a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers
Peter and Edward Bronfman, will have an indirect interest
through its 22% stake in Unicorp Canada Corp., which controls
Union Enterprises. Gordon Capital Corp., an aggressive
investment dealer, will have a more than C$20 million stake
in Midland Walywn through its holding of Midland Doherty
debentures.
   James Moir, outgoing president of Midland Doherty, told
the Midland Doherty annual meeting that the merger would give
the two securities dealers the economies of scale they need
to compete. In the last five years, Canada's five biggest
banks have acquired seven of the largest Canadian investment
dealers, while foreign concerns have bought four firms and
established 10 Canadian subsidiaries, he said.
