   Acton Corp., Raleigh, N.C., said it preliminarily agreed
to buy the furniture operations of High Point, N.C.-based
Hickory Furniture Co., a unit of closely held Telco Capital
Corp., Chicago, for $44.5 million.
   Acton is engaged in specialized auto insurance
underwriting, real estate development and the operation of a
cable-television system. Hickory, which has seven production
facilities in North Carolina, beneficially owns about 40% of
the common stock of Acton and controls about 76% of the
voting power of Acton's voting stock.

   The companies said the transaction was negotiated by
independent special committees of the Acton and Hickory
boards, each having their own counsel and outside advisers.
The transaction is subject, among other things, to a
definitive purchase agreement and the receipt by Acton's
special committee of an opinion from its investment adviser
that the price to be paid is fair to Acton shareholders,
other than Hickory. The deal is expected to close within the
next two weeks.
