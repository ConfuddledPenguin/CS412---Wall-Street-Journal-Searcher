   Bicoastal Corp. said it agreed to sell its Link-Miles
aviation subsidiary to Thomson-CSF for $100 million.
   Bicoastal, the troubled successor to Singer Co., filed for
creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code in November. The Tampa, Fla., company said
its agreement with Thomson-CSF -- a unit of Thomson S.A., the
French state-controlled defense and electronics group -- is
subject to receiving approvals from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
and from British and French governmental and regulatory
authorities.
