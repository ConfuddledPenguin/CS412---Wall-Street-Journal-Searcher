   NEW YORK -- Investors, emboldened by higher bond prices,
drove stocks sharply higher, but trading was lackluster in
both markets.
   The industrial average jumped 49.57 points to close at
2870.49, a new record, and more than erasing Friday's
34.63-point slump on even thinner trading. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index also closed at a new record -- 360.65, up
6.07 -- for the first time since last October.

   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose more than a half
point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. The dollar was
mixed.
   A major factor in the Friday stock-market plunge was a
scare of big earnings disappointments lurking in technology
stocks. But yesterday the profit goblins vanished and shares
of International Business Machines led the advance.
   Late Thursday, software maker Adobe Systems said it would
earn less than expected because of slower orders from such
customers as Apple and IBM. The announcement unleashed a run
on technology stocks Friday, including IBM. "The Adobe
Systems debacle on Friday provided traders an excuse to sell,
but was not a harbinger of any fundamental problem besetting
the industry," said A.C. Moore, research director at Argus
Research.
   Adding to stock investors' zeal for IBM and other
technology issues yesterday was a positive story about the
computer giant in Barron's magazine. "IBM has reasserted
itself as the bell cow of the market," much as it was in the
early 1980s, said Mr. Moore. "IBM would have rebounded
without the Barron's article," but perhaps not as much as its
3 1/2-point gain to 119 3/4.
   While volume was limp, the breadth of the advance
encouraged analysts. On the New York Stock Exchange,
advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,107 to 434.
   "Any time you get advancers of over 1,000, it indicates
it's not just program activity," said Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers.
In addition, he noted that the volume of shares rising in
price swamped trading in declining stocks by 5 to 1. He said
that ratio suggests strong buying by institutional investors,
not just computer-assisted program trades in baskets of
blue-chip stocks.
   Peter Canelo, chief strategist at Bear Stearns, says he
isn't surprised by the stock market's buoyancy. He thinks
price-earnings ratios are in line, suggesting the stock
market isn't overvalued. "The competitive allure of bonds is
not overwhelming," he asserted.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose sharply in light trading, with 137.4
million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.62%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6740 marks and 151.25 yen, compared
with 1.6824 West German marks and 149.40 Japanese yen Friday.
