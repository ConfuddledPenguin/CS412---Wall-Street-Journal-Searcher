   NEW YORK -- The bond market recovered from Friday's slump
as a light wave of bullish sentiment buoyed prices.
   Traders said investors returned from the long Memorial Day
weekend in a relatively good mood after focusing on numerous
positive technical and fundamental indicators. Many of these
indicators, such as sluggish money supply growth and falling
commodity prices, have fueled perceptions that the economy is
growing weaker and that interest rates will eventually fall.

   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about 1/2 point,
a gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
advance about offset Friday's loss when the 30-year bond fell
5/8 point. Financial markets were closed Monday.
   Dealers said bond prices began to rise in early trading as
the value of the dollar rose against the yen in foreign
exchange markets. Michael Moore, manager of government
trading at Continental Bank, said the dollar "set a favorable
tone for the bond market" that lasted all day.
   In addition, economists and traders said investors were
heartened by recent trends in the money supply, which has
been growing more slowly.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bank Corp.,
said the slow growth in the nation's money supply "portends
continued sluggish economic activity and lower inflation" for
several months. If the money supply continues to grow at the
current slow pace, Mr. Levy believes the Federal Reserve may
be forced to eventually cut interest rates in an effort to
stimulate the economy.
   Bond prices were also helped by perceptions that recent
declines in commodity prices will continue. The Commodity
Research Bureau's futures index, which includes 21
commodities and is viewed as an inflation gauge, fell 1.97
points to 244.33.
   Trading activity was quiet, which is normal for the week
when the potentially market-moving employment report is due
to be released. Trading often slows considerably ahead of the
jobs report, which is considered the most important economic
indicator released during the month.
   Given the bond market's preoccupation with the employment
data, which will provide the first look at how the economy
fared this month, today's reports on April leading indicators
and new home sales shouldn't have much impact on bond prices
unless they differ sharply from expectations, analysts said.
   Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
expect, on average, that the U.S. composite index of leading
indicators fell 0.2% and that new single-family home sales
slipped 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 572,000
from March's 574,000 annual rate.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 101 10/32 to yield
8.62%, compared with 100 25/32 to yield 8.66%. The latest
10-year notes ended at 101 15/32 to yield 8.63%, compared
with 101 5/32 to yield 8.68%.
   The Treasury sold a total of $16.8 billion of bills
yesterday at the government's regular weekly auction. The
average discount rate for three-month bills was 7.80%, and
the average rate for six-month bills was 7.74%. The rate on
three-month bills was up from last week's auction when it was
7.74%. The rate on six-month bills was down from last week's
auction when it was 7.79%.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were at their session
highs late yesterday.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for June delivery were up 5/32 at 98 7/32.
   The yield spread between the Ginnie Mae issue and the
Treasury 10-year note was unchanged from Friday at 1.25
percentage points.
   Trading was light throughout the day. Traders said that
despite taking on a large supply of derivative products last
week, the market appears ready to take on more supply.
   Ginnie Mae 9% securities were up 5/32 at 95 24/32, and the
10% securities were at 100 12/32, up 4/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 10% securities were up 4/32 at 99 26/32, as
were the 10 1/2% securities, at 101 14/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities were up 5/32 at 98
10/32. The 10% securities, at 100 11/32, were up 4/32.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Prices of R.H. Macy &amp; Co.'s recently battered junk bonds
stabilized after gyrating wildly last week.
   Macy's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, due in 2001, ended
little changed at 59, while the retailer's 14 1/2% senior
subordinated debentures, maturing in 1998, finished
unchanged, at 69.
   There was little trading in the retailer's bonds, and
market participants said activity in the broader high-yield
market was quiet as high-yield investors trickled back from
the holiday weekend.
   Macy's bonds plunged initially last week on news that some
lenders were tightening credit standards for the retailer.
The bonds managed to stage a partial rebound after the
retailer reported preliminary third-quarter results that
exceeded market expectations.
   Meanwhile, in the broader high-yield market, most junk
bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or
no credit ratings, ended unchanged.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded high-grade issues finished unchanged to about 1/8
point higher in very thin trading.
   Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the ratings for the senior and senior subordinated debt of
Memorex Telex Corp. to single-B-2 from single-B-1 and to
single-B-3 from single-B-2, respectively. The agency said
$1.2 billion of securities are affected.
   Moody's said it based its action "on the deteriorated
business outlook for the company caused by industrywide
aggressive pricing and warranty strategies, which are slowly
eroding the market niches for suppliers of plug-compatible
peripherals. Consequently, Memorex Telex' weak financial
measures are likely to continue over the intermediate term
and liquidity will be tight."
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Following the lead of Treasurys, municipal bonds were
unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher in late dealings.
   Despite the slight gains, traders expect little movement
in the market ahead of the release of May employment data
Friday.
   In new issue activity, a Dillon, Read &amp; Co. group priced
$132 million of Texas Turnpike Authority revenue bonds.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 rose 1/4 point to 97 7/8 to
yield 7.38%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Profit-taking and a decline in the value of the yen pushed
Japanese government bond prices lower.
   The selling began at the start of trading and continued
throughout the day. "People were trading {bonds} while
watching the foreign exchange market," said a trader at one
of Japan's major banks.
   Dealers said expectations that short-term rates aren't
likely to fall anytime soon added to the bearish tone of
trading and prompted some investors to take profits. Rates on
new three-month certificates of deposit ended unchanged at
about 7.4%.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's
benchmark 10-year issue was quoted at a price of 87.89, down
0.62 point, to yield 6.99%. The yield opened in
over-the-counter trading at a low of 6.835% and ranged as
high as 7.02%. (Japanese yields are stated in local terms,
but they would be lower if calculated by the semiannual
compound measure used in the U.S.)
