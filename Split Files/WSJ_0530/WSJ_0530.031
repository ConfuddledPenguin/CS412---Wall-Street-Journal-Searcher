   MILAN -- Italy's foreign trade account deficit narrowed to
a provisional, seasonally unadjusted 877 billion lire ($710.1
million) in April from gaps of 1.686 trillion lire a year
earlier and 3.25 trillion lire in the previous month, Istat,
the state statistical office, said.
   For this year's first four months, the trade balance
showed a deficit of 10.014 trillion lire, narrowed from a
11.324 trillion-lira gap a year earlier. These data also are
preliminary and aren't seasonally adjusted.
