   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether
federal officials may prohibit federally funded family
planning clinics from counseling women about abortion or
providing referral information.
   The justices will review a November ruling by a federal
appeals court in New York that upheld the abortion counseling
prohibition adopted in 1988 by the Reagan administration.

   The case, which will be argued in the fall and probably
decided next spring, provides the justices with a vehicle for
further restricting abortion rights, a direction favored by a
majority of the court. But Rachael Pine, an American Civil
Liberties Union attorney for those challenging the
regulations, said, "it is pretty much unimaginable" that the
court would use the case to overrule the right to abortion.
   Prior to 1988, federal regulations that were adopted to
implement Title X of the Public Health Services Act allowed
federally funded clinics to provide abortion counseling and
referral information, although the clinics were barred from
performing abortions.
   But the Reagan administration issued regulations that
require family planning centers to refrain from providing
abortion counseling or giving referrals; to maintain
completely separate records, facilities and personnel if
centers operate abortion clinics; and to abstain from
lobbying or filing lawsuits to protect the right to abortion.
   The Title X program costs about $200 million annually and
funds more than 4,000 centers that provide family planning
and other reproductive health care to an estimated five
million low-income women.
   The new regulations were challenged in a number of courts
by a variety of medical groups, individual doctors and local
Planned Parenthood chapters, which operate family planning
centers and, in some instances, also run separate abortion
clinics that aren't federally funded.
   Due to federal court injunctions, the regulations haven't
been fully implemented, although they may have taken effect
in a few places, according to Ms. Pine.
   In the case the high court agreed to hear, Planned
Parenthood of New York City Inc., Medical and Health Research
Association of New York City, and the state of New York all
challenged the regulations. They argued that the regulations
were inconsistent with federal law, infringed on the
constitutional right to abortion, and violated the First
Amendment free-speech rights of doctors to counsel their
patients. The appeals court rejected all of the arguments but
stayed enforcement of the regulations while the case was
being appealed.
   A federal appeals court in Boston ruled in March that the
same regulations are unconstitutional. That ruling made it
almost certain the high court would hear the New York appeal,
the first to arrive at the court, to resolve the conflicting
appeals court views.
   The Bush administration urged the high court to hear the
New York case and said that it will defend the regulations.
