   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that Massachusetts can't prohibit
securities firms from requiring customers to sign arbitration
agreements.
   The decision is a victory for the securities industry,
which challenged the Massachusetts regulations soon after
they were adopted by the Massachusetts secretary of state in
September 1988. The regulations were challenged by the
Securities Industry Association, a trade group, and by 10
major brokerage firms.

   The rules required securities brokers to disclose to
customers the effects of standard arbitration agreements, and
they barred brokers from insisting that customers sign such
agreements to open accounts, which is standard practice in
the industry.
   Last August, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that
the Massachusetts rules conflict with the Federal Arbitration
Act and, therefore, are unconstitutional. The appeals court
said that federal law prohibits a state from singling out
securities arbitration agreements for tougher regulation than
other business contracts.
   "The long and short of it is that we can find no evidence
of a clear congressional command to override the unambiguous
pro-arbitration mandate of the Federal Arbitration Act in the
securities field," the appeals court said.
   The appeals court affirmed the December 1988 order of a
federal district judge in Boston who blocked the state from
enforcing the regulations. The state appealed to the high
court, which, without comment, refused to hear the case.
   Thirty other states joined in a friend-of-the-court brief
supporting Massachusetts' appeal. They argued that the effect
of the appeals court ruling "is to leave the states powerless
to protect consumers from being coerced to enter arbitration
agreements."
   But the Bush administration countered in a brief that the
appeals court decision "will not effectively undermine state
and federal regulatory efforts to police securities
arbitration provisions." (Connolly vs. Securities Industry
Association)
                                                                                                       

   Bank Liability
                                                                                                       

   The justices ruled, 8-1, that a federal appeals court in
New York should reconsider its decision that U.S. banks are
liable for deposits made in overseas branches that are
restricted by the actions of foreign governments.
   The high court's action left some issues unsettled, but
the decision was a victory for Citicorp's Citibank unit, and
for New York's other leading commercial banks.
   In July 1988, the appeals court found Citibank in New York
liable to a Wells Fargo &amp; Co. unit for $1,066,000, for
deposits made to a Citibank branch in Manila, Philippines.
The Manila branch was unable to repay the deposits, made in
U.S. dollars by Wells Fargo Asia Ltd., because of economic
regulations issued by the Philippine government in 1983 to
stop the flow of dollars out of the country.
   The appeals court ruled that it was proper to make
Citibank liable in New York because the funds were
transferred through New York accounts of both Wells Fargo
Asia and Citibank/Manila. The appeals court said there was an
agreement between the two banks to permit collection in New
York.
   The New York Clearing House, a trade group of 12 leading
commercial banks, warned in a friend-of-the-court brief that
the appeals court ruling "calls into question the legal
status of hundreds of billions of dollars of offshore
deposits." The brief noted that the transfer between Wells
Fargo and Citibank was handled through a standard
international, electronic payment system. The Bush
administration also said the appeals court was wrong.
   The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Associate
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, noted that the district court
didn't find an agreement that allowed Wells Fargo Asia to
collect the deposits in New York. The court said there was no
evidence that standard computer confirmation messages, used
in international banking, create agreements to make New York
banks liable for their overseas branches.
   The court ordered the appeals court to decide whether, in
the absence of an agreement, Citibank could still be held
liable under New York state, federal or Philippine law.
   John Warden, attorney for the New York Clearing House,
said the decision "is very helpful" because it makes clear
that the system of international electronic payments doesn't
create world-wide liability on the part of New York banks.
   Associate Justice John Paul Stevens III dissented.

   Chapter 11 Taxes
                                                                                                       

   The high court ruled, 8-1, that federal bankruptcy judges
may order the Internal Revenue Service to treat tax payments
made by a company in Chapter 11 reorganization as
contributions to employee income taxes and Social Security
withholding, rather than paying off the company's own
income-tax bill.
   The decision, written by Associate Justice Byron R. White,
is a defeat for the IRS. Unpaid contributions to employee tax
withholding accounts become the liability of a company's
officers. The IRS argued that allowing the company in Chapter
11 to pay withholding taxes ahead of its own income taxes
would allow corporate officers to shirk their
responsibilities at government expense. Associate Justice
Harry A. Blackmun dissented.
   The case involved two Rhode Island companies in Chapter 11
proceedings, Energy Resources Co. and Newport Offshore Ltd.
(U.S. vs. Energy Resources Co.)
                                                                                                       

   Retaliatory Taxes
                                                                                                       

   The justices agreed to decide whether an individual who
challenges a state tax as interfering with interstate
commerce may use a federal civil-rights law that allows those
who sue successfully to have the losers pay their legal
expenses and attorneys' fees. The justices will hear an
appeal by an Ohio trucker. He challenged a Nebraska
"retaliatory tax" imposed on truckers that do business in
Nebraska but are registered in other states that levy similar
taxes on vehicles registered in Nebraska. (Dennis vs.
