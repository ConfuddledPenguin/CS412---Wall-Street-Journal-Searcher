   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union will make
higher wages its top demand in this summer's contract
negotiations with the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three
auto makers, Robert White, CAW president, said.
   The Canadian union's bargaining plank contrasts with that
of the United Auto Workers in the U.S., which last week said
it would demand practically unconditional job security in its
contract talks. Both unions' contracts with General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and their Canadian
units are due to expire Sept. 14.

   Mr. White, speaking at the opening of the CAW's convention
to set bargaining goals, said the union, which represents
65,000 auto workers in Canada, also will seek improvements in
cost-of-living adjustments and income maintenance schemes for
laid-off workers. Job security, which Mr. White said
ultimately cannot be guaranteed, will be addressed indirectly
through such demands as reduced work hours.
   "We shouldn't fool our members. If (auto) sales drop off .
. . I don't know how you can get job security," Mr. White
said. The CAW official said he doesn't mean to criticize the
UAW's demanding job security, but said "philosophical"
differences continued to divide the two unions. The CAW split
from its U.S. counterpart in 1985.
   The CAW also won't be pressing for greater worker
involvement in corporate decisions, one of the main demands
that will be made by the U.S. union. In a policy document,
the CAW says management-worker team concepts often are used
by management "to replace worker solidarity with total
identification with the goals of the company."
   In 1987, the CAW concluded contract agreements, which for
the first time included an inflation-pegged indexing system
for pensioners, after a six-day strike at Chrysler's Canadian
subsidiary.
