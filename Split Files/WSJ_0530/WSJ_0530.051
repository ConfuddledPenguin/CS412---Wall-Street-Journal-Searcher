   MORE TREES FOR BRAZIL?

   Brazilian scientists drew up a $20 billion plan to help
combat global warming by planting about 10 billion trees.
They calculate the trees would absorb 5% of the atmosphere's
carbon dioxide -- the central villain in the "greenhouse
effect."
   The project, which has the backing of Brazil's
pulp-and-paper industry, was conceived by scholars at Sao
Paulo University's Institute of Advanced Studies.
   Prof. Aziz Ab'Saber, one of the project's architects, said
the plan is intended to provide raw material for Brazil's
paper-and-pulp industry, fight global warming and improve the
local environment.
   Brazil is seeking international funding. But with the
country already heavily indebted to foreign lenders, it may
be difficult to raise more funds.
                                                                                                       

   TURNING SCRAP TO GOLD
                                                                                                       

   Scientists emigrating from the Soviet Union to Israel are
living an alchemist's dream: turning scrap metal into gold,
silver and platinum. Officials of Satec, a firm set up in
1987, say a ton of worn-out printed circuit boards can be
turned into 10 to 28 ounces of pure gold in hours, at about
half the price of other processes. Soviet immigrant Herman
Branover set up Satec after a Brooklyn rabbi urged more jobs
for Soviet scientists in Israel. Satec will funnel expected
profit to jobs and homes for other immigrants.
                                                                                                       

   EC-JAPAN TACKLE TRADE
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission and Japan will set up a
"working group" aimed at reducing trade barriers between two
of the world's largest trading partners. The accord, reached
during the first ministerial-level meeting between Japan and
the EC Commission in 3 1/2 years, is mainly aimed at finding
ways to reduce the EC's persistent $20 billion trade deficit
with Japan. The two sides also agreed to expand a program to
promote EC exports to Japan.
                                                                                                       

   HUNGARIAN FIRM LOOKS WEST
                                                                                                       

   Ibusz Rt., the Hungarian state-owned travel company, set
its share price at 4,900 Hungarian forints ($75.79) a share
in its planned flotation of 40% of its stock on the Budapest
and Vienna stock exchanges next month. Ibusz will be the
first major privatization of an East bloc company on a
Western stock exchange. Ibusz will sell to private investors
440,000 shares, half of which are targeted for foreigners. An
additional 40,000 shares will be offered to employees in a
private placement. Ibusz posted 1989 pretax profit of 1.1
billion forints.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET BUSINESS WEEKLY IN U.S.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. edition of a private Soviet business weekly
debuts this week. The paper, Commersant, began publication in
Russian and English in January. It has a Soviet circulation
of 350,000, and the Soviet-American edition is expected to
attract up to 60,000 subscribers at an introductory $165 a
year. Created by Vladimir Yakovlev, Commersant covers topics
such as joint ventures, the unofficial dollar exchange rate
and Soviet government decisions affecting business. It
advises readers on starting a business, where it is risky to
invest, how to attract foreign capital and how to invest
rubles.
                                                                                                       

   CANON'S OFFSHORE MOVE
                                                                                                       

   Canon Inc. is considering shifting all the company's
compact-camera production from Japan to China, Taiwan, and
Malaysia by 1992, because of a serious labor shortage in
Japan, a spokesman confirmed. Production of compact cameras
in the three Asian countries is expected to surpass four
million units a year by 1992. Canon, Japan's leading maker of
cameras and office automation equipment, currently
manufactures three million compact cameras a year in Japan
and Taiwan.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE RULERS' FALL PREDICTED
                                                                                                       

   Former U.S. presidential adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski
predicted the fall of China's Communist government.
   At a private seminar in Tokyo, Mr. Brzezinski, who was
national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said:
"The existing Chinese regime is on its last legs, and it
probably will not endure beyond two to four years."
   Mr. Brzezinski, noting that Communism has proven to be
"historically a grand failure," said the irreversible
collapse of the Communist systems in Eastern Europe "poses
the growing likelihood that the temporarily frozen political
system of China will before too long erupt into renewed
turbulence."
   But Mr. Brzezinski said China shouldn't be isolated. "With
the waning of the Cold War, we will have to facilitate the
entry of China into a more cooperative global community," he
said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A Vancouver, Canada, school-board committee approved
installing condom-dispensing machines in bathrooms at the
city's 18 high schools to help students protect themselves
from AIDS. . . . An ancient murrelet is drawing hundreds of
birdwatchers to the Bristol Channel in southwest England. The
small diving bird "has never been recorded outside the
northern Pacific Ocean before; its appearance in Britain is
likely to be the bird sighting of 1990," said Richard
Millington, who runs a rare-bird information service.
