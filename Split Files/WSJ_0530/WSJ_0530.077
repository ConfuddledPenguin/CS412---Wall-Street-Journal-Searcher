   Focused Psychotherapy
   Shrinks Medical Bills

   CONSIDER the diabetic telephone lineman who really wanted
to be a journalist and piled up huge medical bills as a
result.
   A plot-line for the TV show "Twin Peaks"? No, it's an
example that Biodyne Institute, South San Francisco, Calif.,
uses to support its position that short-term mental health
treatment can shrink long-term health costs.
   In a four-year study, the research firm found that annual
medical costs fell about 35% among patients who had a few
sessions of "focused" psychotherapy. For those who had
traditional psychotherapy or no mental health care, changes
in medical costs ranged from slight declines to 25%
increases. Targeted treatment proved most cost-effective
among diabetics and other chronically ill patients, who
consume a disproportionate share of healthcare resources. The
study of 44,663 Medicaid patients and U.S. employees in
Hawaii was funded by the U.S. Health Care Finance
Administration.
   Focused therapy treats specific complaints over a period
limited to several weeks, says Nicholas Cummings, a
psychologist who's chairman and president of Biodyne.
Traditional psychotherapy regards such complaints as symptoms
of broader problems; treatment is usually open-ended and
lately a target of health-care cost-cutters.
   As for the lineman, he became depressed, couldn't climb
telephone poles and refused to maintain regular insulin
treatments. Every two weeks, he ended up in an emergency room
in a diabetic coma. His medical bills soared.
   Diagnosis: He hated his job. Eight weeks of therapy failed
to cure him of journalistic yearnings, but it helped him
accept a compromise -- a job as a proofreader in a publishing
company. He resumed consistent insulin injections, his
depression went away and his medical bills plunged, Mr.
Cummings says.
   Biodyne is not-for-profit, but Mr. Cummings is also chief
executive officer of American Biodyne Inc., which provides
mental health services based on the Hawaii study in several
states. The company projects that revenue will more than
double to $27 million in the year ending Sept. 30.
                                                                                                       

   High-Tech Diagnostics
   Aren't the Only Culprit
                                                                                                       

   MAGNETIC resonance aging and coronary angiography are
among the high-tech tests that take much of the blame for
unnecessary costs in medical diagnosis. But some low-tech
tests waste money, too.
   When hospital patients develop diarrhea, doctors commonly
order stool tests to look for bacteria such as salmonella
that might cause food poisoning or similar digestive
distress. But for patients already hospitalized at least
three days, these tests almost never find the cause of the
problem.
   University of Pennsylvania Hospital researchers found that
in a study of 3,387 samples checked for bacteria or
parasites, all 76 positive tests were from outpatients or
from those tested within three days of admission. Yet nearly
half the samples were from patients first tested after their
third day in the hospital.
   "Such practices misuse hospital and laboratory resources
at a time when cost containment must be considered a
priority," say the researchers in a recent issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association. Hospital labs
did about four million such tests in 1988. Eliminating 30% to
50% of them would save $20 million to $30 million in annual
hospital expenses, the researchers say.
                                                                                                       

   Mass Cholesterol Tests
   Work on Wall Street
                                                                                                       

   WORKPLACE cholesterol screening programs -- already
popular -- get a new boost from a report that shows they
work.
   A program among 886 workers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. not
only succeeded in lowering cholesterol levels, but also
appeared to reduce overall heart-disease risk for many
participants.
   In initial 15-minute sessions, nurses measured cholesterol
levels with fingerstick tests and recorded blood pressure,
height and weight while awaiting the results. They also gave
participants pep talks on ways to change unhealthy habits.
   The tests showed that 411 employees, or 47%, had high or
borderline-high cholesterol. About 275 returned for a
six-month followup. Their cholesterol levels fell an average
of 8.3%, according to the report in the May issue of Archives
of Internal Medicine. There were other benefits. "If you do a
little counseling with the screening, people will make
significant changes in diet, weight, exercise and smoking,"
says Donald H. Gemson, a professor at Columbia University's
School of Public Health in New York.
   Dr. Gemson and the other researchers didn't do a cost
analysis of the program, but large-scale screenings, run by
nurses rather than physicians, are much less expensive than
individual blood tests sent to labs for analysis and
interpreted by doctors, he says.
   Another plus: "It's very popular with employees," Dr.
Gemson says. "They don't have to go to private doctors and
spend money out-of-pocket."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SEVEN of 10 employees believe their employers should
provide health benefits for their families, but nine of 10
employers say they plan to reduce or eliminate coverage.
These findings in surveys conducted for Northwestern National
Life Insurance Co., Minneapolis, point to growing conflict
over benefits, the insurer says. . . . Uninsured women spend
an average of 1.9 days in the hospital for routine
childbirth, while those with traditional insurance spend 2.3
days, says Healthcare Knowledge Systems, Ann Arbor, Mich.
