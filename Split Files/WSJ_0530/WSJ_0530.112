   UAL Corp.'s unions have held talks with Gerald Greenwald,
vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., about taking the top job at
United Airlines if an employee buy-out succeeds, people
familiar with the situation said.
   It couldn't immediately be determined whether Mr.
Greenwald, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca's heir apparent,
is seriously interested in any UAL union offer.

   As recently as last week, Mr. Greenwald, 54 years old,
said through a spokesman that "there's nothing to" the rumors
that he plans to join the UAL buy-out effort.
   However, one person familiar with the situation indicated
late yesterday that talks were continuing in the union effort
to recruit Mr. Greenwald and that more meetings remained to
be held. "There are hurdles that have to be overcome," the
person said.
   Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached yesterday. The Chrysler
spokesman said he doesn't know of any change in Mr.
Greenwald's earlier position.
   Several people familiar with the UAL buy-out effort said
the unions are close to concluding their search for a
chairman. The labor group needs to show it has a strong
candidate to succeed UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf in order to
line up bank financing for the $4.38 billion transaction
proposed in April.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Greenwald is the unions'
leading choice. An executive search firm handling the effort
has talked with dozens of potential candidates. The unions
have ruled out many of them, and others took themselves out
of the running.
   Most of the candidates who have figured in previous
speculation about the UAL post have come from the airline
industry. But none of that industry's top executives seemed
willing to take the risk of accepting a job that may not
materialize.
   The union's new strategy, according to some people
familiar with the situation, is to recruit a chairman from
outside the airline industry who could command the respect of
the financial community. A No. 2 executive could come from
within the industry to run the airline.
   The unions are also anxious to show they are making
progress, particularly because an earlier labor-management
buy-out effort collapsed. Last week, the labor group signed
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help in the financing effort. The
group has until Aug. 9 to arrange financing under an
agreement with the board of Chicago-based UAL.
   Union officials believe Mr. Greenwald would lend
considerable weight to the employee effort. During the early
1980s, Mr. Greenwald, who joined Chrysler from Ford Motor Co.
in 1979, was one of the main architects of Chrysler's
recovery from near bankruptcy.
   The timing of the rumors about Mr. Greenwald is
unfortunate for Highland Park, Mich-based Chrysler, however.
Two weeks ago, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's vice president of
international operations resigned to take a top job at Black
&amp; Decker Corp. Last week, the company confirmed that its
treasurer plans to leave. One top Chrysler executive said
yesterday that these departures are "an unfortunate
coincidence of individual decisions."
   In 1988, Mr. Greenwald was named vice chairman and a
member with Mr. Iacocca, of the Office of the Chairman. At
the time, Chrysler said the move "paves the way for an
orderly succession" when Mr. Iacocca retires.
   But the date of Mr. Iacocca's retirement is uncertain,
which is perhaps why Mr. Greenwald at least listened to the
approach from UAL unions. In 1987, Mr. Iacocca signed a
contract with Chrysler that expires at the end of 1991. But
at recent appearances in Chicago and Los Angeles, Mr.
Iacocca, who is 65 years old, has said he hasn't made up his
mind yet exactly when he will leave.
