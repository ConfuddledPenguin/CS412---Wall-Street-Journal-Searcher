   MILAN -- Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. reported that 1989
consolidated net profit after minority interests fell 45% to
311 billion lire ($251.8 million) from 561 billion lire the
year earlier.
   Ferruzzi Finanziaria, Italy's leading agro-industrial
group, attributed the decline to the extraordinary loss of
$128.7 million incurred by its soybean trading division last
summer. Ferruzzi also said the result reflected a higher
corporate tax rate and radical changes in the group's
structure following the transfer of chemical assets to
Enimont S.p.A. last year.

   Ferruzzi also announced plans to buy back as much as 150
billion lire of its shares.
   Because of the radical changes in the group's structure
following the foundation of Enimont last year, Ferruzzi said
it restated 1988 results to enable a comparison with last
year's earnings figures. Montedison, which is controlled by
the Ferruzzi group through Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria
S.p.A., ceded the bulk of its chemical activities to Enimont
last year.
   The earnings announcement also was the first time the
company revealed the full impact of its clash with the
Chicago Board of Trade last summer over its accumulation of
soybean contracts, although Ferruzzi had predicted in
September the loss would amount to about $100 million.
Ferruzzi was forced to sell off futures contracts totaling
some 23 million bushels of soybeans.
