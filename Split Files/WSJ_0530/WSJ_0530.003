   WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked the
special prosecutor investigating former Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce to examine new allegations of political
favoritism at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   The request by Mr. Thornburgh, whose initial
recommendation for an investigation was narrowly drawn, came
in response to testimony before a House subcommittee by
DuBois Gilliam, a former Pierce deputy. Mr. Gilliam, who is
serving an 18-month prison sentence for accepting illegal
gratuities, told the subcommittee that Mr. Pierce had
instructed him several times to award grants to projects tied
to powerful Republicans. Mr. Gilliam also testified about
alleged kickbacks paid to HUD officials by developers seeking
favorable treatment.

   Mr. Thornburgh's latest request came in a letter to the
court-appointed special prosecutor, Arlin Adams, asking him
to expand his inquiry to include the new allegations of
favoritism in grants from Mr. Pierce's discretionary fund and
from another HUD urban development program.
   A number of lawmakers from both parties had urged a
broader investigation following Mr. Gilliam's testimony. But
Mr. Pierce's lawyers have challenged Mr. Gilliam's
credibility, given his criminal conviction.
   "Mr. Pierce has done nothing wrong," Paul Perito, a Pierce
attorney, said yesterday. "We have nothing to fear by an
impartial review of scurrilous allegations of Gilliam by a
group of dedicated and responsible prosecutors as opposed to
the hysteria and insatiable thirst for publicity of a
congressional inquiry gone awry."
   Mr. Adams is expected to follow the attorney general's
suggestion. In a brief prepared statement yesterday he said
that "in light of the Gilliam testimony, it may be
appropriate to redefine the mandate of the independent
counsel," which is the formal name for Mr. Adams's office. "I
shall, of course, carefully consider this letter from the
attorney general during the next few days and take action
promptly," Mr. Adams added.
