   TORONTO -- Development of 35 acres of prime downtown land
owned by the real estate unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. could
be delayed by the city council's order to review existing
zoning plans for the area.
   Canadian Pacific's Marathon Realty Co. said it "will
pursue whatever means are available" to uphold its rights to
develop the block of land, which is only steps from Toronto's
financial district. A move by the city to reduce the amount
of commercial development currently permitted on Marathon's
site could significantly lower the property's value.

   The conflict with City Hall comes when Canadian Pacific is
due to spin off 80% of Marathon to its shareholders. Canadian
Pacific is awaiting court approval of the spinoff.
   Although Marathon officials are concerned about what they
see as a breach of faith by City Hall over planning
regulations, they downplay the effects the controversy will
have on Marathon's operations as a public concern.
   "A delay in one project doesn't fundamentally affect the
viability of the company," said John Beales, Marathon's
senior vice president, buildings.
   Marathon plans to build up to six million square feet of
office space on the site over the next 10 to 15 years. A 3/4
acre piece of land adjacent to the Marathon holding is
reported to have sold recently for more than 240 million
Canadian dollars (US$203 million). Brad Smith, analyst with
Toronto-based Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., said the 35-acre
block owned by Marathon represents about 20% of the company's
net asset value. The property is part of a 200-acre section
of a rail corridor that surrounds the central train station.
