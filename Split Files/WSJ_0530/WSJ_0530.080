   NEW YORK -- If you thought the bad news at Xerox was over,
think again.
   Analysts and insurance-industry executives say Xerox faces
new write-offs at its Crum &amp; Forster insurance unit that
ultimately could rival the $400 million charge that Xerox
took in the first quarter to reflect deepening problems at
VMS Realty Partners, a partnership promoter in which Xerox
owns a 25% stake.

   Leading the list of potential troubles this time is Crum &amp;
Forster's bread-and-butter property-casualty insurance
business, whose results have been hurt by cyclical
price-cutting. Xerox has said its operating profit this year
will be less than last year's because of weakness at Crum &amp;
Forster. But at least one analyst believes the troubles are
deeper than the company's mild statement would indicate.
   "We suspect Xerox will need to strengthen reserves before
the year is out, probably to the tune of $150 million to $200
million," says B. Alex Henderson, a Prudential-Bache
Securities analyst. Reserves, which are funds set aside to
make future claims payments, are deducted from earnings, and
a boost of that size would cost Xerox about $1 to $1.50 a
share after taxes.
   Mr. Henderson isn't the only observer worried about Crum &amp;
Forster's reserves. Moody's Investors Service cited concerns
about Crum &amp; Forster's reserves and its "below-average
profitability prospects" in lowering the
insurance-financial-strength rating on Crum &amp; Forster to
single-A-2 from double-A-3 two weeks ago.
   In response to these concerns, a Xerox spokesman says, "We
believe our reserves are adequate at this time."
   However, that's what insurance companies always say, right
up until they boost reserves, as Crum &amp; Forster did in last
year's third quarter to the tune of $140 million.
   Another problem that could cost Crum &amp; Forster an
additional $100 million or more in write-offs is transactions
with other insurance companies known as reinsurers.
Reinsurance is insurance coverage that insurance companies
buy to reduce their risk of having to pay big claims. But if
the reinsurer runs into financial trouble and can't pay its
bills, the reinsurance becomes "unrecoverable," a euphemism
for worthless. The company that bought the reinsurance then
must pay the claims that it intended to pass along to the
reinsurer.
   Crum &amp; Forster buys a lot of reinsurance, particularly for
high-risk types of insurance such as legal and medical
malpractice. "We suspect Xerox has some exposure to some
European reinsurers that appear to be struggling," says
Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson. "It is possible some
reinsurance Xerox bought could become valueless."
   Some of it already may be valueless. Crum &amp; Forster was a
customer of several reinsurance companies owned by London
United Investments, a troubled British holding company whose
management was put under the control of two court-appointed
administrators last week, in a step similar to bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings in the U.S.
   A Xerox spokesman says Crum &amp; Forster was owed $147.1
million in reinsurance recoverable from various London United
subsidiaries and affiliates as of last Dec. 31. However, Mr.
Henderson and several insurance-industry executives believe
the amount that Xerox might ultimately have to write off as a
result of London United's troubles could increase as claims
continue to roll in from Crum &amp; Forster policies that were
reinsured with London United units.
   Xerox says it is waiting for an independent study of
London United to be completed before it takes any action.
"It's just too soon for us to speculate on what financial
impact this may have on Crum &amp; Forster," Stuart Ross,
chairman of Xerox Financial Services, says through a
spokesman.
   Whatever the final bill for London United's woes, it seems
unlikely that Crum &amp; Forster will be able to recover all of
the $147.1 million it already is owed. Therefore, it seems
likely that some of it will be written off.
   In the past, Xerox has been able to prevent reserve
increases or reinsurance write-offs from depressing net
income by taking capital gains from its investment portfolio.
Last year, for example, Crum &amp; Forster took $358.7 million of
capital gains, mostly from trading some of its $5.4 billion
bond portfolio.
   But this year, it will be much tougher for Xerox to take
such gains because the value of its bond portfolio has been
depressed by rising interest rates. At the end of the first
quarter, Xerox's portfolio had a paper loss of $282 million,
compared with a paper gain of $77 million at the end of last
year.
   The one bright spot at Xerox is the company's traditional
strength, its business-equipment sector. But even there lurks
an obvious but unquantifiable problem: Brazil.
   The new Brazilian government's Draconian austerity plan,
which is intended to bring long-term economic stability to
the country, may in the short term depress Xerox's earnings.
   Mr. Henderson of Prudential-Bache estimates that Brazilian
operations contributed 35 cents a share last year to Xerox's
earnings of $6.25 a share.
   Though Brazil's austerity measures began in March, they
weren't reflected at all in Xerox's first-quarter earnings
because Xerox closes the quarterly books on its foreign
operations a month early. The first hint of the Brazilian
problems will come in Xerox's second-quarter earnings, which
will include results of foreign operations for March, April
and May.
   Xerox declines to estimate the earnings impact of the
Brazilian measures, which include a price freeze. A Xerox
spokesman offers this assessment: "If prices remain frozen,
all we can say is we'll have a difficult year. Brazil is
likely to be a significant source of quarter-to-quarter
uncertainty through the balance of this year."
   Perhaps reflecting that uncertainty, analysts' estimates
of Xerox's operating earnings, excluding any special
write-offs, vary widely. Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch is
at the low end, forecasting earnings of $4 to $4.50 a share
this year and $4.50 to $5 a share next year. At the high end
is Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds, who is expecting
$5.80 this year and $6.70 next year. Mr. Henderson of
Prudential-Bache is forecasting $5 a share this year and
$5.65 next year.
