   Pic 'N' Save Corp. charged Girard Partners L.P. with
numerous violations of federal and state securities laws in
connection with Girard's attempt to gain control of Pic 'N'
Save's board.
   In a lawsuit filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, Pic 'N' Save accused Girard of making "false and
misleading statements" in certain regulatory filings, among
other violations.

   Pic 'N' Save, based in Dominguez, Calif., seeks to block
Girard's solicitation of shareholder consents and proxies and
to prohibit Girard from purchasing additional Pic 'N' Save
shares until the allegedly false statements are corrected.
The suit also asked the court to declare that all consents
and proxies obtained so far are void.
   In La Jolla, Calif., David H. Batchelder, Girard's
controlling partner, denied the allegations. "We believe the
suit is just a tactical maneuver to try and impede our
solicitations."
   Girard, which holds a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N' Save, is
trying to install five nominees on Pic 'N' Save's
seven-member board. Pic `N' Save, a discount retailer of
close-out merchandise, recently put itself up for sale in an
apparent attempt to convince investors that the incumbent
board is more dedicated than Girard in promoting shareholder
value.
