   LISLE, Ill. -- Molex Inc. said shareholders approved the
creation of a new class of nonvoting common stock, allowing
the company to issue new shares without diluting the voting
interest of existing stockholders.
   The maker of electrical and electronic equipment has about
24.9 million voting common shares outstanding -- about 47% in
the hands of the founding Krehbiel family -- and 94,255
shares of a separate Class B common stock, held only by the
Krehbiels. The Class B common votes separately.

   Following the shareholder vote, the company declared a
special dividend of one share of Class A nonvoting stock for
each common and Class B share, payable July 25 to stock of
record June 29. The voting and nonvoting shares will trade
separately, the company said.
   The plan means that holders, after the distribution, could
sell up to half their holdings and still retain their
original voting power. The move will "facilitate the Krehbiel
family's continued ownership of a substantial portion of the
company's voting stock," Molex said, and permit the company
to be managed "based on long-term objectives."
   In the event a party other than the Krehbiel family
acquires more than 50% of the voting common stock, all the
nonvoting shares automatically convert into voting shares.
Such a provision is aimed at ensuring that Class A holders
receive equal treatment in the event of any takeover, said an
official.
   Shareholders also authorized the company to issue up to
$25 million of a new class of "blank check" preferred stock;
the board has discretion to issue the stock under different
terms and conditions. Molex said it hasn't any current plans
to issue the new preferred.
   In addition, stockholders voted to approve certain "fair
price" measures designed to ensure that shareholders are
treated equally in the event of a takeover attempt, although
the company said it isn't aware of any current takeover
efforts.
   Molex boosted its quarterly dividend to one cent a share
from 0.8 cent, payable July 25 to stock of record June 29.
After the distribution of the nonvoting shares, the quarterly
payout will be one-half cent for all shares.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Molex closed at
$46.50, unchanged.
