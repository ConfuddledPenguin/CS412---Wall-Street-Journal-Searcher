   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -- Genentech Inc. said it asked the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a human clinical
test of a potential new drug against cystic fibrosis.
   Cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease that affects one in
every 2,500 babies born in the U.S., is marked by thick lung
secretions that often lead to respiratory failure and death
by age 28. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 young
people with the disease in this country.

   The experimental treatment is based upon a concept that
has been around since the 1950s. Decades ago, scientists
found that a certain cow enzyme could dissolve excess amounts
of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the lung secretions, making
them more liquid and easier to clear from the breathing
passages. But the cow enzyme provoked allergic reactions, and
never became standard treatment.
   The biotech firm said its scientists used gene-splicing
technology to insert the gene for the human form of this
enzyme into mammalian cells. The cells produce a purified
form of the human enzyme, called DNase. Genentech said few
allergic reactions are expected because the engineered enzyme
mimics the natural form already found in the human body.
   Genentech said it hopes to test DNase in an aerosolized
form in young adults with cystic fibrosis. After determining
its safety and appropriate dose levels, the company plans to
launch studies in younger children.
   If shown to be useful against cystic fibrosis, the drug
may be tested against other lung ailments, such as bacterial
pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, Genentech added.
