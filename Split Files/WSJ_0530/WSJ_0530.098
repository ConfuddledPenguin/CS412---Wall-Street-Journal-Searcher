   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. named
Allan S. Huston president of its international business, the
largest chain of restaurants abroad.
   Mr. Huston, 46 years old, was formerly senior vice
president, operations, at Pizza Hut, which, like Kentucky
Fried Chicken, is a unit of PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase,
N.Y.

   Mr. Huston succeeds Donald L. Pierce, 45, who resigned to
become president of Pentagram Corp., a restaurant operator in
Hawaii. Calling the Pentagram post a "unique opportunity,"
Mr. Pierce said he wanted to change jobs partly to cut down
on the amount of time he has spent traveling.
   Since 1988, when Mr. Pierce assumed his post, Kentucky
Fried Chicken's international business has had double-digit
earnings gains.
   Mr. Huston's appointment is the latest in a series of
high-level management changes at the chain. Since last
summer, the company, which has had a sluggish domestic
business, has appointed a new corporate president, a new top
marketing executive and new head for its U.S. business.
