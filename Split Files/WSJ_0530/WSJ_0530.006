   Junk mail may never be the same again. The people behind
all those bothersome fliers, catalogs and
you-may-have-already-won] sweepstakes are exploring a new way
to grab people at home: disposable videocassettes.
   Philmax, an Owings Mills, Md., firm, plans to start
producing inexpensive, cardboard videocassettes next month.
The cassettes aren't durable, wearing out after about 10
viewings, but Philmax says that makes them ideal for junk
mail pitches. Already, a credit card company and a health
care firm are planning to use the cardboard cassettes to send
informational videos to customers and potential customers,
Philmax says. Several other manufacturers are also working on
cheap videocassettes whose parts wear out after a few
viewings.

   The idea behind the inexpensive disposables "is basically
to replace direct mail. We think it's going to bring direct
mail into the video age," says Philip Brecher, a Philmax
co-owner. He envisions video catalogues and magazines, and
video versions of product instructions.
   If the disposable videocassettes catch on -- still a big
if -- they could immensely broaden the use of videocassette
premiums among advertisers. So far, most videocassette
promotions have revolved around videos people watch more than
once. National Football League videos of teams and bloopers
have been used as tie-ins with Sports Illustrated
subscriptions, Castrol motor oil, and Citibank Visa and
MasterCards. Burger King recently sold about seven million
copies of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle episodes in a promotion
tied to its kids' meals.
   The disposable videos, though, could broaden that range,
offering everything from political fund-raising pleas to
Cuisinart directions. "It isn't going to work for a Burger
King delivering seven million Ninja Turtle tapes, because
those are going to be watched over and over again," says Ira
Mayer, publisher and editor of Entertainment Marketing
Letter, a newsletter. But he says the tapes would be a
natural, for instance, for alcohol or cigarette companies:
"They're having a hard time as it is finding advertising
outlets. They might do something like this as a monthly
magazine."
   The disposables could compete with direct mail because
their cost would be relatively low. A mass mailing of a
typical plastic video costs about $3 apiece, including
postage. Philmax's cardboard videos could cost as little as
$1.15 apiece, including postage, Philmax says.
   Advertisers are studying the new technology with interest,
but most have yet to take the plunge. A Burger King
spokeswoman, for example, says the fast food chain is
"certainly aware of the disposables," but that it is
"premature for us to comment on the viability for Burger
King."
   And plenty of industry executives remain skeptical about a
cardboard videocassette, especially one that's been through
the mail. Philmax says its cassettes work 95% of the time,
even after being trampled on. In a test mailing of 200
cassettes, the failure rate was only about 2%, says Mr.
Brecher. But Entertainment Marketing's Mr. Mayer points out
that if the video looks handled when it arrives in the mail,
"I'm not sure that anybody -- myself included -- would want
to put that into their VCR." He also is skeptical about what
will happen if the mailed tape gets wet, and whether the tape
might get stuck in a VCR.
   A more practical problem for the manufacturers of
disposables, though, may be that the price of the real McCoy
has come down in many cases. Persona, a People-style video
magazine now being tested in Colorado and Indiana, costs
$4.95 -- and comes on a standard plastic videocassette which
can be re-used to record other programs. The price is held
down by advertising on the video magazine.
   "I don't want to reduce the secondary value we give to the
consumer, which is the ability to re-record over our
cassettes," says Charles-Terry Goldstein, chief executive
officer of Majestic Video Publishing, which publishes
Persona. He said he finds the idea of a cardboard video
"intriguing," but he has turned down manufacturers of cheap
tapes with parts made to wear out quickly. "The last thing
I'd want," he says, "is for someone to buy the thing, then
have it break down and feel they've gotten ripped off."

   BUY-BACK COMPLETED: Ammirati &amp; Puris, New York, said it
completed the buy-back of its stock from Omnicom Group.
Industry executives said the buy-back, which is tied to the
agency's future performance, could be worth more than $25
million.
