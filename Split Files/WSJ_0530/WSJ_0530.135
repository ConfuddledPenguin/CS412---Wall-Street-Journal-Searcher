   A surprising surge in U.S. gasoline futures lifted
petroleum prices world-wide.
   The sizzling rally in late trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange drove unleaded gasoline for June delivery
2.38 cents a gallon higher. It settled at 65.79 cents.

   Pricing volatility had been expected for the June gasoline
contract this week because Thursday is its last day of
trading. But July gasoline also was up by nearly the two-cent
limit. It settled at 62.96 cents a gallon, a gain of 1.96
cents.
   "People are saying we could have a tight gasoline market
and that {the futures price} could get up to 70 cents again,"
said John Hill, a Merrill Lynch vice president.
   The gasoline rally helped pull up other petroleum prices.
In U.S. futures trading, the New York Mercantile Exchange
crude for July delivery was up 18 cents to $17.98 a barrel at
the close.
   Before rebounding, the July crude had fallen to $17.45 a
barrel, which traders later cited as a technical support
point. The August crude contract rose six cents to $18.58 a
barrel.
   Before trading began yesterday in the U.S., oil prices
appeared to be headed down. In European markets, spot prices
of North Sea crudes dropped between 40 cents and 50 cents a
barrel, according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum
Report.
   But later the New York Merc rally developed and spread to
London's International Petroleum Exchange, which has long
trading hours. On the IPE, Brent-blend crude futures closed
eight cents to 23 cents a barrel higher.
   There was news concerning the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries that may have helped turn around the weak
oil market. Oil production in Gabon, an OPEC member, has been
hurt because of the civil unrest there. From Baghdad, where
the Arab summit meeting is being held, the oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates issued a new
call for OPEC members to abide by production quotas. That
followed yesterday's report in this newspaper that monitors
of OPEC output expect to report May production down by as as
much as 500,000 barrels a day.
   There still is a huge surplus of crude oil overhanging
world petroleum markets, however. And by now, gasoline prices
usually have begun to firm, because this is what the oil
industry calls the driving season, which traditionally begins
with the Memorial Day weekend. Still, demand for gasoline has
been essentially flat.
   But oil-market participants apparently are looking at
supplies rather than demand. "We are coming into the
high-demand season some 10 million barrels under a year ago
{in gasoline inventories} and with low production," said Joe
Bongiorno, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   He and others cited the relatively low operating rates of
U.S. refineries and the fact that many of them are in
prolonged shutdowns for maintenance. As a result, the next of
the industry's weekly reports on U.S. oil statistics, to be
released today, is generally expected to show another
drawdown in gasoline inventories. As of May 18, gasoline
inventories totaled 213.2 million barrels, down from 221.3
million a year earlier.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Due to heavy rains in recent weeks,
nearly 27% of the U.S. soybean crop is in the ground,
compared with 53% last year, according to an Agriculture
Department report released after the close of futures trading
yesterday. The U.S. corn crop is 81% planted, compared with
83% last year, which is roughly what many analysts had
expected. All figures were for the week ended last Sunday.
The 27% soybean planting figure was below many analysts'
estimates of 30% to 40% planted, but isn't likely to send
soybean futures prices soaring today. That's because weather
forecasts updated at noon yesterday called for much less rain
this week across many growing areas than had been earlier
predicted. "We only need three to four sunny days to play
catch-up in soybeans," one analyst said. Also weighing on
soybean futures prices was an increase in soybean sales by
Brazilian farmers, whose product was made cheaper on
international markets because of a currency devaluation by
the Brazilian government, U.S. futures analysts said. Soybean
futures for July delivery dropped 13 cents a bushel to close
at $6.06. July corn futures gained 0.25 cent a bushel to
close at $2.8425.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Most pork belly futures contracts
closed up the daily price limit of two cents a pound on
mounting concerns that warehouse supplies of frozen pork
bellies are at low levels relative to the traditional summer
increase in demand for bacon. An industry report released
late Friday showed that only five million pounds of pork
bellies were added to storage in April, compared with an
expected increase of as much as 12 million pounds, said
Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago. As of May 1 there were 102.2 million pounds
of bellies in storage, he said. That figure is larger than
the 10-year average for bellies in storage on May 1, but
substantially less than last year's 143.8 million pounds in
storage. Movement of bellies into cold storage so far this
month has totaled about one million pounds, compared to a
10-year average of about seven million pounds of pork bellies
stored in May, Mr. Levitt said. Pork belly futures for July
delivery closed up two cents a pound at 67.85 cents on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The July contract opened near
its day's high at 14.63 cents a pound and steadily weakened
to as low as 13.90 cents before settling at 14.03 cents, off
0.66 cent from Friday's close. The market was responding to a
new F.O. Licht report that contained two pieces of bearish
news: Estimated production in the season ending Aug. 30 was
revised upward to 108.55 million metric tons from a previous
estimate of 107.91 million metric tons; consumption was
revised down to 107.86 million metric tons from 108.07
million previously. Judith Ganes, commodity analyst at
Merrill Lynch in New York, said the market was given a shock
of reality when it saw the net result of these estimate
changes switch from a 157,000-ton production deficit to a
690,000-ton surplus. "Though the market knew bearish figures
were probably on the way, seeing them in print was somewhat
of a shock," she said. The market was hit by selling through
brokerage firms -- which is how individual investors trade --
by commodity funds and by professional floor traders known as
"locals." There could be some additional follow-through
selling, Ms. Ganes noted, as calls go out for investors to
put up more money to maintain their positions. Even with the
revised estimates, Ms. Ganes said supply and demand are still
in close balance and that the market could rally on very
little news. Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at
PaineWebber in New York, said the July contract fell below an
important support level at 14.08 cents. He said that the most
recent Licht report clearly represents an important change in
market fundamentals. "The market was looking for a fifth
consecutive season in which consumption exceeded production,
and it now realizes that it is not going to get it," Mr.
Savaiko said. He also noted that people in the sugar industry
generally believed a surplus wouldn't materialize until the
1990-91 season.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices of soonest-maturing futures contracts rose,
with July jumping two cents, the daily price-move limit, to
82.03 cents a pound. Other delivery months were up less or
even fell. According to Thomas Mueller, senior cotton analyst
at Merrill Lynch in New York, the limited strength was
apparently due to a very small stock of certified cotton
available for delivery against the July contract. He noted
that only 49,366 bales are now available for delivery, and
that 3,868 of those bales are likely to be decertified. He
estimates that the number of July contracts outstanding is
equivalent to more than 1.7 million bales. However, Mr.
Mueller said he doesn't believe that a squeeze would actually
occur in the July contract, because he thinks the holders of
long positions will abandon them before the delivery period
starts on June 25. "Most traders should be out of the July
contract long before June 25; the July contract is just too
volatile," said Mr. Mueller. He also said that many traders
were executing a strategy in which they bought July or
October contracts and sold December, causing its price to
decline. He added that the volume of trading was estimated at
an unimpressive 7,000 contracts. Mr. Mueller said: "It will
be difficult to sustain prices above 82 cents -- a
psychologically important area."
