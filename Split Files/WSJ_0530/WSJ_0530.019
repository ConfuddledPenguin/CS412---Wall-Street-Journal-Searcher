   There's growing cause to worry about your credit record:
It can cost you a job.
   In a practice affecting hundreds of thousands of job
seekers, a fast-rising number of companies are checking the
personal credit reports of prospective employees to judge
their integrity.

   Many jobs applicants may never even know it's happening.
That's because companies often don't tell them -- sometimes
in violation of the law, critics maintain. Some also question
the predictive value of the reports and charge that many
companies misuse them to obtain personal data they aren't
supposed to consider, such as age or marital status.
   Employers using credit reports, however, contend that
knowing how an applicant handles bills, loans and other
financial obligations helps predict whether he or she is
likely to steal, sell company secrets or otherwise act
irresponsibly on the job.
   Many banks and retailers that routinely consult credit
reports before granting credit lines or loans have long used
the reports to screen would-be tellers and cashiers. But,
citing rising internal theft and concern about their
liability for worker wrongdoing, a broader range of companies
are using the reports to screen for all types of positions.
   The boom in credit screening follows tight limits on
polygraph testing that took effect last year. In response,
the nation's three big credit-reporting agencies began
marketing their files to employers hungry for an alternative
evaluation tool.
   Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, which started selling its
employee-screening reports in July 1988 just after the
lie-detector ban was signed into law, claims it sold 350,000
of its reports to some 15,000 employers in 1989. It says
demand in the first quarter of this year ran 71% ahead of the
same period last year. Trans Union Credit Information Co. of
Chicago began selling employee-screening reports last
November and says it sold nearly 26,000 in March alone. TRW
Inc.'s credit data division in Orange, Calif., introduced its
reports in December but declines to release figures.
   Some employers praise the reports. After a rise in theft
that it traced to employees, Barry's Jewelers Inc., Monrovia,
Calif., started using credit reports last month to supplement
job interviews, applications and "pencil and paper" tests,
which seek to gauge integrity through multiple-choice
questions on ethical dilemmas. "It's one more added
precaution," says Carolyn J. Harrington, director of loss
prevention and internal audit.
   Of 62 candidates screened during the first three weeks of
the program, Barry's rejected 16, including three for
problems arising from credit reports. "We deal with loose
diamonds, we deal with highly resalable merchandise," Ms.
Harrington adds. "You have to take every opportunity
available to you to prevent hiring a thief."
   Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain based in
Seattle, runs credit checks on finalists for "sensitive" jobs
in its security, financial and credit departments. "When
somebody's having financial problems, there's more pressure
on them to do things they otherwise wouldn't do," says John
Walgamott, who as the chain's credit manager oversees 400
people who handle customer charge accounts. "One person could
hit you for thousands of dollars."
   Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based maker of medical
supplies, evaluates credit reports as "part of the routine
reference-checking on everybody," says Ellen Walvoord,
director of corporate communications. "If a person had
serious financial problems as revealed in their credit
report, it could affect their suitability for certain
positions," she adds, declining to be more specific.
   At less than $5 each, credit reports are cheap. They are
also simple to obtain, since the big credit agencies sell
online computer access to their data bases.
   Not every company is biting, but those that are often are
skittish about discussing the practice. J.C. Penney Co.
consults the reports on a "selective basis," says a
spokesman, but he wouldn't elaborate. "We really don't care
to talk about how we're using it," he says.
   Secrecy can affect job seekers, too. Under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the primary federal law on credit reports,
credit agencies must tell applicants they are being probed
only if their files contain public records on "adverse"
matters, such as arrests, suits, court judgments and tax
penalties. About 8% of reports contain such records, TRW
says.
   Employers, meanwhile, needn't inform job seekers about a
credit check when they apply (though many do so on
application forms). But when rejecting someone "either wholly
or partly because of information contained" in a credit
report, the law says a company is supposed to let that person
know and identify the agency supplying the report -- steps
often ignored, those familiar with industry practices
contend.
   "People are being denied employment because of what's in
their credit report, and are never told that's the reason,"
says Ken Yarbrough, a San Rafael, Calif., credit consultant
who once managed security for TRW's credit data business.
   "It would not surprise me that users of credit reports are
not aware of their obligations," says Jean Noonan, associate
director for credit practices at the Federal Trade
Commission, which regulates credit report practices. Without
disclosure, she adds, people might never learn to check for
troubles or errors in their records.
   Sunday K. Summer of Bossier, La., says she was rejected
for six different jobs as a hospital scrub nurse and drug
store clerk last year after employers checked her credit
report. The report states that her college loans were
delinquent -- she says they were deferred -- and also refers
to a bankruptcy-law filing made by her husband in 1981, when
he divorced his previous wife. The doctor that finally hired
her as an assistant said "that he had done some investigating
and knew that I needed the job based on my debts" --
specifically a $14,000 car loan that he couldn't have known
about, she says, unless he had checked her credit report.
   "It really felt awkward," Ms. Summer says. Having debts,
she adds, "doesn't mean I'm not going to be a good worker."
   Barry's Jewelers and Nordstrom say they strictly follow
the law when rejecting applicants for credit concerns; Abbott
declines to comment on its procedures. At Dallas-based EDS
Corp., when job offers are rescinded because of concerns
arising from credit reports, applicants initially are told
merely that "it's because of the background investigation,"
says Jon T. Senderling, public relations manager. Only "if a
person asks further," he says, does the company specify the
reason. Mr. Senderling insists that "everything we do is
completely within" the law.
   But Ms. Noonan of the FTC says companies must identify the
role of credit reports to spurned applicants forthrightly,
not just when asked.
   Interpretations of credit reports can vary widely. One
employer might balk at hiring someone with a string of late
Visa payments, while another might overlook more serious
problems, even loan defaults or bankruptcy.
   The lack of standards can lead to abuses. Besides
financial history and other background information, credit
reports may note a person's age, marital status and
dependents -- personal data most employers don't seek on
applications or in interviews because, under equal employment
laws, considering them is discriminatory.
   Yet Trans Union specifically sees its report as a way to
answer "some of the questions that you can't ask an
applicant," says Pat Malloy, a product support coordinator.
"This can fill in the holes."
   David F. Linowes, a University of Illinois professor and
expert on privacy issues, says he believes it "is not
uncommon" for employers to exploit credit reports for
personal information that could unfairly -- and illegally --
scuttle the chances of job applicants. People "do not have
adequate protection," he says.
   Moreover, some employee-testing experts contend credit
reports can't reliably predict trustworthiness. They note
that credit records can contain inaccuracies, honest people
can accrue bad credit records and people with clean credit
records aren't immune to temptation. "Managers naively assume
there's a link between a poor credit rating and theft
exposure," says John W. Jones of London House, a Chicago
personnel evaluating firm.
   Scrutinizing credit reports before hiring would flag no
more than 10% of "all the people who are acting irresponsibly
on the job," estimates Val J. Arnold, vice president of
Personnel Decisions Inc., a Minneapolis testing firm.
   Credit reporting agencies and companies can't cite studies
linking personal financial problems to dishonesty; they say
anecdotal experience and common sense prove the value of
credit reports.
   Still, William Byham, president of Development Dimensions
International Inc., a Pittsburgh-based personnel testing
firm, worries that companies are bound to unjustly reject
many promising applicants if credit reports continue to gain
appeal. "Everybody's looking for a quick fix," he says. But
"you have to spend a little time and money on selection if
you want to get good people."
