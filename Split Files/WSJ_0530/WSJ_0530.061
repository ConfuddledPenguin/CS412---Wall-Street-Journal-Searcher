   TOKYO -- Japan's leading indicator of its economy moved
well above the so-called boom-or-bust line in March, the
latest reporting month, to 68.2 from a revised 41.7 in
February, an official at the Economic Planning Agency said.
   Another agency official said that, barring a sudden change
in external factors, Japan's economy should remain in an
expanding trend. The agency considers a reading above 50 a
sign of economic expansion in the future and a reading below
50 an indication of possible contraction ahead.

   Of the leading indicator's 13 parts, those that turned
positive in March, contributing to the index's favorable
move, included construction starts, private-sector housing
starts, and the commodities index.
   The coincident indicator, which reflects the current state
of the economy, stood at 60 in March, rising from a revised
50 in February. Of the 11 parts in this index, notable
changes included the inventory ratio to production, which
swung to the plus side in March, after lingering at negative
levels since last autumn; positive turns in industrial
production and capacity utilization; and improvement in sales
by medium-sized businesses.
   The lagging indicator, which measures the economy's recent
performance, remained unchanged at 85.7.
