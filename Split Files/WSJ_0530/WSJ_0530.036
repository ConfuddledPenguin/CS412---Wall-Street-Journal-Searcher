It is a sign of the times that James Olman's Cincinnati
gallery is devoted exclusively to a genre conspicuously
underrepresented in the nation's finest museums: golf art.
   In the past few years, art depicting golf has been
furiously painted, printed, reproduced and sold at ever
higher prices. As a game, golf is enjoying some fresh
popularity. Art prices have been rising. Link the two
together and the result is expensive golf art, like the late
19th-century oil, "The Cheerful Caddy Boy," a portrait of a
smiling urchin in baggy pants carrying a set of clubs. It
recently sold for more than $15,000 to Jeff Jennings, a
collector of golf art in Greenwich, Conn., who says with some
pride, "I had a caddy boy like that when I golfed at the
Gleneagles course in Scotland."

   Modern golf artists are also cashing in on golf-art mania.
Some say they have enough commissions to paint golf holes for
the rest of their lives. Golf museums report increased
traffic, and, says one curator, people stand longer in front
of each golf painting.
   Golf art strikes art purists as kitsch. "Golf art is for
duffers who can't quite pull their britches up anymore," says
W. Graham Arader III, a New York art dealer who specializes
in European and American art of the 16th to 19th centuries.
Golf art "can look horrible, but if Bobby Jones once rubbed
up against it in a locker room in Brisbane, Australia, it's
priceless," Mr. Arader says. "People pay crazy prices for
this stuff, but I've never seen a piece of golf art I'd hang
in my home."
   Golf artists scoff at this misguided snobbery. "It's
definitely art," says LeRoy Neiman, the sports artist whose
own golf oeuvre includes the radiant "Arnie {as in Palmer} in
the Rain." Taking a world view, he adds, "People are just
going to have to adjust to it as they have to other modern
problems."
   The people who buy golf art tend to be the kinds of
golfers who watch pro tournaments on TV, play at least 18
holes a week and are apt to relive great golf moments (their
own) over drinks in the clubhouse -- relishing the 300-yard
drive, the brilliant seven-iron shot from the rough and the
final victorious 20-foot putt that causes their opponents to
weep from envy. To them, golf art is a kind of nostalgia
trip, a chance to remember their own games on the world's
great courses; or, having once glimpsed a golf god like Mr.
Palmer, a chance to frame the magic of the moment in their
office, den or rec room.
   For this reason, most golf art depicts either the great
players -- Bobby Jones, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Arnold
Palmer are the most popular -- or the great holes, the 16th
at Augusta National or the 16th at Cypress Point, for
example. (Actually, these holes are not necessarily the best
ones, golf artists say; they're popular because they're
short, treacherous and provide the most drama on televised
tournaments.)
   It also figures that the favored style of golf art is
realism, although some artists have experimented with
pointillism, surrealism and fantasy -- four golfing dogs
perched on hind legs or whimsical golf holes depicted in the
Okefenokee Swamp or in the middle of Wall Street. Golf art
also has its share of still lifes, such as Brenda Turner's
watercolors of artfully arranged clubs, balls, tees and a
blank scorecard on which a golfer can record one of his own
memorable games.
   But essentially, buyers of golf art want lots of golf and
not too much art. "You get a little artist's license to move
the odd tree or bush around," says Bill Waugh, a Scottish
golf artist, "but basically it has to be the golf course as
the golfer remembers it."
   Mr. Waugh, a self-taught water-colorist, says that if
anyone saw him at work, "they'd kill themselves laughing."
With art texts at his side, Mr. Waugh works from photos or
sketches, often for Japanese or American clients who
commission him to paint their favorite holes. Mr. Waugh says
he has heard of an American painter who, for $50,000, will
paint a golfer playing his favorite hole. However, the artist
will only paint a back view, Mr. Waugh hears, because he
hasn't mastered face or hand technique.
   Although Mr. Waugh claims never to get bored painting one
golf hole after another, he does say that he could do it in
his sleep. "You do do it in your sleep," volunteers Mr.
Waugh's wife. On the subject of the color green, Mr. Waugh
gets a bit testy. "I get fed up with green," he says. "I
really get fed up with painting greens."
   The success of people like Mr. Waugh has taken many other
aspiring golf artists off the links and into the studio, with
some unfortunate results. Mr. Olman, whose gallery receives
scores of unsolicited pieces a year, points to a group of
drawings that recently arrived of elephants swinging at golf
balls. His critical eye immediately spots a serious flaw: The
elephants are all swinging left-handed. "The market for
left-handed golfers is much smaller than the right-handed
market," says Mr. Olman, shaking his head in disgust. "The
artist, clearly not a golfer, had no idea."
   When confronted by art's equivalent of a whiff, Mr. Olman
shows no mercy. One print, of a chubby little girl swinging a
club in a field, didn't attract any buyers as art, so Mr.
Olman slapped the prints on some wastebaskets and sold them
as golf-theme trash receptacles, which have been moving quite
nicely.
   Early golf art (pre-1930) isn't necessarily better, it is
just more rare, and expensive. Traditionally, golf art has
hung in the clubhouses of country or golf clubs, and many of
the old clubs have burned down at least once over the
decades. (St. Andrews in Scotland, made of stone, is a
notable exception.) Many paintings have gone up in flames.
   Devotees of golf art say courses are beautiful landscapes,
manicured and pampered like no other land on Earth. "Players
and spectators walk out there wearing
orange-and-green-striped shirts, purple shoes, red socks, and
no one even looks twice," says Mr. Neiman. "So when the
gallery rings the green, it's like a bed of flowers." Walking
a misty fairway in the solitude of early morning is like
walking through the pearly gates, golf artists say.
   Golf is also exciting, argue the sport's fans, and there
is a growing body of art to illustrate it. Austin Cragg,
owner of Commemorative Golf Galleries in Greenwich, Conn., is
creating a series of prints of 560 major moments in golf. Mr.
Cragg's first such moment was a depiction of Gene Sarazin
making his "Shot Heard 'Round the World." This is not to be
confused with Tom Watson's "Chip Shot Heard 'Round the
World," by artist Michael Lane.
   Golf dealers, artists and collectors agree that golf is a
game of the wealthy, the people who can most afford to
collect art. "Golf is a major investment in a lot of
respects," says Mr. Olman, "and people become more involved
in it partly because of that." But it's not the only reason.
Mr. Jennings, the collector, says he has a photograph of
himself golfing at Muirfield in Scotland on his office wall.
"I hit this great shot on the last hole," he remembers
fondly. "It happened to be an important shot, and I won a lot
of money. I have every intention of hiring an artist and
saying, `Do it up.' "
