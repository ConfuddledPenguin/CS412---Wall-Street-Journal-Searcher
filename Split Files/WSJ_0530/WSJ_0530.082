   WIESBADEN, West Germany -- West German wholesale sales
fell 2% after inflation in April from April 1989, the result
of a steep decline in sales of raw materials and semifinished
goods that weighed against steady sales of finished goods,
the Federal Statistics Office here said.
   A total of 71 billion Deutsche marks ($42.2 billion) of
wholesale sales were recorded in April.
