   MIAMI -- Scat Hovercraft Inc. said its board voted to
remove Ronald R. Molina as president, chairman and chief
executive officer and as a director.
   The maker of recreational hovercraft vehicles gave no
reason for the action. Neither company officials nor Mr.
Molina could be reached for comment.

   The board elected Jordan R. Finn, secretary and a
director, as interim president and interim chief executive
officer until a new president is chosen.
   Scat said Mr. Molina had resigned from his positions, had
terminated his employment agreement and had resigned as a
board member. Last Friday, however, during a special meeting
of the board, Mr. Molina attempted to withdraw his
resignation, Scat said.
   At that point, the board voted to remove Mr. Molina from
his positions and to terminate his employment agreement "in
the event {Mr.} Molina's prior resignation and termination
were ineffective," the company said in a news release.
