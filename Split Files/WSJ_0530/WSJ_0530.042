   STOCKHOLM -- LM Ericsson, buoyed by strong growth in its
phone-switching equipment and cellular radio-systems
businesses, plans to boost its profit by more than 25% this
year.
   However, Lars Ramquist, Ericsson's president and chief
executive officer, declined to predict revenue growth.
Although revenue rose by 30% in the first quarter, there is
increasing pressure from falling prices in the world
telecommunications equipment market, the executive explained.

   "We're running full speed now," said Mr. Ramquist. But he
cautioned, "I'm concerned that we are doing so well that it
could go away easily. No tree grows to heaven." He added that
the company should split its stock 5-1 by mid-September.
   He said Ericsson faces numerous hurdles in the 1990s,
chief among them the challenge of remaining a major player in
the European market. Ericsson derives 70% of its more than $6
billion in annual revenue from Western Europe. But since
Sweden isn't a member of the Common Market, Ericsson could
feel a squeeze on its business as Europe moves to lower
market barriers after 1992.
   "We {come from} such a small country . . . that we will
always have to fight uphill" against rivals such as West
Germany's Siemens and France's Alcatel, he said.
   Mr. Ramquist, 52 years old, rose through Ericsson's ranks
from its Radio Systems business, where the company has posted
some of its biggest gains in recent years, capturing 40% of
the world market for cellular network systems. He took his
new position only three weeks ago.
   Mr. Ramquist said Ericsson's core business has a strong
order book that should enable it to navigate competition from
such rivals as Siemens and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   On the radio systems side, Mr. Ramquist said orders in the
U.S. for cellular network systems remain strong. But he's
also counting on a new joint venture with General Electric
Co. to boost Ericsson's share of the cellular subscriber
phone business.
