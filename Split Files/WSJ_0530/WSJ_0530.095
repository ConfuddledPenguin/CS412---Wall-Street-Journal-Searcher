   NEW YORK -- The CBS and Fox networks unveiled bold and
risky strategies in their prime-time television schedules,
with CBS revamping much of its troubled lineup and Fox taking
aim at NBC's juggernaut Thursday roster.
   CBS, the No. 3 network in prime time for three years,
added 10 shows it hopes will attract the younger audience
that advertisers seek -- and one that has eluded the network
for decades. The CBS Inc. unit will try new lead-off shows in
the 8 p.m. slot on five nights of the week, trying to bolster
the major weakness of its schedule.

   News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., doing surprisingly well
with only three nights a week of programming, is adding two
more nights and throwing its biggest hit -- the cartoon
series "The Simpsons" -- against one of the most potent
comedies in TV history, NBC's "The Cosby Show."
   A network rarely moves a new hit to a new night. But
pitting "The Simpsons" against "Cosby" underscores a
widespread belief in the TV industry that NBC's Thursday
lineup is weakening -- and that Bill Cosby, in particular,
might be vulnerable to spiky-haired Bart Simpson.
   "We're going after them," said Peter Chernin, Fox's top
programming executive. Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment
president, said he welcomes the challenge.
   CBS also senses weakness in NBC's Thursday lineup. It is
moving the CBS News series "48 Hours" from 8 p.m. Thurdays to
10 p.m. Saturdays -- the lowest-viewing night of the week --
to try "The Flash," based on a comic book superhero. "Ours
not to reason why, ours but to do or die," said Dan Rather,
the CBS News anchorman who also hosts "48 Hours."
   Both CBS and Fox canceled a plethora of shows.
   Of CBS's nine series introduced last fall, only one,
"Major Dad," is an outright survivor. CBS will have new
lineups on five nights. CBS axed "Tour of Duty," its
two-year-old Vietnam war series. "Wiseguy" won't be on the
fall schedule but will return later in the season -- without
actor Ken Wahl. The fate of the western "Paradise" is
uncertain.
   CBS also will revamp "Saturday Night with Connie Chung"
and move the reworked show, "Face to Face with Connie Chung,"
to 10 p.m. Mondays. Jeff Sagansky, CBS Entertainment
president, said the show will be "more celebrity driven" than
the Saturday series.
   CBS also killed "City," "Sydney," "Sugar and Spice,"
"Loose Cannon," and "Normal Life." "Falcon Crest" and
"Newhart" also will disappear from the schedule following
long runs.
   The CBS schedule seems to shy away from the daring
concepts of some rivals.
   Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC has its oddball drama "Twin
Peaks" and the musical, "Cop Rock." NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., has a comedy starring rapper Fresh Prince, as
well as a musical set in a high school.
   CBS will stick with traditional TV comedies, trying five:
"Uncle Buck," based on a John Candy movie and seen as the
best newcomer on CBS; "Lenny," a blue-collar guy with three
kids; "The Hammersmiths," a one-hour comedy about an extended
family; "Evening Shade," with Burt Reynolds, and "Four Alarm
Family," a single father rearing four sons.
   One-hour dramas on CBS include "WIOU," about a struggling
Midwest news station, and "Over My Dead Body," with Edward
Woodward as a mystery writer akin to Angela Lansbury in CBS's
"Murder, She Wrote." "The Green Machine" is about an
environmental A-Team.
   At Fox, five current shows have been yanked: "21 Jump
Street," its first breakthrough series; its spinoff,
"Booker"; "Alien Nation"; "Open House," and the much-touted
young-toughs series from Francis Ford Coppola, "The
Outsiders." The demise of two others already had been set:
"It's Garry Shandling's Show" and "The Tracey Ullman Show."
   Fox, now airing shows on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays,
will add nine new programs as it expands to Thursdays and
Fridays. "American Chronicles" is from "Twin Peaks"
co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and is a "video novel"
about "extraordinary people." The new comedies include
"Babes," about three sisters; "True Colors," about an
interracial marriage; and "Parker Lewis Can't Lose," about a
high school student.
   New dramas on Fox include "D.E.A.," about drug agents,
which will follow the manhunt show "America's Most Wanted."
"Class of Beverly Hills" is about a Midwest family
transplanted to the Los Angeles suburb, and "Against the
Law," is about yet another cracker-jack attorney.
