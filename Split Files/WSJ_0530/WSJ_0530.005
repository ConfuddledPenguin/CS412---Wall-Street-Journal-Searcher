   BOSTON -- Massachusetts is considering adopting a 5% sales
tax on services -- including fees charged by mutual fund
managers and other financial services -- that would be among
the broadest in the nation.
   A bill approved by the state Senate also would impose the
tax on fees charged by accountants, lawyers and
public-relations firms, among others, as part of a tax
package designed to eliminate an estimated $800 million
budget deficit for the year ending June 30.

   The state House, however, has proposed its own ideas to
reduce the budget deficit, passing a bill that would increase
the state income tax. The two bodies could meet in a joint
committee later this week to begin to chisel a final version.
   The Senate bill is also likely to face fierce lobbying
efforts from groups representing service companies. Indeed, a
similar proposal in Florida three years ago set off a
national outcry among lobbyists and was soundly defeated. And
two weeks ago, New York dropped an effort to tax advertising,
accounting and other services as part of a tax-raising
package.
   Among the most vocal critics of the proposed Massachusetts
tax is the state's mutual fund industry, which includes
Fidelity Investments, the U.S.'s largest mutual fund company.
"It's clearly unfair," argued Jonathan Dubitzky, a Boston
attorney who represents a number of financial services
groups. "The added expense would make a firm like Fidelity
less competitive than Dreyfus or any out-of-state money
manager. Almost no state in this country is crazy enough to
tax its own exports."
   This tax could lead to a mass exodus of such financial
services, adds Richard A. Manley, president of the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation Inc. "Massachusetts is the
birthplace of the mutual fund industry. I think you'll lose
them all," he says. "It's one thing for a manufacturing
company to move. For a lot of these folks it's a matter of
putting a computer on a truck and getting out."
   In sculpting its bill to tax services, the Massachusetts
Senate excluded fees charged by advertising agencies, in part
because of heavy lobbying. An advertising tax would have
brought in about $25 million in a overall package aimed at
generating $930 million in added revenue, says Joseph Brady,
fiscal adviser for Senate President William Bulger's office.
"We were told Florida had a lot of trouble with advertising
so the decision was to leave it out," he says. In 1987,
Florida repealed its law after only a few months, after
advertisers threatened to take their business to other
states.
   Lobbying by service-industry groups in Massachusetts has
been intense over the past week, legislators say. But adds
Joan Fallon, spokeswoman for Sen. Patricia McGovern,
"Lobbyists don't change a public opinion poll {taken last
week}, which shows people favor the proposal by a 3-to-1
vote."
   Passage of the bill could embolden other states on the
hunt for new tax avenues. "The Florida experience made states
nervous," says Christopher Zimmerman, chief economist for the
National Conference of State Legislatures. "But there's not
an economic justification to exclude this area; goods and
services are the same thing. Massachusetts could open the
door wider."
   By the year 2000 services are expected to constitute 70%
of the nation's economy, up from 30% in 1950. "If we don't
change our tax structure we'll be losing ground," says Ronald
Schreiner, secretary of the Department of Revenue for South
Dakota, which already taxes many of the services on
Massachusetts' list. "We believe this is the wave of the
future," he says.
   Hawaii and New Mexico, in addition to South Dakota, also
tax a broad variety of services. But many of those laws have
been in the books for more than a decade or two, and major
industrial states so far have avoided such taxes.
   Last year Connecticut passed a watered-down version of a
bill, limiting taxation to such things as architectural and
engineering services, telecommunications, locksmithing and
property renovations, among others.
   Lawmakers there orginally considered including accounting,
legal services and advertising in the bill, notes Rep.
William Cibes, chairman of Connecticut's House finance
committee. "Lobbying was intense," he says. "For example, the
advertising group made it very clear to {legislative} members
that they would go after them come election time.
Consequently, we didn't get the votes."
   Connecticut enacted its tax law with some regret, concedes
Rep. Cibes. "I think this has made our engineers and
architects less competitive. Many of our historical
restoration projects aren't renovating as a result."
