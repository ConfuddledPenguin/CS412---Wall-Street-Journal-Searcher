   A federal judge ruled that it is illegal under New York
law to buy an interest in a patent solely to pursue
patent-infringement lawsuits.
   In the decision against Refac International Ltd. -- whose
main business is buying up broad patents and then suing other
companies for alleged infringements -- U.S. District Judge
Michael Mukasey said such arrangements amount to "nothing but
a hunting license."

   The case involved a software patent that Refac claimed was
being infringed by six major software companies: Lotus
Development Corp., Ashton-Tate Inc., Borland International
Inc., Computer Associates International Inc., Microsoft Corp.
and Informix Software Inc. The suit, filed in 1989, is one of
the first patent-infringement cases involving computer
software.
   The judge said Refac's contract with the Canadian patent
holders, who sold Refac a 5% stake in the patent, violated
New York's so-called champerty statute. Champerty, which is
illegal in many, but not all, states, occurs when someone
helps pay the costs of someone else's lawsuit in exchange for
a share of any proceeds.
   Judge Mukasey, in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., said
the real plaintiff in the case is Forward Reference Systems
Ltd., the Canadian firm that owns 95% of the patent. The
judge said the case will be dismissed unless Forward
Reference either joins or replaces Refac in the suit.
   "The primary purpose for the assignment here was to enable
Refac to commence actions as {Forward Reference's} surrogate
plaintiff," the judge ruled.
   Lawyers for the software companies praised the decision,
which also said their clients could seek to require Refac to
pay their legal costs.
   Henry B. Gutman, a lawyer for Lotus, said the decision
could have implications for other companies that have been
targeted by New York-based Refac for alleged patent
infringement. "If someone wants to bring a patent
infringement case, they have to bring a patent infringement
case. They can't bring in a hired gun like Refac," Mr. Gutman
said.
   Attorneys for Refac couldn't be reached for comment.
Forward Reference also couldn't be reached.
   The software involved was designed to improve the way
computer instructions are given when a spreadsheet is
processed. The patent was issued in 1983 to Remy Landau and
Rene Pardo, two Canadian inventors, who formed Forward
Reference.
   Frustrated in their efforts to get the software companies
to license the patent -- which the Refac lawsuit claims the
companies were already using -- the inventors turned to Refac
in 1989. In granting Refac the 5% stake, the company was
required to sue at least two alleged patent infringers within
one month.
   Judge Mukasey said, "The agreement acknowledges that
Refac's 5% interest is `to facilitate suit in Refac's name as
plaintiff and to avoid the need for having {Forward
Reference} named or brought into the suit as a co-plaintiff.'
It is clear that Refac is not the real party in interest."

   HOSPITALS WIN Medicare payment dispute with federal health
agency.
   A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that an
estimated 6,000 hospitals don't have to comply with a
Department of Health and Human Services regulation that, in
effect, required them to accept partial payment for Medicare
patients.
   The HHS rule required payments to hospitals be limited to
the amount specified by Medicare, even if the patient
received additional liability-award payments or was entitled
to them under a liability-insurance policy. The hospitals
sought the right to dip into such liability awards to help
cover actual costs. The hospitals estimated that Medicare
pays 23% to 50% less than their charge.
   Judge Royce Lambeth ruled last week that the federal
government couldn't interfere with hospitals' statutory right
to bill liability insurers or file liens against liability
awards to collect their full charges for treatment of
Medicare payments.
   "This ruling will allow hospitals to collect millions of
dollars that otherwise would have been lost," said Gregory M.
Luce, a partner at Fulbright &amp; Jaworski, the law firm that
represented the American Hospital Association, which brought
the suit.
   Health and Human Services attorney Darrel Ginstead said it
was the department's position that patients benefited from a
system that shielded their liability awards from the
hospitals' grasp. He said the department hasn't decided
whether to appeal the ruling.

   "WORKING POOR" are targeted by law firm for pro-bono
efforts.
   Hunton &amp; Williams of Richmond, Va., the Southeast's
largest law firm, is opening a neighborhood office to provide
legal services to residents who have jobs but can't afford
lawyers.
   The office, which will be headed by a full-time partner
and 11 part-time associates, will serve those who earn above
the threshold for federal poverty benefits, including
legal-aid services, but who make under twice that amount.
(The threshold is $8,600 for an individual and goes up
incrementally according to the number of dependents in the
family.)
   "It's intended to reach the working poor, people who have
jobs and a paycheck but don't have enough money in their
savings to pay for a lawyer," said George H. Hettrick, the
partner who conceived of the idea.
   Several large law firms have opened satellite offices in
poor neighborhoods and offer legal services for free. But
this is one of the first attempts to meet the needs of people
who, while poor, have enough income to disqualify them from
federally assisted legal aid.
   Clients will be asked to pay a flat $50 fee, plus such
routine costs as filing fees. Initially, the office will only
represent clients in housing and real-estate matters, such as
landlord-tenant disputes, uncontested domestic matters and
guardianship questions involving juveniles and the elderly,
said Lewis F. Powell III, a partner and chairman of the
firm's pro-bono committee.
   Hutton &amp; Williams ruled out taking on criminal-defense
cases because the firm doesn't specialize in criminal-defense
work, said Mr. Powell. Since Hunton &amp; Williams represents
many of Richmond's major employers, the firm will be
precluded from handling employment-discrimination cases, as
well.
   Mr. Hettrick, who specializes in corporate finance, will
staff the office. Eleven associates volunteered to donate 100
hours a year, said Mr. Powell. The office is expected to open
next month.
