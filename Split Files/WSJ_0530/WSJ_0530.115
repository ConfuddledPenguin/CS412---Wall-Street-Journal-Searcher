   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. said it temporarily halted its
withdrawal from Pennsylvania's automobile insurance market
and agreed to rescind the 9,000 non-renewal notices it had
already sent to policyholders in the state.
   State regulators acknowledge that the Hartford, Conn.,
company, the fifth-largest insurer working in Pennsylvania,
has complied with the state's new auto insurance law by
submitting a rate filing that provides premium rollbacks of
10% and up to 22% for policyholders who choose a limited tort
option.

   At the same time, the company has resubmitted a filing for
relief from these rollbacks under an "extraordinary
circumstances" clause in the new law, which was enacted in
February.
   Aetna submitted the rate-relief filing in April, but it
was returned without any action by state insurance
regulators. The insurance department has promised to rule on
Aetna's rate-relief filing in 10 working days. Aetna has
200,000 automobile policyholders in Pennsylvania.
   However, Aetna and the state haven't yet dropped their
respective lawsuits against each other. Aetna is one of seven
insurers being sued by the state to force compliance with the
new law. The state was also seeking a temporary injunction
against the company because Aetna had ignored an order from
the insurance department to stop sending out the non-renewal
notices.
   Aetna has challenged the constitutionality of the new law
and asked a federal court to enjoin the Pennsylvania
insurance commissioner from taking any action to block its
exit from the state's auto insurance market.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey is still maintaining a
tough stance in making insurers comply with the new law. "I
don't believe insurers have a universal right to pick up and
leave after doing business here for so many years and
throwing their policyholders to the wolves. That's not good
policy," he said at a news conference last week. Yet, he also
is willing to negotiate.
   Last week, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. reached a
similar pact with Pennsylvania officials, agreeing to
continue to provide auto insurance for its 65,000
policyholders in this state. The insurance department was
expected to rule on its rate filing today.
   As part of their agreement, Harleysville and the state
dropped their lawsuits against each other.
   The insurance department already has ruled on seven
rate-relief filings, exempting Keystone Insurance Co. and
Colonial Penn Insurance Co. from the mandatory 10% and 22%
rate rollbacks. The state is requiring smaller rollbacks in
most instances from these two companies. The state based its
decision on an assumption that each company would be earning
a 12% return on its surplus capital.
   Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., one of the five companies
whose rate-relief filing wasn't granted, yesterday filed an
appeal with a state court, asking for a formal hearing to
review the insurance department's ruling. Nationwide, which
insures 800,000 drivers in Pennsylvania, claims the rollbacks
required by the new law would provide rates that would be too
low to pay claims and cover its operating costs in the state.
   Nationwide also will continue to pursue a lawsuit it had
previously filed in federal court, seeking a preliminary
injunction against the state to block key portions of the new
insurance law from going into effect.
