   The World Bank in Washington approved a $300 million loan
to China to help finance long-term forestry development
projects, but it delayed action on two other credits,
totaling $150 million, for transportation projects.
   The bank's executive directors also cleared $402 million
in loans to Mexico to support economic reforms in the
trucking industry and other sectors of its economy. Part of
the money also will be used for telecommunications projects.

   The loan to China will finance treeplanting. It will be
provided by the International Development Association, a
World Bank affiliate.
   A Treasury spokesman said the U.S. supported the loan
because it meets basic human needs. He said the credit will
help China overcome a serious shortage of wood needed for the
construction of houses and for cooking and heating in rural
areas. The forestry projects also will generate part-time and
seasonal employment for workers in poor rural areas, he
added.
   The U.S., voicing concern about China's repression of
pro-democracy groups, opposed the two transportation-sector
loans.
