   When Sandra Kurtzig quit as president and chief executive
officer of ASK Computer Systems Inc. five years ago, she
vowed never to return to the company she co-founded in 1972,
saying she wanted more time for her children and herself.
   But last September, the entrepreneur returned to run ASK,
a Mountain View, Calif., producer of management information
systems for manufacturing companies. Her goal: to bring back
the entrepreneurial spirit to a company that lost it.

   "Many aging entrepreneurial companies are trying to
restore the energy and vitality that brought them their
initial success," says William Sahlman, an associate
professor of finance at Harvard Business School. Especially
after professional managers have succeeded founding
entrepreneurs, companies often start "looking for someone
else to stir up the pot," he says.
   Ms. Kurtzig's unusual experience of running a company for
a second time shows one approach to the difficult problem of
reviving the entrepreneurial spirit. So far, the 42-year-old
executive has redesigned products, got rid of laggard
managers, recruited new directors with entrepreneurial
backgrounds, and subtly changed the atmosphere. Employees
even say the food and beer at the "Friday bash" have
improved.
   Even though ASK had sales of $186.3 million for the year
ended last June 30, "Its business had grown stale," says
Peter West, ASK vice president, business development. True,
earnings in fiscal 1989 climbed to $13.5 million, or $1 a
share, from $10.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year
earlier. But directors anticipated a decline, and sure
enough, in the nine months ended March 31, profit dropped 73%
to $2.4 million, or 18 cents a share, from $8.7 million, or
65 cents a share, a year earlier.
   While earnings had climbed in recent years, ASK had
concentrated too much on creating products for the
minicomputer and failed to develop products for the emerging
workstation market, analysts say. And although the company
had been exploring new products and new markets, "its
toe-in-the-water approach would hurt it somewhere down the
road," says Charles E. Taylor Jr., an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Since returning to ASK, Ms. Kurtzig has discovered that
reviving the entrepreneurial climate in an 18-year old
company can be a formidable task. The company that she and
her husband, Ari, started in a second bedroom now has 55
offices world-wide and nearly 1,000 employees. But ASK, which
once dominated the market for information systems for
manufacturers, has relinquished a large share to a number of
aggressive newcomers.
   "Sandy's advantage is that she knows the business and
helped put it in place," says Paul Ely, a venture capitalist
who joined ASK's board this year. "Founders are the best flag
carriers."
   In 1972, Ms. Kurtzig quit as a marketing specialist with a
General Electric Co. unit, and she and her husband launched
ASK -- named for the first initials in their names, Ari and
Sandra Kurtzig. At first, the company developed software for
assorted business applications, but in 1978, it came up with
a program that ran on a Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputer and
could help small manufacturing companies run an entire plant.
The program was an instant hit, and ASK's profit and sales
soared. ASK went public in 1981. Two years later, Ms.
Kurtzig's personal stake in ASK was valued at $67 million.
   By 1985, Ms. Kurtzig was divorced from her husband and
raising two sons, then aged 12 and 9. When she resigned as
ASK chief executive, the company recruited top management
with a big-business background.
   "I felt guilty about all the attention I got, became tired
of being the news," Ms. Kurtzig says. The divorce, a
shareholder lawsuit concerning shares she sold at a secondary
stock offering, and the constant focus on her as the first
woman to head a major high-technology concern took their
toll. "It all became very wearisome," she says.
   After Ms. Kurtzig left, ASK continued to post earnings
gains. But "it lost its entrepreneurial edge and market
leadership," says Mr. Taylor, the Prudential-Bache analyst.
Unlike Ms. Kurtzig, who constantly met with fellow employees
and workers, and was closely involved with ASK's operations,
the new managers were distant and unapproachable, says Mr.
West, the business development vice president.
   Moreover, investment in new products declined to near
zero. During Ms. Kurtzig's earlier tenure, the company had
been plowing back almost half of its research and development
funds into new product development; later, practically all
the R&amp;D money was used to enhance existing products.
   By the middle of last year, ASK's board was determined to
bring Ms. Kurtzig back. In the four years after she left ASK,
Ms. Kurtzig wrote her autobiography, traveled extensively and
invested in a few Silicon Valley companies. But "you could
see she was frustrated at not having found the right company
to run," a close friend says. When the board asked her to
come back as chief executive, she readily agreed.
   Among her first steps was to bring on entrepreneurially
minded people to the board. To increase employee
participation in ASK, Ms. Kurtzig asked research and
development employees to rate the performance of the
division's managers. The top-rated managers were rewarded
with greater responsibility, she says. Most of those who
received low ratings are "not with the company any more," she
says.
   She also put an end to the practice of senior managers
giving themselves hefty raises and bonuses. "I don't like the
idea of one group giving itself bonuses over others who also
deserve it," she says. "It creates divisiveness. It prevents
team-playing." Focusing on team spirit and communication, Ms.
Kurtzig tries to attend many company meetings to observe and
follow what is happening.
   When problems loom, Ms. Kurtzig has been quick to
intervene personally. When customers of a product line that
was recently acquired by ASK complained that they felt
"insecure and unsure of ASK's commitment" to them, Ms.
Kurtzig met with the user group to outline plans for the
product and reassure users.
   She also is working on ASK's next generation of products,
making them simpler to use and compatible with different
types of computers and data bases, says Nicholas Coutros, a
manufacturing technology analyst with Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm. ASK also is increasing its
efforts to sell its products for a variety of computer
systems, including those made by International Business
Machines Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. And the company,
which sold its products directly to users, now is exploring
other sales channels as well. To position itself in a new
global manufacturing market, ASK is establishing offices in
Europe and Asia.
   Mr. Coutros says he doesn't expect all these changes to
pay off on the bottom line for a year or so. But Ms. Kurtzig
says ASK has more opportunities now than it did when she
founded the company. An established base of customers and
almost $30 million in cash give ASK a "head start on its
competitors," she says.
