   "Nothing is too trivial for these people to investigate,"
said the official giving the Justice Department's view of
independent counsels. "The proof of that lies in what we
already know about their expenditures." When Assistant
Attorney General John Bolton made these comments in 1987,
Lawrence Walsh's office was less than a year old and had
spent $1.3 million.
   Mr. Walsh's office now reports that it's spent more than
$20 million. Despite expectations that he'd take down his
shingle after the John Poindexter trial, Mr. Walsh this month
called a new grand jury. He may prosecute more officials for
what he calls a "pattern of deceit."

   Mr. Walsh's office begins to look like a permanent agency,
but a government office with a difference. Freedom from
accountability for independent counsels seems to extend to
making it impossible to find out how much they've really
spent. I know. I've tried.
   Mr. Walsh's reported expenses of $20.8 million do not
include costs that his prosecutions forced onto other
government offices. On request, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's staff disclosed nearly $8 million more, shown in
the table "Iran-Contra Costs," for a total of $28.7 million.
The FBI has spent more than $5.4 million helping Mr. Walsh,
with security adding nearly another $1 million. Although the
Justice figures include $29,000 to track the Walsh budget,
officials admit these figures are seriously incomplete.
   The White House, Defense, State, CIA, National Security
Council and National Security Agency all have huge unreported
expenses. So do the courts. In 1987 alone, the White House
had to hire 60 lawyers and archivists to review classified
material. The Washington newspaper Legal Times more than a
year ago estimated that the total cost of the Iran-Contra
cases then was $40 million, possibly $100 million. This
sounds about right.
   Let's put even the low-ball $28.7 million into
perspective. This dwarfs the $3.8 million allegedly diverted
from the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Or the $13,800
"illegal gratuity" in the form of the home security fence for
Oliver North.
   And for what? We haven't learned much from the Iran-Contra
prosecutions that wasn't disclosed by the presidential Tower
Commission and the congressional hearings. Mr. Walsh never
tried to prove that the diversion itself was illegal or that
the Boland amendments applied to the National Security
Council. Judges so far have decided the crimes warranted
nothing more than community service.
   Two Contra fund raisers copped tax pleas based on what a
Justice official called a "wacko legal theory." Robert
McFarlane, Mr. North and Mr. Poindexter, respectively,
withheld information from Congress, aided and abetted in
obstructing Congress and obstructed Congress. Middlemen
Albert Hakim and Richard Secord pleaded to covering up Mr.
North's security fence. Mr. Walsh had to drop the case
against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez, but still pursues
former CIA official Thomas Clines on tax charges.
   No one has looked into any "pattern of deceit" by
Congress, but how do offenses by executive-branch officials
fit into law enforcement more generally? Contrast
Iran-Contra's $28.7 million with the $50 million budget for
the office of New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
More than 400 prosecutors last year filed criminal cases in
Manhattan against more than 120,000 defendants, including
more than 11,000 alleged felons -- $400 per defandant.
   Maybe it's more fair to compare the Walsh prosecution with
other federal prosecutors. In pursuing nine former
executive-branch officials and their private contractors, Mr.
Walsh has spent more than any of the 93 U.S. Attorneys'
Offices spent in 1989 (except for Washington, D.C., where the
federal prosecutor has many local functions). The table "Cost
Per Criminal Defendant" shows the performance of selected
U.S. Attorneys. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan
prosecuted more than 1,400 cases -- including complex Wall
Street cases -- with a budget smaller than Mr. Walsh's.
   According to a statistical report by the Justice
Department, the top two crimes targeted by U.S. Attorneys
were drugs and crimes committed with weapons. No one would
say these prosecutions had anything to do with criminalizing
the battle over separation of powers.
   Such extraordinary prosecutorial resources devoted to a
few defendants raise clear civil liberties issues. "How
frightening it must be," Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his
dissent to the case upholding these prosecutors as
constitutional, "to have your own independent counsel and
staff appointed with nothing else to do but to investigate
you." The average lawyer in a U.S. Attorney's Office handles
117 cases a year, picking them with a discretion that
independent counsels need not exercise.
   Congress created prosecutors who would show no restraint
with executive-branch targets, but this game has gone too
far. With drugs and violent crime tearing at the social
fabric, this is no time to fund political prosecutions.
