   The supervisory board chairman of Co op AG, Hans
Friderichs, resigned from his post early yesterday in an
apparent dispute with the majority owners of the troubled
West German retailing group.
   In a news release, Co op also said it will continue its
cooperation talks with Rewe-Zentral AG, another West German
food retailer.

   The company didn't give any reasons for Mr. Friderich's
resignation, which will take effect tomorrow. Two other
supervisory board members, Walter Birkhan and Wolfgang
Freiherr von Poelnitz, are also resigning.
   According to industry sources, Mr. Friderichs was opposed
to the sale of parts or all of the company to another company
by two banks that hold about 90% of Co op's shares.
   Mr. Friderichs, who negotiated the massive bank bailout
that rescued Co op from bankruptcy last autumn, was aiming to
keep the group independent and return it to profit through
its own means, the sources say.
