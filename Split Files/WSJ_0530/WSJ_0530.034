   MORGAN'S FOODS Inc. said it will begin a rights offering
to shareholders as soon as it is approved at its annual
meeting next month. The company's board last week approved a
rights offering that would give each holder the right to
purchase for $1 a share one common share for each two already
held. Morgan's said shareholders must vote to increase the
number of authorized common shares to 25 million from 15
million. Proceeds of the rights offering would be used to
reduce bank debt and other general purposes, the company
said. Morgan's Foods, which is based in Cleveland, is a
national franchisee of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.
The company has about 11.7 million shares outstanding.
