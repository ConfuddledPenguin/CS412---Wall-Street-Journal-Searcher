   Elephants and opera singers won't be performing "Aida"
this weekend at New Jersey's Giant's Stadium or in July at
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The abrupt cancellation is
embarrassing to the opera's Canadian producers, but Japanese
electronics giant Hitachi Ltd. is also singing the blues.
   This Canadian production of an Italian opera set in Egypt
was supposed to be part of Hitachi's program to enhance its
image in the U.S. "by associating us with culture," says
Harry McGrath, deputy general manager for corporate
administration at Hitachi America Ltd. The U.S. subsidiary
started a cultural sponsorship program several years ago, but
the more than $1 million it spent to sponsor the U.S. tour of
"Aida" was its biggest expenditure ever, and the first for a
non-Japanese project. Previously Hitachi's cultural
promotions had been spent on importing Japanese culture, such
as kabuki theater, to the U.S.

   "This is a grave disappointment to us," said Mr. McGrath
of the last-minute cancellation. "We've been working on this
for eight months, and it was to be our big event for the
year."
   The "Aida" opera spectacular, with 850 extras, a
46-foot-tall Sphinx and a menagerie of exotic animals, had
already been produced in six cities around the world by
International Opera Festival, a Montreal group founded for
this purpose. A spokesman for the festival blamed the
cancellation on the abrupt pull-out late last week of BCL
Group, which was contracted to produce and promote the opera
in the U.S.
   Tony Attanasio, marketing director for the International
Opera Festival, said that BCL issued a press release last
Thursday saying "they were disassociating themselves from our
company." Mr. Attanasio added, "They wouldn't tell us why."
   Gordon Currie, executive vice president of BCL
Entertainment Group, Toronto, which mostly produces
international tours of rock bands, declined to comment.
   Mr. Attanasio says about 27,000 tickets had been sold in
Giant's Stadium and a last-minute rush was expected to result
in two packed performances this weekend. But, he said, the
festival couldn't find someone else to run all the technical
aspects of the production just eight days before opening
night. He said the festival has already spent about $2
million for pre-production and promotion costs on the U.S.
tour.
   For its part, Hitachi plans to try to get back most of its
$1 million expenditure on "Aida," and it may be more careful
in the future about what it chooses to sponsor. But Hitachi's
Mr. McGrath said he doesn't think consumers will blame
Hitachi for the cancellation, adding: "If the Rolling Stones
were to cancel their tour, I don't think people would stop
drinking Budweiser."
