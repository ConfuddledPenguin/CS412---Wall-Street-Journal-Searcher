   Commuters on the Long Island Railroad will notice an
unusual thing when they arrive Friday in New York's busiest
train station, Pennsylvania Station: It will no longer be a
shelter for the homeless. New regulations adopted by the
railroad will forbid sleeping in those areas of the station
under the LIRR's jurisdiction. Similar rules are already in
effect in Amtrak's areas of the station.
   Like all social phenomena, homelessness has complex
causes. But the conversion of New York's great transit
terminals into mass dormitories for the homeless does not.
The homeless sleep in the bus and train stations because New
Yorkers let them.

   Three or four decades ago, anyone trying to sleep his
liquor off in a station would have been harshly prodded awake
by a cop and ordered to move along. Now the cop passes him by
-- because he has been told to. A pair of visits to Penn
Station, one in the late afternoon and evening of April 5,
the other in the early morning of April 18, shows some of the
consequences of this new policy.
   ---
   None of the more than 300 homeless sleeping in the station
on the nights I visited resemble even remotely the
sympathetic types featured on the local news -- mothers with
children, working men who couldn't make ends meet.
   Under the social rules that prevail now, though, they have
been tempted into decisions that led them to addiction,
hustling, crime and life on the streets.
   As early as 4:30 in the afternoon, the homeless begin to
congregate along the station's main underground concourse:
clusters of old men drinking cans of Meisterbrau from paper
bags, a few panhandlers and hustlers who scurry away when
they feel the eyes of the police on them. Only one group of a
dozen youngish people has had the nerve to camp out so early.
Its members spread out their sleeping bags and flattened
cardboard boxes in front of a closed-up Bowery Savings Bank
storefront, utterly indifferent to the thousands of commuters
hurtling past their feet.
   I start a conversation with one of them. Why does he sleep
here?
   "I used to go to the Open Door" -- a municipal drop-in
center -- "but it's no good since it stopped being privately
run."
   But why sleep outdoors at all? Why not get a job and a
place of his own? "I don't mind working," he says
defensively. "I used to work construction and just a few
months ago I applied for a job as a janitor at the World
Trade Center -- a good job, $12 an hour. But you can't get
anything without an address."
   Does he take drugs?
   "No way," he insists. "I drink, sure, anything and
everything, but no drugs."
   Did he ever take drugs?
   A pause. "Well, uh, I used to. That's how I got into this
mess." He adds hastily, "But not anymore]"

   According to the LIRR police, roughly one-third of the
homeless people they see have spent time in mental hospitals,
like James Ragin, a big quiet man in his middle 40s. He says
he'd spent years in a mental hospital for the criminally
insane for "burning down a house in Kansas." Why? He shrugged
in boredom. "I wanted to kill everybody in those days."
   Most of the rest of the homeless in the station are either
addicts or drunks -- some completely down and out, others
functioning pretty well. At rush hour, a group of dignified
old men in reasonably clean clothes drinks beer from cans
wrapped in paper bags. It isn't clear whether they are
homeless at all. When asked, one of them replies: "As a
matter of fact, sir, we all have our ups and downs, and right
now I'm on the downs. I'll probably stay here tonight."
   It's the drunks, much more than the addicts, who keep
Pennsylvania Station lively until the early hours of the
morning. Toward midnight, a festive clump of young men and
one pretty young girl are partying noisily near the LIRR
police office. The rowdiest of the group says he is a
construction worker, but he hadn't gone in to work that day:
"Too drunk]" he says happily. "Anyhow, this way I save my
money. Today was payday. If I went in I'd have picked up my
money and it would all be gone now. This way, I save it."
   Meanwhile, the street hustlers are doing business. Near
midnight, a fat, middle-aged lady in spandex pants, her
fingers covered with rings, suitcases gathered around her, is
hunched over, squinting at a watch shown her by a lithe young
man. Almost immediately, she notices she is being watched,
and she hurriedly throws the watch back at the young man. "I
don't know why you show me this. I don't have any money to
give you]" she shrieks.
   The young man looks up and winks. His name is Tony. Where
had he got the watch? He ducks the question. "I love
watches," he smirks, and shows me three strapped to his left
arm. "I always tell a man by his watch. But I don't make my
living selling watches -- I make it from passes." He pulls a
thick sheaf of soiled cardboard from his pocket. "See, it
usually costs $20 to get into a club. But clubs give out
these passes so people can get in for just, like, $5. So I
sell it to you for $5. You save $10; I make $5 -- we're both
ahead. I've got passes for Mars, for MK, for the Palladium,
for any club you want."

   LIRR police arrest records offer something of a
statistical portrait of life in the station. In January, 52
arrests were made there. Most involved homeless people. Nine
of the arrests were for assault or attempted assault; four
were for robbery and six were for petty larceny.
   Only five of 52 arrestees were women. Twenty-eight were
black, 14 were Hispanic and 10 were white. None was Asian.
The average age of the arrestees was 30.2 years.
   Among the January arrestees, police found six people
hiding from warrants, including one for murder. Another was
wanted for violating his parole on a charge of first-degree
murder.
   In February -- the most recent month for which there are
complete figures -- the number of arrests jumped to 150. Six
were women. Ninety-six were black, 26 were Hispanic and 26
were white. By far the single largest category of arrest was
for disorderly conduct, but seven were arrested for assault
or attempted assault, three for petty larceny, two for
attempted grand larceny and one for burglary.
   These numbers suggest that Penn Station is actually quite
a safe place. In fact, Penn Station is not really a place
from which people enter the criminal justice system; it's one
of the places where they go when they are discharged.

   Gloomy ex-cons, many of them now drunks or addicts, hang
around the station, like Hamilton, a heavy-set bald man of 41
leaning face down against a tall garbage bin. His muscles
have slackened somewhat, but he is obviously a tough
character, with enormous hands and a barrel chest. He pulls
up his shirt to show, proudly, a long jagged scar down the
center of his belly. "I was upstate for eight years." He
smiles a mean smile. "I like to take things."
   By two in the morning the station is very quiet. The
sleepers lie in agglomerations in little neighborhoods,
segregated by race and age and invisible hierarchies. "I like
sleeping here," says one old man. "The Port Authority {bus
terminal} is like Sodom and Gomorrah. The commuters are
hard-working people, not like the trash in the bus station."
   A Hispanic "barrio" of about 50 people -- one couple
wrapped together in a blanket shares a hot pink Sony Walkman
-- forms near the border with Amtrak. Hispanic means Puerto
Rican: The LIRR police say they have never found an illegal
alien. "Who comes from Mexico to sleep in a train station?"
   Near the top of the hierarchy is a brisk young man wearing
brilliantly white running shoes. "We're not all bums, you
know. I work. I hold down two jobs -- one at Ticketron, one
as a security guard. I make good money." He pulls a thick wad
of bills out of his pocket. The one on top is a hundred. So
why is he here? "Aw man, if I had an address, my old lady
would find me and make me pay alimony. I'm just 22, I don't
have time for that s---."
   The quiet lasts until 4:30, when the cleaning staff comes
through. At five, the police send the sleepers on their way.
