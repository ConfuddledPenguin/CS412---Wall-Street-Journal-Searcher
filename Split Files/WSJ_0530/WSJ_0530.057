   WASHINGTON -- Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of the Senate Finance
Committee has proposed requiring countries to use some of the
economic aid they receive from the U.S. to buy U.S. goods.
   Along with Sen. David Boren, (D., Okla.), the Texas
Democrat has drafted a bill that would tie U.S. foreign
assistance to increased purchases of U.S. goods. The bill
comes at a time the Bush administration is trying to persuade
countries including Japan, West Germany, Britain, Canada and
France to eliminate such "tied aid."

   The bill's outlook is unclear, but Congress currently is
under pressure to change the way it dispenses foreign aid and
to find ways to increase U.S. exports. It would take effect
in the fiscal year beginning October 1991.
   "It's time to move more aggressively," the finance
chairman said.
