   BRUSSELS -- In an attempt to get a bigger piece of the
booming global express-parcel business, Lufthansa, Japan Air
Lines and Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai Corp. agreed
as expected to buy minority stakes in DHL International Ltd.,
the world's largest air-courier company.
   Patrick Lupo, chief executive officer of DHL
International, said the three partners also are negotiating
to purchase small stakes in DHL Corp., the U.S. arm of the
closely held company.

   According to the agreement, the three companies will buy
equal shares in DHL International, a Hong Kong holding
company run out of Brussels, and Middlestown N.V., a holding
company in Netherlands Antilles. Mr. Lupo said the two
vehicles together control all DHL's international operations,
which have annual revenue of $1.3 billion.
   Initially, Lufthansa and JAL will buy 5% of the stock of
both companies, while Nissho Iwai will take 2.5%. But the
three have options to boost their stakes during the next 18
months. The two airlines can increase their stakes to 25%
each and Nissho Iwai can buy as much as 7.5%.
   In Tokyo, JAL said this total equity stake of 57.5%
represents an investment of about $500 million. DHL and
Lufthansa declined to comment on the figure.
   The deal is subject to various government approvals.
   Mr. Lupo said DHL Corp., the U.S. operation, has revenue
of approximately $500 million a year. He said he believed the
three partners would buy stakes smaller than those they will
take in the international DHL. In any case, U.S. law would
limit foreign investment in DHL Corp. to a total of 25% of
the shares.
   Founded in 1969 by three U.S. entrepreneurs, DHL has grown
to become the world's largest international courier service.
DHL serves 184 countries and carried more than 50 million
shipments in 1989.
   In recent years, the company has faced intense competition
from Federal Express Co. of Memphis, Tenn., United Parcel
Service of America Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., and TNT Ltd. of
Australia. The capital infusion from Lufthansa, JAL and
Nissho Iwai will help DHL keep its competitive edge, analysts
said.
   The new investors also could ease the pressure on DHL to
become a major international air carrier, said Cotton Daly,
director of cargo services of New York consultants Simat,
Helliesen &amp; Eichner Inc. DHL uses its own planes to fly
packages within the U.S. and within Europe, but uses other
airlines to carry its shipments long distances.
   DHL's Mr. Lupo said JAL and Lufthansa together carry less
than 20% of DHL's international shipments. He said the
company intends to continue placing its international
shipments on many airlines, based on price and scheduling.
   For JAL and Lufthansa, the DHL tie-up is a way to gain
easy access to an extensive world-wide distribution network.
For Nissho Iwai, which has vast experience in shipping large
volumes of goods, the deal is a way to gain experience in
small aircargo shipments.
