   PITTSBURGH -- Paul E. Lego's appointment as Westinghouse
Electric Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer,
expected today, could put the company on a growth course.
   Mr. Lego, currently the No. 2 executive, will be taking
over at the helm of the nearly $13 billion corporation at a
crossroads in its 104-year-old history. Westinghouse has
scrambled from perilous litigation stemming from uranium
contracts in the 1970s to prominence among the Dow Jones
Industrials in the 1980s as it chopped underperforming
businesses.

   But now Mr. Lego's challenge will be to selectively expand
what's left, most likely through acquisitions. Under the
current chief executive, John C. Marous Jr., who reaches the
mandatory retirement age of 65 on June 9, Westinghouse
achieved financial success but little focus. Its unrelated
businesses range from broadcasting and financial services to
the manufacture of refrigeration and power generation
equipment.
   Mr. Lego, who has spent 34 of his 60 years at
Westinghouse, isn't giving any hints of what's in store. The
low-profile executive declined to be interviewed for this
story. Moreover, although Mr. Lego has been considered the
heir apparent since his selection as president in January
1988, Westinghouse insiders say he has maintained an even
lower profile this year out of respect for Mr. Marous, in
whose footsteps he has followed for two decades.
   Partly due to the unknowns about Mr. Lego, Wall Street is
already uneasy. Rumors have swirled about possible
acquisition candidates that the executive -- a onetime
electrical engineer and strategic planner -- might be
considering.
   One such candidate is Sundstrand Corp., a $1.6 billion
maker of aerospace parts based in Rockford, Ill.
Westinghouse, which makes radar and other sophisticated
avionics, won't comment on Sundstrand. But analysts don't
rule out the possibility of a bid because of Sundstrand's
strategic fit with Westinghouse. Still, that troubles some
because a third of Sundstrand's revenue comes from the
Pentagon, which likely will spend less for military hardware
in coming years. They also question whether Westinghouse,
which prefers to shop for bargain-priced acquisitions, would
pay a hefty premium for Sundstrand.
   There also is some skittishness about Mr. Lego himself.
Earlier this month, Westinghouse stock tumbled several points
after the executive met with industry analysts in Palm Beach,
Fla. While his outlook wasn't much different from earlier
presentations, some analysts found Mr. Lego to be more
reserved and guarded than Mr. Marous and felt he was
outstaged by counterparts at General Electric Co. and Emerson
Electric Co.
   One of Mr. Lego's biggest supporters, former Westinghouse
Chairman Douglas Danforth, says analysts expected Mr. Lego to
present his vision of where Westinghouse was headed, but Mr.
Danforth said that would have been premature because Mr. Lego
wasn't yet the chairman. "As any CEO, you have a challenge in
convincing the investment community that the company is in
good hands. Paul will be able to handle those things with no
problem," he predicts.
   Robert W. McCoy, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc., told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that "people came away
somewhat concerned about the direction of the company under
new management." Now Mr. McCoy has had second thoughts:
"Paul's personality isn't as outgoing as Danforth or Marous.
We have to get used to his style."
   The son of a steelworker, Mr. Lego was born and raised in
a small town near Johnstown, Pa., where he met his wife at a
square dance.
   He joined Westinghouse in 1956, laboring as an electrical
engineer in relative obscurity until 1970. That year, he
succeeded Mr. Marous as general manager of the company's
semiconductor division.
   In that job, Mr. Lego caught the eye of Mr. Danforth, his
superior. Mr. Danforth says he probably had a hand in five or
six of Mr. Lego's subsequent promotions. "One thing that
impressed me was that he was able to disagree with his
superiors in the right way and he stayed with his beliefs.
Any strong leader has to have those traits if he's to
succeed," Mr. Danforth says.
   Though Mr. Lego has had a long relationship with Mr.
Marous, the two men have sharply contrasting styles. While
traveling on company planes, for example, Mr. Lego is known
for burying himself in paper work. Mr. Marous uses the time
to hold court, summoning subordinates and grilling them one
by one in the seat facing him at the front of the aircraft.
   Unlike Mr. Marous, Mr. Lego isn't one for chit chat.
Maurice C. Sardi, an executive vice president, recalls that
he once sent Mr. Lego a report that was short on substance.
In response, Mr. Lego shot back a sarcastic note. "The key is
that Paul's disciplined and organized," says Mr. Sardi.
"Sometimes guys tend to gloss over things at the senior
level, but he'll pore over the briefing materials. He doesn't
allow anything not to be answered. He's very penetrating."
   The upshot, Mr. Sardi maintains, is that when Mr. Lego
reviews a proposal, "he'll add value, make it better."
   Mr. Lego has been called cold and abrasive. But in a
recent company brochure, he said: "I used to attack people
without thinking too much about how that might be perceived.
Most of us tend to look for people in our mold and view them
more positively than others. I've learned that good people
come in all different molds and temperaments."
   Westinghouse officials claim that Mr. Lego, who starts his
day with a five-mile jog and is at work by 7 a.m., is easy to
work for mostly because he's so disciplined. He encourages
managers to draw up lists of goals, and then works with them
to achieve them. As a result, managers say they always know
where they stand and that Mr. Lego doesn't take credit for
their achievements.
   Mr. Lego shares his view of leadership with a Chinese
philosopher named Lao-tzu. In a speech last June to the
Duquesne Club here, he said Lao-tzu "believed that a leader
is most effective when people don't realize they are being
led. It means that your program has to be so well seated in
the organization that people follow it automatically."
   Now, with Westinghouse at a point where it needs to be
fine-tuned, Mr. Lego is ideally suited for the task at hand,
says Robert F. Pugliese, executive vice president of legal
and corporate affairs. "I've worked for four of
Westinghouse's 13 chairmen," he says. "Paul is the best thing
to happen to us in today's environment. I'm not shilling for
him, I really mean that."
