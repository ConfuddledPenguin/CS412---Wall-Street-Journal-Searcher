   Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading company and
nucleus of the Mitsubishi group, announced Tuesday that in
its fiscal year ended March 31, it posted consolidated net
profit of 60.36 billion yen ($403.1 million), a record high
and up 31% from 46.13 billion yen the year before.
   Citing Japan's continued economic growth, Mitsubishi said
total trading transactions rose 18% in the year, to 18.523
trillion yen from 15.644 trillion yen.

   A sharp rise in crude-oil trades and, reflecting strong
domestic demand, a jump in construction materials and
industrial-machinery sales buoyed the total, the company said
in its financial results.
   The consolidated report, which covered 314 subsidiaries
and 199 affiliated companies, showed gross trading profit
rose 25% to 482.91 billion yen from 386.26 billion yen,
helped by greater trading volume.
   Despite a notable rise in net interest costs and selling,
general and administrative expenses, income from consolidated
operations rose 51% to 42.79 billion yen from 28.39 billion
yen.
