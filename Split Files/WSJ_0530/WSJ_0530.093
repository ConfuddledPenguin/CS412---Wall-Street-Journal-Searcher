   Chicago West Pullman Corp. said it has stopped exploring
its options in connection with a possible new bid to acquire
American Steel &amp; Wire Corp. in light of the company's plans
to pay a special dividend of $4.25 a share.
   In December, Chicago West said it was reviewing its
options after the rejection of a sweetened $9.50-a-share bid
for American Steel.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Chicago West noted, however, that it reserves the right to
buy more shares, or sell shares in the open market or in
private transactions, with third parties. Chicago West did
not disclose its current American Steel stake in the filing.
   American West is based in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio.
