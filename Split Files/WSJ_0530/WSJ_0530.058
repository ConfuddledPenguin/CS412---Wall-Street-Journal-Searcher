   You've heard of weight camp, music camp, drama camp,
tennis camp and even computer camp. Now, there's a yuppie
parent's dream: law camp.
   At National LawCamp, opening this summer in Miami Shores,
Fla., teen campers will be introduced to the basics of the
bar, from how to file a lawsuit to how to try a case. With
proper coaching, they may be able to decide once and for all
whether law is the right profession for them -- and perhaps
even choose their legal specialty, a distinct advantage for
any high school sophomore or junior.

   The three-week July session will offer daylong seminars on
such substantive subjects as the Fourth and Fifth amendments
and the law of torts. There will be field trips to a nearby
courthouse, hikes to a crime lab and, for starry nights
around the campfire, lectures on legal ethics.
   Visiting lecturers will include criminal defense lawyers
and state and federal judges. Staffers from Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center Ltd., the test-review company, will hand
out treats: samples of the Law School Admissions Test.
   The idea, says camp founder Chris Salamone, a Fort
Lauderdale lawyer, is to give young people "an idea at an
early age about whether they really are interested" in the
law. He hopes also to counter what he calls the glamorization
of law through television. "It's not all fast cars and
prizes," he says.
   Mr. Salamone, whose father runs sports camps nationwide,
hopes to teach the young campers how to think like lawyers.
"In law school, there are no answers, only questions,
arguments and analysis," he says. "We want to start them
thinking in this new way."
   So far, 27 teens have signed up, for $1,995 each. Their
parents -- and perhaps the campers themselves -- have been
attracted by such pitches as this from the most recent issue
of Washingtonian magazine: "While other kids are practicing
tennis this summer, yours can be practicing law."
   Kelly Warrick, a high school junior from Stamford, Conn.,
says she spent her camp days last summer at Amherst College,
taking a course called "Comparative Satire in British and
American Literature."
   This summer, she'll switch to law camp because, she says,
she's "interested in the challenge of proving things. Also,
I'm trying to explore my options careerwise now."
