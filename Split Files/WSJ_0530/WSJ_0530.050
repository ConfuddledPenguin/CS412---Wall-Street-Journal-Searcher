   NEW YORK -- John Sculley, chief executive officer of Apple
Computer Inc., sold about $5 million of the company's stock
earlier this month -- apparently continuing a pattern of
option-related sales.
   The 120,000 shares, which represented nearly a third of
his Apple holdings, were acquired through the exercise of
options in October at $7.75 each, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The stock was trading at about
$41.75 a share on the days Mr. Sculley sold, indicating a $4
million profit on the transaction.

   A spokesman for the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker said
Mr. Sculley sold for "personal financial reasons" and
declined to elaborate. Mr. Sculley wasn't available.
   The price of Apple stock has fallen since Mr. Sculley's
sales; it was trading at about $41 a share on the national
over-the-counter market yesterday. Apple was one of several
technology stocks that tumbled Friday after Adobe Systems
Inc. announced that earnings for the quarter ending Friday
would be below analysts' expectations. Apple, whose laser
printers use Adobe software, is Adobe's largest customer.
   Mr. Sculley, who earned about $2.3 million last year,
retains about 265,000 Apple shares, according to SEC filings.
He acquired a total of 374,994 shares when he exercised
options in October.
   Last spring, Mr. Sculley sold 100,000 shares acquired
through the exercise of options for just under $4 million. An
Apple spokeswoman characterized the sale as part of "a
pattern." The executive sold 50,000 shares in 1988 and a
block of more than 100,000 shares in 1986.
   "I don't think there's a signal in the sales," said
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst who follows Apple for First
Boston Corp. He noted that it isn't unusual for Apple
executives to sell stock acquired through the exercise of
options. He added, however, that the year beginning Oct. 1
will be "a make-or-break" year for Apple because of the
scheduled introduction next year of new entry-level Macintosh
computers.

   BULLISH ON PRIMERICA: "If I weren't bullish on Primerica,
I wouldn't have joined the company," said Jeffrey B. Lane,
president of Primerica Corp.'s Primerica Holdings Inc. unit.
   Mr. Lane, who joined the financial company in February,
bought 10,000 shares of the financial-service company's stock
earlier this month, increasing his holdings to 15,000 shares.
Primerica is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Lane resigned from Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. in December after being demoted from the president's
post by the investment bank's then-chairman, Peter A. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen resigned from Shearson, a subsidiary of American
Express Co., in a management shakeup in January.
   The chairman of Primerica, Sanford I. Weill, is a former
chairman and chief executive of Shearson. "I made a lot of
money with Sandy at Shearson, and I have the same high
expectations here," Mr. Lane said.
   He already has made money, on paper at least. According to
SEC filings, he bought the Primerica shares for $29.76 each.
The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at $33 a share.

   DRUG SALES: Executives at Schering Plough Corp., a
pharmaceutical and consumer-product company, are among the
big sellers listed on the table accompanying this story (see
accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 30, 1990). The biggest
sale was by Richard J. Kogan, president, who according to SEC
filings sold nearly $400,000 of stock, about 29% of his
holdings.
   John V. Guigon, vice president and general counsel of the
Madison, N.J., company, sold his entire holding for just over
$200,000, the filings show. Robert G. Weiss, vice president
and controller, sold shares acquired through the exercise of
options for a total of $261,855, according to the filings;
the shares accounted for 94% of his holdings.
   A Schering spokesman said the officers sold "to meet
personal financial obligations" and "top management continues
to have substantial holdings" of company stock.
   The company previously reported a 20% jump in
first-quarter earnings, announced a dividend increase, and
said it expects earnings for the year to be up 18% to 20%
from 1989. "The company is doing very well," said Ronald
Nordmann, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. The sales were
"collectively small. . . . I don't see anything here that
gives me any concern for the future."
   The stock price has risen a since the Schering executives
sold. Mr. Weiss sold his shares May 1 at $82.50 each.
   Mr. Kogan reported his May 9 sale to reflect the effect of
a 2-for-1 stock split payable today to stock of record May 4.
He sold 9,280 post-split shares at $42.50 each (4,640 shares
at $85 each on pre-split basis). Mr. Guigon also reported his
May 8 sale on a post-split basis; he sold 4,736 shares at
$42.375 each (2,368 pre-split shares at $84.75 each).
   Schering-Plough closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $91 each, pre-split.
