<TEXT>
   For slowing down the advance of age,
   I shun vitamins and potions you are trying,
   And stick with my time-tested method
   Of good old-fashioned lying.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   Yard Lines
                                                                                                       

   The tank is full, the blade is sharp,
   So how long will I last?
   Perhaps until the game begins --
   Or I run out of grass.
   -- Charles Ghigna.
