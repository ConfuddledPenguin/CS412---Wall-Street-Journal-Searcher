   BRUSSELS -- Pushed by sharp rises in Britain, Portugal and
Greece, the consumer price index for the 12 European
Community countries rose a preliminary 0.9% in April, faster
than the increases of 0.5% in March and 0.8% a year earlier,
Eurostat, the EC's statistics agency, said.
   The index for the EC as a whole, which is weighted to
reflect consumption of household goods in each EC country,
rose 5.4% in the 12 months through April, higher than the
4.7% increase in the U.S. and the 2.4% rise in Japan for the
same period. Eurostat said a 3% surge in Britain's index for
April -- the highest since 3.4% in April 1980 -- accounted
for a large part of the EC-wide increase. Greece's index rose
1.7% and Portugal's 1.2%.

   Britain's inflation figures for April normally reflect the
consequences of measures announced in the British budget,
Eurostat said, but this year, they were pushed up by the
introduction of the community charge, or so-called poll tax,
on adults; rises in excise duties on alcohol, tobacco, and
gasoline; and increases in public utilities, rents and
seasonal food costs.
