   MESQUITE, Texas -- Before undergoing life-threatening
cancer surgery in 1985, Ruth Kaun says, "I opened my heart to
the Lord." As a result, she says, she survived.
   She also added some new stops to her Christmas shopping
trips. This week, on a gift-buying spree at the sprawling
Town East Mall here, Ms. Kaun shunned Victoria's Secret and
other glamorous stores in favor of two religious retailers,
Heavenly Gifts and Family Bookstore. "Faith is the most
valuable gift I have to share," says the elementary-school
teacher, buying a silver angel at Heavenly Gifts.

   Ms. Kaun's experience shows why purveyors of religious
goods are enjoying a merrier Christmas than most other
retailers: Adversity -- whether it be cancer, an economic
downturn or the threat of war -- tends to awaken spiritual
impulses, and spiritual impulse buying. William Graham,
director of Baptist Book Stores, based in Nashville, Tenn.,
says the chain grew during the Depression. Fred Cook, manager
of Catholic Arts &amp; Gifts in Dallas, says: "The busiest time
we ever had was during the Cuban missile crisis."
   "The rule of thumb," says Michael Becker, owner of
Donnelly's religious-goods store in Kansas City, Mo., "is
that when times are good, business is good. When times are
bad, business is better."
   Sales gains this Christmas range from 12% to more than 30%
at the two dozen Christian retailers surveyed so far by
William Anderson, president of the Christian Booksellers
Association, which represents 3,000 stores with mostly
Protestant customers. The National Church Goods Association,
which represents sellers of Catholic goods, says its members
report similar results.
   Part of that success may stem from a shift in
merchandising strategy. In earlier crises, Christian stores
carried mostly devotional items, reflecting the belief that
prayer alone could solve all problems. But today, they are
full of inspirational books and videos describing how to deal
with hard times. Growing especially fast is a line of
Christian fiction portraying believers struggling with
real-life problems.
   "The attitude used to be that if you loved the Lord and
lived a clean life, you wouldn't have any problems," says Mr.
Anderson. "But now our products are geared more and more
toward helping people deal with loneliness, anxiety, job
insecurity and marital problems."
   In a category known in the trade as "holy hardware," a
relatively new product called Kneeling Santa (Mr. Claus
himself, on his knees before a creche) is hot this year. But
so are old standbys such as crucifixes, Jesus portraits and
medals featuring St. Christopher, patron saint of travelers.
"People are buying lots of St. Christopher medals for
soldiers in the Middle East," says Sylvia Tillotson, owner of
Heavenly Gifts.
   Fashion is also popular. Customers are snapping up
T-shirts featuring a weight lifter and the words "God's Gym,"
as well as baseball caps that say "Jesus Saves."
   Meanwhile, parents are buying Noah's Ark sets, biblical
puzzles and "action figures" such as Jonah and the Whale for
their kids. "Children's products are our fastest-growing
category," says George Buck, president of Family Bookstores,
the nation's largest Christian chain, with 128 stores and
sales of more than $70 million.
   The Christian-goods industry has taken on a higher profile
in recent years, increasingly operating out of upscale malls
beside some of the biggest names in retailing. And it
features players as established as Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., owner of the Family Bookstores chain.
   The higher profile, coupled with the growth of
fundamentalist Christianity, caused industry sales to triple
to more than $3 billion a year in the 1980s. General-interest
stores such as Waldenbooks have responded by giving more
space to religious books, whose sales nearly doubled to $737
million in 1989 from 1982, according to the American
Booksellers Association.
   Shoppers seeking spiritual solace also can find good deals
at Christian stores. Books of comparable size cost $2 to $5
less in Christian stores than in mainstream stores, and other
items are generally lower priced, too, says Mr. Anderson of
the Christian Booksellers Association. "Merchants in this
business have traditionally operated with narrower margins,"
he says.
   The reason: Their quest for profit is tempered by their
missionary zeal. Although that's especially true at
church-run stores, it's also the case at Rupert Murdoch's
Family Bookstores chain, an all-denominational Christian
store that seeks not only profits but converts.
   Promoting Jesus in shopping malls "is part of our
corporate mission," says Family Bookstores' Mr. Buck.
Although Mr. Murdoch's newspapers are known more for
titillating photographs than for spirituality, his company,
which acquired Family Bookstores as part of Harper &amp; Row, "is
supportive" of its evangelistic mission, says Mr. Buck.
   Many customers seem to be pursuing missionary goals as
well, buying gifts for unconverted acquaintances who face
difficulties. "In hard times, what could be more reassuring
than a gift that says, `Jesus loves you'?" asks Janice
Robinson, a Mesquite teacher. "And at Christmastime, what
could be more appropriate?"
