   AMSTERDAM -- Led by strong growth in the non-food sector,
Dutch retail sales in October climbed 9.6% from a year
earlier, the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics said.
   Though non-food retail sales rose 12% in October, sales at
department stores were up just 2%, continuing to lag behind
those of other retailers, as they have all year.
