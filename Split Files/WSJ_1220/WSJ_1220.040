   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., citing
concern over hostile takeover activity in the electronics
industry, strengthened its anti-takeover provisions.
   The computer maker said it reduced to 10% the amount of
Sun stock that a buyer must purchase before triggering a
"poison pill" that would dilute the buyer's holdings. Sun's
anti-takeover agreement previously set the trigger point at a
20% acquisition.

   William Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, said the
move wasn't a response to any specific takeover attempt
directed at Sun, but that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Corp.'s hostile takeover bid for NCR Corp. "certainly
focussed peoples' attention on these issues."
   Sun's anti-takeover provisions now give the holder of each
Sun share the right to buy another share at half the market
value if a person or group acquires 10% or more of Sun's
stock without the company's agreement. Sun said the amendment
won't affect AT&amp;T's 19% holding in Sun as long as the phone
company honors the terms of its stock-purchase agreement
which forbids AT&amp;T from buying more than 20% of Sun until
1998.
