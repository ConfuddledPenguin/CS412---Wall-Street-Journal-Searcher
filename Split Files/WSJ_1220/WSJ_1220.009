   WASHINGTON -- A White House council headed by Vice
President Quayle used its muscle to kill a government
proposal for trash recycling just days before it was to go
into effect.
   Opposition from the vice president's Competitiveness
Council led the Environmental Protection Agency to drop a
proposed regulation that would have required municipal waste
incinerators to recycle at least 25% of the trash destined
for burning.

   The regulation would have imposed the first federal rules
mandating recycling of the nation's trash. But the
requirement also stirred complaints from the business
community that reregulation is on the rise under President
Bush.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said the action doesn't
mean the Bush administration is reneging on the president's
campaign commitment to reduce waste through recycling.
"Everyone in the administration remains committed to
recycling," Mr. Reilly said in an interview.
   Mr. Reilly said the panel concluded that it was
inappropriate to enact a major recycling requirement as part
of a broader rule designed to curb air pollution from the
scores of incinerators that now burn 14% of municipal waste
in the U.S. After stripping out the recycling provisions, the
remainder of the air-pollution regulation will be issued and
put into effect later this month, Mr. Reilly said. And
recycling ideas will be considered next year when Congress
reauthorizes the nation's principal waste-disposal law, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   Opposition to the recycling measure, however, wasn't
merely on technical grounds. Michael Deland, chairman of the
president's Council on Environmental Quality, said many panel
members felt that voluntary recycling works best and "we
don't want to force it down people's throats."
   The recycling rule also was strongly opposed by the
National League of Cities. The group objected to it being
mandatory and said that it would be harder to get sites
approved for new incinerators to handle the nation's mounting
trash problem.
   Also opposing the rule was the waste-handling industry,
which includes companies like Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.
and a subsidiary of Ogden Corp. that make incinerators that
burn trash to make energy.
   This was the first time that Mr. Quayle's obscure panel,
which was created to stop rules that stifle industry, has
intervened to block a regulation. The panel is the successor
to the deregulation task force Mr. Bush had headed as vice
president during the Reagan years.
   The aggressive recycling initiative was the highlight of
the broader air-pollution rule that the EPA proposed for
incinerators last December after getting clearance from the
Office of Management and Budget.
   While the Quayle commission is only an advisory panel,
officials said there was so much opposition to the recycling
proposal within the administration that the EPA had little
choice but to agree to strip it out.
   A White House official said Mr. Reilly was the only
official to speak in favor of the proposal at the
cabinet-level meeting. The official said Mr. Quayle also
stated at the meeting that the administration continues to
support recycling.
   The panel's actions suggest, however, that the
administration will find it hard to deliver on the
president's campaign commitment to recycling and the EPA's
goal of reducing the nation's waste 25% by 1992.
   "Dropping this element from the rule sort of cuts the legs
out from under that campaign promise, and it leaves everyone
wondering how the administration will meet its commitment to
make recycling more than a slogan," said Eric Goldstein, a
lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. A lawsuit
by the council, an environmental group, forced the EPA to
draw up the incinerator air-pollution regulations.
Environmentalists widely supported the recycling requirement.
