   Tokyo stocks surged Wednesday on expectations of lower
Japanese and U.S. interest rates, sparked by the half-point
cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5%, traders said.
   In London, futures-motivated buying and a year-end
shortage of stock in many of the blue-chip leaders pulled the
broadbased index higher.

   Despite widespread gains, Tokyo prices were off from
intraday highs on selling related to the expiration of
futures contracts on the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange, or Simex, traders said.
   More significantly, institutional investors repeatedly
entered the market to sell into the rally, which was led by
advances on blue-chip shares, they said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues was up 452.76
points at 24876.78.
   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei Index was up 455.60
to 24879.62.
   In trading early Thursday, the Nikkei Index was down
124.87 to 24751.91.
   Volume on the first section Wednesday was estimated at 620
million shares, up from 382.1 million shares Tuesday.
   Winning issues outnumbered losing issues 686 to 278, while
171 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section advanced 30.93 points, or 1.7%, to 1821.41.
   The second section index fell 3.33 points, or 0.1%, to
close at 2846.78.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at 5.6 million
shares, up from 4.6 million shares Tuesday.
   Mike Kawakami, senior trader at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.,
said that Simex futures-linked unwinding between 24500 and
25000 on the Nikkei cash index during the afternoon and at
the close was partly responsible for the index's inability to
sustain intraday gains.
   "We saw some sizable selling pressure from institutions
selling into the rally," Mr. Kawakami said. Large-capital
issues that have led the market's recent rally closed lower
on heavy volume because of profit-taking pressure, he said.
   He added that although the market's supply side still
looms over its demand side, there are some investment trusts,
margin investors and institutions shopping for bargains at
lower levels.
   Hopes for softer Japanese monetary policy have been
sparking buying in interest rate-sensitive issues during the
early December rally. Steel and shipbuilding shares have been
consistent volume leaders, gaining on support from investment
trust funds and brokerage houses.
   But Wednesday, major blue-chip shares, rather than
domestic issues, saw the real activity. Mr. Kawakami said
that the yen's level also encouraged some buying of
export-oriented companies.
   "The only factor that will assure a year-end rally is an
official discount rate lowering" by the Bank of Japan
following the Fed's move, said Mr. Kawakami. The central
bank, however, remains unwavering in its cautious stance,
with an official saying Wednesday that the Fed's easing
"won't have any impact on Bank of Japan policy."
   Blue-chip issues, along with banking and other financial
stocks, were higher Wednesday.
   Sony rose 170 yen ($1.28) to 6,230 yen, TDK added 180 yen
to 4,490 yen, Fanuc rose 120 yen to 4,620 yen and Kyocera
gained 130 yen to 5,840 yen. Pioneer advanced 170 yen to
4,120 yen. Mitsubishi Bank soared 170 yen to 2,300 yen,
Mitsubishi Trust rose 110 yen to 1,790 yen, Sanwa Bank jumped
170 yen to 2,080 yen and Fuji Bank rose 140 yen to 2,450 yen.
   Ending mostly lower, steel and shipbuilding stocks were
the day's volume leaders. Nippon Steel fell 5 yen to 445 yen,
Sumitomo Metal dropped 2 yen to 469 yen, and NKK fell 3 yen
to 416 yen.
   On Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted data
regarding stock-futures arbitrage trading during the week
ended Dec. 14.
   The number of short cash positions held at the end of the
week totaled 288.1 million, amounting to 352.75 billion yen.
The number of long positions totaled 227.5 million, amounting
to 254.33 billion yen.
   As of Dec. 14, the number of short cash positions held
against March futures contracts rose from zero to 37.4
million. The amount came to 42.59 billion yen.
   The number of long cash positions held against March
futures contracts increased 285.1 million to 343.7 million,
marking a 322.39 billion-yen increase to 387.34 billion yen.
   In London, traders said several factors combined to propel
prices upward.
   These included valuation arguments that London shares look
cheap on an international level, the weight of institutional
liquidity and the likely good news in the new year that
interest rates will be coming down. Market watchers also said
that by factoring in the potential for a peaceful settlement
in the Middle East, shares could move significantly higher in
the short term.
   "All the sellers have been scared away," said Nick Knight,
equity strategist at Nomura Research Institute in London.
"All of a sudden the market is looking squeezed. It wouldn't
take much to push it higher, which would only exacerbate the
shortage of stock," he said.
   At the closing bell, the closely watched Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was up 16.9 points at
2178.7.
   In the futures market, the December FT-SE 100-Share Index
contract settled at 2193.0 on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, up from its Tuesday settlement
level of 2178.5.
   At its latest calculation, the narrower FT 30-Share Index
was up 12.9 points at 1707.1. Volume registered a moderate
509.3 million shares.
   In corporate developments, Pilkington, a U.K. glass
manufacturer, added 10 pence (19 cents) to 182 pence on news
that major industrial conglomerate BTR raised its stake in
Pilkington to just over 4%.
   A total of 7.5 million Pilkington shares traded while 1.8
million BTR shares changed hands. BTR closed 3 pence higher
at 335.
   Banking shares, which have been recently laboring under
fairly sizable downgrades, bounced back in moderate dealings.
Barclays added 7 to 360; National Westminster gained 6 to
270; Lloyds was unchanged at 282; Midland closed unchanged at
198.
   Wellcome shares showed the largest advance of any FT-SE
100 stock at the end of trading, gaining 20 to 463 on
turnover of 1.1 million shares. Dealers said the stock was in
demand in anticipation of an analysts' meeting this week that
is expected to be bullish for the company.
   In early morning trading Wednesday, the Hang Seng was up
12.43 points to 3079.08.
   Elsewhere Tuesday, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt
and Madrid; lower in Paris, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan;
and mixed in Zurich, Amsterdam. South African gold stocks
closed lower.
   Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Manila and Wellington,
lower in Singapore, Taipei and Seoul, and little changed in
Sydney.
