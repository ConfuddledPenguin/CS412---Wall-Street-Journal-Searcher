   SIERRA CAPITAL Cos., San Francisco, said that one of the
real estate investment trusts it manages, the Sierra Capital
Realty Trust IV fund, won't pay a fourth-quarter dividend,
citing the trust's expected loss of two major tenants next
year, among other factors. It also said that because of
"obvious uncertainties caused by the current economic
climate," three of its trusts will evaluate their dividends
in February meetings, "which would likely result in a
reduction of dividends." These funds are Sierra Real Estate
Equity Trust '83, Sierra Capital Realty Trust VII and Sierra
Capital Realty Trust VIII. Sierra Capital Reality Trust VI
may reduce or increase its dividend in February, the company
said, depending on the outcome of a review.
