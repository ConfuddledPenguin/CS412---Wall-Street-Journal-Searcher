   Last Christmas, Earl Havlock of Ashland, N.H., was hailed
as a living Santa Claus. In a widely reported heartwarming
story, Mr. Havlock gave the $8.9 million he won in the New
Hampshire lottery to his older brother, Elwood.
   Today, Earl wants his money back.

   In a lawsuit filed against his brother, Earl, 43 years
old, claims he didn't really mean to hand his winnings over
to Elwood, 50. Rather, he now claims, the so-called gift was
an attempt to trick authorities and the general public so
that Earl, an epileptic, could continue receiving about $300
a month in Social Security benefits.
   "That story about brotherly love and the spirit of
Christmas was a great story," says Robert Foley, Earl's
attorney. "Unfortunately that's not the whole story."
   A year ago, this account was given:
   Two days before Christmas, Earl bought a $1 lottery ticket
at Luff's Corner Cupboard, a general store in Ashland, and
discovered a few minutes later that he had won the large sum.
Overjoyed, he called Elwood from the store, asking him to
collect his Christmas present. When Elwood arrived, "Earl
said to him, `Merry Christmas, brother,'" reported Patricia
Vallieres, the store owner.
   "People from around the country called to ask: `Is that
true? Did he really give the money away?'" says Malcolm
Taylor, a reporter for the Evening Citizen, who broke the
story. "Apparently we were all the victims of a charade."
   What really happened, according to the suit, was that the
two brothers agreed, at least orally, to split the money six
ways, including shares for four other siblings.
   The first of the 20 annual installments -- amounting to
$357,600 after taxes -- was paid last December to Elwood.
Since then, he has given some money to family members, but
"significantly less than the one-sixth agreed to," Mr. Foley
contends.
   Meanwhile, Elwood's wife, Rowena, has filed for divorce,
asking for half the jackpot. Fearing he could lose millions
of dollars in a divorce settlement, Earl filed suit, claiming
he was duped by his brother into duping the public.
   "He's unsophisticated, he's gullible," Mr. Foley says of
Earl. "He doesn't know much about the value of money. Some
people might think, `Gee, he must be crazy to give up $8.9
million for a $300 monthly check.'"
   Elwood's attorney, Stephen Kain, declined to comment,
saying he plans to file a response to the complaint next
month.
