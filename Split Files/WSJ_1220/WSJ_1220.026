   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc., a
retirement and recreational communities developer that sought
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code on Oct. 3, said it received bankruptcy-court
permission to borrow as much as $13.5 million through April
30 under a revolving credit agreement with Security Pacific
Bank Arizona.
   The company said the borrowings will be secured by liens
on certain contract receivables, real estate and other assets
of Fairfield and its units.
