   NEW YORK -- The CBS network said it signed a long-term
agreement with the husband-wife team of Harry Thomason and
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creators and executive producers
of the CBS series "Designing Women" and "Evening Shade," to
create five new prime-time series.
   The CBS Inc. unit said the deal with the couple's Mozark
Productions Inc. is the "largest and most comprehensive
production commitment" it has ever made with a single
production company, but it didn't elaborate.

   The eight-year deal calls for the duo to be exclusive to
CBS for the first three years of the pact. After that, CBS
gets a first look at any project. One of the five series
commitments will be produced by CBS's in-house production
unit.
