   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- On soundstages at the Columbia
Pictures Entertainment lot, construction crews are building a
pirate ship the size of an ocean liner and a gargantuan,
multitiered tree house for the set of "Hook," an updated
treatment of "Peter Pan." Appropriately, the "absolutely no
visitors" signs posted all around the sets are marked with
skull and crossbones.
   Although the production of "Hook" is cloaked in secrecy,
it is already the most talked-about movie in Hollywood -- and
it may turn out to be among the most expensive movies ever
made here. Depending on who's talking, the compensation deal
struck with its stars, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, and
director Steven Spielberg will either produce the next "E.T."
megahit or the 1990s version of "Heaven's Gate," moviedom's
biggest and most expensive flop.

   After nearly a decade of abandoned efforts by Mr.
Spielberg and studios such as Paramount Pictures and Walt
Disney Co. to make a modern day version of the tale of the
boy who could fly, "Hook" is scheduled to open next
Christmas, a production of the Tri-Star Pictures division of
Columbia, which was purchased by Sony Corp. last year.
   Powerful Creative Artists Agency, which represents Messrs.
Spielberg, Hoffman and Williams, negotiated an agreement that
will pay its clients roughly 40% of the movie's gross revenue
from all markets, including theatrical, video, television and
merchandising. Although the percentage varies, it can go as
high as 50% at some revenue levels.
   "Hook" -- starring Mr. Hoffman as the evil pirate Captain
Hook, Mr. Williams as the grown-up Peter Pan and Julia
Roberts as a buxom, talking Tinkerbelle -- isn't the first
movie deal that gives a big chunk of the proceeds away up
front. Two years ago, Thomas Pollock, the newly arrived head
of MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios, set tongues wagging when he
agreed to pay Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito 35% to
40% of the proceeds to get them to make "Twins," a deal that
other stars soon sought to imitate. But "Twins" cost only
about $16 million to produce; with box office revenue at
about $150 million, Universal says it made hefty profits for
the actors and the studio.
   Although "Hook" has the potential to become a blockbuster,
its much higher cost and the escalation clauses for the
director and actors will make it tough for the studio to make
much of a profit. "Hook" is currently budgeted at $40 million
to $45 million, but industry executives predict special
effects and other costs could bring the final tally closer to
$50 million to $60 million. The most conservative estimate by
rival studios that have studied the project is that "Hook"
will have to sell $125 million of tickets just to break even.
   Tri-Star also had to pay a reported $1.7 million to
producers Jerry Weintraub and Dodi Fayed to buy out a project
they had started after obtaining certain rights to the Pan
tale from London's Hospital for Sick Children, to which Sir
James Matthew Barrie, author of "Peter Pan," bequeathed the
rights. Messrs. Weintraub and Fayed also get an executive
producer credit on "Hook," even though they have had nothing
to do with the film.
   Another $850,000 and a small percentage of profits went to
Nick Castle, the director replaced by Mr. Spielberg. Indeed,
the only remaining member of the original team that developed
"Hook" is Jim Hart, who wrote the script in 1986.
   CAA declines to discuss the terms of its clients' deal.
But Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, dismisses
most of the industry talk as "jealousy." He says the deal
enables the studio to recoup its costs, but acknowledges the
movie will have to do $100 million at the box office to break
even. Still, he says, the movie is "a slam-dunk" for success,
and worth the risk. "We got a very good deal on this project
and everyone is going to make money," he says. "We'd never
have made this deal under any circumstances if we didn't
think we could make a profit."
   For Tri-Star and parent Sony, a new -- albeit rich -- kid
on the block in Hollywood, there may be reasons other than
profit for making the "Hook" deal. "They made a strategic
decision to show that they could be in business with a
director and stars of this caliber, no matter what the cost,"
says one executive involved in the transaction.
   "Hook" also makes a splash for Mr. Medavoy, who has moved
quickly to pump up Tri-Star production in the six months
since he was recruited by new Columbia Co-Chairmen Peter
Guber and Jon Peters. Tri-Star's production had fallen off
sharply after Sony acquired it and overhauled management.
Earlier this month, Mr. Medavoy officially unveiled a slate
of new projects and development deals that include such
high-priced talent as Warren Beatty, Sylvester Stallone, Al
Pacino and Robert DeNiro.
   Sony and its movie executives have ambitious plans for
"Hook." Together with Amblin Entertainment, Mr. Spielberg's
production concern, Tri-Star is already working on a
world-wide marketing campaign and dreaming up merchandising
ploys that include joint promotions with a major fast-food
chain, a toy company, and a publishing concern. Longer term,
Columbia officials envision reusing Captain Hook's pirate
ship and the tree house that is the central set for
Never-Never Land in a "Sonyland" theme park the company may
build in Southern California.
   For Mr. Spielberg and Amblin, whose biggest successes have
been such fantasy-adventure films as "E.T." and "Raiders of
the Lost Ark," making "Hook" is the culmination of a long
interest in the Peter Pan story. Mr. Spielberg and his team
worked with Paramount Pictures in the early 1980s on a
project that would have been set in modern day Ohio. But
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Amblin, says they were
reluctant to tamper too much with the original story, and
"arrived at a point where we didn't have a script we really
wanted to make and just sort of drifted away."
   Writer Jim Hart had come up with his own idea for a modern
Peter Pan tale in 1986, after his son Jake posed the
question: "What if Peter Pan grew up?" Mr. Hart, who hadn't
had a script produced, found that certain rights to the story
had entered the public domain in 1988, and came up with a
grown-up, stressed-out, overachieving Yuppie descendant of
Peter, who must journey to Never-Never Land to save his
children after Captain Hook returns from the fantasy world to
steal them away.
   Producers Gary Adelson and Craig Baumgarten introduced Mr.
Hart to director Nick Castle, and together they set up the
project at Tri-Star with then-president Jeff Sagansky. Before
the script was finished, however, Mr. Sagansky left to take
over as head of CBS Entertainment. Mr. Medavoy inherited
"Hook," and decided to go ahead with it.
   Mr. Medavoy says he immediately went to Mr. Hoffman, who
had been interested in playing Hook in another proposed
version of Peter Pan, and to Mr. Williams. Mr. Medavoy also
sent the script to Mr. Spielberg to try to get him to direct
it. Ms. Kennedy of Amblin says Mr. Spielberg fell in love
with the script's "child in all of us" concept.
   One complication, of course, was that the film already had
a director: Mr. Castle, also a CAA client. Mr. Castle was
made an unusually lucrative offer to turn the project over to
Mr. Spielberg.
   Although Mr. Medavoy maintains the deal isn't a "CAA
package," the agency clearly negotiated an astonishing deal
for its clients, one that some worry will inflate already
out-of-control demands by Hollywood talent. But supporters
note that the combination of Spielberg, Williams and Hoffman
required an unusual compensation plan, and Tri-Star had to
agree to their terms if it wanted to get the movie made.
"Even if `Hook' is a big home run for the studio, it won't be
enormously profitable for them," says one executive familiar
with the deal. "But it could give them enormous credibility."
