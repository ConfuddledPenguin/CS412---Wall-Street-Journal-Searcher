   Paris -- Stepping out on the terrace of the Musee d'Orsay,
high above the Seine and the chestnut ramble of the Tuileries
Gardens and beneath a raft of white and silver clouds, you
see the landscape of the impressionists whose canvases are
fixed directly behind in the galleries you have just left.
   A Frenchman I know protests he is "scandalized" by the way
the Monets and the Pisarros and the Sisleys are hung there,
crowded together on dull gray walls in ill-lit rooms,
lacking, in short, the eclat they had when they could be seen
in the Jeu de Paume.

   It is hard to know what is right any more about such
paintings after having been imprisoned so long by their
fashion, a fashion that has focused a preponderant attention
on the art of late-19th-century France. We have been kept
staring at the same few painters for 50 years now as their
prices have soared into the tens of millions of dollars.
   Still, that is not the fault of the Musee d'Orsay. In
fact, once up off the ground, the visitor becomes happily
lost in the iron beams and the industrial glass of the
suburban railroad station the place once was. The great
luminous clocks that face the Seine are still the glory of
the art nouveau facade: Now you can squint out at Paris from
behind the huge hands and heroic Roman numerals.
   Across the rue de Bellechasse stands a quite different
museum, that of the Legion d'Honneur, tucked away behind the
serene neoclassic facades of the Hotel Salm, a good place to
go after the hubbub of the Musee d'Orsay. The exhibits
consist, very restfully, of ribbons and medals and
memorabilia of Napoleon I, who founded the order. There are
other displays of earlier orders of the old monarchy, notably
the order of the Holy Ghost, the one with the blue sash or
cordon bleu, familiar to all those who know the portraits of
the Bourbon kings. A connoisseur's item is a full-length
tapestry representation of the Emperor Napoleon III stepping
forward from what looks like a great ermine bathrobe.
   The Hotel Salm, which ironically was finished in 1789 and
survived the revolution only to be burned by the Commune, was
restored by the Legion of Honor and taken for its
headquarters. Its shallow dome adorned with statues looks,
leaffringed, across the Seine. Its handsomely proportioned
windows, sweeping to the gleaming parquet of the floor, are
themselves swept with thickly lined curtains of yellow silk.
   Could we visit the rest of the building, now that our tour
of the museum's few rooms is finished? "Only 25 visitors a
month," snaps the secretary from behind her formidable lobby
desk, her blue-gray eyes snapping in time. "We are already
subscribed fully for this month. If you wish to put your name
down, it will be for the next visit six weeks hence."
   "Remember, only 25 visitors at a time. Monsieur le
Chancelier is most inflexible on this point and there shall
be no exceptions," she continued. Perhaps it's a good idea.
The prehistoric cave at Lascaux had to close after only 30
years because of the pollution caused by an excessive number
of human visitors.
   Up at the corner of the rue de Bellechasse and the
Boulevard St. Germain, there is an elegant butcher shop next
to the bus stop. I watched the young butcher bone a leg of
lamb, neat as a surgeon, twirling it around with string,
finishing smartly with a single, snapped-off knot, and then
setting down on the wide wooden block before him a
rose-mahogany bundle of admirable meat geometrically laced
with white.
   An elderly couple was studying this ritual with fierce
attention. It was their meat he was preparing of course,
leaning over the glass counter as the lamb was juggled to the
scale to be weighed, tossed on a paper and wrapped
cracklingly for the cashier, an aloof, white-haired woman,
seated high at her counter.
   The butcher at once released himself into another sequence
of graceful clockwork, fencing and flicking his knife around
a large lump of white fat, which he soon transformed into a
succulent veal kidney, again tied and trimmed -- just so] And
here was the No. 68 bus.
