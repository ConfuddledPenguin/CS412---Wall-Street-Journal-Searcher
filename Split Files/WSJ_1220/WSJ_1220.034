   A sustained drop in fixed-mortgage rates to the lowest
level in nearly four years has failed so far to boost sagging
home sales.
   According to a survey of 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates
of Butler, N.J., the average 30-year rate as of last Friday
had fallen to 9.66%, the lowest since April 1987, when it was
9.5%. But real-estate agents and builders around the country
are reporting little or no new movement in the residential
market. And they expect little change until the underlying
causes of consumer concern -- high home prices in some areas,
battered regional economies, fears of a serious national
recession and the Persian Gulf crisis -- are resolved one way
or another.

   "Everybody is scared to death to make a move in any
direction," said Alfred Gobar, a real-estate consultant in
Brea, Calif.
   Of course, housing isn't dead in all parts of the country.
Homes are still relatively easy to sell in certain areas,
particularly in the Northwest and Midwest. Moreover, analysts
agree that lower interest rates have to be regarded as a
longer-term positive for the market. But right now, they
aren't sufficient to overcome the uncertainties that have
walloped housing sales on both coasts and sent housing starts
plunging. Indeed, a government survey indicates that the
average fixed-rate mortgage available this year will be the
lowest in 12 years, but home sales nonetheless shrank
significantly.
   The Commerce Department reported yesterday that overall
starts were up 9% for November, but the increase was
concentrated in apartment construction while single-family
starts dropped to their lowest level in eight years. If
current trends persist, some economists predict overall
starts for 1991 will fall to a post-war low well under one
million units.
   Even though the lowered interest rates have failed to
jump-start the housing market, prospective buyers are showing
more interest. Jim Arnold, vice president of sales for The
Mortgage Market, a northern California lender offering a
9.25% fixed rate with 2.5 points, said more people are
calling in for information about the rates but have yet to
act.
   "It starts with the phone calls and people asking a lot of
questions," Mr. Arnold said. "Then, usually, they come in two
weeks later and ask for a loan."
   Randall W. Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes,
a builder in California and Nevada, said the interest rates
have drawn more people to the company's sales lots -- though
not to buy.
   "They come in saying, `We're just checking. We want to
make sure the time is right,'" Mr. Lewis said.
   A few agents and builders report improved sales because of
sharply falling prices. In Boston, Douglas Bray, president of
Century 21 Cityside, said his sales are up 25% from last year
due to lower prices and reduced inventory. He added that the
lowered interest rates have been instrumental in not impeding
sales.
   Lower interest rates aren't nearly as important as they
were eight years ago when the fixed rate dropped down from a
peak in the upper-teens, invigorating home sales, said J.
Larry Sorsby, vice president of finance for Hovnanian
Enterprises, a Red Bank, N.J., builder of less-expensive
homes. Today's rate, while favorable, is still only a
drop-off from the 10- to 11-point range, which was also
favorable, Mr. Sorsby said.
   "Certainly, lower interest rates will help," Mr. Sorsby
said. "But the Northeast has been hit pretty hard with the
layoffs on Wall Street, combined with lower job growth and
the Mideast crisis."
   More than anything else, the lower interest rates provide
a necessary foundation for the market's eventual recovery.
Lower home prices are the other ingredient for recovery,
along with a restoration of consumer confidence. Some
industry officials feel the lowered rates, in and of
themselves, can help bring buyers' confidence back on track.
   "It will help restore some confidence in the housing
market with the prospect that interest rates are pretty good
and things are okay," said Harley E. Rouda, a Columbus, Ohio,
realtor and president of the National Association of
Realtors.
