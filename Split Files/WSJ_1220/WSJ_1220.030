   MOSCOW -- President Mikhail Gorbachev, in the clearest
sign yet of his growing authoritarian mood, declared that he
will bypass local authorities and introduce direct
presidential rule in areas where events "pose a serious
threat to the state."
   The Soviet leader's remarks to the Congress of People's
Deputies, the supreme national legislature, seem sure to
aggravate an already bitter battle between the Kremlin and
the nation's 15 republics over the future structure of the
Soviet Union.

   Only a few hours before Mr. Gorbachev spoke, Boris
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, attacked the
Kremlin for ignoring the republics' sovereign rights and
accused it of "seeking to keep its absolute power at any
cost."
   "Russia does not agree with the creation of a dictatorship
of the Kremlin," Mr. Yeltsin said, adding that Soviet leaders
seemed to be motivated by "a mad rage" against the republics.
   Brushing off such criticism, which has been echoed by
other republican leaders at the congress, Mr. Gorbachev said
he was worried about growing nationalism and ethnic conflicts
in the republics of Moldavia and Georgia, and was "extremely
concerned" about events in the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
   "I would like to stress that where the situation becomes
especially tense and there is a serious threat to the state
and to people's well-being, I will have to introduce a state
of emergency or presidential rule," he said to enthusiastic
applause from the largely conservative Congress.
   "In such a situation, I think the president will have to
take full responsibility on himself, because my attempts to
reach an agreement on working together end up by us not being
able to agree," he added.
   Over the past few days, Mr. Gorbachev has frequently
called for discipline and the restoration of law and order.
At the congress, he took issue with critics of his new
stance, describing them as being motivated by "a populism
with rotten roots."
   He spoke shortly after 53 deputies, including several
top-ranking military leaders, issued an appeal for the
president to clamp down on "separatism" and "subversive
anti-state activity."
   "Perestroika is bogged down in ruinous darkness," the
appeal said, adding that the West would understand any tough
measures that were taken. "You will be resolutely supported
by the leaders of world politics who no longer dread the
U.S.S.R. as a totalitarian superpower, but fear that
fragments of the collapsing colossus could destabilize the
world order," it added.
   Behind such rhetoric lies a growing fear in the Soviet
establishment that their powers are being usurped by leaders
of the republics. Local authorities throughout the nation
have recently ignored or directly contradicted numerous
decrees issued by Mr. Gorbachev on restoring order and
stabilizing the economy.
   The Soviet president says disarray is a result of his lack
of executive powers, and he is seeking to persuade the
congress to give him more direct authority. At the same time,
he has made some token concessions to the republics in a new
union treaty that the congress is discussing.
   But the restless republics are not impressed. Four of
them, Georgia and the three Baltic states, are flatly
refusing to sign any new treaty because they want to regain
their independence. Delegates from Moldavia walked out of the
congress on Tuesday, and Armenia, Russia, the Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have all said they won't sign Mr.
Gorbachev's treaty unless it is redrafted.
   The issue of giving the Soviet president greater powers
has now overlapped with wrangling over the union treaty,
casting doubt on Mr. Gorbachev's ability to create any
functioning power base.
   Mr. Yeltsin, who only four months ago appeared ready to
cooperate with Mr. Gorbachev, denounced the planned new
executive powers, saying they would give the president more
unchecked legal rights than such discredited former leaders
as Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.
   An opponent of Mr. Yeltsin, Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, in what could be a farewell speech, lashed out at
unidentified "political forces" he claimed were trying to
destroy the Soviet economy. He said many groups were using
the cover of market economics to wage "a real political
struggle."
   At the same time, he acknowledged the failure of his
government to halt the Soviet economy's rapid decline. "We
have not managed to implement perestroika in the form that it
was originally conceived," he said, referring to Mr.
Gorbachev's economic restructuring program. Excusing the
Soviet president's "tactical errors," he added that he
himself was partly to blame because he allowed ideology to
take priority over economics.
