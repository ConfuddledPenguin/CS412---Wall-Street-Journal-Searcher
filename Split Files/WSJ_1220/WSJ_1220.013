   The author-neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks has translated his
treatment and study of neurological disorders into exquisite
tales of medical mystery and spiritual probing. In his books
"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" and "Awakenings,"
Dr. Sacks introduced the lay reader to bizarre cases and the
larger moral meaning that could be drawn from individual
afflictions and how they were dealt with by patients, their
families and doctors.
   "Awakenings," based on a true story, is about a group of
people who were beset by encephalitis and then fell into a
living sleep. After spending decades in this condition, one
group of these Rip van Winkles was brought back to this world
in 1969 by a doctor who found out that they could be
awakened. Their re-emergence, facilitated by drugs, was a
miracle -- a miracle that lasted only briefly.

   The director Penny Marshall has gone straight to the heart
of this complex story and made a powerfully poignant and
illuminating film. She doesn't hesitate to push for the grand
sentimental moment, but balances the teary stuff with
restraint and humor. To be sure, "Awakenings" seems
calculated to induce weeping -- and it does, without making
the weeper feel cheap.
   Robin Williams, in the part of Dr. Malcolm Sayer the
neurologist, has become so accomplished and familiar an actor
that it's no longer shocking to see him outside his manic
stand-up-comic persona. The movie's neurologist has been cast
as an absent-minded introvert, a man who's just come off a
five-year stint observing the behavior of earthworms. He
leaves his car keys dangling in the outside lock all day and
uses his refrigerator to store plants.
   Mr. Williams plays this fuzzy little man nerdy to the last
detail, down to his white socks. He walks with his shoulders
hunched awkwardly, like a 12-year-old who thinks he'll become
invisible if he wills himself to be. He is almost invisible;
you can barely see his eyes peering out of the confluence of
beard, glasses and hair. Yet there's always something twinkly
about Mr. Williams, even submerged like this. It's readily
apparent that this quiet, brainy guy just might spot a
miracle because he's oblivious to everything else.
   He's gone to Bainbridge Hospital in the Bronx, which
caters to chronically ill neurological patients, to work in
the lab. At his job interview it becomes apparent to him that
the job that's available isn't, as he thought, a research
job. As it dawns on Dr. Sayer that he's being offered a staff
position, he seems panicky, in his quiet way. "People?" he
says.
   The hospital is desperate; he is hired. An orderly leads
him to the ward referred to as "The Garden"; its inhabitants
are fed and watered. Instead of settling in comfortably to
these surroundings, where patients resemble research
specimens not humans, Dr. Sayer determines to find flickers
of life. He does, and this leads him to look for other
flickers, and to find the connections between the patients
who show signs of vitality behind their blank eyes.
   His research leads him to a doctor who first analyzed the
"children who fell asleep" back in the 1920s, during an
outbreak of encephalitis. Max von Sydow plays the elderly
doctor who shows the younger man films of the patients he'd
observed years before. In one of the movie's simple,
clarifying moments, the older doctor tells the younger man
these patients don't know they've been "asleep" for 40 years
or more. When pressed, the old man gives his reasoning: "The
alternative is unthinkable."
   Ms. Marshall and her screenwriter, Steven Zaillian,
incorporate into their story many familiar movie tactics that
serve the purpose of moving things along without tarnishing
the story's delicate magic. So, as Dr. Sayer begins to test
the reflexes he's sure he sees in his patients, he rouses the
previously indifferent nurses and orderlies to his cause.
And, because every movie hero needs an antagonist, John Heard
is called upon to play the doubting head doctor, Dr. Kaufman,
whose main job is to give Sayer a challenge. Ms. Marshall
even manages to pull off the rather unnecessary parallel
story that requires Dr. Sayer to learn a lesson from his
patients. To further this line, the film makers have arranged
a wistful flirtation between nurse (Julie Kavner) and Sayer,
her boss. He's oblivious, of course, until he watches his
patients return to life and realizes that they're not the
only ones who have been sleeping. Though this adherence to
Hollywood code that romance must be injected everywhere isn't
worthy of the film's general spirit, it doesn't diminish the
picture's emotional strength.
   Meanwhile, in the medical plot line Dr. Sayer learns about
a drug he thinks will work on his patients, and convinces his
superior, Dr. Kaufman, to finance an experiment on just one
patient. Robert De Niro plays the patient, a 50-year-old man
named Leonard. Mr. De Niro was an ideal choice for this role,
the adult whose personality stopped developing when he fell
asleep as a smart, polite adolescent. The actor has an
uncanny ability to appear sweetly free of experience, and
then to disintegrate into a confusion of tics and spasms as
side effects take hold.
   This film isn't a repeat of the marvelous trick Ms.
Marshall pulled off before in "Big," where Tom Hanks played a
12-year-old inhabiting a 35-year-old man's body. Leonard
didn't -- poof] -- make an instant leap in age. He's been a
child, year in and year out, for a very long time, tended by
his elegant and eloquent mother. When he realizes what his
life has been, his joy is severely mitigated by what he's
lost -- and Mr. De Niro makes his loss vividly, sorrowfully
apparent.
   As Leonard's mother, Ruth Nelson achieves a clear,
wrenching beauty that stands out even among these exceptional
actors doing exceptional things.

   VIDEO TIP: To appreciate how much Ms. Marshall has
accomplished here, it's worthwhile to look at her two
previous films. When it was released there seemed little to
note in "Jumpin' Jack Flash," the director's first film, a
comedy that seemed to indicate Ms. Marshall should stick to
acting. Then she surprised everyone with the charming "Big,"
whose success at the box office made Ms. Marshall a serious
player in the industry.
