   NEW YORK (AP) -- The departing head of the New York Stock
Exchange said he expects Wall Street's recession to last
another six to 18 months.
   But John J. Phelan Jr., who steps down Dec. 31 after six
years as Big Board chairman, called the three-year industry
slump just another business cycle and predicted the markets
would be "roaring" again by the mid-1990s.

   "We've got problems to get over," the 59-year-old Mr.
Phelan said in an interview. "We had excesses in the '80s.
The entire country overleveraged itself, from each individual
right up through the majority of corporations. It's going to
take us awhile to digest that.
   "But I think we will do that . . . without a major
catastrophe," he said. "I think by the middle of this decade
you're going to have a roaring market again. We'll all be
worried about capacity and volume again."
