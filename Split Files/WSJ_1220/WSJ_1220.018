   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- William L. Webster argued the
"right to life" after receiving a death threat himself.
   In April 1989, as anti-abortion and abortion-rights
demonstrators jostled and clamored outside the U.S. Supreme
Court, the Missouri Attorney General presented an oral
argument against the performance of abortions in public
hospitals and clinics. Extra security surrounded him that
day, and he arrived at the court through a secondary
entrance. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court eventually
upheld his position; Mr. Webster hailed "a great victory."

   Now the question is whether that great victory will help
translate into a great springboard -- into the governor's
office in 1992.
   Although he hasn't formally declared, there's little doubt
that the fresh-faced and controversial Mr. Webster is
running. He has a $1.3 million war chest, he has a campaign
organization, and he leads two GOP nomination rivals in a
recent Missouri net poll. In the broadest sense, the coming
race will be a referendum on the views -- and the consistency
-- of a man who has become identified with the most explosive
issues of contemporary politics: The right to live and the
right to die.
   "There are people who say Bill Webster is trying to play
God," he says in his conference room here. "But the question
isn't whether I am trying to play God. It's whether I will
enforce the laws of the state." Serving during what he calls
an extraordinary "confluence of law and public policy,"
Attorney General Webster and his office have represented
Missouri in three life-and-death U.S. Supreme Court cases
within the past two years.
   The 1989 abortion case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, eroded the landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling of 1973,
which recognized a woman's constitutional right to an
abortion. In a second ruling last year the court, again
upholding Missouri, ruled that the execution of a 16-year-old
murderer would not be cruel and unusual punishment.
   Early this year, the high court sided with Missouri for a
third time. It ruled that a Missouri hospital could not end
the feeding and hydration of Nancy Cruzan, who has been in
what some doctors term a "persistent vegetative state" since
a 1983 auto accident. The ruling was a blow to Miss Cruzan's
parents, who felt their daughter would not have wanted to
live this way, and to the national "right to die" movement
generally.
   The abortion and Cruzan cases made Mr. Webster a hero to
the anti-abortion movement and a target for abortion-rights
activists. After the abortion decision, abortion-righters
staged a huge rally in front of Mr. Webster's office here,
singing "Bye-bye Billy" and cheering as GOP state Treasurer
Wendell Bailey exhorted them to "de-Websterize Missouri." Mr.
Bailey now seeks the gubernatorial nomination on an
abortion-rights platform; the third GOP hopeful is Secretary
of State Roy Blunt, who takes an anti-abortion stand.
   The object of all this passion is a boyish-looking
37-year-old who, when elected, was the youngest attorney
general in the nation. Generations of Websters have been
active in Missouri politics, and his late father, Richard
Webster, was arguably the most powerful man in the Missouri
Senate. (However, Mr. Webster is no relation to another
William Webster from Missouri, the man who headed the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and now heads the Central
Intelligence Agency.) He is, he agrees, a symbol.
   "I guess to some I am a symbol of a state attempting to
put restrictions on abortion," says Mr. Webster. "I guess I'm
an easy target for the pro-choicers."
   But he's a moving target. There are signs that Bill
Webster the attorney has begun a metamorphosis into Bill
Webster the gubernatorial candidate. The process has
unsettled some of his anti-abortion supporters and
conservatives generally.
   After his office represented Missouri in the Cruzan case
all the way to the Supreme Court, Mr. Webster declared last
September that he saw "no reason for the state's involvement"
in a second attempt by her parents to have her feeding tube
removed. Last week, after listening to supporting testimony
from new witnesses, a Missouri judge granted the parents'
request. Miss Cruzan is now expected to die within the next
two weeks.
   "I'm personally very disturbed by his decision," says Mary
Kay Culp, an official of Missouri Citizens for Life. "I'm not
prepared to say it was a political decision. I hope it
wasn't, because Nancy Cruzan will die a very painful death
and I wonder how he'll feel then."
   Mr. Webster says neither Cruzan decision was political. He
says that his office was drawn into the first case and that
his goal was to establish precedent in an unusual medical and
legal situation. (Among other factors, Miss Cruzan was
considered merely disabled, not terminal; doctors said that,
with continued feeding, she could perhaps live for decades).
Once the Missouri and U.S. supreme courts had established
standards for such cases, Mr. Webster argued, there was
"really no legal basis for Missouri to be in there."
   In another incident that jarred some conservatives, Mr.
Webster was quoted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as saying
during a Missouri AFL-CIO convention that the 1980s were "a
decade when the signal was it's OK to bust unions, bend the
rules, have lax regulatory enforcement." Mr. Webster says he
doesn't "believe that {quotation} is correct" and the story
"missed the context." The Post-Dispatch stands by its story.
   Although the nomination race hasn't even officially
started, indications are it will be a bare-knuckled contest.
As a case in point, critics of Mr. Webster provided The
Journal with a copy of a Jan. 9, 1990, letter written by
Charles H. Cozean Jr., an ophthalmologist who's chairman of a
political-action committee, Missouri EyePac. In the letter,
Dr. Cozean writes of a reception attended by Mark Rhoads, Mr.
Webster's director of administration.
   The letter states that Mr. Rhoads "told me, in effect,
that if ophthalmology would support him for governor, he
would assure us that no new optometric initiatives would come
down the legislative pike."
   Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Rhoads called the letter "a
totally untrue and irresponsible statement from a doctor
hoping to impress his colleagues with the appearance of
political clout." In an interview, Attorney General Webster
said it was "not only wrong but patently ludicrous." He said:
"We would never predetermine the fate of any legislation for
any group, whether they support me or not."
   A day after the interview, Mr. Webster's office faxed The
Journal a second letter written by Dr. Cozean, this one dated
Dec. 11, 1990. In it, Dr. Cozean wrote that his first letter
"overstated" his conversation with Mr. Rhoads. "While Mr.
Rhoads and I discussed a variety of topics, he did not {and
as a practical matter, could not} give any assurances
regarding legislation which might be introduced or ultimately
passed by the General Assembly," the letter stated. "With
regard to the 1992 Missouri governor's race, Mr. Rhoads
indicated that he felt confident that Bill Webster would
welcome support from our professionals."
