   In her important new book, "Narcoterrorism" (Basic Books,
272 pages, $19.95), Rachel Ehrenfeld explores the connections
between drugs and political power in a changing world. She
documents the unholy alliance, prior to the end of the Cold
War, between Soviet-supported Marxist states and drug
traffickers. And she describes the threat posed to the West
by the burgeoning relationship between narco-traffickers and
various terrorist insurgencies.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld, whose background is in criminology, begins
with a discussion of Bulgaria, the most loyal of Soviet
allies. She describes how the Bulgarian intelligence service
created a front company to facilitate the movement of Middle
East heroin to Europe and Asia; profits were sometimes used
to buy weapons for Palestinian and other Middle Eastern
terrorists; sometimes weapons were simply exchanged for
drugs.

   Sandinistas and Colombia's M-19 have also profited nicely
from the drugs flowing through Cuba and into the U.S., writes
Ms. Ehrenfeld, who lifts some of the mystery surrounding the
show trial and execution of several Cuban military officers
on trafficking charges in 1989. She argues that Castro may
have feared his drug operations had been penetrated and were
about to be exposed. By blaming a popular perestroika-leaning
general, Castro simultaneously eliminated a potential threat
to his leadership and prevented an embarrassing
drug-trafficking scandal.
   The information is indeed fascinating and historically
extremely important. However, the author fails to discuss how
changes within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well
as the ending of the Cold War, have influenced Marxist
support of narco-terrorism. It seems likely that recent
events have already damped the Soviets' capacity and desire
to involve themselves in foreign adventures.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld also makes the mistake of giving too much
credit to Castro and other Marxist/Leninists by arguing they
have "nearly totally dominated this particularly dirty
business." But those dominating the drug-trafficking business
are more interested in profits than politics.
   Still, there is no question that the relationship between
narcotics trafficking and terrorist insurgencies will
accelerate with fading Soviet support. An increasing number
of groups, from South America to the Middle East to Asia,
have learned methods of financing their activities either
through dealing drugs directly or by inserting themselves
into the drug-trafficking process as middle men or security
operatives.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld raises questions about the traditional U.S.
approach to anti-narcotics policy outside our borders:
illicit crop eradication in drug-producing countries,
coordinated by the U.S. Department of State; and the
indictment, extradition and prosecution of foreign "drug
kingpins" carried out in most cases by the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Crop eradication has been an abject failure; there are
world-wide bumper crops of opium poppy and coca leaf.
Furthermore, the prosecution approach, while recently
providing some valuable extraditions, is inherently limited
because it is directed at individuals who purposely avoid
subjecting themselves to U.S. law-enforcement jurisdiction.
The folks at DEA can paper their walls with indictments of
Pablo Escobar, but it won't do any good unless they catch him
vacationing at Disney World.
   Altogether, Ms. Ehrenfeld raises worrisome questions
concerning national security implications and reinforces the
belief that the U.S. national security agencies must get
actively involved in dismantling drug-trafficking
organizations, overtly and covertly.
   The DEA does an excellent job abroad. Its people are
probably the single most courageous group of U.S. civil
servants, but they should not be forced to shoulder the
entire international anti-drug mission. President Bush has
energized most federal agencies to tackle the drug problem,
but the U.S. national security community has only recently
geared up for its new mission. The Defense Department and
Central Intelligence Agency have mounted impressive efforts
to collect information on narcoterrorism. Yet it is not at
all clear how all this information will be used to actually
attack the problem.
   For example, when told of my proposal to shoot down
aircraft outside our borders (only in situations where we are
certain they are smuggling drugs), a National Security
Council staffer responded that it would be ill-advised to use
force "on a suspect before he'd been indicted." From this one
might conclude that the national security community views
Pablo Escobar in the same way it views Colonel Gadhafi, whom
we are perfectly willing to attack without an indictment.
   Moreover, the circus atmosphere surrounding the
prosecution of Gen. Manuel Noriega, even prior to the
beginning of the trial, further demonstrates the weaknesses
of treating international narco-terrorism as a traditional
law-enforcement problem.
   "Narcoterrorism" lays out an important strategic challenge
for the U.S. in the 1990s. A number of agencies within our
government need to work to disable growing narco-terrorism
movements before they start destabilizing entire regions of
the world. This is one part of the drug war we had better
win, and we can only win it if we begin to fight.
