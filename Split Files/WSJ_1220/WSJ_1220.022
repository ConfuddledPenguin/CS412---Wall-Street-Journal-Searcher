   NEW YORK -- Stone &amp; Webster Inc. said it is cutting its
quarterly dividend in half to 15 cents a share because it is
retaining workers in anticipation of increasing demand.
   The dividend is payable Feb. 15, 1991, to stockholders of
record Jan. 2, 1991.

   The provider of engineering, construction and consulting
services said while it expects a growing demand from
electrical power utilities in the 1990s, it will not realize
the benefits until after this year. It also said that it has
begun a number of new projects that require large cash
expenditures for payroll and start-up costs.
   Separately, the company said its engineering unit was
awarded a contract from oil company Saudi Aramco and its U.S.
affiliate to support its pipeline management program. Terms
of the agreement weren't disclosed.
   Stone &amp; Webster said it will provide engineering,
construction and project management services as well as
materials procurement support. The services will be provided
over a number of years in both the U.S. and in Saudi Arabia.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stone
&amp; Webster shares closed unchanged at $31.125.
