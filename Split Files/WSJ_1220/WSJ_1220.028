   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission showed its
mettle by imposing its biggest fine to date on a single
company for alleged breach of EC competition law.
   The Belgian chemical company Solvay &amp; Cie. was fined 30
million European currency units ($41.4 million), Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC of Britain was fined 17 million ECUs
and a unit of BASF AG of Germany was fined 1 million ECUs.
The case involved alleged market-sharing and illegal pricing
arrangements for soda ash, a chemical used mainly in the
glass-making industry.

   Solvay and ICI said the commission's decision is
groundless and the two companies plan to appeal to the
European Court of Justice. Solvay said the fines are "totally
unjustified," while ICI said it was "shocked" by the
decision. The BASF unit, Chemische Fabrik Kalk G.m.b.H.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   The commission said its action would help open up the EC's
soda-ash market to "genuine competition," particularly by
U.S. producers.
