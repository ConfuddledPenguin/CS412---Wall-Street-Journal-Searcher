   In its own methodical way, United Parcel Service of
America Inc. is muscling deeper into the $9 billion-plus
domestic air-express business.
   That business was largely created -- and is still
dominated -- by Federal Express Corp. But in recent months,
UPS -- the Greenwich, Conn., ground-shipping giant -- has
been:

   -- Hammering away at Federal's service edge. Armed with
more than $1.5 billion in improvements to its system of
tracking and scheduling deliveries, as well as a more
flexible Teamsters contract, UPS now guarantees 10:30 a.m.
next-day delivery in more locations than Federal. It also is
expanding its ability to pick up packages for delivery within
an hour, and is talking about matching Federal's Saturday
delivery option.
   -- Offering bigger discounts to large-volume customers.
UPS started experimenting with limited discounts two years
ago. Now the company's salespeople are bidding on more
contracts and telling shipping managers that UPS is willing
to haggle on price as other carriers have done for years.
   -- Reorganizing and enlarging its sales force. The company
is trying to hire sales specialists from other carriers and
has realigned its national sales staff to focus on specific
industries, including health care and electronics.
   UPS, with 237,000 employees and $12.4 billion in revenue,
has hit several roadblocks -- some the result of its own
inertia. Some shippers say UPS's discounts, reportedly in the
10% to 20% range, aren't substantial enough; others complain
that its sales staff still hasn't learned to compete with
Federal. Some analysts, meanwhile, say UPS is trying to play
catch-up in an industry battered by too many players, too
many fax machines and a looming recession.
   Competitors, however, are wary.
   "When a company of the size and resources of UPS decides
it wants to be involved in a particular niche of ours or
Federal Express's, I think it's cause for concern," says Kent
W. Freudenberger, executive vice president for marketing and
sales at Airborne Freight Corp., a Seattle-based competitor
that operates as Airborne Express. "The worst thing we could
do is underestimate UPS."
   How much UPS already has gained in the air is difficult to
measure, because package volume is reported and calculated in
different ways. Federal, for instance, claims (and some
analysts agree) that its own share of the next-day market has
held steady at about 45% for the past two years. It
acknowledges that UPS has grown -- but at the expense of
other competitors. Closely held UPS declines to estimate
market share.
   But Air Cargo Management Group, a Seattle consulting firm,
says UPS's share of first- and second-day air has grown by 10
percentage points since 1988 while Federal's may have dropped
as many as 14. Moreover, UPS's decision earlier this month to
raise retail air-shipment rates an average of 9.9% could give
it the freedom to offer better prices to frequent customers
and thus gain market share.
   Some companies are changing their loyalties. Before this
year, Square D Co., an electrical-equipment manufacturer
based in Palatine, Ill., gave little of its $7 million to $9
million in annual air shipping to UPS, says Charles A.
Gerardi, manager of transportation. Now, however, UPS gets
25% of the business because it's giving Square D a break on
price. (Mr. Gerardi wouldn't say how much.)
   "Before, {UPS} said, `This is the lowest geographically
published rate there is,'" recalls Mr. Gerardi, who says he
reminded the company that its competitors were offering
discounts. UPS replied, "Well, we don't do that," Mr. Gerardi
adds. But, "They're doing that now."
   The company, however, still has a lot to learn about
wooing volume customers, according to some shipping managers.
That includes the art of staying in touch.
   "Federal Express was on the phone every day or every other
day, saying, `Hey, how's it coming? Have you made any
decisions yet? Is there anything else you need?'" says a
shipper for a large New Jersey pharmaceutical company that
was considering signing a contract with an air-express
company. "With UPS, the bid was sent out, and it came back,
and there was nothing else."
   "Nobody would ever accuse them of being pushy
salespeople," says Philip M. Binkow, president of Payment
Technologies, an Atlanta firm that helps companies reduce
their express-mail costs. Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an Emory
University professor who has studied UPS in depth, thinks
that's because the company's culture has long encouraged
humility and modesty.
   UPS is also making its moves from a position of some
weakness. Increased competition on the ground from Roadway
Express Inc., an Akron, Ohio, unit of Roadway Services Inc.,
as well as the cost of expansion overseas, have helped reduce
UPS's profit margin to 8.4% through the first nine months of
1990, down from 9.5% a year earlier. Still, the company's
$847.9 million of long-term debt represents a relatively
comfortable 10.3% of assets. That compares with more than $2
billion of debt at Federal, representing almost 36% of
assets.
   Indeed, UPS's efforts come at a particularly bad time for
its biggest rival. Federal, based in Memphis, Tenn., has seen
growth in domestic volume slow to 9%, compared with 16% to
20% earlier in the year. Last month, to win a $50
million-plus contract to provide next-day service to the
federal government, Federal Express bid $3.75 a light package
-- a rock-bottom price that surprised government officials
and astonished some competitors and customers.
   Federal insists the low price reflects favorable geography
(most of the government's shipments come from Washington,
D.C., and Los Angeles, where Federal Express has extra
capacity) and not market pressures. Still, a combination of
concerns about pricing pressures, slower volume growth and
competition from UPS have prompted some analysts to cut their
earnings estimates for Federal. (Current estimates for fiscal
second-quarter figures, scheduled to be released today, range
from 55 cents to 65 cents a share, off from 70 cents last
year.)
   Paul R. Schlesinger, a Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
analyst who slashed his earnings estimate last month for
Federal, expects customers to push for bigger discounts. If
that happens, UPS has the advantages of a small debt load and
a formidable ground-delivery service: Its drivers already
drop in daily at 1.1 million accounts.
   Mr. Schlesinger said it was largely UPS that kept Federal
from instituting a fuel surcharge this fall. "Federal Express
-- they wouldn't like to hear it put this way -- but they
take their pricing marching orders from Greenwich."
   Not surprisingly, Federal executives disagree. The company
says it has no plans to match UPS's price increase, for
instance, which takes effect in February. "We set the pricing
in the market," says William J. Razzouk, Federal's senior
vice president of sales and customer information. "When
somebody else gets to be the market leader -- and we have no
intention of letting that happen -- then someone can say
we're taking our pricing orders from them."
