   ("CBS study shows the advantage of marketing to older
viewers." -- WSJ news item)
                                                                                                       

   It's me the network's paging,
   I'm their viewing angel, aging.
   It's on me that they're depending
   For watching and then spending.
   With my age group now they traffic,
   I'm their favorite demographic.

   When a speaker is
   Almost inaudible
   I don't find it
   Applaudable.
   If he raises his pitch
   To the nth decibel
   I'm not apt to be Accessible.
   I eschew the stentorian
   And sidestep the faint,
   Just give me clarity
   With restraint.

   Crooked politician: public defunder.
