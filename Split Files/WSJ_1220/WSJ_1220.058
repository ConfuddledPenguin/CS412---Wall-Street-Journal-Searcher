   WASHINGTON -- Savings and loans under government
management posted losses of $2.3 billion for the third
quarter, said the Resolution Trust Corp. That was a slight
expansion from the previous quarter.
   Losses for the 206 thrifts awaiting sale or liquidation by
the government included $1.5 billion in write-downs on assets
and losses on the sale of assets. Losses on assets are
expected to represent the biggest slice of the $200 billion
cost of the thrift-industry cleanup.

   The 206 reporting thrifts held $90.7 billion in assets,
which have shrunk 27% since the thrifts were seized by the
government, the agency said.
   Meanwhile, the longer the thrifts remain in government
hands, the higher their operating costs, incurred by
taxpayers, pile up. Third-quarter results include $863
million in operating losses, which stop accruing when the
government disposes of those thrifts.
   The losses of 247 government-controlled thrifts in the
second quarter were restated yesterday to $2 billion,
according to the agency. S&amp;Ls that aren't under government
management recently reported losses of $631.4 million for the
third quarter.
   Losses from government-controlled thrifts aren't likely to
abate soon. About 218 S&amp;Ls are considered to be immediate
candidates for government takeover. Several hundred more S&amp;Ls
could fail, if the economic slowdown is protracted,
regulators say.
