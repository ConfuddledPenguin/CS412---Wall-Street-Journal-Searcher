   New York regulators granted Nynex Corp.'s New York
Telephone unit a $250 million rate increase, far less than
the company's $831.7 million request but well above most
recommendations.
   Investors who thought they soon would see higher earnings,
however, received a surprise. The commission offset the
revenue gains by increasing depreciation charges. While most
companies would be happy to write off their equipment faster,
New York Telephone complained that the commission "did not go
far enough in recognizing our need to improve earnings in
1991."

   "Those looking for a windfall in earnings are going to be
disappointed," said Jack Grubman, analyst with PaineWebber
Inc. "But those who look for cash flow and firm value will be
happy."
   New York Telephone had sought depreciation charges of
nearly $190 million in connection with upgrading its network.
The six-member Public Service Commission yesterday voted
unanimously for the $250 million increase but boosted
depreciation charges by $72 million.
   "Investors expected a rate increase of $250 {million} to
$300 million, with $60 million or more in additional
operating income," said Robert Morris, analyst with Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. "They don't get that now."
   Nynex shares, which had been climbing all week, fell 87.5
cents to close in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at $73.375 yesterday. They had traded as high as $75.50
during the day.
   "We didn't want additional funds to be going to earnings,"
said Commissioner Gail Garfield Schwartz. "We believe a 12.2%
return on equity is reasonable and justified."
   New York Telephone said it was disappointed by the
decision, which it said could hurt plans to upgrade its
network. The commission, it said, "did not go far enough in
recognizing our need to improve earnings in 1991." The
company, which agreed to a rate moratorium in 1985 and
extended it in 1987, said it had cut rates by $467 million,
and that the new rates "will still be significantly below
those that were in effect five years ago."
   The commission reserved judgment on any extra charges New
York Telephone customers may have paid in connection with
transactions among Nynex affiliates as well as transactions
between the company's former purchasing unit and suppliers
who attended annual parties in Florida. The PSC has been
investigating transactions involving the phone company and
other Nynex units that stemmed from disclosures of
overcharges by its purchasing unit to New York Telephone
affiliates as well as the annual Florida parties, nicknamed
the "Perverts Conventions."
   The rate increase goes into effect Jan. 1, but the
commission must further consider how the increase will be
apportioned among New York Telephone's various categories of
service. Robert Anderson, the phone company's managing
director for regulatory planning, said the decision
apparently will result in an overall 4.8% rate increase, with
a 7% boost for residential customers and 2% for businesses.
The exact increases, however, won't be known until tomorrow
when the commission issues its formal report.
   In voting for a $250 million increase, the commission
rejected the recommendation of three administrative law
judges, who two months ago urged the commission to allow only
a $23.6 million boost. Data submitted by the company during
the contentious rate case didn't support a big increase, they
argued. The commission also rebuffed the state Consumer
Protection Board, which recommended rolling back rates.
   Richard Kessel, head of the consumer agency, said he was
"terribly disappointed by the decision because the company
isn't entitled to any rate increase whatsoever." Mr. Kessel
said the agency plans to challenge the decision.
   Nevertheless, the decision does give New York Telephone an
added incentive to pare costs and operate more efficiently.
The commission earmarked $35 million to improve wiring in
neighborhoods and other phone equipment outside of phone
company switching centers. As for the company's complaint
that network modernization will be stifled, Commissioner
Schwartz said that New York Telephone "didn't have anything
in the revenue request that would have gone toward building
an intelligent network."
