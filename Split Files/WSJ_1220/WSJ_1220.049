   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- In an apparent attempt to
calm any fears over the continued existence of N.V. Philips,
the president of the Dutch electronics giant said a break-up
of the company would be "the very last resort."
   In an interview published in a company newsletter, the
executive, Jan D. Timmer, said: "We are assuming that if
everybody does their bit, improvements can be made throughout
Philips that will allow us to maintain the company in its
current form. Splitting the company up is the very last
resort, a step that neither I nor Philips are ready to take."

   It was the first time Mr. Timmer had publicly mentioned
the possibility of a breakup of Philips if his restructuring
plan fails.
   Tom Gietman, an analyst with Van Meer-James Capel,
speculated that the statement was intended as a warning to
Philips's Dutch unions not to present obstacles to the
restructuring drive.
   Last summer, Mr. Timmer decreed an extraordinary
cost-cutting effort aimed at trimming corporate fat and
reversing losses. Part of the cutback involves eliminating
55,000 jobs in Philips's world-wide operations. The company
makes a wide range of consumer electronic items from light
bulbs to televisions.
