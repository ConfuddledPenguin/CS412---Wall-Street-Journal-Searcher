   MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp., in its largest
outside venture to date, said it agreed to invest $230
million in a new company it will form with the computer
division of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG.
   The venture is expected to give Digital a sorely needed
boost as it struggles to cut costs and reverse sagging sales.
"Overnight, this gives Digital a considerably larger presence
in Germany, which is the largest European market, and a
springboard into the growing Eastern European markets," said
Philippe de Marcillac, a Paris-based analyst with Dataquest
Corp. "It appears to be one of the first cases of an American
acquisition of a European computer company," he said.

   Digital said it will own 65% of the new company, which
will consist of the German concern's Mannesmann Kienzle
Computer Systems Division and the division's Procad G.m.b.H.
and PCS G.m.b.H. units. Mannesmann, which makes automotive
parts, steel tubing, electric motors and other products, will
own 35% of the new company. Digital will have an option to
purchase Mannesmann's stake "over time," but has no immediate
plans to do so, said Digital executives. The new company,
called Digital-Kienzle Computer Systeme G.m.b.H., will be
based in Villingen, Germany.
   The venture represents a break with Digital's tradition of
making relatively small investments in outside companies.
Employing about 3,900 people, Mannesmann Kienzle is Germany's
second-largest domestic computer supplier. It will have 1990
revenue of about $539 million; its revenue is expected to
rise next year, Digital said. For the fiscal year ended June
30, Digital earned $74.4 million, or 59 cents a share, after
a pretax restructuring charge of $550 million. Its sales were
$12.94 billion.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Digital closed at $58, down $1.25.
   Mannesmann Kienzle's computer systems are targeted at
small and medium-sized companies -- the kinds of computer
customers expected in Eastern Europe, said Pier Carlo
Falotti, head of Digital's European operations. The German
concern is tailoring its software to run with a version of
the Unix operating system, enabling the software to be
combined with Digital's slightly different Unix-based systems
without major changes, Digital executives added.
   Digital said its current German unit, based in Munich,
caters mainly to large customers; it will continue to operate
independently of the new venture.
   Mannesmann Kienzle's marketing arm "will complement our
channels of distribution," said John F. Smith, Digital's
senior vice president for operations. "We will sell our
products through their channels" and vice versa, he said. Mr.
Smith added that the new venture also will have "synergy"
with the Mannesmann group of companies, which have annual
sales of about $15 billion and a growing need for computers.
