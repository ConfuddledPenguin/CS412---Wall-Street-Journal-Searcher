   TOKYO -- Export orders for Japanese shipbuilders in
November tumbled 82% from a year earlier, as orders for only
four vessels brought combined tonnage to 145,900 metric tons,
compared with 803,250 tons in November 1989, the Japan Ship
Exporters' Association said. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.
   Association officials said the latest statistics reflect a
wait-and-see attitude by ship owners and shipbuilders,
resulting from uncertainty about the pace of world economic
growth and concern about growing labor and materials costs in
Japan. They said the yen's appreciation in value against the
dollar this year has hurt competitiveness of Japanese
exporters.

   November's tally compares with a 51% year-to-year plunge
in ship export contracts in October, when Japanese
shipbuilders committed to build 12 vessels with combined
gross tonnage of 369,340 metric tons.
