   CHANCELLOR LAMONT STANDS FIRM

   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont said
the nation's deepening recession wouldn't move him to adjust
current exchange-rate and monetary policies.
   "We will do whatever is necessary to maintain sterling's
position in the exchange-rate mechanism," he declared in his
first press conference since assuming his post last month. In
holding firm to the arrangement, which sets a median
exchange-rate of 2.95 marks for the pound, Mr. Lamont dashed
hopes for a Yuletide cut in interest rates or a realignment
within the European Monetary System.
   Meanwhile, government figures released separately showed
that the British economy contracted by 1.2% between the
second and third quarters this year. Amid such signs that the
U.K. recession is proving to be harsher than anticipated,
industry officials have stepped up a campaign for a cut in
base rates, which stand at 14%.
   The Confederation of British Industries' latest survey
reported that the manufacturing sector expects the biggest
falloff in production in 10 years.
                                                                                                       

   THE EC LOOKS EAST
                                                                                                       

   The European Community will begin today to negotiate
accords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary that could
eventually lead to membership in the 12-nation bloc. The EC
said the accords would set up free trade in manufactured
goods and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation.
Provisions for financial assistance from the community may be
included in the accords, the EC said.
                                                                                                       

   SAS PLANE FOR VIETNAM AIRLINES?

   Scandinavian Airline System plans to lease one of its
Boeing 767 jets to Vietnam Airlines. However, Kjell Fredheim,
head of SAS Airline, said, "A prerequisite for the signing is
the approval of the U.S. government." He added: "We will not
enter an agreement that violates American regulations." If
the deal goes through, the aircraft will operate between
Thailand and Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   REFORESTING THE AMAZON
                                                                                                       

   Brazil has approved the first major plan to reforest part
of the Amazon, at a cost of $3 billion, officials said. The
plan, to be funded by private industry and foreign
contributions, envisages the reforestation of 2.5 million
acres over 10 years. The state mining concern Companhia Vale
do Rio Doce, which helped draft the project, said that the
project should begin within a year.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S TRADE POSITION
                                                                                                       

   South Korea told the U.S. it would review its position on
global trade in an effort to contribute to the success of
stalled trade talks. Seoul officials said the U.S. complained
that South Korea had sided with the European Community and
Japan on the thorny farm-subsidy issue in the Uruguay Round
negotiations that broke down in Brussels earlier this month.
South Korea also promised efforts to prevent the country's
controversial frugality campaign from discriminating against
imported goods.
                                                                                                       

   `FORGOTTEN EMERGENCY'
                                                                                                       

   A 10-month civil war has made Liberia the world's biggest
human tragedy at present, but there has been no response to a
United Nations appeal for aid, a U.N. relief official said.
   "It's a forgotten emergency," said Frank Verhaegen, senior
relief coordinator with the U.N. Disaster Relief
Organization. "Government structures are non-existent,
hospitals are not functioning, no one has been vaccinated
since the beginning of the year and agriculture is at a
standstill."
   Mr. Verhaegen said an aid appeal launched by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Dec. 5 had gone
unheeded. "The response from the international community has
been zero," he said. "There has been an embarrassing silence
. . . at a time when everyone is rushing to the rescue of the
Soviet Union."
   Mr. Verhaegen said some countries, including the U.S.,
were probably waiting for a political settlement before
offering aid. "In the meantime," he said, "the lives of
thousands of Liberians, some threatened by famine-related
diseases, are at risk."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   In Australia, the top of the Sydney Opera House sported a
huge pair of sunglasses yesterday, put there by the
environmental group Greenpeace. The inflatable sunglasses --
70 feet wide by 20 feet high -- were accompanied by a banner
that read: "Ozone Depletion: stop it or we'll go blind." A
portable generator inflated the glasses at about 6:30 a.m.,
and they stayed in place for about an hour until police
pulled the plug. . . . Four out of 10 Britons are bored with
eating turkey at Christmas, according to a new poll. The
survey, by Market &amp; Opinion Research International, showed
salmon and duck as top choices for alternative Yuletide fare.
