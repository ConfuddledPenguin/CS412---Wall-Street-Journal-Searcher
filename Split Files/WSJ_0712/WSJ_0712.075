   A tiny Silicon Valley start-up will get a jump on the
Japanese today when it unveils what is believed to be the
world's first factory dedicated to making superconducting
chips.
   The three-year-old company, Conductus Inc., has quietly
turned out experimental chips at its factory since March for
companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co., which bought a stake
in the closely held company in 1988.

   Conductus's factory flies in the face of warnings that
government-backed Japanese conglomerates, which have poured
hundreds of millions of dollars into superconductor research
since 1987, are winning the race to move the material from
the laboratory to the marketplace. The company said it
already has orders for prototype chips from seven U.S.
companies.
   Conductus "is moving very quickly from superconductors as
a material-science curiosity into developing them into
prototype devices," said Rod K. Quinn, director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory's exploratory research and development
center, who warned of a Japanese superconductivity juggernaut
after a visit to Japan last year. Conductus "is becoming a
flag carrier" for the U.S. in superconductivity, he said.
   Conductus was formed in September 1987 by venture
capitalists, soon after researchers in Zurich and later in
Texas shook the world with the discovery of superconductors
that work at much higher temperatures than originally thought
possible. The new "high-temperature" materials, which conduct
electricity with almost no resistance at around minus 250
degrees Fahrenheit, have the potential to be more
economically viable than older superconductors, which operate
at about minus 420 degrees, because it costs less to cool
them. They're considered ideal for use in extremely fast
computer chips.
   But the new materials, a type of ceramic, are hard to form
into usable shapes, such as the thin films of material needed
to create microscopic circuits on chips. Conductus tackled
that problem at its 4,000-square-foot factory by using mostly
secondhand semiconductor-making equipment, but "we had to
invent equipment for thin film deposition," said Vice
President Ora Smith. "That's where our secret black magic
lies."
   Mr. Quinn of Los Alamos concurred that Conductus's
technology is "remarkable." He attributed it to Conductus's
success in wooing researchers from around the U.S. Its top
executives are scientists and lab managers originally from
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and
Rockwell International Corp. Its advisory board includes a
blue-ribbon roster of professors from schools such as
Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley.
   Conductus makes chips to customers' specifications using
either low-temperature or high-temperature superconductors.
The company said it will focus on electronic applications
rather than on "power" applications, such as electric cables
and magnetically levitating trains. Conductus said one
customer, for example, is designing Conductus-made chips into
equipment to detect objects in space. Superconducting chips
filter out extraneous signals better than conventional chips
do.
   The company also expects to make chips for super-fast
computers, telecommunications equipment, satellites' "eyes"
that can see stars better, and medical equipment that can
look into the human body more safely than X-rays. The company
said it's discussing with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration using chips in a Saturn mission to look at the
planet's clouds.
   A Hewlett-Packard official said the company has "great
expectations" for work done by Conductus. Forward-looking
research in superconductors is better done by small companies
such as Conductus, he said. "It's a very valuable
relationship for us," he added.
   Investors have plowed $11.5 million so far into Conductus,
which expects to be profitable by 1994. The company's factory
in Sunnyvale, Calif., can only make about 25,000 chips a
year, too few for mass commercialization, but the company
said it may increase its capacity.
   The company hasn't ruled out the Japanese threat. "We
think we're closer to commercialization than the Japanese
are," said Mr. Smith, the Conductus vice president. "But we
know that as soon as we look successful, Japanese companies
will be jumping in very actively."
