   Credit Lyonnais said it reached an agreement in principle
with Spain's Banco de Santander to acquire the Spanish bank's
83% controlling interest in Banco Comercial Espanol.
   Terms of the agreement, which is subject to the approval
of Spanish authorities, weren't disclosed. The two
institutions hope to complete the accord by September, a
spokesman for the French state-owned bank said.

   Banco Comercial Espanol has a network of 111 branches
throughout Spain and had assets of 163.2 billion pesetas
($1.62 billion) at the end of 1989.
   Separately, Banco Hispano Americano, also of Spain, said
it rejected the French bank's offer to acquire 20% of its
shares for 60 billion pesetas. The two banks had been
negotiating the share swap for more than a year.
