   Barnett Banks Inc., still feeling the effects of additions
to its loan-loss reserves, said second-quarter earnings fell
9% to $58.5 million, or 93 cents a share, from $64.3 million,
or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.
   The results were an improvement from the first quarter,
when a $66 million charge for problem loans reduced earnings
75%, to $15.5 million, or 25 cents a share.

   Barnett, along with many major banks in the Southeast, has
increased reserves for problem loans in recent months in the
wake of special examinations by the comptroller of the
currency. In the second quarter, Barnett added $16 million to
its loan-loss reserve, giving the Jacksonville, Fla.-based
banking company a total reserve of $332.3 million. That
compares with $230.7 million a year earlier.
   The company, which has more than $31 billion in assets,
said nonperforming assets totaled $467 million as of June 30,
compared with $456 million at the end of the first quarter
and $324 million a year ago.
   In the first half, net fell 42% to $74 million, or $1.18 a
share, from $126.7 million, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier.
