   Schering AG said it expects to boost its per-share
earnings to 40 deutsche marks ($24.39) or 41 marks this year
from 39 marks in 1989.
   The West Berlin-based pharmaceutical and chemical company
added that the rise could be achieved despite the diluting
impact of a 5% stock dividend and the exercise of stock
options.

   A spokeswoman said, however, Schering hasn't altered its
previous forecast that net income for the year will about
match 1989's 225 million marks. Schering had 5.85 billion
marks in sales last year.
   The discrepancy between the outlook for higher per-share
earnings and flat profit can be explained by the fact that
per-share earnings reported by West German companies aren't
equivalent to profit.
   Instead, they are calculated according to guidelines set
by the German Association of Securities Analysts, which
eliminate extraordinary items and allocations to reserves
from per-share earnings. Profit data reported by West German
concerns can be misleading because the companies usually make
overly generous allocations to nontaxable reserves.
