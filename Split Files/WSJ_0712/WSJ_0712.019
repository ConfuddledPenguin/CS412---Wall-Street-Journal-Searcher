   Dallin H. Oaks, a leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (the Mormons), complains in his May 23
editorial-page article, "When `Freedom' Becomes Religious
Censorship," that current law is hostile toward religion in
that it prohibits all prayer in public schools. And he is
right that government oversteps the separation between church
and state when it rewrites prayers. However, in attempting to
instill Christianity in what should be a nonsectarian
ceremony, namely graduation, Mr. Oaks fails to see our entire
system at work.
   First, because governments pay the operating expenses of
public schools, they inherently sponsor and endorse any
prayer in a public school. Therefore, any discussion over the
language to be used in a school is irrelevant. No prayer
should exist. And though public schools should acknowledge
religious beliefs, teaching and honoring them differ
absolutely with teaching about them.

   Second, if all the people at a public-school graduation,
or for that matter in a classroom, wish to pray and are
religiously identical, nothing prevents them from engaging in
a prayer with the language of their denomination. And
government does nothing and can do nothing to prevent this
type of prayer, for no one would complain. Nonetheless, such
prayer should not exist in public schools. Public schools,
after all, serve to educate, not to further embed religious
beliefs.
   If Mr. Oaks does not like the system, I recommend he send
his children to a private school. I'm sure he'll have no
problem finding one willing to make his religious beliefs the
implicit assumptions of his children and eliminate any
thinking that would show his beliefs faulty. Because of this
nation's "religious plurality," however, its tax money must
go toward instilling objectiveness and free thought.

   Mr. Oaks wrote of a case last year where a Utah school
district resolved not to have prayers at high-school
graduations rather than agreeing to use "nondenominational"
prayers. He implied that the school board's decision was
honorable because it did not want to write or censor prayers.
I served as counsel for the students in that suit.
   Mr. Oaks mischaracterizes the response of that school
district. The suit was brought because every year for many
years every invocation and every benediction at the school's
graduations were exclusively prayers for and by members of
the Mormon Church. The suit sought to acknowledge the
diversity of religions.
   Rather than the noble response alleged by Mr. Oaks, the
district's response in reality was, "If we cannot have Mormon
prayers as we always have had, we will have no prayers."
   The issue in Utah is religious intolerance defended under
the guise of preventing censorship. Any attempt to remove
religion from schools in Utah is largely in response to
religious intolerance by a majority and not some sinister
plot by a minority.
   Mr. Oaks suggests that public prayers "honor the religious
plurality of our nation." That plurality is dishonored by the
religious monopoly and intolerance that led to the suit last
year.

   Prayers at public high-school graduations are nothing more
than government forcing religion down the throats of the
people. That's religious tyranny. The Founding Fathers were
not Christians, they were deists. They realized the horrors
and harm caused by religion. That's why they erected a wall
separating church and state, and to protect the people, free
from religion. Today they would be believers in the Big Bang
theory, and acknowledge that the make-believe god and bible
are merely a collection of myths and legends borrowed from
earlier superstitious cultures. Today, enlightened people
everywhere understand these superstitions were inventions of
the primitive mind to explain the unknown.

   I fully agree with Mr. Oaks's concluding remarks in his
article that religion should have a place in the public life
of our nation. But one must not confuse religion with deity.
Any prayer to a deity is a sectarian or denominational act.
It may be as unacceptable to a devoutly religious person as
the setting up of a golden calf for worship is to a devout
Jew.
   It is to be remembered that Siddhartha Gautama (the
Buddha, to those who choose to follow his way) did not advise
the worship of any deity, nor did he set himself up as one.
His last words to his followers were to "look to the light
within you."
   If I choose to go to a Catholic picnic or to a Jewish
feast I had better tolerate their form of religion during my
time there. But I find it quite unacceptable for the public
authorities to require that I kowtow to a deity in the course
of my ordinary activities as an American.
   If a school district is an Islamic or Mormon school
district, it should by all means prescribe or censor prayers
offered at official functions within the district, in keeping
with its doctrine and traditions.
   The lack of religion unquestionably (in my opinion) leads
to ruin, but at the same time no public organization in the
U.S. has any business requiring anyone to recognize any deity
in the course of one's normal activities.

   My education was the public schools of Detroit, and my
undergraduate degree was earned at the University of
Michigan. The time frame was 1940 through 1956.
   In none of those institutions was there any such thing as
prayer or devotional Bible reading in the classrooms or
anywhere else, and I would have been shocked if there was. In
fact, I never even heard of such a thing until after I had
graduated, moved to California and had a landlord who was
trying to get daily Bible readings incorporated into the
public-school routine. I was aghast at the suggestion, since
it impressed me as being improper on its face. The Supreme
Court reached the same obvious conclusion in 1962.
   The lack of religious observances in those classrooms did
not imply hostility toward religion. On the contrary, one of
the most interesting and culturally broadening courses I ever
had was one in which we studied the world's religions.
   I believe that those who went to school with me are no
less religious than the general population. I am active in my
synagogue, and the friends whom I know from that era are
active in their churches.
   The constant complaining that has followed the 1962
Supreme Court decision lacks scholastic rigor and contributes
nothing whatsoever to this country's domestic peace and
tranquility.
