   DeSoto Inc., which has been stalling a persistent hostile
suitor, New York investor group Sutton Holding Corp., said it
plans to sell off operations accounting for more than 80% of
its sales.
   The Des Plaines, Ill., maker of paints, chemical coatings
and detergents said it has already agreed to sell certain
assets for about $200 million, and it will distribute the net
proceeds from those sales -- expected to total $85 million,
or an indicated $20.94 a share -- to shareholders, in the
form of a special dividend.

   DeSoto said it also plans to tap the excess funding of its
employee pension plans, and distribute an additional about
$28 million, or approximately $6.90 a share, to shareholders
a year from now.
   The plan to nearly liquidate the company, which calls for
further payouts if DeSoto succeeds in closing agreements for
the sale of other operations, is subject to shareholder
approval, as well as regulatory clearance of the sales.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
DeSoto shares jumped $5.50, to close at $45.
   DeSoto's fight against an unsolicited $50-a-share bid from
Sutton led both parties into Delaware Chancery Court. As a
result of that litigation, said a DeSoto official, the court
"ordered DeSoto to maximize shareholder value." In an
interview, William L. Lamey Jr., vice president, finance,
called the planned sell-off of most of the company DeSoto's
response to that order.
   The Sutton bid, which has been repeatedly extended since
it was launched in November, has been viewed by investors
with considerable skepticism, as evidenced by the price at
which DeSoto shares have been trading. Officials at Sutton,
which currently holds a 15% stake, couldn't be reached for
comment yesterday.
   Courtaulds PLC of London definitively agreed to buy
DeSoto's industrial coatings business, for $135 million. The
U.K. concern, in turn, agreed to sell substantial portions of
the coating operations to Valspar Corp. of Minneapolis and
DSM Resins B.V. of the Netherlands.
   In addition, DeSoto said Witco Corp. of New York has
agreed to purchase the company's surfactant and emulsifier
lines. While it didn't disclose terms, Courtauld's disclosure
of the price it was paying indicates Witco paid about $65
million.
   DeSoto is also "very close to signing a definitive
agreement" for the sale of its domestic consumer paint lines,
said Mr. Lamey. Sales for the domestic paint operation, which
has reported operating losses in recent quarters, have been
estimated at above $150 million in 1989, out of DeSoto's
overall sales of $408.2 million last year.
   DeSoto is also negotiating the sale of certain proprietary
technology it holds for thickening-agents, and is "nearing an
agreement there as well," the official said.
   If the paint and technology sales go through, net proceeds
would additionally be distributed to shareholders, the
company said.
   "For the present," DeSoto said it plans to retain its
household detergent business, which contributed about $72
million in revenues last year.
