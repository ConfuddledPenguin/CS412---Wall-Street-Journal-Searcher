   NEW YORK -- The dollar regained some ground as foreign
exchange traders took some profits. The greenback also was
aided by a modest sell-off of the British pound and other
currencies supported by high interest rates.
   Currency traders groped for fundamental economic reasons
to buy and sell but found few. The consolidating tone of the
global session was set in Asia. Dealings were thin and --
prior to a late New York surge by the dollar against the mark
-- prices were bound by technical ranges.

   "People are simply too tired after all the movements the
past two days. They were pooped," said Paul Kazuo Okura, a
senior customer dealer in New York for Bank of Tokyo.
"{Tuesday} our dealers {in Tokyo} were staying up into the
wee hours of the night. {Wednesday} people were going home
early."
   The one unknown that had overhung the early session was
the contents of the final communique from the Group of Seven
industrial nations. But when the G-7 leaders broke up their 2
1/2-day meeting in Houston, they issued no news for the
foreign exchange market.
   Ever since a French newspaper reported last week that a
draft communique said the yen's "current {low} levels could
have undesirable consequences for the process of global
adjustment," currency-market participants had been expecting
a G-7 statement supporting the yen.
   The concluding comment didn't mention the yen, or any
other currency. It did reiterate that inflation requires
"continued vigilance."
   Afterward, Horst Koehler, state secretary in the West
German Finance Ministry, said: "The yen has appreciated in
the right direction. We're happy about that. There's no need
to comment on it."
   Shortly before the close of the Tokyo Wednesday morning
session, rumors that a Houston summit source said the
communique would call for a stronger yen pushed the dollar to
its intraday low of 147.55 yen.
   The rumors "triggered the market to go really short on
dollars," according to Mahiko Nagai, a trader with
Manufacturers Hanover Trust in Tokyo.
   Mr. Nagai and other Japanese dealers had warned that if
the economic communique disappointed dollar bears, the U.S.
currency could rebound to 149 yen.
   No rebound occurred. The greenback weakened against the
yen for most of the latter half of the North American session
and ended with its most paltry gains on the day against the
Japanese currency.
   Mr. Okura of Bank of Tokyo explained: "Most people in the
market do believe that the G-7 thinks that a stronger yen
would be good for correcting the {U.S.-Japan} trade
imbalance, so {the national leaders} don't have to say it."
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6560 marks, above 1.6425 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.50 yen, up
from 148.30 yen in New York Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.7990, well below $1.8230 Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 148.90 yen
soon after the opening, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
148.10 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.6580 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6418
marks.
   On Wednesday, Alexis Egan, corporate foreign-exchange
trader for Banque Indosuez, described the day as slow with
bursts of activity. She said the global session saw many
quick movements on cross rates, such as yen-mark and
yen-swiss, that suggested speculative rather than corporate
activity.
   Ms. Egan said the dollar-yen and dollar-mark movements, on
the other hand, were easy to call. For example, against the
West German currency, she said, the dollar had technical
resistance and support points at 1.6520 marks and 1.6380
marks, respectively.
   The British pound moved consistently lower throughout the
day. This wasn't the day of reckoning long predicted for
sterling speculators. Instead, several large sell orders in
Asia kicked off a round of across-the-board consolidation for
the high-flying currency.
   The pound ended global trading in New York at 2.9791 marks
and 267.15 yen, well below 2.9943 marks and 270.35 yen late
Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $354.10 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.7 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$353.15 an ounce.
