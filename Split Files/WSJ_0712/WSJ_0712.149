   NEW YORK -- The alleged leader of a tax-fraud scheme that
created $140 million in phony tax deductions was sentenced to
two years in prison.
   Jeffrey Feldman, 42 years old, of Skillman, N.J., pleaded
guilty in April to conspiring to defraud the U.S. The scheme
involved $4 billion in U.S. government securities
transactions that were rigged to create the fictitious tax
losses in 1981. The transactions were marketed to investors
for tax benefits through a series of limited partnerships
called the Cralin partnerships. Mr. Feldman was an owner and
promoter of Cralin.

   In sentencing Mr. Feldman, federal Judge Charles S. Haight
said he wouldn't impose a fine or order restitution because
the defendant has no assets. Mr. Feldman could be eligible
for parole after serving a third of his two-year sentence.
   Last month, Paul Foont, formerly head securities trader at
Cralin, was sentenced to one year in prison for his role in
the scheme. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary told Judge
Haight that because Mr. Foont acted as Mr. Feldman's "hired
gun" in the scheme, Mr. Feldman should receive a harsher
sentence.
   "Mr. Feldman was the motivating force behind these
transactions," Mr. Cleary said. "He's the one who profited so
handsomely from his fraud." Mr. Cleary said the transactions
generated a total of $1.2 million in tax-free income for Mr.
Feldman in 1981 and 1982.
   Mr. Feldman's attorney, Michael Feldberg, urged that his
client not be sentenced to prison, arguing that other people
involved with Cralin were more responsible. Mr. Cleary,
however, said there was no evidence that the other owners of
Cralin were aware of the scheme.
