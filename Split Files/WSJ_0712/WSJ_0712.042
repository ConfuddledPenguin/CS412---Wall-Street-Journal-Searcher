   In Ireland today the 300th anniversary of the Battle of
the Boyne is being celebrated. Orangemen in bright orange
sashes will march through Ulster, accompanied by drummerboys
beating drums with rattan canes. Paul Blanshard, an American
observer of Irish politics, noted 30 years ago that the
Orange drums "are often beaten so ardently by champion
drummers that blood from wounded wrists flows over the
surface."
   Violence between Catholic and Protestant Irish has often
marked the anniversary of the battle -- known as Orange Day
after William of Orange, its winner. Protestant Orangemen
used to celebrate the Boyne in New York City, but Irish
Catholic rowdies, with the acquiescence of passive
Irish-Catholic cops, brought the Protestant celebrations to a
stop. An Orange march in New York in 1870 was attacked by a
Catholic mob as police stood idly by. In 1871, 33 persons
were killed and 101 wounded on July 12. Since 1871, the only
Irish parade on Fifth Avenue has been St. Patrick's Day.

   Though now forgotten in America, the Boyne is still
remembered in Ulster. Thousands of Orangemen march through
the streets during "marching season" to commemorate what they
imagine to have been their glorious victory. But the
Ulstermen are wrong -- the Boyne was no more their victory
than it was the Irish Catholics'. The truth of the Boyne, Alf
McCreary, a Northern Irish journalist, wrote in May, "like so
much else in Irish history, is buried in the myth. And the
tragedy of Ireland is that myths are much more dangerous and
potent than the truth."
   In the folklore of Protestant Ireland, July 12 is the day
"when William of Orange, and our immortal forefathers,
overthrew the Pope and Popery at the Boyne. Then began the
era of civil and religious liberty." Catholic Irish believe
exactly the opposite. But actually, the Boyne was a struggle
between two non-Irish chieftains for control of the English
throne: the Calvinist Dutchman, William of Orange, who had
been installed as king a year and a half before in the
Glorious Revolution of 1688 and his Catholic father-in-law,
James II, who had been deposed in that revolution.
   Nor were the armies that did the fighting any more Irish.
William assembled a strange coalition of Dutchmen, Danes,
Germans, Swiss, Italians, Norwegians and disaffected French
Hugenots. (He shrewdly brought very few English troops.)
William's only Irish soldiers were a few ragged, fierce,
independent regiments of Scottish settlers from Londonderry.
James's army, less polyglot, was made up of professional
French soldiers borrowed from Louis XIV and some southern
Irish recruits, many of whom scarcely knew how to load a
rifle, much less how to shoot.
   Foreign troops were involved because the Boyne was a
skirmish in the long, extensive war between Louis XIV's
France and the rest of Europe, a war that lasted -- with
pauses -- from 1689 until 1714. Behind William stood a
non-sectarian alliance of Catholic Austria and Spain and
Protestant Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Behind James,
stood Louis.
   So when news of William's victory reached Europe, the
Catholic states of Austria and Spain "went into wild
rejoicing for William's victory," according to Peter
Berresford Ellis's "The Boyne Water." Te Deums were sung in
cathedrals. It is even said that Pope Innocent XI helped to
finance William's army.
   Catholic Europe was celebrating William's victory because
it meant that England would enter the war on the side of the
anti-Louis coalition. Nobody imagined that the Boyne
represented the triumph of Ulster-style Protestantism in
Ireland -- because it didn't. True, the Catholic religion was
savagely persecuted after William's victory. But so was
Ulster's Presbyterianism. In the "new era of religious
freedom," a Presbyterian minister was subject to three months
in jail for delivering a sermon and a huge fine of 100 pounds
for celebrating the Lord's Supper. In 1704, an Act of
Parliament excluded Presbyterians from office in the law,
army, navy, customs or municipal employment. Presbyterian
ministers were prohibited from teaching children.
Intermarriage between Presbyterians and Anglicans was
illegal.
   Religious oppression caused large numbers of Scots-Irish
to emigrate to North America in the early 18th Century,
chiefly to New England and Virginia. Ulstermen played a
decisive role in American colonial revolt against British
rule. Irish Protestants, not Irish Catholics, began the Irish
diaspora. Presbyterian Scots-Irish pressed for the separation
of church and state in the U.S. Constitution, in part to
ensure that the Anglican Church not become the state religion
of the U.S.
   A victory by James would have been no more rewarding for
Irish Catholics. No love was lost between James and the
Irish. He abandoned the Irish troops who served under him at
the Boyne, and blamed them for his defeat. A tale circulated
that when he arrived in Dublin after the battle he grimly
greeted the wife of one of his Irish officers with the
remark, "Your countrymen, madam, can run well." She replied:
"Not so well as Your Majesty, for I see you won the race."
The Irish knew James had no interest in Ireland other than as
a way-station on his return to England. For months after
James fled with his French troops, Catholic Irish troops
resisted the Williamites. To those bold hold-outs, James
became known as Seamus an Chaca, James the Dunghead.
   The centuries-long agonies of Northern Ireland have long
puzzled outsiders. But today, as continental Europeans try to
forget their long, conflict-ridden past, the deep, abiding
hatreds between Irish Protestants and Catholics seem more
incongruous than ever. This 300th Orange Day could be an
occasion for the Irish to dispel the myths that fuel their
animosities.
   But this debunking probably won't happen. This year's
Orange Day will be celebrated with more than usual vigor. The
Orange Lodge wanted to hold a religious service on the
original battlesite in southern Ireland. The plan failed when
the farmers who own the field asked 50,000 pounds ($91,000)
in rent and parking fees, plus hefty insurance. The price was
denounced as extortion by the lodge, by the leftist Farmer
Workers' Party and by Brendan McMahon, a member of the Fine
Gael Anti-Communist League in Southern Ireland. But then, the
Boyne always has inspired strange political alliances.
