   BAGHDAD -- When opportunity knocks here in the Middle
East, the one thing you can count on is that no one will
answer.
   The Arabs and Israelis seem like youngsters forever on a
see-saw, incapable of finding the point of equilibrium that
could permit them to dismount from their precarious perches.
When one side is up, it merely revels in the advantage, and
assumes it will last; when one side is down it merely pushes
that much harder to regain the heights. In the Mideast there
is no concept of balance of power; the only shared value is
search for advantage.

   The most remarkable statement by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, in the course of a recent 3 1/2-hour interview
replete with bellicose talk of the increasing inevitability
of war with Israel, was his admission that the Arabs made a
mistake passing up Israel's 1967 offer of land in exchange
for peace. Under that proposal Israel would have returned to
the Arabs most of the West Bank and Gaza, captured in the
June 1967 war, in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel.
   "The Arabs have made their mistakes," he said. So, here we
have the Arab world's most radical ruler musing about missed
opportunities for peace -- but nearly a quarter-century too
late.
   Meanwhile, in an Israel increasingly dominated by
political hardliners, that West Bank, once seen as a
bargaining chip for peace, is now considered an integral part
of the divinely demarcated Land of Israel. "The eternal right
of the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael is not subject to
question," say the new government's policy guidelines. Just
as the Arabs say they are ready to offer peace for land,
Israel is no longer willing to accept it. The prospect for
peace talks is dimmer now than at any time. Threats of war
are louder.
   There is every reason to believe Israel is repeating the
mistake the Arabs made -- missing a genuine opportunity. It
is however by no means certain that, if the West Bank were
back on the bargaining table, Saddam Hussein and his Arab
brethren indeed would trade land for peace.
   The last clear opportunity was 1983. Then, Egypt was
sidelined by the Camp David peace accord, Iraq was enmeshed
in war with Iran, Syria was ensnared in Lebanese strife, the
West was well past its oil fright and, most important, Israel
had Ronald Reagan, a committed ally, in the White House. The
problem: Arabs felt too weak while Israel believed itself too
strong.
   Since then, the see-saw has begun to tip again. The start
of the 1990s finds Iraq freed of its war with Iran but left
with a million-man army. Israeli-Egyptian relations have
soured. Radicalized Palestinians are creating continuing
turmoil in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. A
dispassionate President Bush and disgruntled James Baker have
replaced the pro-Israeli team of Ronald Reagan and George
Shultz. With the Soviet threat diminishing and U.S. budget
pressures growing, the rationale for spending $3 billion a
year in aid to Israel as a "forward base" in the global
anti-communist struggle seems less sustainable. Before the
decade is out, the West is likely to find itself needing more
Arab oil -- and thus listening more to Arab views.
   Finally, U.S. opinion polls are showing a tilt away from
unquestioning U.S. support for Israel. A recent New York
Times/CBS poll found support for a Palestinian homeland
rising to 47%, compared with 40% two years ago. And, while
61% of Americans favored high levels of aid to Israel, the
figure was 72% a year ago.
   The logical opportunity to strike a deal for peace? Not in
the endlessly illogical Middle East. The Israelis, who less
than a decade earlier felt themselves too strong to need
peace, now appear unaware of the degree to which the see-saw
is swinging to their long-term disadvantage. The Arabs, as
reflected by Saddam Hussein's staunch militancy, are probably
exaggerating how much it has swung in their favor.
   In the decade since Egypt signed a peace treaty with
Israel, Arabs have come slowly to realize there is no
military option to regain the occupied territories; only a
political one. Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, has minimally done what Israel and
the world demanded -- accepted Israel's right to exist.
Nearly two years ago, in a speech in Geneva that paved the
way for the first-ever PLO-U.S. dialogue, Mr. Arafat said
that the PLO accepts the "right of all parties concerned in
the Middle East conflict to exist in peace and security . . .
including the state of Palestine, Israel and other
neighbors."
   While Saddam Hussein blusters about retaliating against an
Israeli attack with chemical weapons, it's hard to conclude
that he seeks to initiate war. He and his key advisers appear
to recognize that Iran, not Israel, will continue to be
Iraq's major strategic threat. Beyond that, Iraq remains a
bitter enemy of Syria's Hafez al-Assad. Syria and Iran are
enough to preoccupy Iraq without war with Israel.
   The saber-rattling reverberating from Baghdad appears
largely intended to maintain Arab political and financial
support for Iraq. Most important, Iraq aims to keep the PLO
under its control rather than tolerate Syrian or Egyptian
influence, on the theory that the Arab nation controlling the
PLO and Palestinians wins Arab hearts and wallets.
   So, the most immediate threat to Israel's security is the
internal Palestinian uprising. The use of force hasn't calmed
Palestinians, who continue to insist on human rights and a
homeland. But neither the uprising, nor the longer trends
working against Israel, has so shifted the balance that
Israel ought to fear negotiating now. Israel remains far and
away the region's most powerful military power and continues
to enjoy strong U.S. support. The equilibrium is sufficient
to allow both Israelis and Palestinians to talk, to take a
chance that they can climb off the seesaw.
