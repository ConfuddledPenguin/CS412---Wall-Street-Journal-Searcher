   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will allow two
traders convicted on felony charges in federal court Monday
to continue trading futures contracts for their own accounts
at the Merc pending a hearing on exchange disciplinary
charges that could result in their being expelled from the
exchange.
   The decision reflects the widespread belief among Merc
members that the two traders in Swiss franc futures, Robert
D. Mosky and Danny L. Scheck, were found guilty of relatively
minor trading transgressions and were unjustly singled out
for prosecution by the government, the traders' attorneys
said. The Merc said the two couldn't handle customer orders.

   The Merc's decision is a "reflection of their sense of the
nature of the charges" against the traders, said Harvey
Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney.
   The two traders were found guilty in U.S. District Court
here Monday on a total of eight felony charges of violating
the Commodity Exchange Act. The traders -- along with fellow
trader David Zatz, who was acquitted of two felony charges --
had been charged with more than 100 felony counts in the
first trial to result from the government's sweeping
undercover probe of futures-trading fraud at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The eight guilty counts, seven against Mr. Mosky and one
against Mr. Scheck, involved $200 in customer profits,
according to the traders' lawyers.
   The jury couldn't reach a verdict on more than two-thirds
of the charges, including a tough racketeering conspiracy
charge against Mr. Mosky. The government said its initial
decision is to retry the traders on the deadlocked charges.
   In filing disciplinary charges against Mr. Mosky and Mr.
Scheck late yesterday, the Merc board of governors said it
will "carefully consider the gravity of the offenses of which
the defendants were convicted." A Merc spokesman said there
is no exchange prohibition against convicted felons owning
exchange memberships or trading.
   Mr. Mosky, 34 years old, a broker in the Merc's Swiss
franc futures trading pit, and Mr. Scheck, 28, a so-called
local Swiss franc trader who didn't handle customer orders,
were each charged by the Merc with one major and one minor
violation of catchall exchange rules.
   The major offense, for committing an act that is
"substantially detrimental to the interest or welfare of the
exchange," carries a maximum penalty of expulsion, a $250,000
fine, or both. The minor offense, for "conduct which has a
manifest tendency to impair the dignity or the good name of
the exchange," has a maximum penalty of a one-year
suspension, a $25,000 fine, or both.
   The board of governors' hearing on the charges isn't
likely to be held for a month or two, the Merc spokesman
said.
   The traders could also be subject to sanctions from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission based on the guilty
findings, once they have been sentenced.
