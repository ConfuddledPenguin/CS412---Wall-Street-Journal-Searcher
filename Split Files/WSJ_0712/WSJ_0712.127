   NEW YORK (AP) -- Magazine publisher Dale Lang said he
plans to launch a television network this fall that will
feature direct-response advertising programs and reruns of
classic television shows.
   Mr. Lang, chairman of the newly created Star Television
Network Inc., said 23 independent UHF stations -- reaching
more than 13.7 million of the nation's 92 million TV-owning
households -- have agreed to carry the service starting in
September.

   Stations that sign affiliation agreements will be given
eight hours of television programs a day, consisting of
movies, game shows and series like "Life of Riley," "The
Invaders" and "Richard Diamond," Mr. Lang said.
   In exchange for the programs, the stations must run at
least four hours a day of direct-response programs, also
called "infomercials." These are program-length commercials
in which a marketer typically demonstrates a product and
invites viewers to call in to order.
   Mr. Lang said Star Television and the producers of the
infomercials would share revenue from sales of the products
or services with affiliate stations.
   A spokeswoman for Mr. Lang couldn't say how much was being
invested in the new network. The network will be transmitted
to member stations via satellite.
   Mr. Lang also heads Lang Communications, a New York-based
media company that publishes Working Woman, Working Mother,
Sassy and Success magazines.
