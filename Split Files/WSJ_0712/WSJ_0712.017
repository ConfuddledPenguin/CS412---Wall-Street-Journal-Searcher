   Here is an explanation of the rise to celebrity of a
Brazilian frontier union leader, Chico Mendes, engineered by
an indefatigable international team of environmental
activists. Mr. Mendes's work as organizer of a national
federation of wild rubber tappers had achieved only small
notice outside his home state of Acre, when he was brought to
the U.S. and England to lobby in behalf of the Amazon rain
forest, a worthy cause that had become the latest object of
radical chic. His local enemies, indifferent to his growing
global fame, had him murdered in December 1988.
   Martyrdom is a common fate of rural labor leaders, priests
and lawyers in Brazil. Mr. Mendes was only one of 300 killed
in Brazil that year. But in the months following his death,
hundreds of reporters, investigators, would-be film makers
and biographers descended from all over the world upon Acre
to capture the "true story" of Chico, the rustic ecologist.
In fact, Mr. Mendes chafed under the designation: His primary
interest was helping his people make a living.

   Andrew Revkin's "The Burning Season: The Murder of Chico
Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest,"
(Houghton-Mifflin, 317 pages, $19.95) is the first to emerge
in the flood of Amazon books. It is undeniably partisan: Mr.
Revkin's heroes are Mr. Mendes and the environmentalists who
gained him his world audience. Yet he also offers detailed
closeups and honest and insightful commentary. "The Burning
Season" contains authentic voices of the Amazon's
inhabitants, villains as well as heroes, and sensible
judgments about their actions.
   Mr. Mendes's battle was against the land speculators who
were burning down immense stretches of rain forest. The
attack on the vast Amazon ecosystem, more than half of
Brazil's territory, accelerated in the 1970s as the
government built roads into the region. Migrants from
excessively subdivided small holdings and rapidly mechanizing
estates of the south swarmed in by the millions. Small
farmers account for only 30% of the clearing however. The
rest is the work of ranchers, some supported by subsidies,
who destroy immense tracts of forest for ridiculously small
numbers of cattle.
   Since wild rubber trees grow scattered in primary forest,
Mr. Mendes and his fellow tappers were its genuine protectors
and, since they enjoyed legally defensible squatters' rights,
they only could be dislodged by fraud and intimidation. This
is not a serious obstacle in Brazil, home to thousands of
highly professional claim jumpers and gunslingers, where
courts, police and politicians find bribery irresistible and
investigations exhausting and bewildering.
   For a brief period, Mr. Mendes found support in the
Communist Party, but as Mr. Revkin points out, his enduring
political connections were to the Workers Party, the
principal mainstream position in Brazil linked to the
Catholic left. Mr. Mendes's intelligence and dynamism were
displayed in adapting quickly to bargaining tables in
Brasilia and Washington, in forging links with tribal
Indians, and in refining nonviolent confrontational tactics
against the ranchers. Brazil needs more of his kind: honest
working-class leaders capable of resisting constant pressures
by an authoritarian elite that has engineered what may be the
world's most concentrated land holding.
   Indeed, the principal moral of Mr. Revkin's tale may be
the disastrous economic consequences of trampling civil
rights under foot. An entrepreneurial class that uses force
to acquire land and labor at bargain prices, and bribery to
gain credit from government banks at negative interest rates,
is not exactly what Schumpeter had in mind. These advantages
attenuate greatly the desirable concern for productivity. If
Brazilian ranchers were to expend as much effort in managing
their pastures as they do in intimidating their workers, they
could handily triple their output on existing acreage, and
the remaining Amazon could be left to slumber in peace for
another century.
   But it probably won't. Though Mr. Revkin hopes otherwise,
the rubber tappers, who struggle to have their groves
designated "extractive reserves," are very likely doomed by
competition. They require 700 acres to obtain an amount of
latex that can be gotten from a single acre of planted
rubber. Rubber farming also has the advantage of being
carried out in already deforested coastal areas that are much
nearer the tire factories. Wild rubber, furthermore, is
marketable only because Brazil imposes a 200% tariff on the
much superior Asian rubber and forces domestic tire companies
to buy the wild product.
   To assess the future is difficult. It is worth remembering
that, at this point, only about 10% of the forest has been
destroyed. Perhaps the ethnobotanists who now are rummaging
for potentially valuable plants will discover new wild
products, particularly medicines, that can be commercialized
to give the forests a lease on life.
   Whatever the eventual solution to the problem of saving
the rain forest, Mr. Revkin demonstrates how necessary it is
to establish an honest government in Brazil, responsible to
all its citizens for their irreplaceable patrimony.
