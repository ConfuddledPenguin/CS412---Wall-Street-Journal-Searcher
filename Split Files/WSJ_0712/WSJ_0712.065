   Delta Air Lines said it asked the National Mediation
Board, which oversees airline labor relations, to assign a
mediator to supervise contract talks. Delta's pilots are
represented by the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Atlanta-based Delta has been negotiating this proposed
contract with pilots for 18 months, and the main dispute is
over a lower wage rate in effect for newer pilots. Pilots say
they want an end to the scale, which is known as a "B-scale"
and has been in effect since 1985, when the airline industry
was racked by fare cuts.

   Although the pilots' contract was up for renegotiation in
March 1989, under airline labor law the provisions of a
contract are binding until a new one is signed. Delta had
asked for a mediator's help in negotiating the current
pilots' contract. "We're very optimistic it's going to be
resolved," said a Delta spokesman, adding: "We think having
outside help will help move things along."
   Officials of Delta's pilots' union disagreed. "We are
disappointed that management could not handle this family
issue privately without involving external parties," said
Capt. Jim Gray of the pilots' union.
   Under terms of a recent Delta proposal to its pilots, a
copy of which was obtained by this newspaper, the company is
offering wage increases of about 11% to pilots with six to 12
years' experience, and 34% to 51% to first officers with two
to five years at Delta. Although that would narrow the
discrepancy between what "A-scale" and "B-scale" pilots are
paid, it wouldn't eliminate the two-tiered system.
   Delta refused to comment on the details of any offers. A
pilots' spokesman said a more recent offer contained slightly
different numbers.
   The only union among Delta's employees is the pilots'
union; the airline has never been struck.
