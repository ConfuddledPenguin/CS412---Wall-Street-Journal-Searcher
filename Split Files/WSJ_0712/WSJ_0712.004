   Perhaps the only thing to really regret about the Houston
economic summit is that the leaders of these seven great
nations didn't get the opportunity to take in a little
country-western music during their time deep in the heart of
Texas. But maybe they didn't need to. The six men and one
Iron Lady appear to already know one of the ten commandments
of country music: Don't do tonight what you'll regret in the
morning.
   Such famed party animals as Helmut Kohl, Francois
Mitterrand and the world environmental movement had hoped the
Group of Seven would join them for a couple of truly wild
schemes -- bailing out the collapsed Soviet economy with
billions of dollars in direct aid or committing the incomes
of their peoples to solving the "greenhouse effect." Neither
happened. In fact, reports yesterday said that what kept the
leaders' aides up till 4 a.m. Wednesday was work on a
remarkably positive compromise on agricultural subsidies.

   We have a few caveats, but on balance, it seems that for
all the heady talk about a world in transition now, the
industrial leaders handled some tough economic matters with
prudence and good sense. For this outcome, President Bush
deserves some credit.
   The two big issues at the summit were Soviet aid and world
agricultural subsidies. No one would have been very surprised
if Mr. Bush, a help-Gorbachev man, had signed on to some sort
of plan to start aid or credit flowing toward the Kremlin.
But no such cave occurred. With support from Maggie Thatcher
and Toshiki Kaifu, Mr. Bush got a final communique that
reflected the plain reality of the Soviets' economic
prospects: not good without "radical" changes.
   The communique's approving use of the word "radical,"
normally avoided by diplomats, is telling. "Radical" is the
term that the Soviet Union's proponents of the free-market
use to describe themselves. Some of these radicals have been
particularly critical of what they describe as Mr.
Gorbachev's "half-measures." The G7 will now send to the
Soviet Union an economic team to discover what most everyone
already knows about that country's "needs." It will be
interesting, and possibly even amusing, to see what the
free-market Soviet radicals make of their visitors from the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   Prodded by the U.S., the communique also laid down a
relatively tough foreign-policy marker as a precondition for
financial support, despite a threat by a Gorbachev aide in
recent days that "we aren't taking orders." The communique
said the Soviets should shift resources "substantially" out
of the military sector and "quit support to nations promoting
regional conflict." Translation: Drop Castro. The Cold War
may be over, but it's reassuring to see attention given to a
proper mopping-up exercise.
   The resolution of the agricultural dispute -- a commitment
to "substantial reductions" in export subsidies, internal
price supports and import barriers -- will keep the Uruguay
Round on track. But the extraordinarily hard-line position
that the Europeans brought to Houston remains troubling.
   All this talk about how their farmers are the Continent's
"social fabric" raises the prospect of an almost medieval
Fortress Europe. In Houston, this issue was teed up as an
American-European dispute. But what message is the European
Community sending to the farmers of emerging economies in
Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, Ukraine and Asia? To
put it politely, the message isn't attractive, and unless the
GATT negotiators press hard to unwind this subsidy structure,
as U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter seems intent on
doing, the global economy is in for endless conflict.
   Members of the environmental congregation will howl at the
summit's disinclination to order up an immediate end to
global warming, but the summiteers appropriately balanced
such goals with legitimate, competing interests. Among our
problems with the environmentalists is that they seem to
think that their agenda must supersede all the other normal
concerns of humankind -- growth, feasibility, science, costs,
alternative investments (for presuming to give voice to these
concerns, John Sununu is demonized). The G-7 nations must
find a way to integrate themselves into a world of collapsed
communist economies and developing nations around the globe.
The useful message the Houston summit sent the
environmentalists is that their cause is worthy but not
pre-eminent.
