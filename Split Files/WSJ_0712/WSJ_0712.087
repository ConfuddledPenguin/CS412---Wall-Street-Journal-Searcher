   A recent 30-second spot for Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee
starts out as clear and concise as could be, with bold shots
of the vehicle and music swelling in the background. But all
of a sudden, things aren't so clear any more: In the next
several seconds, five different, often lengthy disclaimers
flash on the screen in tiny, eye-straining type.
   In rapid fire, viewers with exceptional vision may be able
to spot almost a dozen different warnings, from "see dealer
for details and guaranteed claim form" to "deductibles and
restrictions apply." Then again, maybe not.

   Supers -- as the lines of minuscule type that are
superimposed on the bottom of ads are called -- are growing
out of control, critics charge. Faced with a growing number
of legal and network restrictions, advertisers have loaded up
their ads with so many tiny lines of type offering product
disclaimers that even TV addicts with photographic memories
couldn't decipher all of them. Network executives are
starting to wonder how to tackle the monster they've created
-- a monster sprung largely from their own tangle of rules
and regulations. Bleary-eyed consumers, meanwhile, are
beginning to get angry at the onslaught.
   Consumer advocates charge that advertisers are stuffing
their ads with supers only because they don't really want to
disclose the information in the first place. "Marketers try
to make this type as inconspicuous as possible," sniffs Alex
Markovich, a senior editor at Consumer Reports magazine.
"Consumer suspicions should rise in direct proportion to the
lack of legibility of the message on the screen."
   Clearly, supers are no longer limited just to aspirin
commercials warning "use only as directed." Federal
regulations have made car makers perhaps the worst offenders.
Other big guys like American Express and AT&amp;T also fill their
ads with supers.
   Network executives say they're policing such ads and are
cracking down. "We often require revisions to supers to
ensure that they're legible," says Matthew Margo, vice
president of program practices at CBS. Some commercials, he
says, are "so saturated and cluttered with supers that it's
impossible to read."
   Mr. Margo, though, says CBS takes into account the media
buy behind a heavily supered ad when deciding if it is
acceptable. If an ad will run many times, CBS may be more
lenient in giving it the green light. Like other networks,
CBS has policies regulating the number of seconds supers must
stay on the screen.
   But Mr. Markovich and other consumer watchdogs argue that
if the fine print in commercials is important enough to be
included, it should be read loud and clear, on equal footing
with the rest of the announcer's script. Print ads are filled
with supers, too, but "at least there's some chance with a
print ad that a consumer can finally get the message if he or
she is determined enough," Mr. Markovich says.
   Even some advertisers concede consumers aren't served
particularly well by ads loaded with supers. "I can't say
that the legal requirements always add to the clarity of the
ad," says Dennis Driscoll, senior vice president at Fidelity
Investments. Fidelity's TV ads are jam-packed with supers
giving information about the "fund adviser" and "transaction
expenses," among other things.
   So confusing was one recent Fidelity ad that Consumer
Reports chided it, singling it out as one of the worst
offenders of fine print in advertising. The ad, Consumer
Reports wrote, "had four separate messages in blurry
legalese. The only understandable message there," according
to the magazine, "is `beware.' "
   Mr. Driscoll acknowledges the Fidelity ad is packed with a
lot of information. "Balancing good communication with the
legal requirements is difficult," he says. "What you're after
is a good clear sense that the consumer knows what we're
offering. . . . I think our ads do that."
   Jeep says the recent ad for its Cherokee has more supers
than usual because the ad promotes both a rebate and a
"0%-financing" special. "There were more disclaimers on that
ad than we usually like to use," says Tom Peyton, Jeep's
advertising manager. "But there is absolutely no intention at
all to deceive anybody."
   Advertising executives, for their part, insist supers play
a positive role in advertising, by helping consumers get more
information about a product or service. "I am not suggesting
that the ad industry is saintly," says Elaine Reiss,
executive vice president and general counsel at Ogilvy &amp;
Mather. "But I don't think any responsible advertiser or
advertising agency wants to intentionally harm consumers."
