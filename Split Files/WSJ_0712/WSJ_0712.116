   HAMILTON, Bermuda -- Sea Containers Ltd. more than doubled
its quarterly common stock dividend to 35 cents a share from
15 cents.
   The shipping concern, which announced the move at its
annual meeting, said the increased dividend would be payable
Aug. 12 to stock of record Aug. 6.

   Sea Containers also said its board, before year end, will
consider paying a stock dividend and retiring the company's
highest dividend preferred stocks. Sea Containers has four
sets of preferred. Its convertible cumulative preferred, with
about 176,000 shares outstanding, pays the highest dividend
at $4.125 a share per year.
   Sea Containers said that decisions regarding the stock
dividend and the retiring of some preferred stocks have been
delayed because of "technical and tax considerations." The
company didn't elaborate.
   Sea Containers' president, James B. Sherwood, said the
company's ferry and port revenues were slightly below
predicted levels for the year to date. But he added that
those figures were offset by a drop in fuel prices and the
strength of the British pound, which will translate into
greater dollar profits.
   Mr. Sherwood also said that container lease revenues are
roughly in line with expectations, with weak demand for some
older refrigerated containers being compensated by
higher-than-expected demand for other types.
   Mr. Sherwood didn't provide any specific figures for
expected revenue or earnings.
