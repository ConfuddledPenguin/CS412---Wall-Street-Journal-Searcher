   SAN FRANCISCO -- Transcisco Industries Inc. said it won't
acquire Piper Aircraft Corp.'s aircraft-parts business as
previously agreed.
   Transcisco agreed early last month to acquire the Piper
business, but said yesterday that it allowed the letter of
intent to expire June 30. The companies decided that "it was
not in their best interests" to carry through with the
transaction because of "unresolvable business issues,"
Transcisco said.
