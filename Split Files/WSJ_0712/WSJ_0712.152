   Dixons Group PLC of Britain, a consumer electronics
retailer, said pretax profit for the year ended April 28 rose
2.2% to #80.1 million ($145.9 million) from #78.4 million a
year earlier, as advances in British retailing offset a
decline in U.S. earnings.
   The results, slightly exceeding market expectations and
Dixons' own estimate, are the first since the government in
May blocked a #461 million bid for Dixons by Kingfisher PLC,
a British retailer, on the ground that the acquisition would
have been anti-competitive.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests and before
extraordinary items rose 7.4% to #57.7 million from #53.7
million. Per-share earnings increased 8.6% to 12.6 pence from
11.6 pence. An extraordinary loss of #9.8 million represented
the costs of the defense against the Kingfisher bid;
year-earlier results hadn't any extraordinary items. Profit
attributable to shareholders, after taxes and special items,
fell 11% to #47.9 million from #53.7 million.
   Sales rose 1% to #1.77 billion from #1.75 billion.
