   GREENSBURG, Pa. -- Sulcus Computer Group said its
negotiations on the acquisition of Cam Data Systems Inc.,
Fountain Valley, Calif., have been suspended for three to six
months. The company didn't elaborate on why the talks were
suspended.
   In June, the two companies announced the signing of a
letter of intent. Terms at the time called for Sulcus to
exchange each share of Cam Data for one share of Sulcus, plus
one warrant of Sulcus for every two shares of Cam Data.
