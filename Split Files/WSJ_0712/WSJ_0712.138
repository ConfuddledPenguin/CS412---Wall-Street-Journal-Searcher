   HOUSTON -- Chiles Offshore Corp., a drilling contractor,
said it signed three-year charter agreements to lease three
mobile offshore drilling rigs, with options to acquire each
of them.
   The agreements cover the Johnnie Hoffman, Penrod 96 and
Penrod 97 jackup drilling units, each capable of operating in
water as deep as 250 feet. The leases call for profit-sharing
arrangements of 75% to Chiles and 25% to the owners, all
affiliated with a Norwegian investor, after Chiles has
recouped its operating costs.

   Chiles's exclusive option to purchase the rigs expires
Nov. 30, after which it has the right to match any purchase
offers.
