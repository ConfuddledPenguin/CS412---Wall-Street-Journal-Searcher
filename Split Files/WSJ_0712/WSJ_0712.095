   GENEVA -- The ruling body of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) gave the go-ahead to Venezuela's
membership application yesterday.
   A trade official said that as a condition of joining the
96-nation trade forum, which sponsors agreements to
liberalize world trade, Venezuela had agreed to limit import
tariff levels to 50%, and to reduce them to 40% within two
years.

   Venezuela is the first member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to seek GATT membership.
The country derives 90% of its export income from oil, which
is covered by OPEC's production regulations.
   The trade official said GATT's regular council meeting
also heard that agreement had been finalized on the opening
of South Korea's markets to imported beef.
   Under the agreement, Seoul has to import at least 58,000
tons of beef this year.
