   Tokyo stocks finished firmer as domestic-demand related
shares bounced up on the yen's sharp advance and on lower
interest rates on the bond market.
   London shares, meanwhile, rallied at the close of moderate
trading, with dealers citing a weaker pound and a strong Wall
Street performance.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 141.75 points to
32294.18.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose
230.07 points to 32524.25.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, up from 352 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 546 to 385, while 193 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section rose 13.80 points, or 0.59%, to 2351.57.
   The second section index advanced 19.07 points, or 0.43%,
to 4406.74. Volume in the section was estimated at 39.7
million shares, in line with 40.1 million shares Tuesday.
   As the dollar remained below 149 yen yesterday morning in
Tokyo following its substantial fall over the past few days,
stock prices moved narrowly at higher levels, helped by
rebounds on domestic demand-related shares such as
shipbuilding, construction, electric utilities and mining
companies.
   As the dollar further weakened, falling below 148 yen, the
Nikkei Index climbed as high as 32456 points midafternoon,
pushed up by buying by investment trust funds and
arbitragers, before declining on profit-taking, traders said.
   The firmness of the stock market relieved some traders who
had anticipated that concern about an official discount rate
increase by the Bank of Japan would continue to hurt the
stock market.
   Local analysts denied a possibility of an immediate
increase of the discount rate, with domestic prices remaining
stable in recent months.
   The stock market used to react wildly to the strengthening
of the yen, as it prompted expectations for lower domestic
interest rates. But yesterday's gains were rather modest
compared with the past, traders said.
   Because participants are sharing a belief that domestic
interest rates will remain at a high plateau for the
foreseeable future, the yen's strength wasn't able to prompt
active buying yesterday, observers said.
   Higher bond prices helped reduce anxiety about a discount
rate increase, but weren't enough to recall sidelined
investors, traders noted.
   Unless the yield on the 10-year government bond drops one
percentage point from the current 7.2%, the stock market
won't gain real energy, said Naoya Ozawa, research director
at James Capel Pacific, adding that such a drop is unlikely.
   Hironobu Hagio, manager of equity division at Nippon Life
Insurance, said "investors are losing confidence because they
haven't made profits (on stocks this year). A great number of
investors are sitting back and just watching the developments
on the currency market."
   Yesterday's advancers included shipbuilding companies,
such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which was up 18 yen to
990 yen (12 cents to $6.68). Also, interest rate-sensitive
electric power companies rose, with Tokyo Electric Power
advancing 150 yen to 4270 yen, while Chubu Electric Power
increased 80 yen to 3330 yen.
   Among domestic demand-related shares, construction and
housing issues gained broadly. Shimizu rose 50 yen to 2080
yen, and Daiwa House was up 50 yen at 2570 yen.
   Kirin rose 70 yen to 1880 yen, as the company raised 1990
sales and profit projections in view of unexpectedly strong
demand. Kirin's pretax earnings are now seen at about 75
billion yen, up 28% from the prediction of 58.5 billion yen.
   Kirin's gain also prompted buying for other breweries,
traders said. Asahi Breweries gained 20 yen to 1800 yen.
Sapporo Breweries rose 30 yen to 1600 yen. The rise in U.S.
shares helped London sustain early gains caused by an easing
pound. This removed some of the pressure from those stocks
that are heavily exposed to currency-exchange rates, with
most of those companies' earnings from overseas markets.
   Despite the rally, profit downgradings continued. But
after the battering to the market caused by downgradings in
recent sessions, dealers chose to ignore the fresh signals.
However, traders noted that some of the firming has to be
ascribed to markups by brokers.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
up 33 points, at 2360.5, the day's high. The Financial Times
30 Share Index was up 22.7 points at 1877.7. Volume was 447.8
million shares, edging up from Tuesday's 442 million issues.
   Among the handful of shares to ease were Lonrho, down a
penny to 262 pence ($4.77), Hawker Siddeley, down 5 pence at
610 pence, and Carlton Communications, down 4 pence at 509
pence.
   Meanwhile, Dixons rose 4 pence to 143 pence; the company
disclosed a 2.2% gain in pretax profit for the year ended
April 28, ahead of market forecasts.
   Granada slumped 13 pence to 218 pence after reporting a
12% decline in pretax profit for the half-year ended April
14.
   Those benefiting from a weaker pound included Reuters, up
24 pence at #12.83; Glaxo, up 23 pence at 852 pence; and
British Airways, up 3 pence at 218 pence.
   Rothmans gained 25 pence to 825 pence.
   Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich and Amsterdam, lower in Brussels, Stockholm and
Madrid, and mixed in Milan. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and Hong
Kong, mixed in Wellington and Manila, and lower in Seoul and
Taipei.
