   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc. said it is in the
final stages of negotiations to sell its automotive
electric-motors division to a unit of Siemens AG of West
Germany.
   The sale would represent Magna's first significant
disposal of an operating unit since March, when the company
announced plans to sell various assets as part of a program
to restructure 1.09 billion Canadian dollars (U.S.$941.4
million) in debt.

   Magna, an auto-parts manufacturer plagued by overcapacity,
didn't disclose an asking price for the Maci Group division,
a unit of Magna's Atoma International Inc. subsidiary. Some
analysts estimate the unit could sell for about C$70 million.
   aul Klapproth, a spokesman for Siemens Automotive LP, said
"a number of points have to be resolved" before the deal is
finalized. The transaction also would require Canadian
regulatory approval.
   Toronto-based Magna said the Maci Group, with five plants
in Ontario and a distribution center in Michigan, generates
annual sales of about C$120 million and has 1,200 employees.
   Siemens Automotive, based in Troy, Mich., manufactures
electronic components for automobiles out of facilities in
Ontario and Virgina. Mr. Klapproth said the proposed
acquisition would fit with Siemens Automotive's strategy of
expanding in North America.
