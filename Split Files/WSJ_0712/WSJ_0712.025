   The PC rental business is finally gaining a little
respect.
   Big personal computer makers and retailers are beginning
to take an interest in the ragtag network of rental outfits
that has quietly become, by some estimates, a $500
million-a-year industry growing at a 35% annual clip.

   But the rental industry hasn't really caught on with the
public yet. No big name springs to mind when it comes to
renting PCs. Many consumers and businesses don't even know
they can rent a PC to alleviate peak workloads, test new
hardware options and avoid the hassle of carrying a machine
on business trips, according to PC rental companies.
   That could change soon. Some big computer makers,
tantalized by the industry's growth, are taking steps to help
rental outlets become more visible. International Business
Machines Corp., for example, is experimenting with
authorizing companies to rent its PCs. Digital Equipment
Corp. also is moving ahead with an authorization program for
its desktop computers -- a program it says now extends to 18
U.S. outlets and has already proved a hit in Europe.
   At the same time, large computer retailers have stopped
ignoring the growing, wide-open market. Most notably,
Businessland Inc., the nation's largest PC retailer,
continues to roll out its Businessland Rents division, with
the East Coast as its next target. It already has rental
centers in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago
metropolitan areas, and says PC rental is one of its
fastest-growing sectors.
   No one is sure that these industry leaders can make a
dent, but established outfits say they're hopeful that the
aura and dollars of Businessland, IBM and Digital will
inspire even more rapid growth in the rental market -- even
if they also inspire increased competition.
   "Big companies like IBM can help educate people," says
Gail Ray, president of Simtec Computer Rentals, a Troy,
Mich., subsidiary of Inacomp Computer Centers Inc. "It will
have a major impact, if only because the industry's No. 1
problem is a lack of awareness."
   Simtec is one of three rental centers chosen by IBM for
its pilot authorization program. The other two are
Businessland Rents locations in California. At each center,
IBM will educate employees about its products and provide
marketing help. In return, IBM gets increased exposure for
its products and control over how they're serviced and
supported.
   Scott Stein, who follows the PC industry for International
Data Corp., thinks such programs will attract new customers.
"If IBM and other vendors decide to take this market
seriously, that ensures a good level of support. Suddenly,
renting a personal computer becomes a more attractive
option," he says.
   "The business will become more professional because of
this," agrees Simtec's Ms. Ray. "IBM's leadership will help
turn the industry into a Hertz, as opposed to a bunch of
small rental-car companies that you aren't sure will still be
there when you get to the airport," she says.
   For the moment, however, the industry is populated mostly
by mom-and-pop outlets that reach their customers through the
Yellow Pages. Although some larger firms operate nationwide,
such as GE Rent/Lease, an Atlanta-based division of General
Electric Co. and PCR Personal Computer Rentals Inc., a
franchiser based in Cranbury, N.J., analysts say most PC
rentals are handled by entrepreneurs working from single
locations. Rental rates typically run from $100 a month for
an old model to $100 a day for a powerful new machine.
   "This is the kind of business that can be, and often is,
run by a smart guy with a big garage," says Seymour Merrin, a
Palo Alto-based consultant who follows the PC retail market.
   But such entrepreneurs face three disadvantages that
analysts say may allow big players such as Businessland to
commandeer and expand the market -- especially if they gain
the lion's share of authorizations from major manufacturers.
   First, credibility. Yellow Page listings are an efficient
way to reach occasional renters, but they don't create demand
or establish a strong company image. Larger-scale advertising
isn't cost-effective for most entrepreneurs, however, and
outbound sales calls are tough sledding without an
established image.
   Second, financing. Computer renting, with its large
inventories, is a very capital-intensive business. Although
profit margins are generous -- much higher than in the
suffering PC retail market -- upfront investments are
prohibitive for anyone without deep pockets or a sympathetic
banker.
   Ms. Ray of Simtec, for example, found that her rental
operation blossomed when she sold it to Inacomp, a leading PC
retailer. "It was like marrying a rich man," she says. "They
had the money, they had the clout, they had the attention of
financial institutions. It was like night and day," she says.
   The third disadvantage entrepreneurs face is service.
Above all, people who rent PCs want assurances that they
won't have any problems. But such assurances are hard to make
without a large support staff and a big inventory of
replacements. "People need to know that if there's trouble,
someone will be right there to fix it," says Mr. Stein of
International Data.
   As a result, many small rental operations are girding for
a period of consolidation. And bigger operations, protected
for years by the relatively small size of the market, are
bracing for new competition.
   "We're obviously concerned," says Michael Meduri,
president of National Micro Rentals Inc., a franchisee and
majority shareholder of PCR. "Some of the large retailers
could put equipment out at very aggressive rates if they so
chose, and the margins are certainly attractive enough," he
says.
   Mr. Meduri says he's looking into getting IBM
authorization for the 54-franchisee PCR, to buttress its
position against newcomers to the rental market. Also
interested in authorization is GE Rental/Lease, which says
it's talking with several manufacturers and is confident it
can maintain its recent annual growth rate of about 40%, even
if competition tightens.
   Businessland, which is concentrating on renting to big
corporations, thinks there's plenty of room in the market for
everyone: "There's a legitimate need (for rented PCs), and a
growing realization that there is a solution available," says
Brian Leeland, vice president of Businessland Rents. "But
many people still have to make that realization, so the
market will keep growing," he says.
   "Rental is so much in its infancy that it has a long, long
way to grow," agrees Ted Books, marketing director for
Veritechnology Electronics Corp., a Cie. des Machines Bull
unit that operates 60 computer retail stores nationwide.
   Mr. Books says Veritechnology, which operates its stores
under the Heath/Zenith Business Centers banner, is seriously
considering catching the new rental wave. "It takes a big
investment," he says. "But it's companies that pay the ante
now that will get the big payoff in a couple of years."
