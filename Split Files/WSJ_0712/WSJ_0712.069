   DALLAS -- MCorp, a bank holding company, said it
definitively agreed to sell its Waco, Texas, bank to a
private investor group led by Gerald J. Ford, a Texas banker
who also heads First Gibraltar Bank, the state's largest
thrift. Terms weren't disclosed.
   MCorp, which has been operating under federal
bankruptcy-court protection since last year when federal
regulators seized most of its banks, said it expects to
complete the sale of the Waco bank by year end. MCorp said
the unit has assets of $333 million.
