   HOUSTON -- General Homes Corp. said three bondholders
filed a petition with a Houston court to force the company
into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   The home builder, which stopped making interest payments
on its 12% subordinated notes due in 1998 2 1/2 years ago,
said the bondholders are seeking to force the company to
liquidate.

   Among the bondholders filing the petition in the Houston
federal Bankruptcy Court is veteran investor Stanford Phelps
of S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., a Greenwich, Conn., bond broker. In a
similar move last year, Mr. Phelps forced MCorp, a
Dallas-based bank holding company, into seeking the
protection of the court after he purchased $2 million of
MCorp's distressed debt at a hefty discount and threatened
the banking concern with an involuntary petition.
   In the General Homes petition, Mr. Phelps demanded that he
and a business associate be placed on the company's board. "I
don't think those boys know how to turn the company around,"
Mr. Phelps said, referring to General Homes' current
management team. "We're just trying to fix their mess."
   For more than two years, General Homes has been trying to
restructure about $250 million in senior debt and $140
million in subordinated debt. Offers to exchange two issues
of subordinated notes for convertible preferred stock failed
this spring. Since then, the company said it has been
negotiating with its lenders, including Citibank, to avoid
filing for protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
   W.A. Le Sage, General Homes president, said the company
plans to pursue an out-of-court settlement. "It is my
understanding that senior bank lenders and shareholders
prefer to work this out outside bankruptcy courts," he said.
   Analysts say that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would be
costly and could scare off both customers and suppliers, a
move that could "wipe out the company," said analyst Kevin J.
McCabe of R.D. Smith &amp; Co. Under Chapter 11, the company
continues to operate under court protection while it devises
a plan to repay creditors.
   But Mr. Phelps isn't likely to go away quietly. "Stan
Phelps is very rigid," said analyst Kenneth Campbell of
Montvale, N.J.-based Audit Investments Inc. "His style is
simple: Buy cheap bonds and rattle the cage of management
until he makes a good profit. They either buy him out to shut
him up or put him on the board."
   Mr. Le Sage, meantime, insisted that the company wouldn't
give in to Mr. Phelps's demands. "This guy swoops into town
and threatens our company with all sorts of demands and
threatens to throw us in the can," Mr. Le Sage said. "We told
him our people don't react well to blackmail."
