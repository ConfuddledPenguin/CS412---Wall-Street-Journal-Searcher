   WASHINGTON -- George Bush has finally bitten the bullet on
taxes. Now it may be the Democrats' turn to chew some lead.
   The question is Social Security, an issue that over the
years has been as politically potent for the Democrats as
no-new-taxes was for the GOP. Now, with the president willing
to put taxes on the table, Democratic budget negotiators may
have little choice but to risk the wrath of the elderly and
agree to pare back benefits.

   The numbers make a compelling case. Social Security
accounts for $1 of every $5 the U.S. government spends, and
it's hard to see how the participants in the budget summit
can meet their goal of an honest $50 billion reduction in the
federal deficit without making some savings in the program.
   At the moment, two benefit-reduction ideas are being
floated. One is the direct approach: a reduction in
cost-of-living adjustments. The other is indirect: increasing
the income tax on Social Security benefits.
   Either way, many Democrats remain terrified at the
prospect. "It's just one of those political givens that it's
scary" to touch Social Security, says Robert Strauss, a
former Democratic National Committee chairman. Both within
and outside the budget summit, though, it's widely believed
that Congress and the public will back a deficit-reduction
plan only if everyone sacrifices -- including the elderly.
   Some observers already detect subtle changes in how the
once-sacrosanct program is being viewed today. "Go back and
look how the media portrayal of the elderly has changed,"
says Fay Cook, a Northwestern University professor of social
policy. "Articles talk about how active they are, how
well-to-do." For years, economists have been pointing out
that children may be more deserving of government aid than
older people -- and some members of Congress are listening.
After all, nearly 20% of all children live in poverty,
compared with 12% of the aged.
   Even some older people's lobbyists sound conciliatory --
up to a point. "We are explicitly saying that old people need
to be part of the solution. We don't need to be exempted,"
says John Rother, director of public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons. But he adds that the "special
character" of the Social Security trust fund must be
"respected." That's a polite way of saying: Keep your mitts
off Social Security.
   The only obvious alternative is to charge the elderly more
for Medicare, the federal health-care program. But budget
negotiators are talking about getting at least $3 billion
from benefit programs for the elderly in the first year-in
addition to whatever savings the government gets by squeezing
doctors and hospitals -- and as much as $50 billion over five
years. Congressional analysts say it would be tough to get
that much money from Medicare beneficiaries in the first year
without very sharp increases in the $383 annual premium and
$75 annual deductible for doctors' services.
   When the budget summit turns to Social Security, cutting
cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, is appealing because it
saves so much money, and because a COLA freeze can spread the
pain of deficit-reduction across a wide array of programs. A
three-month delay in making the adjustments for all
government benefits except those exclusively for the poor
would cut the deficit by more than $3 billion next year. It
would cost the average retiree about $85 next year.
   One rub is that trimming COLAs hurts those who depend on
Social Security checks for survival as well as those who
don't need the money. Although programs aimed exclusively at
helping the elderly poor could be increased to cushion the
blow, congressional analysts say that wouldn't protect all
the low-income elderly. Two-thirds of all Social Security
benefits paid to the elderly go to those well above the
poverty line. But Census Bureau surveys show that Social
Security is the only source of income for millions of poor
elderly Americans.
   The bigger problem with cutting COLAs is political. No
sooner did House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D.,
Calif.) put the idea on the table than Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.) and Sen. Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.) predicted it would die on the table. The
only reason to even mention it is to make other money-saving
proposals look more appealing, Sen. Domenici says.
   Sen. Domenici and others were seared by a 1985 vote by the
Republican-controlled Senate to cut COLAs. The plan died when
President Reagan pulled the rug out from under them.
Democrats turned the vote into a campaign issue, and some
Republicans say it cost them control of the Senate.
   Already, the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare has sent out mass mailings urging the
elderly "to stop a cut in your Social Security benefits which
would cost the average retired couple $2,820 over five
years." (The estimate refers to a proposal to suspend COLAs
for one year.)
   All this is nudging the summit toward an increase in the
tax on Social Security benefits. Couples with incomes above
$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 now pay
tax on 50% of their benefits. About one-fifth of all Social
Security recipients pay; the revenue goes back into the
Social Security trust fund. Subjecting 85% of the benefits to
taxes would cost a well-off retired couple with annual income
of $60,000, including $10,000 in Social Security benefits,
about $1,000 a year in higher taxes.
   The appeal of this approach is that it doesn't hurt the
poorest of the elderly. "Obviously, the case for taxing
benefits is much stronger" than for cutting COLAs, says
AARP's Mr. Rother. It also would raise lots of money. Rep.
Panetta has offered a plan to tax 85% of the benefits paid to
couples with incomes of $18,000 and individuals with incomes
of $12,000; it would bring in $3 billion next year.
   It does have two political liabilities. Unlike a COLA
freeze that could be applied to civil service and military
pensions and, therefore, could be sold as an across-the-board
money saver, the tax change would single out Social Security.
And the tax increase would hit the well-organized
middle-income and upper-income elderly who led the campaign
for repeal of Medicare's catastrophic-illness coverage. But
neither of these liabilities appears to frighten the summit
negotiators much.
   Complicating the summit's discussions of Social Security
is Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), who loudly points out
that the government is collecting billions more in Social
Security payroll taxes than it spends in benefits -- and is
using the money to make up the deficit in the rest of the
government.
   "Social Security didn't put us in the situation we're in
with the deficit," says Max Richtman, director of
governmental affairs for the National Committee to Preserve
Social Security. "It's running at a huge surplus."
   To deflect criticism, the budget summit is almost certain
to redefine the deficit to exclude the Social Security
surplus. Then trimming Social Security benefits wouldn't make
the deficit look any smaller. But, in fact, no matter how
Congress decides to rewrite the accounting rules, all
government receipts go into one big pot. If the pot is
inadequate, the Treasury borrows money. Cutting benefits
would still reduce the government's need for borrowed money,
and that's the point of the budget summit.
   So in the end, Congress would probably count Social
Security cuts, if it makes them, toward its deficit-reduction
goal even as it takes the program out of the deficit
calculation. "Emerson said consistency is the hobgoblin of
small minds," says summit negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,
Minn.). "We do not have small minds."
   Confronted with the same issue, Rep. Panetta, pretending
to be a magician, opens the left side of his jacket and says,
"Goes in here . . . ," then opens the right side and says, ".
. . comes out here."
