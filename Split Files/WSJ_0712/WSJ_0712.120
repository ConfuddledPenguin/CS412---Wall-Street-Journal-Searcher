   Regal International Inc. said a debt holder would receive
a 45% stake in the company in exchange for cash and the
cancellation of debt.
   The Houston oil field services concern said that under a
recapitalization program, Polystar Corp. will exercise its
options for the purchase of 12 million shares of common stock
and in exchange will cancel about $2.7 million of Regal's
debt and pay the company $570,000 in cash. Polystar, a unit
of Zurich Corp. of Greenville, N.C., will hold about 45% of
Regal's 26.5 million shares outstanding upon completion of
the deal.

million at March 31.
