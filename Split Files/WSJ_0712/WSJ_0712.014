   WASHINGTON -- Senate investigators accused Johns Hopkins
Hospital, one of the nation's most prominent hospitals, of
having shoddy billing practices that apparently resulted in
excessive Medicare payments.
   The accusation came at a hearing by the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which has asserted that
Medicare improperly pays up to $1 billion a year in medical
claims that should be covered by private insurance companies.

   The hearing was an outgrowth of a Wall Street Journal
article last year that examined Medicare's Secondary Payer
program, under which private health plans -- not Medicare --
are supposed to provide primary insurance coverage for the
working aged.
   The subcommittee said it "uncovered failures at all levels
of the health care process . . . including instances of
waste, fraud and abuse." Despite more than two dozen
government investigations and reports since 1983, the
problems remain unsolved, witnesses said.
   One reason cited for the improper payments was that some
hospitals fail to fulfill their legal responsibility to
collect accurate insurance information from elderly patients.
"Hospitals, whether knowingly or as a result of carelessness,
submit claims to Medicare using improper codes in an attempt
to expedite payment," charged Sen. William Roth (R., Del.).
   According to Senate investigators, Johns Hopkins submitted
bills to Medicare using a billing code that stated patients
were unemployed -- and thus the responsibility of Medicare --
when in fact it hadn't bothered to learn whether they were
covered by other health plans. Johns Hopkins, which is in
Baltimore, was one of several hospitals committee
investigators looked at. The panel gave no specific figure
for the amount of Medicare overpayments it believes resulted
from the hospital's billing practices.
   Joanne Rodgers, a spokeswoman for the hospital, denied the
committee's allegations. "We are in compliance with all the
Medicare regulations as we understand them," she said. "We
don't believe we are guilty of anything, including shoddy
billing practices."
   Sen. Roth said insurance companies also contribute to the
billing problem by capitalizing "on what can be charitably
described as gross inefficiencies in the administration of
Medicare to evade their legal obligation to pay claims."
