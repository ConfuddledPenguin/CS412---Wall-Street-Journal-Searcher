   Kane-Miller Corp. said it dropped a threatened proxy fight
for representation on the board of Amrep Corp., a New York
real-estate developer.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Kane-Miller cited California developer Peter Bedford's recent
decision to increase his stake in Amrep to 16.1% in
explaining its decision not to seek seats on Amrep's board.

   Kane-Miller, a Tarrytown, N.Y.-based food processing
concern, owns 8.1% of Amrep.
   An Amrep spokesman declined to comment on the Kane-Miller
filing.
   In its latest filing, Kane-Miller reiterated that it
acquired its stake in Amrep for investment purposes, but that
it would consider seeking control of the company.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amrep closed unchanged at $8 a share.
