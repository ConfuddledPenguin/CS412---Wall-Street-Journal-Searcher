   LOS ANGELES -- Where would Armand Hammer be today without
the financial backing of Frances, his late wife?
   The answer may not seem to have much interest outside of
the Hammer family, except that it could affect the future of
a museum planned by Dr. Hammer to house hundreds of millions
of dollars of art works in his vast collection.

   Frances Hammer's estate filed a $400 million lawsuit
against the 91-year-old industrialist and Occidental
Petroleum Corp., the oil and chemical company he heads,
charging them and other defendants with breach of fiduciary
duty and fraud. Joan Weiss, the daughter of Frances Hammer's
sister, is Mrs. Hammer's heir, the suit says. Her husband,
Robert S. Weiss, is the estate executor and plaintiff.
   A spokesman for Occidental and Dr. Hammer declined to make
any comment on the suit, filed yesterday in state court here.
   The suit traces certain financial aspects of the couple's
33-year marriage and suggests that Dr. Hammer's huge wealth,
including his art collection and Occidental stock, were
amassed using separate property Frances brought into the
marriage. Mrs. Hammer died in December.
   Dr. Hammer allegedly exercised complete control over the
fortune he and Frances acquired during their marriage. Almost
all of their Occidental stock, with a market value of more
than $34 million as of Dec. 1, was allegedly held in Dr.
Hammer's name. Dr. Hammer treated the art works he had
purchased using his and Frances Hammer's property as his own,
according to the suit.
   "Frances Hammer's . . . rights with respect to their
community property were inconsistent with Armand Hammer's
desire to use and control their fortune for his own selfish
purposes. Accordingly, Armand Hammer embarked upon a scheme
designed to take from Frances Hammer his interests in their
fortune," the suit says.
   The estate's interest in the art collection, which has
been valued at as much as $400 million, surfaced this spring
at a Wilmington, Del., court hearing. The proceeding was
related to litigation brought by certain Occidental
shareholders who are trying to block the oil company's $95
million plan for a museum to house the art collection. The
plaintiffs argue that the museum, under construction in Los
Angeles, won't benefit shareholders and is Dr. Hammer's pet
project.
   Alan R. Kahn, a New York investment adviser who sued
Occidental over the museum last year, said that the estate's
suit throws another wrench into the planned museum. "If the
title and transferability of much of the Hammer art
collection is under a cloud, then expenditures to build a
museum are even less justifiable."
   Also named as defendants were the Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Cultural Center, the Armand Hammer Foundation, and
Lewis, Overbeck &amp; Furman, a Chicago law firm, and two
partners.
