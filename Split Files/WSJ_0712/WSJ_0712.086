   MANZANILLO, Mexico -- The gales that buffet this big
Pacific port never hindered exporters as much as the
dilapidated two-lane highway leading here from the produce
markets of Guadalajara. "When that road went out, meat and
vegetables would sit rotting in trucks," says Antonio Rivas,
a port official.
   The road to Manzanillo will soon be less toilsome.
Construction crews are finishing work on two additional
lanes, which should nearly halve the time of the five-hour
trip from Guadalajara. What makes the project really notable
-- a complete departure from Latin American traditions -- is
that much of the investment is coming from a private company.

   As Mexico accelerates its export-based growth plan by
seeking a free-trade pact with the U.S., the country's
decaying infrastructure has emerged as the "Achilles heel of
the economy," according to Ernesto Warnholtz, head of
Mexico's largest exporters association. To resolve the
problem, the government is pursuing an ambitious plan to cede
control of projects like roads, bridges and ports to the
private sector.
   Since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in
December of 1989, the government has awarded private
concessions for 1,600 miles of four-lane highways that will
be operated as toll roads. About 900 additional miles of
highways will be put up for bid soon. Officials in Mexico
City have called on private investors to bid on concessions
for bus routes. Private concerns are also being given a
greater hand in investments in ports and thermoelectric
plants.
   Above all, Mexico is counting heavily on foreign investors
to finance infrastructure. The government has designated
infrastructure projects and privatization of government-owned
enterprises as the only two areas that will be open to
investors participating in its revamped debt-for-equity swap
program. The first round of bidding on the swaps, in which
the government and its lenders transfer Mexican foreign debt
to investors in return for equity in investment projects, is
scheduled for this month.
   While not all businessmen are eager to sink their money
into such long-term, brick-and-mortar projects, the mere idea
of allowing private investment in infrastructure represents a
radical change in Mexico. In part, the government
stranglehold on infrastructure reflected statist economic
policies long prevalent in the developing world. Also,
pork-barrel projects like roads and bridges helped Mexico's
ruling political party achieve the longest-running reign in
the non-Communist world.
   But the money to support such projects dried up with the
emergence of the 1982 debt crisis. Since then, more than half
the Mexican budget has been directed toward service of its
domestic and foreign debts. Total public investment fell to
3.5% of gross domestic product last year from 12.5% of GDP in
1981. Infrastructure bore the brunt of the cuts.
   -- Public investment in roads has declined to 0.35% of GDP
last year from 0.75% of GDP in the late 1970s. Some 2,000
miles of highways and 5,000 miles of rural roads are needed,
beyond the 2,500 highway miles already up for bid, according
to Victor Mahbub, subsecretary of infrastructure in the
Mexican Transportation Ministry. Almost all the bridges in
the country, he adds, need to be refurbished.
   -- Public investment in rural development has fallen to
0.35% of GDP last year from 1.4% in 1981. Investment on
construction and maintenance of irrigation projects has
fallen by 90% in real terms since 1981, with a resulting 20%
decrease in total acreage under irrigation. Private farmers
have also cut expenditures. The number of new tractors
purchased fell to 5,800 last year from 18,600 in 1981.
   -- Public investment in electricity has fallen by 60% in
real terms since 1981, to its level of the mid-1970s,
according to a study by Mexico's major business lobby.
   How badly Mexico's infrastructure had deteriorated became
evident last year when the economy began growing at twice the
pace originally projected by the government. Suddenly,
bottlenecks attributable to shoddy infrastructure emerged in
nearly every sector of the economy.
   Indians in the mountains of southern Mexico were reduced
to bartering a pound of corn for a pound of coffee, which is
10 times more expensive. The reason: It was almost impossible
to transport corn up the mountains from the northern
farmbelt. Grupo Gutsa S.A., a leading conglomerate, couldn't
find any ships to import ingredients for a popular brandy it
produces.
   "Everyone in business here became aware that the lack of
infrastructure might stop Mexico from growing," says Juan
Diego Gutierrez Cortina, president of Gutsa.
   Since Gutsa also has a construction subsidiary, it has
been able to do something about the problem. The company will
soon finish work on a $30 million international bridge
between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas. Border businessmen
are thrilled that the bridge will speed the flow of traffic
between assembly plants on the Mexican side of the border and
warehouses on the U.S. side. Gutsa and other construction
companies are also happy to have work again after seeing
business plummet because of the debt crisis.
   One big problem is financing. Interest rates in Mexico
have been prohibitively high since the economy soured. To
help finance the bridge, Gutsa's bank made the first issue of
infrastructure bonds in the local stock market. The Gutsa
issue was well received, but analysts say it will be
difficult weaning Mexican investors away from
higher-yielding, shorter-term investments such as government
treasury bills. "Almost nobody in Mexico knows what it is to
save over the long-term," says one government finance
official.
   Catching the eye of foreign investors, who would be
allowed up to 49% participation in most projects, is another
big challenge. So far, according to Mr. Mahbub, one foreign
group nibbled on a highway project, but finally backed off to
invest in a business that offerred a faster return. He says
inquiries from foreigners are increasing.
   Some businessmen say that the government has to do more to
make the investments appealing. With public investment in
railroads falling by 50% in real terms since 1985, the state
railroad monopoly recently began allowing private companies
to buy or lease their own boxcars. But business has reacted
coolly, because companies who buy their own boxcars don't
receive a discounted shipping rate. "Things are moving in the
right direction, but there's still not enough incentive for
the private sector," says Juan Manuel Correa, general manager
of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. office in Mexico.
