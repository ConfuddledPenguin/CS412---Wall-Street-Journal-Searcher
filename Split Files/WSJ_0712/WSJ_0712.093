   NEW YORK -- The stock market, propelled by an
across-the-board rally in oil issues and several waves of
futures-related buying, moved sharply higher in moderate
trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored its biggest gain
in about a month by climbing 41.83 to 2932.67 -- about three
points away from its all-time high of 2935.89, set June 15.

   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
jumped 4.74 to 361.23, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 2.35 to 197.11 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 3.85 to 335.79. Advancers led decliners on the
New York Stock Exchange by 971 to 506.
   Big Board volume rose to 162,220,000 shares from
147,630,000 Tuesday, reflecting what several traders
described as only a modest increase in activity by
institutional investors despite the market's steep climb.
   "Certainly the volume doesn't show that institutions are
heavily involved," said W. Daniel Williams III, a vice
president of trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co., adding that buy
programs linked to stock-index arbitrage "were floating
around, in and out, at different points of the day."
   The bulk of the arbitrage-related buying -- purchasing
baskets of stocks and selling futures contracts to lock in
profits from differences in price between them -- hit the
market from midday onward, traders said.
   Meanwhile, at least five major brokerage houses made
favorable comments on oil stocks following two developments
that pointed to a possible cutback in the world's oversupply
of petroleum:
   -- News that oil ministers of five Persian Gulf nations,
all members of OPEC, agreed that the cartel should maintain
its current output ceiling of 22 million barrels a day until
oil prices rise to an "acceptable" level.
   -- Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute that
showed that inventories of crude oil fell nearly 3.7 million
barrels last week, a sharper decline than expected.
   The futures price of crude oil for August delivery went up
53 cents a barrel in New York trading, to $17.47, after
climbing 36 cents a barrel Tuesday. By comparison, the five
OPEC oil ministers agreed that the current priority is to
restore oil prices to "at least" $18 a barrel.
   Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said
both oil stocks and oil prices may continue to advance if the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets
July 25, can rein in overproduction among some of the
cartel's members. That possibility "is enough to make some
investors throw their hat in the ring" and buy the stocks, he
said.
   Activity was especially brisk in Unocal, which gained 1
1/2 to 27 3/4 in Big Board composite trading of 1.6 million
shares. Among other oil issues, Exxon advanced 1 1/8 to 47
7/8, Chevron climbed 1 5/8 to 71, Texaco went up 1 3/8 to 58,
Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 61 5/8 and Amoco rose 1 1/4 to 51 3/4. Du
Pont, which owns Conoco, rose 1 to 38 3/8.
   In the oil field-services sector, Baker Hughes rallied 1
3/8 to 27 3/4, Schlumberger gained 1 3/8 to 57 5/8,
Halliburton rose 1 3/4 to 47 3/4 and Rowan climbed 5/8 to 11
7/8.
   Shares of food and drug retailers rallied as the market
responded favorably to quarterly earnings reports from
Safeway, which gained 1/2 to 16 5/8, and Walgreen, which
climbed 2 1/2 to 52 7/8. Safeway's second-quarter earnings
more than tripled from the year-ago level; Walgreen reported
a 13% increase in net income for the fiscal quarter ended in
May.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, a specialty retailer, added 1
1/2 to 24 7/8. The company said it is comfortable with Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons' second-quarter earnings estimate of 20 cents a
share, revised upward Tuesday from 17 cents.
   Investors also continued to favor other issues viewed as
most likely to deliver better quarterly earnings. Among blue
chips, Philip Morris added 1 1/8 to 49 1/4, Merck rose 1 7/8
to 88 1/4, Boeing advanced 1 1/2 to 61 1/2 and General
Electric rose 1 3/8 to 72 1/8.
   Earnings-related selling hurt Hilton Hotels, which dropped
1 1/2 to 51 1/2. The company reported that second-quarter net
fell 9% from a year earlier; analysts had generally expected
the company to report higher earnings.
   Systems Center, which estimated that it would report a
second-quarter loss of between 22 cents and 25 cents a share,
plummeted 4 1/8 to 17 7/8 on 586,900 shares -- more than 22
times its average daily volume. Also, John J. Barry resigned
as the company's president.
   DeSoto, whose board approved the sale of two subsidiaries
for $200 million, jumped 5 1/2 to 45. The company said it
plans to distribute proceeds from the sales, as well as
excess funds in its pension plans and proceeds from sales of
two other units currently on the block, to its shareholders
after setting aside reserves for taxes and repaying debt.
   American Cyanamid rose 1 to 60 7/8 as rumors circulated
that Warner-Lambert may be interested in acquiring the
company in a stock swap. Both companies declined to comment
on the rumors after they surfaced earlier this week.
WarnerLambert added 7/8 to 66.
   Ferro advanced 1 1/4 to 27 3/4. The State of Wisconsin
Investment Board disclosed that it has a 5.1% stake in the
company. A spokesman for investor Jon M. Huntsman, who has
clearance to purchase as much as 15% of Ferro's common stock,
said the board's purchase won't affect Mr. Huntsman's plans.
   Cray Research advanced 2 3/8 to 47 3/8 after Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood repeated a buy recommendation on the stock.
Analyst Roger W. Redmond said he expects the company to post
strong second-quarter earnings; his estimate for the period
is $1.20 a share, compared with 15 cents in the year-ago
period.
   Hartmarx, which said it plans to shut down 65 stores and
sell its minority interest in an affiliate as part of a
restructuring, rose 1 to 11 3/8. The company reported a
second-quarter loss of $2.80 a share, including restructuring
charges, and cut its quarterly dividend 50%, to 15 cents a
share.
   Sea Containers jumped 4 1/8 to 66. The company increased
its quarterly payout to 35 cents a share from 15 cents.
   Public Service of New Mexico jumped 2 to 11 3/4. The
company said it had received "a preliminary expression of
interest" about a possible takeover from Wheeler Peak
Capital, where Al Robison, a former chief financial officer
of PS New Mexico, currently works.
   Network Equipment Technologies fell 1/2 to 8 1/4 on 1.1
million shares, including a single block of 898,600 shares,
representing a 6.5% stake. The block was traded at 7 3/4.
   Berlitz International, spotlighted in yesterday's "Heard
on the Street" column in this newspaper, went down 1 to 21.
Before the setback, the stock was trading at 36 times its
earnings for the past 12 months; even fans of the company
acknowledge that the stock is pricey, the Journal reported.
   Amre rose 1 3/8 to 6 after reporting that continuing
operations recorded a profit in the fiscal quarter ended in
April, compared with a year-ago loss. Separately, its board
approved the buy-back of as many as one million common shares
-- about 7.1% of its shares outstanding.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.68
to 359.41. Volume totaled 13,500,000 shares.
   Sanifill gained 2 1/8 to 27 1/8. The company said it
signed letters of intent to acquire three disposal sites for
non-hazardous waste; the site locations weren't disclosed.
   Balfour Maclaine climbed 1 1/8 to 7 5/8 following news
that top money manager Mario J. Gabelli, a director, nearly
tripled his stake by purchasing 13,000 shares last month.
