   NEW YORK -- Federal bank regulators ordered U.S. banks to
write off an additional 20% of their $2.9 billion in loans to
Argentina and, for the first time, 20% of their $11.1 billion
to Brazil.
   Bankers privately confirmed that in recent days they have
received letters from the Interagency Country Exposure Review
Committee, consisting of the Federal Reserve Board, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the
Currency, ordering them to take the accounting actions.

   The surprise move by the committee isn't expected to
affect earnings of heavily reserved banks, such as J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. But at those
with lower reserve levels, especially Citicorp, the action is
expected to heighten pressure to increase reserves in coming
months. Citicorp, for instance, will have to charge off about
$650 million of Brazilian loans against its $3.3 billion
loan-loss reserve. However, it won't have to charge off any
more of its Argentine loans because it did so in the first
quarter. Citicorp's loss reserves could be boosted through a
combination of asset sales and new capital, but it said it
doesn't expect that to be necessary.
   For such low-reserve banks, the action comes at a
particularly sensitive time. They already are being buffeted
by problem real estate loans, stringent loan reviews by
regulators and weak corporate borrowing demand. Furthermore,
the write-down of Brazilian loans could make future debt
negotiations more rancorous between the banks and Brazil,
which is undergoing a wrenching economic restructuring and
had hoped for some forbearance while it sought firmer
economic footing. Neither Brazil nor Argentina is currently
paying principal or interest on its bank debt.
   James J. McDermott, research director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc., said: "Candidly, the banks didn't need this. It
raises a question of whether a third round of reserves is in
store for some banks. The problem becomes one of market
perception about the adequacy of reserves and whether they
need to be replenished."
   Moreover, banks needing to bolster reserves face an uphill
battle raising new debt or equity. Many banks' stocks are
trading below their book values, and nearly 50 of the largest
bank organizations in recent months have seen their credit
ratings downgraded. Even high-quality banks are feeling the
effects. Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One Corp. recently faced
an unusually long and thorough 90-day review period for a new
equity issue.
   A Citicorp spokesman said, "While we can't comment on or
confirm" actions by the regulatory committee, "we can point
out that Citicorp disclosed in the first quarter that it had
written down 60% of its Argentine exposure" against its loss
reserve with no impact on earnings. "Any other write-downs,
voluntary or mandated, would likewise be charged to the
reserve without earnings impact," the spokesman added.
   Spokesmen for the Fed and FDIC declined to comment on the
committee's action.
   Analysts in the past have criticized Citicorp for what
they consider insufficient reserves, and the regulatory
action is likely to intensify those concerns.
   Carole Berger, an analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc., said: "For some of these banks, this isn't
small potatoes. This is going to reinforce the
lesser-developed-country loan issue for banks like
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical
Banking Corp. and Citicorp."
   H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner with the law firm Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell specializing in banking law, said: "This doesn't
reduce capital ratios, but it does lower the levels of
reserves as a percentage of nonperforming assets. The
reserves won't be as strong as they once were."
   The 20% write-off of Argentine debt, the third time a
reduction in valuation has been ordered, had been expected
and was less alarming to analysts because banks' Argentine
exposure ($2.9 billion owed the 36 largest banks) is
generally far lower than the amounts owed by Brazil ($11.1
billion for those same banks.)
   However, the Brazil write-off was unexpected. Under its
new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil is in the
midst of a major restructuring of its economy, and the new
administration has indicated an interest in reaching a new
bank debt agreement. Indeed, some bankers, including Citicorp
Chairman John S. Reed, have indicated that they expect talks
with Brazil to resume this fall or winter.
   Consequently, many have assumed that the regulatory
committee would give Brazil some breathing room before
declaring any of the Brazilian loans impaired. However, the
committee consists of bank examiners who may not be attuned
to the intricacies of international diplomacy, according to
regulatory sources.
   In fact, some analysts expect the committee's move to make
the Brazilian debt negotiations more difficult. As C.J.
Lawrence's Ms. Berger said: "All this puts the banks in a
terrible bargaining position."
