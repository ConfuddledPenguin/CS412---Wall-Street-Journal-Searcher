   NEW YORK -- Fred R. Bleakley resigned as editor of
American Banker, a daily newspaper owned by Thomson
Publishing Corp.
   Mr. Bleakley, a former deputy business editor of the New
York Times, said he resigned because of a disagreement with
George W. Landgrebe, president of American Banker, who had
hired Mr. Bleakley. "George and I couldn't reach agreement on
my proposal to report directly to him," Mr. Bleakley said. "I
wasn't comfortable with other executives getting involved."

   Mr. Bleakley had been editor since April 1989, when he was
hired to thoroughly redesign the paper.
   A successor to Mr. Bleakley wasn't named and executives of
Thomson Publishing couldn't be reached for comment.
