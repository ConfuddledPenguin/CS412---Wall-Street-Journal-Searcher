   CHICAGO -- Details of a study comparing the effectiveness
of three blood pressure drugs on black patients were released
prematurely, the American Medical Association said.
   Late last week, newspapers, including The Wall Street
Journal, and broadcast media around the U.S. ran accounts of
the study, conducted by researchers at the University of
Maryland and funded by Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle unit.
Contrary to the accounts, the study doesn't appear in the
July issue of the AMA publication, Archives of Internal
Medicine.

   The premature release "was the result of overzealousness"
by Burson-Marsteller, a public relations agency retained by
G.D. Searle and the University of Maryland, the AMA said.
Because of the breach, editors of the AMA publication
considered rescinding acceptance of the study, but later
decided to publish it in their August issue.
   Representatives for Burson-Marsteller, Searle and the
University of Maryland said they were embarrassed by the
foul-up, and regretted the early release of the data.
