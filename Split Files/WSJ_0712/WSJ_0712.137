   Douglas Short, general manager of the branch, said many of
the bank's 20 foreign exchange staffers have been offered
jobs in the Singapore branch.
   Chemical, which has its chief Asian foreign exchange
operations based in Tokyo, said the move is aimed at
consolidating its non-Japanese regional treasury and trading
operations.
   It also announced plans to close its Taiwan branch in
three to four months.
