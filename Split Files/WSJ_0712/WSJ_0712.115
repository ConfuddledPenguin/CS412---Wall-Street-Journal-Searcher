   Shorewood Packaging Corp. directors authorized the New
York-based maker of paperboard packaging to buy as many as
one million, or 7.6%, of its 13.2 million common shares
outstanding, in open-market transactions.
   The authorization will be 1.5 million shares after a
3-for-2 stock split, payable about Aug. 6. After the split,
Shorewood will have 19.8 million shares outstanding.

   Chairman Paul B. Shore said the company has completed a
capital spending program. "Absent a major acquisition, which
we have not identified at this time, we believe that the
optimum use of the free cash flow currently being generated
by Shorewood is to repurchase our shares," he said.
   The company's packaging is used in diverse industries,
including music, home video, tobacco, film and cosmetics.
