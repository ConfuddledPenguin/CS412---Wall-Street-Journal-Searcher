   Okemah, Okla. -- You may think you've heard all the
collapse-of-the-cold-war stories there are to tell. Prague,
Lithuania, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin. But what about Okemah?
Okemah? Yes, it's taken a spell for glasnost to reach this
small farming town. But come Saturday Okemah finally will
make its peace with the cold war too, as July 14 becomes an
official city holiday marking the birthday of its most mythic
native son, Woody Guthrie -- writer, balladeer, philosopher,
patron saint of the homeless, and antecedent to Bob Dylan and
the American folk song movement.
   Though his music is familiar to many ("Hard, Ain't It
Hard," "This Land Is Your Land"), Guthrie himself is not. His
recordings are kept respectably but quietly alive (the
Library of Congress recordings are on Rounder Records in all
formats; RCA and Smithsonian/Folkways also hold large
catalogs). Most listeners find his romantic legend easier to
take than his dour voice, which was flat, dry and airless.

   Or his politics, which were communist.
   That's why there's recently been a little tiff in Okemah
over Woody, the latest of several over the years. The issue
is always the same. Some think the town ought to give
official honor to its most famous citizen -- and maybe
promote a little tourism on the side. Others say no. Guthrie
was a communist, they insist, and Okemah's got no business
honoring a Red. In 1990 it is a debate that seems to come
from some past age.
   So does Okemah, where Guthrie was born in 1912 and where
the clocks seem to have stopped sometime around 1940. A gas
station still flies the old Sinclair dinosaur. There are no
parking meters, only one telephone exchange, and the nearest
stoplight is in the next county. At 10 a.m. it's 97 degrees
and the main street of storefronts is deserted. A man is
vacuuming the lobby of the old Crystal Theater at 4th and
Broadway, where you can see "Opportunity Knocks" for $2. They
say Woody Guthrie used to sing here.
   If he came back today, he'd probably feel right at home.
His sister, Mary Jo, lives 20 miles southwest in Seminole.
The sidewalk at 510 Broadway still holds the inscription he
is said to have scratched into fresh cement at 15 ("1927
Woody"), and the Guthrie family plot lies in the cemetery
north of town.
   Cleda Brandon went to high school with Woody and still
lives in the house her grandmother bought in 1923. It sits on
concrete blocks over a crawl space on 5th Street. Ms.
Brandon, who has the pale, pudgy face of a Cabbage Patch Kid
with dark buttonlike eyes framed in a Brillo pad of gray
hair, likes talking about Woody, whom she hasn't seen since
1928.
   Was he a Communist? "Oh I don't know," she says in a
birdlike voice. "I just remember him as a poor little boy."
   Barton Webb, 62, doesn't see it that way. A former Marine
tech sergeant who served in World War II and Korea, he flies
the American flag 24 hours a day over the Webb Funeral Home
on the west edge of town. For 30 years he's made it his
business to stop any city council votes honoring Woody
Guthrie.
   When he was elected to the five-person council in 1985,
his views acquired the authority of public office. "A lot of
these ol' boys make Woody Guthrie out a hero," he said
recently while relaxing in his back yard. "He was no hero. He
was a damn communist bum who never even served in the armed
forces. That doesn't sit well with the majority here. But you
got a couple of new teachers, and they come in here and push
this hero stuff. They're dupes, ignorant fools. And hell,
none of them's ever been in the service."
   Last year Mike Hagy, 29, a former Okemah schoolteacher who
had turned to selling forklifts, got tired of Mr. Webb's
talk. "He's a good man, but I resented him walking around in
a pompous, flag-waving manner as if God had christened him
with special knowledge about Americanism."
   When he learned Mr. Webb was pushing the council to remove
the words "Home of Woody Guthrie" from the town water tower
facing I-40 from 8th Street, he decided to run for Mr. Webb's
seat in the next election.
   "Webb was making Okemah look stupid," he said. "Across the
country Woody Guthrie is a respected folk hero who's been
honored by presidents. And here we are in the town where he
was born squabbling over whether he was a communist or not.
How can anyone who wrote `This Land Is Your Land' be
un-American?"
   Mr. Webb can answer that one, thank you. "You know what
that song's about, don't you?" he says. "He resented big land
owners; thought land should all be redistributed and given
away. That's socialist, plain and simple. Wake up. He even
stole the tune from someone else. He's not even worth talking
about."
   During the years when the Great Guthrie Debate hung on
whether he was actually a communist or not, those who
supported the folk singer had one nasty problem. Mr. Webb was
substantially correct. Joe Klein's biography, "Woody Guthrie:
A Life" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1980), which both sides accept,
leaves no doubt that Guthrie was, if not a dues-paying party
drone, at least a communist by spirit and conviction. Maybe
he even was a bum by some definitions, though in the dogma of
the old left a bum was a kind of noble proletarian savage.
And, yes, the tune to "This Land" was indeed "stolen" from a
Baptist hymn called "Oh My Lovin' Brother," though such
borrowing was a common practice in folk music, where oral
traditions outweighed copyright legalisms.
   Yet, with most of the facts on Mr. Webb's side (Guthrie
did serve in the Army in 1945), his water-tower motion died
last year for lack of a second, and he lost his council seat
to Mr. Hagy, 672 to 230. But he insists the majority of
people still support him. "They just didn't want to get
involved."
   Mr. Hagy thinks something more fundamental has happened.
"After years of arguing over Woody's politics," he said
recently, "it suddenly didn't seem to make any difference any
more. Who really cares what he was at this point? It's his
music that counts."
   For an unreconstructed cold warrior like Mr. Webb, this
was an ill wind. One can fight a war without a god any time,
but never without a devil.
   Is any of this worth writing about today? I think yes.
Because historians with an eye for the arcane may one day
note that here on July 14, 1990, an age in America finally
went from a pin-light spot to black. As the East Germans sell
off chips of the Berlin Wall to tourists at a nice profit, we
may have witnessed in Okemah the final murmur of
international communism as a live issue in an American
election.
   Behind it lay a battlefield of cold-war artifacts --
Woodstocks, microfilms, pumpkins, loyalty oaths and a
yellowed thesaurus of campaign buzzwords: egghead, dupe,
fellow traveler, card carrying. Now in Okemah it all seems to
be sliding into history, not with a bang, but a hootenanny
this Saturday in the Crystal Theater with Larry Long and
Fiddlin' Pete.
   And when Mr. Hagy soon moves to rename Broadway Guthrie
Boulevard, odds are good the motion will pass.
