   THE TAR RIVER SPINY MUSSEL lives a quiet life in the
clear, fresh waters of Swift Creek, a tributary flowing into
the mollusk's namesake. Kathy A. Smith lives in nearby Red
Oak, N.C., leading a not-so-quiet life selling prefabricated
cabins by telephone. For 90 days earlier this year, Ms. Smith
and the mussel were in the public eye together, as the
unassuming 39-year-old telemarketer found herself walking the
often fine line between economic opportunity and
environmental protection.
   Ms. Smith's saga began when two friends asked her to sign
a petition protesting plans by a Martin Marietta Corp.
subsidiary to open a crushed-granite quarry in their rural
area. The neighbors worried about noise, dust and trucks; Ms.
Smith, an amateur naturalist, worried about the quarry's
intrusion on the pristine Swift Creek area. "I can't fight
against dump trucks but I've always loved wildlife," she
explains.
   Telephone in hand, Ms. Smith began a series of phone
calls, first to private wildlife and environmental groups to
which she had contributed money in the past, and then to
state agencies. Yes, she was told by the private groups,
digging quarries can displace ground water that in turn can
pollute nearby streams. No, she was told by the state, the
issue of possible environmental damage to creeks and rivers
hadn't come up in the Martin Marietta application.
   Then Ms. Smith spoke with John Alderman, a senior
biologist with the state's Wildlife Resources Commission, and
learned two interesting facts. First, Swift Creek, which
would receive any discharge from the planned quarry, was home
to the Tar River Spiny Mussel, a creature whose rarity --
only 12 have been seen in the past four years, and no fertile
ones are known to live outside the creek -- earned it a spot
on the federal Endangered Species list. Second, turbulent
water, such as water roiled by the discharge from a quarry,
is anathema to the mussels, which choke on stirred up
sediment.
   Ms. Smith went public at a routine hearing on the Martin
Marietta application, standing to ask if there would be any
precautions taken at the quarry to protect the two-inch long
mussel.
   "Everyone looked at me like I had lost my mind," she
recalls. "And I wasn't then sure myself why I was so excited
about the mussels that most folks knew squat about."
   She kept up the phone calls, augmenting them with letters
to local politicians and contacts with environmental groups.
Before long, she had earned the sobriquet "mussel woman." Her
efforts weren't without personal cost. Her home phone bill
doubled and she had less time with her 11-year-old daughter
whom she supports with $30,000-a-year commission income
selling vacation cabins for Amerlink, the firm that produces
the prefabricated structures.
   The matter was finally resolved with a compromise. The
state's Department of Environment, Health and Natural
Resources granted Martin Marietta its mining permit but
restricted the rate at which quarry water can be discharged
into Swift Creek and required the company to build holding
ponds at the site. For its part, Martin Marietta is glad the
controversy is over. "It was an accommodation we willingly
made and it will have a minimal impact on our costs and
operations there," says Stephen P. Zelnak Jr., president of
Martin Marietta Aggregates, the quarry operator.
   Ms. Smith is back to selling cabins full time, but she
hasn't forgotten elliptio steinstansana, as the mussel is
known. She has asked the state to declare Swift Creek an
"outstanding" water resource, which under North Carolina law
means that any further development of the stream can't
interfere with its ecology.
