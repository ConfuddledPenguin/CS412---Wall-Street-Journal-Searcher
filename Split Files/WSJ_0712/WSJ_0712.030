   CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said its United Airlines unit
regained the top position among airlines in June for revenue
passenger miles. UAL had lost the No. 1 position to AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines two years ago.
   Most of United's growth is coming from its Pacific routes,
where traffic rose 35.6% in June from a year ago.

   United's June revenue passenger miles increased 8.4%, to
6.91 billion, from 6.37 billion a year earlier. A revenue
passenger mile is the revenue from one passenger flown one
mile.
   American still isn't far behind United. American said its
June revenue passenger miles were 6.86 billion, compared with
6.88 billion last year, down 0.3%. An American spokesman
attributed the decline to a drop in traffic on American's
routes in the Caribbean and Mexico.
   American recently started serving several countries in
Latin America, which should increase its passenger traffic in
the coming months.
