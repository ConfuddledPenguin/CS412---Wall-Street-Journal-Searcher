   Abbott Laboratories said it has introduced a new male
urine test for detecting chlamydia, the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the U.S. The test received Federal
Drug Administration approval a few weeks ago.
   Previously, urethral swabs were used for chlamydia testing
in men. Because those tests were more difficult to perform
and more painful, relatively few at risk sought testing, the
company said.

   Abbott, a health-care products maker based in Abbott Park,
Ill., said the tests are important because chlamydia is
asymptomatic in up to 50% of men and 70% of women infected.
   The company said the world-wide market for chlamydia tests
is about $70 million to $80 million in annual sales, with the
U.S. accounting for 60%. Testing is expected to increase
about 50% now that the new test is available. Abbott, the
only U.S. company currently marketing the urine test,
believes that it could boost annual sales to as much as $120
million.
   If chlamydia is detected early enough, Abbott said,
antibiotics are more than 95% effective in treating the
infection.
