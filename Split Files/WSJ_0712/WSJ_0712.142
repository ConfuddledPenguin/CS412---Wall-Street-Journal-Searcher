   NEW YORK -- Returns on capital for the 46 specialist firms
at the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter dropped
to a 4.4% annual rate after taxes, the Big Board said.
   Specialists are firms that use their own capital to ensure
an orderly market in certain assigned stocks for which they
are responsible. Their job is to facilitate speedy trading,
stepping in to buy shares when too many sell orders pile up
and selling some when investors rush to buy.

   First-quarter returns were down from an 8.6% annualized
rate in the first quarter of 1989, but better than the
negative 1.7% return posted for the fourth quarter.
   The exchange said specialists' profits amounted to $9
million after taxes in the first quarter, down 57% from $21
million in the year-earlier period.
   Meanwhile, the Big Board confirmed industry projections
that its 342 member brokerage firms that deal with the public
had a $486 million pretax loss in the first quarter, compared
with a $200 million pretax profit a year earlier. The loss
reflects $459 million in one-time retrenchment expenses at
certain member broker-dealers, including Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   The exchange said about 59% of the 342 firms reporting for
the quarter were profitable.
   Member brokerage firms' expenses for the quarter rose 2.5%
to $14 billion, their fourth-highest level ever. Revenue fell
2.5% to $13.52 billion, their seventh-highest level.
