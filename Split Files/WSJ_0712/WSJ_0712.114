   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators canceled a session
planned for today amid indications that the parties are
searching for a way to finally begin discussing the delicate
issue of which taxes to raise.
   Taxes have been conspicuously absent from the summit
discussions so far, and negotiators say they must begin
talking specifics soon if they are to have any hope of
reaching a fiscal 1991 deficit-reduction accord this summer.

   Staffers said today's session was canceled to allow
smaller private meetings among key players, who would discuss
not only taxes but also the best way to move the talks
forward. "This is supposed to be a sign of progress," said a
senior Republican aide. "After a while, you've got to get out
of the room and get some work done."
   "We need to see if we can't direct proposals into some
channel that will speed our effort," said Sen. Wyche Fowler
(D., Ga.).
   Outside the summit, Democratic and Republican maneuvering
on taxes is intensifying. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) told reporters yesterday that he won't
go along with a cut in the capital-gains tax unless the
marginal income-tax rate for the richest taxpayers is raised
to 33% from 28%.
   A group of moderate Democrats held a news conference just
outside the summit meeting to demand that any tax increases
be borne by the wealthy, not the middle class. "We can't let
Bush begin the '90s by raising taxes on the middle class,"
said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.). The statement drew an
angry response inside the summit from White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, according to participants.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Richard Armey (R. Texas) won permission
from House Republican leaders to put an anti-tax resolution
to a vote by the Republican rank-and-file next Wednesday. The
resolution opposes "new taxes and all tax rate increases,"
wording intended to cover not only income-tax increases but
higher federal taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Oregon Sen.
Robert Packwood, the senior Republican on the Finance
Committee, told reporters that "Republicans still need to
agree amongst themselves" on taxes.
   Budget negotiators devoted yesterday's session to
reviewing proposals for money-saving changes to government
benefit programs. Republicans are insisting that the summit
produce at least $10 billion in savings from such programs in
the fiscal year starting Oct 1. Participants said yesterday's
discussion made abundantly clear that achieving that goal
will require politically unpalatable moves such as charging
the elderly more for Medicare or trimming Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury said it will run out of cash in
mid-August unless Congress lifts the current $3.123 trillion
ceiling on federal borrowing. Treasury Undersecretary Robert
Glauber asked that the House Ways and Means Committee
consider increasing the limit to $4.053 trillion, high enough
to cover borrowing expected through fiscal 1993.
   Because an increase in the debt ceiling is considered a
must-pass bill, it often attracts unrelated and controversial
amendments. With budget talks under way, the Ways and Means
Committee is likely to approve increasing the ceiling to
permit borrowing for a few months. The ceiling then would
have to be raised again this fall, presumably after the
budget talks are completed.
