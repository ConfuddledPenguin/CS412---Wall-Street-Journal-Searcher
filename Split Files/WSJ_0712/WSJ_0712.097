   Inmac Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., in an effort to stem
operating costs, said it will reduce its work force at the
company's San Jose, Calif., plant by 73 workers, about 60% of
its work force, effective Aug. 31.
   Inmac, which makes a variety of products for use with
computers,, has more than 1,300 employees in nine countries.

   The San Jose plant, the company's only U.S.-based
manufacturing site, will be kept open and used as the
company's product testing center, with jobs for about 50 of
its 120 employees, said a company spokesman. Three vice
president positions have also been eliminated and their
responsibilities combined into one position.
   The reorganization will cost the company about $500,000,
or three cents a share, charged to its operating costs for
its fiscal fourth-quarter, ending July 28.
   The company said it made the move because increased
manufacturing capabilities at facilities in East Kilbridle,
Scotland, and Tijuana, Mexico, along with outside vendors can
adequately supply the company production needs.
