   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.,
citing soft market conditions, said it will temporarily close
its biggest pulp mill for for the third time since March.
   MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest forest
products concern, said the planned two-week shutdown of its
Harmac pulp mill, near Nanaimo, British Columbia, will begin
Aug. 27 and will reduce its inventories of bleached pulp by
about 16,000 metric tons. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.

   Last year, the mill produced 370,000 metric tons of market
pulp, or about 75% of MacMillan Bloedel's total market pulp
output. Market pulp is wood pulp that is sold on the open
market to producers of paper and other products.
   The shutdown will affect about 600 of Harmac's 1,300
employees, the company said, and it is encouraging workers to
take their annual paid vacation during the closure.
   MacMillan Bloedel is 49.9%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda
Forest Inc., itself a unit of the Toronto resource giant
Noranda Inc.
