   Entrepreneurs eager to take on a highly entrenched
competitor might look at the cable TV business in Sacramento,
Calif.
   Several years ago, two businessmen there tried and failed
to get permission from local government to build a system to
compete with the officially anointed cable operator. So they
went to court, and the lawsuits flew. As one local regulator
put it, Sacramento became "the cable-television litigation
capital of the world."

   The two entrepreneurs now have their competing system
running, though with unexpected twists. For one thing, they
survived partly by switching technology. Today, their system
has very little cable; it relies, instead, on an over-the-air
microwave transmission system known as "wireless cable." And
local government, which fought so hard to keep them out, is
now cheering the entrepreneurs on.
   With much of the nation wired for cable television and
major markets dominated by media giants, the cable industry
would hardly seem to be a place for would-be entrepreneurs to
play. Yet as the Sacramento example illustrates, evolving
technology and changing attitudes by local governments may be
making the cable business a more hospitable and lucrative
place for the little guy to compete.
   Traditionally, local governments have given out exclusive
franchises to individual cable companies and fought fiercely
to protect those monopolies from would-be competitors.
Defenders of this approach argue that cable television, like
utility service, is a natural monopoly with capital costs too
great to support more than one system. They note that in a
number of competitive situations where a second cable system
was actually built, one company ended up buying the other.
   But local government support for competition in the cable
industry is growing, partly because of dissatisfaction with
rising prices and poor service. In Huntsville, Ala., for
instance, competition between two cable companies has driven
down the price for some program services to half of what is
being charged in surrounding communities and in some cases
below the wholesale cost of the service itself, says William
G. Jackson, president of Cable America Corp, one of the
competitors. As a result, adds Mr. Jackson, "we are getting
invited into a lot of other cities."
   By contrast, when Sacramento real-estate developers Joseph
Benvenuti and D. Bruce Fite formed Pacific West Cable in the
early 1980s, local government officials did all they could to
invite the two entrepreneurs out of the cable business. The
city and county gave an exclusive franchise to Sacramento
Cable Television Co., which is a subsidiary of
Cincinnati-based media giant E.W. Scripps Co.
   Up to 5% of Sacramento Cable is owned by several dozen
prominent local citizens, who each put up $2,000 for shares
that are worth many times that today, says Richard Esposto,
executive director of the Sacramento Metropolitan Cable
Television Commission, the local regulatory body. Giving
ownership chunks of a franchise for little or no money to
politically powerful local citizens has been a common
practice in the cable industry.
   Cable companies have often paid governments dearly for
exclusive franchises, which in recent years have also been
largely free of rate regulation. Besides annual franchise
fees, Sacramento Cable promised to financially support public
access channels to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a
month. (It didn't have to keep the promise after competitors
were let in.)
   From the beginning, Pacific West refused to make such
offers, says Pacific West's chairman, James Kirschman. "We
felt the city was just using the franchise system to get
companies to pay for things they didn't have money for," he
says.
   After its application was turned down in 1983, Pacific
West filed suit in federal court in Sacramento, claiming,
among other things, that local government was abridging its
free-speech rights. In 1987, a jury agreed and found that the
government's arguments in favor of just one cable operator
were a "sham" designed to increase payments to local
government and campaign contributions to local politicians.
   After that, Pacific West was given a license to start
building a competing system, as was Cable America, which had
also filed an application. Then new problems started.
   Both companies say that as soon as they started installing
their cables, Sacramento Cable began cutting prices in those
areas, while maintaining them elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, the
Cable America president, recalls talking to one customer who
had just signed up for free service from Sacramento Cable.
"He said he would take free service from us, too, and then
cancel the first company that sent him a bill," recalls Mr.
Jackson.
   Cable America eventually sold its Sacramento system to the
Scripps subsidiary. "We couldn't compete," Mr. Jackson says.
   Pacific West says it couldn't compete either. In 1988 it
filed a suit, still pending, in Sacramento federal court that
charges Sacramento Cable with "predatory pricing." Besides
low prices, Sacramento Cable offered such sign-up inducements
as free television sets, says Pacific West's Mr. Kirschman.
   John Moorhead, an attorney for Sacramento Cable, says that
like other businesses his client has a right to set
competitive prices. He adds that all of Sacramento Cable's
pricing actions have been "fair and equitable" and that the
company plans to vigorously defend itself against the Pacific
West lawsuit. He says that at most a handful of free
television sets were offered.
   Besides going back to court, Pacific West turned to a
different technology by merging last year with an
Illinois-based wireless cable company. With wireless cable,
Pacific West simply puts up a small antenna at the customer's
home.
   Though Pacific West's customer base of 5,000 subscribers
is still dwarfed by the 180,000 signed up with Sacramento
Cable, Pacific West is beginning to have an impact, says Mr.
Esposto, the cable commission chairman. Consumers are using
the threat of switching cable companies to get better service
and prices, he says. "Pacific West has gone from being a foe
to a friend. Its presence has been very, very useful."
