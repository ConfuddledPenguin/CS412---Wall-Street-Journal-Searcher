   Newspaper headlines and the evening news told daily
stories of extraordinary events as my wife and I drove south
toward home not long ago. Nelson Mandela strode triumphantly
across the United States. In Europe, where the train of
change is picking up speed at an almost geometrical rate,
NATO was refashioning itself and the Communist Party in the
Soviet Union was staring glumly at the results of its refusal
to do so.
   Along the way from northern Virginia to New Orleans, the
interstate highways took us through and around metropolitan
areas that are visible reminders of why Virginia, North
Carolina, Georgia and Florida will be gaining more
representation in Congress after the census figures come in.
There's no more need to predict a "New South" in those
places. The old debates are irrelevant, overtaken by events.
In virtually every way that matters, for good and for bad,
these are American centers of thriving commerce and industry
now, not idiosyncratic provincial curiosities. A stranger led
blindfolded into Charlotte, N.C., and then set free would be
hard pressed to say whether he was in the North, South, East
or West. What he would know was that he was in the middle of
a prosperous, attractive city where a person could make and
live a good life.

   But the view from the interstates is, like the view of
Europe on the evening news, misleading. There is more to the
"New South" than what the Piedmont around Charlotte might
suggest, just as there is more to the prognosis for central
Europe than Vaclav Havel's prophetic moral grandeur, more to
the possibilities for peaceful transition in South Africa
than Mr. Mandela's resolute courage. We do not live in a
fairy-tale world, in which everyone lives happily ever after.
Nor is human behavior akin to a chemical reaction in which a
radically new thing is instantaneously produced from
combining disparate elements. Away from the interstates lie
complexity, difficulty, intractable legacies of the past and,
frequently, despair.
   All of which struck me with particular force when I
decided to take a one-day drive through my old home area, the
Mississippi-Yazoo Delta, after we had stopped in Jackson to
see our newest grandchild. It was a familiar drive, one I
must have taken hundreds of times before moving to Washington
in 1977, but it was a new experience just the same. For one
thing, many of the communities through which it was once
necessary to navigate are now bypassed, so that it is
possible to drive for seemingly endless miles through the
flat fields without actually seeing many buildings or people.
It is an eerie experience, particularly for the returning
native. It may help explain why so many still wave as they
pass by.
   For another, 13 years is 13 years, and memory plays
tricks. Which is why I decided that sticking to the highways,
none of which are interstates in the Delta, wasn't the way to
go. Attempting to recapture the past along the roads from
Jackson to Greenville, my hometown, I left the main
thoroughfares wherever possible and went into the towns and
hamlets sprinkled along U.S. Highways 49 and 61 and State
Highway 1. The names were familiar. Many of the sights were
not.
   It would not be true to say that what I saw there shocked
me, at least not intellectually. The Delta has always been a
place of immense poverty topped by a sprinkling of affluence.
What is more, much has been written recently about the
depressed state of the area's economy.
   It was profoundly depressing nonetheless. The picture was
almost unrelievedly dismal. What were small towns to begin
with are now nearly ghost towns, many of the old one- and
two-story commercial buildings on their main streets boarded
up and little activity of any kind to be seen. If there is
growth in any of their futures, if in the most literal sense
they have a future, it is hard to know how and from what
source. The region is one of the nation's poorest, its people
-- predominantly black -- among the nation's least educated,
its economy still tied to agricultural staples requiring
large-scale cultivation and heavy mechanization.
   The larger towns, such as Greenville and Greenwood,
obviously aren't going away, and there are signs of hope in
several other places as well, but overall this is a place
that makes a mockery of the concept of Sunbelt prosperity. A
new commission was recently created to study the multistate
Delta region's problems and recommend solutions, which is a
fine idea but hardly a new one. Its recommendations probably
won't be new either. Among the obvious, vastly improved
public education, diversified industry, better use of the
fertile land, a public welfare and health system that
actually reaches the needy.
   All of which would cost large sums of money, and money is
not something Mississippi has in large supply. Whether and
how to tap what it does have is an issue that has sharply
divided its aggressive governor, Ray Mabus, and a legislature
itself divided between Old Guard and New. The result recently
was legislative stalemate, at least temporarily blocking his
ambitious educational-reform program.
   But Mississippi and its Delta, while poor, are not unique
in the South. Rural poverty is the nation's worst poverty,
and the South even now ranks only behind the Rocky Mountain
States when it comes to the percentage of people living in
rural areas. The result is that there is not a single
Southern state that does not have pockets of severe
deprivation, reminders of the region-wide South that once
was. Just the other day, the New York Times rediscovered
eastern North Carolina's economic distress and the state's
split personality along class lines when it comes to the
delivery of education, health and housing. Louisiana, whose
legislature has spent several months trying to be as
retrograde as the ones that once fashioned massive resistance
to desegregation, is still in an economic black hole. New
Orleans, "the city care forgot," is a city that prosperity
long since abandoned.
   Get off the beaten track almost anywhere in the region and
you find the same thing. The communities you encounter are
clearly going nowhere. Life is a marginal experience for
many, if not most of their inhabitants. It's the way the
South once was for virtually everyone, back before World War
II. It's a reality that has nothing to do with the booming
South of tourist brochures and urban glitter.
   None of this is written to cause unhappiness or anger back
home, but as a reminder of unfinished business. There is a
temptation, which for most of the 1980s became policy in
Washington, to pretend that none of the old domestic problems
exist. Just as wildly premature triumphalism in the wake of
communism's collapse has led some Americans to advocate
withdrawal from overseas commitments, uneven prosperity and
"New South" imagery have led others to write off any sense of
obligation to the places and people left behind. But they
still exist, victims of forces over which they have little or
no control as surely as Americans were once victims of the
Great Depression. As with the central Europeans, there is
much that the people on the ground must do for themselves. As
with central Europe, few of the most critically depressed
areas have enough resources or expertise to do it alone.
