   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf
registration covering $700 million of senior or subordinated
debt securities and warrants to purchase senior or
subordinated debt securities.
   The securities may be offered from time to time directly
by the bank holding company or through underwriters including
Salomon Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and
others, at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to
be determined at the time of offering.
</LP>

   Proceeds of the proposed sale of the securities will be
used for general corporate purposes, mainly to extend credit
to, or fund investments in the company's subsidiaries.
   A spokesman said the concern last filed a similar shelf
registration of $1 billion in June, 1988, and that amount has
subsequently been issued.
