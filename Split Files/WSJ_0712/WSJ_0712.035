   You'll always stay young
   If you get ample rest;
   Good eating habits
   Will add vigor and zest.
   Live in moderation,
   Don't give vent to rage;
   Exercise faithfully,
   Then lie about your age.
   -- Gail Cooke.

   Prophetic Graffiti
                                                                                                       

   It was all spelled out in spray paint
   For years before its fall,
   So it's odd the dictators didn't heed
   That handwriting on the Wall.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
