   HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said it named former federal
energy regulator Martha O. Hesse to the board of its
natural-gas pipeline unit.
   Ms. Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission from October 1986 until November 1989, is now a
senior vice president of First Chicago Corp., a banking
concern. During her stint at FERC, the agency overhauled the
naturalgas and electric industries in an attempt to lessen
regulation.

Energy and Commerce departments and with the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget. In Chicago, she was a co-founder and
chief operating officer of SEI Information Technology, a
dataprocessing consulting concern.
   She was named to the board of Coastal's American Natural
Resources Co. unit, which includes the ANR Pipeline Co. Her
appointment increases the unit's board to ten members.
