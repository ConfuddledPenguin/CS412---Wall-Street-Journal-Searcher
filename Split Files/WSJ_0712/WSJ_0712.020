   NEW YORK -- Investors pushed stock prices sharply and
broadly higher, inspired by positive second-quarter earnings
reports and bullish news for oil stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 41.83 points to
2932.67 in active trading, coming within a few points of the
record set June 15. Bond prices were essentially unchanged.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the German mark
after Tuesday's sharp declines.

   Traders said investors welcomed relatively positive
earnings announcements for big stocks. Favorable earnings
news from Motorola, which rose 7/8 to 86 3/8, helped spark
interest in other technology issues.
   Intel advanced 1 3/4 to 48, for example.
   Also helping to lift stock prices were strong earnings
reports from such companies as Federal National Mortgage
Association and Walgreen, along with positive analysts'
recommendations for stocks such as Humana. Finally, late in
the day, the market surge was extended by a wave of
futures-related program buying-purchases of baskets of stocks
with offsetting sales of futures contracts.
   "People are gaining confidence that the second quarter
wasn't a disaster," said money manager James Awad, president
of BMI Capital. Also boosting the stock market, he said, was
the successful completion Tuesday of a sale of
savings-and-loan bailout bonds.
   Abby Joseph Cohen, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Research, said investors should continue to be
pleasantly surprised by earnings for the just-ended quarter,
noting that the level of write-offs by corporations should be
lower than in the first quarter. While she thinks that
earnings disappointments probably will hurt the market later
this year, that danger doesn't exist yet, she said.
   But right now, Ms. Cohen said, to achieve the consensus of
analysts' earnings estimates for the year on the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 Stock Index, corporate profits would have to jump
roughly 40% in the third and fourth quarters. "For that to
happen, we'd have to be in a robust economy, and that's not
the case," she said.
   Indeed, investors remain poised to punish stocks that
deliver bad profit reports.
   "The dark side of the whole picture is that if there is an
earnings disappointment, the stocks hit air pockets and down
they go," said Holly Stark, head of trading at Dalton,
Greiner, Hartman, Maher &amp; Co. Among stocks that fell on
earnings news were Hilton Hotels, down 1 1/2 to 51 1/2, and
Oracle Systems, which fell 2 1/2 to 19 7/8 on 9.4 million
shares.
   Some analysts said the stock market's broad move upward
supports the notion that investors are continuing to focus
attention on earnings and not on interest rates. In this
regard, the gain was encouraging, analysts said, because it
came in the absence of such artificial influences as
end-of-the-quarter portfolio window-dressing.
   A sign that institutions were more active is that trading
in large blocks of stock picked up. On the New York Stock
Exchange, 3,529 blocks of 10,000 shares or more traded,
compared with 3,013 the day before.
   The oil stocks added a boost to the market, rising on news
that suggested oil prices would continue to firm with the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries showing some
resolve to bolster prices. Also, there was a report that
crudeoil inventories are declining more sharply than
expected.
   Another positive influence on stock prices was the
peaceful conclusion of the economic summit in Houston, said
Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics.
   "It ended with the group making the same wonderful, very
anticipated points, all positive," Mr. Fabbri said, "so there
was no feeling of contention."
   Despite the rally, William Kufta, senior vice president at
Pitcairn Financial Management, said, "We would not go fully
invested at this point." He said inflation is still too high
to allow the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which
he said is needed to get stocks higher.
   As a hedge against inflation, Pitcairn has 18% of its $1
billion stock portfolio dedicated to energy stocks, Mr. Kufta
said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices soared in active trading. Volume was 162.2
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing
issues outnumbered decliners, 971 to 506.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were unchanged. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.56%.
   The dollar rose.
                                                                                                       

   In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at
1.6560 marks and 148.50 yen, up from 1.6425 marks and 148.30
yen Tuesday.

   ABBY JOSEPH COHEN, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Research, said analysts' profit estimates for 1991 on
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index can't be achieved
without 40% growth during the intervening six quarters. An
earlier edition misstated the year she was discussing.
