   Suedzucker AG of West Germany, a sugar company, said
profit for the year ended Feb. 28 rose 48% to 86.2 million
marks ($52.4 million), or 40 marks a share, from 58.2 million
marks, or 28.20 marks a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 33% to 3.6 billion marks from 2.7 billion
marks. Suedzucker said its 1.35 billion-mark acquisition of
the Belgian sugar company Raffinerie Tirlemontois S.A. last
year, which made Suedzucker Europe's largest sugar producer,
boosted sales in the last five months of fiscal 1990.

   The company plans to raise its dividend 27% to 14 marks a
share from 11 marks.
   Analysts had criticized the high price paid for
Tirlemontois, saying Suedzucker was primarily interested in
acquiring the company's sugar production quotas. Each
European Community country has a production quota, and the EC
support price is well above the market level. Last November,
Suedzucker officials conceded the price was high, citing the
quotas. The company will eventually lower its holding in
wholly owned Tirlemontois to about 60%.
