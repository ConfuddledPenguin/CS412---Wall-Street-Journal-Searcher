   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's lower house of Congress approved
286-28 and sent to the Senate a bill that would allow
foreigners to own interests of as much as 30% in 18
commercial banks that are to be privatized.
   Only Mexican individual investors and financial holding
companies could hold Series A stock, making up at least 51%
of each bank's shares outstanding. Mexican corporations,
institutional investment funds, individuals and financial
holding companies could own Series B shares, limited to 49%.
Foreigners would be eligible to hold Series C stock, with a
30% limit.

   The bill also limits individual investors' holdings to 5%
of each bank in most cases; stakes of as much as 10% would be
allowed with special government consent.
