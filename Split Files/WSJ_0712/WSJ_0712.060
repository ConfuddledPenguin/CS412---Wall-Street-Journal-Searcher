   SYDNEY, Australia -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said
yesterday that its Harper-Collins Publishers Inc. unit has
agreed to buy British-based book publisher Unwin Hyman Ltd.
   News Corp. didn't reveal the price of the transaction in a
statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, but it said Unwin
Hyman's group annual sales exceeded #15 million ($27.3
million) in 1989, and is split evenly between the U.K. and
overseas.

<TEXT>
   Unwin Hyman's Australian and New Zealand units aren't
included in the transaction, but the U.S. unit, Unwin Hyman
Inc. of Boston, will become part of Harper-Collins North
America.
   In the U.K., Unwin Hyman's books include trade, education
and academic topics.
