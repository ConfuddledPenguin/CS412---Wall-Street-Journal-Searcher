   PONTIAC, Mich. -- Perry Drug Stores Inc. expects its
fiscal 1991 sales to range from $720 million to $730 million
as a result of an agreement to buy 40 former Revco stores,
Jack A. Robinson, chairman, said. Perry's 1990 fiscal year
ends Oct. 31. The company's fiscal 1989 sales of $670 million
included revenue from the A.L. Price division, which Perry
sold May 30. Mr. Robinson, speaking to analysts and portfolio
managers, also said he expects Perry's rate of profitability
to exceed the percentage increase in sales for fiscal 1991.
