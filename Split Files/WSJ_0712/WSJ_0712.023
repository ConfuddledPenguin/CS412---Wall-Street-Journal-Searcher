   TOKYO -- Japan's economy will enter into a period of
gradual slowdown, but it will still expand at a respectable
4.1% pace in fiscal 1990 after inflation is taken into
account, a think tank predicted.
   Mitsubishi Research Institute said the Japanese economy,
following sustained expansion, will move on a "plateau" in
the fiscal year that began in April.

   Nevertheless, it said, personal consumption will go up
4.0% with the help of income growth and will underpin the
economy despite a lower rate of increase in corporate capital
spending and housing investment.
   Japan's economy has been expanding for 43 consecutive
months through June, the second longest postwar period of
expansion.
   In fiscal 1990, Mitsubishi said, wholesale prices will
edge up 1.7% and consumer prices 2.5%, and the Bank of Japan
will maintain a tight credit stance. However, the research
institute said, the central bank is unlikely to raise the
official discount rate during this fiscal year from its
present level of 5.25%.
   "As long as oil prices and other overseas conditions don't
show drastic changes," it said, "inflation, a source of most
serious concern in the process of economic growth in fiscal
1990 and 1991, won't worsen to the point where it could
seriously impede growth."
