   The Federal National Mortgage Association's net income
increased 50% in the second quarter, to $289.6 million, or
$1.10 per share, from $193 million, or 75 cents per share, a
year ago.
   In the first six months, net was $566.2 million, or $2.15
a share, compared with $358.2 million, or $1.39 a share, a
year earlier.

   Roger Birk, Fannie Mae president and chief operating
officer, attributed the second quarter gain to a $2.1 billion
increase in the average investment balance, an increase of
four basis points in the net interest margin and growth of
$8.3 million in mortgage-backed security guaranty fees.
   Mr. Birk also said the government-sponsored agency
acquired 2,315 properties through foreclosure in the second
quarter, down from 2,455 a year ago. At the same time,
charge-offs to Fannie Mae's allowance for loan losses were
$59.4 million, virtually unchanged from $59.1 million in the
first quarter of 1990 and down from $71.4 million a year ago.
