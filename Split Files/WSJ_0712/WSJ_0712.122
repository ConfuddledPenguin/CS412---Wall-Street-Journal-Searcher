   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
a $20.7 billion Treasury and Postal Service spending bill
that would increase Internal Revenue Service funding by 11.5%
in fiscal 1991 and mandate stepped-up tax enforcement against
foreign-owned U.S. companies.
   More than $6.13 billion would be provided for the IRS in
the new budget year beginning Oct. 1. By a 19-12 margin, the
committee approved language requiring the agency to use at
least $10 million of the new money to crack down on
foreign-owned businesses.

   The added money represents an increase of more than 25%
from current expenditures for such tax compliance cases,
according to Treasury estimates cited by the chief sponsor,
Rep. Frank Wolf (R., Va.). It comes amid increased pressure
to strengthen IRS enforcement powers as well. House Ways and
Means Committee investigators testified this week that their
own inquiry found a pattern of foreign-owned subsidiaries
often paying little or no U.S. taxes. The amendment yesterday
drew support from both conservatives and liberals.
   The action came as a House appropriations subcommittee
separately approved an estimated $8.3 billion military
construction bill, making deep cuts from the Pentagon's
requests for overseas facilities and freezing any new U.S.
obligations for the Air Force's costly new NATO base in
Crotone, Italy.
   Funding for NATO infrastructure accounts would be cut to
an estimated $250 million, or $170.4 million below the
administration's request. The freeze on funds for Crotone
would run through Dec. 31 to allow time for the House and
Senate Armed Services Committees to decide on the future of
the facility, which is intended to serve 72 F-16s in southern
Italy. Gen. John Galvin, chief of allied forces in Europe,
lobbied for the money in telephone calls to senior members,
and though Republicans agreed that the current plans are in
jeopardy, the final provision represents at least a tactical
victory for the military, which avoided an outright
termination of funds.
   More broadly, Pentagon requests for foreign facilities
were cut by more than half. And while lawmakers maneuvered to
protect favored projects at home, all of an estimated $254
million for three MX missile sites and two depots was
deferred, including funding for one base in the home district
of House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington.
   The $20.7 billion bill yesterday is the sixth of the 13
annual appropriations measures to clear the full committee,
which is expected to act today on legislation allocating an
estimated $170.4 billion for the Departments of Labor,
Education, and Health and Human Services. This massive bill
includes billions of dollars in funding increases for public
schools and health research, but after a period of rapid
growth, the ambitious program within the National Institutes
of Health to map the human gene would receive $66.1 million,
or just two-thirds of the administration's request.
   James Watson, the Nobel Prize winner who is director of
the Center for Human Genome Research at NIH, had lobbied
aggressively for a larger increase, but within the scientific
community there remain divisions over the merits and design
of the costly program. In this light, the committee proposal
appears designed to slow the growth of the project until the
appointment of a new NIH director this summer. Though few
expect full funding of the administration's request,
appropriations could be restored then after a re-evaluation
of the program.
   The ambitious goals -- and costs -- of the gene-mapping
project contrast with the more mundane and parochial
provisions attached to yesterday's bill. Soybean interests
succeeded in specifying that the Bureau of Engraving must
design a test of inks based on soybean oil. And within the
"federal buildings fund" the bill adds more than $43 million
to the president's budget for an assortment of hospital,
university, and social-service grants for projects that are
neither federal nor, in some cases, even buildings. "The
rationale?" said Rep. Edward Roybal (D., Calif.), the
subcommittee chairman. "The rationale is, your colleagues ask
you to do it."
   Elsewhere, Postal Service subsidies would grow by 6.8% to
$484.6 million. Almost $330 million would be provided for the
White House's own operations, including an 11.2% increase for
the Office of Management and Budget -- one of the fastest
growing accounts. Apart from the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms within the Treasury would receive a
significant increase. The bill adds $21 million to the
department's request to fund a program targeted at tracking
and apprehending armed career criminals.
