   MILAN, Italy -- The financier Carlo De Benedetti regained
operating control of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., when
several of his aides and allies were appointed to pivotal
management positions at the company, Italy's largest
publisher.
   At the end of a five-hour board meeting, Mr. De
Benedetti's chief aide, Corrado Passera, was appointed
general manager of Mondadori. Mr. Passera said he will step
down as general manager of Mr. De Benedetti's Cie.
Industriale Riunite S.p.A.

   Carlo Caracciolo, former president of Mondadori before he
was unseated temporarily by the television entrepeneur Silvio
Berlusconi, was appointed managing director.
   The new appointments sealed Mr. De Benedetti's recovery,
after a fierce eight-month battle with Mr. Berlusconi that
traversed courtroom and boardroom. Mr. Berlusconi was
unseated as Mondadori's chairman on June 29, and shareholders
appointed Giacinto Spizzico, a representative of the Milan
district court, to the post.
   Yet there are still no signs of a negotiated settlement
between Messrs. De Benedetti and Berlusconi, which most
analysts maintain is essential for a lasting resolution of
their conflict. Mr. Berlusconi still controls significant
stakes in both Mondadori and its parent company, AME
Finanziaria S.p.A. Without an accord, management of Mondadori
could still be troubled, analysts said.
