   MEXICO CITY -- A bid to privatize Mexico's largest mine,
Cia. Minera de Cananea S.A., has fallen apart for the third
time in the past three years.
   A Superior Court judge rejected a $468 million bid by the
Mexican construction concern Grupo ICA S.A. and its Canadian
and West German partners. The court and Grupo ICA differed on
whether the bidders would have to pay the Mexican sales tax
on the transaction, which would have added about $70 million
to the price.

   The government will open bidding again next month for the
copper mine, which is near the Arizona border.
   One previous effort to sell the mine failed when a
purchasing group's financing package collapsed, and another
failed when bids were rejected by the government as too low.
   The mine has been the center of political and labor
strife.
