   Last year Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley shamed his
colleagues into amending the Americans With Disabilities Act
so they would be covered by the same anti-discrimination
rules binding business. On Tuesday, the Senators retreated
into hypocrisy as usual when they voted 63 to 26 to amend the
ADA conference report to once again exempt the Senate. The
same vote also exempted them from full coverage of the Civil
Rights Bill. GOP Senator Warren Rudman claimed there was
already a brief in-house rule that simply asks Members not to
discriminate. Senator Grassley noted this doesn't give Senate
employees recourse to the courts. "If a 150-word rule is good
enough for us," he asked, "why don't we repeal the hundreds
of pages of civil-rights law and make do with a simple rule?"
No one replied, but by their action the Senators have shown
they can't be bothered to live by the same rules they force
the rest of us to follow.
