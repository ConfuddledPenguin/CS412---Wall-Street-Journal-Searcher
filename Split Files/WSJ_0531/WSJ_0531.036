   Chrysler Corp. will reduce the cash it offers consumers on
at least three of its car lines, when it renews its buyer
incentive program this week.
   A spokesman confirmed that the Highland Park, Mich., auto
maker will reduce to $750 from $1,000 the rebate to buyers of
its Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance compact cars; its
Chrysler LeBaron line; and its Dodge Spirit and Plymouth
Acclaim midsized cars.

   Chrysler officials attributed the reduced incentives to
stronger sales and lower stocks of the cars. Sales of the
Spirit and Acclaim vehicles this year through May 20 rose 34%
from a year earlier, Chrysler said. Inventories of the cars
represent about a 50-day supply, relatively low for the
industry. Chrysler said its aggressive sales campaign, which
compares the cars directly to those built by Japan-based auto
makers, has helped boost sales.
   Chrysler isn't the only auto maker to cut incentives
recently. Ford Motor Co. this month reduced its cash
incentives on some of its more popular models.
