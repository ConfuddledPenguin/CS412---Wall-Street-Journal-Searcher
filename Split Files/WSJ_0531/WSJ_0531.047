   MOLINE, Ill. -- Deere &amp; Co. named Chief Executive Officer
Hans W. Becherer to the additional post of chairman.
   Mr. Becherer, 55 years old, succeeds Robert A. Hanson, 65,
who is retiring. Mr. Becherer succeeded Mr. Hanson in the
chief executive post last August.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Becherer, a 28-year veteran at the maker of farm and
industrial equipment, previously also held the title of
president; Deere yesterday named as president and chief
operating officer David H. Stowe Jr. The post of chief
operating officer has been vacant since last August.
   Mr. Stowe, 53, formerly served as the company's executive
vice president, worldwide agricultural equipment and consumer
products. He was succeeded in that position by 56-year-old
Bill C. Harpole, formerly senior vice president, world-wide
parts and logistics.
   Bernard L. Hardiek, 50, formerly Deere's vice president
for business development, planning and taxation, assumed Mr.
Harpole's former posts.
   Mr. Harpole was named a Deere director, as was Crandall C.
Bowles, president of Springs Co., expanding board membership
to 15. Messrs. Stowe and Becherer were already board members,
and Mr. Hanson will remain on the board.
