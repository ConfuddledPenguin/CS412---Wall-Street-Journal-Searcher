   Quantum Corp., a Milpitas, Calif., maker of hard-disk
drives for personal computers, said it has settled a patent
infringement suit that it filed against Western Digital Corp.
in 1988. As part of the agreement, Western Digital, Irvine,
Calif., said it will pay Quantum $4 million.
   The suit charged that certain disk drive products that
Western Digital acquired from Tandon Corp. in 1988 infringed
on patents covering Quantum's wedge-servo architecture and
the popular Hardcard disk drives made by Quantum's
subsidiary, Plus Development Corp.

   Western Digital said it stopped making the contested
drives that use wedge-servo architecture at the end of last
year. It said it agreed, as part of the settlement, to
sharply limit production of its version of Quantum's
Hardcard, which Western Digital calls FileCard, by Jan. 1,
1991.
   A company with a reputation for zealously guarding its
patents, Quantum has successfully waged patent wars against
several rivals. In recent years, it has won $6 million from
Computer Memories Inc. and $3 million from Japan's NEC Corp.
Last year, it escalated a legal feud with Sony Corp., filing
a federal lawsuit that accused the Japanese firm of patent
violations and unfair business practices.
