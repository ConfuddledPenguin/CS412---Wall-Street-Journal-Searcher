   Digital Equipment Corp. outlined strategic alliances with
software makers, consultants and two big accounting firms in
a push into the emerging markets for electronic-forms
processing, automated billing and ordering, and document
management.
   The Maynard, Mass., computer maker said its new products
and alliances would simplify and speed the flow of business
information between and within organizations. Companies would
use the products and services to develop paperless ordering
systems, for example, or to replace mountains of paper
documents with computer-stored images.

   Price Waterhouse, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a handful of
software and telecommunications companies announced
partnerships with Digital to provide electronic data
interchange, document-management consulting and related
services.
   The new products include electronic data interchange
software that Digital says has an edge over competitors
because it may be used across a variety of data networks and
is based on a popular electronicmail standard.
