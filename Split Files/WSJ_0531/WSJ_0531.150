   LA JOLLA, Calif. -- John C. Stiska was elected president
of Intermark Inc. and of its 52%-owned affiliate, Triton
Group Ltd. The executive also was endorsed to be the
companies' next chief executive officer.
   The companies' current chief executive, Charles R. Scott,
said that Mr. Stiska, 48 years old, will be groomed as his
"ultimate successor" after he retires. On June 1, Mr. Scott,
62, will relinquish the president's title and assume the
additional title of Intermark chairman, a vacant post. He is
also Triton chairman.

   Mr. Stiska is an attorney who has acted as special counsel
to Intermark's board of directors for the past 15 years.
Since 1987, he has been a partner in the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison.
   In March, Triton and Intermark announced an agreement to
combine the two holding companies. If the merger is
completed, Triton would become a wholly owned Intermark
subsidiary. The companies anticipate that shareholder
meetings to approve the transaction will be held in July.
   The two companies hold interests in numerous operating
companies in retailing, restaurants, real estate and other
industries.
