   SEOUL -- The South Korean government will limit the supply
of new stocks to 300 billion won ($427.4 million) a month in
a bid to revive the stock market, the Ministry of Finance
said.
   Ministry officials said the government will limit the
issuing of shares by listed companies to 250 billion won a
month and by previously unlisted companies to 50 billion won.
The limits will remain in effect until the stock market
recovers from its current bearishness, they said. The
market's key index has fallen about 14% this year, despite
government measures.

   Financial institutions, which have provided a large amount
of new stocks to the market recently, will be banned from
issuing new shares until market sentiment improves, under the
ruling. Small and midsized companies, which face more
difficulties in raising capital than large corporations, will
be given priority in getting government approval for issuing
new shares.
   Under the ruling, stocks issued this year could total only
about 3.4 trillion won, including 1.3 trillion won to date,
compared with 14.1 trillion won in 1989.
