   American International Group Inc., in an apparent move to
protect itself from potentially large performance-bond
claims, said it is proposing through a subsidiary to acquire
Fischbach Corp. in a merger at $11 a share, or approximately
$44 million.
   American International, a large New York-based insurer, is
responsible for a large portion of the performance bonds for
Fischbach, a troubled electrical and mechanical contracting
concern based in New York. While an American International
spokesman said he couldn't estimate the dollar amount of the
performance bonds issued to Fischbach, the total reportedly
is about $600 million.

   Performance or surety bonds usually guarantee that
construction projects for municipalities and other entities
are completed as promised.
   American International officials weren't available late
yesterday to explain the status of the work guaranteed by
these bonds and how recent these commitments were.
   American International also said it plans to bring in a
construction company to provide management consulting
services to loss-ridden Fischbach as soon as American
International can obtain approval from Fischbach's board.
   In addition, APL Corp., controlled by Miami financier
Victor Posner, said it and American International modified
the terms of American International's previously announced
option to acquire APL's approximately 54% stake in Fischbach
to set a new exercise price of $11 a share.
   APL also said it agreed to recommend approval of the
merger proposal to Fischbach's board, which APL said is
planning to meet next week to consider the matter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Fischbach closed at $9.75, unchanged. Fischbach officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   American International said the proposed merger would be
subject to approval of Fischbach's board and other customary
conditions.
   Mr. Posner couldn't be reached for comment, but he may rue
the day he became involved with Fischbach. He paid far more
for the shares than the $11-a-share option he gave to
American International. And the manner in which he acquired
control has proven to be part of one of Wall Street's most
high-profile scandals.
   According to testimony by Michael Milken, the former
junk-bond king who pleaded guilty last month to six felonies,
one of his misdeeds was forcing an unwilling Fischbach into
the hands of Mr. Posner by having Ivan Boesky take a large
and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.
   Analysts were puzzled by American International's
announcement yesterday. One said that if a contractor can't
complete a job, insurers would typically pay the claims, but
not take over the entire contracting company.
   Another person familiar with Fischbach believes American
International's move is "purely defensive," as the insurer
would probably like to oversee the management of Fischbach as
a way of guarding against possible future claims against its
performance bonds.
   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last
December, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American
International, said the company has been an insurer of
"Posner enterprises for a number of years and with
satisfactory results."
   Mr. Greenberg also said last December that American
International could hold on to Fischbach as an investment or
act "as a facilitator," possibly selling it to another entity
that would be interested in the contracting business.
