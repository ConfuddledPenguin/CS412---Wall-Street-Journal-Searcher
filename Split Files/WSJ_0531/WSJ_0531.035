   Phoenix Technologies Ltd. said 14 personal computer makers
will license its EISA-standard system software, suggesting
new strength for the EISA computer communications standard
over International Business Machines Corp.'s MCA design.
   EISA, which stands for extended industry-standard
architecture, was developed last year by a group of PC makers
led by Compaq Computer Corp. to counter IBM's effort to push
a new standard that wasn't compatible with existing PCs. IBM
says its MCA -- or micro-channel architecture -- design
allows faster data exchange within and among its computers.

   In a statement, Ron Fisher, president and chief executive
officer of the Norwood, Mass., company, said, "We continue to
see a groundswell of development activity on the EISA"
design. Phoenix, which sells system software that allows PC
makers to build IBM-compatible computers, said its EISA
products are made for PCs using Intel Corp. 80386 and 80486
chips.
   Companies licensing the EISA compatibility products from
Phoenix include Intel, NEC Corp., Tandy Corp. and Altos
Computer Systems.
