   PARIS -- A growing battle between the U.S. and the
European Community over agricultural subsidies has
complicated attempts to boost the current round of
trade-liberalization talks, and the feud could torpedo them
completely.
   The struggle has come to a head here at the annual meeting
of the club of 24 rich nations, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The fight pits the U.S., backed
by Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other food
exporters outside the OECD against the European Community.

   "We have hit a snag in our negotiations," White House
Trade Representative Carla Hills told reporters. "It means at
the least that the European Community isn't yet prepared to
deal with {agricultural} export subsidies." Earlier in the
day, Mrs. Hills told ministers that agricultural trade is the
"linchpin" of the current round of world trade talks being
held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC's vice president for external
relations, said the U.S. "has fallen prey to
oversimplification" in insisting that agriculture is so
central to the GATT talks. "Some people wanted to bring
pressure to get back to positions we have given up," said Mr.
Andriessen, a former minister in the Dutch government.
   The squabble centers on how to implement a commitment that
the GATT's 97 member countries made in April 1989 to
negotiate "a substantial progressive reduction" of subsidies
and other policies that distort agricultural trade. The U.S.
and its supporters want to implement that commitment through
negotiations involving four separate aspects of agricultural
trade: market access; internal price supports; export
subsidies; and health and sanitation rules, which sometimes
are used to protect agricultural markets.
   But the 12 nations of the European Community were prepared
this week only to repeat their endorsement of the earlier,
general GATT statement against agriculture subsidies,
according to U.S. and Canadian officials.
   "This is a framework that could be accepted, and would be
accepted, by everyone in the world except the EC," said U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   The EC, whose overall agricultural subsidies are estimated
to cost as much as $125 billion a year, wants to consider all
trade-distorting agricultural policies in the aggregate
rather than looking at specific areas as proposed by the the
U.S. That, according to Washington, would give the Europeans
room to maintain export subsidies while giving some ground in
other areas. The U.S., whose subsidies are estimated to cost
as much as $75 billion a year, seems much more willing to get
rid of such devices.
   The EC's commissioner for agriculture, Ray MacSharry, said
agricultural reform "is a difficult and complex subject to
tackle" and averred that the EC remains committed to "the
path of reform that it initiated several years ago." He said
that since 1986 the EC has cut its overall support for the
arable sector 10%, and its support for the livestock sector
15%.
   Mrs. Hills and Mr. Yeutter said at a news conference that
the dispute over agricultural trade will be left unresolved
in the OECD's annual communique, which is scheduled for
release today. That communique is expected to contain the
respective positions of the two groups of countries without
attempting to reconcile them.
   Some ministers were particularly gloomy about the outcome
of the OECD discussions on agricultural trade. There's "no
reason for optimism from the discussions today," said
Canada's trade minister, John Crosbie, who said the deadlock
over agriculture could threaten the whole round of GATT
negotiations.
   The GATT talks began in 1986 and are due to be completed
by the end of this year. Mr. Yeutter noted that the 97
countries participating in the GATT talks previously agreed
to reach outline accords covering 15 different areas of
trade, including agriculture, by July. A final accord must be
reached by year end to meet U.S. legislative deadlines deemed
essential for the pact's approval by Congress. Because the
U.S. is the world's largest economy and largest exporter, a
trade plan would be doomed by its failure to go along.
   Agricultural protectionism has been growing in recent
years. Mr. Yeutter said protectionism currently adds 40% to
the value of agricultural goods, compared with 21% in the
mid-1960s.
   Some in the EC recognize the benefit of getting rid of
agricultural subsidies, and the U.S. and other nations
clearly hope that dialogue among EC countries in the coming
weeks will produce a greater willingness to compromise.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major argued that
the potential benefits are "huge," saying that by one
estimate liberalizing agricultural protection and subsidies
would save $60 billion in annual government subsidies in
industrial countries and offer developing countries
comparable income gains.
