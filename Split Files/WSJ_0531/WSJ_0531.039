   A Pennsylvania appeals court barred Bell of Pennsylvania's
Caller ID service, saying it violates the state's wiretap law
and constitutional right to privacy.
   In a ruling with nationwide implications, the court
overturned a November decision by the state Public Utilities
Commission that allowed the Bell Atlantic Corp. unit to offer
the service. Caller ID permits customers to identify the
telephone number of incoming calls.

   The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled 5-0 that the
service violates the state wiretap law's provision banning
trap and trace devices and split 3-2 on the issue of
violating privacy rights. The court took a hard line, ruling
that the service was illegal whether or not the phone company
allowed customers to block the transmission of their phone
numbers.
   The company said it was "extremely disappointed" and
indicated it would appeal. "We will carefully study this
ruling before deciding our next action, but a clear option is
to ask for judicial review by the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania," said Bill Harral, vice president, external
affairs, for Bell of Pennsylvania. In banning the service
even if customers were allowed to block their numbers, the
court went beyond what opponents had sought, the company
complained.
   The suit was filed against the commission by the state
Consumer Advocates' office, the Pennsylvania Coalition
Against Domestic Violence, the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.
   "We're gratified, of course," said Daniel Clearfield,
Pennsylvania's senior assistant consumer advocate. "This
affirms consumers' right to control the disclosure of
personal information, a fact that was forgotten by the phone
company."
   In its 23-page ruling, the court said that neither the
device that lets customers see the phone number of people
calling or the information that is collected is "controlled
or maintained by Bell but rather by the customer subscriber,
clearly violating the trap and trace device prohibition."
   The issues raised by the Pennsylvania case are likely to
be repeated as phone companies roll out Caller ID services
across the country. Privacy rights, said Mr. Clearfield, "are
very carefully protected in our society, and once courts
begin to take a hard look at Caller ID, they will see through
the phone company line that the service enhances privacy."
   So far, Bell Atlantic has been the most aggressive of the
seven regional Bell companies in introducing the service,
having begun offering it more than two years ago in New
Jersey. Bell Atlantic units also offer Caller ID service in
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. The company has
promoted Caller ID as a guard against harassing or obscene
calls, and claims that most Caller ID subscribers have
unlisted numbers and want the service to further protect
their privacy.
   A Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman acknowledged that the
ruling "could lead to other states looking at this and
concluding that they need to take a closer look at Caller ID.
But frankly, I don't think this story is completed." Caller
ID proposals have generated intense debate in several states,
including California, Nevada, Ohio, Indiana, and in the
District of Columbia. In California, the issue was resolved
by a new law that allows customers to block the transmission
of their number on a call-by-call basis.
   Bell of Pennsylvania has been providing Caller ID in
Pennsylvania on a limited basis to police and ambulance
services as a cheaper alternative to 911 service, a spokesman
said. The company's plan to offer it to customers in
Philadelphia and Harrisburg was blocked until the case was
decided.
   The issue has made its way to Congress, where Sen. Herbert
Kohl (D., Wis.) is pushing a bill that would require phone
companies to block the transmission of numbers at customers'
request. The bill is scheduled for a committee markup next
week.
   Among consumer advocates and privacy experts, the court
decision was viewed as an important first step. They worry
that Caller ID violates callers' expectations that their
number is private. Many contend the service could increase
telemarketing and other sales calls and threatens the
effectiveness of hotlines, tip lines for law enforcement
agencies, shelters for battered women and other community
services that depend on maintaining a caller's anonymity.
   "The state court reaffirmed a central principle that the
phone subscriber -- not the phone company -- should decide
when to disclose phone numbers," said Marc Rotenberg, head of
the Washington office of Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility.
