   Speaking recently to analysts in New York, Thomas
Stephens, the chief executive of Manville Corp., tried to
interest them in its "quality businesses and strong
competitive positions." But when it came time for questions,
the analysts seemed mainly interested in "the Trust."
   More than a year after emerging from bankruptcy
proceedings, Manville is striving to overcome its
asbestos-tainted past and push ahead with a new strategic
thrust and a fresh, environmentally correct image. That task
is tough enough, given soft markets and entrenched
competition in many of its main businesses. But at every
turn, Manville is still dogged by the financial problems of
the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which was set
up to compensate asbestos victims.

   In a landmark agreement that got Manville out of
bankruptcy court, the company gave the trust $2.5 billion of
assets, mostly stock. It also promised to pay the trust $75
million annually beginning in August 1991, plus 20% of its
annual net income from 1992 until all claims are paid. It
contends that it has no further legal obligation.
   Others aren't so sure. "Manville is basically a very sound
company with good management," says Paul Kleinaitis, an
analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. "But the unknown is the
trust. No one knows what the ultimate liability will be."
   Meanwhile, the memory of asbestos lingers on, even as
company officials swear that Manville's reputation among
customers wasn't damaged. The company has became a born-again
environmentalist. A health, safety and environment committee
independent of management audits all operations and policies.
Scrubbers are being added to smokestacks, and waste sites and
water-storage ponds are being brought into compliance with
government regulations.
   The company is clearly wary of the power of
product-liability law. It is the only major company that
stamps a warning label on its two-by-fours and other wood
products. (Wood dust can harm lungs.) And when the
International Agency for Research on Cancer said diatomaceous
earth, which is used as a filler and as a filter, might cause
cancer, Manville added a warning label to the product even
though that action stirred customer resistance, especially in
cancer-wary Japan. Manville stood its ground as sales slipped
and, eventually, regained prior levels.
   "We want to be way out front in safety and health issues,"
says Richard A. Kashnow, recently named president of the new
engineered-products group. "We want to set some standards for
ethical behavior in those regards."
   Image-makers say this kind of aggressive environmental
makeover is the only way to reinvent a company whose name has
become synonymous with health problems. "You can't just
change the name, you can't just redesign the logo and
everything will be all right," says Gershon Kekst, a New York
public-relations executive (not in Manville's employ).
"You've got to come to grip with reality."
   However, another reality -- the fact that the trust is
running out of cash -- keeps intruding. Earlier this month, a
state court judge and a federal judge presiding over 450
asbestos lawsuits stemming from 1940s employment at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard asked, in an unusual joint memorandum,
whether the trust's overseers had considered going back to
bankruptcy court to alleviate a cash crunch that has impaired
its ability to pay claims. As the New York judges interpreted
the law, the bankruptcy court could choose to lift an
injunction barring asbestos victims from suing Manville
directly. They also suggested that the court could increase
the company's payments to the trust. They even hinted that
they might appoint a receiver for the trust if it didn't work
out its problems.
   The resulting legal uncertainty rattled Manville
investors, who promptly deluged its investor-relations
department with calls. Although the stock fell just 50 cents
a share to $6.50 over the two days following the hearing, 20%
of the common shares not held by the trust changed hands.
(The trust owns 50% of the common, which closed at $7 a share
yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.)
   In response to the judges' questions, the trust filed a
memorandum in court Tuesday arguing that reopening the
reorganization plan "would jeopardize the very structure of
the plan." Anything raising uncertainty about Manville's
liability, the trust added, reduces the value of Manville
stock and therefore the trust's assets. The trust also said
that "no mismanagement has occurred nor is there an emergency
warranting the drastic measure of receivership as suggested
by the court," adding that only 8% of the money spent by the
trust has gone to pay its own costs and its attorney fees.
The rest -- about $750 million -- has gone or been earmarked
to pay claims. The judges will respond to the memorandum at a
hearing tomorrow.
   Manville executives and bankruptcy experts doubt that the
injunction will be overturned. Court-approved reorganization
plans are rarely modified, especially so late in the game.
Furthermore, says Richard Von Wald, Manville's general
counsel, "If the injunction is challenged, we'll all be
spending a lot of money on legal fees that should be going to
plaintiffs."
   The trust has already doled out to some 22,000 claimants
most of the $800 million-plus in cash it had when it started,
and it can't sell its common-stock holdings until year end.
It rejected as too low a company offer to buy back the
trust's preferred stock for $500 million; instead, the trust
plans to borrow assets to tide it over until Manville cash
starts flowing next year. Borrowing, however, has been made
more difficult by the New York judges' statements and the
publicity they received, the trust said in its memo to the
judges.
   "Everybody knew that we would have no income in 1990,"
says Marianna Smith, the trust's executive director.
"Everybody knew this was going to be troublesome."
   But some plaintiffs' attorneys think that the trust paid
out too much to early claimants -- the average settlement has
been about $42,000 -- and to attorneys. So far, 152,000
claims have been filed, and at least 3,000 more are expected.
With cash short, victims filing this year won't be paid until
2004, and lawyers are suing the trust rather than settling.
"That means the trust ends up spending more money on
litigation and less to pay claims," says Stanley J. Levy,
chairman of the plaintiffs' committee during the bankruptcy
proceedings and now a Manville director.
   Even before the New York judges' action, plaintiffs'
attorneys were contemplating a challenge to the bankruptcy
plan and to the injunction against suing Manville. "If
Manville has to put more of its profits into the trust, maybe
that's what has to happen," says Perry Weitz, an attorney
representing 2,000 asbestos claimants.
   Renegotiating the bankruptcy agreement would certainly
impede the ambitious plans Mr. Stephens started sketching
back in 1986, when he took command of the shattered company.
Although it was still solvent, the compounding liability risk
from asbestos-related lawsuits had driven Manville into
bankruptcy court in 1982. Manville sold its asbestos mines
and quit making asbestos products, which once produced nearly
half its operating profit.
   The company used its time in bankruptcy court to expand
its fiberglass operations and its 50%-owned platinum mine and
to absorb newly purchased Olinkraft Inc., a large
forest-products company. It also slashed its costs, shrinking
its payroll from 30,000 to 17,000, reducing the ranks of
senior vice presidents from 12 to five and trimming its jet
fleet from five planes to two. Nearly $500 million was sunk
into money-saving capital improvements, mostly to update
equipment. Employees pitched in: At one plant, maintenance
workers improved a wire mesh that controls the flow of
materials through a paper machine and saved $40,000 a month.
   Manville emerged from Chapter 11 late in 1988 and, for
1989, reported net income of $197 million -- its third
consecutive year of record earnings. And it has a $1 billion
war chest of cash and unused credit lines with which to
expand operations and buy new businesses. Already, the
forest-products group has acquired a beverage-carton business
in the U.S. and paper mills and corrugated paperboard plants
in Brazil as part of an ambitious plan to double its size in
five to seven years. The engineered-products group is
building a $65 million fiberglass plant in Waterville, Ohio.
   "This is a $2.2 billion company that has transformed
itself around new products and markets," says Mr. Kashnow,
the group's president.
   However, Manville still needs to modernize its plants.
Most of its fiberglass spinning plants, for instance, operate
on energy-gulping technology dropped by competitors 20 years
ago. The company will spend much of its 1990
capital-improvements budget of $300 million to upgrade those
facilities, Mr. Kashnow says.
   Meanwhile, Brazil's tough anti-inflation program is
squeezing profits at Manville's sizable forest-products and
corrugated-container operations there. New machines under
construction by U.S. and Canadian rivals threaten to flood
the U.S. paperboard market by early 1991, and continued
sluggishness in the construction and automobile markets will
limit 1990 earnings.
   The company also needs to regain the competitive edge it
lost while mired in bankruptcy court. "We'd lost good people,
customer support and new-product momentum," says Ronald
Mathewson, newly named president of Manville's building
products group. Mr. Mathewson's line of products, which once
numbered in the hundreds, has been reduced to non-asbestos
building insulation and roofing materials; the rest were sold
off. Now, he plans some aggressive buying.
   The new Ohio fiberglass plant illustrates Manville's hopes
and fears. Although the company expects to make up for lost
time with technology licensed from Nippon Electric Glass, Mr.
Kashnow acknowledges that major players such as Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corp. and PPG Industries Inc. gained major
footholds while Manville was reorganizing. In
fiber-reinforced plastics -- the burgeoning business for
plastic clones to replace metal parts -- Manville must build
its business slowly, Mr. Kashnow says. He will concentrate on
market niches and custom applications, such as the emerging
air-filters market and the undeveloped fiberglass
wall-covering market, rather than challenge the leaders in
the $500 million commodity glass-fibers market.
   As Thomas Johnson, president of the forest-products unit,
puts it, Manville's cost-cutting efforts may have made it a
low-cost producer, but that "is simply the ante to play the
game. It doesn't guarantee you can stay in the game."
   So marketing also is under scrutiny. Mr. Mathewson of the
construction group notes, for example, that the same Manville
building-insulation salesmen now call on contractors at muddy
construction projects, buyers in retail home-improvement
centers and architects nestled in fancy design centers. "We
are a production-driven company. We don't think markets and
marketing," Mr. Mathewson admits.
   By September, he vows, that will change. A specialist will
advise retailers on ways to sell Manville insulation; another
will work with architects to get them to specify it. The
company's computer system is being reprogrammed to ask
questions more closely related to customer service. "For
example, it will focus on how many on-time deliveries we made
today instead of how many pieces did we produce," Mr.
Mathewson says.
   Despite such efforts, he acknowledges that the company is
struggling to regain lost business. "There were a lot of
customers who said, `I'll stick with you, but I can't let you
be my major supplier,'" he says. While Manville was mired in
the bankruptcy proceedings, Owens-Corning took the lead in
the retail insulation business through aggressive
advertising.
   Though not disclosing market shares, Mr. Mathewson says
some lost customers are returning. Payless Cashways Inc., a
retailer based in Kansas City, is in negotiations to restore
Manville as an insulation supplier. The chain, which now
carries only Owens-Corning products, dropped Manville six
years ago.
   Mr. Stephens expects old wounds to heal. "There were lots
of critics who said this company couldn't perform," he says.
"But $1 billion in claims have been settled and the plan is
working and the company is performing above expectations."
   Yet he concedes that the healing process will be lengthy.
"We're used to seeing unbelievable problems solved in 30
minutes," the length of an episode on TV, he complains. "It's
going to take far longer than 30 minutes to solve problems
that were years in the making."
