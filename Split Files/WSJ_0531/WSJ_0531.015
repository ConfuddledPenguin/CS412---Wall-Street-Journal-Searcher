   HIGHER GAS PRICES are due this summer as more Americans
take to the road.
   The American Automobile Association says a record number
of vacationers -- more than 80% -- will take driving trips
this summer. And that will help boost gasoline prices between
five and nine cents a gallon, the AAA says. "The key will be
how strong the driving season is" says Warren Shimmerlik,
analyst for County NatWest USA.

   But analysts say other factors will keep gasoline prices
from surging. More efficient cars are curbing demand, says
Bernard Picchi of Salomon Brothers Inc. -- it's off about 1%
from last year. Moreover, currently tight supplies are
expected to ease. The reason? Many refineries now closed for
maintenance are expected back on line soon to take advantage
of higher margins, created by a sharp drop in the price of
crude this year.
   Consultant Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. says gas prices "are headed
for a collapse as refiners respond to high margins," but not
until the third quarter.
                                                                                                       

   DROUGHT PRODUCTS find a big market in Florida and
California.
   Stores in drought-stricken areas report strong demand for
items ranging from drums for collecting washing-machine water
to low-flow showerheads. Xeriscaping, which uses
drought-tolerant plants, is catching on in Florida, says
Ellin Goetz of J. Roland Lieber Landscape Architects, Naples.
Rain for Rent, a Bakersfield, Calif., firm that offers
equipment that lets wastewater be used on landscaping, says
the last four months have seen record sales.
   Santa Barbara, Calif., is giving $80 to anyone who
converts to a low-flush toilet. Home Improvement Center says
that's boosted sales to 330 in the last eight weeks, compared
with only "a few" each week previously. Those in the
businesses don't expect the market to dry up at drought's
end. "Everybody is conservation-oriented now," says Beverly
Munns of Resources Conservation Inc., Greenwich, Conn.
   One unlikely drought product: Creative Energy, San Rafael,
Calif., touts its spas, saying they can save a family 900
gallons of hot water a month.
                                                                                                       

   REAL ESTATE AUCTIONS boom, partly because of savings and
loan troubles.
   Auction Co. of America, Miami, says its sales will jump to
more than $500 million this year from $186 million last year,
thanks to a contract to sell real estate for the Resolution
Trust Corp. "This is an auctioneer's dream," says Jim Gall,
chief executive. Industry watchers are waiting to see if the
September auctions bring top dollar. "If this works," there
will be a lot of pressure to move more real estate by
auction, says Christopher Beard of Turnarounds &amp; Workouts
newsletter, Washington.
   Other real estate auctioneers say they are having banner
years even without the RTC's business. "The phone is ringing
off the hook," says Steven Good, president of Sheldon Good &amp;
Co. Chicago. One reason: Many sellers are "in a foot race" to
beat the Resolution Trust to market. Twelve firms did more
than $25 million each in auction sales last year, says
Turnarounds &amp; Workouts, noting problem real estate loans
promise significant future growth.
   One obstacle: the need for adequate time for due diligence
in commercial building sales, says Robert Rudin of Edward S.
Gordon Co. of New Jersey.
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERS HAVE ETHICS, says a poll for Robert Half
International Inc., Menlo Park, Calif. They were cited by 34%
of executives as being the most ethical type of professional.
CPAs came in second at 24%. Investment bankers got only 1% of
the vote.
                                                                                                       

   HISTORIC PLACES on the most endangered list include
Antietam National Battlefield Park and the gold-rush town of
Deadwood's historic district, says the National Trust for
Historic Preservation. Also among the 11 named: New Orleans'
French Quarter and Walden Woods in Massachusetts.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN AND MINORITIES still fare poorly in drug company
ads, says Karen Tietze and Maya Smith of the Philadelphia
College of Pharmacy and Science. No female doctors appear in
any ads sampled from either 1979 or 1989; only one in the
1989 sample featured a minority doctor.
                                                                                                       

   CLASS REUNIONS turn into a big business as more women go
back to work.
   In 1981, all high school reunions were organized by
volunteers, but by 1995, one in three will be planned by a
professional, says the National Association of Reunion
Planners, which has seen membership grow to 60 companies from
only three in 1984. Why the surge? "Ten years ago, there were
still enough women at home doing volunteer work," says Betsy
Flaherty of the Reunion Co., Rockville, Md. Today, they
"don't have the time, and what time they do have they don't
want to spend calling 300 alumni."
   Growth potential is enormous, says Shell Norris of Class
Reunion Inc., who pioneered the industry with a part-time
business in 1982. He estimates that Chicago alone has 1,500
reunions each year. His company handles just 115 to 120.
Planners say 10-year reunions are their least favorite. "The
cliques are still intact," says Mr. Norris.
   "In Colorado, they have three-day events," says Linda
Davis of High Class Reunions, Mountain View, Calif. In
California: one-nighters.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Most skateboard injuries occur on homemade or
scoop-shaped skateboards, says physician Richard Dominguez in
Working Mother magazine. . . . Geo Expeditions, Sonora,
Calif., offers "ecologically responsible" Himalayan trekking
where trekkers stay in huts, not tents.
