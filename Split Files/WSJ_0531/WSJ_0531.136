   Avery International Corp., which last week agreed to merge
with Dennison Manufacturing Co., said it expects fiscal
second-quarter net income to be "in excess of 10% below" the
year-ago level on a projected 5% sales increase.
   For the year-earlier quarter, Avery posted net of $24.1
million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $446 million.
Avery's fiscal second quarter ends today.

   Charles D. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Pasadena, Calif.-based company, told securities analysts
in New York that the expected lower earnings reflect
"significantly slower" demand by car makers and owners for
Avery's decorative films and labels.
   "Sales bookings turned up" in May, Mr. Miller said,
"encouraging us to believe the last half of the year could be
better than the first. Overall, we continue to believe that
for the full year we can exceed last year's results."
   Yesterday, Avery shares fell $1.50 to $24.75 on volume of
more than 1.5 million shares in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
