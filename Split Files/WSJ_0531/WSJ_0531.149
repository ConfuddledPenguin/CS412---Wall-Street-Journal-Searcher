   NEW YORK -- A red-hot research pipeline has made Thermo
Electron a darling of the stock market. The Waltham, Mass.,
company has promising products in such businesses as
pollution control, bomb and drug detection, and cogeneration,
or the production of energy from waste heat.
   Now, with the shares up 72% since the start of 1989, a
number of investors are turning cautious on the stock. Not
only is it trading at an above-market multiple of nearly 25
times the past 12 months' earnings, the skeptics say, but
those earnings depend nearly as much on clever financial
management as on operations.

   Think of Thermo Electron as a big research-and-development
shop. Promising projects are partly spun off as new publicly
traded companies. There are five Thermo offspring at the
moment, and the company's chief financial officer, John N.
Hatsopoulos, says there may be 15 or more by the end of the
decade.
   Thermedics (62%-owned by Thermo Electron), makes devices
to detect bombs and drugs. Thermo Process Systems (77%-owned)
makes equipment to incinerate hazardous wastes and detoxify
contaminated soil. Thermo Instrument (80%-owned) makes
instruments to measure and control pollutants. Tecogen
(78%-owned) makes natural gas cogeneration units and is
working on a low-emission natural gas engine.
   Investors' pulses also race for a heart-assist device made
by Thermo Cardiosystems (39%-owned, mostly through
Thermedics). The parent company also has operations of its
own, mainly in building and operating cogeneration plants.
Last week it privately sold, for $8.5 million, a 10% interest
in the operating end of the business. With such products, and
a cash-rich balance sheet, it's little wonder that Thermo
Electron stock has surged 14% this year to yesterday's close
of 34 7/8, up 1/4, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   Today's price would be easier to justify if the vast
majority of earnings came from operations, but recently that
hasn't been the case. In 1989, Thermo Electron earned about
$34.2 million before taxes ($24.6 million after taxes) on
sales of $579 million. But only about half of its profit came
from operations. Gains on issuance of stock in subsidiaries
were close to $17 million. (The "issuance" mainly took place
as holders of convertible debentures exchanged them for
stock.) Net interest income was about $2 million.
   There's nothing wrong with making money through savvy
financial management. But profits from financial engineering
probably aren't what many investors think of when they buy
Thermo Electron.
   Its multiple of nearly 25 times earnings at yesterday's
close makes the stock one of the priciest on the Big Board,
where the average stock's multiple is now about 16 -- and
that's above the historical norm itself. And Thermo
Electron's price is approaching 50 times last year's
operating earnings.
   Mr. Hatsopoulos, the company's financial chief and brother
of its chief executive officer, George N. Hatsopoulos, says
its percentage of profit from sources other than operations
"will come down dramatically over the next two or three
years." Without the partial spinoffs, he says, "we couldn't
afford to finance all these new ventures unless we were
General Electric."
   Wall Street analysts generally expect Thermo Electron to
earn about $1.60 a share this year, compared with $1.35 a
share in 1989, and to reach $1.90 a share next year.
Optimists such as Dick Martin of Louis Nicoud &amp; Associates
look for $2.05 a share in 1991.
   Even this still means the stock is selling at 17 times the
optimists' guesses for next year's earnings. But so what,
asks John Bowen, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in San
Diego. Thermo's major units, he says, are "right on the verge
of some good earnings," and "you've kind of got to throw the
P-E (price-earnings ratio) out the window."
   Not so fast, say skeptics. "The quality of earnings is
quite low" because non-operating earnings are such a large
portion of the mix, says Walter Peterson, analyst with
Ferris, Baker Watts. "Return on equity has been 11% to 12%.
That's disappointing for a reputed high-tech company." He's
also concerned about Thermo Instrument's pending acquisition
of Finnigan. It would give Thermo Instrument better
distribution in Europe, but Finnigan had been posting losses.
   Overall, Mr. Peterson rates Thermo Electron a hold. He
would buy if it drops much below $30 a share but would sell
at prices above $40.
   Mr. Hatsopoulos says the fair value is higher, maybe $50 a
share, based mainly on the current market value of Thermo
Electron's stakes in subsidiaries. The parent's share of the
various units has a current market value of about $43 a
share. He hastens to add that a corporate acquirer might pay
$70 to $80 a share for all the pieces.
   But several money managers who have sold the stock
recently say it is already fully priced. Others are holding
on to their Thermo Electron stock but wouldn't buy more at
today's prices. Roland W. Gillis, who manages the Keystone
S-4 Fund in Boston and owns more than 80,000 Thermo Electron
shares, says he would lighten his holdings if the stock moved
into the 40s and would buy more if the stock fell 10% from
recent levels.
