   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Former Arkla Inc. executive Sheffield
Nelson won the Republican nomination for governor of
Arkansas, besting Tommy Robinson in a bitterly personal
campaign.
   The defeat of Mr. Robinson, a flamboyant U.S. congressman
who described himself as a "junkyard dog," was also a setback
for the powerful Little Rock investment-banking firm of
Stephens Inc. Chairman Jackson T. Stephens heavily backed Mr.
Robinson, causing Mr. Nelson to charge that the chairman was
out to destroy him politically.

   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton, who's widely thought to
harbor presidential ambitions, won renomination for a fifth
term. But the governor's percentage of the vote, about 54% in
a six-candidate race, was lower than expected.
   Mr. Nelson is the former chief executive officer of
Shreveport-based Arkla, owner of Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.
He's a Democrat-turned-Republican, as is Rep. Robinson, whose
political conversion was announced by President Bush last
year.
