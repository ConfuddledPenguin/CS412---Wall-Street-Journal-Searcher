   Earlier in the day, Tyco announced an offer to acquire the
36.7% of Nasta International Inc. that it doesn't already own
for $1.75 a share in cash. Nasta has a total of about 5.1
million shares outstanding.
   Nasta said it appointed a committee of disinterested
directors to review and recommend action on the offer.
