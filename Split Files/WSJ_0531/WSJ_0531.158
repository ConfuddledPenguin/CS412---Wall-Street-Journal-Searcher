   If the European Community can get all its internal
problems ironed out (How does Eastern Europe fit into this?
How much sovereignty is each of us willing to give up? Can we
all get along with Mrs. Thatcher?), a new Europe will start
business in 1992. People, money and trade will flow freely
across borders without the restrictions that now apply.
   Some Americans are frightened by the prospect of this
development. They figure that the free internal market will
produce much larger and more competitive European firms that
will win sales away from U.S. companies both in Europe and
elsewhere. They fear that the Europeans will become
increasingly protectionist, trying to guard their expanded
market against Americans and all other outsiders.

   Such fears are by no means new. When the Common Market was
founded in 1958, there were many who saw a plot to screen out
American goods. One result was a continuing increase in U.S.
investment in plant and equipment in Europe -- an investment
that helps to make the Europe '92 fears largely unfounded.
   Whether by plan or by luck, such investment prepared U.S.
firms both for the EC as it was and the EC as it evolved. The
community was formed in 1958 with six members: Belgium,
France, Italy, West Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Over the years the group added Denmark, Greece, Ireland, the
United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. When a new nation
entered, it usually was already a base for U.S. firms.
   The prime example is the U.K., which became a member of
the EC in 1973. In 1966, not surprisingly, our neighbor
Canada was the host to the largest number of American firms,
but the U.K. already ranked second or third in most
industries.
   As a result, there has been no last-minute surge of U.S.
investment in the EC to prepare for Europe '92. In National
Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 3293, Robert E.
Lipsey of Queens College says the lack of expansion plans by
U.S. companies already in the EC may reflect satisfaction
with their current positions. "There is a widespread feeling
that American firms already established in Europe are already
ahead of European firms in treating the EC as a single
market," Mr. Lipsey writes.
   The author quotes a British magazine, the Economist, as
saying that General Motors and Ford have more "Europewide
strength" than any of their local competitors, strong though
many of them may be in their own national markets. The same
is true in their fields for other American companies such as
IBM, Digital Equipment and Unisys.
   Protectionism is no particular worry, moreover, because
U.S. manufacturing affiliates and even wholesale trade
affiliates in the EC are largely independent of imports from
the U.S. For manufacturing affiliates, imports from the U.S.
account for about 5% of sales in the EC.
   A lot of the merger and acquisition activity in the recent
past and in the near future is likely to involve European
companies seeking partners to extend their reach more widely
around Europe. The Economist suggests that some EC firms may
try to do this with mergers, joint ventures or other
arrangements with U.S. firms already in Europe.
   U.S. companies now outside the EC are in fact engaging in
some such transactions with EC firms; sometimes the prime
beneficiary is the U.S. firm. General Mills, for instance,
has announced a venture with Nestle to sell breakfast food in
Europe where General Mills's main rival, Kellogg, is already
entrenched as a producer. The cost of the plan was estimated
in the tens of millions, not an amount that would qualify as
a major international investment.
   The available evidence indicates it is unlikely that there
will be any rush of U.S. firms to enter Europe before 1992.
"It is hard to find evidence on rates of new entry," Mr.
Lipsey says, "but a survey conducted for KPMG Peat Marwick,
among a sample of executives in almost 600 companies in high
technology, other manufacturing, transportation, and
merchandising, found that of those (29% of the total) not
currently doing business in the EC, over two thirds said they
had no plans to do business there either before or after
1992."
   Only 6% of the sample project some sort of entry into the
EC before 1992. Surveys indicate a large proportion of the
new entrants will opt for joint ventures -- an unusual
decision for U.S. firms, which usually prefer 100% ownership
or at least majority control of any foreign operations.
Opting for joint ventures obviously limits the investment,
and thus it is not a strong indication of a pell-mell rush to
participate. Some of the joint venturers may be smaller
firms, interested in a piece of the action but unable to buy
a large piece.
   Another reason for U.S. firms to participate in joint
ventures, Mr. Lipsey suggests, is to have an opportunity to
enter markets dominated by public procurement; that probably
led to the recently launched joint AT&amp;T-Philips venture to
produce telecommunications equipment.
   There is no intention here to suggest that U.S. companies
are losing interest in doing business in Europe -- or are
blind to the 1992 deadline. Some companies are entering
Europe for the first time, and when this happens the firms
nearly always list 1992 as one of the reasons. It was cited
last year, for instance, when Intel announced plans to build
a $400 million computer plant in Ireland.
   But U.S. corporations have been doing business in Europe
for a very long time, and they're accustomed to the fact that
the rules and circumstances sometimes do change in Europe,
pretty much as they do in the U.S. An intelligent U.S.
businessman tries to stay alert and, if possible, adjust to
such changes even before they happen.
   This time, at least, it looks like the Yanks did a pretty
good job.
