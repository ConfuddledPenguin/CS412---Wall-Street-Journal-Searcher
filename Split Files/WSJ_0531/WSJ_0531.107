   INDIANAPOLIS -- Robert Fitzgerald, like most art dealers,
has never dealt in Van Goghs or Renoirs or Matisses. His is
the other world of art -- a few blocks or a few thousand
miles removed from MOMA and Madison Avenue -- where lesser
works, some of insignificant, obscure or dubious provenance,
make their way to market.
   Even so, the sizzling market for art of all kinds has been
good to Mr. Fitzgerald. More than 20 years ago he discovered
that the clay artifacts he could pick up for a pittance in
South America sold for much bigger profits in Los Angeles
than the exotic animals he was pursuing in treks through the
rain forest. Since then, the smooth-talking, 53-year-old
dealer, who tools around Indianapolis in his Jaguar, has been
jetting around the globe, tracking down and acquiring
desirable works for smaller museums and rich individual
collectors.

   In Mr. Fitzgerald's niche in the art market, it hasn't
always hurt business that some people think of him as an
engaging rogue. Says Indianapolis dealer Peg Goldberg, a big
loser in dealings with Mr. Fitzgerald: "He's one of the most
fascinating creatures on two legs. He can tell stories and
jokes and sing nightclub songs nonstop. His typical story:
He's smuggling guns into some Latin country for the CIA and
taking pre-Columbian art out."
   Says Mr. Fitzgerald: "If you spend any time in Latin
America, people think you must be with the CIA, so I just go
along with it." He also says: "I'm not as pure as the driven
snow. The art business is a tough business." And: "I'm only
guilty of making a profit."
   Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Indiana
law-enforcement officers say otherwise. They say he is a
crook. But he was never accused of a crime until 1989, when
he was charged in Marion County Superior Court in
Indianapolis with masterminding a 1984 theft of African and
other objects of art. Valued at $100,000 to $200,000, the art
was stolen from a doctor's home. Mr. Fitzgerald has pleaded
not guilty; his trial is scheduled for June.
   The dealer vigorously maintains his innocence. "If I were
going to steal, why go after a little collector like the
doctor?" he asks. "I'd go after a big collector worth
millions."
   If nothing else, however, his career illustrates other
aspects of the netherworld of art. Few dealers may outright
steal, but people in the business say many have, with
impunity, misrepresented the age, provenance or quality of
antiquities they sell, charged wildly inflated prices, and
handled art works that others have stolen, smuggled or faked.
Often the deals are done in a rush, with few questions asked.
All this has made the world of art a dangerous place for
unwary collectors and investors.
   The skyrocketing prices on works of art have brought a big
rise in art theft around the world. The International
Foundation for Art Research in New York circulates a periodic
bulletin describing missing works. For the past three years,
the number reported has exceeded 1,000 a year, up from about
700 a year in the mid-1980s and 500 a year in the early
1980s.
   Rarely have authorities penetrated the sophisticated rings
of thieves and fences who dispose of these pieces, some of
them so well-known that their purchasers dare not risk
displaying them to others. Few works are quickly recovered. A
missing Picasso recently turned up in Miami when a New York
dealer tried to buy it for $300,000, but it had been stolen
from a Baltimore apartment 20 years ago.
   There is also a thriving market in the U.S. for
pre-Columbian art -- not stolen, exactly, but looted from
ancient tombs and then smuggled from Latin American countries
in violation of their laws, and in some cases U.S. law.
Recently the discovery of gold artifacts in the tombs of
Moche civilization noblemen in Peru has touched off even more
looting and smuggling. Last year, a Los Angeles dealer was
convicted and sentenced to prison for smuggling Moche art.
   As it turns out, Mr. Fitzgerald has acted as a middleman
in a number of questionable art transactions.
   Born in Toledo, he moved to Los Angeles in his early 20s.
From there, he says, he began roving in South America to
capture jaguars, parrots and other animals for sale to
collectors. On one trip, he says, he bought a batch of
pre-Columbian pots in Peru for $200 and sold them to a
gallery in Los Angeles for nearly $8,000. "I said, `Goodbye,
animal business,'" he recalls.
   By the time the U.S. had begun clamping down on the
smuggling of certain pre-Columbian antiquities in the 1980s,
Mr. Fitzgerald had discovered Africa. And he had moved to
Indianapolis -- partly, he says, to be closer to Harrison
Eiteljorg, a client who with his help has assembled a notable
collection of African art. Mr. Fitzgerald had also changed
his name, from Jones to Fitzgerald. He says Jones was the
name of the grandparents who raised him, and Fitzgerald his
parents'.
   Another dealer says that Bob Jones had come to be viewed
with some misgivings by colleagues. "Everybody has a Bob
Jones story, or three or four," says Al Stendahl, a Los
Angeles dealer in pre-Columbian art. "He is a
wheeler-dealer."
   As Mr. Fitzgerald, he had his first brush with
international notoriety in 1987, after a Parisian dealer,
Michel de Bry, discovered a seven-inch statue that supposedly
had served Michelangelo himself as the model for celebrated
"David." Through another dealer, in Amsterdam, Mr. Fitzgerald
learned that Mr. de Bry needed cash and would sell the
mini-Michelangelo. Mr. de Bry agreed to sell a half-interest
to the Amsterdam dealer and Mr. Fitzgerald for $3 million.
   Mr. Fitzgerald recalls whipping out his checkbook in
Europe and writing a postdated check for $3 million on his
account at a Florida savings and loan association. Could the
check have cleared, even on the future date? "Hell, no]" Mr.
Fitzgerald says -- unless, as he had hoped, he could persuade
a certain client to cover it and acquire an interest in the
statue. The client came to London. But the deal fell through.
Mr. Fitzgerald says Mr. de Bry failed to show clear title to
the statue, a claim Mr. de Bry disputes. Both dealers wound
up suing each other; the litigation has never been concluded.
   Mr. Fitzgerald's dealer friend in Amsterdam was Michel van
Rijn. In May 1988, a year after the abortive Michelangelo
deal, Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Goldberg, his dealer
acquaintance from Indianapolis, went to Amsterdam and there
discussed some rare Byzantine mosaics that Mr. van Rijn knew
were for sale by a collector in Munich. Ms. Goldberg says she
fell in love with the mosaics when she saw photographs of
them, depicting Christ, an archangel and two Apostles.
   Ms. Goldberg said she would buy the mosaics for possible
resale. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. van Rijn would act as brokers
in selling the mosaics to her.
   The Munich collector, Ms. Goldberg was told by the two
men, was ill, and needed cash fast -- $3 million in cash. "I
said, `Get serious,' " Ms. Goldberg recalls, "and I finally
negotiated the price down to about $1 million." Even so, "Bob
was screaming and having a nervous breakdown," asserting, she
says, that he couldn't afford to broker the sale at such a
low price.
   Convinced that the two dealers were making little or no
commission, Ms. Goldberg agreed to give each of them 22.5% of
any resale profit and 5% to their lawyer. Mr. Fitzgerald and
Ms. Goldberg then met the Munich collector in Geneva and
inspected the mosaics. Ms. Goldberg, who had arranged for
credit at a Swiss bank, says she went to the bank, drew out
$1,080,000 in $100 bills, and gave the money to Mr.
Fitzgerald and his attorney, who packed it in two gym bags.
   According to undisputed testimony in subsequent litigation
in federal court in Indianapolis, the two men then went to a
Geneva hotel and paid the Munich collector, but only
$350,000. Of the $730,000 remaining, $150,00 went for legal
fees, $282,500 to Mr. van Rijn, and $297,500 to Mr.
Fitzgerald. The money for himself and Mr. van Rijn was simply
their commission, Mr. Fitzgerald says. "I was only making
this much," he says, holding his thumb and forefinger close
together -- "compared to the $20 million (in resale profits)
Peg was going to make." After collecting his commission, Mr.
Fitzgerald sold his interest in the resale profits to an
Indianapolis man for $375,000. That brought Mr. Fitzgerald's
total gain in the deal to more than $670,000.
   Ms. Goldberg feels deceived. "I never would have given a
share in the resale profits if I had thought they were making
an upfront commission," she says.
   Ms. Goldberg took the mosaics back to Indianapolis and
offered them to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $20
million. But the Getty had no interest in Byzantine mosaics
-- and museum officials immediately suspected that the
sixth-century antiquities were the ones that had been looted
from a church on Cyprus after Turkey invaded and occupied
part of the island in 1974. The museum alerted the Greek
Cypriot government, which sued Ms. Goldberg in federal court
in Indianapolis to recover the mosaics. Last year a federal
judge ordered them returned to Cyprus. Ms. Goldberg has
appealed the order.
   None of the dealers involved say they had any reason to
suspect that the mosaics had been stolen. Other authorities
say it seems strange that the sale was concluded in only a
few days and that no one took the time to verify the
provenance of the mosaics before Ms. Goldberg acquired them.
   Mr. Fitzgerald's most serious problem also began in 1988,
with the publicized recovery of a stolen painting. In June,
Mike Nichol, a dealer in Bremen, Ind., gave Mr. Fitzgerald
and Jerry Mulholland, a small-time Cincinnati coin dealer, a
check for $72,000 in return for an American Impressionist
painting that Mr. Nichol was buying for a New Mexico dealer.
Mr. Fitzgerald had represented Jacob Schott of Cincinnati as
the owner of the painting and said the sale had to be kept
quiet. "Fitz said that the painting was on the market because
of an upcoming divorce and that the owner did not want the
painting in auction, or appearing in an advertisement, for
several years," Mr. Nichol says.
   But when the New Mexico dealer saw his new acquisition, he
thought he recognized it as one that had been reported
stolen, and told Mr. Nichol he was calling the FBI. The
bureau began an investigation, eventually cracking a ring of
thieves that had been stealing art from rich Cincinnati
households for years. Two of the defendants, Messrs.
Mulholland and Schott, pleaded guilty to federal charges of
interstate transportation of stolen goods. They were fined
and given brief prison sentences.
   Mr. Fitzgerald denies any knowledge that the painting he
helped sell through Mr. Nichol was stolen. "I was duped," he
says. He wasn't charged in the Cincinnati case. But the FBI
was on a new casehis.
   In Mr. Schott's home in Cincinnati, agents had found an
Oriental rug that had been stolen, with many other art
pieces, from the home of Hanus Grosz in Indianapolis in 1984.
Mr. Schott told the agents that Mr. Fitzgerald had planned
the Grosz theft.
   The FBI made Mr. Mulholland, the coin dealer, an
informant. Agents concealed an electronic recorder in his
clothing and sent him to see Mr. Fitzgerald last year. A
transcript of their conversation in the possession of
authorities shows that Mr. Mulholland referred to art from
Dr. Grosz's house, and mentioned other names. "I don't want
any names mentioned around the house . . .," Mr. Fitzgerald
said.
   "Well, that's why we went outside," Mr. Mulholland said.
   "The FBI have very sophisticated equipment and they could
put it in the driveway now and you're out there mentioning
names," Mr. Fitzgerald went on. "I asked you not to do that a
million times. It'll hang you."
   Mr. Fitzgerald explains the conversation this way: He
dislikes mentioning names because they could implicate him
mistakenly in some sort of shady business. "I have enough
trouble," he says. "I don't need any more." He says Messrs.
Schott and Mulholland got short prison sentences for
cooperating with federal agents, and so, he says, "They'll
name anybody."
   The FBI's case against Mr. Fitzgerald in the Indianapolis
theft was turned over to Indiana authorities.
   Even those who may have been taken by Mr. Fitzgerald are
amazed at the theft charges against him. Ms. Goldberg, the
dealer who bought the stolen mosaics, says she may sue Mr.
Fitzgerald if she loses her legal battle to retain them. But,
she says, "I can't believe Bob was involved in any theft."
   Mr. Nichol, who has already filed suit against Mr.
Fitzgerald to recover the money he paid for the stolen
painting, says that he is "absolutely convinced Bob had
nothing to do with {the theft}. . . . It's totally unlike
Bob. He would run away from that kind of deal with track
shoes."
   Mr. Fitzgerald fervently agrees. "I'm super careful," he
says. "I ask where pieces come from. You know they don't fall
out of the sky."
