   Intel Corp. said it resolved to stop using ozone-damaging
chlorofluorocarbons at its manufacturing plants by 1992.
   The Santa Clara, Calif., company, which makes
microcomputer parts and systems, said it is starting "an
aggressive world-wide program" to find alternative
manufacturing techniques that don't rely on CFCs. Intel's
measures are in response to a federal goal to eliminate
industry's use of CFCs by the year 2000. The move is in line
with a tentative industrywide effort by chip makers to rid
the ozone-depleting emissions from their plants.

   Intel began this process three years ago, when it started
tracking CFC levels at its plants. Since then, Intel says it
has lowered its CFC use by about 30%, by experimenting with
new conservation and control methods.
   A company spokesman said the new equipment that Intel
plans to install to replace CFCs will cost several hundred
thousand dollars and "in the long run, it will probably be
cheaper." The entire program won't run more than several
million dollars, the spokesman said.
