   MONTREAL -- The Quebec government will name Jean-Claude
Delorme, a veteran telecommunications executive, chairman of
Caisse de Depot et Placement, the government's powerful
pension-fund agency, according to people familiar with the
appointment.
   The announcement, expected tomorrow, will end months of
speculation in Quebec business circles. Caisse de Depot,
which is both feared for its power and revered as a concrete
example of French-speaking Quebecers' growing economic clout,
manages 34.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$29 billion) in
assets and is one of the biggest players in Canadian
financial markets.

   "Mr. Delorme has accepted the post," said Claude Gareau,
an associate at Heidrick Struggles Woods Gordon Inc., the
executive search concern that conducted the hunt for a new
chairman.
   Chairman Jean Campeau (no relation to the Toronto
businessman Robert Campeau) transformed the once sleepy
Caisse de Depot into an investment powerhouse during his two
five-year terms, the second of which expired in March. Mr.
Campeau, 58 years old, agreed to stay on for a few months,
but never said whether he was seeking reappointment to
another term. Under his hands-on direction, Caisse de Depot
has consistently beaten broad measures of Canadian stock and
bond market performance in recent years. Last year, the
agency's stock portfolio had a total return of 22.7%,
compared with 21.4% for the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index.
Caisse de Depot's bond portfolio had a return of 14.6% last
year, compared with 12.8% for a reference index compiled by a
Toronto brokerage house.
   Mr. Delorme is president and chief executive officer of
the Teleglobe Canada Inc. unit of Memotec Data Inc., a
Montreal-based telecommunications and communications
equipment concern. Teleglobe provides overseas communications
services for Canadian telephone companies, and was formerly
owned by the Canadian government.
   Neither Mr. Delorme nor Mr. Campeau was available to
comment.
   "I think Mr. Delorme has ideal qualifications" for the
Caisse de Depot post, said H. Arnold Steinberg, a Memotec
director who first met Mr. Delorme in the 1960s. Mr. Delorme
"is highly regarded throughout the (Quebec) business
community," Mr. Steinberg said.
   The appointment of Mr. Delorme, who is viewed as a
diplomatic executive with broad experience dealing with
governments, is also a sign Caisse de Depot will make more
investments outside Canada, said a person familiar with the
situation. As president of Teleglobe, Mr. Delorme deals with
dozens of foreign governments and companies.
   Mr. Delorme also is expected to tone down Caisse de
Depot's reputation as an aggressive investor that always
likes to get its own way. "I don't think he'll beat up on you
in the corner," said a Montreal investment banker, adding
somewhat wistfully that Mr. Delorme "probably won't be as
exciting as Jean Campeau."
   Though widely praised for its investment performance,
Caisse de Depot is privately criticized for taking too active
a role at small and medium-sized Quebec companies in which it
holds significant stakes. "I think if you took a poll of
those Quebec companies, people would say, `We regret taking
in Caisse de Depot as a partner,'" the investment banker
said.
   Public criticism of the agency, no matter how polite, is
almost unheard of in Quebec. "It's like handling dynamite for
me to talk about it," a Montreal financial analyst said.
   Earlier this year, the entrepreneur Marcel Dutil paused at
the end of a speech here to take a polite shot at Caisse de
Depot. All conversation stopped. The financial analysts and
business people in the audience looked around uneasily, as
though they expected lightning to flash down from the ceiling
of the hotel ballroom and strike Mr. Dutil dead. Nothing
happened. Relieved, people applauded and smiled, as Mr. Dutil
continued his very mild critique.
   Outside the province, Caisse de Depot attracts attention
for its apparent Quebec nationalism. Last year, Caisse de
Depot helped tiny Socanav Inc., a Montreal shipping concern,
take over Steinberg Inc., a big grocery concern based here.
Socanav's winning C$1.33 billion bid, with Caisse de Depot as
a partner, beat out a competing bid by a Toronto group.
Caisse de Depot "makes princes out of princelings," an
executive at a Montreal brokerage firm said.
   Mindful of criticism that Mr. Campeau, who also has the
title of general manager, wields too much power at Caisse de
Depot, the government is expected to create a new position,
chief of operations. According to people familiar with the
situation, Guy Savard, a Sherbrooke, Quebec, accountant, will
be named to the new post. Mr. Savard also is a fund-raiser
for the governing Liberal Party. His appointment is seen as
less than certain. A Caisse de Depot executive said the
agency's managers "were very surprised" and are "worried" by
Mr. Savard's expected appointment. Mr. Savard couldn't be
reached to comment.
   According to local reports that couldn't be confirmed, Mr.
Campeau will be named chairman of Domtar Inc., a
Montreal-based forest products company. Caisse de Depot and
another Quebec government agency hold a controlling stake in
Domtar, which declined to comment on the reports.
