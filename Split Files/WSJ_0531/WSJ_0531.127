   TCBY Enterprises Inc., Little Rock, Ark., said it expects
to report earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter, ending today, up from 33 cents a share
in the year-ago period.
   However, the frozen-yogurt retailer, whose stock has been
something of a highflier on Wall Street, said it expects
sales at stores open more than a year will be down for the
quarter because of poor weather during April and May.
