   CHICAGO -- Several outside investors are considering
buying a majority stake in West Point-Pepperell Inc. from
cash-strapped owner William Farley, according to people on
Wall Street.
   Mr. Farley, who can't complete his $1.56 billion tender
offer because he lacks the funds to buy the remaining 5% of
West Point-Pepperell shares outstanding, may reluctantly
accept such a bid, people close to the transaction indicated.

   The investor may need a suitor with deep pockets to help
him complete the transaction.
   Officials at Farley Inc., the closely held manufacturing
concern and umbrella company for the investor's business
empire, declined to comment.
   Among the possible bidders mentioned by sources are two
New York investment concerns: Coniston Partners and
Blackstone Group. A Coniston official declined to comment on
the rumors, and Blackstone officials didn't return telephone
calls.
   One other investment concern rumored as a possible bidder,
Henley Group of New York, also declined comment. But a Henley
official said he previously expressed interest in West
Point-Pepperell to certain of Mr. Farley's bankers. The
official, who requested anonymity, said the inquiry fell
short of formal talks, however, and he added that he is no
longer interested. He wouldn't elaborate.
   People close to the West Point-Pepperell situation said
Mr. Farley may be receptive to an offer couched as a joint
venture -- one that repays much of his estimated $200 million
equity stake in the big West Point, Ga., textile concern.
   Pressure on Mr. Farley to accept such an offer, should one
come, is mounting. As reported, he may soon have to battle
his bondholders over voting control of West Point-Pepperell.
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., financial adviser to some of Mr.
Farley's bondholders, suggested to its clients last week that
they seek voting control, according to a person close to
those discussions.
   Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley and his creditors in
March when West Point Acquisition Corp., the unit he set up
to buy West Point-Pepperell, fell into default on $796
million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest payments.
   Last month, Mr. Farley offered to surrender majority
ownership of West Point-Pepperell, which he fought so hard to
win in a takeover battle last year. That offer would leave
Mr. Farley in control of West Point, however, through his
ownerhsip of a series of so-called super-voting privilege
common shares, people close to the situation said.
   But a new West Point suitor would presumably want to
acquire at least 51% of the common stock and control of the
super-voting shares, sources said. Such a bid would probably
include an offer to buy the bonds of certain of Mr. Farley's
debtholders at a sizable discount. But the bondholders might
find such a proposal attractive, now that Mr. Farley is in
default to them. The various issues of bonds held by Mr.
Farley's creditors have been trading in the range of 10 cents
to 35 cents on the dollar in recent weeks.
   People close to the West Point-Pepperell transaction said
a suitor may be welcomed by Mr. Farley's bankers, led by
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. He's about $83
million short of the cash needed to acquire the remaining 5%
of the West Point-Pepperell, and his debt restrictions won't
let him tap into its cash reserve to help pay interest on his
various loans unless the transaction is completed.
   While rumors of a possible outside bidder sparked interest
in bond-trading circles, there isn't much incentive for
prospective bidders to move fast: Mr. Farley's weak financial
condition may merely serve to make any bidder's position
stronger later.
   Mr. Farley's financial strength ebbed earlier this year
with the collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. His Farley Inc. had a pretax loss of about $40
million in 1989, analysts estimated.
