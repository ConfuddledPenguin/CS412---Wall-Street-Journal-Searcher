   WASHINGTON -- In the face of a torrent of recent ethical
scandals, members of the House and Senate are still happily
grabbing up speaking fees from special-interest groups.
   The pace-setters in 1989, according to congressional
financial disclosure forms, were lawmakers in key leadership
roles.

   Last year, when House members voted themselves a pay
raise, they agreed to forgo honoraria and most other forms of
outside income beginning next January. So it's hardly
surprising that there was something of a feeding frenzy in
1989.
   Senators, by contrast, were generally much more cautious
about taking huge amounts of speaking fees. They accepted a
total of $2 million in honoraria for personal use, a 23% drop
from 1988. The pending ethics investigations of seven
senators, all of whom are facing allegations involving their
ties to special-interest groups or contributors, seems to
have had a chilling effect.
   Once again, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski was the top honoraria recipient. The Chicago
Democrat collected $285,000 in speaking fees last year,
dwarfing the honoraria earned by any other member of
Congress. Many of the special-interest groups that paid to
hear the tax-writing chief have vital economic stakes in the
outcome of his panel's decisions. Citicorp, for instance,
paid $10,500 for a Rostenkowski appearance. Rep. Rostenkowski
gave all but $26,850 of the total to charity. Under House
rules, he could keep only the equivalent of 30% of his House
salary.
   Rep. William Gray, the majority whip, was the runner-up
with $164,098 in honoraria. The Philadelphia Democrat also
was reimbursed for 52 trips by special-interest groups and
others. He pocketed $25,000 in honoraria and donated $139,098
to charities.
   More senators than ever -- 34 -- didn't keep any honoraria
for personal use. That's almost twice the number who resisted
boosting their incomes with special interest speaking fees in
1988, according to an analysis by Common Cause, a citizens
lobby. Many other senators took pains to play down the gifts
and extra income they received.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), for example, reported that
he received a "National League {baseball} pass for the 1989
season that was not used." Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.), a
freshman, received "fruit baskets, vegetable plates and
infrequent meals" during stays at two Las Vegas hotels. "None
had a value in excess of $35," Sen. Reid carefully noted.
Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) wrote in a handwritten scrawl
that his trip to Kenya and the Sudan, underwritten by the
Americares Foundation Inc. of Connecticut, "was to encourage
parties to the Sudan Civil War to permit shipment of food to
starving refugees."
   Four senators who face ethics investigations for their
intervention on behalf of savings-and-loan executive Charles
Keating are among those who didn't keep any honoraria for
personal use. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), John Glenn (D.,
Ohio), and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) didn't accept any
honoraria, while John McCain gave all of the $30,250 he
earned from speeches to charity.
   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), the fifth member of the
so-called Keating Five, earned $52,800 in honoraria, mostly
from lecturing at the Washington Campus, a seminar program
for executives and business students in Washington.
   Sen. David Durenberger, the Minnesota Republican who faces
a public trial in the Senate next month on charges that he
violated Senate rules in a $100,000 book deal and in a
separate real-estate transaction, was among the top Senate
honoraria earners with $62,185. He kept $35,785.
   Sen. Durenberger also amended his disclosure filings from
previous years to include $484,000 he received from a
Minnesota bank in 1988 as a bridge loan on his McLean, Va.,
residence and to include free lodging he accepted at the
Florida condominium of a friend over the past three Christmas
holidays. He reported that these items had been inadvertently
omitted from his previous filings.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), the other senator facing
ethics charges for various ties to campaign contributors,
received $42,000 in honoraria, as well as trips financed by
special-interest groups, including the Securities Industry
Association. He kept $35,800 of the honoraria -- the legal
limit of 40% of the 1990 Senate salary of $89,500.
   The honoraria leader in the Senate was Minority Leader
Robert Dole (R., Kan.), who earned $108,900 in honoraria and
kept just under the legal limit. The rest went to a long list
of charities. Sen. Dole, who also led the pack in 1987,
grossed a much more modest $67,750 in honoraria in 1988.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine)
received $50,000 in honoraria, not quite enough to push him
into the top 10. He kept $39,000. (Sen. Mitchell's bigger
take is based on his larger salary of $99,500 as majority
Leader).
   There were amusing nuggets buried in some of the
disclosures: Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) received $657 in
royalties for appearing in an episode of "The Cosby Show."
According to an aide, Mr. Bradley portrayed a doctor
colleague of Cliff Huxtable, the character played by comedian
Bill Cosby, and was seen playing basketball during the show,
which was broadcast on Feb. 23, 1989; Sen. Robert Byrd (D.,
W.Va.) received $120 in royalties for a record album of
fiddle tunes he recorded in the late 1970s; Sen. Dole
received 14 neckties from Baroness Sophie Vavlitis, of New
York, while Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.) reported he accepted a
one-person sleeper sofa valued at $1,500 from Theresa Castro,
of Ocala, Fla.
   Honoraria are paid by many different companies and
organizations. Lawmakers may pocket only $2,000 per speech.
Some groups, including Autrenet, a New York brokerage
company, invite senators to speak on two successive days, for
a total of $4,000. The Tobacco Institute, a trade association
of cigarette manufacturers, shows up repeatedly on the
disclosure forms, as does Connell Co., Westfield, N.J.
Company chairman Grover Connell, a multimillionaire commodity
merchant, said he gave $104,000 to 52 House and Senate
members last year.
   House and Senate members can donate their honoraria to
almost any nonprofit organization. Assistant House Minority
Leader Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.), for example, gave $29,304 to
the Atlanta Zoo and plans to fund a reading program in the
Georgia public schools with his 1990 honoraria.
   In general, committee chairmen and those in leadership
positions received the most speaking fees. Rep. Gingrich, who
rose to a leadership position in 1989, more than doubled his
honoraria to $67,491 last year from a 1988 level of only
$28,550. But House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) drew only
a modest $32,000 in honoraria, pocketed $27,000 and gave
$5,000 to charity.
