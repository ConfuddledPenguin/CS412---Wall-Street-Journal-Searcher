   NEW YORK -- New construction contracts fell 6% in April to
the lowest level in four years, reflecting a response to
regulatory clampdowns on high-risk real estate lending
practices.
   Nonresidential building contracts were down 12% from March
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $78.45 billion. The
value of newly started one-family homes and apartments
slipped 4% to $106.36 billion. Nonbuilding construction,
which includes public works and utilities, edged up 1% to
$45.38 billion.

   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
total U.S. construction contracts awarded in April fell to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $230.2 billion from
$245.47 billion in March. That brought the Dodge index down
to 146 from 156 the previous month. The index compares
current contracting with a 1982 base of 100.
   After a temporary rebound in March, the latest month's
setback continues a decline that began in late 1989.
Construction contract values to date this year are trailing
last year's total by 9%, on an unadjusted basis. Weakness was
evident in the four major regions, with sharpest drops in the
Northeast at 27%, followed by the South at 11%. The West was
even with last year's rates. The only improvement was in the
North Central region, which showed a 5% improvement,
according to Dodge.
   "The collapse of homebuilding in the first half of 1990,
despite workable mortgage rates, indicates a problem of
availability, rather than cost, of credit," said George A.
Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge.
