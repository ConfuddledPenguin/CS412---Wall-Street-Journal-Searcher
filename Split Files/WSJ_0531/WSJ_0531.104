   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
tapped top officials of U.S. stock and futures exchanges,
Wall Street executives and academics for a panel created to
promote the development of financial markets in Eastern
Europe.
   The Emerging Markets Advisory Committee will enable the
SEC to "respond to requests for assistance with the best
combined resources of the U.S. government and the U.S.
private sector," SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said.

   Officials in Eastern Europe have sought assistance in
securities areas, including developing disclosure and
reporting systems for their securities markets, licensing
securities professionals and establishing supervisory and
enforcement programs, the SEC said.
   The panel includes John Phelan, New York Stock Exchange
chairman; James Jones, American Stock Exchange chairman;
Joseph Hardiman, National Association of Securities Dealers
president; Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's executive committee, and Alger Chapman, Chicago
Board Options Exchange chairman.
   Also named to the committee were: Hans Angermueller,
chairman of Centrale de Livraison de Valuers Mobilieres S.A.,
a major international clearing organization; J. Michael Cook,
chairman of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche; John Opel,
chairman of the executive committee and former chairman of
International Business Machines Corp.; and William Schreyer,
chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Separately, top officials with Poland's Ministry of
Finance said that they hope to have an independent securities
regulator similar to the SEC in place by year end.
