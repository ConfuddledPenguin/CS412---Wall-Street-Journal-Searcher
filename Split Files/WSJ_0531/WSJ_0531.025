   At the close of a three-day Arab League summit in Baghdad,
Libya's Moammar Gadhafi said he had stopped attending most
such gatherings because they "amounted to nothing but a big
zero." The Baghdad summit, he conceded, "deserves to be rated
one mark above zero."
   Mr. Gadhafi's modest grade probably reflects the
evaluation of most delegates, none of whom got exactly what
he wanted from a meeting called to tackle what many Arabs
consider the threat posed by Soviet Jewish immigration to
Israel. The delegates split over how stridently they should
criticize the U.S. for backing Israel.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had hoped for
condemnation of Israel and the U.S., backed with economic
sanctions including, perhaps, a limited oil embargo.
   But such moderate voices as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd mostly prevailed, nevertheless
ending up with resolutions harsher than they would have
preferred. Mr. Mubarak, arguing against condemnation of the
U.S., said Washington was playing a constructive role in
urging talks between Israel and Palestinians, even though
that plan has been shelved during Israel's political crisis.
   The summit communique threatened punitive "political and
economic measures" against nations that recognize Jerusalem
as the capital of Israel but didn't specify what actions
would be taken. The communique also criticized the U.S.
Congress for supporting Israel's claim to Jerusalem, even
though U.S. government policy holds that Tel Aviv is the
capital of Israel.
   The summit failed to deliver to its host, Mr. Hussein, the
Arab leadership position he had hoped for. Instead, by
agreeing that annual summits would be held in Cairo beginning
in November, the gathering conferred prestige on Mr. Mubarak.
   Palestinian newspapers expressed disappointment over the
summit. Al-Fajr, an East Jerusalem paper, accused moderate
Arab leaders of "taking orders from America."
