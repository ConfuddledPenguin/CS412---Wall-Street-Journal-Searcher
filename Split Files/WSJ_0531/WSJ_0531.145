   The oil-price rally triggered by gasoline began fading,
but held on because of an expected further reduction in
supplies of motor fuel.
   But supplies aren't shrinking as fast as many oil-market
participants thought.

   Release of the industry's latest weekly oil statistics
showed an increase rather than the expected drawdown in U.S.
gasoline inventories. According to the report by the American
Petroleum Institute -- released after U.S. futures trading
closed -- gasoline inventories totaled 214.2 million barrels
as of Friday. Although that is below the 221.7 million
barrels of a year earlier, it is nearly 1.1 million barrels
higher than the level of the preceding week.
   The nation's inventories of crude oil and distillates,
which include heating oil, also gained last week by 2.1
million barrels and 737,000 barrels, respectively, according
to the API figures. But it was the level of gasoline on the
eve of the Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally marks
the beginning of the "driving season," that drew the
attention of oil-market participants.
   As a result, many traders considered the API report a
bearish signal for crude oil as well as motor fuel. Some
cited a drop of 20 cents to 25 cents a barrel in the cash
market for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude,
after the API report was released.
   The report will "take some of the momentum" out of the
market, said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy-futures
broker. Still, he said, gasoline inventories are somewhat
low. A more bearish factor, he said, was the rise in refinery
operations.
   "There was an increase of 492,000 barrels a day in
refinery runs, which means they will make more gasoline," he
said.
   Crude oil rallied in early trading yesterday on fears that
an earthquake in Romania and the southern part of the Soviet
Union might have damaged oil facilities. But there wasn't any
report of damages.
   Reports of shutdowns and other problems in some U.S.
refineries helped support crude and kept gasoline firm
through much of the day. In U.S. futures trading, July crude
broke through the technically important level of $18 a barrel
to settle at $18.08, up 10 cents. The August crude contract
was up six cents to $18.64.
   In a contra-seasonal move, heating oil also was strong.
The June and July heating-oil contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange were up 0.91 cent and 0.66 cent a gallon,
respectively.
   The really big futures price jump came in unleaded
gasoline for June delivery. Today is the last day of trading
for the June contract; yesterday it rose 1.08 cents a gallon
to settle at 66.87 cents. The July contract increased 0.3
cent to 63.26 cents.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell with the July contract
settling one cent a pound lower at $1.1150. The market opened
weak because of softness in the London market and the U.S.
Commerce Department's news that sales of new single-family
homes fell to a 546,000 annual rate in April, its lowest
level since December 1982. John Gross, publisher of the
Copper Journal, says the market has been pressured by
increasing copper stocks. Copper in New York's Commodity
Exchange warehouses rose to 14,871 tons as of Tuesday night;
stocks were as low as 2,334 tons on March 23. London Metal
Exchange warehouse stock rose to 84,988 tons on May 25 from
65,174 tons at the end of March. Mr. Gross also said a report
of an earthquake in Peru Wednesday steadied the market. He
added that the most recent housing starts figures are
anything but encouraging. "The annualized rate {of housing
starts} in April was 1.2 million units," Mr. Gross says.
"That number can be compared with an actual 1989 rate of 1.37
million units and 1.49 million units in 1988." Philip
Gotthelf, publisher of Commodity Futures Forecast, says most
technicians see copper maintaining a trading range between
$1.18 and $1.08 a pound. He adds, "I believe that a lot of
traders are just waiting for an opportunity to sell July
copper above $1.1750 on the theory that there is a lot of
overhead resistance above the contract high of $1.1925" a
pound.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn-futures contracts sank
amid forecasts that dry weather will let Midwest farmers
resume planting a crop that has been delayed by wet weather.
Corn farmers have planted 81% of their fields compared with a
normal rate of 94%. If farmers can rapidly complete planting,
their crops stand a better chance of enduring the summer. By
June, farmers avoid planting corn because the crop would
reach pollination in midsummer when it is the most vulnerable
to hot and dry weather. Some analysts doubt the dry weather
will last, however, and have begun to cut their estimates of
how many acres of corn will be planted this spring. Katharina
Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York, said the
planting delay prompted her to reduce her estimate to 75.5
million acres. Earlier this spring, she expected corn farmers
to plant about 76 million acres. Instead of corn, farmers
will probably plant other crops such as soybeans, which can
be planted into June. Planting of soybeans, however, is also
lagging. About 25% of the soybean crop is planted compared
with a normal rate of 60% by this time of the year. Prices of
soybean-futures contracts fell.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The July contract opened near
Tuesday's close and, failing to sustain any upward move, sank
to 13.53 cents a pound before closing at 13.71 cents. Mr.
Gotthelf of Commodity Futures Forecast said most of the
action was tied to a follow-through of Tuesday's selling. He
also said the U.S. must again liberalize its import quotas on
sugar to remain in accord with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. U.S. import quotas have been increased
twice. Mr. Gotthelf said bulls are using the GATT accord to
make their case. "They believe that our liberalized quotas
will knock the U.S. price to under 20 cents and bring the
world price above 16 cents" because increased U.S. use will
draw supplies from the world market. He pointed out that July
sugar was above 16 cents briefly in early May before the
market quickly backed down. Mr. Gotthelf is also sympathetic
with the views of the World Food Council, which expects
countries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to upgrade
their diet as their economies become less centralized. "I
believe that one of the first areas they will want to improve
is sweets. They will look to acquire a sweet tooth," Mr.
Gotthelf said. He also said most technical traders don't
expect July sugar to fall below the area of 13.50 cents a
pound.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The July futures contract settled at 81.13 cents a
pound, down one cent, after it rose above Tuesday's
life-of-contract high of 82.15 cents a pound. Mr. Gotthelf
said reports from Louisiana indicate that the fields are
drying out rapidly in cotton-producing regions and that flood
damage won't be as severe as first feared. "We believe that
cotton above 80 cents a pound is a very dear commodity," said
Mr. Gotthelf, who added he would be a seller above that
price. He also pointed out that recent Commerce Department
reports show that retail sales are down, which will cut
demand for cotton.
