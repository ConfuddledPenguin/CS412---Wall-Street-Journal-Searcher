   Joseph J. Pinola today ends his ill-starred 12-year tenure
as chairman and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based
First Interstate Bancorp, the nation's eighth-largest bank.
   Mr. Pinola yields his posts to Edward M. Carson, 60 years
old, who moves from president to chief executive and chairman
as of today. William Siart, 43, who has been running First
Interstate's profitable California unit, becomes president of
the parent.

   This is a bitter moment for the proud, headstrong Mr.
Pinola. Analysts and industry executives give him credit for
assembling a far-flung and potentially lucrative retail
franchise in the western U.S. But Mr. Pinola wasn't able to
capitalize on that network.
   He had visions of First Interstate dominating banking in
the West, yet at the end of his reign, he finds his
reputation as banker is tainted and his beloved company
staggered by disastrous decisions he and his subordinates
made, most notably an acquisition in Texas that has cost
First Interstate about $500 million since 1987.
   Mr. Carson has effectively been running the company since
Mr. Pinola announced his retirement in January. He has said
that he intends to rebuild the company from within,
concentrating on streamlining First Interstate's bloated cost
structure, one of the worst in banking.
