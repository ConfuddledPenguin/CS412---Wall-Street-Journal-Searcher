   DISARMING FRANCE'S POLICEMEN

   French policemen are facing the prospect of hanging up
their guns.
   Most don't need the weapons, Interior Minister Joxe
suggested during talks about proposed legislation affecting
10,000 municipal policemen. He supported his argument with
the example of London, where only 2,552 of the 26,800 police
officers are armed.
   Roger Chaix, former director of the national intelligence
service, rejected Mr. Joxe's comparison with London, saying
that "crime doesn't have the same characteristics in Britain
as in France, where unfortunately there is extremely violent
crime." According to Mr. Chaix, "the London bobby is
respected," unlike the "police of Paris, Lyon or Marseille."
   Police unions estimate that 95% of France's 80,000 armed
uniformed officers would oppose mothballing their guns.
                                                                                                       

   EC AID FOR YUGOSLAVIA
                                                                                                       

   Abel Matutes, the European Community's commissioner for
Mediterranean countries, said the 12-nation trading bloc
would be increasing loan aid to Yugoslavia and would upgrade
the current cooperation agreement between Belgrade and the EC
into an association agreement. Mr. Matutes said the next
five-year loan for Yugoslavia, from July 1, 1991, would be
900 million European currency units ($1.1 billion), almost
double the current five-year loan of 550 million ECUs.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S FEARFUL ILLEGAL WORKERS

   Thousands of illegal foreign workers in Japan have been
streaming to immigration offices to be deported after false
rumors they would be arrested under a new law that goes into
effect tomorrow. Most of the illegal workers are Pakistanis,
Malaysians and Bangladeshis. Under the new law, employers or
brokers of illegal aliens -- not the employees themselves --
face up to three years in jail.
                                                                                                       

   BANNING BRITISH BEEF
                                                                                                       

   France banned all imports of British beef to protect
against an outbreak of "mad cow" disease that has killed
thousands of British cattle. Agriculture Minister Henri
Nallet said the ban would be lifted as soon as Paris was
convinced that the British virus posed no danger to French
citizens. Austria imposed a similar ban Tuesday. The British
government says there is no evidence that the virus can
affect humans.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN INFLATION: A PROMISE
                                                                                                       

   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
inflation will be kept under a ceiling of 3% after the two
Germanys form an economic and monetary union. Addressing a
meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Mr.
Haussmann said the Deutsche Bundesbank will act to keep
inflation from exceeding that 3% ceiling. "It is clearly
defined in the state treaty {on economic and monetary union}
that money supply for the two German states will be decided
only by the Deutsche Bundesbank," he stressed. He said West
Germany's current inflation rate is 2.7%.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN DRUG CONTROLS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community's executive commission said it
planned to introduce stringent controls on trade in chemicals
used to turn plants into addictive narcotics. The 12
chemicals, mostly solvents and acids, are used to turn coca
leaves, poppies and other plants into drugs like heroin or
cocaine and are used to make synthetic drugs such as LSD. But
the chemicals are also widely used to make paint, varnish and
glue, and the commission said its proposal tried to
"reconcile the need to efficiently monitor trade in these
chemicals with the legitimate interests of legal trade."
                                                                                                       

   SPANISH NUCLEAR SHUTDOWN
                                                                                                       

   The Vandellos I nuclear-power plant in northeastern Spain
was closed permanently yesterday, throwing into doubt the
future of Spain's nuclear-energy program.
   Energy Minister Claudio Aranzadi told parliament that
repair and modernization of the plant is too great an
economic burden to "justify to the consumer." He said the
cost of restarting the power station, which was shut down
last October after a fire, would run upwards of 33 billion
pesetas ($315 million).
   While Spain's Nuclear Safety Commission determined that no
radiation leaked from the plant during the fire, the accident
sparked a storm of protest. Questions about the plant's
safety prompted the government to shut down the power
station, though few had expected the closure would be
permanent.
   "Permanently closing Vandellos clearly sends a signal that
the anti-nuclear position is gaining ground in the
government," said Jose Porta, an analyst with BSN S.A. in
Madrid. He noted that the decision implies that
Valdecaballeros nuclear-power plant in central Spain, which
is now 70% complete, isn't likely ever to see a startup.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Japanese wine lovers, usually among the first in the world
each November to sample France's Beaujolais Nouveau, will be
among the last this year. The charter flights that carry the
wine to Japan will be delayed by foreign dignitaries arriving
in Tokyo for Emperor Akihito's enthronement. . . . In South
Africa, hijackers seized a truck delivering the latest
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" tapes from Johannesburg's Jan
Smuts airport to a local television station. The station said
it would screen repeats until replacements are rushed from
New York.
