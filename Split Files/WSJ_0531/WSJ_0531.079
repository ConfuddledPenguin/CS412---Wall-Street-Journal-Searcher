   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Xerox Corp. said it put up for sale
much of its third-party financing and leasing operation,
further backing away from its financial-services business and
counterbalancing a large write-off that is said to be in the
offing.
   The businesses on the block represent about $2.2 billion,
or about 40%, of the financial assets of Xerox Credit Corp.,
Xerox's financing subsidiary. They also include $140 million
in assets in international third-party financing but don't
affect the financing of Xerox equipment or any other Xerox
finance-oriented businesses.

   Alex Henderson, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., valued the businesses for sale at between $150 million
and $300 million. Xerox couldn't be reached for comment on
its target price.
   Yesterday's announcement comes amid Xerox's recent
disillusionment with its financial-services business, which
was responsible for a $375 million first-quarter write-off
related to bad real-estate investments.
   Wall Street analysts have tied that change in corporate
attitude to the appointment of Paul Allaire, head of the
company's business-equipment arm, as successor to David
Kearns as chief executive.
   Mr. Allaire is known as a cost-cutter, and analysts say he
has sent out word that unprofitable businesses, especially in
the financial-services sector, must shape up or be sold.
   But yesterday's announcement also coincided with
speculation about another impending write-off, related to
Xerox's Crum &amp; Forster insurance unit. That speculation,
featured in an article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal,
sent Xerox shares diving $1.75 a share to close at $46.50 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "The timing obviously isn't an accident," said Mr.
Henderson. "The specter of some fairly significant write-offs
scared a lot of people, but this should compensate and put
the stock back on track."
   The announcement was made after the market closed
yesterday. Mr. Henderson said he expects Xerox shares to
rebound to previous levels on the news today. "The Street
will laud any move to sell anything in financial services,"
he said. "Anything that takes debt and liability off the
balance sheet will be viewed positively."
