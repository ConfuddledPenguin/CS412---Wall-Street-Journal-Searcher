   SEOUL, South Korea -- The current account deficit for
South Korea narrowed to $171 million in April, the smallest
in four months. A year earlier there was a surplus of $516
million, according to the Bank of Korea.
   The April deficit -- the fourth-consecutive monthly
shortfall -- was attributed to sluggish merchandise exports
and expanding imports.
