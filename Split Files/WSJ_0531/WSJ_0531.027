   PARIS -- French prosecutors asked that insider trading
charges be brought against five people, including the French
finance minister's onetime chief of staff, in connection with
a failed 1988 raid on banking company Societe Generale.
   The former chief of staff is Jean-Charles Naouri, who had
left the government and become a banker by the time of the
alleged insider trading.

   Mr. Naouri declined to comment, saying he would wait for
the judicial process to be completed. He earlier acknowledged
buying Societe Generale shares in July 1988, before the raid
was launched. He said he bought 10 million francs ($1.8
million) of the shares for the Euris investment fund that he
manages and 1.5 million francs of the shares for himself. He
said he sold the shares before the raid on the company, and
he has denied wrongdoing.
   Mr. Naouri did confirm that before he bought the shares he
was contacted by businessman Georges Pebereau, who later
orchestrated the raid. He said he turned down Mr. Pebereau's
offer of jointly investing in Societe Generale but later
decided to make the investment himself.
   The others against whom charges were sought are three
investors and the estranged wife of one of the raid's
backers.
   The Societe Generale raid became politically controversial
in France, where some viewed it as an effort backed by Mr.
Naouri's former boss, Socialist Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy, to manipulate the political composition of Societe
Generale shareholders. The insider trading allegations shook
the government and weakened Mr. Beregovoy politically.
