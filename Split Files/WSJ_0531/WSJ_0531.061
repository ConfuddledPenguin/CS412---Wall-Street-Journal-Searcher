   S.G. Warburg Group PLC, a British merchant banking and
stockbroking concern, said pretax profit for the year ended
March 31 rose 68% to #188 million ($318.4 million) from #112
million a year earlier, but warned it is unlikely to match
this performance in fiscal 1991.
   The pretax profit was below some market forecasts. Fiscal
first-half pretax profit more than doubled to #102.6 million,
largely from corporate finance activity; its pace slowed in
the second half.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests jumped 67% to
#112 million from #66.9 million, and fully diluted per-share
earnings rose 64% to 49.9 pence from 30.4 pence. Net profit
attributable to shareholders, after preference-share dividend
payments, increased 73% to #108 million from #62.5 million.
Warburg said it will recommend a final dividend of 10.5 pence
a share, raising the total payout for the year to 15 pence
from 12.5 pence.
   In its cautious fiscal 1991 forecast, Warburg cited tight
monetary policies and high real interest rates as reducing
corporate takeover activity, and low securities trading
volume.
