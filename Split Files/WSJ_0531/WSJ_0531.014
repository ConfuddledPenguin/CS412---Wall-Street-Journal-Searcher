   NASHUA CORP. said that based on a preliminary count for
its previously announced Dutch auction, self-tender offer, it
plans to buy about 2.79 million shares of its common stock at
$40.50 a share in cash. The shares represent about 32% of the
Nashua, N.H., coated-paper products and office-supplies
concern's outstanding shares. The company said the offer was
oversubscribed.
