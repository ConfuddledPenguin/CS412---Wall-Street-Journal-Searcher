   Another first takes place tomorrow in the long-awaited
transformation of the U.S. market for privately placed
securities.
   An international stock offering for Atlas Copco AB, a
Swedish industrial and construction equipment company, closes
tomorrow. Investment bankers say it is the first stock
offering under the Securities and Exchange Commission's new
Rule 144a, which is designed to ease trading of privately
placed securities in the U.S. by exempting billions of
dollars in new offerings from U.S. disclosure rules.

   Last month the SEC passed the new 144a rule, which is
expected to benefit big institutional investors but not small
investors. The new rule allows certain large U.S.
institutions to sell and trade private-placement securities
without having to fill out extensive financial disclosure
forms. The new rule is meant to draw foreign companies and
sovereigns to the U.S. markets to raise capital.
   Bankers said Atlas Copco last week placed a 1.3 billion
Swedish kronor ($214 million) offering that was
oversubscribed, with 23% of the offering -- or about $50
million of common stock -- placed in the U.S. under the new
Rule 144a. Lead manager of the issue was Enskilda Securities,
a London-based unit of Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken. CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit headed
a regional syndicate for North America.
   The Atlas Copco offering is the first stock deal under
Rule 144a, investment bankers said, but it isn't the first
overall. A $100 million bond offering under Rule 144a for
British Aerospace closed May 14; investment bankers led by
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. completed that transaction.
   Elsewhere on the 144a front, Salomon Inc.'s Salomon
Brothers Inc. is in the process of completing a large 144a
bond transaction for Union Tank Car Co.
   A CS First Boston spokesman declined to comment on the
Atlas Copco deal yesterday, citing regulatory restrictions
against public comment until the transaction closes.
   While some kinks remain in the procedures for bringing
such deals to market, the Atlas Copco offering is seen as a
successful maiden test for 144a-related stock offerings,
investment bankers said. Non-U.S. companies have shied from
U.S. markets because of SEC disclosure rules. Rule 144a
enabled Atlas Copco to avoid the extra paperwork. "We made no
changes to the offering circular that was distributed in
Europe other than stamping in red letters, `It's a 144a
transaction,'" said one securities executive.
