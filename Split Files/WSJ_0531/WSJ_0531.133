   Have Lunch,' and Really Mean It

   Genevieve McLaughlin plans to retire tomorrow from
Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, but her employer
won't let her go without a luncheon.
   Ms. McLaughlin, a Blue Cross employee since 1971, doesn't
want one of the company's traditional farewell fetes. She
says she'd rather steer the $1,200 that would be spent on it
to a worthy cause.

   "I grew up in poverty and worked to put my four children
through school," says Ms. McLaughlin, a 64-year-old claims
examiner. Her retirement, she says, means a "chance to help
someone else with a substantial amount of money."
   But Independence Blue Cross, skittish at being caught
without a policy guideline on the issue, insists on going
ahead with a luncheon at a local hotel. These affairs,
attended by up to 35 colleagues and a handful of managers,
include flowers, photos and a $100 gift certificate for the
retiree.
   Three years ago, when Ms. McLaughlin first broached the
idea of a donation, it was greeted with a smile and quietly
swept under the rug, she says. Unyielding, she told Blue
Cross two months ago that she has no intention of attending
the company luncheon when she retires.
   Independence Blue Cross, which has two million subscribers
in southeastern Pennsylvania, then formed a six-member
advisory group to ponder the propriety of her charitable
urges. A Blue Cross spokeswoman says the group has drafted a
recommendation, which remains secret. The panel is awaiting
comments from the company's senior management council, after
which it will draw up a final plan. The spokeswoman predicts
any change will be adopted in less than a year.
   In the meantime, company officials have urged Ms.
McLaughlin to settle for the luncheon and let the policy
group's decision benefit those who retire after her, if
that's how they decide.
   But Ms. McLaughlin says her closest friends and office
mates have already thrown a little party for her; anything
more, she figures, would be a waste. And she questions the
value of having a luncheon with drinking and canned speeches
by people who have passed her in the hallway for years
without saying a word.
   Ms. McLaughlin is convinced that others share her
conviction. "I know of two people in particular who want
their {retirement luncheon} money to go to hospices," she
says. If she has her druthers, she says, she'll split the
$1,200 between a local hospice and a little league.
