   LTV Corp. said it hasn't had any further talks with Usinor
Sacilor about a transaction involving the Dallas company's
steel unit.
   An LTV spokesman said that David Hoag, president of LTV
Steel Co., said at the American Iron and Steel Institute
meeting that discussions hadn't been held with Usinor, a
French steelmaker, since the two said they were talking in
late March.

   At the time, LTV said that Usinor had indicated it was
interested in buying part of LTV's steel operations and said
that the two were working on confidentiality agreements.
   The LTV spokesman said he couldn't elaborate on Mr. Hoag's
remarks.
   LTV, the U.S.'s third-largest steelmaker, is operating
under federal bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
