   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- In another shake-up at McDonnell
Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft division here, the company
named two executives to oversee its troubled C-17 military
cargo plane program for the Air Force.
   John P. Capellupo, 55 years old, deputy president of
Douglas Aircraft, was named to the additional post of interim
program manager for the C-17 program. He succeeds Robert
Clepper, who has taken "a medical leave of absence," Douglas
said. Messrs. Capellupo and Clepper couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Mr. Capellupo was appointed deputy president of Douglas
Aircraft in January in a move to help shore up performance on
several major transport aircraft programs. He previously had
served as president of McDonnell Douglas's missile-systems
subsidiary.
   The company also named Leonard F. Impellizzeri, 51, staff
vice president for engineering and advanced systems at
McDonnell Douglas's corporate headquarters in St. Louis, as
vice president-deputy general manager for the C-17. He joins
Jack Hayden, who was named to the same post last August. Mr.
Impellizzeri will oversee engineering aspects of the C-17
program, while Mr. Hayden will continue to direct
manufacturing operations.
   "The C-17 has to be the area of greatest concern for
Douglas, because if the cost goes over the ceiling price it
would have a detrimental impact on Douglas's financials,"
said Lawrence M. Harris, an aerospace analyst with Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. Douglas took a $72
million charge in the second quarter last year to reflect
cost overruns on the program.
   The contract for the C-17 is a so-called fixed-price
incentive contract, under which the company and the
government share in any cost increases up to a certain
ceiling, with the government assuming the larger share, about
80%, Mr. Harris explained. However, once the increases hit
the ceiling, around $4.8 billion, the contract reverts to a
firm fixed-price contract under which the company must absorb
the cost overruns, he said. "Right now, Douglas is at or near
the ceiling on the full-scale development portion of the
program."
   The executive changes on the C-17 program are just the
latest in a series of shake-ups here that began last year,
when Douglas eliminated four of nine management levels and
forced all managers to reapply for their own jobs.
