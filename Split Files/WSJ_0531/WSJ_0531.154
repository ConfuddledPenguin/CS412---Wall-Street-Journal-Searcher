   CHRYSLER IS LOSING its vice-chairman, Gerald Greenwald,
who has agreed to lead the UAL buyout effort by United Air's
unions. The move is a big boost for the airline's unions,
whose buy-out depends partly on a strong candidate to replace
UAL Chairman Wolf. But Greenwald's departure is a further
blow to Chrysler.

the optimistic outlook suggested by a 1% rise in March. Also,
new-home sales slid 1.6% in April, the fifth drop in a row.
   New construction contracts fell 6% in April to a four-year
low, F.W. Dodge said. The decline reflects the recent
regulatory clampdown on high-risk real-estate lending.

   Stock prices climbed further in heavier volume, pushing
the Dow Jones industrials up 8.07, to 2878.56, another
record. The S&amp;P 500 index also set a record. Many investors
remained puzzled by the market's advance amid weak economic
data. Bonds and the dollar also rose.

   Portfolio insurance has returned in a new guise,
"portfolio puts," which threatens to turn market drops into
huge declines. The SEC is taking a hard look at the new
version of the trading strategy, which helped exacerbate the

remain bearish.

   Canada's Belzberg family sold its entire 11.7% interest in
Armstrong World Industries at a loss estimated at as much as
$18 million. The abrupt sale ends a year-long losing battle
to bring about a takeover or otherwise influence the
company's direction.

   A growing U.S.-EC dispute over agriculture subsidies has
complicated efforts to advance the current round of world
trade-liberalization talks. The disagreement also could
torpedo the GATT negotiations completely.

mismanagement and waste in the European Community's $33
billion farm-subsidy program.
