   Harnischfeger Industries Inc., Milwaukee, said it plans to
buy shares in Measurex Corp., in a move it says will
"strengthen the existing relationship" between its 80%-owned
Beloit unit and Measurex.
   Harnischfeger isn't obliged under the agreement to
purchase any shares, but said it had agreed not to exceed a
20% Measurex stake through its purchases. Harnischfeger
produces construction equipment and industrial machinery.
Beloit makes equipment for the paper industry.

   Measurex, a Cupertino, Calif., maker of industrial
process-control systems, has about 17.8 million common shares
outstanding.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Measurex shares climbed $2.25 to close at $21.875.
   Additionally, Harnischfeger said, Beloit and Measurex
entered into a joint marketing, sales and development
agreement which expands an existing 1987 agreement to cover
additional products.
   As part of the link between the companies, Harnischfeger's
chairman and chief executive officer William W. Goessel, will
join Measurex's board, increasing membership to eight.
