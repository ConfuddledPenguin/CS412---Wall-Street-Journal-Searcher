   LAPEER, Mich. -- Durakon Industries Inc. said it agreed to
sell its DFM Corp. bug and gravel-deflector shields
subsidiary to a private investor company that Durakon
wouldn't identify.
   The stock purchase agreement calls for the payment of
$12.5 million in cash at the closing and the receipt by
Durakon of a warrant to buy stock of the parent company of
the purchaser.
