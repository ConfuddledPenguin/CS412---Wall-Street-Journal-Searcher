   BEIJING -- During the early hours of last June 4, as the
Beijing night resounded with gunfire, a skinny, bespectacled
Chinese rock star named Hou Dejian suddenly found himself
center stage in a tense political drama.
   Chinese troops had just shot their way through thick
crowds of pro-democracy demonstrators, killing hundreds of
civilians and wounding thousands more. When they reached
Tiananmen Square, the soldiers turned their sights on the
several hundred student protesters who had vowed to stand
their ground.

   To avoid further bloodshed, Mr. Hou, who had joined
Tiananmen protesters in a hunger strike a day earlier, helped
persuade the students to give up their suicidal course. Then,
trembling, he approached the commanding military officers and
negotiated the students' peaceful retreat. It was one of the
few cool-headed acts in a night full of terror and despair.
   For Mr. Hou (pronounced Ho), the massacre was a turning
point. Today, a year later, he has given up his performing
career and become a full-time dissident. Indeed, he is
China's No. 1 dissenter -- the only person in this vast
nation of 1.1 billion who regularly utters in public the
criticisms of the state that many Chinese share but dare not
speak.
   "I don't like being a professional dissident. I would
prefer to be a musician," says the 33-year-old Mr. Hou. "But
June 4 changed everyone. Today, if I keep quiet, nobody will
talk."
   It isn't surprising that Mr. Hou's candor is highly prized
by the foreign reporters in Beijing. They have had little
access to the Chinese people in the repressive period since
the massacre. Last August, when he emerged from the
Australian Embassy after 72 days' refuge there, Mr. Hou was
beset by reporters. Now, as journalists work on their stories
about the first anniversary of Tiananmen Square, they are
beating on his door again. He has been interviewed by ABC,
CBS, NBC and CNN, plus a slew of print journalists. "He's the
only real interview in town," says Andrew Higgins, Beijing
correspondent for the Independent, a British daily.
   Mr. Hou doesn't exactly fit the stereotype of a dissident:
He is no rumpled intellectual surrounded by books and
absorbed in thought.
   He still lives like the rock star he was. He sleeps past
noon most days, then goes to a hotel to while away his
afternoons playing pool. He drives there in the maroon 1987
Mercedes-Benz that he spent $40,000 to import. After a few
games of snooker, he relaxes in the hotel sauna before
heading out for the evening.
   Mr. Hou receives visitors in his studio, which is the
converted half of a two-car garage, certainly one of the few
two-car garages in all of China. (His three-room apartment is
nearby.) The studio is full of gadgets: an electric piano,
expensive stereo, even a sound-activated, dancing plastic
flower. Mr. Hou lives on royalties from the records he made
in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and he still gets a salary check
each month from his official employer, the Guangzhou Culture
Hall, though he hasn't worked there in more than a year. (He
still gets paid because this is China. Once you are assigned
to a "work unit," you belong to it, even when conditions
change drastically. Virtually no one is fired, and he hasn't
quit. So, they keep paying him.)
   Sitting with guests, Mr. Hou balances an Ovation guitar on
his knee. And between observations on the Chinese political
scene, he will pick a quick blues riff. "My favorite musician
is B.B. King," he says, in his accented but colloquial
English. "Since June 4, I've learned to understand the blues.
It's about facing reality. When you sing, you can't hide
yourself in your voice."
   Despite his privileged life style, Mr. Hou has the respect
of many of China's cowed intellectuals for his willingness to
risk everything he has, including his freedom, by speaking
for the politically oppressed. His fame and his background --
in 1983, he became one of the few Taiwan-born Chinese to
defect to China -- offer him some protection, but his words
may yet land him in prison.
   For the time being, the state tolerates his outbursts,
perhaps to give the impression that China allows dissent.
Police recently stopped tailing his car, and authorities no
longer force him to report his contacts with the foreign
press. With this leeway, Mr. Hou thrives on tweaking the
Communist Party hierarchy.
   His most satisfying moment came on Jan. 26, when officials
of the United Front Department, a Party organization that has
contact with overseas Chinese, invited him to attend a New
Year's party. He was asked to sing and play for the
gathering.
   If his hosts expected something innocuous, they were
mistaken. Mr. Hou took advantage of the opportunity to
deliver a public affront to the party elite. He announced he
would perform "The Beautiful Chinese," a song he wrote to
honor the heroic students and workers who took part in last
year's democracy movement, which has been officially
dismissed as a counter-revolutionary rebellion.
   Here are some sample lyrics:
   My friends who love freedom, let's open
    our wings and fly.
   Listen carefully -- so that no one can
    lie to us again.
   Watch carefully -- so that no one can
    twist the truth again.
   When he finished the song, a couple of people in the big
Beijing banquet hall started to applaud, then abruptly
stopped amid the surrounding silence. Mr. Hou slipped back
into his seat, neither humiliated nor chastened. "They
haven't invited me to any parties since then," he says,
smiling broadly.
   As he is recounting the story, the lights in his studio
suddenly go out. The room is completely dark, but for the
ember of the Kent he is smoking. Not to worry. Deng Xiaoping
isn't listening in and cutting off the juice. It's just a
simple power outage in energy-starved Beijing.
   Mr. Hou does believe that Mr. Deng, China's elderly
paramount leader, personally ordered the troops to open fire
on demonstrators last June 3 and 4.
   "Deng was really the only killer," says Mr. Hou. "Yang
Shangkun doesn't have enough power, and Li Peng is too
stupid." (Mr. Yang is China's president; Mr. Li is premier.)
   On the other hand, Mr. Hou says, the Chinese should blame
last year's tragedy on the political system, not on
individuals. "The `devil chair' makes everyone the devil, no
matter who they are," he says. "Even if I sat in it, I
couldn't help but become the devil."
   Mr. Hou hasn't stopped in Tiananmen Square since June 4,
though he has zoomed by in his Mercedes many times. He urges
Chinese to stay away from the potently symbolic square,
particularly on heavily freighted occasions like the
anniversary of the massacre.
   "I'm not sure if the mad dogs are still mad," he says. "My
suggestion is to keep a safe distance from the mad dogs if
you ain't got a heavy stick."
   Though he says he is still "filled with anger and hate,"
Mr. Hou also sees some faint signs of progress in China. He
was pleased about the release this month of 211 people
arrested after June 4 for participating in the pro-democracy
movement. That, and other indications of a political
softening, he believes, are a direct result of economic
pressure from the U.S. and other Western nations that imposed
sanctions after the massacre.
   "Things are beginning to change for the better," he says.
"It isn't as much as we might have hoped for, but it's a
start. Everyone should try to encourage this kind of change."
   Even Mr. Hou's solitary life as a dissident may soon
become less lonely. Two of those released from jail, Zhou Duo
and Gao Xin, are close friends of his. They were with him on
the hunger strike before troops stormed Tiananmen. The trio
plans to speak out on political issues, beginning with a
joint statement. "Together, the three of us can make a bigger
noise than I alone," Mr. Hou says.
   Mr. Hou isn't sure, however, how much longer he will play
the part of a dissident. At the moment he doesn't know what
else to do. Authorities have approved his application to
leave the country, but he has lost the reason he had to go.
His wife of four years, who had been living in Australia,
recently jilted him for another man, another of China's
political celebrities: Wuerkaixi, a handsome, charismatic and
rather flaky student leader who fled to the West after the
massacre.
   So Hou Dejian, lonely dissident, remains in Beijing,
shooting pool and taking potshots at the government.
