   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- First American Corp., struggling with
problem loans, dismissed its chairman, president and chief
executive officer, Kenneth L. Roberts.
   The banking company said James F. Smith Jr., 60 years old,
currently vice chairman, will fill Mr. Roberts' positions
until a successor can be found.

   Problems at First American, which has seen its earnings
fall drastically in recent quarters, reached a head three
weeks ago when the company posted a loss of $44.8 million, or
$1.94 a share, for the first quarter, compared with net
income of $15.4 million, or 67 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. The loss, the company said, stemmed from
a $94.4 million provision for possible loan losses after net
charge-offs of $60.8 million of loans, primarily related to
real estate.
   The results prompted First American to eliminate its
dividend for the second quarter of this year.
   First American said Mr. Roberts was dismissed by "mutual
agreement" between himself and the board. Neil Cunningham,
executive vice president, said the departure "obviously" was
connected to First American's recent performance, but he
declined to comment further.
   Mr. Roberts, 57, couldn't be reached for comment. He
joined First American in 1976, and was named chairman and
chief executive in 1979.
   He is the second top executive to leave First American
during the past year. In August, the company's president and
chief operating officer, Andrew Higgins, resigned. While no
reason was given for his departure, it coincided with a major
revision downward in second-quarter earnings. At the time,
Mr. Roberts assumed the position of president.
   Mr. Roberts' dismissal "wasn't surprising, given recent
developments at First American," said Henry J. Coffey Jr., an
analyst at J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. in Nashville. Added Jon Burke
at Robinson Humphrey Co. in Atlanta: "It was a hard decision,
but it appears to be the right one."
