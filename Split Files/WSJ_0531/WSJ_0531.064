   PITTSBURGH -- Paul E. Lego, Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
newly designated chief executive officer, is setting
ambitious goals.
   The 60-year-old president, who succeeds Chairman John C.
Marous Jr. in the No. 1 job effective July 1, said he expects
the company's profit and revenue to double "long before the
end of the decade." Last year, the company earned $922
million, or $6.31 a share, on revenue of $12.8 billion.

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Westinghouse closed at $35, down 62.5 cents.
   "We will be a great company. We are very close to being
that right now," Mr. Lego said in his first interview since
being named to the job. He expects the company to continue to
have a return on equity in the 18% to 21% range. Corporate
revenues, meanwhile, should continue to grow at least 8.5%
annually.
   Some of that growth will clearly come from acquisitions.
The executive noted, though, that while he doesn't rule out
blockbuster acquisitions entirely, he would prefer smaller
ones, in the $250 million to $500 million range. Mr. Lego
also said Westinghouse won't make acquisitions outside its
present portfolio of financial-service, broadcasting and
diversified-manufacturing businesses.
   Specifically, the executive said he wants to supplement
Westinghouse's existing businesses in air-traffic control
equipment as well as the production of news and entertainment
programming that can be aired both in the U.S. and overseas.
   He said he'd be "tickled to death" to acquire a company
involved in international air-traffic control, which would
enhance Westinghouse's Electronic Systems Group. That unit
has been trying to expand its presence in the commercial
sector in the face of likely cutbacks in military spending.
   Citing legal constraints, Mr. Lego declined to comment on
rumors that Westinghouse might be interested in making a bid
for Sundstrand Corp., an aerospace parts maker based in
Rockford, Ill. However, he cast doubt on the likelihood of a
bid, mainly because Sundstrand probably would cost more than
$2 billion, and therefore would dilute earnings.
   He acknowledged that Westinghouse's growth path "scares"
some people who follow the company because they fear it will
make poor acquisitions. But he said Westinghouse is picky and
has already screened "thousands of companies" as possible
acquisition candidates. "We're very controlled," he said,
reflecting his own analytical temperament. Confident and
intense, Mr. Lego, is the son of a steelworker and joined
Westinghouse in 1956 as an electrical engineer.
   Increasing the company's revenue, however, "is an
imperative," he said. In recent years the company has
divested underperforming assets that produced about $1
billion of revenue and Westinghouse now wants to replace that
revenue, he said.
   As for future succession at Westinghouse, Mr. Lego clearly
wants to establish a horse race for the No. 2 job. The
executive said he would continue to carry the president's
title for several years. The several possible presidential
candidates, he said, need additional "seasoning" before they
are ready to succeed him.
