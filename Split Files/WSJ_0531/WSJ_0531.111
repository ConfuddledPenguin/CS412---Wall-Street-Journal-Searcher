   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it will take a
$126.5 million charge to pare down its securities brokerage
division, in what analysts said was a belated recognition of
problems.
   The second-quarter after-tax charge will include $108.5
million to write down good will and other intangible assets
of the company's brokerage operations and $18 million to pay
for layoffs and trimming costs. In the year-ago quarter,
Kemper had net income of $121.7 million, or $2.46 a share,
including $67.2 million in profit from discontinued
operations.

   Kemper wouldn't forecast this year's second-quarter
results.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Kemper climbed $1.375, to $39; analysts said the rise
reflected investor sentiment that Kemper had moved to address
the problems of its brokerage operations.
   The charge was widely viewed as an overdue effort by the
insurance and financial services company to improve the
performance of its regional brokerage concerns.
   "We could have restructured sooner, but we believe that
this plan is adequate to get the brokers in a stronger
competitive position," said John Fitzpatrick, Kemper's chief
financial officer.
   Kemper acquired most of its regional securities concerns
in the past decade at relatively steep prices. The brokerage
business was itself attractive at the time, and Kemper viewed
the units as sales outlets for its mutual funds and other
financial services.
   "The price was high, but not excessive," Mr. Fitzpatrick
said. "We paid an entry price for regional broker
dealerships, which at the time were disappearing off the face
of the Earth."
   Since then, Kemper has been struggling to reduce the
operations' costs and improve their performance.
   "They went into the business with a strategic plan that
made sense to them, but the entire concept of diversified
financial services has been changing over the last several
years," said Carol Manning, analyst for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. "Brokerages have less value today."
   The charge comes just two months after David B. Mathis,
former head of Kemper's insurance operations, edged out
Thomas R. Anderson, president and chief executive officer of
the financial unit, for the chief operating job of the parent
company.
   Earlier this month, Kemper was hit with a $38.2 million
arbitration award to a former employee in a contract dispute.
Though it is appealing the award, the company has taken a
second-quarter after-tax charge of $19.5 million to cover the
award, in addition to the $126.5 million for restructuring.
   Kemper said the staff cuts and restructuring will bring
annual after-tax savings of more than $30 million, once the
plan is completed in 1991.
   The company intends to lay off 600 employees at the
regional brokerage operations, a cut of about 12%, and
increase its authorized common stock buy-back program to 2.5
million shares from two million shares.
   The restructuring plan also calls for centralizing risk
management and consolidating back office functions at the
broker firms Kemper owns.
   "These steps should be a positive to those who look at
cash flow, the competitive position of businesses and control
of risk," Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
