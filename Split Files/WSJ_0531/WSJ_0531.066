   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell
18% to 430,216 units in April from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
   The year-to-year decline was the sharpest since December
1986, when vehicle exports fell 17.8% year-to-year, according
to the association.

   A sharp drop in exports to the U.S., the largest importer
of Japanese vehicles, and a decline in exports by Toyota
Motor Corp., the nation's top car exporter, contributed to
the fall in the overall exports, an official at the
association said.
   The slowdown of exports to the U.S. should be seen as a
trend due to declining demand and continuing expansion of
production in the U.S. by Japanese car makers, the official
said.
