   MADRID -- Spain's current international payments account
deficit widened sharply in April to 155.3 billion pesetas
($1.49 billion) from 81.1 billion pesetas a year earlier, the
Bank of Spain reported.
   The central bank said a sharp drop in foreign capital
investment, which fell to 84 billion pesetas from 193 billion
pesetas in April 1989, was the major reason for the marked
deterioration in the current account deficit. The current
account includes trade in goods and services, plus some
unilateral transfers.
