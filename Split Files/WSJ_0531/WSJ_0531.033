   CHICAGO -- Bally Manufacturing Corp. offered to exchange a
more than 20% stake in the gambling and health-club concern
to retire a four-year-old, $135 million issue of junk bonds.
   The move is what Bally called a "first step" toward
shoring up its heavily leveraged balance sheet and improving
its stock price. Bally said it also is considering a variety
of asset sales, refinancings, joint ventures and other
measures.

   The bonds, sold through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
January 1986, have been trading at about 53 cents to 55 cents
on the dollar, Paul Johnson, Bally's chief financial officer,
said. Bally offered 57 shares of its common stock for each
$1,000 bond, or a total of about 7.7 million newly issued
shares if all the bonds are tendered. The company currently
has about 28 million shares outstanding.
   Bally's stock tumbled $1.50 yesterday on the news to close
at $10.625 in Big Board trading.
   Despite greatly increasingly the number of shares
outstanding, Bally said the equity-for-debt swap would
increase per-share profit by reducing the company's debt
load. The bonds, due January 2001, pay 13 5/8% interest, and
are the company's costliest debt.
   Bally had first-quarter profit of $7.6 million, or 21
cents a share, compared with $11.8 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was $551.3 million compared
with $516.7 million. The company wouldn't project future 1990
results or say how much per-share net would be increased by
the exchange.
   In all, Bally has about $1.77 billion of long-term debt,
Mr. Johnson said, and its 1989 interest expense was $206
million. "The market perception is that we had too much
debt," he said.
   Bally joins some other junk-bond issuers in trying to buy
back its debt at a deep discount to the original price. Mr.
Johnson said, however, that since the company is under no
financial pressure to retire the bonds, it wouldn't sweeten
the offer. "It's terribly unlikely we would do anything
else," he said.
