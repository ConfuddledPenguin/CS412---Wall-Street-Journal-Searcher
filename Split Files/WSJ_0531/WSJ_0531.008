   I want to express sincere appreciation for Brent Bower's
May 2 page-one article, "Slow Death: Life With Alzheimer's Is
Often the Hardest on Families of the Sick."
   It was an exceptionally fine job of presenting the
devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease and the enormous
emotional and financial burdens carried by the family members
who care for the patient at home.
