   Let us start with a self-evident proposition. What matters
most when you face a new situation or perplexing problem is
not the identity of the people who come up with a solution,
nor the "correctness" of its ideological underpinnings, but
the fact of the solution itself.
   Add a second proposition. The U.S. faces a dramatically
new situation abroad and a large handful of seemingly
intractable problems at home.

   Put the two together and you come up with a third
proposition. There is a tremendous political payoff for
anyone who manufactures a package of workable ideas for
refashioning American domestic and foreign policies over the
next decade.
   All of this is a truism, you say. But it is a truism that
does not seem to have led enough people to draw the
appropriate conclusions as of this late spring. The need for
agonizing reappraisals is much discussed. Actual
reappraisals, and subsequent political repositioning, are
rare.
   There is some ferment. On the right, which has held a
near-monopoly on intellectual vigor and muscular politics (if
not intelligent policies) for almost 20 years, there is a
growing call for new thinking. High priests of the Cold War
say it is time to close the temple and worship new gods.
While this threatens schism -- old believers still being in
the majority among conservatives and visceral anti-communism
not easily abandoned -- what is noteworthy is that the debate
is fully joined.
   So, too, is the debate among conservatives on how to
confront the unavoidable realities of persistent poverty,
anemic public education, a tattered social safety net and
environmental degradation. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
half partisan Cro-Magnon, half brilliant strategist, keeps
machine-gunning ideas at the GOP and the nation in the hope
that some will take. In a satellite TV show the other day, he
highlighted a smorgasbord of ideas on how to apply local
answers to social problems. Former Rep. Jack Kemp, now HUD
secretary, suggests a mix of activist government and less
government. Right-wing think tanks are mass-producing
manifestoes and "new paradigms" beyond count.
   On the left, creative thinkers from Cambridge to
California are writing scores of books designed to move the
nation into a new progressive era. Individual Democrats in
Congress offer pieces of a new approach, some of them
startling in innovation and complexity. Sen. Daniel Moynihan
(D., N.Y.) makes an offer no liberal should be able to refuse
when it comes to cutting Social Security taxes. Profoundly
revolutionary proposals for creating a peace dividend of
immediate impact and breathtaking scope have been tabled, all
requiring that our defense establishment be downsized to
reflect more accurately the substantially reduced
international threat.
   But for all the verbal fireworks and press-release gloss,
monographs and mass mailings, little is actually happening.
It seems even less when compared with the bumper crop of
change and difficulties being harvested inside and outside
U.S. borders. While yeasty ferment is a good sign, bubbles
alone won't do. There must be translation into concrete
programs.
   Examine for a moment the rationale for new thinking and
policies. The revolution and disintegration that have
imploded the Soviet empire and undermined the stability of
the Soviet state are major realities of our time. Another
major reality is the re-emergence of a truly competitive
international economic system, (say the words Japan and
Europe), coupled with growing disparities in the economic
health of the haves and have-nots of the world.
   And here at home there is a neck-and-neck race to see
whose pet ideological theories will turn out to have been
most disastrously wrong. To offer but a handful of the
possible illustrations, there are the squalid shambles of HUD
and the financial black hole created by the savings-and-loan
scandal to prove that government regulation and oversight are
the sine qua non of the good society in the modern industrial
world. Political fecklessness and failed economic theories
have created an explosion of public debt and a long string of
thus-far intransigent deficits, with enough blame to go
around several times over. Each day's headlines bring new
indicators of trouble. This week's included the declining
financial relevance of private pension plans, once hailed as
the nongovernmental alternative to Social Security.
   But in Washington, there is a collective failure to act on
the basis of changed circumstances. It's politics pretty much
as usual. Amid the throaty roars of change, what are
noteworthy are the dogs that have not barked. Intellectual
and political arteriosclerosis seems to have set in,
occasional spasms of production such as the Clean Air Act to
the contrary.
   Consider the Bush administration's approach. When
initially confronted, deny anything has really changed. Then
grudgingly begin to admit something is different. Next,
having acknowledged the nature of change in let us say,
Mikhail Gorbachev's U.S.S.R. or the federal budgetary
situation, claim there is no need for radical alteration in
defense or tax policy. Finally, tiptoe into a new stance with
one leg while straddling the old one with the other.
   As for the Democrats, their problem is that their most
articulate voices find little resonance on Capitol Hill. The
party's congressional wing achieves consensus most often with
patchwork quilts that cover almost every interest but have no
discernible design. There is no overarching theory or set of
common goals around which the party unites or toward which it
aims.
   Conservatives are fond of saying there are no new ideas.
Perhaps, but a combination of old ideas offered with new
intensity would make sense for the Democrats -- or a new
party. It would stress the creation of what a spokesman for
the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce
recently referred to as Germany's "social marketplace
economy." How the objectives were achieved would matter less
than their achievement. The Three E's -- environment,
education and equity -- would be treated as basic to national
security. So would universal health insurance, common to
every other industrial democracy. National tax policy would
be progressive in fact, rather than regressive as it now is
in overall impact.
   The military defense component of national security would
finally be placed within parameters of clearly defined
mission and unexaggerated threat all within the context of a
community of nations infinitely better able to defend
themselves than 30 years ago. Recognizing that
interdependence is an unavoidable reality on most matters,
whether environmental, military or economic, Washington would
recommit itself to breathing new life into existing
international organizations.
   All of this is as familiar as it sounds. It is the stuff
of which the democratic left has historically been made, but
from which it has been steadily retreating. The time has come
to reassert the tradition with imagination and persistence.
The conservatives are already in the field. Taking the long
view, it hardly matters which side wins, so long as the
winner is committed to engaging the world and nation as they
are and proposing solutions to what is there. What would be
unforgivable, and possibly disastrous, would be to allow
today's drift to become tomorrow's inertia.
