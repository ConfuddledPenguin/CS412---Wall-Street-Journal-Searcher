   Tokyo stocks bounced back from early arbitrage selling
pressure to close firmer on average volume.
   Traders said buying of domestic demand-related issues, as
well as some arbitrage buying, buoyed the key index back from
early losses.

   Meanwhile, British stocks surged, boosted by the rising
Dow Jones Industrial Average and new optimism about the U.K.
economy and the Conservative government's prospects.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 108.59 points to
32926.26. The index fell 373.94 points Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 227.34 points to
close the morning session at 33153.60.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
800 million shares, down from 825 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outpaced decliners 511 to 414, while 197 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which fell 22.39 points Tuesday, added 5.43
points, or 0.23%, to 2417.09.
   The second section index advanced 15.95 points, or 0.41%,
to 3902.32, after gaining 1.99 points Tuesday. Volume was
estimated at 15 million shares, down from 16.4 million shares
Tuesday.
   "The market was buffeted by arbitrage all day," noted one
trader at a foreign securities firm.
   But although stock prices fluctuated a fair amount
yesterday because of trading linked to futures and cash
indexes by domestic and foreign arbitragers, the market
ultimately was trading on fundamentals, observers said.
   The Nikkei Index closely mirrored the currency's
movements, falling early in the morning with a softer yen and
recovering later when the yen firmed slightly against the
dollar, one equity analyst at a U.S. investment trust bank
said.
   The market evidently is becoming two-tiered, with
blue-chip electricals rising on yen weakness and domestic
demand-linked shares rising on yen strength, the investment
trust bank's analyst said.
   "The (equity) market is a hostage of the currency market:
As the dollar strengthens, the index falls but high-techs
tend to get stronger, and vice versa when the dollar
weakens," he said.
   Yesterday's buying sentiment was also boosted by a
slightly firmer bond market and various rumors about domestic
demand-linked issues, traders said.
   Environmental-control stocks received steady buying,
focusing on a local economic newspaper's report that 15 types
of chlorofluorocarbons may be restricted by the year 2000.
   Ebara, which has been actively traded in the past week,
rose 80 yen to 2200 yen (53 cents to $14.57).
   Construction stocks continued to be bought as well,
boosted by an article in a Japanese newspaper that said these
companies are likely to post double-digit growth in the
current fiscal year.
   Very favorable earnings, which have persisted in
attracting buyers in the sector, have been posted over the
past few days by several construction firms for fiscal 1990.
   Also yesterday, an unconfirmed rumor that Sumitomo Mining
has discovered a high-yielding gold find in Japan's Kagoshima
Prefecture was enough to ignite buying throughout the sector,
one trader at a leading foreign securities firm said.
   On the other hand, blue-chip electrical shares were lower,
lacking any inspiring news to hold them up against
profit-taking, observers said.
   Chiyoda Corp. rose 150 yen to 2690 yen. An article in an
economic newspaper said the plant engineering company
received a large order from a European buyer.
   Among mining stocks, Dowa rose 20 yen to 1000 yen, Mitsui
added 80 yen to 1200 yen, Nippon gained 60 yen to 1070 yen,
and Sumitomo rose 90 yen to 1650 yen.
   Construction stocks included Taisei Corp., up 40 yen to
1420 yen, Ohbayashi, up 30 yen to 1740 yen, and Kajima, up 50
yen at 1970 yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index gained 50.6 points to 2346.20, just one point below its
high for the day. Only four of the 100 stocks listed in the
index fell during the day, with four others unchanged.
   Traders and analysts said Wall Street's strong showing
Tuesday and early yesterday was the major impetus for the
London gain. But they said the British market also was driven
by domestic factors, such as the possibility that early full
membership in the European Monetary System could lower U.K.
interest rates and bolster sterling.
   "What we're seeing is a general rehabilitation of the U.K.
market," said George Hodgson, U.K. strategist for S.G.
Warburg Group, a U.K. stock brokerage firm. "People who were
pouring their money overseas realized our market was looking
cheap."
   The market shrugged off a statement yesterday by British
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major that interest rates
could rise. Analysts said base rates should fall by the end
of the year. Traders also responded favorably to recent
opinion polls indicating that the Labour Party's long lead
over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative
Party has been cut to 15 points from about 20 points.
Technical factors, such as a stock shortage because of firms
scrambling to fill buy orders, also fueled the advance.
   But analysts cautioned that the market, which has been
flat for most of this year, won't hold up against bad news at
home or from Wall Street. If it looks as though falling
interest rates and full EMS membership won't happen until
next year, Mr. Hodgson said, "the market won't sit and
twiddle its thumbs." He added that London "still needs the
comfort blanket of a strong New York market," with falls on
Wall Street likely duplicated in London.
   The rise yesterday on London's Stock Exchange was
broad-based, though consumer sectors showed particular
strength, while oil and property stocks lagged. Volume was
robust, with 556.4 million shares traded, up from 330 million
shares Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Zurich, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan; lower in Paris and Frankfurt. South
African gold stocks closed down.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, stocks ended higher in
Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei and Wellington, and were lower in
Sydney, Singapore and Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
