   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
a federal judge ordered Thomas James Associates Inc., its
former president and a director to repay $1.5 million in
connection with four initial public offerings underwritten by
the firm in 1989.
   The order stems from an SEC complaint in March charging
the Rochester, N.Y., concern with undisclosed domination of
the market for four companies' stocks. The suit also charged
that the securities firm used "fraudulent and high-pressure
sales techniques" to inflate demand for the stocks.

   Of the $1.5 million payment ordered by the federal
district court in Rochester, $300,000 is to be paid by Thomas
James Associates; $800,000 by Brian Thomas, former president
of the firm; and $400,000 by James Villa, a 50% owner of the
firm and a member of its board. Mr. Thomas also agreed to
accept a lifetime ban from the securities industry, the SEC
said.
   The SEC alleged a scheme involving the shares of Sunrise
Technologies Inc., Phoenix Laser Systems Inc., Megamation
Inc. and International Superconductor Corp. The agency said
Thomas James Associates generated about $4.5 million in
undisclosed excessive mark-ups by purchasing securities from
customers at arbitrary prices and reselling them to other
customers at arbitrary prices.
   Thomas James Associates and Mr. Villa didn't return phone
calls seeking comment. Mr. Thomas couldn't be reached for
comment.
