   Small investors' springtime passion for stock mutual funds
is showing no signs of waning. Investors poured $2.2 billion
into stock funds in April, and fund groups report even
stronger inflows this month.
   So far this year, net inflows into stock funds -- at $7.8
billion -- are 34% above the $5.8 billion for all of 1989.

   Much of this new money hasn't ended up invested in stocks,
because stock fund managers have remained stubbornly bearish.
In April, the percentage of stock fund assets in cash jumped
to 12.5% from 11.9% in March. That rise is the fourth
consecutive monthly increase, according to data from the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group.
   But there is evidence that some of that cash recently got
put to work, helping to propel this month's stock market
rally. Cash positions are falling fast at the 56 stock mutual
funds tracked by Indata, a service of Gordon, Haskett &amp; Co.
The firm says cash at these 56 funds stands at 9.7% of
assets, down from 11.6% at the end of April and 12.5% at the
end of March.
   Signs abound of growing enthusiasm for stocks among fund
managers. Peter Lynch, who retires today as manager of $13.8
billion Fidelity Magellan, has cut the fund's cash hoard to
$1.3 billion from $1.7 billion over the past month. So far
this month, the average cash position at Massachusetts
Financial Services' 14 stock mutual funds dropped to 12.2%
from 12.8%. Janus Group's flagship fund, $1.1 billion Janus
Fund, has shifted to 3% cash today from 22% cash at the end
of April.
   Though April was a strong month for stock fund inflows, it
couldn't match March's feverish pace, when stock funds pulled
in $3.1 billion more than they surrendered to departing
shareholders. (This figure includes new sales less
redemptions, plus money switched among stock funds and other
funds. Reinvested dividends are excluded.)
   April's stock fund sales got a $662 million boost from the
initial offering of American Fund Group's Smallcap World
Fund, which was the second-largest initial stock mutual fund
offering ever. The largest was the $1.1 billion launch of the
Gabelli Value Fund in September 1989.
   People buying global small cap funds "is a sign of
increased confidence," says Avi Nachmany, an analyst with
Jesup &amp; Lamont Inc. "That's about as far away as you can get
from the conservative, capital conservation approach."
Smallcap World now will be closed to new investors until at
least January 1991, so that the fund's adviser can invest the
money already pulled in.
   May's stock fund sales promise to be even better than
April's. "This is probably the best month we've had since the
fall of '87," says Henry Schmelzer, an executive vice
president with New England Securities.
   This month, $300 million has poured into Vanguard Group's
stock funds, up from $187 million in April. The group's
bestselling fund is its Index Trust-500 Portfolio, an index
fund that seeks to track the performance of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index. Among Vanguard's sector funds, its
gold fund suffered net outflows in May, while its health care
fund was the biggest money magnet.
   In April, small investors put slightly more money into
junk funds than they withdrew, the first time that has
happened since June 1989.
   The overall data, however, show a $272 million outflow
from junk funds in April. But that number reflects a $290
million withdrawal that came because of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc., American Express Co.'s brokerage firm
subsidary. Shearson, which had made an ill-timed move into
junk bonds in early 1989, liquidated its entire junk fund
holdings in April.
   The small investor's renewed interest in junk continued
this month. Massachusetts Financial, T. Rowe Price Associates
and Vanguard all report net inflows into their junk funds in
May.
   April's upward spike in interest rates caused a rash of
withdrawals from bond funds, so that -- excluding junk --
only $239 million flowed into bond and income funds in April,
down from $1.2 billion in March.
   But fund groups say bond fund sales recovered in May.
"We're looking at the strongest new sales in over a year,"
says Michael Hines, a marketing vice president at Fidelity
Investments. "People are thinking that interest rates have
peaked. That's a real turnaround from the month of April."
