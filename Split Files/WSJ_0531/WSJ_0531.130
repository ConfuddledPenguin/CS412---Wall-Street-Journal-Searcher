   ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., Irving, Texas, said its board
approved a change in its 1.3 million warrants outstanding,
allowing holders to exercise them between Aug. 15, 1990, and
May 2, 1993. Previously, the pizza restaurant chain said,
holders could exercise the warrants only in the 90 days
preceding May 2, 1993.
   The warrants, which are exercisable at $4 a share, were
issued when ShowBiz was spun off from Integra-A Hotel &amp;
Restaurant Co. at the end of 1988. ShowBiz has about 6.1
million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.

   Hallwood Group Inc., a New York merchant bank, and its
affiliates own about 1.2 million of the warrants. Hallwood
previously agreed to exercise 800,000 of the warrants in June
for $3.2 million, increasing its stake in ShowBiz to more
than 20% from about 8%. ShowBiz said it plans to use proceeds
from the transaction to reduce its debt and to expand.
