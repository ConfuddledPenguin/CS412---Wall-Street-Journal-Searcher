   ALITALIA S.p.A. (Milan, Italy) -- Directors of Istituto
per la Ricostruzione Industriale named Michele Principe, 66
years old, a Christian Democrat and chairman of the state
telecommunications holding company STET S.p.A., chairman of
Italy's flagship airline, succeeding Carlo Verri, who was
killed last July in an auto accident. The nominations had got
bogged down in political infighting and were postponed until
after Italy's administrative elections in early May.
