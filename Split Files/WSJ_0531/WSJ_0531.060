   LONDON -- Britain's longer leading indicator of economic
activity fell in April from March, continuing a nearly
two-year slide, the Central Statistical Office said.
   The index, which indicates economic turning points about a
year in advance, dropped to 92.9 from 93.6. The index has
declined or stood even each month since May 1988.

<TEXT>
   The agency said the index's fall so far in 1990 is partly
because of the influence of declining share prices.
   The coincident index, which generally moves in line with
current economic activity, also declined in April to 97.4
from 98.4 in March. This index has declined or gone unchanged
since August 1988.
   The shorter leading and the lagging indexes aren't
available for April.
