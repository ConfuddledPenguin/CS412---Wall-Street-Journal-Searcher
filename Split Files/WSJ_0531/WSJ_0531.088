   It adds a whole new terror to taxes: Many financial scams
now involve accountants and tax preparers who select their
victims from among those whose returns they handle.
   In one such case, a jury in Dayton, Ohio, recently found
Naomi Taubman guilty of 60 counts of securities-law
violations in connection with the sale of "promissory notes"
to her tax clients. Victims testified that the 64-year-old
accountant told them they would receive returns as high as
24%, tax-free, says Richard Lipowicz, a prosecutor with the
fraud and economic-crimes division of the Montgomery County
prosecutor's office.

   Cases like this alarm securities regulators, who foresee
an increase in the number of complaints of fraud and abuse
involving accountants. The reason, they say, is that more and
more accountants are giving investment advice without, in
most cases, having to register as investment advisers.
   "They've got the books and records to know how much money
is there for the taking, and they have your trust," says
Scott Stapf of the North American Securities Administrators
Association. "That's a big leg up on ripping someone off."
   In the Taubman case, most of the victims were the
accountant's tax clients, says Mr. Lipowicz, assistant
prosecuting attorney. "She had prepared their tax returns --
in some cases for 40 years," he says. So when it came to
accepting investment advice, "they trusted her judgment
implicitly."
   Ms. Taubman's attorney, John H. Rion, says that his client
"merely borrowed money from clients and signed promissory
notes to secure those loans. We fully expect the case to be
reversed on appeal."
   Accounting-industry officials say that abuses by certified
public accountants aren't widespread. The cases that get
publicity typically involve financial advisers who take
custody of their clients' funds and sell investment products,
says John Hudson, director of accounting and consulting
services at the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. "These are not areas that most CPAs get involved
in," he says.
   Many cases of fraud involving accountants are Ponzi
schemes in which money from new investors is used to make
"interest" payments to those who invested earlier. Victims
are also often lulled by words such as "guaranteed,"
"insured," and "tax-free." As a result, they may not become
suspicious for months or years -- or until they try to get
their principal back.
   Typically, victims of these schemes are given bogus
debentures and promised returns in the 12% to 15% range.
   To get the money to "invest," they are frequently
encouraged to withdraw funds from individual retirement
accounts and other tax-deferred retirement plans, even though
this subjects their money to a 10% early withdrawal penalty
and taxes. In a recent case in Missouri, officials at the
state securities division allege, accountant Paul B. Brock
told clients his firm would pay the penalties for them. Mr.
Brock is currently awaiting trial on criminal charges in a
state court in Neosho, Mo. The public defender assigned to
the case had no comment.
   Investors are more vulnerable to fraud perpetrated by
their accountant because they know the person, securities
regulators say. They also say people are less suspicious of
investment advice proffered by an accountant -- particularly
when it includes tax strategies -- than they would be if it
came from a stockbroker or some other financial professional
who they figured was getting commissions for selling the
products being recommended.
   Consider the case of John Wyatt Duncan Jr., a 29-year-old
accountant sentenced to five to 15 years in prison in Kansas
after pleading guilty to several charges. According to the
arrest warrant issued for Mr. Duncan, one of his victims was
a widow with nine children whose tax returns he prepared.
   The warrant alleged that Mr. Duncan told her to withdraw
$203,238 from retirement accounts and mutual funds and put
all her money into something called "International
Investments." He told her the investment was fully insured
and would pay 12%, guaranteed for five years, the warrant
alleged. In fact, it said, the company didn't exist, and the
woman lost all her money.
   Other alleged victims included a couple who were told that
their IRAs needed to be rolled over into some other
tax-deferred program, a wheelchair-bound widow with a
maturing certificate of deposit, and a 17 year-old who had
received his father's death benefit. "This took away his
chance of a college education, and one retiree is now mowing
lawns to make ends meet," says Kansas Securities Commissioner
M. Douglas Mays.
   An attorney retained by Mr. Duncan had no comment.
   Accounting regulations vary from state to state, but only
a few states require accountants to register as investment
advisers -- and then only in some cases. Accountants are also
exempt from federal registration requirements for investment
advisers, as long as giving investment advice is incidental
to their practice.
   Various measures have been proposed to subject accountants
who give investment advice to greater regulation. A bill
introduced in Congress in March by Rep. Rick Boucher (D.,
Va.) would require accountants and others who receive
compensation as financial planners to register as investment
advisers.
   Accounting-industry officials say, however, that having
accountants register as investment advisers wouldn't curb
fraudulent or abusive behavior, but would leave accountants
open to more lawsuits. Consumers would be the ones to suffer
in the end, they say.
   "Qualified, competent, objective practitioners would be
deterred from giving financial planning advice because of the
specter of potential litigation," says William Goldberg,
chairman of personal financial planning legislation and
regulation subcommittee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.
   Whatever the case, an investor's best hope of avoiding
fraud, says securities regulators, is to "exercise the same
judgment you'd use with any investment adviser, such as a
financial planner or stockbroker," says Mr. Mays, the Kansas
regulator. "If you're suspicious, check with the securities
regulator in your state, or the state board of accountancy,
which will tell you whether they're certified and whether
they've had any complaints."

             Red Flags for Accounting Clients
                                                                                                       

   Spotting a crooked accountant or tax preparer can be
tough, but some things should make you suspicious. Think
about taking your business elsewhere if your accountant:
                                                                                                       

 -- Tells you to withdraw money from IRAs, 401(k)s, pension
plans and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts and put
all of it in another investment.
                                                                                                       

 -- Dangles an offer to get you into an investment with
above-market returns (say, 12% in the current environment),
especially if the investment is "tax-free."
                                                                                                       

 -- Urges you to put all of your money in a single
investment, particularly one that's supposedly "insured,"
"guaranteed" or "tax-free."
                                                                                                       

 -- Suggests driving you to the bank, meeting you there or
coming to your home to get the money for some hot investment
opportunity.
