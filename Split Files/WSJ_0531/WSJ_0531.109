   HOUSTON -- Partners Oil Co. said it acquired a 75% working
interest in certain gas-producing properties of Atlantic
Richfield Co. for $5.2 million.
   The properties are located in Blocks 956 and 967, North
Padre Island, offshore of Texas. In addition, Partners said
it acquired the full working interest in Atlantic Richfield's
as-yet undeveloped Block 947 of North Padre Island. Partners
did not disclose the purchase price for that block.

approximately 35 miles east-southeast of Corpus Christi,
Texas, in water 125 feet deep.
