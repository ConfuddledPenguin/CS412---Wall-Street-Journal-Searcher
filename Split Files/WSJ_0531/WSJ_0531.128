   Canada's Belzberg family sold its entire 11.7% stake in
Armstrong World Industries Inc. at a loss yesterday, bailing
out of a yearlong losing battle to effect a takeover or
otherwise influence the course of the company.
   Belzberg-controlled First City Financial Corp. sold its
4.8 million shares in one block for $35.75 a share, or a
total of about $171.5 million. The late-afternoon trade
occurred at about $1.625 below the prevailing market price
and left First City with an estimated loss of $16 million to
$18 million on its investment. The Belzbergs' personal loss
was significantly smaller.

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Armstrong's shares closed at $35.75, down $1.50.
   "We didn't do all the things we wanted to do with
Armstrong. But we've certainly focused the world's attention
on it," said W. Gordon Lancaster, First City Financial's
executive vice president, and a longtime associate of family
patriarch Samuel Belzberg. Mr. Belzberg recently described
the Armstrong stake as a "long-term" holding, though he
didn't rule out a possible sale of the shares.
   First City Capital Corp., the Belzbergs' New York-based
merchant bank, issued a cryptic, one-page statement, in which
it said, "It is now clear to us that we cannot play an active
role in enhancing value for Armstrong shareholders.
Accordingly, we have decided to sell our Armstrong shares and
look for investment opportunities elsewhere."
   Armstrong, a Lancaster, Pa., maker of flooring and other
building products, said the repurchase was in the best
interests of shareholders. "We can get down to the business
of building up the results of the business," a company
spokesman said.
   Armstrong is believed to have purchased 1.6 million of the
Belzberg shares as part of its continuing stock repurchase
program. The spokesman would not comment on the number of
shares purchased beyond saying it was "significant."
   The remaining shares were apparently purchased by
institutional investors through Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which
handled the buy side of the trade, said one market source.
Goldman Sachs is Armstrong's investment banker.
   Industry analysts said they were not surprised that the
Belzbergs sold their stake, particularly in light of recent
setbacks in their drive to buy Armstrong or find another
bidder for it.
   Last month, Pennsylvania passed a strict anti-takeover law
at Armstrong's behest. A few days later, the family lost a
bitter proxy fight at Armstrong's annual meeting, managing to
seat only one of four directors on the company's 13-member
board.
   "The market has been discounting the Belzbergs' presence
for some time," said John Baugh of Wheat First Securities.
"The Belzbergs had few options: holding the stock for
investment purposes or selling it."
   Jonathan Goldfarb of Merrill Lynch Research said the
Belzbergs' ownership of Armstrong stock was probably a damper
on the company's stock price. "Their big block was hanging
over the market," Mr. Goldfarb said. "Everyone was thinking,
`How are they going to get rid of it?'"
   The Belzbergs first disclosed their interest in Armstrong
last July 3, when they announced a 9.85% stake in the
company, in a filing with securities regulators.
   The Belzbergs' sudden exit from Armstrong follows a spate
of bad news at First City Financial, whose earnings tumbled
in the first quarter, and whose stock is languishing near its
52-week low of C$7.25. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, its shares closed at C$7.50, unchanged.
   Family patriarch Samuel Belzberg said earlier this month
that losses on arbitrage trading largely accounted for the
big drop in first-quarter earnings of First City Financial,
the family's flagship investment and holding company.
   As reported, First City's profit totaled C$5.2 million, or
10 Canadian cents a share, for the period, down from
prior-year net, before special items, of C$31.7 million, or
58 cents a share. The sale of an investment swelled last
year's first-quarter net to C$155.4 million, or C$2.82 a
share.
   Much of First City Financial's earnings in recent years
came from what critics say is classic greenmail -- acquiring
a big stake in a company, threatening a takeover, then
selling out at a profit, often to the target itself. With the
takeover boom waning, partly because of the end of easy
junk-bond financing, some investors are wondering where First
City Financial will go from here.
   The sale of the Armstrong stake at a loss and Mr.
Belzberg's recent hints that First City is exiting arbitrage
suggest that that the Belzbergs may be considering a shift in
the company's focus.
   Mr. Belzberg has provided few clues, though he said
recently he sees major opportunities arising in real estate,
particularly on the West Coast, where the family has major
interests.
