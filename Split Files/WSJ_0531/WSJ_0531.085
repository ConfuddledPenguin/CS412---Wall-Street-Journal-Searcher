   We hope laid-back George Bush can calm Mr. Gorbachev's
frazzled nerves. He seemed a tad testy in Canada. On
Lithuania: "The Americans ask me what will you do with
Lithuania? I say we will do it our way so that it will be in
the spirit, the style, of perestroika. And that does not
exclude the most strict measures." On German reunification:
"The West hasn't done any thinking but has tried to dictate,
and that doesn't suit us." Over to you, Mr. President.
