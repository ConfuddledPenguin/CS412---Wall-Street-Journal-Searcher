   NEW YORK -- The market climbed higher, but on weaker knees
than Tuesday.
   The session was marked late in the day by the sale of a
huge block of Armstrong World Industries' stock.

   Traders say profit-taking has begun to sap the market's
strength and may mean more selling in the next few sessions.
   "We tickled the 2900 area {on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average} but the market wasn't enthusiastic enough," says
Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns.
   But Mr. Solomon didn't predict a change of course. Any
pull-back should set the stage for a summer rally that could
take the industrial average to 3000, he says.
   The industrial average surged at the opening, but fought
bouts of selling through the session. By 3:30 p.m. EDT, the
index had dropped into the red before recovering to a modest
8.07 point gain at 2878.56 -- its second high in the past two
sessions.
   The broader market tracked the blue chips, with Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index also hitting a high at 360.86 on a
0.21 point rise. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
added 0.18 to 196.75, while the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
rose 0.25 to 335.67.
   Armstrong World Industries was the third-most active
stock, falling 1 1/2 to 35 3/4 after Canada's Belzberg family
sold its entire 11.7% stake in the company. Trading volume in
the stock reached about 5.1 million shares. Bear Stearns
handled the sell side of the 4.8 million share block, while
Goldman Sachs handled the buy side.
   The Belzbergs' attempts to win control of Armstrong were
crippled by a recent anti-takeover law passed by
Pennsylvania. The family recently won one seat on Armstrong's
board in a proxy fight, but failed to win three other seats.
   Big Board volume was a strong 199,540,000 shares, compared
with 137,410,000 shares Tuesday.
   Advancers led decliners, 803 to 691, with 523 stocks
ending unchanged.
   Mitch Meisler, executive vice president of world-wide
equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton, says that despite
selective profit-taking, institutions still have a healthy
appetite for stocks.
   "This market could take a breather any time, and that
could be soon, but there's still a lot of interest out
there," Mr. Meisler says.
   He adds that as the market gets extended, investors are
looking for value.
   And despite the recent sharp gains stock analysts say
there are still major areas where values can be found.
   David Dreman, managing director at Dreman Value
Management, says computer stocks, for example, may still have
room to move on the upside.
   "Taken over a three- or four-year period, the computer
area is still undervalued relative to the Dow {industrial
average} or S&amp;P 500," he says.
   He also sees good value in bank stocks, which have fallen
far behind the broader market as a result of worsening real
estate markets.
   Dividend-related trading boosted volume in two bank
stocks. First Interstate added 3/8 to 38 1/4 on volume
bloated by a block of 710,000 shares that was traded in the
morning. The block represents about 1.3% of the company's
total shares outstanding. First Interstate pays a
75-cent-ashare quarterly dividend, giving the stock a 7.8%
annual yield at its current trading price.
   First Bank Systems gained 3/4 to 15 1/2, on volume of more
than five million shares. A 2.5 million-share block,
representing about 4% of the banking concern's shares, was
traded in the early afternoon. First Bank will pay a 20.5
cent-dividend to holders of record today.
   In so-called dividend rolls, a buyer seeking dividend
income buys a block of stock and then sells it back to the
original owner at a slightly lower price. Settlement of the
trade is arranged making the short-term buyer the shareholder
of record for the dividend distribution.
   Traders say big volume in Texas Utilities was also
dividend related. The stock, which ended up 1/8 at 36 3/8 on
volume of 5.9 million shares, goes ex-dividend next week.
   International Business Machines gained 1 1/8 to 120 7/8 on
volume of more than 2.8 million shares.
   Global Marine was high on the most active list again,
adding 3/8 to 5 1/8. The stock has been active since a
private placement of 13.4 million shares was oversubscribed
last week.
   Wendy's gained 5/8 to 6 1/4 in active trading. Shearson
Lehman Hutton upgraded the stock and raised its earnings
estimates for the company.
   Wendy's chief executive officer, James W. Near, said
estimates that the company will earn eight cents to 10 cents
a share in the current second quarter are "low," according to
Dow Jones New Service.
   Walt Disney rose 6 to 125 3/4. Wertheim Schroder repeated
its "buy" recommendation on the stock, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Xerox fell 1 3/4 to 46 1/2. The Wall Street Journal's
"Heard On The Street" column cautioned that Xerox faces new
write-offs at its Crum &amp; Forster Insurance unit.
   L.A. Gear continued to slide, dropping 3 3/4 to 43 5/8 in
heavy trading. Profit-taking hit the stock Tuesday, clipping
off 1 3/4 points.
   Avery International dropped 1 1/2 to 24 3/4. The company
said it expects to report second-quarter net income as much
as 10% below the 55 cents a share reported in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Consolidated Edison of New York slipped 1 to 23 5/8.
Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the stock to a "hold" from a
long-term "buy," according to Professional Investor Report.
   Circus Circus Enterprises slid 2 5/8 to 62 5/8. Late
Tuesday, Bear Stearns took the stock off its recommended list
and downgraded its rating to a "hold" from a "buy,"
Professional Investor Report said. Analysts say the stock's
price had risen too far, too fast.
   Bally Manufacturing fell 1 1/2 to 10 5/8 after a delayed
opening. The company has begun an offer to exchange shares of
its common stock for any and all of its 13 5/8% subordinated
debentures due Jan. 2, 2001.
   Great American Bank added 5/8 to 3 1/8. Great American,
the nation's eighth-largest thrift, must raise $350 million
in new capital by year end or face a possible federal
takeover.
   Emerson Radio added 1/2 to 4 1/8 following reports late
Tuesday that Fidenas Investment raised its stake in the
company to 7.5% of the total shares outstanding. Fidenas
disclosed in filings that it is continuing discussions with
the company aimed at improving shareholder value.
   Par Pharmaceutical added 5/8 to 6 3/4. The company said it
completed the acquisition of the 40% minority interest in
Quad Pharmaceuticals from three individuals who had been
members of Quad's senior management. Quad is now wholly owned
by Par.
   Taiwan Fund surged 1 5/8 to 26 1/2, following a rebound in
the Taipei stock market that began on Saturday.
   Equimark ended off 5/8 to 7 1/2 following the resignation
of the company's vice chairman Tuesday. The company said the
position won't be filled.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.35
to 362.91. The Amex volume totaled 16,295,340 shares,
compared with 11,437,945 shares Tuesday. There were 276
issues advancing, 293 declining and 259 were unchanged.
