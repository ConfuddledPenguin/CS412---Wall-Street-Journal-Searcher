   A potent new form of portfolio insurance, the trading
strategy that helped exacerbate the 1987 crash, has crept
into the stock market, threatening to turn market drops into
deep plunges.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a hard
look at "portfolio puts," a strategy using stock-index
options and futures that, like the now-discredited older
style of portfolio insurance, is used to protect
institutional investors against losses when the stock market
drops.

   According to the SEC, portfolio puts were successfully
used to protect about $2 billion in institutional stock
holdings during the Oct. 13, 1989, minicrash, when the Dow
Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points, almost all in
the final 80 minutes of trading.
   The put strategy is part of a sophisticated "dynamic
hedging" technique done mainly through Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
and Salomon Brothers Inc., according to people familiar with
the Wall Street firms. Dynamic hedging "can have a severe
impact on the liquidity of the futures and securities
markets," the SEC warned in an agency report on the Oct. 13
plunge. Adds Richard Ketchum, the SEC's market-regulation
chief: "We're uncomfortable with the fact that firms are
choosing to use this kind of dynamic hedging strategy that
puts risks into the market."
   How widely is it used now? The SEC isn't quite sure,
although agency officials say it's far less than the $60
billion or so of portfolio insurance in place before the 1987
crash. Still, "it gets used most when the market has moved up
a lot," Mr. Ketchum says.
   As the Dow Jones average sets record highs, that makes the
SEC nervous. "The markets start to move again, and you sort
of wonder what happens," Mr. Ketchum adds.
   The big loser may be the small investor, who is almost
helpless on days like Oct. 13. Indeed, the revival of
portfolio insurance illustrates how the stock market is
increasingly being influenced by big investors using complex
strategies to manage their risk and to trade.
   Traditional portfolio insurance -- heavily used by
institutional investors before the 1987 crash but now almost
defunct -- uses stock-index futures to protect against loss
on stock investments. (Stock-index futures allow investors to
bet on a basket of stocks without owning the actual shares.)
   The goal of portfolio insurance is to provide more
protection against losses in falling markets, while reducing
hedges if a stock portfolio is doing well without them. But
the product proved to be a failure by the 1987 crash, when
hordes of institutions tried to get out the door at the same
time by selling stock-index futures, helping to drive the
stock market down sharply.
   Portfolio puts change the strategy slightly. A large
pension fund or insurance company that is concerned about its
stock portfolio buys stock-index options to protect that
investment. Those "put" options allow the institution to make
money if the market falls, balancing losses in its stock
portfolio.
   The options are sold by a brokerage firm as a service to
its largest clients, and the brokerage firm makes money when
the stock market goes up or remains flat. But the brokerage
firm has to pay out money to the pension fund or insurance
company if the stock market falls and the options become more
valuable. Unlike the traditional strategy, the brokerage
firms, rather than the institutions, take most of the risk.
   So, to hedge its own risk, the brokerage firm sells
stock-index futures contracts. That bet pays off if the
futures basket falls in price. And, if the stock market
continues to fall, the brokerage firm sells additional
futures or stocks to protect itself. As in the case of
traditional portfolio insurance, the selling kicks in at
"critical periods," the SEC says, accelerating price
declines.
   The problem for the markets comes on days like Oct. 13
when the stock, options and futures markets start to fall
precipitously. In that case, UAL Corp. announced that its
leveraged buy-out was collapsing. The markets reacted
fiercely, driving down prices in huge gaps. The brokerage
firms weren't hedged enough against what they owed the
institutions for options.
   So they scrambled to sell stocks -- and sold them in
droves. For example, the SEC says in its report that at 3:49
p.m. EST, just before the DJIA hit its bottom, down 200
points, the New York Stock Exchange floor was "hit by a spike
of program sell orders for 2.5 million shares from three
firms." The SEC declined to identify the three firms, but two
of them are believed to be Salomon and Morgan Stanley.
   The SEC report continues: "While all three firms indicated
that these programs were hedging transactions, two of the
firms, accounting for 2.08 million shares or 83% of this
spike, attributed their stock selling directly to hedging
risks from portfolio put strategies."
   Simply phrased, these firms executed massive sell orders
in the stock market at a point when the market could least
handle it.
   Morgan Stanley executives don't dispute the SEC's account
of events. But they defend portfolio puts, contending that
Morgan Stanley provides clients with a customized product
that is sometimes cheaper than options that trade in the
public market. And more importantly, they say, portfolio puts
keep huge institutions insulated from market declines and
prevent them from bailing out of the stock market when stocks
slide.
   "If they don't have these {hedging techniques} in place,
they are going to sell stock," says an official in Morgan
Stanley's futures trading operation. "Through our hedging
techniques we diffuse what we have to sell over longer
periods of time and over multiple markets," he says.
   By remaining insulated from the Oct. 13 plunge, some
institutions were able to focus on buying opportunities when
the stock market was down, adds another Morgan executive.
"When they have this downside protection, they will be much
more willing to step to the plate and do some buying," he
says. The stock market bounced back the next trading day,
Oct. 16, with the DJIA closing up 88.12 points.
   Salomon officials declined to discuss the SEC study. "Our
sales of stock on Oct. 13 were the result of hedging our
customers' commitments, which were made prior to Oct. 13,"
says Stanley Shopkorn, vice chairman and head of equity
trading at Salomon. He declined to elaborate.
   The SEC hasn't decided whether to take any action to curb
portfolio puts. It could consider forcing brokerage firms to
increase their capital if they write these options.
Meanwhile, "they have every right to do that" under current
rules, says the SEC's Mr. Ketchum.
   Morgan Stanley officials complained that the Big Board was
the only place traders could hedge increasingly risky options
positions on Oct. 13, because officials at Chicago and New
York exchanges had shut off all important stock-index options
markets in an effort to stem the market rout.
   For example, at 3:16 p.m. Eastern time, exchange officials
shut down options trading on the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock
index at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest
options market, because of market volatilty. Regulated by the
SEC, the CBOE is where portfolio insurers regularly hedge
their risks. The trading shutdown in the big options pit
created havoc and tremendous risk for hundreds of options
players. Immediately, the CBOE market makers began selling in
other stock and futures markets, including the Big Board.
