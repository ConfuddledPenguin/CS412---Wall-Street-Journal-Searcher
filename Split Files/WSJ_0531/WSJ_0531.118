   NEW YORK -- Investors pushed stock and bond prices higher
for the second day, and this time the volume in stocks was
heavy enough to suggest a broadening interest in the market.
   New records were set by the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which rose 8.07 points to 2878.56, and by Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index, which inched ahead 0.21 to 360.86. Volume on
the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 199.5 million shares
from Tuesday's thin 137.4 million.

   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose a quarter of a
point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount, in modest
trading. The dollar rose narrowly against the Japanese yen
and sharply against the West German mark.
   Many investors said they continue to be mystified by the
stock market's persistent strength in the face of economic
data indicating a weaker economy. However, the same data have
helped push bond prices higher and interest rates lower,
which lessens the appeal of bonds to investors.
   "But there's a flaw in this logic," said Abby Cohen,
market strategist at Barclays. "If bond interest rates are
falling because of a sluggish economy, then investors should
ask whether profit expectations also will be falling soon. My
concern is we have had investors interpreting bad news for
the economy as good news for the stock market. It's a trading
mentality" produced by "many years of a bull market."
   Ms. Cohen attributed much of the heavy volume to program
trading and "tactical asset allocation" -- shifts of money
from bonds into stocks largely because of interest-rate
moves. But individual and institutional investors also are
contributing to the volume, said Carmine Grigoli, vice
president of equity research at First Boston.
   "The market keeps reaching new highs and attracting
interest among individuals and institutions," Mr. Grigoli
said. "Now we're crossing the point where stocks are
outperforming cash this year. Until now, cash has been king."
   Counteracting the upward pressure from such investors
eager to get into a rising market were others wanting to take
profits, said Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst at
Kidder Peabody. "There was a good tug-of-war going on," he
said, noting that the Dow industrial was up as much as 25
points earlier in the day.
   Bond prices rose on the expectation that the report on the
May unemployment rate, due out tomorrow, will be unchanged.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. In heavy Big Board trading, gainers led
losers, 803 to 691.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year
bond fell to 8.59%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6830 marks and 151.45 yen, compared with
1.6740 marks and 151.25 yen Tuesday.
