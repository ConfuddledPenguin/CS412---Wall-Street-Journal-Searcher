   Barclays Bank PLC of Britain acquired the international
private banking operations of Marine Midland Bank, the banks
said. The price wasn't disclosed.
   The operations sold by Marine Midland, a subsidiary of
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., a Hong Kong-based
financial services holding company, have a staff of 40
employees, and offices in New York City and Miami, involved
in private banking largely for clients in North America,
Central America and South America.

   Andrew Etherington, head of the Barclays international
private banking operations, said the Marine Midland line is a
"nice fit" with Barclays, which opened a private banking unit
to service the same territory three years ago. The Barclays
unit also operates offices in New York and Miami.
