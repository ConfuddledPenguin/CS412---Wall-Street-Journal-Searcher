   LOS ANGELES -- The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
several local companies have committed $39 million toward a
targeted $125 million investment fund for building 4,000
low-income housing units in California.
   The five-year fund raising effort is spearheaded by the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit community
development organization formed by the Ford Foundation in
1979. The organization operates three investment funds --
National Equity Fund, California Equity Fund and New York
Equity Fund -- which allow companies to take advantage of
federal and state tax credits for investing in low-income
housing. Since their inception in 1987 and 1988, the funds
have raised $141 million from 59 companies, and invested in
more than 5,200 rental apartments and houses in 23 cities.
