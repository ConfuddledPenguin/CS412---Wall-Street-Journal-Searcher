   NEW YORK -- A federal judge has asked the U.S. attorney's
office to review whether a free-lance reporter working for
Forbes magazine misrepresented himself as a New York City
police officer.
   The reporter, John Connolly, says he was a New York City
policeman from 1965 to 1976.

   However, Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise said in a May 22
letter that Mr. Connolly had recently presented a policeman's
badge to obtain access to sealed affidavits in the case of a
lawsuit filed by the former president of entertainer Merv
Griffin's Griffin Co. Michael Nigris Jr. filed suit against
Griffin in November, charging that he was fired in a breach
of his contract. Mr. Nigris helped put together the deal for
Griffin Co. to buy Resorts International, the hotel and
casino concern, two years ago.
   In a letter to attorneys for both Mr. Nigris and Griffin
Co., Judge Debevoise said he learned later that Mr. Connolly
doesn't currently work for the police and "may be
disseminating information derived from the affidavits."
   Judge Debevoise could not be reached for comment.
   Mr. Connolly in an interview said he examined documents in
the case before they were officially sealed by the judge on
March 9. He said he never flashed a cop's badge. "I never
even spoke to the judge," Mr. Connolly said. "His clerk
handed me the documents." In the June 11 issue of Forbes, Mr.
Connolly and Forbes staff writer/editor Richard L. Stern
co-authored a story entitled "How Merv Griffin got taken to
the cleaners," which claims Mr. Nigris had ties to organized
crime.
   James Michaels, editor of Forbes, defended Mr. Connolly
and the magazine's story, saying, "No sealed documents were
fraudulently obtained."
   Michael Chertoff, first assistant U.S. attorney in Newark,
would not confirm his office has received the letter from
Judge Debevoise, but said the case "will be reviewed if it's
a violation of the law. Any time a matter is referred by a
judge to this office for review, it will be reviewed."
