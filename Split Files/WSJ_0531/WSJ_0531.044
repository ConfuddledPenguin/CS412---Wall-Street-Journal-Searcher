   ATLANTA -- Home Depot Inc., which has seen its shares'
market value soar 20% since early May, declared a 3-for-2
stock split and effectively boosted its dividend rate 50% by
maintaining the payout at three cents a share on a post-split
basis.
   The highflying building-materials and home-improvement
company said its board made the decisions at a session after
the annual meeting yesterday.

   "We had a long discussion about it and decided it was the
right thing to do," Ronald M. Brill, senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said, pointing to strong
earnings and a recent surge in the company's share price. "We
want the shares to be more affordable on a per-share basis to
our customers and employees -- to the retail (stock)
purchasers."
   Home Depot's first-quarter net income rose 49% to $38.6
million, or 48 cents a share, from $25.9 million, or 33 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 37% to $880.9 million
from $641.5 million. The company this year has opened seven
new stores, increasing its total to 125.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Home Depot shares closed at $59.875, up 37.5 cents.
   Home Depot said it would accomplish the stock split by
issuing one-half common share for each share held, payable
July 6 to stock of record June 14. It said that after the
split, its quarterly dividend of three cents a share will be
paid Aug. 3 to stock of record July 20.
   The company has about 77 million shares outstanding. At
the meeting, shareholders approved a measure increasing the
number of authorized shares to 250 million from 100 million.
