   "All you have to do, my friend,
   Is come in and claim your prize.
   Lady Luck has smiled on you --
   Isn't that a nice surprise?
   You've won a car, a VCR,
   Or a pile of cash as well;
   And quite coincidentally --
   We have property to sell."
   -- Pat D'Amico.

   Bare Assumption
                                                                                                       

   Hitting the ground running means,
   As politics decrees,
   You run the risk, a time or two,
   Of badly skinned-up knees.
   -- Ralph Shaffer.
