   Delaying Marriage,
   Time and Again

   BRIDES AND GROOMS are getting older. People are waiting
longer to get married the first time, and they're also
waiting longer to remarry.
   In 1977, the median age of all brides was 23. First-time
brides were 21, on average, and women who remarried were 31.
In 1987, the median age of all brides was 26. First-time
brides were nearly 24 and remarrying brides were 34,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
   For grooms, the overall median age for newlywed men rose
to 28 from 25. In 1977, first-time husbands were 23 and men
who remarried were 35. In 1987, men getting married the first
time had a median age of 25 and those getting remarried were
38.
   Women now bide their time more than ever when getting
married for the second, third or fourth time. In 1977, women
who remarried did so within an average of three years of
getting divorced or being widowed; for men, the interval was
2 1/2 years. In 1987, women who remarried had waited four
years and men had waited 3 1/2 years. Widows wait almost
twice as long to remarry as divorced women. But widowers
don't wait much longer to remarry than divorced men.
                                                                                                       

   One in Five Americans
   Volunteers Some Time
                                                                                                       

   ALMOST 40 million Americans take the time to care.
   One out of five people 16 years or older volunteers some
of his or her time, based on a 1989 Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey. That appears to be off since a 1974
survey, which isn't strictly comparable, that found one in
four volunteering time to charity.
   The median amount of time people now donate is a little
more than four hours a week. The average volunteer works half
the weeks of the year.
   Women are slightly more likely than men to volunteer; 22%
of women donate time vs. 19% of men. People aged 35 to 44 are
most likely to volunteer, 29% of them do so. Only 11% of
those in their early 20s volunteer. Married people are more
likely to volunteer than others; one out of four does so vs.
14% of never-marrieds and 17% of divorced people.
   Better-educated and working people are more likely to
volunteer than others. Nearly 40% of those with four or more
years of college volunteer time, compared with 8% of high
school dropouts. And 26% of people who work part-time and 22%
of full-time workers spend time volunteering, compared with
17% of those who don't work in the paid labor force.
   Religious organizations are the most popular places to
spend volunteer time, followed by educational institutions
and civic or political groups. The elderly are more likely to
spend time with hospitals and social welfare groups than with
schools. Men are more than twice as likely as women to spend
time with sports and recreational groups and half as likely
to volunteer at schools.
   Only 9% of Hispanics volunteer, compared with 12% of
blacks and 22% of whites. But when they do volunteer,
Hispanics average 5.2 hours a week vs. 4.8 hours for blacks
and 4.3 hours for whites. Blacks and Hispanics most often
volunteer time to a church or other religious group.
                                                                                                       

   Female Graduates Close
   Part of Income Gap
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN GET MORE out of a college education than they used
to. But for men, a college degree is just a way to keep their
heads above water.
   A new Census Bureau report on income trends shows that men
aged 25 or older with four or more years of college had
$35,700 in median cash income from all sources in 1988. This
is up from the $35,300 they had in 1968, in
inflation-adjusted dollars. But for college-educated women in
this age group, income rose much faster, to $20,500 from
$16,600.
   Even with the gain, the median income of college-educated
women remains far below that of men. Women as a group still
are less likely to work than men, and those who do more often
have part-time jobs or work in lower-paying clerical or
service jobs.
   Men with less than four years of college lost economic
ground in the past 20 years. Median income for high school
graduates who didn't go on to college fell to $21,200 in 1988
from $24,300 in 1968. Even for men with one to three years of
college, income fell slightly, to $25,400 from $27,000.
   Women in all education groups had income gains. For high
school graduates, median income rose to $9,700 in 1988 from
$9,600 in 1968. For those with one to three years of college
education, median income rose fastest of all, to $13,400 from
$10,200.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OVER FOUR million babies were born in the U.S. last year,
the most recorded since the baby boom ended in 1964. The
National Center for Health Statistics reports that one-third
of the 3% rise over 1988 levels is because of a 1% increase
in the number of women 15 to 44 years old, but the rest is
due to a 2% rise in fertility rates. In other words, women
are having more children. . . . Virtually all full-time
employees in medium and large firms get paid to go on
vacation and take holidays off, states a 1989 Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey. Nine out of 10 workers get paid for going
on jury duty, 68% for being sick and 10% for hours spent
eating lunch. But only 3% of women and 1% of men get paid to
take care of a new baby (another 37% of women and 18% of men
are eligible for unpaid parental leaves). . . . The U.S.
suicide rate is relatively low -- 15th among 25 developed
countries studied by Metropolitan Life. Suicide rates are
lower in the U.K., Ireland and several Mediterranean
countries; they are higher in Canada, Japan, Scandinavia and
most of the rest of Europe.
