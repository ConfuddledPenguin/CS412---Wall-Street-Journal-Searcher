   NEW YORK -- A key aide to convicted former stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky said that he conducted numerous
illegal securities trades with defendant John A. Mulheren Jr.
and that Mr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensate
Mr. Boesky for profits on those trades.
   Michael Davidoff's testimony provided the most damaging
evidence yet in the government's case against Mr. Mulheren,
former chief of Jamie Securities Co. Mr. Davidoff appeared to
help the government much more than did his former boss, Mr.
Boesky, who testified last week.

   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud and keeping false records in connection with
his dealings with Mr. Boesky.
   Appearing nervous and speaking with a slight stammer, Mr.
Davidoff recalled a series of trades with Mr. Mulheren that
Mr. Davidoff said were designed to generate tax losses for
Mr. Boesky's trading company and to help evade net capital
requirements.
   Mr. Davidoff, 46 years old, said the trades with Mr.
Mulheren, which Mr. Davidoff said he believed to be illegal
at the time he did them, began in July 1985 and continued
until March of the following year. Mr. Davidoff said he
conducted the trades at Mr. Boesky's direction. Mr. Davidoff,
once Mr. Boesky's chief trader, pleaded guilty in 1987 to one
felony count related to securities fraud and is awaiting
sentencing.
   In every case, Mr. Davidoff said, Mr. Boesky's company
agreed to sell securities to Mr. Mulheren's firm with the
understanding that those securities would later be
repurchased. Mr. Davidoff said he repeatedly assured Mr.
Mulheren that all profits and losses from the trades "would
be borne by" Mr. Boesky's company.
   Mr. Davidoff said the first of these trades with Mr.
Mulheren involved stock of Unocal Corp. and was arranged by
Mr. Boesky himself. Mr. Davidoff said he did the trade with
Mr. Boesky after talking with him. Shown records of the trade
by assistant U.S. attorney Alfred Pavlis, Mr. Davidoff
acknowledged it was his handwriting on the documents.
   Mr. Davidoff said that Mr. Mulheren later agreed to buy
securities in five other companies with the understanding
Jamie Securities would sell these securities back to Mr.
Boesky at a later date and be compensated for any losses. By
December 1985, Mr. Davidoff said, Jamie Securities owed Mr.
Boesky's firm "over $1 million" from profits that Jamie made
on the trades.
   According to Mr. Davidoff's testimony, Mr. Mulheren
proposed a scheme where Jamie would inflate brokerage bills
it paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in late 1985. But in
March 1986, when Mr. Boesky wanted to speed up the payments,
Mr. Davidoff said that he agreed with Mr. Mulheren that Jamie
would sell Mr. Boesky securities at below-market prices,
resulting in a profit to Mr. Boesky.
   Mr. Davidoff is expected to continue his testimony today
and will likely be cross-examined by Thomas Puccio, an
attorney for Mr. Mulheren.
