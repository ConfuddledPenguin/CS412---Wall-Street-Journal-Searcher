   GORBACHEV ARRIVED in Washington for a four-day meeting
with Bush.
   After concluding a brief visit to Canada, the Soviet
leader was welcomed by Secretary of State Baker for today's
start of the superpower summit, which is expected to focus on
the future of a united Germany, arms and trade issues. Before
leaving Ottawa, he said the West's insistence on keeping
Germany in NATO is unacceptable, but indicated that he would
offer new proposals to break the impasse. Gorbachev, who also
plans to meet with South Korea's Roh in San Francisco, said
Moscow would resolve the Lithuanian independence crisis in
its own way, and that didn't exclude "strict measures."
