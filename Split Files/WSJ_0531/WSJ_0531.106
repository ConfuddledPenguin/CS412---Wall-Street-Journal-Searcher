   NEW YORK -- Fitch Investors Service Inc. pared its ratings
on Citicorp's senior and subordinated debt and its preferred
stock, while affirming the banking giant's commercial-paper
rating.
   Citicorp called the move somewhat disappointing, noting
that on Tuesday, another rating concern, Duff &amp; Phelps,
affirmed its Duff-1-plus rating on Citicorp's commercial
paper, "along with ratings for our senior debt, subordinated
debt and preferred stock that are basically in line with
Standard &amp; Poor's {Corp.} and now with Fitch."

   "The weakening economic environment" is hurting the
commercial real-estate sector and "highly leveraged
borrowers," Fitch said in announcing the downgrade. Fitch
added that Citicorp's $8.4 billion refinancing portfolio of
loans to less-developed countries "continues to be
under-reserved relative to other international lenders."
   Fitch ratings fell on Citicorp's senior debt to
double-A-minus from double-A; on subordinated debt to
single-A-plus from double-A-minus; and on preferred stock to
single-A from single-A-plus. Fitch affirmed the
commercial-paper rating at F-1-Plus.
   The Fitch downgrades affect about $15 billion of senior
debt, $3 billion of subordinated debt and $1.8 billion of
preferred stock. It affirmed ratings on about $5 billion in
commercial paper.
   "While disappointing in some aspects," Citicorp said,
"Fitch's comments are extremely positive in citing Citicorp's
diversified income stream and consistently strong global
consumer-business profits."
