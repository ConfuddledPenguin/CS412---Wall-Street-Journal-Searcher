   Centel Corp., Chicago, said it agreed in principle to sell
its Centel Communications Systems operation to a group headed
by investor Edward H. Lavin Jr. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Centel Communications Systems, which sells voice and data
systems, had 1989 revenue of $218 million.

   Centel Corp., a local-exchange telephone and cellular
communications concern, had revenue last year of $1.19
billion, excluding the communications systems operation.
Centel Corp. noted that it had said in 1988 that it planned
to sell its Business Systems Group, which included Centel
Communications Systems, Centel Federal Systems and Centel
Information Systems.
   Centel Corp. sold its Federal Systems unit, which sells
data systems to federal agencies, to a management group
earlier this year. Yesterday, the company said it is "still
seeking bids" for the Information Systems unit, which makes
data-communications products for private industry customers.
   Mr. Lavin is a onetime president and chief executive
officer of TIE Systems Inc., a maker of telecommunications
equipment.
