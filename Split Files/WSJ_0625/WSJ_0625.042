   DALLAS -- Coda Energy Inc. said it signed a definitive
agreement with Snyder Oil Corp. of Fort Worth to acquire a
25% interest in Snyder's Pawnee Project.
   The Pawnee Project encompasses about 145,000 acres in
Colorado and Wyoming and is about eight miles south of a
successful horizontal well in the Niobrara formation. Doug
Miller, Coda chairman, said the Pawnee Project will drill at
least two horizontal test wells into the same formation, at a
cost to Coda of between $2 million and $2.5 million.
