   Nelson Mandela won over U.S. business leaders with a
pledge that free enterprise would play an important role in a
post-apartheid South Africa.
   Mr. Mandela, who has been drawing a flood of support and
good will on a tour of U.S. cities, has stressed the need to
keep applying pressure on South Africa's white-minority
government. It is a message he pushed at a meeting of more
than 200 business leaders in New York Friday and is expected
to repeat to President Bush today.

   While the New York business leaders were divided over the
continued use of economic sanctions, they were uniformly
impressed with the African National Congress's deputy
president, who was freed in February after nearly 28 years in
prison. "The business community was very positive, and Mr.
Mandela came off very, very well," said Preston Robert Tisch,
president of Lowe's Corp. and the incoming chairman of the
New York Partnership.
   That view was shared by Peter Farber, a tax lawyer and
trustee of the New York Chamber of Commerce, who says that
sanctions hurt black South Africans more than anyone. "He
seems very well-informed about business and the economy," Mr.
Farber said. "He took pains to dispel the notion that there
would be wholesale nationalization of industries. Free
enterprise would play a major role, including foreign
investment."
   "I come to put forth the message that sanctions must be
intensified," Mr. Mandela told reporters yesterday when he
touched down at Washington National Airport.
   In a speech Saturday at the Kennedy Library at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston Mr. Mandela called for
a "large inflow of foreign capital, including U.S. capital,"
once democracy comes to South Africa. Limited nationalization
of industry, he said, was an option to be considered.
   Mr. Mandela expressed immediate interest in a proposal by
Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, to
establish a South African development bank -- "a place to
channel investment the minute a just government is elected,"
Mr. Goldmark said. "There are businesses and foundations that
would be interested in building the machinery for such a
bank, whether our government was ready or not," he said. Mr.
Mandela indicated he would like to follow up on the bank idea
before leaving the U.S.
   Mr. Mandela has already demonstrated enormous fund-raising
prowess. Some aides estimate the amount raised so far during
his trip at well over $1 million, with the biggest
fund-raising events yet to occur. Contributions to the ANC
have come from excited, emotional crowds at big gatherings,
such as the huge outdoor rally Saturday, as well as at
smaller functions with the rich and famous.
   During his meeting with Mr. Bush, aides said, Mr. Mandela
will insist that there is no reason to reward South African
President F.W. de Klerk for the country's recent steps toward
ending apartheid. "Mandela will tell Bush that the
initiatives for all going on in South Africa today were by
the ANC and not de Klerk," said Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's
Washington representative.
   Mr. Mandela is hoping that Mr. Bush will issue a statement
supporting sanctions and a quickening of the reform process.
"We believe Bush has the capability to put pressure on de
Klerk to insure that the entire reform process is on track
and should be speeded up," Zwelakhe Sisulu, a top aide to Mr.
Mandela, said in an interview yesterday.
   Mr. Mandela will also ask Mr. Bush to encourage Mr. de
Klerk to work to stem violence in Natal province, where
factional warfare has been under way for years.
   In addition to speaking with the president, Mr. Mandela
also will address a joint session of Congress while in
Washington. His reception on Capitol Hill tomorrow may be
somewhat muted by senators and representatives whose
constituents strongly objected to Mr. Mandela's words of
support for Fidel Castro, Moammar Gadhafi and Yasser Arafat
-- the leaders of Cuba, Libya and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, respectively.
   On a PBS special Friday, Mr. Mandela said he was
"astonished" at the critical reaction his remarks have
generated, explaining that the three men have long been
supporters of the ANC struggle.
