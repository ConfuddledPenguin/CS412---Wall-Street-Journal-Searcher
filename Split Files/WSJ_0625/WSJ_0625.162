   IRVINE, Calif. -- Helionetics Inc., which emerged from
bankruptcy-law proceedings in March 1989, said it plans to
launch a joint venture with a Chinese company to build
computer workstations in Shenyang City, an industrial center
north of Beijing.
   Helionetics Chairman Bernard B. Katz said the venture,
Shenyang Shenlong Computer Systems Co., would be financed
with equal contributions of $600,000 in cash and equipment
from Helionetics and from Northern Computer Application
Development Co., a technology concern sponsored by the
Chinese government.

   Mr. Katz said that Helionetics was attracted to China
because of the relatively inexpensive scientific talent
there. "Physics is physics the world over, and price is the
big factor" in selling computers, he said.
   After riding the wave of the defense-industry buildup in
the early 1980s, Helionetics' large debt load forced it to
seek bankruptcy-law protection in 1986. Now the company is
pinning its hopes on its computer business.
   Under terms of the agreement, Helionetics said its
recently acquired Definicon International Corp. unit will
sell to the joint-venture certain advanced technology boards
that are about to enter production. Helionetics hasn't yet
received an export license from the U.S. Department of
Commerce to sell the boards, a Helionetics spokesman said.
   Mr. Katz said Helionetics has approval to export a less
advanced board. These, or the more advanced board if
government approval is granted, will be installed in personal
computers made by the new company. The computers would be
sold mainly in China, as well as in the U.S. and Europe, for
scientific and engineering applications, Mr. Katz said.
