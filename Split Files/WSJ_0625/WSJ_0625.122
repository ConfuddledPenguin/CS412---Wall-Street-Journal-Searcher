   ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE ROCKED northern Iran as the death toll
mounted.
   The most powerful aftershock in three days shook the
devastated Caspian Sea region, triggering a landslide that
blocked a road linking the shattered town of Rudbar to the
coast and impeding relief efforts elsewhere. The casualty
toll soared to 50,000 killed and 200,000 injured, according
to a senior U.N. relief official. Sixty other tremors were
reported in the region within a 24-hour period. Army
mountaineers climbed peaks in the rugged area in an attempt
to rescue villagers trapped in remote hamlets, according to
Iran's official IRNA news agency.

   A plane carrying medicine and other supplies from the U.S.
was among 50 relief aircraft that landed in Tehran during the
day, the news agency said.

   QUEBEC INTENDS to draft its terms and conditions for
remaining in Canada.
   After the collapse of a constitutional plan to recognize
Quebec as a "distinct society," the French-speaking
province's premier said a public debate will begin this fall
on Quebec's role within Canada. Bourassa gave no hint of what
his government would demand. The proposed Meech Lake
agreement died after two provinces, Newfoundland and
Manitoba, failed to ratify it by a Saturday deadline. The
accord's collapse was viewed as a serious setback for
Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney.
   The Canadian dollar was expected to drop because of the
impasse, but traders said the decline would be cushioned by
Canada's high short-term rates.

virus.

   Israel's Sharon announced his nation won't settle Soviet
Jews in occupied territories. The housing minister's move was
seen as a way to head off any change in Soviet emigration
policy. Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign minister flew to the U.S.,
hoping to avert a crisis in U.S.-Arab ties over Washington's
suspension of talks with the PLO.
                                                                                                       

   Jordan's King Hussein said the Mideast is approaching the
same state of hair-trigger tension that led to the outbreak
of an Arab-Israeli war in 1967. The 54-year-old monarch
called for an urgent reassessment of U.S. policy in the
Middle East. He said Arabs "may have no other choice" than to
fall into another war.
