   WINTERSHEIDE, West Germany -- As defense minister of East
Germany, Rainer Eppelmann presides over the Warsaw Pact's
second most potent military. He has named a Soviet-trained
Communist as his chief of staff. At a recent gathering of the
uniformed brass of Eastern Europe, he tried gamely to march
in step.
   All of which seems pretty unusual for a man who, until a
few months ago, was one of East Germany's most prominent
peace activists.

   But even more unusual -- and worrisome for the West -- is
this: The pacifist pastor, who was supposed to aggressively
dismantle East Germany's military, has instead become its
biggest defender.
   Critics think maybe those big dinners did it. One West
German official takes part of the blame for that. He says
West Germany's military erred by inviting Mr. Eppelmann and
other East German defense officials to Western conferences in
places like Paris and Brussels.
   There, the official frets, they were wined and dined in a
manner that has given them incentive not to abolish their own
power in a unified Germany. "He likes driving in his official
car, flying in his official air force plane and, most of all,
acting like and being treated like a minister," says the
official.
   Minister Eppelmann sees this as just another example of
the West putting down his fellow East Germans. He plaintively
replies, Merchant of Venice-style: "Do not they have souls,
do not they have feelings, their own values, desire for
equality and dreams for the same opportunities in a future
Germany?"
   Western officials and many East Germans are worried about
what one West German official calls "the conversion of Pastor
Eppelmann." At the stairwell of his church, disappointed
followers have written graffiti: "Rainer Out."
   "I always knew that Eppelmann was vain," East German peace
activist Barbara Bohley told a West German newspaper, "but I
never knew he was that vain."
   But many of those who know him best consider Mr.
Eppelmann's actions totally in character for a Protestant
minister who had negotiated tricky waters for years in his
struggle against the state and thus gained a taste for
politics.
   "He has remained true to his goals, but he is very
flexible about how he gains them," says Manfred Stolper, a
lay leader in Mr. Eppelmann's church who has known him for
years. "He feels responsible for the officers. But more than
that, he loves being at the center of decision-making. He is
enjoying himself. He knows the most difficult goals are not
gained overnight."
   Says Mr. Eppelmann: "When Rainer Eppelmann went his way in
the 1970s, he felt he was one who was plowing and planting,
and with luck he would see the seeds grow. But now I belong
to the harvest. I can only say, it is a joy to be alive."
   Mr. Eppelmann, 47 years old, was 18 when the wall went up,
and it changed everything for him. He was a student at a West
Berlin school at the time, hoping to become a pilot or
architect. Instead, he returned to East Germany and became an
apprentice to a bricklayer, then studied construction
engineering.
   In the late 1960s, he was drafted into the army, but he
refused to take the oath of allegiance to communism. He was
jailed for eight months, and got out only by agreeing to work
for 18 months with an army construction brigade.
   He turned to religion as the only profession relatively
uncontrolled by authorities, and began studying theology in
1969. For 15 years, he has been the master of East Berlin's
large Samaritan Church, although he is on a leave of absence.
   Under his leadership, the Samaritan Church was the
rallying point for the unofficial peace movement from which a
good share of last October's revolution grew.
   In the middle of the 1970s, he started the "blues fair," a
musical event at the church where politics was often
discussed. Thousands of East Germans came each year. In 1982,
he started the "Berlin Appeal -- Bring Peace without
Weapons." He was imprisoned for several days.
   In 1989, he founded the Democratic Awakening Party, which
was an effort to channel spontaneous demonstrations into
established structures. In the March elections, Mr.
Eppelmann's small party joined the coalition that won.
   Many of the leading forces in the East German government
are churchmen, partly because they are the only ones who had
any organizational or leadership experience -- and Mr.
Eppelmann was considered the hardest driving and perhaps most
egotistical of them.
   Even so, his appointment as defense minister in the
coalition government was startling -- especially to some
members of the military itself. He wasn't surprised when an
officer warned him that some generals were plotting against
him.
   For a time, the first peacenik and cleric to rule over any
country's military carried a pistol to defend himself against
his new flock, the East German officer corps.
   "I had perhaps the most perilous position in the cabinet
because of the ingrained interests I was confronting," he
said over lunch at this wooded retreat near Bonn, where he
was addressing an audience of conservative academicians and
some former West German military officers. "But I'm not as
worried anymore."
   Now, it is the West that is worried about Mr. Eppelmann.
The way he sees it, the East German army serves as his best
leverage to do away with both the Warsaw Pact and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization -- long a goal of the peace
movement. So to the surprise of many -- and dismay in the
West -- he has vowed to retain the National People's Army
until both military alliances are abolished.
   "Even after unification," he says, "there must be a second
Germany army on East German territory that isn't integrated
into any military alliance." West German officials fear that
he is complicating reunification talks that resumed last week
in Berlin and encouraging foot-dragging by the Soviets.
   Speaking in May before 480 of his Soviet-trained officers
-- all of whom were required to be members of the Communist
Party -- Mr. Eppelmann promised to defend their jobs and
their army. The minister used his new pulpit to turn angry
grumbling ahead of his speech into a standing ovation.
   The officers were also pleased when he named Adm. Theodor
Hoffman, also Communist and Soviet-trained, as chief of
staff. An East German official said it was part of the deal
the shrewd pastor struck to get the army's blessing for the
job.
   Some people around Germany, both East and West, say Mr.
Eppelmann has been seduced by power and perks. His job brings
with it a villa and swimming pool, an official plane and
plenty of Western trips, on which he often brings his wife.
"He knows once the East German army ceases to exist, then so
does his power," says one West German official.
   When he landed at Bonn airport for the conference here,
the East German ambassador's Zil limousine and the more
modest car of the conference organizer, Guenther Wagenlehner,
were waiting for him. Mr. Eppelmann decided to invite the
organizer to join him in the limousine. "He likes being a
minister," says Mr. Wagenlehner.
   With relish, Mr. Eppelmann recounted for Mr. Wagenlehner
tales of his participation at the recent Warsaw Pact summit
-- how, standing out in a blue cap, he tried uncomfortably,
and perhaps symbolically, to match their military stride.
   Mr. Eppelmann says his critics are off base. "I don't know
why Rainer Eppelmann is always misunderstood," he says.
"Maybe it is because I don't speak German well enough." He
says he has learned that the only way to change institutions
is to get inside them.
   He says most of the army's officers have pledged loyalty
to East Germany's newly democratic government and will soon
take a new oath to prove it. He has also negotiated the
cancellation of new deliveries of weapons from the Soviets,
saving several billion dollars.
   He proudly calls himself the world's first "disarmament
minister." The East German army has already been reduced from
170,000 to 135,000, and he intends to reduce it further, to
100,000. To the chagrin of many of his officers, he has
renamed his embassy's military attaches "attaches for peace
and disarmament."
   He also has replaced Communist military medals, which bore
names like Marx and Lenin, with new ones. There's the new
Disarmament Medal. And there's the Order of Stauffenberg,
named for the officer who tried to assassinate Hitler.
   Mr. Eppelmann says Western attempts to abolish his army
too quickly are part of a more worrisome West German trend of
dismissing everything built by East Germany as lacking worth.
He strikes a chord with East Germans when he complains that
their interests are sometimes ignored by West Germans whose
political parties, institutions, banks and companies are
slowly taking over East Germany.
   "We learned painfully in the peace movement how people
tried to turn us into second-class citizens," he says. "We
didn't carry out a peaceful revolution only to become
second-class citizens again."
