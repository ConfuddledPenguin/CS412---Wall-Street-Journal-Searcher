   Friction Division Products Inc. agreed to pay $285,000 in
fines as part of a settlement of Labor Department charges of
asbestos-related, workplace health violations.
   The Trenton, N.J., maker of brake pads and linings for
cars and trucks also agreed to pay as much as $1.7 million
more in fines if it violates a consent order by the federal
appeals court in Philadelphia, the department's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration said. The company further
agreed to take a series of actions aimed at abating serious
asbestos-control problems, OSHA said.

   Last July, OSHA proposed fines of $2.7 million against the
company, the largest ever proposed for health violations.
   The company agreed to the settlement without admitting
guilt, OSHA said.
   Friction Division said that its president was the only
person authorized to comment on the settlement and that he
wasn't immediately available.
