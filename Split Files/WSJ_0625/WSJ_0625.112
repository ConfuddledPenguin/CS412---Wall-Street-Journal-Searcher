   WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans, outnumbered in
both chambers, love bipartisan budget summits. It's their
only chance to play in the high stakes deficit-reduction
game.
   Now they've got their summit. But so far their role has
been limited largely to carping about the slow pace of the
talks and threatening to block a deal if it risks their
party's anti-tax reputation. With the talks at an apparent
stalemate, Republican congressional negotiators exercise
little influence over their Democratic opponents, and not
much more over their ostensible allies in the White House.

   House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.), leader of the
anti-tax forces in the House, talks only occasionally. His
most memorable utterance to date has been an oration against
reviving the draft, participants say. Sen. Bob Packwood (R.,
Ore.), who played a key role in past summits, underscores his
pessimism by saying little inside the room and declaring
outside that nothing is going to happen until December. Sen.
Phil Gramm (R., Texas), an earthy economist best known for
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, is such a fervent
advocate of spending cuts that some others discount his
observations even where they're on the money.
   The exception is New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, who has
been at the budget game so long that he knows more of the
details than most others in the room. One of few Republicans
who confronted President Reagan directly about the deficit,
Sen. Domenici's obvious frustration with the creaky budget
process has abated as he sees a chance to help forge a
significant deficit-reduction pact.
   The former budget committee chairman tends to forget that
others see him as a supporting player. He annoyed White House
Budget Director Richard Darman the other day by suggesting
changes in Medicare premiums that he hadn't first cleared
with the administration. And sometimes he upstages the budget
committee chairman, Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.). On the
Senate floor one night, Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) was peppering
Sen. Sasser with questions about a pending budget resolution.
When Sen. Sasser paused to get whispered advice from an aide,
Sen. Domenici jumped right in with the answer.
   As the leader of the Republican congressional contingent
to the budget talks, Sen. Domenici can't move much beyond the
White House position -- at least right now. But once the
summit gets down to the nitty gritty of shaping a
deficit-reduction compromise, he insists there will be time
for "individual initiative" -- including plans for defense
and entitlement spending cuts and tax increases that he and
his staff are putting the finishing touches on.
   Sen. Domenici's eagerness to find the deficit deal that
has eluded him for a decade is undisguised. "There are many
proposals around," he said impatiently last week. "They're in
defense . . . in entitlements . . . in taxes," uttering the
word that others shun. "The sooner we put them on the table,
the better off we are." Traditional deficit-fearing
Republicans like Sen. Packwood and House Republican Leader
Robert Michel of Illinois are on his side, but a split among
congressional Republicans may prevent these men from being
constructive in the talks.
   That's because the one clear role that Rep. Gingrich, Sen.
Gramm and their allies may play is that of spoiler: By
threatening to denounce a compromise, they prevent it from
happening. One reason the talks are going so slowly is that
Democrats are determined not to take the blame for tax
increases that many of them believe are necessary. Mr.
Darman's new deficit-reduction proposal, which suggests
deeper spending cuts but no more taxes or other revenues than
those included in the president's January budget, reinforces
Democrats' suspicions.
   Republicans fed Democrats' fears with a round of speeches
on the House floor this spring. "Sometimes I had the feeling
they were putting up signs to show the animals: This way to
the trap," says House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta
(D., Calif.).
   Simply put, anti-tax Republicans figure they have a veto
at the summit -- and they're feeling their oats. Sen. Gramm
says flatly, "I can't envision a circumstance where the White
House would sign off on a budget agreement if I objected."
Republican congressional staffers say that Sen. Gramm and
Rep. Gingrich were named to the summit negotiating team by
Republican leaders who figured they would be more likely to
help sell any resulting compromise if they participated in
reaching it.
   That ploy might just work. Mr. Darman acknowledges that
some people were concerned that the fiery Mr. Gingrich might
not play by the rules of budget summitry, "which essentially
require that you be relatively temperate." So far, he says,
Mr. Gingrich has "favorably surprised some people."
   Because it's understood that the Democrats won't back a
deficit-reduction package unless a majority of Republicans do
too, Republicans say they wield more power than usual. "In
the Congress, we have no role other than to get overrun by
the Democrat majority," says Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,
senior Republican on the House Budget Committee. "When we are
working with Big Brother {the White House} we have the clout
we don't have in the House of Representatives."
   Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady don't
ignore their congressional brethren. The two travel to
Capitol Hill to caucus -- usually once a week -- with the
Republican negotiators. But Mr. Frenzel says the talks
usually center on what's likely to happen at the next
session. "We haven't counseled closely on the ultimate
outcome," he says. President Bush has invited the Republican
summit team to the White House this afternoon for a pep talk,
congressional staffers say.
   In past budget summits, Republican lawmakers occasionally
have moved talks forward by offering a proposal, giving both
Democrats and the White House something to talk about without
either taking the blame for presenting it. But this time,
Republican congressional leaders aren't likely to perform
that service. Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.)
is still smarting from the drubbing he took in the 1988 New
Hampshire Republican primary after George Bush unveiled his
"no new taxes" line. He isn't enthusiastic about doing Mr.
Bush's dirty work by proposing tax increases now.
   What's more, Democrats insist that they won't settle for a
vaguely Republican proposal. They want a deficit-reduction
plan with George Bush's fingerprints on it, and they reject
the one the White House sent over last week as nothing more
than a warmed over version of Mr. Bush's January budget.
   To underscore the point, Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)
delights in quoting to Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary
Brady excerpts from a speech that a Texas Republican
congressman named George Bush made in June 1967 urging the
House to reject an increase in the debt ceiling that
President Johnson was seeking.
   "We had better tell the administration again to take
another look at their figures and come back to the Congress
with some constructive proposal for reducing the amount of
the deficit," Mr. Bush said back then.
