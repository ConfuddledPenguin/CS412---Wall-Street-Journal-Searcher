   The cost of legal defense in the U.S. has become a
significant factor in evaluating the competitiveness of U.S.
operations. One multinational manufacturing company based in
France sells fewer than 25% of its products in the U.S. Yet
90% of its legal and insurance expenses were incurred here.
There are 30 times as many lawsuits per capita in the U.S. as
in Japan.
   In addition to placing U.S. operations at a competitive
disadvantage in the global marketplace, fear of exposure to
catastrophic jury awards often distorts major strategic or
product-development decisions. In a recent Conference Board
survey, 47% of the firms contacted reported having
discontinued at least one product line because of concerns
about liability litigation.

   Large verdicts catch the headlines, but the real cost of
litigation is the cost of defending cases. By restructuring
the purchasing and use of legal services, corporations can
bring costs down while preserving or improving the quality of
their legal services. The following suggestions refer
specifically to litigation, but the approach outlined here
can be applied to all legal services.
   -- Solicit bids, and hire more than one firm. Insurers
have solicited bids on legal costs for decades. But many
companies that expect and get substantial discounts on the
purchase of large quantities of equipment pay the full rate
charged by expensive law firms. Yet law firms will often
reduce their hourly rate by 30% or 40% in exchange for a
commitment for a minimum amount of work.
   Soliciting bids introduces a welcome element of
competition into the process, but it is only a beginning. If
the bid is awarded to a single firm, the effect of price
competition ends as soon as the bid is awarded and the firm
makes itself indispensable. The experience of the military
with sole source contracts illustrates the foolishness of
giving all legal work to a single firm, even one selected by
a bidding process.
   -- Avoid excessive delegation. Companies that face
litigation in many states often employ lawyers in each state,
as well as one or more national or regional "supervising
counsel" to coordinate the work of the others. This is
wasteful. Coordination should come entirely from inside the
corporation, thereby eliminating one layer of administration.
   -- Bring control of litigation in-house through policies
and guidelines. Eliminating national supervising counsel does
away with a layer of bureaucracy, but doesn't by itself bring
control of legal services inside the corporation. Often the
outside lawyers have near complete power to decide which
services the client will buy and how much it will pay.
   The company must adopt a detailed set of criteria for when
specific work should be done, how long it should take and
what it should cost. The starting point is that senior
management must get involved in the control of legal costs.
Legal expenses are too important -- and too high -- to be
left to the lawyers. If purchasing is left to staff
attorneys, they and the outside attorneys as suppliers tend
to settle into patterns of doing business that are
comfortable but costly.
   -- Institute a legal triage system: sort cases by exposure
risk. In the medical profession, "triage" is the sorting of
injured persons according to the seriousness of their
injuries. Seriousness in litigation is a function of the size
of the possible verdict or settlement and the probability of
that outcome. The precise categories depend on the nature of
the litigation, but as a general rule, cases can be sorted
into three categories, and each category should be handled
differently:
   a) Low exposure cases should be handled by paralegals, for
quick settlement. These cases involve claims for small
amounts of money. They are typified by breach of warranty
cases with no personal injuries. In-house paralegal
assistants can be trained to handle these and given authority
to settle them up to a specific amount.
   b) Mid-range exposure cases should be handled by newer
attorneys. These cases become a training ground for new law
firms, which will first bid against one another and then
eventually compete with more experienced lawyers to handle
high exposure cases.
   c) High exposure cases should be entrusted to experienced
trial counsel. For these cases, as for the others, there
should be more than one law firm, to preserve competition.
   -- Senior management should participate in setting
litigation defense policy. A lawyer who wins is popular with
the client; a lawyer who loses is not. For the lawyer,
therefore, the question of how much to do to win a case is
always an easy one: do everything possible. This may be a
sensible approach if the company has only one lawsuit, but it
doesn't work for a company with the full range of legal
problems.
   All litigation decisions involve risks. Defending each and
every case results in legal fees out of proportion to the
exposure. On the other hand, settling every case will quickly
identify the corporation as an easy mark and settlement costs
will go up. A balance is necessary.
   -- Implement a detailed cost monitoring system. The use of
computers makes it possible to set up a detailed cost
monitoring system. The company can require law firms to
submit invoices with services categorized in a way that
permits detailed analysis of time and cost. The analysis
program will make it possible to perform detailed evaluations
of the invoices, comparing the cost of similar services by
different firms or by the same firm in different cases or at
different times in the same case. The service categories
would include, as examples: meetings, pleading preparation,
motion hearings, research, witness preparation, dispositions
and preparation of answers to interrogatories.
   Controlling legal expenses is not just a task for the
legal department. The need for legal services will not go
away, but if senior management will take an active role in
reviewing the way the work is handled, in selecting among the
alternatives to find the most cost-effective approach and in
monitoring the result, it can substantially reduce the cost
of those services.
