   PARIS -- L'Oreal S.A. said it is negotiating a licensing
agreement that will give it world-wide rights to manufacture
and distribute a range of cosmetic products developed by
Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel, a French
company whose main activity is bottling and marketing mineral
water.
   Under the proposed accord, the products, which are
currently sold in high-volume retail outlets, would be
distributed through L'Oreal's sales network.
