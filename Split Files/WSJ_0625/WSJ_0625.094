   The Bush administration tomorrow may ruffle more feathers
than it soothes when it announces its preliminary plan to
regulate logging on millions of acres of Pacific Northwest
national forests to preserve the northern spotted owl.
   As long expected, the owl on Friday was declared
threatened and will be placed under the protection of the
federal Endangered Species Act on July 23.

   Timber interests and environmentalists, locked in a long
and often bitter dispute over the owl, are girding for a
compromise plan that neither side may find satisfactory. At
least one Pacific Northwest timber group, predicting the
near-term loss of as many as 50,000 jobs, already has vowed
to sue to repeal the owl's designation as threatened. The
Sierra Club, meanwhile, said it won't hesitate to march into
court if the plan by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of
Land Management seems based more on politics than on science.
   The administration, finding itself in the middle of this
rancorous debate, has indicated for weeks that it is seeking
middle ground that will allow it to protect the owl and jobs
at the same time.
   "I believe there is room in the world for both owls and
loggers," said John Turner, director of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which is responsible for protecting
endangered and threatened species.
   Mr. Turner echoed the sentiments of Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, who pledged that the management guidelines
presented tomorrow will balance preservation with the need to
limit disruption "in the communities and lives of the
residents of the Pacific Northwest."
   Those close to the situation said the delay between
Friday's announcement of the owl's listing and today's
unveiling of a tentative management plan reflects a deep
division among competing federal agencies over those very
issues. The Forest Service is believed to favor a plan --
championed by environmentalists -- that would essentially
curb timber harvesting on as much as three million acres of
old-growth forests throughout the owl's range in Washington,
Oregon and northern California. The BLM and some Interior
Department officials favor a less restrictive approach
designed to soothe industry critics.
   One federal study has estimated the species, with perhaps
2,000 nesting pairs remaining, needs at least 8.4 million
acres of old-growth habitat to survive. Because about 5.4
million such acres are in national parks or wilderness areas
already off limits to logging, an additional three million
acres would need to be set aside. Of that amount, 90% is on
federal lands, with the rest under state or private control.
   The news of the owl's listing itself was greeted with
gloom in the redwood logging corridors from California to the
Canadian border. While federal authorities predicted the move
will have little effect on this year's federal timber
harvest, there is little doubt that -- even under an
acceptable compromise -- substantial acreage will be
withdrawn from logging.
   Pessimists, such as Barry Polsky, a spokesman for the
American Forest Resource Alliance, a timber supply trade
group, predicted a "very draconian" owl preservation plan
with enormous impact on jobs. William Dennison, president of
the Timber Association of California, agreed, asserting that
the owl's threatened status would mean the annual loss of
$770 million of timber in that state alone.
   "The forest industry is the fall guy," said Richard
Whitmore, general manager of Mount Baker Plywood Inc., a
Bellingham, Wash., company with about 220 employees. "We're
going to get hurt. Families are going to get hurt. . . .
That's what it boils down to."
   "We feel like there's already plenty (of old growth) set
aside," added Tom Mayr, a principal in Mayr Brothers Logging
Co., a Hoquiam, Wash., logging concern that gets 95% of its
timber from national forests. He predicted a severe impact on
his 190 employees from reduced timber harvests.
   Environmentalists say they aren't unsympathetic to those
concerns but note that the push to list the owl resulted from
accelerated clear-cutting of the remnants of once-vast
redwood forests that stretched from California to Canada. By
one estimate, less than 10% of the original old growth
remains; the spotted owl, in carving out its evolutionary
niche, has come to be dependent on food species that thrive
under old-growth canopy. It can't survive anywhere else.
   Environmentalists, in fact, for several years have pushed
a package of proposals that they say would mitigate the loss
of jobs resulting from the owl's listing. Among them would be
a ban on the export of logs from state and federal lands, a
practice that takes jobs away from regional sawmills. They
also have suggested a massive reforestation plan for idle
Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands that would
provide jobs as well as long-term sources of timber for
Pacific Northwest mills.
