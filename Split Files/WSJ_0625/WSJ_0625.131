   Cooper Cos. said it sold $3 million principal amount of

$9 million principal amount of the company's senior
subordinated, increasing-rate notes due 1991.

   In the filing, Cooper said that no decision has yet been
reached on its motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed last
February against it by Anacomp. The lawsuit alleges
violations of civil racketeering law.
   Cooper said it continues to evaluate whether to seek a
change in control of Cooper, maintain its investment, or
dispose of its holdings.
   Officials at Anacomp, a computer-services concern, hadn't
any comment on the filing.
