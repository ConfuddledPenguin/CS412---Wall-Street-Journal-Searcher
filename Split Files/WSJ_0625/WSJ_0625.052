   Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. unveiled their
version of the Air Force's next-generation fighter jet on
Friday at Edwards Air Force Base in California, rolling out
the slate-gray aircraft under a stifling desert sun and into
an even hazier future.
   The plane, known as the Advanced Tactical Fighter, is
being billed by the nation's leading aerospace firms as the
last significant military aircraft program to come along for
many years. But the ATF, slated to cost more than $50 million
per plane, or twice as much as the Air Force's current
front-line fighters, is emerging at a time when lawmakers
increasingly question just how much the nation needs such a
warplane.

   For fiscal 1991, Congress is likely to approve less than
$800 million of the more than $1 billion requested by the
Pentagon to begin full-scale development of the ATF. More
importantly, chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services
committees have warned that the Air Force must substantially
delay long-range production plans for the estimated $63
billion program. Even Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has
carefully avoided saying how many of the proposed 750 planes
he wants to buy.
   Apart from its hefty price tag, many lawmakers and other
critics challenge the role of the new fighter. Originally
conceived to assure air superiority in the event of a
U.S.-Soviet land war in Europe, the ATF is now being touted
by the Pentagon, which already has spent $2.8 billion on the
plane, as an insurance policy against Iraq, North Korea,
Syria and other Third World countries that acquire
sophisticated Russian fighters.
   Many deficit-conscious lawmakers, however, challenge that
purpose. Rep. John Rowland (R., Conn.), a Pentagon critic who
sits on the Armed Services panel, blasted the Air Force in an
interview Friday for failing to adjust budget requests to the
changing world. "Rather than first spelling out the threat,
they say here are the weapons we currently have under
development," Rep. Rowland complained. "Then, they try to
figure out what missions the programs can carry out."
   Northrop and McDonnell Douglas hope their jet, the YF-23,
will be selected over another edition of the ATF being built
by a squadron of competitors, Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and
General Dynamics Corp. Each side, including key
subcontractors, has sunk about $700 million into the project.
And the losers will never have a shot at getting back any of
their money.
   But even the winning team, scheduled to be selected in
April 1991, has a struggle ahead. Consider that if the ATF
were built at the pace called for in April by Mr. Cheney --
and that is certain to be vastly scaled back on Capitol Hill
-- the victorious contractors wouldn't start to recoup their
investment until the late 1990s. Moreover, plans for the Navy
to produce its own variation of the ATF have been delayed
until at least the end of the decade. Navy admirals, many of
whom expressed misgivings about the ATF in the past, must
renegotiate the service's role in the overall program by the
end of this year.
   In fact, the joke around the industry is that the only two
companies to bid on the ATF program in 1986 and not be
selected to compete for it, Grumman Corp. and Rockwell
International Corp., have turned out to be the real winners
of the competition. "I'm sure not too unhappy about that
now," John Pierro, president of Rockwell's North American
Aircraft unit, said recently from the company's plant in
Palmdale, Calif.
   The YF-23, which is slightly larger but much swifter and
more maneuverable than the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle it's
designed to replace, was displayed amid much ballyhoo. Scores
of workers from the two companies stood around the perimeter
of the area where the plane was rolled out, hooting as it was
towed from its hangar.
   Thirteen dignitaries, including corporate executives and
Air Force generals, sat on a dais. Some made speeches,
proclaiming all the wonderful things the aircraft is supposed
to do. That includes flying at supersonic speeds without
using after-burners, a characteristic that improves
stealthiness as well as range. Many details about the YF-23,
such as its maximum payload, remain classified.
   Gen. Robert Russ, chief of the Tactical Air Command, noted
that the F-15 will be 20 years old by the time the ATF is
ready for service. "I dare say, not many of us are driving
around in 1969 or 1970 cars today," he said. Gen. Ronald
Yates, in charge of the Air Force Systems Command, called the
ATF "a modern miracle" and "a fighter pilot's dream." Kent
Kresa, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Northrop,
portrayed the aircraft as a proud symbol of American
ingenuity.
   Yet, at the same time, the ATF is a symbol of all that is
troubling the aerospace industry: The plane was conceived at
a time when the Pentagon, embarrassed by one scandal after
another, became determined to have companies pay more out of
their pockets as they pursued big weapons projects. Finally,
those burdensome contracting terms have eased somewhat. But
now that the ATF is ready to be born, peace is breaking out,
threatening the contractors' wherewithal and jeopardizing the
thousands of jobs that a program like the ATF normally would
be expected to generate.
   "The business base to support our investment on ATF has
disappeared," acknowledged Bill Ross, who is president of
McDonnell Douglas's fighter factory in St. Louis, where
several lines besides the F-15, including the F/A-18 and
AV-8B, are slated for massive cuts. Mr. Kresa said the upbeat
mood of the YF-23 ceremony and recent announcements of
thousands of layoffs by Northrop and McDonnell Douglas "are
not reconcilable."
   The YF-23 is set to make its first flight sometime within
the next month, equipped with engines made by United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney division. A second
prototype with General Electric Co. engines will fly after
that. "As soon as the Air Force says it's OK to go, we're
going to go," said Tom Mooney, Northrop's ATF program
manager.
   Meanwhile, the Lockheed team's entrant, the YF-22, is set
to make its maiden flight sometime in August with GE engines.
Sherman Mullin, Lockheed's ATF project chief, reiterated in
an interview yesterday the company's long-held position that
there is no disadvantage to coming out of the gate second.
"What counts," he said, "is how well you fly. Period."
