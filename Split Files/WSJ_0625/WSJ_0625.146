   The 85% operating rate in May was up from 76% in April but
down from 94% a year earlier.
   For the year to date Canadian mills produced 2.751 million
metric tons of market pulp compared with 2.990 million metric
tons a year earlier, an 8% decline. The industry operated at
87% of capacity in the first five months, down from 97% a
year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill affiliated with the producing mill.
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in May dropped 15% to 488,000
metric tons from 573,000 metric tons a year earlier.
Shipments to all markets were down.
   Market shipments for the first five months dropped 13% to
2.528 million metric tons from 2.917 million metric tons a
year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of May were
583,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, compared with 521,000
metric tons, a 29-day supply, at the end of April. Producer
inventories at the end of May 1989 were 310,000 metric tons,
a 16-day supply.
