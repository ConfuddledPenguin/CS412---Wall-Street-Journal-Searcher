   LONDON -- Wages and salaries per unit of output in the
whole economy in the fourth quarter rose a seasonally
adjusted 10.1% from a year earlier, a revision from the
previously reported 9.3%, Britain's Central Statistical
Office said.
   The figures were revised as the result of fresh data
compiled for the first-quarter gross domestic product data.
As a result of the revision, the index of wages and salaries
for the whole economy in the fourth quarter was 133.3, up
from 130.3 in the third quarter and 121.0 in the 1988 fourth
quarter. The previously reported 1988 fourth-quarter index
was 132.1.
