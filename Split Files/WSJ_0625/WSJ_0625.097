   The New York Stock Exchange said it will suspend trading
on the common stock of Schafer Value Trust Inc. before the
opening July 5.
   The closed-end investment fund declared a liquidating
distribution of $10.25 a share, payable July 5, to stock of
record Wednesday. As a result of the dividend, the market
value of the shares will be less than $5 million, the
exchange said.

   The exchange said it would apply to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to delist Schafer, a routine action when
the market value of publicly held shares falls below $5
million.
   In Big Board trading Friday, Schafer closed unchanged at
$10.50.
