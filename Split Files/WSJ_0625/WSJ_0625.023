   HIGH POINT, N.C. -- Ladd Furniture Inc. said it sold
Kittinger Co. to U.S.C. Industries for an undisclosed amount.
   The furniture maker acquired the Buffalo, N.Y., company in
July 1989 as part of its purchase of the former Maytag
Furniture Group. U.S.C. is a company formed by businessman
Michael Carlow of Pittsburgh to acquire Kittinger, Ladd said.
