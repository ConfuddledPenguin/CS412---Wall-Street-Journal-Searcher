   NEW YORK -- Gold may have plunged 20% from its February
high of $440 an ounce to about $350 currently, and some
traditional analysts may be pondering whether gold's next
move will be down to $300 or an excruciating struggle back up
to $400.
   But make way for the big-picture optimists who see glory
days for gold -- and gloom and doom for just about everything
else -- around the corner, or maybe the corner after that.

   Lawrence H. Heim says gold is headed for $8,000 an ounce.
James Dines sees $5,000 in gold's future. Anthony V. Caldaro
believes gold can reach $2,400. R.E. McMaster expects $1,000.
   When these prices might be achieved isn't a question that
elicits very specific answers. For the most part, these
people view gold as an underpriced standard of value in a
debt-ridden, problem-plagued world. At some point, they feel,
the negative financial and economic factors will become so
crushing that the inherent stability and value of gold will
suddenly become prized and cause its price to explode.
Current declines are only transitory, they say.
   For example, Mr. Heim, who says he advised traders to get
out of gold during the 1980s until 1989, links his gold boom
prediction to overheated government money-printing presses.
   Mr. Heim, who edits the Heim Investment Letter in
Portland, Ore., and heads a gold and silver dealership,
predicts a "panic into gold" that will be touched off by a
collapse of the dollar and by the "outrageous" governmental
creation of money over the past decade that has led to a
crushing national debt.
   Mr. Heim adds up a national debt of $3 trillion, a money
supply of $4 trillion and half of the $6 trillion he says the
government has in guarantees and obligations and comes up
with a "federal level of money" of $10 trillion for the U.S.
Dividing that by the 262 million ounces of gold he says the
U.S. has in stock, he says, "gold would have to be over
$38,000 an ounce to back this `money' 100%." He doesn't care
that the dollar is no longer officially backed by gold -- in
a crunch, the values of all currencies historically have been
measured against gold, he asserts -- nor that there isn't
wide recognition of his "federal level of money" concept.
   Mr. Heim is undaunted. "Only 10% backing would amount to
$3,000 an ounce for gold, which {would be} around 10 times
where it is now," he says. "I really think 20% backing is
what we will eventually see, so that would make the value of
gold close to $8,000 per ounce."
   The advance to that level will take place over the next
several years, he says. The current weakness in gold is
transitory and "will only make for a greater profit," he
says.
   Mr. Dines, editor of the Dines Letter in Belvedere,
Calif., was among the famous gold bugs when the metal rose to
a record $875 an ounce in 1980. When he first told his
clients that the price would rise from $35 to $400, he says,
"I thought I would get arrested," and so he tempered his
prediction. Now, he thinks gold will top $2,000 in the next
five years and climb to between $3,000 and $5,000 by the end
of the decade.
   These prices will be brought about by some kind of
monetary crisis, probably in the banking system, he says.
"Just look at the savings-and-loan mess, where the bailout is
now estimated at $500 billion. I've been warning about
trouble in the banking system for over 10 years, and that
includes the entire banking system. The savings-and-loan
situation is just the first shoe dropping."
   Mr. Dines believes that the Soviets have been selling gold
right along, contrary to reports that they slowed down in
May. "They have been selling gold to survive," he says.
Silver has resisted going down with gold and has actually
risen, he notes.
   "As soon as the Soviet selling stops, gold will rise again
and catch up with silver," Mr. Dines says. This move could
set the stage for an "explosive surge that will ignite a
short-covering panic that will accelerate the rally."
   Mr. Caldaro, editor of Long Term Trends, an investor
newsletter in Columbia, Md., sees gold going to more than
$2,000 an ounce by 1995 because he believes interest rates
will rise to more than 10% by late this year and to 14% to
15% by 1992 or 1993.
   He says prices in the 30-year bond market topped out in
December 1989 in what he terms a "major cyclical low" for
interest rates and that the stock market reached its peak
this month. He thinks the U.S. will get an "inflationary
recession" like the one that took place in the late 1970s and
early 1980s that will last until 1992 and will trigger a
"flight to safety" -- to gold.
   Mr. Caldaro says the real "kicker" in gold's climb will
come in 1992, when the government's printing presses go into
high gear, churning out money to get the economy out of a
recession.
   "This will create an economic expansion that will devalue
the dollar vs. its buying power, and a rush to gold will take
place," he says. Among the calamities Mr. Caldaro foresees
enhancing gold, in addition to the inflation he expects to
continue through the 1990s, is a stock market crash and a
collapse of the dollar. "Any one of those could happen," he
says.
   Mr. McMaster, in the May 24 issue of his newsletter, The
Reaper, published in Phoenix, Ariz., deals extensively with
gold and its undervaluation. He cites "other studies" that he
says "indicate that gold should be priced at approximately
$1,200 an ounce to cover U.S. net liquid liabilities."
   He says: "Gold, as I see it, is a time bomb. Gold is a
chaos hedge. Gold at any time could explode the deception and
delusion which has driven the debt-ridden post-WWII financial
world." He, too, thinks the withdrawal of the Soviet Union as
a gold seller will help the metal's price rebound.
   Not all extremist thinkers are bulls, however. Robert
Prechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist in Gainesville,
Ga., said in 1980, after gold had hit $875: "On a long-term
basis, gold won't be attractive as an investment until it
falls below $200 an ounce."
   That statement still holds, according to David Allman, Mr.
Prechter's director of research, who says Mr. Prechter no
longer gives interviews. The gold market is still in a
correction from that record high, Mr. Allman says, and
according to a series of historical chart patterns could drop
as low in the next few years as the $105 an ounce it reached
in 1976.
   Deflation rather than inflation is the great danger, Mr.
Allman says, and could cause the price decline. Historical
patterns show that after a surge of inflation, such as the
one that ran through 1980, there is a leveling-period during
which stock and real estate prices boom. That has already
taken place, he says. Then comes a period -- which he says is
now beginning -- in which commodities and real estate sag.
   "This will ultimately be followed by a drop in stock
prices as well, which will culminate in a general deflation.
The early warning signs are already present in the price
action of gold," Mr. Allman says.
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Crude oil prices jumped Friday in a market driven by
technical factors, but traders remain wary of buying in a
market glutted with crude. Trading in the crude oil pit at
the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday was at times the
lightest of the week. Many market participants are expecting
prices to decline slowly during the next several weeks.
   Production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has swamped the market with crude. Even modest
cutbacks by Kuwait, an OPEC member that had been flagrantly
violating its quota, have barely affected the huge quantities
of crude being offered for sale.
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice
                                                                                                       

   Frozen orange juice concentrate prices are expected to
settle down, according to Celeste Georgakis, tropical
commodities analyst at Cargill Investors Services Inc. in New
York. She says that prices two weeks ago were sent into a
tailspin by a combination of the Federal Reserve Board's
statements about achieving a zero inflation rate and a major
Brazilian processor offering to sell juice at prices
substantially under those quoted by other producers.
   "It appears that this processor was offering juice at a
discount for technical reasons -- a lack of storage space,"
Ms. Georgakis says. Other major Brazilian processors didn't
follow with price cuts. However, after the price cut was
announced, the U.S. futures market fell below a technical
support level at $1.89 a pound, which had held since last
December's freeze. Once that level gave way, prices plummeted
to under $1.70.
   Ms. Georgakis pointed out that the processors and dealers
started to buy as prices began to sink, slowing the decline.
Additional buying came in under the $1.70 level from
short-sellers who were evening positions that profited from
weakening prices. That buying kicked off the rally that
dominated the market most of last week.
   The Cargill analyst says she expects prices for the July
contract to rise no higher than $1.90 and to fall no lower
than $1.80. She says there is an unusually large total of
more than 4,000 July contracts outstanding. She also says she
thinks some speculative short-sellers and commodity funds
holding short positions are still in the market and will have
to buy back their positions in the next few sessions, which
could fuel a rally to about $1.90. The first day that juice
processors can give notice to the exchange that they intend
to deliver juice is next Monday.
                                                                                                       

   Livestock and Meats
                                                                                                       

   The highlight this week is a quarterly hog survey slated
for release by the Agriculture Department Friday.
   The big question is whether high hog prices are prompting
farmers to expand their herds. Such a development would help
indicate when hog prices might ease enough to bring pork
prices in the supermarket down from their current record
levels.
   Jerry Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons, said the government's June 1 survey probably found that
the nation's hog herd continued to shrink. He calculates that
the population dropped 1% from June 1989. What's more, the
number of piglets born in March, April and May probably
declined 2% -- indicating relatively tight supplies for the
rest of the year. It takes about six months to fatten a hog.
   Because of the seasonal breeding pattern, the supply of
fattened hogs should increase in the fall from the relatively
tight levels expected this summer. But some analysts don't
expect to see any significant year-to-year increase in the
supply of fattened hogs until early next year.
