   BURNABY, British Columbia -- Loewen Group Inc., a
funeral-home chain, said it agreed to acquire Houston-based
Paragon Family Services Inc. for $65.5 million.
   Loewen said the purchase, which is subject to various
conditions including board approval and possible adjustment
of the price, is scheduled to close Sept. 18.

   Paragon owns and operates 47 funeral homes, mainly in the
south-central U.S., and has agreed to acquire nine more.
Loewen said the acquisition would complement its existing
U.S. operations.
   Incorporated in 1985, Loewen spent 131.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$111.8 million) on acquisitions through 1989,
according to analyst Tony Yue of Vancouver's Goepel Shields &amp;
Partners Inc. The company now owns 164 funeral homes, 12
cemeteries and related operations, making it the second
largest funeral-service company in North America, behind
Texas-based Service Corp. International.
   Mr. Yue said further acquisitions are likely because fewer
than 5% of the 22,000 U.S. funeral homes are currently owned
by operators with multiple locations. In Canada, about 10% of
the 1,400 homes are owned by chains.
   Loewen said Paragon's 185 employees will remain with the
company and that three senior executivies will become senior
officers of Loewen.
