   Tektronix Inc. said holders filed a class-action suit
against the company and certain of its officers and
directors, alleging violations of security laws.
   The suit, filed in federal district court in Portland,
Ore., accuses Tektronix of "withholding material adverse
information from the public" from July, 1989, to February,
1990. The electronics equipment maker didn't elaborate on the
lawsuit, calling it "entirely without merit."

   As reported, Tektronix last month fired about 10% of its
13,000 work force and said it was taking a one-time charge of
$70 million against its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, as a
result of slumping sales. It hasn't announced earnings for
that quarter, ended May 26.
   For the fiscal third quarter, ended March 3, the company
posted a loss of $25.5 million, or 88 cents a share, on
revenues of $421.8 million. It earned $6.4 million, or 22
cents a share, on revenue of $434.1 million a year earlier.
