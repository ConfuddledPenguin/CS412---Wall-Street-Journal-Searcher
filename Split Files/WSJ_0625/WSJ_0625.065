   WASHINGTON -- The jump in orders for big-ticket goods last
month suggests to some analysts that the manufacturing sector
may be beginning to stabilize.
   Orders received by makers of durable goods -- factory
equipment, planes, cars, appliances and other items intended
to last at least three years -- leaped 3.9% in May, to
$128.19 billion, after dropping 4.2% in April and soaring
6.7% in March, the Commerce Department said.

   But a separate report suggested that other parts of the
economy may be softening. That data showed personal income
edged up only 0.3% in May, while personal spending was flat.
   "The durable goods report reinforces the suspicion that
the manufacturing sector is no longer declining, but we are
by no means seeing an upturn," said Laurence H. Meyer, senior
economist for Laurence H. Meyer &amp; Associates in St. Louis. "I
wouldn't anticipate a rebound."
   Mr. Meyer said he was disappointed by the weak consumer
income figure. "Usually the consumer sector is a stabilizing
sector" he said. "This sector usually tends to grow even as
the economy weakens, but now that it is slowing down so much
. . . we are losing that protection that we normally have.
That makes the economy more vulnerable to a recession."
   Many economists say they are skeptical about the upbeat
durable goods figure and suggested that the report could be
misleading.
   "It was a stronger number than we were looking for . . .
and on the surface the report looks positive, but when you
look under the surface it is not as positive as it seems,"
said Daniel Friel, an economist for NCNB Corp. in Charlotte,
N.C.
   According to some analysts, the durable goods industry is
still demonstrating softness. Last month's climb in orders
was led by transportation equipment, which tends to fluctuate
widely from month to month. These bookings rose a strong 9.9%
in May, but didn't make up for the 13.5% decline in April.
The April decline followed a 24.1% increase in March. The
bulk of last month's increase came in bookings for airplanes,
although orders for automobiles increased strongly. Overall,
however, the automobile industry remains weak, said
economists.
   Excluding transportation, manufacturers' orders increased
only 1.8% in May and dropped 0.5% in April. Orders for
primary metals rose 2.2%, while orders for nonelectrical
machinery, which includes computers, surged 3.2%. Orders in
the electrical-machinery category fell 0.2%.
   Orders for nondefense capital goods -- which include the
increase in aircraft orders -- declined 1.4% in May, after a
10.5% plunge in the previous month. Overall, capital-goods
orders edged up 2.4%, following an 8.2% drop in April.
   Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4%, to $500.31
billion, compared with a 0.3% increase in April.
Manufacturers' shipments in May climbed 3.5%, to $126.12
billion, after a fall of 2.6% a month earlier.
   Last month's rise in personal income brought it to a
$4.701 trillion annual rate. Personal income increased 0.3%
in April, compared with a 0.8% rise in March.
   Americans saved 6.2% of their after-tax income last month,
compared with 6.0% in April and 6.3% in March.
   After adjusting for inflation, personal spending fell
0.3%, following a 0.4% rise in April and a 0.3% drop in
March.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal changes.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.
