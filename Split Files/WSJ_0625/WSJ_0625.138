   Snow Brand Milk Products Co., Japan's largest

yen ($124.3 million) from 21.534 billion yen a year earlier.

   Sales increased 5.4% to 968.89 billion yen from 918.85
billion yen.
   A spokesman attributed the slip in earnings largely to
increasing costs for domestic transportation, and said the
company also was hurt by rising prices for imported
materials, as a result of yen's decline in the fiscal fourth
quarter.
   Sales of milk, other drinks and yogurt, accounting for 26%
of sales, rose 6.2% to 274.18 billion yen. Sales of butter,
cheese and other dairy products made up 17% of total sales
and totaled 160.19 billion yen, up 4.8%.
   In the current fiscal year, Snow Brand expects sales of
1.01 trillion yen, consolidated pretax profit of 20 billion
yen and net income of 6.7 billion yen.
