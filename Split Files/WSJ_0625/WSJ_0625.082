   TOKYO -- Japanese banks have been granted a new means to
help meet international capital-adequacy requirements set by
the Bank for International Settlement.
   The Finance Ministry Friday allowed Japan's major banks
for the first time to raise funds through the issuance of
subordinated loans. However, the ministry kept unchanged its
prohibition on issuing subordinated bonds.

   The decision is viewed in Japan as very timely. Because of
the stock-market crash in Tokyo early this year, it has
become difficult for Japanese banks to raise equity levels to
meet higher BIS equity requirements, in part because of a
self-imposed ban by securities firms on underwriting new
equities. Instead, banks have had to restrain new lending,
particularly overseas.
   The BIS, based in Basel, Switzerland, is a sort of central
bank for central banks.
   The plunge in share prices not only has made it difficult
for banks to raise new funding in the capital markets but
also has reduced the value of the equities they hold in their
investment portfolios.
   Among major Japanese banks, Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd.
and three other instititutions failed at the end of their
latest accounting period to keep their debt-to-equity ratios
above the level that will be required by the BIS at the end
of March 1993. At that time, international banks are required
to maintain levels of equity above 8% of their total assets.
   An analyst at Nomura Research Institute, an affiliate of
Nomura Securities Co. says the subordinated loans are "a very
important means {of fund-raising} as they make it possible
for banks to raise capital quickly and systematically." But
he added that he doesn't expect any immediate sharp rise in
such loans. "Given the high cost," he says, "banks won't jump
for them until the time when they really need them comes, for
example perhaps at a time when they close their books for a
period and compile a report on the adequacy rate."
   Meanwhile, under the ministry's regulation, suppliers of
such loans are confined to insurance companies and financial
institutions, and banks are required to inform the ministry
of their borrowing each time before the deal is concluded.
The term of these loans is required to be set at five years
or longer.
   Analysts say subordinated borrowing by Japanese banks
during the current fiscal year, which will end next March 31,
could reach one trillion yen ($6.4 billion).
   The unsecured loan is already used in Britain, France,
Italy and other countries as a means to increase banks'
equity levels.
