   Circle K Corp., which is operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, said Bart A. Brown
Jr. was elected chairman.
   The post had been vacant since the May 7 resignation of
Karl Eller, who, as chairman and chief executive officer, led
the Phoenix, Ariz.-based convenience-store chain through a
period of frenzied and ultimately unsustainable growth.

   The 58-year-old Mr. Brown, a tax and business law
specialist, will take a leave of absence from the Cincinnati
law firm Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, where he is a senior
partner, a Circle K spokesman said.
   Keating Muething -- its past partners include Charles
Keating, the prominent onetime thrift executive -- is one of
the principal law firms for the Cincinnati financier Carl
Lindner's American Financial Corp. Mr. Lindner, through
American Financial and other interests, is Circle K's largest
shareholder, with a 38% stake, and a substantial creditor.
   William A. Franke, a Circle K director, said Mr. Brown was
chosen to be chairman because, "It was felt that he had the
necessary skills to manage a relatively large and complicated
rehabilitation."
   Circle K operates the nation's second-largest chain of
convenience stores. It filed last month for protection from
creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code, listing assets of $1.94 billion and
liabilities of $1.59 billion as of Jan. 31. Under Chapter 11,
a company continues to operate, while trying to work out
arrangements with creditors to pay its debts.
   Mr. Franke, a Phoenix investor, is the chairman of a newly
created, three-member "committee of independent directors" of
Circle K who aren't directly tied to Mr. Lindner. Circle K's
four other directors include Mr. Lindner and his son, Keith
E. Lindner. Mr. Franke said Mr. Brown has performed only "a
very limited amount of work for the Lindner interests" as a
partner at Keating Muething. Mr. Brown couldn't be reached to
comment.
   Mr. Franke said Mr. Brown will work on negotiations with
creditors, while Robert A. Dearth, who was named president
last January, will look after company operations. Mr. Franke
said the chief executive officer's post has been left vacant
since Mr. Eller's departure, because both Mr. Dearth and Mr.
Brown are new to the company.
