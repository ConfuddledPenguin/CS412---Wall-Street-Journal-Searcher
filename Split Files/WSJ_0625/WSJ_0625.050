   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Analysts say zinc and lead
prices are poised to rise sharply if new contracts aren't
reached this week at Canada's two largest producers, Cominco
Ltd. and Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting Corp.
   Contracts covering more than 4,600 members of the United
Steelworkers of America, including 3,500 at Cominco, and
1,140 at Brunswick, a unit of Toronto's Noranda Inc., expire
Saturday, and union bargainers said current contract
proposals from the two mining concerns are far from adequate.

   Negotiators appear especially far apart at Cominco, which
has had a stormy relationship with its unionized workers and
was hit with a costly four-month strike at its big Trail,
British Columbia, lead-zinc smelter complex in 1987 during
the previous round of contract talks.
   At its capacity, the Trail smelter accounts for about 5.8%
of the Western world's refined zinc output and 2.6% of its
lead production. Cominco's contract talks cover workers at
Trail and at British Columbia's Sullivan lead-zinc mine,
where output was suspended this year due to losses.
   "Metals markets have been holding their breath waiting for
the outcome of {Cominco's} talks," said Victor Lazarovici, an
analyst at Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc. With lead and zinc
supplies already hurt by disruptions, and inventories at low
levels, Mr. Lazarovici sees prices for both metals "going up
substantially" if settlements aren't reached.
   "We would very quickly go into a period of rising prices,"
concurred analyst Julian Baldry of Toronto's Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc.
   Mr. Lazarovici said zinc prices could reach or surpass the
early March peak of 85 cents (U.S.) a pound and lead would
quickly jump past 40 cents. Lead peaked at 60 cents a pound
in March. In London Metal Exchange spot market dealings
Friday, zinc closed at about 77 cents a pound and lead at
38.5 cents.
   Contract talks broke off late last week between Cominco
and union negotiators after the Vancouver company proposed a
two-year pact with annual wage increases of 5% but no
cost-of-living allowance, as the current contract provides.
   "Our members will reject this {proposal} by, I predict,
over 90%," said Ron Schmidt, chief bargainer for the
Steelworkers. "If you take the COLA away, with a 5% wage
increase, they'll be paying us the same damn thing" as under
the current pact, he said. "It's absolutely outrageous."
   Talks are expected to resume Thursday after union members
formally vote on the proposal and conduct a strike vote.
Under provincial law, the union must provide three days'
notice before going on strike.
   Meanwhile, union bargainers are also recommending a strike
at Brunswick, whose lead-zinc mine near Bathurst, New
Brunswick, is expected this year to produce metal concentrate
containing about 250,000 metric tons of zinc concentrate and
about 68,000 metric tons of lead, according to John White,
president and chief executive officer. That would account for
roughly 5% and 1.5% of Western world production of zinc and
lead, respectively.
   Workers are scheduled to vote this week on a proposed
three-year pact that Brunswick calls its final offer. It
includes a 20% wage boost over three years and increased
monthly pension payments, including a big immediate boost.
   But union negotiator Blair Doucet said the proposal is
inadequate and that the union wants to make up ground after
settling "cheap" in the last round of talks, which followed
several years of losses. "Now that they {Brunswick} are
making money, we want our share," he said.
   Last year, Brunswick earned 29.7 million Canadian dollars
(US$25.2 million), or 80 Canadian cents a share. It sees net
income rising to about 84 cents a share this year.
   If workers at Cominco and Brunswick come to terms without
resorting to strikes, analysts said lead and zinc prices
would probably fall from current levels, which partly reflect
anticipated supply disruptions. But they said underlying
demand for lead, which is mainly used to make batteries, is
strong, and there is little new production coming onstream,
largely because of environmental constraints.
   Strikes or not, "we're very optimistic on the outlook for
lead prices because the supply is so constrained," said BBN's
Mr. Lazarovici. As for zinc, he sees an immediate drop to
"the high 60s" (cents) range, if the contracts are settled.
