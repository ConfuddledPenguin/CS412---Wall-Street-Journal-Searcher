   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp.'s chairman and chief executive
officer, Charles Corry, said the company has had
"exploratory" discussions about the disposal of some of its
steel operations, but he played down the likelihood of any
impending sale.
   Mr. Corry, in his first interview since defeating the New
York investor Carl Icahn in a heated proxy battle regarding
the strategic course of the steel and energy concern, said:
"I personally believe it's easier to make money in energy.
Energy is our future."

   As for the steel business, which Mr. Icahn urged the
company to spin off as part of his May 7 shareholder
resolution that failed, Mr. Corry said foreign investors have
expressed interest in those operations. "We have had
discussions with respect to foreign parties who are
interested in various steel assets," he said.
   Among these parties, Mr. Corry said, is British Steel PLC,
which is shopping for a North American steelmaker. He said no
"specific" bids have been made. British Steel and USX tried
unsuccessfully to form a joint venture in 1983 at the
company's Fairless Hills, Pa., plant, near Philadelphia.
   Separately, Mr. Corry said second-quarter profit will top
that for the first quarter, when USX earned $176 million, or
66 cents a share. The improvement reflects higher operating
income in USX's steel and Marathon Oil segments.
   Though Mr. Corry declined to forecast net income for the
current period, he said operating income for Marathon Oil
will be higher than the year-earlier $257 million. But he
said he doesn't expect steel to better the $171 million in
operating income in the 1989 second quarter, when USX had net
income of $250 million, or 91 cents a share, which included
gains of $140 million from asset sales.
   In surveying USX's strategic direction, Mr. Corry conceded
that the company this year won't be able to buy back as much
stock or retire as much debt as had been hoped. USX said last
fall that it planned to sell the oil and gas reserves of its
disappointing Texas Oil &amp; Gas unit. At the time, the company
said the sale could generate at least $1 billion.
   Now, the company has taken about half of the reserves off
the market because of disappointing offers, and will sell
only three parcels of reserves, in California, the Gulf of
Mexico and the Arkansas-Oklahoma area. Sales of these
properties are expected to be completed in the third quarter,
yielding about $400 million.
   Mr. Corry said he doesn't feel any pressure to come up
with additional asset sales to offset the shortfall. He said
that, prior to this year, he expected the company would sell
about $1 billion of assets, but now anticipates this will
total about $500 million, including the Texas Oil &amp; Gas
reserves.
   This indicates little, if any, steel-related asset sales.
Mr. Corry approached discussion of the future of USX's steel
business gingerly. While noting that the company has
consistently reduced its exposure to steel every year, he
said, such actions don't mean USX will soon abandon its
position as the nation's No. 1 steelmaker.
   "We may well be operating that business in the year 2000,"
he said. As for reducing steel exposure this year, he said,
it depends "on what opportunities present themselves."
   One wild card this year is contract negotiations with the
United Steelworkers. The union negotiated contracts with four
leading steelmakers last year, patterned after one another in
wages and benefits. Mr. Corry called these contracts "rather
rich" and said he doesn't believe rival steelmakers have set
a pattern that USX must follow.
   Mr. Corry also said USX management isn't satisfied that
the company's stock price doesn't fully reflect record
earnings in 1989 and a significant about-face in the fortunes
of USX, once a symbol for industrial decay. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday, USX shares closed at
$32.125, unchanged. "There is some frustration with the price
of stock -- and it's not limited to shareholders," he said.
"Our stock performance suffers from the memories of the
1980s."
   Mr. Corry, though, was vague on what actions management
might take to bolster the share price. But he did note that
the board at its next meeting will give "serious
consideration" to a shareholder resolution, requesting a vote
on a provision that would discourage non-negotiated hostile
tender offers.
