   Machine tool orders placed with U.S. producers dropped
abruptly in May from the relatively high April rate, but
remained slightly above a year earlier. However, machine tool
distributors had a strong sales month.
   Industry executives say the disparity illustrates the
danger of placing too much importance on any single month's
figures. Machine tool producers say underlying demand is
relatively good, except from automotive and defense-related
customers.

   U.S. machine tool plants received $206.2 million of orders
last month, down 29% from April's $289.3 million, according
to NMTBA -- The Association for Manufacturing Technology, a
McLean, Va., trade group. However, orders remained slightly
above the $205.3 million of May 1989, and were about in line
with the monthly average for the final quarter of last year
and the first quarter of 1990.
   Machine tool distributors, who sell imported as well as
domestic machines, had an 8.8% order increase in May from a
year earlier, and a striking 38% jump from April, according
to the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association,
Rockville, Md. In April, however, distributor sales were
unusually weak, while U.S. machine tool factories had a good
month.
   Machine tools are sophisticated parts-making machines,
including lathes, machining centers and metal-forming
presses, and are bought mainly by factories that produce
durable goods. While plants that make machinery, household
appliances and other metal products are operating at
respectable rates right now, few are being pressed to add
capacity.
   That gives them time to shop for the most suitable
equipment to raise productivity, and there's a lot of
shopping going on, machine tool producers say. "Our activity
level is incredible," says Michael O. Harrington, vice
president, sales, for S.E. Huffman Corp., Clover, S.C.,
producer of specialized grinders, laser systems and water-jet
cutting equipment. But some customers will defer signing an
order until after the international machine tool show in
Chicago in September, he says.
   Buyers want to see the latest machines on display at the
show. Also, some will find it easier to justify the cost of a
trip to Chicago if they haven't already ordered the machines
they need.
   Some large machine tool users have more basic reasons to
hold off buying. Producers of cars, trucks and automotive
parts, for instance, continue to order cautiously, partly
because their own sales have been sluggish. Also, some
haven't yet decided what vehicles to produce in 1993 and
beyond in light of tightening governmental regulations on
fuel economy and exhaust emissions.
   Listening to the debate in Congress, it is becoming
increasingly clear that defense spending is going to be
slashed, machine tool executives add. Defense-oriented
aerospace concerns will soon have a lot of surplus capacity,
discouraging them from buying new machinery.
   However, other manufacturers are ordering machine tools to
increase plant productivity. "We're seeing order activity
from a good cross section of industry and from all across the
country," says Stephen M. Peterson, vice president, sales,
for Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis. "The oil patch
is coming back," and the company is getting orders from jet
engine manufacturers in the Northeast, machinery producers in
the Midwest and aerospace concerns on the West Coast. May
orders were higher than April, he says, and the proposal rate
is 20% higher than a year ago.
   Automotive companies are buying equipment to modernize
their tool and die shops, says Richard R. Burkhart, chairman
and chief executive officer of Pratt &amp; Whitney, West
Hartford, Conn. And some are placing orders for machines to
make a new generation of engines for 1993-model cars, he
says. But like most other producers, he says current orders
are lower than inquiry rates would indicate they should be.
   May orders for lathes, grinders, milling machines,
machining centers, boring mills and other machines to shape
metal by cutting were $137.6 million, the NMTBA said, down 7%
from $147.9 million a year earlier and off about one-third
from April's $206.7 million.
   Domestic producers of metal-forming presses and other
machines to shape metal with pressure received $68.7 million
of orders in May, up 20% from $57.4 million a year earlier
but 17% below April's $82.6 million.
   Machine tool shipments by U.S. plants totaled $272.6
million last month, up 13% from $240.8 million a year
earlier, the NMTBA said. The industry's backlog of unfilled
orders declined in May, as it has in four of the first five
months of 1990. At the end of the month, the backlog totaled
$1.65 billion, the NMTBA said, down 8.7% from the end of last
year and off 29% from the high for the current economic
expansion, which came in February 1989.
