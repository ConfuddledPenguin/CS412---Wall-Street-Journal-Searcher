   Growing concern about the health dangers of tobacco smoke
may mean that smoking in the office isn't just going out of
style. It may be going, going, gone.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose
today that secondhand smoke be declared a known human
carcinogen, on a par with nine other pollutants such as
asbestos and benzene. And the Labor Department's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration for the first time is
considering looking into "passive smoke" as a work hazard.

   Such federal interest is likely to increase public
pressure for wider bans on workplace smoking. While most
early efforts concentrated on segregating smokers at work or
banishing them to the lobby, moves for a "totally smoke-free"
environment now are coming into vogue.
   "Five years ago, companies needed to be motivated even to
look at a smoking policy," says Robert Rosner, whose
nonprofit Smoking Policy Institute in Seattle consults with
businesses on smoking policies. Now many companies want to
"prohibit smoking even on the grounds {and} refuse to hire
workers who smoke."
   At Turner Broadcasting System Inc., new hires must sign an
agreement attesting that they don't smoke or that they will
quit upon employment. The company is even considering going
further and banning smoking by all employees. But bans are
trickier than they sound. Anti-smoking policies run into
opposition from unions, as well as tobacco makers, and raise
legal questions such as how to enforce a ban.
   Although the EPA report due out today doesn't break new
scientific ground, because the agency and Surgeon General
already have branded passive smoking as causing lung cancer,
both anti-smoking and pro-smoking forces say it will supply
new momentum for the ban-smoking movement. The EPA report
estimates that 3,800 additional cases of lung cancer a year
are caused by breathing other people's smoke. The agency also
is likely to release a draft of a guidebook for employers on
curbing workplace smoking.
   The EPA report is "going to be significant in our efforts"
to win restrictions or prohibitions on workplace smoking,
says Angela Mickel, a lobbyist for Tobacco-Free America, a
group created by the American Cancer Society, American Heart
Association and American Lung Association.
   "The tobacco prohibitionists are certainly on a march,"
says Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the industry's Tobacco
Institute. Thanks to the EPA report, "we're going to see the
momentum for more restrictions on the workplace," he says.
   The EPA itself can't regulate smoking. But Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH), a Washington, D.C., group that has
fought many anti-smoking battles, says the agency's report
will bolster its current court case against OSHA, which has
twice rejected petitions seeking "emergency" curbs on
workplace smoking. "It puts an added burden on OSHA to
justify why they're not protecting employees from this
hazard," says Kathleen Scheg, an ASH lawyer. The Tobacco
Institute's Mr. Lauria agrees: "An official EPA edict would
make OSHA look at it even harder."
   Indeed, Gerard Scannell, OSHA's activist-minded new chief,
says he wants to raise the issue and indicates he'll rely on
the EPA report as a springboard. He says, "I think we have to
deal with the issue, but I need more information."
Eventually, OSHA will probably put out a "request for
information," that could lead to rules on workplace smoking,
he says, but "it's down the road before we do anything."
   But the anti-smoking movement isn't waiting for the
federal government. All but 13 states have laws restricting
smoking in public or private workplaces. According to
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a Berkeley, Calif., group
that works for anti-smoking legislation, at least 297 cities
and counties restrict workplace smoking.
   While the number of companies adopting anti-smoking
policies seems to be hitting a plateau, there's a surge in
interest in total bans. A 1989 survey of private and
government employers by the Administrative Management Society
found that 60% of employers surveyed restrict smoking and 25%
of those ban it, up from a year earlier when 57% said they
restricted smoking and 14% barred it.
   The EPA study is already having an effect. After news of
it leaked into the press last month, Ted Turner, chief
executive officer of Turner Broadcasting, asked his managers
to begin looking into a total ban on smoking for the
company's 3,700 employees. The Atlanta-based company's policy
of tobacco-free employees hired since November 1986 already
is one of the toughest around, and it's enforced. This year,
a newly hired lawyer who somehow wasn't made aware of the
policy lit up a cigarette in the office. She was given a
choice of leaving her job or enrolling in a quit-smoking
program. She ultimately left rather than quit smoking, says
William Shaw, vice president of corporate personnel
   In Akron, Ohio, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. also is
beginning to explore the idea of toughening its restrictions
on smoking by adopting a total ban at corporate headquarters.
Goodyear's chief industrial hygienist, Joseph Holtshouser,
says companies are being enticed to consider smoking bans
because it's good not only for the employees' health but
potentially for the corporate bottom line. Statistics show
that smokers have higher rates of absenteeism, lower
productivity and higher medical claims for themselves and
their families.
   While insurance companies generally have only begun to
offer discounts for nonsmokers on individual policies, King
County Medical Blue Shield in Seattle, Wash., broke new
ground this March by offering as much as a 15% discount on
group health policies to employers that ban smoking and can
certify that 90% of their work force are nonsmokers.
   Some other companies that now ban workplace smoking
entirely or except for certain lounges or cafeteria areas,
the Tobacco Institute says, include Ford Motor Co., in its
offices; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota; Manville
Corp., in Denver and Manville, N.J.; Kansas Gas &amp; Electric
Co.; U S West, in eight Northwest and Midwest states; Boeing
Co., in Seattle and Wichita, Kan.; Adolph Coors Co.; and
Deluxe Corp., in 66 locations.
   Tobacco companies are striving mightily to hold back the
smoking-ban movement, with partial success. The Tobacco
Institute has been able to help kill a number of state bills,
for instance. Philip Morris Cos., meanwhile, isn't leaving it
all to the institute. It's launched a campaign to challenge
the EPA report, including a news conference here Friday, to
tout several studies that play down the significance of
secondhand smoke.
   Some of the industry's success has come in getting some
states -- Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina and
Tennessee so far this year -- to pass laws variously
protecting workers from being fired or from hiring
discrimination for smoking. The Tennessee law prohibits job
discrimination against those who use "a legal agricultural
product" off the job.
   Tobacco interests have found some potent allies in labor
unions, who oppose government-ordered curbs and unilateral
employer actions alike. Unions helped defeat a recently
proposed Boston ordinance aimed at forcing employers to ban
smoking when compromise solutions can't be found, and a
Massachusetts bill with a similar goal. Unions complain that
such smoking limits undercut the collective-bargaining
process, where accommodations should be worked out. They also
aren't eager, some union officials say, to support edicts
that will anger many of their members.
   Another pocket of resistance sometimes is in offices of
top corporate executives, even at companies with no-smoking
policies. Chrysler Corp. bans smoking except in designated
areas, large work spaces such as garages and in private
offices. The last exemption allows Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, a
two-cigar-a-day smoker, and top executive Robert Lutz, who
also smokes cigars, to keep lighting up.
