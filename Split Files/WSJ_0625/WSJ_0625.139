   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Excalibur Automobile Corp., maker of
neoclassic automobiles fancied by wealthy collectors, has
suspended production after being rocked by layoffs, lawsuits,
bounced paychecks and allegations of mileage tampering.
   "If we could build 120 cars a year, we could be
profitable," said Scott Dennison, who became president of the
company June 1 after Henry A. Warner resigned.

   But the company has been producing just one car a week
since January and has a backlog of 76 vehicles. Layoffs this
month left only five of Excalibur's 45 workers on staff.
   The company has $2.1 million in loans outstanding, owes
$97,000 in overdue property taxes and owes thousands more to
unpaid workers and vendors.
   Mr. Dennison said his restructuring plans include buying
Mr. Warner's 59% stake, raising at least $500,000 in
additional capital for debt financing and operations and
proceeding with plans to find new markets.
