   NEW YORK -- As federal budget surgeons begin their annual
probe of health care spending, stock prices are languishing
at two health maintenance organizations that rely heavily on
Medicare.
   But even though analysts widely believe that
reimbursements won't sustain the double-digit increases of
the past two years, some say the outlook is brightening for
the two companies, FHP International and PacifiCare Health
Systems.

   In contrast to two other HMOs with less exposure to
Medicare, FHP and PacifiCare have been dead on arrival for
much of the year. Both stocks have faded, even as the shares
of U.S. Healthcare and United Healthcare blossomed.
   Haunting the two HMOs is the prospect that an increase in
Medicare reimbursements for 1991 -- which the government will
determine by September -- won't keep pace with this year's
unusually generous 13.4% rise. (About six percentage points
of that rise consisted of one-time payments to HMOs to cover
high-cost medical procedures.)
   Wall Street got wind in February that next year's payments
might fall short of expectations. In a private meeting with
HMO executives, Edmund C. Moy, director of the Health Care
Financing Administration's office of prepaid health care,
indicated that 1991 reimbursements might be flat at the least
or, at the most, up 7%. Some analysts had been expecting
higher increases, after two years of double-digit boosts.
   That meeting took the wind out of the sails of FHP, a
Fountain Valley, Calif., HMO that analysts expect to receive
about 65% of total revenue this year from the government's
reimbursements for Medicare patients. FHP's stock plunged 3
1/4 to 17 1/2 on more than one million shares Feb. 27, when
word of the lower prospects hit the Street. Shares of
PacifiCare tumbled 3 to 19 3/4 the same day; analysts expect
about 45% of the Cypress, Calif., company's 1990 revenue to
come from Medicare payments.
   "The apple cart was upset in February," says Janet Lyons,
an analyst with the $700 million Evergreen Fund of Purchase,
N.Y., which owns FHP shares. "The risk that reimbursements
won't be favorable already is in the price of the stock."
(Evergreen first bought FHP shares at 5 3/4 in 1987 and this
year acquired more when they dropped below 16; the stock was
at 18 Friday.)
   As of Friday, four analysts rated FHP a "strong buy," two
called it a "buy" and only one, Salomon Brothers, ranked it
"neutral," according to Zacks Investment Research Inc. Four
brokerage firms following PacifiCare all had "buy" opinions
on that stock.
   With health care costs expected to spiral 11% to 12% a
year for the next five years, HMOs "represent the ultimate
solution to our cost-containment problem, even though the
country does not believe it yet," says health services
analyst Kenneth S. Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   America's ambivalence toward HMOs is based on several
factors, Mr. Ambramowitz says. Many major corporations are
self-insured or have long-established relationships with
insurers. HMOs reduce patient freedom, steering large amounts
of business to contracted providers. Physicians, hospitals
and other providers "generally hate HMOs" because they force
them to provide care under budgeted formulas, Mr. Abramowitz
adds.
   Nevertheless, HMOs will look attractive to companies,
particularly if the HMO costs continue to grow at 12% to 15%
annually compared with insurers' 18% to 22%, he says.
   "I've never cared for Medicare exposure," says Salomon
health services analyst Margo L. Vignola. She rates FHP a
"neutral;" she doesn't follow PacifiCare. She prefers instead
the strong earnings momentum of U.S. Healthcare, a Blue Bell,
Pa., organization with prospects for growth in the huge New
York market, and the diversified services of United
Healthcare, Minnetonka, Minn.
   FHP and PacifiCare have had other concerns besides
Medicare reimbursements. FHP has been paying to house some
patients at other sites since it ran out of room and hasn't
completed a new hospital, notes Amy de Rham, a portfolio
analyst with Massachusetts Financial Services, Boston. Ms. de
Rham, however, calls the strong earnings of U.S. Healthcare
and United Healthcare "compelling stories."
   As Washington officials begin to hone the federal budget,
a few analysts think investors may get a bullish surprise.
"The government clearly wants to put Medicare patients into
HMOs," says analyst Todd Richter of Dean Witter Reynolds, who
predicts a 3% to 7% rise in Medicare reimbursements. "They
get a much better benefits package and a much simpler
system."
   Prudential-Bache analyst Seth Shaw agrees. "I don't think
the administration wants the political and economic upheaval
that a 0% to 3% increase would bring about," he says. He
expects a 6% to 7% increase in reimbursements.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Over-the-counter stocks lost ground in the last hour of
trading as a flood of computer-driven sell programs drove
exchange-listed shares lower.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.94 Friday to 459.33, a
0.42% loss. Volume rose to 167.5 million shares from 144.3
million Thursday. Declining stocks overtook advancers, 1,023
to 872.
   Intermec plunged 3 1/8 to 13 1/8 on nearly 1.1 million
shares, more than five times average volume. The Everett,
Wash., maker of bar coding and other printing products said
it may report little or no profit for the first quarter,
ending Saturday, compared with net income of 28 cents a share
a year earlier. Intermec cited weak sales to the military and
the expense of moving to new facilities.
