   ERIE, Pa. -- Zurn Industries Inc. said it was awarded two
contracts totaling $65 million from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California.
   Next month, Zurn said, its Advanco Construction unit will
begin constructing the Etiwanda Pipeline Feeder, one of the
two projects.

   It involves installing more than six miles of
12-foot-diameter pipe in Rancho Cucamonga and Fontana, Calif.
Included in the project are five tunnels under roadways. The
project is expected to be completed by March 1992, Zurn said.
   Advanco also will build the Etiwanda Control Facility. The
450-foot water reservoir and control facility will intercept
and regulate water flow from the Etiwanda feeder and
distribute it to various water treatment and supply
locations.
   Zurn said Advanco will construct its powerhouse building,
pressure control structure and outlet structure. That project
is expected to be completed in April 1992.
