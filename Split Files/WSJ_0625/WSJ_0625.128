   MONTREAL -- Quebec's political leaders said the
French-speaking province will draw up its own terms and
conditions for staying in Canada after the collapse of a
constitutional plan to recognize Quebec as a "distinct
society."
   Premier Robert Bourassa said the province will begin a
public debate this autumn on its role within Canada. He gave
no hint of what demands his government will make but wouldn't
rule anything out. "Quebec is free to choose," Mr. Bourassa
said, adding that "in all these decisions, Quebec's own
interests will be the determing factor."

   The proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord died after
two provinces, Newfoundland and Manitoba, failed to ratify it
by a Saturday deadline. The other eight provinces and the
federal Parliament ratified the agreement, but it required
unanimous approval.
   Mr. Bourassa is under pressure from the opposition Parti
Quebecois, which wants independence for the province. In a
televised address, Mr. Bourassa said Quebec must debate its
future "calmly, lucidly and with realism" and promised to
avoid any sudden moves that would scare off foreign
investors.
   Mr. Bourassa, a 54-year-old economist, is worried about
the reaction of financial markets to the death of the
constitutional accord. A senior aide said that if market
reaction is too negative, the premier will take special steps
to reassure investors. He didn't elaborate.
   After the address, Mr. Bourassa reiterated the safety of
investing in Quebec and said he wouldn't make "any decisions
{adversely} affecting the economic security of Quebecers."
   Although foreign exchange traders expected the Canadian
dollar to drop today because of the constitutional impasse,
they said the fall would be cushioned by the country's high
short-term interest rates. Canadian 91-day Treasury bills
yielded 13.55% late Friday, compared with less than 8% for
similar U.S. instruments. "That's a big chunk of
exchange-rate protection," said Barry Davenport, vice
president, foreign exchange, at Bank of Montreal.
   Like several other other big Canadian dealers, Bank of
Montreal assigned extra staff to their trading desks last
night in anticipation of heavy Canadian-dollar trading as
soon as markets opened in Asia and the Pacific.
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said investors
shouldn't overreact to the failure of the Meech Lake accord.
"Canada is still a very strong economy and stable place to
live, invest and do business," he said in an interview.
   Political analysts said the collapse of the constitutional
agreement was a serious political blow for Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, who was widely seen as having created a
crisis atmosphere to pressure the holdout provinces to ratify
the accord. "Mr. Mulroney highlighted the worst-case scenario
as part of his strategy," said Joe Ghiz, premier of Prince
Edward Island.
   Two days after warning that failure to ratify Meech Lake
would send "negative signals to international markets," Mr.
Mulroney on Saturday urged Canada's "friends and partners"
abroad to stay calm. "Canadians have always overcome
challenges to our unity, and we shall do so again," a haggard
Mr. Mulroney said in a televised speech.
   "Everyone is trying to put the best face on things," said
Dalton Camp, a former senior Mulroney adviser. "But there is
no question that this is a serious situation."
