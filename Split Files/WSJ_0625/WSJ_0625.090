   MIDLANTIC Corp. (Edison, N.J.) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
said it lowered its ratings on debt of this bank holding
company and certain units, including about $426 million of
long-term debt outstanding. "The downgrades reflect the
serious erosion in asset quality in recent months, due
largely to the downturn in the New Jersey real estate
market," the rating concern said. S&amp;P's rating on senior debt
of the parent and its Midlantic Banks Inc. affiliate was
lowered to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus. The rating on
Midlantic Corp.'s subordinated debt was downgraded to
double-B-plus from triple-B. The Midlantic Funding Corp.
unit's commercial paper rating was reduced to single-A-3 from
single-A-2.
