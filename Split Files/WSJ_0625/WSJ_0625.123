   McFarland Energy Inc. said it realized a cash gain of
about $3.4 million from the $3.8 million sale to Nerco Inc.
of a 6% working interest in the Trimble Field in Mississippi.
   McFarland Energy, based in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., said
it probably will use the cash to pay down debt. The gain,
however, won't appear as net income because McFarland Energy
uses so-called "full-cost" accounting, under which
exploration and development expenditures are pooled and
depreciated over time, J.C. McFarland, president and chief
executive officer, said.

   McFarland's stake in the Trimble field was part of a $67
million purchase by Nerco earlier last week that gave Nerco,
a unit of PacifiCorp, an 80% working interest in the field.
   McFarland's stake in the field equaled 2.3 billion cubic
feet of natural gas, about 23% of the company's net proven,
developed gas reserves.
