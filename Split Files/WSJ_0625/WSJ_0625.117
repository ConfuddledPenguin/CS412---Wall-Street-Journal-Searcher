   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said shareholders of Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. approved the merger of the Norwalk, Conn.-based
company with NM Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific.
   Georgia-Pacific, a forest products concern, said it
expects the merger to take effect this week upon the filing
of merger documents in Maine and Delaware, where Nekoosa and
NM Acquisition, respectively, are incorporated.

   After the merger, Nekoosa, a wood products concern, will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific.
Georgia-Pacific said Nekoosa shareholders will then be sent
documents telling them how to surrender their shares for a
cash payment of $65.75 a share.
