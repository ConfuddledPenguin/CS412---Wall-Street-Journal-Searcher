   Arizona Students Learn
   The Score on Swindlers

   THE CAVEAT should now be: "Swindler, beware." Consumers
and investors in the next generation may not be such easy
prey for your scams -- at least not in Arizona.
   Teachers in 200 Arizona high schools last year used video
dramatizations of real swindles to teach 12th graders how to
detect fraud. Created by the securities division of the
Arizona Corporation Commission, the three 22-minute films
show the zeal of con artists and the devastation of conned
investors in tales of "boiler-room" scams, pyramid schemes
and other swindles.
   The idea came from Matthew Zale, a Phoenix attorney who
worked for 12 years as a litigator for the Securities and
Exchange Commission and for 13 years as director of the
Arizona securities division. He says his frustration with
"traditional methods of law enforcement" inspired him to seek
new ways to fight fraud.
   "After so many years of putting these boiler-room cons in
jail, I became convinced the fraud would go on forever unless
the public became better informed," Mr. Zale says. "By making
films and showing the slimy guys in their element, I wanted
to convey to others the horror of what I had seen."
   Funding for the films came from a $300,000 settlement paid
by E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. to settle state securities charges.
   Says Tracy Lewis, a teacher at Chaparral High School in
Scottsdale: "Some (students) suddenly realized they were
inadvertently involved in a scam during a summer job. . . .
I'll be really amazed if any of my students is ever a victim
of any scam in their lives. They know the score now."
                                                                                                       

   States Lack Funds to Deal
   With Rising Elder Abuse
                                                                                                       

   REPORTED INCIDENTS of elder abuse have increased
approximately 50% since 1980, to 1.5 million in 1989.
   This year, according to the House Select Committee on
Aging, one of every 20 elderly people will be a victim of
physical, psychological or financial abuse.
   Part of the jump can be attributed to increased reporting
because of heightened public awareness and new mandatory
reporting laws in some states. In 1980, only 16 states had
such laws; now 43 states do.
   Still, many states don't have the funding to enforce their
reporting laws nor can they afford to staff agencies to deal
with the abuse. In most states, only one out of eight cases
of elder abuse is reported, compared with one out of three
child-abuse cases, the committee says. States spend an
average of $3.80 on protective services for each elderly
victim, as opposed to $45 for each allegedly abused child.
   In recent testimony before the House Subcommittee on
Health and Long-Term Care, Scott Harshbarger, district
attorney for Middlesex County, Mass., and an advocate for the
elderly, said: "Five years ago I testified . . . that I
feared we would soon learn that the tragedy of child abuse
would pale in comparison to the systematic familial abuse of
older Americans. Unfortunately, the prediction was accurate."
   The subcommittee is sponsoring a bill that would allocate
a total of $10 million to state agencies coping with elder
abuse. The bill also provides funds for a national research
center on the issue.
                                                                                                       

   Next: Collaring Cats
   To Protect the Populace
                                                                                                       

   LEASH LAWS for cats? Don't laugh. Big jury awards for
victims of dog attacks have inspired stricter dog laws. Cats
may be next.
   In Los Angeles Superior Court last month, a jury awarded
$1 million to the victim of an allegedly ferocious feline. In
what many lawyers believe to be the nation's first cat-attack
trial, the jury decided that a small black cat known to stalk
and scratch female tenants at a Hollywood apartment complex
was to blame for a tenant's nasty fall.
   Liability for the serial scratcher, said the jury, lies
with the complex's owner and manager, both of whom denied
owning the cat. Photos presented as evidence, however, showed
plastic bowls outside the manager's door filled with what the
jury apparently believed was cat food.
   The plaintiff, 61-year-old Mary Cockrell, and other
tenants testified that the cat was vicious. One said it would
reach through slats of poolside chairs to scratch the ankles
of hapless sunbathers.
   Ms. Cockrell testified that once as she was walking
downstairs, the cat reached through the space between two
steps and grabbed her ankle. She said that when she asked the
apartment manager to get rid of the cat, he refused.
   Then one day, Ms. Cockrell testified, she was so startled
by the cat's sudden appearance that, in turning to flee, she
fell and ruptured a disk in her lower back.
   The defendants couldn't be reached for comment. A hearing
is set for today to discuss their motion for a new trial
based on a claim of excessive damages and insufficient
evidence.
   As for the cat, Ms. Cockrell's Los Angeles attorney,
Edward Barker, said: "After the accident, the owner told the
manager to get rid of the cat. He chased it away, and
nobody's seen it since."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SUPERIOR COURT Judge Lawrence Fleishman of Pima County,
Ariz., ordered a convicted real estate swindler to appear on
TV as part of a four-year probationary term. "Niles Thim: How
I stole $9.2 million," will be aired on KGUN-TV, the ABC
affiliate in Tucson. . . . Since 1898, the town clock in
Hatfield, Mass., has chimed hourly. No more. Two newcomers
who moved in 75 feet away from the clock -- while it was
stopped for repairs -- filed suit. After a local jury found
the noise was a nuisance, a judge ruled that the bell can no
longer ring at night.
