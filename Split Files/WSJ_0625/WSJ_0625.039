   Standing before his judge in January 1945, Helmuth James
von Moltke, a leading member of the German resistance, saw
himself "not as a Protestant, not as a big landowner, not as
a nobleman, not as a Prussian, not as a German -- but as a
Christian and nothing else." The judge, a former communist
named Roland Freiser, understood. "One thing Christianity and
we National Socialists have in common," he intoned, "and only
one: We demand the whole man."
   The essence of the trial is recounted in the remarkable
"Letters to Freya, 1939-1945" (Knopf, 441 pages, $24.95),
edited and translated by Beate Ruhm von Oppen. During those
years, the great-nephew of Bismarck's field marshall worked
in Berlin at the foreign division of the Abwehr (the German
intelligence service) as a legal adviser to the High Command
of the Armed Services.

   His wife, Freya, meanwhile was raising their two small
sons and looking after the family estate at Kreisau in
Silesia. They exchanged letters almost daily, and she plied
him with poppyseed cake and farm-fresh fruit, vegetables and
fowl.
   During the 1930s Moltke raised a Cassandra's voice to
prevent war, haranguing politicians, journalists and clerics
in Britain and elsewhere on the futility of appeasement.
Then, in the early war years, having just breezed through his
English bar exams, he applied his professional capacities at
home, trying to prevent German violations of international
law and to protect neutrals. Persistence and pragmatism,
Moltke found, won out over ethical reasoning. "What is
international law is good for the conduct of war," he would
argue. In one instance, he argued against Field Marshall
Keitel's order to shackle prisoners of war, until Hitler
relented.
   Early on he knew instinctively that Germany had
next-to-nil prospects of winning the war and thus viewed it
as perversely barbaric. "Germans seem to have a pronounced
gift for tactics, and seem to be hopeless at strategy," he
wrote in April 1940. Hitler's generals refused to acknowledge
Anglo-Saxon naval supremacy and Soviet "invincibility,"
according to Moltke, and "what the Russians lacked in will
our measures have instilled in them."
   Moltke foresaw a "blood-guilt that cannot be atoned for in
our lifetime," yet even he had difficulty believing the
unimaginable as it unfolded: the startup of S.S. furnaces in
which "6,000 people a day are `processed.' " When he saw a
report blaming the Russians for using dumdum bullets that
astonishingly was "supported by evidence of the medical
officer, one Panning, who used the ammunition in a
large-scale experimental execution of Jews," he wanted only
"to see Herr Panning before a court of law."
   Moltke became a central figure in the secret working group
that came to be known as the Kreisau Circle. It hoped, as Ms.
von Oppen states in the introduction, to restore after the
war "the sense of humanity to people who had experienced its
destruction." The group, which included Social Democrats,
trade unionists and churchmen, dealt with political
structure, education, church-state relations, the punishment
of war criminals and the Europeanization of a federal
Germany.
   Moltke opposed schemes for a "coup d'etat", Ms. von Oppen
writes, for fear of "a new legend of stab-in-the-back, like
the one that had done so much political harm in Germany after
1918." The revenge that followed the assassination attempt
against Hitler on July 1, 1944, cost the lives of many within
and outside the Kreisau Circle.
   Insights on the war aside, what makes the collection
particularly enriching is the portrait that emerges of a
special man during special circumstances: an aristocrat of
extraordinary depth of intellect and sentiment who served his
family, nation and God as an incorruptible humanist.
   The letters are a constant reflection of their author's
frame of mind. Seeking comfort in Kant, Spinoza and Mozart
while yearning to be home in Kreisau, he resisted any impulse
to lapse into callousness. "I'm always catching myself at
it," he wrote. Having to return the obligatory raised-hand
salutes repulsed him as much as the coarse behavior of some
of his countrymen he encountered in his travels.
   As the war soured, Moltke sensed danger. Codes began to
displace names in the letters. "What a year lies before us,"
the first letter in 1944 opened. "If we survive it all other
years will pale beside it." Before the month was out he was
arrested. His letters later that year from Tegel prison --
written in handcuffs and smuggled out by a chaplain, Harald
Poelchau -- revealed a man preparing for death. "Now I
definitely don't want to die, there's no doubt about that,"
he wrote. Yet he accepted his fate in the knowledge "of being
killed for something which (a) we really have done and which
(b) is worthwhile. . . . we are to be hanged because we
thought together."
   On Jan. 11, 1945, 12 days before his execution, Moltke
took his leave from Freya: "Only together do we constitute a
human being," he wrote. "Therefore, my love, I am certain
that you will not lose me on this earth, not for a moment."
