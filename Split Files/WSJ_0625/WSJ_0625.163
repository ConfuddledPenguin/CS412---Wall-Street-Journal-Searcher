   WASHINGTON -- Financier Lewis Ranieri strengthened his
savings-and-loan holdings in Dallas, acquiring Metropolitan
Financial Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association in one of 25
sales and liquidations of insolvent thrifts announced by the
government Friday.
   Mr. Ranieri's United Savings Association of the Southwest,
Houston, will pay a $15.6 million premium to Resolution Trust
Corp., the S&amp;L cleanup agency, to assume Metropolitan's $732
million in deposits. United Savings also will purchase $432
million of the Dallas thrift's $800 million in assets and
will have one year to return any that have bad underwriting
or other defects.

   The RTC will advance $308 million to United Savings and
hold the remaining bad investments of Metropolitan. Once
those are sold, the RTC expects its net cost in the deal to
be $259 million. The agency received three proposals for the
sale of Metropolitan.
   United Savings, which has $3.5 billion in assets, also
recently acquired Murray Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association,
a $1.1 billion-asset thrift in Dallas, from the RTC.
   In all the transactions announced Friday, the government
will hold all the bad investments of the thrifts it sold.
Buyers of the institutions will have options to hold
performing assets for various periods and may return them to
the government.
   Kilgore Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Kilgore,
Texas, which was a $156 million-asset thrift last year,
acquired three north Texas thrifts from the agency with total
assets of $419.2 million. The three are Taylorbanc Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, Taylor, with $138.2 million in
assets; Denton Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Denton,
with $160.8 million in assets; and First Garland Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, Garland, with $120.2 million in
assets.
   Kilgore was the only bidder for the thrifts, although the
RTC solicited more than 100 bids on each, it said. The agency
expects, after its sales of the thrift assets, to incur a
loss of $88 million on the sale.
   Other transactions Friday included:
   -- Anchor Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Kansas City,
Kan., with $645.8 million in assets, was sold to Bank IV
