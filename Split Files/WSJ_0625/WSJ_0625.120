   Since Tyson Foods swallowed Holly Farms last August along
with a big side dish of debt, the poultry processor has
posted three quarterly per-share earnings gains ranging from
13% to 23%. Tyson's stock has followed suit with a 36% jump
since the acquisition to $32.75 Friday.
   The impressive numbers have sparked some glowing reviews.
But other inquiring analysts want to know: Why did the
company decide to change its depreciation schedule recently?
And will a threatened cyclical downturn in poultry prices
affect the company's ability to digest the $1.3 billion of
long-term debt it absorbed in the acquisition? "They
leveraged their souls to get {the Holly deal} done," says
Craig Carver, a Dain Bosworth analyst in Minneapolis.
"They'll need continued luck now."

   Some analysts were taken aback when the company in its
second quarter, ended March 31, changed the depreciation
schedule it uses to write off the cost of poultry-processing
equipment, switching to 10 years from six years. The result:
Per-share net income rose 18% in the period, to 40 cents from
34 cents, despite the huge increase in debt. Without
stretching out the depreciation schedule, per-share net would
have dipped about 10%.
   Tyson's vice president and treasurer, Wayne Britt, says
Tyson made the change because Holly had been using a longer
equipment life for its depreciation than Tyson did. "We
picked something in between," he said. "You can't
characterize it as a move for an impact on earnings."
   But analysts aren't so sure. "You can question the timing
of the decision to change from six years to 10" because the
move coincides with the increase in debt payments, says John
McMillin at Prudential-Bache Securities. The accounting
change means the company "will show an earnings gain, but not
of the highest quality."
   Tyson has had some luck since it began pursuing Holly in
1988. Rising prices for beef and pork helped boost chicken
prices. Operating profit margins on chicken processing have
averaged about 11 cents a pound this year compared with about
eight cents a pound for the first five months of 1989. In
addition, chicken exports have risen, and Tyson received 63%
of an early May Soviet order for 50,000 metric tons of
poultry.
   But a down cycle may be just around the corner. Many new
poultry plants are coming on line, probably by 1991. Meat
industry experts also expect an increase in supplies of beef
and pork by then. Profit margins may already be on a
downtrend; in May, chicken producers' profit margins slipped
to three cents a pound from 10 cents a year ago.
   Still, says Mr. McMillin, "I don't think {Chairman} Don
Tyson will become the next Don Trump," referring to the
developer's liquidity crisis due to his highly leveraged
investments. Tyson's pretax cash flow in 1990 is expected to
be three times its interest payments.
   Tyson says it has become quite comfortable with its debt
load, even though the debt is the largest it has ever carried
and is considerably higher than that of other poultry and
meatpacking companies. Tyson's debt is currently about 2.8
times its equity.
   With the completion of the Holly deal, "we've learned to
use leverage," says Tyson's Mr. Britt. Nevertheless, Tyson is
trying to reduce debt. Recently it sold about $175 million of
accounts receivable to shrink its revolving credit line and
bank debt. The move will save about $3 million a year in
interest payments, which now total about $140 million
annually.
   It also plans to sell 2.6 million Class A common shares in
the next few weeks. (The company's controlling Class B stock
is held by Mr. Tyson and his family.) The new shares will
reduce the company's $1.3 billion in long-term debt by only
about $100 million. But, says Mr. Britt, the offering won't
dilute per-share earnings, because proceeds from the sale
will reduce interest payments just enough to make up for the
slight increase in shares outstanding.
   Many analysts say they aren't able to comment on the
company's debt or its stock offering because their firms plan
to sell the stock. But just prior to the offering, many of
them were recommending the stock for buyers with long-term
objectives, while several others, including Mr. Carver, rated
the stock a "hold."
   Mr. McMillin of Prudential-Bache, however, thinks the
stock is a little overpriced. Tyson, he acknowledges, is the
most stable of the chicken producers because much of its
business is in food-service sales, which are less prone to
rise and fall with the commodity chicken price cycles.
Nevertheless, he says, "for a chicken company to be selling
at 11 times cash flow is crazy."
