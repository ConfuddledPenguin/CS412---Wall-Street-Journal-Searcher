   BOSTON -- Americana Hotels &amp; Realty Corp. said it plans to
distribute about $3.50 a share to holders under its
previously announced plan of liquidation.
   The real estate investment trust said the distribution
would be made upon its collection of a $15.5 million note
receivable on a hotel or upon the sale of another "major"
asset. Americana made a previous liquidating distribution of
$8 a share last August.
