   Kumagai Gumi Co., a major Japanese construction company,
predicted that its profit in the fiscal 1990, ending March
31, would drop mainly because of higher running costs in the
U.S.
   It estimated that pretax earnings would fall 10.3%, to
around 41 billion yen ($265 million) from 45.685 billion yen
in the past fiscal year, and net profit 9.9% to 14 billion
yen from 15.523 billion yen.

   Kumagai Gumi officials said their company projected lower
profit because of expectations of growing costs to maintain
buildings in the U.S. after they are built.
   "If we can sell them earlier, that will, of course, make a
difference in the running costs," one official said. "Right
now, however, we expect the costs to grow and pressure
profits down."
   Fiscal 1990 sales are estimated at about 1.4 trillion yen,
a 9.5% gain from 1.187 trillion yen in the previous fiscal
year.
   Kumagai Gumi changed its fiscal year to begin April 1. As
a result, its fiscal 1988 covers only six months, making
comparisons with fiscal 1990 results difficult.
   In the truncated fiscal 1988, pretax earnings totaled
14.147 billion yen and net income 4.057 billion yen. Sales in
the six months were 483.249 billion yen.
