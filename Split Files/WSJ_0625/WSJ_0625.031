   In October of 1986, three women were transferred to a
high-security compound of the Lexington (Ky.) federal prison.
Locked away in underground cell blocks, they were subjected
to daily strip searches, 24-hour surveillance and almost
total isolation. The Department of Prisons says it was a
necessary precaution to keep high-risk cases from escaping.
The women say it was an experiment in sensory deprivation --
a form of psychological torture.
   "Through the Wire" (PBS, Tuesday, June 26, 10 p.m. EDT;
check local listings), the first of this season's "P.O.V."
series, is a film that's sure to upset almost everyone.
Filmmaker Nina Rosenblum's persuasive allegations come as a
shock: Not just in Iraq or in Mexico, she insists, but here
in America political prisoners do exist, and they're singled
out for especially harsh treatment in federal jails. The
90-minute documentary, narrated by Susan Sarandon, traces the
story of three women incarcerated in a prison within a
prison, a "living tomb": Susan Rosenberg, Sylvia Baraldini
and Alejandrina Torres.

   All three came out of the 1960s and '70s protest
movements. All three were home-grown terrorists. Rosenberg,
who grew up in a liberal, middle-class home, got involved in
anti-war and black-power groups and eventually joined the May
19 Communist Organization. In 1985, she was linked to the
Brinks robbery, and convicted of possession of weapons and
explosives (dynamite). She was sentenced to 58 years in
prison.
   Baraldini, daughter of an Italian embassy employee, grew
up in the U.S. and also was involved in anti-Vietnam and
pro-black groups, and a member of the May 19 Communist
Organization. She was convicted of conspiracy to help black
militant Asata Shakur escape from jail, and sentenced to 43
years.
   Torres, a member of the radical Puerto Rican independence
movement FALN, was convicted of "seditious conspiracy" to
bomb a U.S. Marine base near Chicago, and received a sentence
of 35 years. She considers herself a prisoner of war.
   Though these women all advocated armed struggle, it is
important to point out that none of them was convicted of
actually committing any violent act -- not assault, not
bombing, not kidnapping, and certainly not murder. Yet
Rosenberg, for example, was given a 58-year sentence, twice
as long as the average murderer receives. In comparison, a
man recently convicted of actually bombing an abortion clinic
was given a seven-year sentence, and Ku Klux Klan Grand
Wizard Don Black, caught with an arsenal not unlike
Rosenberg's, was released in 23 months.
   While there is no denying their criminal involvement, it
is interesting that these three fiercely political women --
and not killers -- were the ones chosen to be buried in
subterranean pens in Kentucky, isolated from the general
prison population. "They don't want us in the general
population," says Rosenberg. "We have a different moral code.
We conduct ourselves with dignity. . . ."
   The women's lawyers make the case that this treatment was
in fact similar to the "sensory deprivation" jails of West
Germany, used to crack the Baader-Meinhof prisoners: no
contact with the outside world, no sun, no grass, no books,
frequent nocturnal wakings. Doctors and outside prison
experts attest to the women's rapidly deteriorating condition
over their two-year incarceration. Particularly brutal and
degrading strip-searches are described. "The most miserable
and dangerous of violent criminals gets a better shake than
these women," says criminologist Richard Korn, who wrote the
textbook on the isolation technique.
   Full of passionate intensity, "Through the Wire" is a
classic point-of-view documentary, both in its strengths and
its weaknesses. This film obviously cares deeply about its
subject. It's also long, rambling and incredibly sloppy.
   Marred by second-rate journalism, "Through the Wire"
leaves too many unanswered questions: Are there any such
units for men? Were women first? Why? The interviews with
prison officials are particularly skimpy. Even if they're
only being set up as straw men, let's hear their full
official explanation for such facilities. And especially as a
partisan interviewer, why not push the warden a little on
camera: How come these women can't be let outside once in a
while to see the sun? Why can't they be allowed to read
books?
   There are all sorts of ways to do muckraking journalism,
from "60 Minutes" to "Titicut Follies," the classic expose of
mental institutions. All of them are heavy on facts, not just
allegations. In this film, the one central allegation -- that
this treatment is part of an Orwellian experiment to "break"
political prisoners -- is never substantiated, only "proved"
by repeated assertions.
   Ms. Rosenblum's basic problem is that she couldn't get her
camera inside the unit; she couldn't get any footage of the
women's day-to-day existence. In some cases, she's forced to
use simulations. She's simply short of pictures.
   On the other hand, she has tons of interview footage with
her three radicals making accusations, and she feels
compelled to use it all. It's an especially bad choice to
have the women prisoners tell their own stories (instead of
having the narrator do it), because they come off as so
unreliable. Their sentences are littered with phrases like
"the struggle," "the movement" and the U.S. government's plan
for "chemical genocide against blacks and the poor."
   In fact, there is some solid evidence that supports some
of their contentions of cruel and unusual punishment --
corroborating reports from Amnesty International, doctors and
psychologists. There's also a particularly important decision
by a federal court judge.
   But those facts are lost in the middle of this rambling
film. "Through the Wire" lurches off in three or four
different directions at once. Is this a history of the 1960s?
A portrait of three radicals in a non-radical age (complete
with home movies and parental interviews)? An expose of
prisons? An indictment of the government? Instead of a
streamlined, powerful 45-minute film, this 90-minute affair
seems at once bloated and underreported. "Through the Wire"
needed an editor in the worst way.
   It's great to see the "P.O.V." series stirring up trouble.
And "Through the Wire" isn't a bad choice. It tells a sad
story -- a story there's no reason to think won't be repeated
in the future. But I kept thinking what a good job "60
Minutes" would have done with this material.
