   AMMAN, Jordan -- King Hussein, alarmed by rising Middle
East friction, said the region is approaching the same state
of hair-trigger tension that led to the outbreak of an
Arab-Israeli war in 1967.
   "We are at the most dangerous crossroads we have found
ourselves in the 37 years of my life serving in this area,"
he said in an interview.

   The 54-year-old monarch, who led Jordan into that war,
seemed almost resigned to another war as he dispassionately
listed what he sees as U.S. missteps that have led to a
decline in Arab-Israeli relations. He called for an urgent
reassessment of U.S. Mideast policy. The point that now has
been reached, he said, echoes all too closely the June 1967
situation: rising tension, righteous rhetoric and, finally,
rash action.
   "The 1967 situation was a trap set by Israel into which
the Arabs fell," he said, "and I'm afraid this situation is
very similar." Asked if the Arabs may again fall into war,
the king said, "They may have no other choice."
   It is this fear of inexorable collision between frustrated
Arabs and a seemingly frozen Israeli government that is
producing widespread talk of a new Mideast war. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's repeated declaration that Iraq
will retaliate if Israel strikes also has heightened war
talk. Jordanian officials believe Israel soon will hit Libya
to retaliate for a recent abortive guerrilla raid on the
Israeli coast.
   With a photograph of the Iraqi president just behind his
shoulder, King Hussein, a longtime U.S. ally and Arab
moderate, laid out his own alarmist assessment in the
comfortable sitting room of his palace.
   As the king sees it, the winds of change that brought
freedom and human rights to Eastern Europe have brought
Palestinians nothing but a flood of Soviet Jewish immigrants
who may push them out of their land -- something he says the
U.S. refuses to see. That plus the election of a hard-line
government in Israel and the U.S.'s suspension last week of
its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization have
combined to raise Arab "anger and frustration," he said.
   His own frustration with the Bush administration is
clearly rising, too. In March, the monarch expressed faith in
the president's knowledge of the region and said he was the
right man at the right time to bring progress towards peace.
Now, he says he can't distinguish between President Bush and
President Reagan, who never visited the Middle East and who
was widely perceived by Arabs to be biased toward Israel.
   He listed what he called U.S. missteps dating from former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's theory that a stronger
Israel would be a more moderate Israel to Vice President Dan
Quayle's recent adoption of the Israeli terms Judea and
Samaria in referring to the occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River.
   "My honest concern is that if the U.S. doesn't reassess
the current problems against this background, it can't play
the role it must play based on the principles it upholds and
responsibilities far greater than existed when there was a
Cold War," the king said.
   Without some U.S. action, King Hussein said, he fears that
Israel might spark a war in one of two ways -- by forcing a
mass exit of Palestinians from the West Bank or by some
military adventure in the region. "My concern is that Israel
could act in a way to force an exodus from the territories to
give room for settlers," he said.
   Any exodus of West Bank Palestinians is particularly
frightening to the Jordanian monarch, as they would
inevitably flee next door to his small, poor nation where
already half the population is Palestinian -- mostly refugees
from previous wars. Many in the new Israeli government have
long argued that Jordan is in fact a Palestinian state and
that declaring it to be so is the real solution to the
Arab-Israeli dispute. The king says about 46,000 Palestinians
have crossed to Jordan from the West Bank since the beginning
of the Palestinian uprising, or "intifada", in 1987.
   The other potential flashpoint, he said, would be "a
military adventure" by Israel such as its 1981 destruction of
an Iraqi nuclear reactor. "Israel cannot continue to throw
its weight around without response," he said. "The Arabs have
taken all they can take." In a speech on Baghdad radio in
April, Iraq's president warned: "We will make the fire eat up
half of Israel if it tries to do anything against Iraq. We
are not carrying the banner of challenge. But if anyone
challenges us, he will find us stronger than a diamond. . . .
We will not be trampled upon."
   The king said the U.S. could act to reduce these tensions
by opening its doors to more emigrating Soviet Jews, many of
whom would rather settle in the U.S. than in Israel.
