   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. moved Leo R. Breitman
to a new vice chairman's post and hired D. Bruce Wheeler to
succeed him as president of its main bank unit.
   The changes were the latest in a nearly continuous
management reshuffling this year, since the bank began
dealing with losses and a mountain of bad loans in the
slumping Northeast economy. Mr. Wheeler's hiring as president
of Bank of New England N.A. comes only five months after Mr.
Breitman was moved into the post and bears the imprint of
Lawrence K. Fish, the parent company's chairman and chief
executive officer since March.

   Mr. Wheeler, currently executive vice president of First
Nationwide Bank, of California, said he plans to pursue
opportunities in mortgage lending and in retail banking in an
effort to "get on the offense a little bit" in solving the
bank's problems. Mr. Fish reversed a plan to sell home-equity
loans after taking the reins and also said he wants to
exploit the bank's extensive retail operations in his
recovery plan.
   In his new post, Mr. Breitman will also become senior
credit policy officer. Mr. Wheeler, who managed Massachusetts
banking operations for Bank of Boston from 1982 until 1989,
will be responsible for corporate and retail banking,
commercial real estate and trust and private banking.
   Mr. Wheeler said in an interview that recent thrift
failures and cutbacks in mortgage lending in New England
presented an opportunity for new lending to the bank. He said
a large portion of any new loans generated would be sold into
the secondary market so they wouldn't put pressure on
regulatory capital ratios.
   Bank of New England reported a $1.11 billion loss in last
year's fourth quarter, and a $46 million loss in its first
quarter. It lost about $7 billion in deposits during a run
that followed disclosure of its problems, and is cutting
about a third of its staff, while total assets are down to
$25 billion from a peak of about $30 billion. Further asset
sales are planned.
   Mr. Wheeler said only 2% of the bank's customers have been
lost, suggesting a possibility of rebuilding its commercial
loan portfolio. "There's still a lot of creditworthy
customers in New England," he said.
