   PHILADELPHIA -- Conston Corp., a women's apparel retailer,
said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
federal court here after failing to attract investors or
buyers.
   Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor
lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debt.

   Chairman Charles Conston said management had been looking
"vigorously" for investors or buyers since June 4 and decided
to file for Chapter 11 when those efforts failed.
   The company said it had a net loss of about $10.5 million,
or $1.38 a share, for its year ended March 30 and that sales
have continued to decline in the current year.
   The company said it has arranged for the sale of its
inventory and has hired a specialist to help it recover from
insolvency and return to business.
   The company didn't disclose the amount of its liabilities
or identify its creditors.
