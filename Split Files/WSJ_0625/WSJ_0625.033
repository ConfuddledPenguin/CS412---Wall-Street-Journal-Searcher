   The NBC network, lagging far behind its rivals in the
lucrative daytime television market, is considering an
overhaul of its programming that could include adding a third
hour to the "Today" show.
   National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.,
may also eliminate one of its soap operas and several game
shows in favor of news, talk shows and informational
programming, network officials say.

   While NBC finished the 1989-90 season as the top-rated
network in prime time for the fifth consecutive year, it
hasn't translated that success into daytime programming.
Daytime -- defined as the weekday hours between 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. -- has long been a profit machine for all three major
networks; the shows are less expensive than prime-time series
and the three networks combined pull in about $1 billion in
ad revenue annually from daytime.
   Still, the overall network share of the daytime audience
is shrinking as the traditional audience -- stay-at-home
mothers -- turns to alternatives such as cable network
Lifetime, a joint venture of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Hearst
Corp. and Viacom Inc.
   NBC's slide has been the most precipitous, with its
daytime audience down 12% from a year ago. CBS Inc.'s daytime
audience fell 3%, while ABC's audience decreased 6%. At
present, NBC has about 3.7% of the total audience, compared
with 5.6% for top-rated CBS, which boasts the popular game
show "The Price Is Right" and the No. 1 soap opera, "The
Young and the Restless."
   NBC's 200-plus affiliates, who rely on daytime to promote
prime-time shows and local newscasts, vented their
frustration over the downturn at their annual convention in
Washington recently. "The whole daytime schedule needs to be
rethought," says John Spinola, general manager of WBZ, the
NBC affiliate in Boston.
   John Kueneke, general manager of NBC affiliate KCRA in
Sacramento, Calif., adds: "NBC very much needs to come up
with a long-range plan for daytime. The affiliates would
encourage them to come up with something news and
informational in the morning."
   Virtually none of the programming NBC has thrown on the
screen recently has met with success. "Generations," a new
soap opera with an ensemble black cast, hasn't made a dent in
the ratings despite heavy promotion; network officials say
the show has until the end of the year to prove itself or
face cancellation. "The Marsha Warfield Show," a talk show
starring a cast member from the prime-time hit "Night Court,"
also hovers near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings but,
because it's brand new, the network is more likely to give it
a chance for its audience to grow. The three-year-old
"Classic Concentration" is a dud -- and therefore could be
one of the first shows to go -- as are reruns of the
prime-time series "227."
   And NBC is finding it is harder to woo audiences away from
long-running rival game shows and soap operas. Although NBC
introduced "Santa Barbara" six years ago and fine-tuned it,
the one-hour show remains third in its time period.
   Jacqueline Smith, who was recruited from rival ABC last
year to head NBC's daytime programming, says she was
"disappointed" by the network's performance during her first
year. Although she declined to be specific, Ms. Smith says
NBC is "developing all kinds of programming," including news.
NBC also plans to bring out two new game shows in July and
September -- reprises of the old "Let's Make a Deal" and "To
Tell The Truth."
   Additional late morning news programming is under
consideration because 11 NBC-owned stations and affiliates in
the top 20 markets program their own local newscasts at noon.
Ms. Smith also says that a three-hour "Today" show isn't
"inconceivable," although that is "for some future time.'
   In a recent seven-page memo to NBC News President Michael
Gartner, NBC News Vice President Lloyd Siegel said "a third
hour of `Today' . . . will cost less to produce and will
generate more revenue than existing daytime programs." He
outlined potential programming for a third hour: "Real Life,"
described as continuing coverage of everyday situations of
interest; "Conference Call," women at various NBC affiliates
or foreign NBC News bureaus, reacting to taped stories; and
such features as "Expert Help."
   The memo suggested that a third "Today" hour "be
constructed so that it can run not only at 9 a.m. but at
other hours during the day," to give affiliates flexibility.
   Mr. Siegel couldn't be reached for comment. An NBC News
spokeswoman said any comment on the memo's contents "would be
premature. Lloyd is working on a couple of things. Some might
come to pass, others might not."
