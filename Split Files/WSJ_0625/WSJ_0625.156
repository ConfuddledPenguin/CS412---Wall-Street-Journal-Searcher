   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. -- Central Mortgage Corp. plans to
write off $1.1 million in non-tax-deductible goodwill
associated with the 1987 acquisition of Superior Mortgage
Inc.
   Separately, the bank holding company said it has been
ordered to boost its loan-loss reserves $1.7 million, a move
that will reduce net income for the quarter ending June 30
about $1.5 million.

   Central Mortgage said the Office of Thrift Supervision
ordered the increase in loan-loss reserves following a review
of its Colonial Central Savings Bank. The majority of the
additional reserves considered necessary by the OTS relate to
six construction projects that had been identified as problem
assets.
   Although they agreed to increase reserves, Central Holding
executives said they believe the additional reserves may be
greater than necessary, considering the collateral value of
the properties.
   The goodwill write-off comes in connection with Central
Mortgage's closing of its loan-origination offices in Topeka
and Wichita, Kan. Central Mortgage acquired the offices in
1987. Since this goodwill was already excluded from
regulatory capital, the write-off will not affect regulatory
capital, Central officials said.
