   Reports of the death of the California tax revolt movement
may have been premature.
   Two tax revolt groups in California say they've gathered
enough signatures to put before voters in November a measure
that would require electoral approval of general local tax
increases, while boosting the voter majority needed to raise
taxes under the state's ballot initiative process.

   Under the initiative, dubbed by its sponsors the
"Taxpayers Right to Vote Act," an increase in general local
taxes, currently the prerogative of elected officials, would
require a majority vote of local citizens. The measure would
also raise to two-thirds the percentage of voters required to
pass a statewide tax increase by ballot referendum. Such
increases now require only ratification by a majority of
voters.
   Sponsors, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association and the Paul Gann's Citizens Committee, say their
measure is partly spurred by recent adoption by voters of two
statewide tax measures. One doubled the state's gas tax to
pay for freeway construction while another authorized $1
billion in bond funding to upgrade the state's mass transit
system.
   Passage of the measures, which required only simple
majorities, has been widely hailed as the symbolic end to a
voter antipathy over taxes that began in 1978 by the landmark
passage of Proposition 13 sponsored by the late Mr. Jarvis.
But a spokesman for the Paul Gann's Citizens Committee said
the "Taxpayers Right to Vote Act" would allow voters to
determine for themselves whether the tax revolt is dead. Mr.
Gann, who helped Mr. Jarvis write Proposition 13 and helped
push through other limits on state spending, died last year.
   The act has already garnered the opposition of California
Attorney General John Van de Kamp, Lt. Governor Leo McCarthy
and a number of state legislators. Opponents say such a law
could paralyze state and local governments ability to raise
revenues while interfering with the constitutional authority
of elected officials to decide certain tax matters.
