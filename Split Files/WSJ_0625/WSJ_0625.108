   Commonwealth Mortgage of America LP, Houston, said it
approved a complete plan of liquidation and dissolution.
   The plan was adopted by written consent of Commonwealth
Mortgage Corp. of America, the general partner of
Commonwealth and holder of 59.1% of its Class A units and
100% of its Class B units; and of Commonwealth Federal
Savings Association, the parent of CMCA and holder of 100% of
the Series I preferred units of limited partner interests in
Commonwealth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because of the size of Commonwealth's debt and the
preference in liquidation of the Series I units, Commonwealth
said it was unlikely that holders of Class A units will
receive any distribution.
