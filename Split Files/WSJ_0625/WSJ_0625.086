   NEW YORK -- National Broadcasting Co. said it is willing
to discuss Tele-Communications Inc.'s proposal to use its
cable systems as NBC affiliates in rural areas not served by
broadcast affiliates of NBC.
   But the No. 1 rated network chided the nation's largest
cable company for using the request to gain political
leverage. And privately, NBC executives said there was
virtually no chance of Tele-Communications' proposal moving
forward.

   Tele-Communications President John Malone made the request
last week in a letter to Robert Wright, chief executive of
NBC, a unit of General Electric Co. The request was widely
viewed in the media industry as a ploy by Tele-Communications
to pressure NBC, which is lobbying Congress to ban exclusive
arrangements between cable operators and programmers.
   In its letter, NBC emphasized that any discussions would
include its 200-plus affiliates, which firmly oppose any
network-affiliate partnership with Tele-Communications.
   Tele-Communications said its proposal was aimed at
providing NBC programming combined with local newscasts in
markets where the company has cable systems that currently
have to import NBC affiliate signals from distant cities. For
example, Tele-Communications proposed to launch an NBC
affiliate on its cable system in Olympia, Wash., which
doesn't have a local station, instead relying on Seattle.
   "We're delighted at the prospect of negotiating with NBC,"
Robert Thomson, a Tele-Communications vice president, said
after reviewing NBC's letter, sent Friday. "We thought we'd
get a hell, no."
   While the response wasn't nearly so negative, NBC's Mr.
Wright scolded Mr. Malone in Friday's two-page letter by
writing: "But let's be honest, John. Your representatives
have admitted that you are raising the issue now in an
attempt to draw some . . . parallel between the availability
of NBC programming to non-broadcast distributors, and the
issue being debated in Congress about access to cable program
services by new technologies such as {direct-to-home
satellite TV}. . . . Whatever parallel you are trying to make
doesn't bear scrutiny."
   NBC is interested in dropping exclusivity rights because
it is partners in a direct-to-home satellite TV service,
called Sky Cable, that is scheduled to premiere in late 1993
with 108 channels. Sky Cable needs programming now available
exclusively on cable to ensure survival.
   Mr. Wright wrote that NBC was willing to talk with
Tele-Communications if the cable giant is "really interested
in localism." NBC Cable is partners with Cablevision Systems
Corp. in a 24-hour regional news channel titled News 12 Long
Island.
   In an interview, Thomas Rogers, president of NBC Cable,
said: "NBC has done a lot in regional news. If John Malone is
serious about that, then we could talk. But we've been trying
to get into discussions with TCI for years, and they've never
been supportive of it."
   Mr. Thomson of Tele-Communications said NBC always wanted
to maintain editorial control in local news operations.
   Mr. Rogers dismissed Mr. Thomson's allegations and said,
"If this debate {on program exclusivity} hadn't been going
on, Tele-Communications' letter would never have been sent."
