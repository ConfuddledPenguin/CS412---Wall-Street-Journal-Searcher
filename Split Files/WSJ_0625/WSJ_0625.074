   The sale of a 6.9% stake in Harley-Davidson Inc. by
Malcolm I. Glazer relieves the Milwaukee-based motorcycle
company of what it considered a pesky investor and apparently
leaves the shares in friendlier hands.
   Mr. Glazer wouldn't comment, but there was little doubt
that he was the seller of the block of 1.2 million shares
Friday. Harley's other two big holders said they didn't sell
their shares.

   Harris Associates L.P. said its 9.2% stake held for its
investment clients is unchanged. And the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board said it bought 100,000 of the shares,
boosting its Harley holdings to 9.8%.
   The 1.2 million shares had a total indicated value of
nearly $31 million, based on the $25.625-a-share price
reported by Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc., the
institutional research firm that matched the seller and the
buyers.
   Michael Cleary, president of Milwaukee-based Cleary Gull,
said he considers the purchasers of the shares "friendly" to
Harley. While he wouldn't disclose the identity of the
buyers, he said they were institutional investors.
   Although Mr. Glazer once said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that he might seek control
of the company, Harley and its investment advisers have said
privately that that didn't worry them. They were concerned,
however, that Mr. Glazer's investment could lead others to
bid for the company.
   "He sure made a lot of noises, but I didn't think he stood
much of a chance of making a successful offer," said John
Nelson, investment director of special equities at the
Wisconsin Investment Board, which manages pension money for
public employees.
   Richard F. Teerlink, Harley's chief executive officer, had
called Mr. Glazer's investment "disruptive" and vowed to
fight any takeover attempt. He was out of the country Friday.
   Among other things, Mr. Glazer wanted Harley to sell its
Holiday Rambler unit. But Harley refused to even discuss sale
of the recreational vehicle maker. Harley hopes to turn it
around, much as it did the motorcycle company in the 1980s.
   Harley officials wouldn't comment Friday, but Mr. Glazer's
sale is likely to lead to the end of the company's costly and
time-consuming legal battle with the investor. That started
last year, when Harley accused Mr. Glazer in federal court in
Milwaukee of filing false statements in connection with his
holdings. Mr. Glazer has denied the accusations.
   Although he didn't get Harley to change its ways, Mr.
Glazer walks away with a hefty profit. Harley's stock surged
in recent months as its motorcyle market share, sales and
earnings climbed to record levels. Harley fell 75 cents to
$25.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Friday in a sharply lower overall market.
   Mr. Glazer amassed his shares last year at prices well
below the $25.625 he sold them for Friday. Adjusted for a
2-for-1 split, he paid $15 to $20 a share for purchases in
August and September, for example.
