   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vowed to "leave no stone
unturned" in an intensified federal attack on criminal fraud
in the savings and loan and banking industries.
   Firing back at Democrats who have criticized his
administration's efforts to prosecute white-collar crime, Mr.
Bush told a gathering of hundreds of federal enforcement
officials that the Justice Department will form new
committees and task forces to coordinate S&amp;L investigations
and "throw the crooks in jail."

   The president praised a variety of recent legislative
proposals to help prosecutors go after financial crime,
including one that would allow federal investigators to
request court-ordered wiretaps in bank fraud cases. He
chastized Congress for moving too slowly to appropriate
additional money for criminal investigations of the deeply
troubled S&amp;L industry. And he proposed that Congress
authorize $100 million for such investigations for fiscal
year 1991, a $25 million increase over the amount currently
authorized.
   Congressional Democrats rejected the Bush assault,
pointing out that for fiscal years 1989 and 1990, Mr. Bush
didn't even propose spending the full $75 million that
Congress had authorized for S&amp;L enforcement. Speaking on
behalf of the critics, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said
federal prosecutors have moved slowly in seeking indictments,
creating a huge backlog of unaddressed cases.
