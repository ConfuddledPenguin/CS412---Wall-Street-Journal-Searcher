   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Agriculture Committee, seeking to
avert a nasty floor fight over commodity subsidies,
compromised on a $55 billion farm bill that left neither
Republicans nor Democrats fully satisfied.
   The lawmakers agreed to renew the basic thrust of the
nation's agricultural policies for an additional five years,
while embracing innovative proposals designed to give farmers
a freer hand to plant what they want and a chance to make a
little more money under some circumstances. But budget
pressures, coupled with Republican insistence on freezing
subsidies at current levels, thwarted the Democrats from
protecting farm income from rising production costs to the
extent they wanted.

   For two weeks, partisan bickering had prevented any
progress on the big-ticket commodity programs, with
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the panel's ranking
minority member, threatening to create political havoc on the
floor if Midwestern Democrats forced through higher target
prices and loan rates. The committee was facing the prospect
of 10-9 party-line split until Thursday, when Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) managed to broker a
compromise on the last contentious issues.
   The committee approved the huge package on a 15-4 vote,
with Sens. Thomas Daschle (D., S.D.), Max Baucus (D., Mont.),
Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) and Slade Gorton (R., Wash.)
opposing it. "There's not everything in here that every
member would want," Sen. Leahy said afterwards. But the bill
"makes sense for farmers and consumers and is within the
budget."
   "This bill will avoid a blood bath," said William Lesher,
a Washington-based agricultural consultant, who expects it to
undergo considerable changes on the floor and in conference
with Senate farm lawmakers. The House Agriculture Committee
has finished work on its version of the 1990 farm bill. Floor
action is expected in both chambers by mid-July.
   The legislation would give farmers the option to plant a
variety of crops on 25% of the acreage they customarily
devote to subsidized crops. But in taking advantage of this
flexibility provision, farmers would forgo any subsidies on
that land. The objective is to have farmers make planting
decisions in response to market signals, rather than
incentives created by farm-subsidy programs.
   For all but one commodity, the bill would freeze target
prices and loan rates at the current levels for the next five
years, halting a five-year decline under the expiring 1985
farm law. To spur oat production, the bill would boost the
target price for oats 10 cents a year to $1.85 per bushel by
fiscal 1994.
   The government pays farmers subsidies whenever market
prices for commodities fall short of target prices. The
government also lends money to farmers, who put up their
anticipated crops as collateral. If market prices fall below
so-called loan rates, farmers can forfeit their crops to the
government, instead of paying off the loans. The loan rate,
in effect, acts as a minimum price.
   Under the marketing-loan proposal for wheat, corn and
other feed grains, the lawmakers would give the agriculture
secretary the option of lowering the basic loan rates as much
as 20% to keep U.S. commodities competitive on the world
market. But for each one-cent drop in the loan rate, farmers
would get an advance payment of three-fourths of a cent a
bushel, with the proviso that the advance be repaid. This
wrinkle would reduce the need to borrow farm-operating funds
from banks.
   Some of the innovations embraced by the committee are
likely to be challenged by the Bush administration. One has
been dubbed the "high price bonus." If market prices are
higher than expected, and the government thus doesn't have to
pay out as much as projected in subsidies, the lawmakers
proposed giving farmers two cents out of every 10 cents
saved.
   Another innovation would allow farmers in 15-county areas
in at least four states to participate in a supply-management
experiment. Grain farmers would be required to limit the
number of bushels they sell each year, rather than the number
of acres they cultivate.
   "It doesn't make good economic sense," said Bruce Gardner,
the Agriculture Department's top economist. Some Republican
lawmakers question how the government would enforce such
marketing controls.
