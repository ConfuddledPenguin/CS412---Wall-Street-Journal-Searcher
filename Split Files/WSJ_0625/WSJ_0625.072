   CHICAGO -- Quaker Oats Co., citing "disappointing results"
in its U.S. grocery products business, said it expects "flat
to slightly lower" sales and earnings from continuing
operations for the fiscal year ending Saturday.
   In fiscal 1989, the packaged foods concern earned $2.88 a
share from continuing operations, before a $124.3 million
restructuring charge. Sales were $4.9 billion. Final net
income for the year was $203 million, or $2.56 a share,
including $54.1 million from the company's troubled
Fisher-Price toy division, which Quaker now considers a
discontinued business following the board's decision last
April to spin off the unit to shareholders.

   As reported earlier, Quaker decided to spin off the toy
division to concentrate on other difficulties at the company,
such as sluggish sales in its U.S. and Canadian grocery
products businesses, and increased competition.
   A spokesman said the weak results in its U.S. grocery
products division are due to soft volumes in a number of
major product areas, such as cereals and pet foods.
   As part of an effort to help turn around the company's
fortunes, Quaker said it will reorganize its U.S. grocery
products division, create a separate frozen-foods division
and eliminate between 350 to 400 salaried positions by Jan.
1. Quaker's world-wide employment is about 30,000.
   Quaker also said its 51-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer, William D. Smithburg, will assume the
additional posts of president and chief operating officer,
following the planned retirement of Frank J. Morgan, 64, in
September.
   The company made several management changes under the
reorganization of its U.S. grocery products businesses, all
effective next Sunday. David L. Bere, vice president, Mini
Meals, was named president of the company's Golden Grain
division, succeeding Verinder Syal, who was named to another
post earlier this year.
   Barbara R. Allen, vice president, convenience foods
marketing, was named president of a newly formed frozen-foods
division.
   David J. Anderson, vice president, finance and planning,
was named senior vice president, finance and customer
service, U.S. grocery products.
   Keith L. Robinson, director of ready-to-eat cereals, was
named to the new post of vice president, marketing, hot
cereals; Lyle G. Hubbard, director and general manager of
Lite Snacks, was named vice president, marketing, Aunt Jemina
Mixes and Syrup, Lite Snacks, Corn Goods and Granola Snacks;
and John S. Breuer, vice president, marketing, grocery
specialties, was named vice president, marketing,
ready-to-eat cereals. Margaret Dyer, director, product
management, consumer Gatorade/New Beverages, was named vice
president, marketing, grocery specialties, succeeding Mr.
Breuer.
   Quaker Oats shares closed Friday at $48.25, off 50 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
