   MILAN -- Just as measures have been announced making it
easier for foreign banks to operate in Italy, Britain's
fourth-largest bank, Lloyds Bank PLC, has found its assets in
the country seized in a mysterious legal move that
jeopardizes its business here.
   Lloyds said it is moving swiftly to safeguard its
customers' interests following a private injunction issued by
a Pisa court sequestering as much as $796.2 million of its
assets.

   "We believe the accusation behind the court order is
utterly without foundation. . . . We have lawyers taking the
appropriate action to have it set aside," a Lloyds spokesman
said in London.
   While neither Lloyds nor the Pisa court would give
information on the accusation or who was behind it, sources
close to the case said it related to the seizure by British
police of financial documents in 1987.
   According to Italian and British news reports and banking
sources, the problems apparently stem from an incident in
Manchester, England, in 1987, when a Swiss national, two
Britons and two Italians tried unsuccessfully to cash several
hundred million U.S. dollars of Philippine government
securities at a Lloyds branch. While the link between the two
actions isn't certain, a Lloyds official said the dispute
involves some of the same matters.
   The bank described the move as unprecedented and said the
court order affected all Lloyds transactions in Italy.
