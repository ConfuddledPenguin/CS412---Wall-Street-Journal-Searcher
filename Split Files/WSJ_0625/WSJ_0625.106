   Merrill Lynch said it folded Mr. Ruben's Group Financial
Services unit, which provides retirement-plan and related
services to large companies, into the firm's Business
Financial Services unit, which serves small and midsize
companies. The newly combined Business Financial Services
operation will have annual revenue of about $550 million.
   Senior vice president J. Arthur Urciuoli, 51, remains head
of Business Financial Services.
   Mr. Ruben is a former Merrill human-resources director,
research director and regional sales director who "helped the
firm achieve prominence" in retirement-plan services, Merrill
said.
