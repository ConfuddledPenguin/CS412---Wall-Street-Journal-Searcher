   Turn on your windshield wipers. The cars out there are
flinging mud.
   With 602 car models and a slew of minivans, trucks and
off-road vehicles all vying for a slice of a shrinking U.S.
market, some auto makers are worried that soft advertising
images of winding country roads, sleek women and rustling
pussy willows aren't setting their products apart from the
crowd. So manufacturers increasingly are turning to the
rolling equivalent of a Pepsi challenge: critical
side-by-side comparisons of rivals, boasting that they stack
up better than the next vehicle.

   "It's trench warfare," says Roy Steinwolf, advertising
manager at Saab-Scania of North America, the U.S. sales arm
of Saab-Scania AB, which has been throwing punches at
Mercedes-Benz and Volvo in its latest ad campaign. "We've got
to do what we have to do. If that means coming at the
competitor hard, we will do it."
   "The economic condition of the auto industry" is such that
manufacturers "are becoming more vocal," says Ronald
Smithies, director of the national advertising division of
the Council of Better Business Bureaus in New York.
   And more biting. Subaru of America Inc. pits itself
against Volvo AB, which in turn, claims its 760-series sedan
outclasses Mercedes. Oldsmobile brags its Cutlass Supreme
tops Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus. But perhaps the hottest
head-to-head comparison right now is Chrysler Corp.'s "Meet
the Americans that beat the Hondas" campaign. The ads say
Chrysler's Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim ranked higher
than the Honda Accord in a recent survey of 100 car owners in
California. Chrysler says its Plymouth Sundance and Dodge
Shadow subcompacts outscored the Honda Civic in a similar
survey.
   Despite the millions being spent on hardball advertising,
it's not clear what such tactics accomplish. So far, the
evidence suggests that blasting the competition may produce a
short-term boost in sales, but not necessarily long-term
gains in market share.
   Chrysler's ad campaign hit the airwaves May 20, and during
the last 10 days of May, sales of the touted models rose by
as much as 5% to 27% from a year earlier. But Chrysler
officials say it's too early to tell what impact the strategy
will have on Chrysler's or Honda's market share. John B.
Damoose, Chrysler's vice president of marketing, says it will
be at least two months before Chrysler can even begin to
gauge the effectiveness of the campaign.
   Honda declines to comment on any specific ads. But Kurt
Antonius, a Honda spokesman, says, "Many times we're
flattered" by comparison ads.
   Other companies aren't as sanguine. General Motors Corp.'s
Chevrolet division has been embroiled in a negative
advertising duel with Ford Motor Co. for about 2 1/2 years.
First, Chevrolet ran an ad comparing its pickup trucks to
Ford's by standing them up side-by-side on their front ends.
Ford struck back with a similar ad showing a Chevy sinking
into the ground. Thus began one of the industry's
longest-running -- and nastiest -- advertising battles, as
Ford and Chevy battered each other's full-size and compact
pickup trucks.
   And the results? For the first four months of this year,
Chevy's S-10 share of the pie has dropped to 16.2% from 19% a
year ago. Ford's Ranger has gained during that four month
period to 26.7% of the compact pickup truck segment, up from
22.9% a year ago.
   The biggest casualty of the Chevy-Ford crossfire is
Chrysler's Dodge division, which isn't even mentioned in most
Ford or Chevy ads. Its share of the compact pickup market
dropped to 11.9% at the end of 1989 from 14.1% in 1988.
   Chevy says it may want to continue the fight. "Just stay
tuned," says Richard D. O'Connor, chairman and chief
executive officer of Lintas: Campbell-Ewald Co., Chevrolet's
ad agency. "We'll become even more aggressive with truck
advertising. Whether it will include comparisons, it's hard
to say."
   Ford officials say they want to back away from truck
bashing. "When you name somebody else, you do them more good
than you do yourself," says Ford's president, Philip E.
Benton Jr. "When you look at who's doing this stuff, it's the
people at the weak end of the market. It's usually a
desperation measure."
   Ford apparently isn't ready to take the pledge just yet. A
new ad campaign for Ford's Aerostar minivan takes potshots at
Chevrolet's rival Lumina APV minivan. "This is responding to
a whole batch of Chevy ads," explains John B. Vanderzee,
advertising manager at Ford's Ford division. "If Chevy is
intent on continuing {negative ads}, we will as well."
   Still, many auto marketers agree with Mr. Benton that
comparison advertisements carry the danger of promoting the
competition. And most companies are taking that risk only
when they must position a little-known model against
higher-profile competitors.
   That's what Nissan Motor Co. sought to do for its 1990
Stanza with a recent ad campaign challenging Honda Motor
Co.'s Accord and Toyota's Camry. During a three-month
campaign, Nissan offered to pay $100 to each car buyer who
test drove a redesigned 1990 Stanza but purchased a Honda
Accord or Toyota Camry.
   Nissan says the "bold approach" had a powerful effect:
Stanza sales almost doubled to 29,476 in the first five
months of the year from 15,350 in the year-earlier period.
The substantial rise occurred March through May, when the
television commercials aired. As a result, the campaign,
which had been slated to end June 3, is being extended
through Aug. 2.
   Before the marketing blitz, "the world at large wasn't
sure where the Stanza fit in the marketplace," says John
Rinek, Nissan's national advertising creative manager. Nissan
hadn't aggressively promoted predecessors of the 1990
Stanzas, Mr. Rinek says, and the latest campaign makes the
new Stanza "a much stronger player in the market."
   All well and good, but sales of Accords and Camrys didn't
suffer from Nissan's assault. For the first five months of
the year, Accord sales have risen 15.3% from a year ago;
sales of Toyota Motor Co.'s Camry jumped 27.4% during the
same period. The Camry and Accord both still outsell the
Stanza by substantial margins.
   Strong sales make it easier for the targets of attack ads
to stay above the fray. "If anything, {a comparison ad} tends
to enhance the image of our cars as benchmark automobiles,"
Mr. Antonius, the Honda spokesman.
   That's the same posture West German auto makers Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Mercedes-Benz AG try to take when their
prestigious names are dragged through the mud in competitor's
ads. Mercedes says it refrains from comparative advertising.
BMW usually does, too, although in response to being named in
a number of competitors ads, it came out with the slogan "Why
buy something like a BMW when you can buy a BMW?"
   Still, the competition keeps hammering away. One of the
latest is a Saab campaign, started in May. The struggling
Swedish auto maker boasts that its 9000 model is so much
roomier than a BMW 535i that a sofa could fit in the back
seat. Saab claims the 9000 series also is safer than
Mercedes-Benz or Volvo -- two brands that have built solid
safety reputations in the U.S.
   Saab says it can't yet measure the success of the
campaign, but Mr. Steinwolf, the Saab ad manager, says the
luxury performance market Saab competes in has become so
crowded, particularly with the introduction of Toyota's Lexus
and Nissan's Infiniti, that the Swedish auto maker feels
sometimes it must mention competitors as a way to makes its
product stand out.
   BMW just scoffs at Saab's flailing. "They have a wagon; we
don't," says Carl Flesher, BMW's vice president of marketing.
"But I ask you: When does someone who buys a $40,000 car have
to carry around the sofa?"

   `Upfront' Market Is Up
                                                                                                       

   The "upfront" market, during which advertisers buy network
TV time for next fall, is moving faster than industry
executives had expected, executives said Friday.
   As of late last week, movie studios and auto companies had
mostly finished buying prime-time ad time, while packaged
goods and other companies were in the midst of their buying
spree. Auto makers spent about the same or slightly less than
the $700 million they spent last year, but the movie studio
spending helped boost total sales, the executives said.
   Jerry Dominus, head of sales for CBS, said that after the
unusually powerful upfront market last year, totaling $4.2
billion for the three networks plus Fox, "we expected flat.
But it isn't; it's up."
   Larry Hoffner, head of sales for NBC, characterized the
market as "pretty much as expected. It's moving in a normal,
orderly fashion." ABC executives declined comment, but ad
executives said it had signed up more business than its
competitors so far.
   The networks' decision to abandon standard audience-size
guarantees for a new formula, a decision that riled
advertisers, apparently isn't affecting upfront sales,
network and ad executives both said. "If there are 16 things
that you negotiate, the new policy brings it to 17," Mr.
Dominus said. "But it hasn't been an issue in closing
business."

   Della Femina, Heileman
                                                                                                       

   G. Heileman Brewing, following a review of its ad
agencies, Friday consolidated its beer advertising at Della
Femina, McNamee.
   Eurocom S.A.'s Della Femina had previously been Heileman's
agency only for its small Iron City brand. The shop now picks
up responsibility for Old Style and Special Export,
previously handled at Young & Rubicam; Rainier, which had
been handled at Chiat/Day/Mojo; Colt 45, which had been
handled at W.B. Doner; and other brands.
   Heileman, a La Crosse, Wis., unit of Bond Corp. Holdings,
said the accounts together bill more than $30 million.
According to Leading National Advertisers, however, Heileman
spent only about $15 million advertising its brands last
year.
   "We're obviously delighted," said Louise McNamee,
president of the agency, adding that Heileman's regional
brands will be serviced out of the shop's New York, Los
Angeles and Pittsburgh offices. "We think the brands have
enormous potential and we're ready to go to work."
