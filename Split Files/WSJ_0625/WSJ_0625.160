   The growing market for ceramic casings around electronic
chips has lured yet another entry into a field dominated by
the Japanese and littered with U.S. failures.
   British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit, Carborundum Co., says
it will start shipping samples of ceramic casings by the end
of the year, aiming at "a significant" portion of the $1.5
billion annual market.

   In the next two years, the company says it plans to build
"at least two" full-scale production plants. It also is
trying to forge strategic alliances with major computer and
electronics makers. "We're very aware what we have to face up
to," says Gerald Miller, director of technology and business
development for Carborundum's new microelectronics division.
   Potential customers see Carborundum's entry as
significant. Steve Hansen, a technology manager at Digital
Equipment Corp., says having local suppliers would mean
"getting technology sooner" and having some influence on it.
"The Japanese don't tend to share the latest technology," he
says.
   Ceramics have been gaining wide applications, replacing
plastic casings, but their inherent brittleness makes them
tricky to produce for sophisticated applications. The
difficulties are compounded by exacting standards for
electronic packaging, the casing that both insulates a chip
and connects it to an electronic system through an array of
minute pins.
   The world-wide market is dominated by Japan's Kyocera
Corp., with an estimated 63% share, according to Will
Strauss, president of Forward Concepts Co., a
microelectronics consultant. N.G.K. Spark Plug Co. has 18% of
the market, followed by Narumi Seito Ltd. at 9%, and Shinko
Electric Industries Ltd. at 3%, according to Mr. Strauss. All
told, he says, the Japanese account for 94% of the world-wide
market. "The prospect of an American company knocking the
Japanese is nil," says Mr. Strauss. "I don't think it's going
to happen in this lifetime."
   Neither the pessimism of Mr. Strauss and others nor the
recent experience of Aluminum Co. of America, which is
floundering in the business, has deterred Carborundum from
building a design and engineering facility in Phoenix.
   Alcoa got into the business two years ago, hoping to cash
in on its knowledge of alumina, the powdery intermediate
product in the making of aluminum that is also the basic raw
material for ceramics.
   The aluminum maker has invested more than $70 million in a
San Diego plant to turn that powder into advanced chip
casings. But months into the project, Alcoa replaced some top
managers and technicians at the plant with former
International Business Machine Corp. engineers. "We
recognized that we needed higher skills," says Kenneth
Blevins, president of Alcoa's electronic packaging division.
   Mr. Blevins acknowledges that the plant is behind schedule
in shipment and is still "going through learning curves" as
it tries to reduce product defects. He declines to discuss
Alcoa's specific problems at the plant, but acknowledges that
technology for making ceramic chip casings turned out to be
quite different from the company's expertise in alumina.
   Others before Alcoa had difficulties. Last year, General
Electric Co. sold its ceramics-packaging plant in
Chattanooga, Tenn., to Coors Ceramics Co., a unit of Adolph
Coors Co. GE had acquired the plant from 3M Corp., which in
turn had acquired the facility from American Lava Co. "No one
has been able to make a go of that plant," says Mr. Strauss.
"It will produce one perfect batch, and the next batch will
be out of tolerance and other specifications." He adds, "At
one time, it {the plant} was one big hope for America to
compete against the Japanese."
   Researchers say the technology to form and mold ceramics
into sophisticated products, such as silicon casing, is as
much a "black art" as science. The grain of the powder, the
"binding" solution to hold it all together, the baking
temperature and pressing techniques all influence the final
product. A minute flaw can cause a crack. "It's difficult for
any processing plant to control all this," says Peter
Lagerlof, a specialist on ceramics at Case Western Reserve
University, where Kyocera has endowed a chair for the study
of ceramics. "Even the furnace design affects the product,"
he adds.
   Mr. Lagerlof says that the Japanese, who have been at it
much longer, have managed to achieve that perfect set of
combinations where "they have {fewer} flaws" in the final
product. These process details are "trade secrets," he says.
   In ceramics packaging, a particularly challenging problem
has been controlling the shrinkage rate in the final baking
process. The ceramic must be precisely shaped and patterned
before it's vitrified by heat, which shrinks it. "You find
variation from package to package. When you are dealing with
very fine geometry, the {tendency for ceramics to shrink}
introduces a lot of complications," says Digital's Mr.
Hansen. He adds that as chips get smaller and faster, they
will put even "greater demands" on ceramic casings.
   Carborundum's Mr. Miller says his company will overcome
most of the common problems, drawing upon its "100 years" of
experience in working with ceramic materials. The Niagara
Falls, N.Y., company makes structural ceramics for
refractories, gas-ignition systems and other industrial uses.
   To start with, he says, the company will use aluminum
nitride as the basic material, instead of alumina, which is
the current standard among the Japanese. Mr. Miller said
aluminum nitride has "certain key properties" that
Carborundum will exploit. The material's expansion and
contraction, for instance, matches that of the silicon chip
and dissipates heat better than alumina. Moreover, he says,
the company has developed "a proprietary" knowledge of how to
tweak the sintering and pressing process to "get the precise
combination" of factors to make the perfect piece of ceramic
packaging.
