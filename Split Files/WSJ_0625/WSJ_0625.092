   Lisa Jones, a former trader's assistant at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. who was convicted of perjury last year, was
resentenced to 10 months in prison.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand, prompted
by a recent decision from the Second U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, reduced Ms. Jones's prison term from 18 to 10
months. The judge also cut Ms. Jones's financial penalty from
$50,000 to about $40,000.

   The 27-year old Ms. Jones, a former runaway who made
$100,000 a year at the now collapsed Drexel, sobbed as Judge
Sand announced his decision. Her attorney, Daniel Bookin, had
urged the judge to reduce her punishment to probation. He
expressed his concern that her fragile mental condition would
be further damaged by a stay in prison.
   Mr. Bookin read from a letter his client had sent Judge
Sand in which she described "never-ending sleepness nights
and days filled with anxiety." He also stressed that Ms.
Jones's sentence was unduly harsh in comparison with those of
more powerful players convicted during the government's
crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street.
   Ms. Jones was convicted of five counts of perjury and two
counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a grand jury
looking into allegedly illegal trading involving Drexel. Her
trial drew considerable attention because she had worked for
former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, who was later
convicted along with five partners of now-defunct
Princeton/Newport L.P. for engaging in a scheme with Drexel
aimed at generating bogus tax losses. Her attorney depicted
her as a hapless pawn in the government's sweeping
investigation.
   Mr. Bookin, of the San Francisco law firm Farella Braun &amp;
Martel, appealed the conviction and the original 18-month
sentence on the basis of alleged conflicts of interest by her
trial lawyer who also represented other Drexel employees. The
court upheld the conviction. But it ruled that Judge Sand had
improperly increased Ms. Jones's sentence beyond the level
deemed appropriate under the federal sentencing guidelines.
   The government sought a steep penalty based on the
argument that Ms. Jones's perjury had cost the government
time and money in its effort to prove its case against
Princeton/Newport. The appeals panel, seeing no evidence of
such cost, asked the judge to resentence Ms. Jones.
   At Friday's hearing, prosecutor Neil Cartusciello stressed
that Ms. Jones "could have added very relevant evidence" to
the Princeton/Newport investigation. After her conviction,
according to individuals familiar with the case, the
government urged Ms. Jones to cooperate in their probes, but
she declined. Mr. Cartusciello told the judge that Ms. Jones
"still has information concealed."

   FORMER HOLLY FARMS CEO sues Wachtell Lipton.
   The former president and chief executive officer of Holly
Farms Corp. sued Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, alleging
that an error by the New York law firm cost him and other
employees of the poultry and feed-products concern millions
of dollars.
   In a suit filed earlier this month in Memphis, Tenn.,
Chancery Court, R. Lee Taylor II alleged that Wachtell failed
to "exercise due skill, care and diligence in connection with
rendering advice" to Holly and its former board. Mr. Taylor
has charged that Wachtell made an error in an amendment it
drafted for Holly's stock bonus plan in January 1989.
   The former Holly executive is suing Wachtell on behalf of
himself and some 600 participants in Holly's stock bonus
plan. Mr. Taylor had previously sued Holly in connection with
the alleged error. The litigation is pending.
   Mr. Taylor is seeking a jury trial and unspecified
damages. While the suit doesn't state how much money the
drafting error cost employees, attorneys familiar with the
matter had previously estimated the cost at more than $35
million.
   In recent years, state courts have increasingly ruled that
if lawyers act negligently, they may be liable to third
parties.
   Wachtell declined to comment on the suit. But in a court
filing opposing Mr. Taylor's action against Wachtell, lawyers
representing the New York firm say that Mr. Taylor, in his
capacity as a director and chief executive of Holly, "had
direct responsibility to supervise and control the review and
approval of the stock bonus plan." They say that Wachtell
could also sue Mr. Taylor for contributory negligence in
connection with the plan.
   Mr. Taylor was fired from his job last August, less than
two months after Tyson Foods Inc., another poultry producer,
acquired Holly for about $1.29 billion.
   Tyson's purchase ended eight months of bidding and
litigation with Holly.

   INS LIST bars 340,000 aliens from entering U.S. for
political reasons.
   According to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which
obtained an edited version of the "Lookout" list from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service under a court order,
the number of people listed is far greater than many people
have estimated. The list dates back to 1904, but two-thirds
of the entries were made since 1980.
   "This is the first time we've gotten a sense of the
magnitude," said Arthur Helton an attorney with the
human-rights group. The 370-page document lists the dates
that individuals were added to the list and is broken down by
country. A federal judge previously ruled that for privacy
reasons, the individuals' names couldn't be disclosed. The
committee plans to ask U.S. Judge Leonard Sand in federal
court in Manhattan to order the INS to divulge further
details, such as the individuals' professions.
   The list is mainly used to identify non-Americans who fall
under three sweeping political categories under the 1952
McCarran-Walter Act. Under that law, people can be prohibited
from entering the U.S. if they are considered a threat to the
"public interest," a threat to "national security," or
affiliated with any Communist or totalitarian party. Nearly
all the individuals listed were listed under the third
category.
   In the first three months of this year, 4,399 people were
added to the list, including 401 from China and 3,486 from
Eastern Europe.
   The list includes people from 146 different countries and
other jurisdictions, such as Palestine and Hong Kong. China
accounts for the largest number of entries on the list,
106,777; second is the Soviet Union, 33,064; third is
Yugoslavia, 31,734; fourth is Hungary, 28,450; and fifth is
Poland, 24,608. Mexico ranked 10th, with 5,402, and Japan
ranked 11th with 4,393.
   It is unclear whether some people were listed more than
once over the years, so the exact number of individuals can't
be determined. Often individuals don't learn that they are on
the list until they apply for a visa or until they arrive in
the U.S. A spokesman for the INS couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Mr. Helton said he thinks the committee's findings will
spur legislators to change the law. "I think they will be
stunned by the magnitude of the lookout list and its recent
escalation," he said.

   HBO IS ACCUSED of violating song copyrights.
   In a trial that began this week in Manhattan, Broadcast
Music Inc., a not-for-profit group that represents thousands
of composers, claims that Home Box Office is transmitting
movies and programs that use BMI-licensed songs without
permission.
   BMI has asked U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo to issue an
injunction barring HBO, a Time Warner Inc. subsidiary, from
broadcasting the programming unless it pays licensing fees
for the songs. BMI also asked the judge to rule that it can
require separate licensing agreements from national cable
programmers, such as HBO, and from the programmers' local
cable-system customers.
   HBO maintains that it has an oral agreement with BMI
allowing it to transmit movies using the songs. The company
has also charged that BMI is a monopoly and that the group
has taken steps to make it more difficult for the cable
industry to license its music.
