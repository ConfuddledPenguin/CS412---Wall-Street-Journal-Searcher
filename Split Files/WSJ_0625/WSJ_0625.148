   Now that thrifts are dropping like flies, some of the
bonds they issued also face a shortened life span.
   That's bad news for many small investors who snapped up
mortgage-backed bonds issued by thrifts in the 1980s to enjoy
the unlikely combination of double-digit yields and triple-A
credit ratings.

   A lot of investors aren't even aware that they could be
hurt by a policy adopted in April by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the government's thrift-bailout agency. These
investors may not even know that the mortgage-backed bonds
they hold were issued by savings institutions, let alone that
the thrifts are insolvent and the bonds are callable.
   The RTC has the power to cancel, or "repudiate," bonds and
call them early if a thrift is insolvent. So far, issues from
three thrifts have been "repudiated" and more such moves are
expected, says an RTC spokesman.
   The most recent repudiation -- $391 million of bonds
issued by Merabank Federal Savings Bank of Phoenix, Ariz., --
was made June 8 but hasn't been widely publicized. By
contrast, $3.8 billion of bonds of Franklin Savings
Association in Kansas were repudiated the same day and got a
lot of attention.
   About $8.3 billion of mortgage-backed bonds were issued by
thrifts that now are insolvent. Of this amount, $4.5 billion
in bonds, owned mostly by institutions, have been called. The
rest are mostly in the hands of individuals, says Francis
Parisi, who monitors the performance of mortgage securities
for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Most investors won't lose their money, because the
government will redeem the bonds at face value, or par, plus
accrued interest. They will, however, lose the high yield and
face the inconvenience of finding a new place to invest.
   Investors can't just sell the bonds to some unwary soul.
The RTC policy has already led some institutional owners of
thrift-issued bonds to sell their holdings, driving down
prices in the $20 billion market for thrift-issued
mortgage-backed bonds.
   But bond experts say it might still be worthwhile to dust
off the prospectus or call the broker that sold the bonds to
determine whether prompt action should be taken. About half
the issues that individuals own contain features that enable
investors to sell their bonds back to the trustee. Doing so
could save them the risk of losing months' worth of interest
if the bonds are called.
   Here's what investors should look for:
   -- First, if the original issuer of the mortgage-backed
security is a thrift, ask the broker if the issuing thrift is
insolvent, or could become so. "They might be solvent today,
but the next time they have to report on their tangible net
worth, they might not meet the asset requirements," says Mr.
Parisi. Bonds of insolvent thrifts are more likely to be
called if their yields are substantially above the market
rate; many such bonds now have yields above 10%.
   -- Check to see whether the bond was sold at a premium to
its face value. If it was, investors will lose money if the
bond is called, as the government will redeem only the face
value. "This might be another case when bondholders bite the
bullet," says Byron Klapper, publisher of Fitch Investors
Service, a bond-rating concern in New York. In such cases, he
says, investors should just sit back and enjoy the yield as
long as it lasts.
   -- See if your bond is a so-called collateralized letter
of credit. This name typically applies to the type of bond
held by individuals that might get called by the RTC.
Institutions typically own a different form of
mortgage-backed bonds, securities sold directly by the
thrifts as a way of raising capital. And it was institutions,
which dominate the mortgaged-backed market, that got stung
when the the RTC began the bond-repudiation campaign by
calling $1.3 billion of the bonds of Centrust Bank, a
Florida-based thrift seized in March.
   Next on the RTC's hit list are mostly the collateralized
letter-of-credit bonds held by the little guys. These are
industrial revenue bonds backed with top-quality collateral,
such as Government National Mortgage Association securities.
Collateralized LOCs are owned mostly by individuals, says Mr.
Parisi, because they are regional issues sold by local
underwriters.
   -- If the bond is a collateralized LOC, check to see
whether it has a "put" feature. About half have so-called put
options that enable bondholders to take the bonds back to the
trustee and redeem them at face value plus accrued interest.
Investors can find the name of the bond's trustee, which will
be a major bank, by checking the prospectus.
   Some investors might want to approach the trustee now
because the government hasn't indicated yet whether it would
pay holders of the LOCs interest up to the time the call is
announced, or only up to the date the thrift was taken over.
"Investors risk losing a few months' worth of interest, so
that would be the incentive to get out now -- particularly if
the thrift has one foot in the grave," says Standard &amp; Poor's
Mr. Parisi. This lack of certainty over the payment period of
post-insolvency interest applies only to the collateralized
LOC bonds. The RTC recently issued a policy regarding
mortgage-backed bonds, stating it would pay interest up to
the date of redemption.
   Some bond specialists see other risks. Richard Lehmann,
president of the Bond Investors Association in Miami Lakes,
Fla., and publisher of the Defaulted Bond Newsletter,
believes unscrupulous brokers may take advantage of investor
ignorance and continue to sell these bonds. "Brokers might
buy the bonds at a discount," he says, "and sell them at a
premium to investors who will face a loss of their principal
investment if the bonds are called early."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices finished modestly higher in response to a late
sell-off in the stock market.
   For much of the day, bonds barely budged. But the market
was aroused late in the day when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average plunged 44.55 points in the last half-hour of trading
and closed at 2,857.18. That was the lowest level for the Dow
since the Memorial Day weekend.
   In the afternoon, "There was a pop in bond prices after
the stock market's quick free fall," said Mitchell Held,
chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The benchmark 8 3/4% 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,
or $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The bond was
quoted late at a price of 102 27/32, compared with 102 23/32
Thursday. The benchmark bond's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, eased to 8.47% from 8.49%
Thursday. Shorter-term securities were little changed.
   Tumbling stock prices dragged down junk-bond prices. Most
junk bonds, the high-yield high-risk corporate securities
that have low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all,
closed between 1/4 and 3/8 point lower.
   Hard-hit were junk bonds from cyclical and
recession-sensitive companies, such as Quantum Chemical Corp.
It was recently reported that securities analysts believe
commodity-chemical and plastics companies, a group that
includes Quantum, will see declines in second-quarter
earnings ranging from 30% to 35%.
   Quantum Chemical's 12 1/2% senior subordinated notes,
maturing in 1999, ended down 1 point at 91 1/4.
   In the Treasury market, bond prices fluctuated aimlessly
before the stock market declined. Traders said the market's
lifeless tone reflected confusion over two contradictory
economic reports that provided mixed signals about the
economy's health.
   The durable-goods report for May showed that factory
orders rose a stronger-than-expected 3.9%, a sign of
resurging economic strength. But a report on personal income
and personal-consumption expenditures was weaker than
expected. Personal income rose 0.3% in May and
personal-consumption expenditures were flat, both suggesting
that the economy remains sluggish.
