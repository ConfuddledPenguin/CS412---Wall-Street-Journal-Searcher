   The ministry officials said that Choi asked Paraguay to
present detailed plans for its development projects to
facilitate Korean inter-ministerial considerations. It was
not known how much Paraguay was seeking in loans.
   Mr. Aragana was here with Paraguayan President Andres
Rodriguez who came Wednesday for three days of talks with
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo to discuss ways to
strengthen economic and other relations.
   Mr. Choi told Mr. Aragana that South Korea was studying
the possibility of providing communications equipment and
other supplies requested by the South American country, the
officials said.
