   Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. said it put up for sale
two of its Texas newspapers, the Port Arthur News and its
sister publication, the Orange Leader.
   The closely held newspaper and cable television company
didn't disclose the price it is seeking for the properties,
but said it retained Lee Dirks &amp; Associates, a Birmingham,
Mich.-based newspaper merger and acquisition company, to
assist in the process. Cox said proceeds from the sale would
be used to reduce debt incurred by the 1985 merger of Cox
Communications into Cox Enterprises.
