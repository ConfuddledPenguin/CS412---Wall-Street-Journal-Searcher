   NEW YORK -- More environmental companies are planning
initial stock sales in light of strong investor interest in
the sector and the success of earlier issues.
   With an amended federal Clean Air Act moving through
Congress and public desire to improve and protect the
environment on the upswing, analysts say companies are eager
to take advantage of the positive climate by selling stock.
In addition, there's the perception among many market
analysts that pollution control is one of the few growth
sectors in a sluggish economy.

   "People have a thirst for pure environmental plays," says
David Beckwith, one of two portfolio managers who run the
Freedom Environmental Fund.
   Adds Al Hadhazy, senior analyst for the newsletter, "New
Issues": "All sorts of `green' companies have come to market
this year. The timing is especially fortunate and certainly a
factor in the decision to go public."
   At least two more pollution-control offers are well along
in the IPO pipeline. Environmental Elements Corp. plans to
sell 2.3 million shares at $14 to $16 each, while Horsehead
Resource Development Co. plans about a 3.3 million share
offer at $10 to $12 a share.
   The Horsehead deal is scheduled for this week, while the
Environmental Elements offer is set to come to market by
mid-July, according to a syndicate official at Kidder Peabody
&amp; Co., book-running lead underwriter for both deals.
   Companies need look only at the success of some recent
environmental IPO's to take heart. Sanifill Inc. sold two
million common shares in mid-April at $9.50 each. They are
now trading at 19 3/8. Mid-American Waste Systems Inc. sold
three million shares about a month ago at $24 each. They now
trade at 37 1/2. And Tetra Technologies Inc. sold 2.4 million
shares in April at $10 each. They now are traded at 14.
   Five IPO's for what Securities Data Co. categorizes as
"waste refuse system" companies have come to market so far in
1990 (all since April) for an aggregate $130.6 million. In
all of 1989, five companies in this category went public,
raising $123 million.
   "There are just a few industries that have positive
underlying fundamentals because we're in a slow-growth
economy," says Robert Natale, who tracks new issues for
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Along with pollution-control companies, he cites in this
category high technology, telecommunication, and, until
recently, energy services firms.
   These sectors "have been the beneficiaries of the need to
place cash," and have provided about 80% of this year's
IPO's, says Mr. Natale.
   As for pollution-control stocks, one big question is when
climbing prices will be considered out of line and a
correction set in.
   Analysts are loath to pick a turning point, and many think
upward momentum for clean-up stocks will continue for a
while.
   "Conventional wisdom never goes on forever," says Mr.
Beckwith, of the Freedom Environmental Fund. He says that
already on some days, stock market investors rotate out of
environmental stocks into other sectors.
   The mutual fund's more than $60 million in assets aren't
strictly in U.S. pollution-control stocks, one way to cushion
an eventual downturn in the sector. Mr. Beckwith says 30% of
the fund's investments are in foreign environmental
companies, providing geographic diversity. Also, about 33% of
investments are in what Mr. Beckwith calls companies
providing "superior alternatives" as far as the environment
goes.
   The latter group includes stocks such as those of
alternative energy producers and makers of natural
pesticides.
   The fund maintains about 5% to 10% of its proceeds in
cash, and while Mr. Beckwith frets about a "herd mentality"
and says clean-up stocks tend to trade as a group, he's
bullish on the long-term growth prospects of such companies,
anticipating significant increases in monies spent in the
future to clean up and better preserve the environment.
   Environmental Elements' planned 2.3 million share initial
offer (1.6 million from the company, 700,000 from holders)
represents a 34.5% stake. The company provides large-scale
air pollution-control systems, mainly for electric utilities,
private power generators, the pulp and paper industry and
municipal solid waste incinerators.
   The company was organized in March 1983 for a management
buy-out of the environmental services subsidiary of Koppers
Co. It and its predecessors have been in the air
pollution-control business since 1946.
   The company says in its preliminary prospectus that
"currently proposed amendments to the federal Clean Air Act,
if enacted, will further increase demand for its systems and
technologies by imposing more stringent air pollution-control
standards."
   The company had profit from continuing operations of $1.1
million in the year ended March 31, or 20 cents a share, on
sales of $57.9 million. That compares with a loss of $1.4
million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $46.1 million in
the prior fiscal year.
   Mr. Natale of S&amp;P recommends a "quick flip" for the
Environmental Elements IPO. He says the company's margins
have improved since it discontinued manufacturing operations,
but he questions how much the company can ask for its
services from customers with manufacturing and installation
of systems done by subcontractors.
   Environmental Elements says in its prospectus that it
designs and engineers the air pollution-control systems,
supervises fabrication and installation and provides project
management and quality control.
   On the plus side, Mr. Natale notes the company's backlog
increased 91% to about $103 million in fiscal 1990 after a
74% gain the prior year.
