   MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- Heldor Industries Inc. reported a net
loss of $1.7 million, or 47 cents a share, for the second
quarter ended April 30, as sales declined 30%.
   For the year-earlier period, the maker and distributor of
swimming-pool equipment, spas, jetted tubs and related
chemicals and supplies earned $420,000, or 12 cents a share.

   Sales fell to $20.2 million from $29 million.
   President George S. Zabrycki said sales declined as the
water-recreation industry remained "in the second year of a
down cycle." In addition, he said, Heldor has curtailed sales
of certain low-margin products.
   On the positive side, cost-cutting efforts during the
fiscal first half should trim expenses at a rate of $3.8
million a year, Mr. Zabrycki said.
