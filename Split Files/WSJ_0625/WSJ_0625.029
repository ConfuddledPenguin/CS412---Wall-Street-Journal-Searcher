   DALLAS -- A pension fund representing Dallas policemen and
firemen filed suit in state court here, accusing Travelers
Corp. of breaching a contract for managing real estate
investments by giving preferential treatment to some
investors, including its own employee retirement funds.
   The suit is another aspect of the real estate woes being
faced by large insurers, who are among the U.S.'s biggest
real estate lenders and investors.

   The events leading up to the suit, which seeks $7.9
million in actual damages and $25 million in punitive
damages, were triggered by poor returns on real estate
investments made by the Travelers fund.
   The Dallas retirement plan joined the real estate pool in
1981 but sought to withdraw in 1986 because of its poor
performance. So, apparently, did several other plan
participants, who were informed that under the contract with
Travelers, participants would be paid off on a first-come,
first-served basis. But the Dallas fund still hadn't been
paid by early 1990, when Travelers unilaterally -- and
improperly, the suit contends -- changed the method of
payment to provide for a pro rata distribution.
   Subsequently, says David Everett, an attorney for the
pension fund, it was discovered that Travelers' own employee
retirement funds were also seeking to withdraw from the real
estate pool but were farther back in the waiting list.
   Meanwhile, the suit contends, Travelers was selling off
real estate at far less than the appraised value, leading to
concern that the company wouldn't be able to pay off all plan
participants. "They {Travelers employee retirement plans}
should be the ones out in the cold rather than sharing that
frostbite with us," Mr. Everett contends.
   Travelers, the suit charges, refused requests for a
meeting to discuss the payment change, withheld material
information and charged inflated administrative fees based on
faulty appraisals. Since 1981, the Dallas fund has
contributed $4.6 million to the pooled account; by the end of
1989, the fund's equity share of the account was $6 million.
In that time, the Dallas fund paid $513,000 in fees to
Travelers, the suit says.
