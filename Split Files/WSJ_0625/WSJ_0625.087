   WASHINGTON -- The government's thrift-industry bailout
amounts to an enormous transfer of wealth to a few states
that have the bulk of the U.S.'s sick savings-and-loans, a
fact that is beginning to provoke resentment in states left
to foot the bill.
   The more than $100 billion the U.S. expects to spend to
close failed thrifts and pay off depositors will help prop up
the economies of Texas and several other states. But it means
taxpayers in the Northeast, Midwest and other regions will be
shipping huge sums of money to them without receiving direct
benefits in return.

   "I think there's starting to be a lot of anger," said
Keith Laughlin, staff director of the Northeast-Midwest
Congressional Coalition, a bipartisan group of House members.
"We're hearing this from our members. First, they don't know
why their tax dollars should be doing this, because they
caused so little of the problem."
   Last week, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Ohio) complained on the
House floor that Ohio taxpayers "are being asked to bear too
great a share of the Bush savings-and-loan bailout." Saying
that Ohio was one of 17 states with a thrift industry in the
black last year, Rep. Kaptur declared, "Our citizens are
being asked to pay for collapsing institutions in other parts
of the country."
   Edward Hill, a Cleveland State University economist who
has closely studied the regional economic implications of the
thrift bailout, says that only 13 states -- Texas, New
Mexico, Arkansas, Arizona, Alaska, Kansas, Louisiana,
Nebraska, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Mississippi and Missouri
-- will receive more money than they pay out in the bailout.
The remaining 37 states and the District of Columbia, he
says, will be net losers.
   "The thrift crisis has wide-ranging regional implications,
and the solution will shift wealth between the states and
affect the way in which regional economies develop," Mr. Hill
wrote in a recent article.
   The biggest winner, most analysts agree, will be Texas.
After oil prices crashed in the mid-1980s, the state's real
estate market collapsed, leaving many Texas thrifts stuck
with bad loans. That has left the state's S&amp;Ls with
liabilities exceeding assets by more than $10 billion,
according to Mr. Hill's calculations.
   But if the nation's taxpayers were to write a check today
for their share of cleaning up the S&amp;L mess, based on Mr.
Hill's calculations, Connecticut residents would end up
losing an average of between $949 and $1,237 each, while
funds arriving in Texas would result in a net gain of between
$3,737 and $4,775 for every resident of the state.
   The discrepancy is becoming hard to swallow for some of
the rest of the country. At a Senate hearing last week, Sen.
John Kerry (D., Mass.), said: "Taxpayers are upset there is a
subsidy going to our friends in Texas. Texas pays 7% of
federal taxes but is getting 60% of the bailout." In
Massachusetts, which has had relatively few thrift problems,
residents stand to lose between $785 and $1,026 each in the
bailout, according to Mr. Hill.
   Of course, not all the depositors in Texas thrifts are
Texas residents. Some of the bailout funds coming into the
state could be used to insure depositors from New York, South
Dakota or any state in the union. Mr. Hill acknowledged that
he didn't take brokered deposits into account when he made
his calculations.
   Not all the states with big thrift losses are getting an
easy ride. California, whose thrift industry is more than $2
billion in the red, will pay out between $9.5 billion and $11
billion more than it takes in, Mr. Hill figures. That's the
second largest bill for any state. The net cost per person
comes to between $342 and $397. The reason California comes
out a net loser is that its residents are more affluent, on
average, than much of the rest of the country, so their tax
bills tend to be higher.
   The Bush administration recently raised its estimate of
the cost of the S&amp;L bailout to between $90 billion and $130
billion, not including interest, if the government wrote a
check today. Mr. Hill's estimates range from $159 billion to
$203 billion because he includes the money already spent to
resolve insolvent S&amp;L cases and makes a few other
adjustments.
   To reach his conclusions, Mr. Hill analyzed the
distribution of federal income taxes and deposit-insurance
premiums paid by the states. To measure the flow of bailout
funds into states, he distributed the present value of the
thrift-cleanup costs according to each state's portion of
overall bad thrift assets.
   He concluded that 24 states may end up losing more than $1
billion in the bailout, led by New York, where the net cost
could be between $13.5 billion and $17.3 billion. Incensed by
the costs of the thrift disaster, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
has made criticism of the S&amp;L bailout a regular feature of
his speeches.
   Despite escalating complaints about the inequities of the
bailout, most people agree that the government has no choice
but to honor its commitment to reimburse depositors in failed
thrifts. "We have deposit insurance to spread the risk, and
we spread it," says James Smith, an economist at the
University of North Carolina business school.
   Nevertheless, some lawmakers plan to press the regional
issue. Reps. Kaptur and Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.) are planning
to introduce a bill that would require states with the
greatest state-chartered thrift losses to assume a bigger
share of the bailout bill. The measure was introduced as an
amendment to S&amp;L bailout legislation last year, but it
failed.
   Regional anger over the thrift bailout could affect the
current budget talks between the Bush administration and
Congress too. Mr. Laughlin of the Northeast-Midwest
Coalition, for example, said his group would fight any
proposal for an oil-import fee to raise government revenue.
   "That would be like rewarding the guilty and punishing the
innocent," he said. "It would clearly benefit the
oil-producing states and hurt the oil-consuming states."
   However, the controversy could also give some impetus to
the idea of an increase in the gasoline tax, because that
would hit hardest in states such as Texas.
