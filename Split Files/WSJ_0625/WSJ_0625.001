   Missoula, Mont. -- Montana, as anyone who lives here will
tell you, has four seasons: winter, winter, winter and
houseguests. Having survived temperatures of 80 degrees below
zero, snow as high as the ears on a mule, and months of
daylight as dim as the rays from a 25-watt bulb, we once
again are about to bloom with aunts, uncles and cousins as
well as the usual assortment of acquaintances whose names we
remember about as well as we can recall who shod Gen.
Custer's horse.
   A poll taken by one of Montana's newspapers to determine
the best place to take out-of-state visitors turned up this
answer from one reader: "The best place to take out-of-state
visitors is out of state."

   I'm sure that's not an isolated opinion. We live in a
state whose population is just a few cowhands over 800,000.
In 1988, the annual influx of what the Montana tourism office
calls "nonresident visitors" hit 5.2 million, with most of
them coming and going in July and August, the peak of
houseguest season. More arrived last year and even more are
expected this year. We don't need to be mathematicians to
imagine how many Winnebagos, Holiday Ramblers and other gypsy
vehicles will be on the state's highways and byways this
summer. Or how many times a week we're going to have to
change the linen.
   To make sure I wasn't out on the range all alone with my
impression that most of those millions of visitors are some
sort of kith and kin to those of us already here, I checked
with Sandra Guedes, travel director of Travel Montana, the
state tourism office.
   "In terms of what attracts people to Montana," Ms. Guedes
told me, "scenery is tops, especially the mountains."
   "But," she continued, "friends and relatives are the
single most important reason for attracting people in the
first place."
   Friends and relatives with a spare room.
   In case it sounds as though I'm complaining about all
these visitors, I want to make clear that I am not. I do not
agree that the place to take out-of-state visitors is out of
state. I want them to stay right here where I can keep an eye
on them. For those of us weary of the same old fruited plains
and purple mountains majesties, tourists are the best
attraction around.
   Hardly anything, for example, could be more entertaining
than following a four-door sedan with Iowa license plates
over the precipitous Going to the Sun Highway in Glacier
National Park.
   For vicarious thrills, this form of tourist-watching beats
anything Hitchcock ever concocted. You can almost smell the
terror inside the car ahead as the driver rides the brakes
and the passengers pray that it's possible to survive a fiery
plunge off the face of a mountain.
   (I don't mean to sound too cocky about this sport. I'm a
Hoosier by birth, and when I moved to Montana 20 years ago, I
was terrified of mountain roads. The only difference between
me and a visiting Iowan is that I've gotten used to being
afraid.)
   These vicarious thrills are likely to increase. About half
of Montana's visitors come from Pacific Coast and mountain
states where people are used to the fast lane in high
country. But more and more flatlanders are venturing into
Montana. The director of a program promoting tourism in
Western Montana (the mountainous half of the state) reports
that inquiries from places like Kansas and Nebraska are on
the rise. And Ms. Guedes, of Travel Montana, says she's
seeing "more and more interest on the part of people from the
East Coast and larger cities" -- places where hills are
mistaken for mountains and about the only opportunity to
experience altitude sickness is at the top of the Sears Tower
or the World Trade Center.
   Tourists don't need to be in their cars to be amusing,
however; they're also entertaining face to face. For one
thing, they talk funny. Many of them think the state capital,
Helena, rhymes with marina. They don't know that the accent
falls on the first syllable; I've always figured it falls
that way because Hel is short for Hell, a fact any of the
early miners who named the town's main street Last Chance
Gulch would have testified to if they'd struck it rich enough
to live to tell.
   In a curious sort of way, tourists also are somewhat
musical. Unless they're from Oregon, Alaska, New Hampshire or
Delaware, the only states besides Montana that don't have a
sales tax, they jingle a lot of pennies around with them. The
pennies, something we don't see a lot of here, represent
change from all the oddly priced purchases ($3.97, $15.13,
$208.09) they've made in other states.
   Tourists are interesting in other ways, too. They look at
Old Faithful in Yellowstone Park only through the lens of a
camera, never with the naked eye. They frequently think that
bears, bison and moose are as tame as the stuffed animals in
an F.A.O. Schwarz showroom, and they have been known, all too
often, to try to place a small child on the shoulders of a
live beast for the sake, once again, of viewing an event
through the lens of a camera.
   A few of them also have fascinatingly inflexible tastes in
food and drink.
   For a treat almost equal that of following flatlanders
over Going to the Sun Highway, a friend of mine likes to
offer out-of-staters, especially those from places with
subway systems, burgundy from a bottle that's been in her
refrigerator a few days. Then she waits for the look on their
faces. Or better yet, if one of the visitors is a writer
disguised as a tourist, which sometimes happens, she waits
for an article, sure to show up somewhere, that discusses not
only the quaint temperature at which Montanans serve red
wine, but also the ubiquity of bolo ties and belt buckles
carved from elk antlers.
   Only one thing worries me about the fun of
tourist-watching in Montana. It's bound to wear off.
According to Ms. Guedes of the state tourism office, "80% of
the people who visit Montana come back." That means that even
if Ms. Guedes's office manages to double or triple the number
of tourists in Montana (which is something some folks in the
state think is a good idea), eventually I'm going to be
seeing the same old faces year after year. And that means I
might as well go back to enjoying the deer and the antelope,
which, come to think of it, won't be so bad after all.
   I've never known one yet to expect fresh towels every day.
