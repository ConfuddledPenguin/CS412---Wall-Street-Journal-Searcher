   HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines said it cut fares for
travel around the July 4 holiday by as much as 51%.
   The reductions vary by market, but the airline said the
maximum round-trip fare in the promotion is $238. That fare
applies to the New York-Los Angeles route, down from $426.
Other reduced fares include $158 on the Denver-Chicago route,
down from $280, and $158 on the Houston-Miami route, down
from $324.

   Other airlines matched a similar promotion last year by
Continental, a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
and are expected to do so again this year.
   Continental said the lower fares are available on
"hundreds of thousands" of seats. It wasn't more specific.
   The reduced fares apply to travel that begins between July
1 and July 7 and returns July 4 or later. The carrier said
tickets must be purchased by Thursday and aren't refundable.
