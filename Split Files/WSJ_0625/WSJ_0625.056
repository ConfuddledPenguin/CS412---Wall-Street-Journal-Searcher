offering of 1,250,000 common shares at $10 apiece, but in

   Of the total, Photronics sold 1,050,000 shares and
shareholders 200,000. Photronics will use its proceeds from
the offering to cut debt and general purposes, said Senior
Vice President Michael J. Yomazzo. Photronics now has nearly
4.4 million shares outstanding. Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding, a group within Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., led
the underwriters.
   Photomasks are high-precision glass or quartz plates used
to transfer circuit designs onto computer chips.
   The selling shareholders were three Photronics executives:
Constantine S. Macricostas, chairman, president and chief
executive officer, who sold 90,000 shares, leaving him with
44.1%; Mr. Yomazzo, 50,000 shares, leaving 5.9%; and Vincent
Santoro, 10,000 shares, leaving less than 1%.
   Also selling 25,000 shares apiece were two trusts for Mr.
Macricostas's children, leaving each trust with 3.7%.
