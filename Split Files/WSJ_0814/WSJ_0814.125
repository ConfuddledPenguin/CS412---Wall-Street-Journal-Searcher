   THE WHITE HOUSE SAID its naval barricade of Iraqi ships is
taking hold.
   As the U.S. ordered a fourth aircraft carrier to the
Mideast, Britain and Australia said they will help the U.S.
interdict Baghdad's shipping, but France said it wouldn't
join the embargo. Included in the U.S. naval cutoff are food
shipments bound for Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, an Iraqi tanker
tried to dock at a terminal to take on oil, but was turned
away. Pakistan voted to send troops to defend Saudia Arabia,
joining ground forces from the U.S., Egypt, Morocco and
Syria. The State Department said at least 500 Americans
slipped out of occupied Kuwait despite Iraq's refusal to let
non-diplomats leave. The U.S. estimates 2,500 of its citizens
are in Kuwait, and 500 to 600 in Iraq.
