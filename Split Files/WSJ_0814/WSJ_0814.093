   TOKYO -- Sony Corp.'s U.S. unit will set up an engineering
group to develop the next generation of the Unix operating
system, widely used in engineering workstations, a company
spokesman said.
   A group of about 30 engineers will be set up within Sony
Corp. of America in October to produce a more advanced
version of the Unix operating system, the spokesman said.
Aside from about four engineers sent from Japan, the staff
will consist almost entirely of local engineers experienced
in working with Unix, the spokesman for the electronics
concern said.

   Sony will be one of the first Japanese companies to
develop Unix software applications in the U.S., allowing the
company to take advantage of advanced U.S. software
technology and expertise, the spokesman said.
   "Workstations is the area in which competition is the most
intense and the pace of developing new products is the
fastest in the computer-related industry," he said.
   Establishment of the software developing group in the U.S.
will allow Sony to keep pace with technological developments,
he said.
   Computer software-related operations in the U.S. by other
Japanese companies center on converting U.S.-made application
software so that it can be loaded onto their own computers,
the spokesman said.
