   ROCKVILLE, Md. -- W. Bell &amp; Co. said it received a
potential offer valued at $8.6 million to $10.5 million from
Hong Kong-based Venture Link Co. Ltd. The company said
Venture Link expects to submit a bid for all of W. Bell's 3.8
million shares outstanding based on the estimated book value
at closing. W. Bell said Venture Link estimates book value
will range from $2.25 to $2.75 a share by the Oct. 31 closing
date. The catalog showroom retailer said the offer is subject
to due diligence by Venture Link, acceptance by W. Bell
shareholders and financing. W. Bell said its board expects to
respond shortly to the potential offer.
   W. Bell also said it expects to report a "significant"
operating loss for the second quarter ended Aug. 4, following
a first-quarter loss of $1.1 million, or 30 cents a share. In
the 1989 second quarter, W. Bell posted a loss of $946,000,
or 31 cents a share.
