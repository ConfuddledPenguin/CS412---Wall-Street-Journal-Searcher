   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Orders for semiconductors in the U.S.
market ran 3.5% higher in July than a year ago, the
Semiconductor Industry Association said.
   However the microchip industry's sensitive book-to-bill
ratio -- an index of sales health -- has contracted from the
levels of the preceding two months, in keeping with the
industry's seasonal summer doldrums.

   Average monthly order bookings for July based on a
three-month moving average were $1.189 billion, up from
$1.148 billion in the year-earlier period.
   However, the trade group said July orders were down 6.4%
from the $1.270 billion figure posted in June 1990, and they
decreased 12.8% from the April level of $1.363 billion.
   Semiconductor shipments, or billings, in July were $1.079
billion, down 6.4% from the $1.153 billion level of July
1989, and down 16.7% from the $1.296 billion level in June
1990.
   Comparison of the three-month averages of both new order
bookings and order shipments resulted in a book-to-bill ratio
of 1.00, up from the year-earlier ratio of 0.92. A ratio of
one indicates new orders and shipments are in balance. A
ratio above one indicates sales are expanding, while a ratio
below one indicates new sales are contracting below the level
of shipments.
   The July book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 is the lowest since
last November, when the ratio was 0.95.
   "It's not outstanding news," an SIA spokesman said. "But
it is consistent with the industry's usual summer dip and
with earlier predictions for flat to slightly negative
growth" for the balance of 1990.
