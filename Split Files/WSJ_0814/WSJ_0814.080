   CALGARY, Alberta -- Archer Communications Inc. and
PolyGram NV signed a licensing pact under which PolyGram
plans to use a computerized sound mixing process developed by
Archer, the companies said.
   Under terms of the nonexclusive five-year accord, the
Dutch music company will pay Archer a royalty of 1% of total
net retail sales of all PolyGram recordings that use Archer's
sound technology, known as QSound.

   Neither company would forecast the potential value of the
agreement, though PolyGram said it plans to release at least
20 recordings featuring QSound during the next 18 months.
   A PolyGram spokeswoman wouldn't say which of the company's
stable of rock bands and other popular musicians would be the
first to use QSound, but she said the first of the recordings
could be out by Christmas. PolyGram's best-known artists
include Sting, Bon Jovi, U2, and Def Leppard.
   Earlier this year, Archer reached a pact with Japan's
Nintendo Co. to use QSound in home video games. It is also
negotiating licensing agreements with other music and video
recording companies, an Archer executive said.
   Archer's accord with PolyGram includes an option under
which PolyGram can acquire as much as 15% of Archer's common
shares, at $17.50 each, or a total of about $37 million,
during the next two years.
