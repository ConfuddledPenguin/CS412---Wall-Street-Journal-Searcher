   MOSCOW -- The day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Soviet
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda ran the story under the
critical headline: "The armor is strong and the tanks are
ours."
   Unlike other official Soviet press accounts of the Iraqi
invasion, which largely reiterated Kremlin condemnation of
the action, the youth daily used the occasion to take a swipe
at long-standing Soviet policy in the Middle East. "We can
only regret that the main military might of this army
consists of military technology delivered to Iraq by the
U.S.S.R. for years," it wrote.

   Glasnost is finally catching up with Soviet foreign
policy. For three years now, newspapers and television have
made use of the new spirit of openness introduced by Mikhail
Gorbachev to run ever bolder reports about the dismal state
of life inside the country. But their commentary on foreign
affairs has been tamer.
   Since revolution swept away the Soviet-backed regimes of
Eastern Europe last fall, however, that has started to
change. Life in the capitalist West, once depicted as the
land of the homeless, the unemployed and peace demonstrators
brutally dispersed by truncheon-wielding police, has now been
idealized almost beyond recognition. More cautiously, the
policies of dictators who remain Soviet allies are coming in
for tough criticism.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, which has a circulation of almost 22
million, has been leading the pack, especially with its
needling of Cuba and North Korea. The needling has drawn
angry responses.
   In March, the paper ran a highly critical two-part series
of life in North Korea. It opened with the phrase, "Time's up
for the Korean revolution and its leader," and proceeded to
draw parallels between Kim Il-Sung's regime and that of
former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The North Korean
ministry of information summoned the reporter to express its
displeasure, and editors in Moscow received threatening phone
calls from North Korean students.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda's Havana correspondent has had it
harder. One story ran down the list of problems faced by
Russian brides settling in Cuba. High on the list was a
rationing system that gives them only two pounds of potatoes
a month. For potato-loving Russians, that one fact was a
stinging indictment of the Cuban regime. Not long after the
article ran, the reporter was involved in a car accident in
Cuba under "mysterious circumstances," says Maxim Chikin,
Komsomolskaya Pravda's 28-year-old foreign editor.
   But such articles remain the exception. Editors admit that
foreign policy remains a touchy subject and almost no foreign
correspondents have experience challenging the government.
   Yassen Zasursky, dean of Moscow University's journalism
school, says no official paper has yet openly criticized the
thrust of Mr. Gorbachev's foreign policy, and other sniping
has been rare, until recently.
   Before the Iraqi invasion, when the Western press was
already calling President Saddam Hussein "the butcher of
Baghdad," the Soviet media paid little attention to him. One
exception was a May article in the weekly Argumenty i Fakty
that blasted Saddam Hussein for committing atrocities against
Kurds and communists inside Iraq, and blamed past Soviet
leaders -- not Mr. Gorbachev -- for selling him arms.
   Other Soviet publications picked up these attacks only
after the invasion, once the Kremlin cut off arms sales to
Iraq. Four days after Iraq's invasion, the radical youth
weekly Sobesednik likened it to the Soviet invasions of
Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. "Why did our
country arm this monster (Saddam Hussein) with super-modern
arms and maintain a treaty of friendship and cooperation with
such a regime?" the paper asked.
   The latest issue of Moscow News, another outspoken weekly,
urges the Kremlin to assume some responsibility for resolving
the crisis. The Soviet leadership, it wrote, "was well
informed about the rivers of blood that drowned the country
during the cruel campaign of destruction against the Kurdish
minority and the Iraqi Communist Party, but preferred shamed
silence, delivering Iraq various weapons in return for no
small amount of money."
   Most of the press hasn't been so brave. But in one area,
the depiction of life in the West, almost all papers have
thrown caution to the wind.
   A new TV show in Leningrad called "Ordinary Capitalism,"
recently took its viewers on a trip through the wonderland of
Austria. After lovingly showing supermarket shelves groaning
with goods most Soviets can only dream of buying, the show
managed to find a rare fault: a taxi that the TV crew called
from their Austrian friend's mobile phone was 25 seconds
late.
   With the Communist Party discredited, the U.S. government
is sometimes depicted as a model for Soviet reform. One
recent report on Soviet TV took a look at U.S. agriculture.
The new view of the U.S. has already convinced most Soviet
viewers that everything in America works perfectly. So it
came as quite a shock to viewers used to blaming bureaucrats
for everything from cigarette shortages to sour milk that a
mere 10,000 bureaucrats administered the U.S. farm system.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter created a sensation
when he explained that the government machine tries to help
farmers. Boris Kalyagin, Soviet TV's Washington
correspondent, says the notion that a government could help,
rather than hinder, was mind-boggling for viewers.
   Some think all this goes too far. Erik Alekseyev, 64, the
foreign editor at Trud, the national labor-union paper,
grumbles about "a wave of ecstasy" in reporting Western
affairs.
   Adjusting to new times can be particularly hard for the
old guard of Soviet journalists such as Gennady Vasilyev. A
sprightly 64-year-old, Mr. Vasilyev long served as one of the
best-known and fiercest anti-Western propagandists. He
started his career with the Soviet news agency Tass under
Stalin in 1949, and has spent the past 25 years at Pravda,
the Communist Party daily.
   He admits, his job was to show the evils of capitalism.
"It was once very simple, I remember it well," Mr. Vasilyev
says. In the old days, "our task was seen as explaining what
was decided somewhere at the top."
   As late as 1987, Mr. Vasilyev still denounced American
"extreme rightist circles, who are betting on inflaming
hatred toward the peoples of socialist countries, working up
American chauvinism and intensifying the nuclear arms race."
   Mr. Vasilyev now sings a different tune. In late July, for
example, he wrote a commentary on President Bush's speech,
made at the launching of a new aircraft carrier, about the
need to keep a strong military. The stock cliches about U.S.
imperialism are nowhere to be found. The tone was apologetic,
calling for understanding of Mr. Bush's need to look tough on
the eve of this fall's election campaign.
   He now says he regrets his past. "I feel sorry for myself
that my best years, the ones I spent in America, in England,
were so unproductively used," he laments.
