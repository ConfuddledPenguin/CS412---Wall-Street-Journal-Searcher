   Tucson Electric Power Co., the Arizona utility battered by
a stream of misdirected investments, said it posted a
second-quarter loss of $72.6 million, or $2.94 a share.
   The loss includes a $5.4 million loss from discontinued
operations and a $52.6 million provision for a loss on the
disposal of discontinued operations. In the year-earlier
quarter, the company reported net income of $20.9 million, or
76 cents a share, after a loss from discontinued operations
of $905,000. Revenue declined 7.3% to $124.1 million from
last year's $133.8 million.

   Tucson Electric, Arizona's second-largest electric
utility, has been hurt by its investments in real estate and
financial services, and has grappled with an apparent excess
construction of generating capacity. The company said it
recently adopted a formal plan to liquidate its investment
subsidiaries by 1994. It also said it expected the debt of
the investment operations to be repaid by Dec. 31, 1990.
"This is an important step in the process of becoming a pure
utility again," said Charles E. Bayless, president and chief
executive officer.
   But Tucson Electric also said that its utility operations
continue to operate at a net loss.
   "The real question is: Can they lift income from utility
operations? This is problematic," said Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette utility bond analyst Daniel Scotto. Because of the
utility's excess capacity, and past efforts to cut costs, the
company's future viability hinges heavily on rate relief from
Arizona public utility authorities. "The prospects of that
are questionable," Mr. Scotto said.
   Last January, Tucson Electric voted to eliminate its
quarterly dividend on common stock, based on the board's
evaluation of the company's then lack of earnings and
inadequate cash flow. It was the first quarter since the
Arizona company became publicly traded in 1946 that a
dividend hasn't been paid. In February, the company announced
that a previously negotiated $760 million sale-lease-back of
a power plant had collapsed, and analysts said that put
substantial new pressures on Tucson Electric.
   Three months ago, Tucson Electric raised the possibility
that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection
from its creditors if various financing plans aren't
successful; it has since announced the placement of $96
million of first-mortgage bonds in a major step toward its
financial restructuring.
   For the six months ended June 30, the company reported a
net loss of $87.4 million, or $3.62 a share, which included a
loss from discontinued operations of $7.4 million and a
provision for a loss on disposal of discontinued operations
of $52.6 million. In the year-ago period, the company
reported net income of $41.4 million, or $1.51 a share, after
a loss from discontinued operations of $9.6 million. Revenue
for the six months was $233.1 million, a 10% drop from the
$259.7 million it reported a year ago.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Tucson Electric stock closed unchanged at $11.375 a share.
