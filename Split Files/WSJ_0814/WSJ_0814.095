   BURBANK, Calif. -- The first public investment by Roy E.
Disney's new "white squire" fund appears to have hit a snag,
as the group postponed reaching a definitive agreement to
acquire a controlling stake in Child World Inc., the nation's
second largest toy retailer.
   The fund, Trefoil Capital Investors L.P., said it extended
until Aug. 24 the deadline for the agreement to acquire an
82% stake in Child World held by Cleveland-based CNC Holding
Corp. An agreement was supposed to have been concluded by
last Friday.

   Trefoil said only that the companies "have agreed to
mutually explore . . . the possible resolution of outstanding
issues relating to this proposed acquisition," and that
"there is no assurance that the parties will reach final
agreement."
   Exact terms of the proposed transaction haven't been
disclosed, although Trefoil has said it would follow up the
purchase with a $14-a-share, or $28 million, cash offer for
the 18% of Avon, Mass.-based Child World now in public hands.
   Trefoil is a $450 million investment fund formed by Mr.
Disney and principals of his Shamrock Holdings Inc.
investment concern. The fund is designed to invest in
companies burdened by heavy debt.
