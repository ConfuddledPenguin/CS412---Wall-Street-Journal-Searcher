   General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union
reached a tentative settlement late yesterday of a strike at
a parts plant at Flint, Mich., that has given the auto maker
a costly demonstration of the depth of its labor troubles.
   GM didn't disclose details of the settlement. Work could
resume at the Flint plant as soon as tomorrow, a GM spokesman
said. However, that may not be soon enough to prevent further
assembly plant shutdowns. It could take several days to
restock the supplies of gas tanks and other parts made at the
Flint factory.

   The Flint walkout, which began last Wednesday, was
ostensibly over local grievances. But union officials and
workers at the AC Rochester division plant said the strike's
real purpose was to show the UAW's determination to win broad
job protection for all 300,000 UAW-represented workers at GM.
The UAW and GM are currently bargaining for a new national
contract. The old pact expires Sept. 14.
   "We want job security," said 46-year-old Roger Wagner, who
has worked at the plant since 1964. "You wouldn't want to
work for a place for 26 years and then have them close the
place down."
   Mr. Wagner, who was at the local union hall to sign up for
strike benefits, said that when he went to work at the plant,
he had more than 12,000 co-workers. Now, there are only 2,400
people who actually work at the plant. Another 800 counted as
full-time workers are actually laid off, but are paid full
wages and benefits because GM gave their work to outside
contractors. GM has said another 600 of Mr. Wagner's
co-workers could lose their jobs in 1992.
   By taking the unusual step of sanctioning a local strike
during national talks, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich,
head of the union's GM department, has sent a clear signal to
GM, and restive rank-and-file members, that he is willing to
put the fight for job security ahead of labor-management
cooperation. Mr. Yokich also has served notice that he is
ready to hobble GM with carefully targeted strikes if the
company won't bend on job security issues.
   The AC Rochester plant is a critical operation for GM
because it is the sole supplier of gas tanks for 55% of the
auto maker's U.S.-built cars, vans and trucks. By striking
this single factory, the UAW forced GM to shut other
operations employing about 11,550 people.
   Last week, GM shut all or part of truck plants at Moraine,
Ohio; Shreveport, La., and Pontiac, Mich. Yesterday, GM had
to stop the line at its Buick City plant in Flint, idling
3,300 workers who build GM's successful Buick LeSabre and its
sister car, the Olds 88 Royale. The Buick has the highest
quality rating of any car built by the Big Three U.S. auto
makers, according to a survey by J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a
California market research firm. Part of a truck plant in
Flint also shut down.
   In the wake of the strike, production could be halted
today at GM's assembly plant in Orion Township, Mich., which
builds the Cadillac DeVille and the Oldsmobile 98, a GM
spokeswoman said.
   The walkout could hurt GM's profit for the third quarter.
The company had planned a sharp boost in vehicle production
for the current quarter. "It's too early to tell whether we
can make up the losses," the GM spokesman said.
   Striking workers said a profit squeeze is exactly what
they wanted. "It's the only way you're going to get
management's attention," said striker Owen Jackson, who has
worked for GM in Flint for 40 years. "The only time we've
gotten anything here is when we put our foot down and let
them know where we stand."
