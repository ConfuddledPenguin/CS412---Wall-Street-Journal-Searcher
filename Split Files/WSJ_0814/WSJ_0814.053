   Iraq, in response to the tightening world embargo, has
slashed oil output to its own consumption needs plus a
trickle of exports.
   Leading monitors of production by the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries estimated Iraqi
output has dropped as low as 600,000 barrels a day. That's
barely one-sixth of the 3.5 million barrels the country was
pushing out during a brief surge just before the last OPEC
meeting in late July.

   Current output is covering Iraq's domestic needs, with a
little margin to support the tiny flow of exports "leaking"
through the near-blockade of the country. The refusal of
major oil-buying nations to trade with Iraq means oil tankers
aren't showing up at the usual Middle East ports to pick up
oil as they normally would. Storage facilities have become
choked, leaving Iraq no choice but to cut the flow from its
wells.
   Only a small amount of oil now is leaving Iraq, mainly in
trucks crossing into Jordan. The final destination isn't
known.
   For a while, world oil supplies are expected to remain
plentiful because of indicated production increases elsewhere
and high inventories, including a large number of cargoes of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude still at sea. But the reduction in
Iraq production suggests an eventual tightening of world oil
supplies unless the lost Iraqi oil is replaced by others in
OPEC.
   Oil prices rose again yesterday on reports that Iraq's
pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea has now been
closed and that an Iraqi tanker was turned away from the
Saudi terminal of Al-Muajjiz, even though those events had
been expected. These developments followed last week's
closings of two Iraqi pipelines across Turkey to the
Mediterranean.
   On European spot markets, North Sea crudes were priced 35
cents to 55 cents a barrel higher. In the U.S. futures
market, September crude also was up 54 cents, to $26.77 a
barrel, when trading was suspended because of a power outage
in lower Manhattan.
   In Kuwait, occupied by Iraqi troops since Aug. 2,
production is said to be near zero. This means that the
losses to world oil markets from the combined reductions in
Iraqi and Kuwaiti output now total some 4.3 million barrels a
day.
   Total OPEC production is down even more -- some 4.4
million barrels a day -- from the July average. That's
because some countries such as the United Arab Emirates
reduced their output for August in line with the terms of the
late-July OPEC agreement.
   But there are signs that overall OPEC production is
beginning to recover some from the lows of recent days,
according to Petro-Logistics Ltd., which monitors OPEC output
on a weekly basis. Conrad Gerber, president of the
Geneva-based firm, predicted that output in the third week of
August will expand to around 21.5 million barrels a day.
Total production has dropped to 19 million barrels a day in
the second week of August, after averaging 21 million barrels
a day in the first week of the month. As a result, he said,
"I would expect the August average to be about 21 million
barrels a day."
   That isn't enough to meet anticipated demand of 23 million
barrels a day for OPEC oil for the remainder of the year. "It
looks like we are not able to replace the {embargoed} crude
in full unless there is more export leakage out of Kuwait and
Iraq than we had assumed," said William Edwards, a Houston
energy consultant.
   The gap could be filled for a while from "surge" capacity,
estimated at some 4.2 million to 5.3 million barrels a day by
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. The publication defines such
capacity as extra output available around the world from
existing fields for as long as 30 days.
   There isn't much spare capacity outside OPEC that could
sustain additional production over several months. Within
OPEC, some countries, such as Venezuela, already are
producing more. Beyond that, an estimated additional 3.5
million barrels a day of spare capacity remains that could be
utilized on a sustained basis. Most of it is in Saudi Arabia.
The Saudis have indicated a willingness to increase
production if necessary to maintain stability in oil markets.
   Overall, with Iraq and occupied Kuwait excluded, OPEC
could produce close to its second-half production ceiling of
22.5 million barrels a day if the 11 other members went all
out.
   Yesterday, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Prince Bandar
Bin Sultan, told a Washington news conference that OPEC will
hold a meeting soon to discuss ways of stabilizing the oil
market. "In that meeting, I hope we can come up with good
news," Prince Bandar said, adding: "But my country is
championing stabilizing the situation in the oil market."
   A senior member of an OPEC delegation from another
oil-exporting country said yesterday that consultations are
continuing among the oil ministers regarding a possible
emergency meeting. But he said it is uncertain for the time
being because of difficulty in determining Kuwait's
representatives.
   Separately, in the U.S., retail gasoline prices fell
nearly 3.5 cents a gallon over the weekend, to a national
average of $1.216 a gallon, the American Automobile
Association said. After a run-up of 15 cents to 20 cents
across the country, pump prices nationally began to edge
lower last Friday. Changes are regional, however, and some
prices rose.
