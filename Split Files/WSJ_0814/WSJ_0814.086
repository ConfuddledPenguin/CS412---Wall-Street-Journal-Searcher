   There are genres that have little to fear from history.
Agatha Christie can lie easy knowing that Miss Marple's
insights into greed and pride and lust in the arcadian
village of St. Mary Mead are timelessly valid; today's Sue
Grafton can place her famous private eye Kinsey Millhone into
a similarly mythical southern California; Dick Francis knows
equine DNA is steadfast.
   But it is otherwise with the spy novel. Born in the
tormented '30s and ripened in the fearful '50s and '60s, the
international thriller now seems on the ropes. History is
punching too fast, and the fighters on the card are not in
their prime. Even ex-champ Le Carre seems reduced, in 1988s
"Russia House," to empty epigrams and sour self-loathing.
Only Tom Clancy is holding on to his title.

   Two recent examples are variously depressing. Robin
Hunter's "The London Connection" (Morrow, 239 pages, $18.95)
is a dim epigone of the James Bond school. It is the third
novel starring Simon Quarry, "a reclusive British publisher,"
who functions on the sly as an ace government hit man. In
semi-retirement, he wishes nothing more than to live with his
Italian mistress on Majorca. Despite pleas to stop the
Medellin cartel from taking over the Caribbean Commonwealth
island of Cay Dorado, he refuses until the "narcotraficantes"
unwisely boff his pal. Then it gets personal.
   Author Robin Hunter, one is not surprised to read, is "the
pseudonym of a retired British publishing executive." Rife
with these naive fantasy projections, outdated Britocentric
assumptions and dead language, the book shows the Fleming
formulas (fun for five minutes in their heyday) turned flat
and fizzless.
   Another thriller variant sketches skulduggery in the White
House foiled by courageous investigative reporters -- a
"liberal" daydream in contrast with the "conservative" Bond
stuff. William Nixon's "Strategic Compromise" (Birch Lane,
416 pages, $19.95) tries to refry recent scandals into a
fresh burrito. Waspy U.S. Prez Delbert Satterfield, George
Bush's successor, has, under the prodding of
Edward-Teller-like scientist Rubin Steinbrenner, secretly
deployed Star Wars, spending billions behind Congress's back.
Hotshot Washington Post reporter Malibu Hamilton (yes,
Malibu) is poised to leak the sizzling dope to liberal Sen.
Ashworth, who cackles, "We're going to make Watergate and the
Iran-Contra scandal look like damned games."
   But a KGB mole on Ashworth's staff and the arrival in D.C.
of crack terrorist Sergio complicate matters and pose
harrowing moral dilemmas for Malibu. Here too History has
trumped a dumb plot, whose central conspiracy (predicated on
an aggressive U.S.S.R.) is technically impossible, weakly
motivated and dully explicated. Besides, the next big scandal
will not be a slight reshuffle of the last one. No
imagination here.
   Now good news. William Patrick, author of the previous
medical thriller "Spiral," has magnificently finessed the
end-of-the-Cold-War/end-of-history blues now affecting the
spy genre by going back to the real origin of the
20th-century malaise, to World War I. In "Blood Winter"
(Viking, 448 pages, $19.95) he evokes Berlin in 1917, a
desperate, doomed town. It's eerily timely too, as Berlin
seems about to be as central to the 1990s as it was to the
1910s.
   The novel opens in a powerful, masterly tone: "Black crows
hung in butcher shop windows all across Germany that winter.
The joke in Berlin was that soon there would be no more rat
to eat, only rat substitute. It was the third year of the
war. . . ." And the hardscrabble physical atmosphere of
Berlin is matched by an array of desperate, often crazed
human fauna. The hero is an idealistic spy, an American
doctor, Eli Gordon, who's been working in France in trench
hospitals and is persuaded by British intelligence (the U.S.
not yet being in the war) to go to Berlin to see if the
Boches are developing bacteriological warfare devices. Eli's
finds his first lead he finds eaten by a Siberian tiger in
the Berlin Zoo. His next, more productive contact is
brilliant U.S.-born biologist Margarethe Riesling, a
tormented genius currently being exploited by exotic creeps
like the perverted head of German Intelligence and the
Kaiser's sadistic dentist. (Nice Germans, and questionable
Allies, turn up too.)
   Eventually Eli and Margarethe flee with the biological red
herring by train, bike and foot across fields, marshes and
canals toward Holland and freedom -- only to meet diabolic
betrayal from unexpected quarters. This whole final journey,
as exciting as that in "39 Steps," becomes a redemptive
calvary, starred with love and marred by the century's tragic
paranoia. The book is a dazzling achievement, both gripping
and moving, lurid and achingly sad. It is at least as
authoritative as the fresh early best of Greene and Le Carre.
It seems it takes "only" an intimate feel for history, a real
knowledge of something (here Berlin and science), and
imaginative intuitings of human nature to revivify a flagging
genre -- or let's just say, to write a good novel.
