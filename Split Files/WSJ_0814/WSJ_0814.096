   Brian Donovan is a young University of Michigan dropout
with no clear direction in his life. But his days of drifting
end abruptly when his family asks him to deliver $10,000 in
"gun money" to his fighting cousins in northern Ireland.
   According to family lore, Brian's grandfather, Patrick
Donovan, had killed a policeman in his youth and been forced
to leave Ireland forever. He went on to strike it rich in
America, settling in Detroit, but has never failed to send
regular donations to support the Republican cause back home.
Now in failing health, and sensing that this may be his last
contribution, Patrick insists that it be delivered personally
by a Donovan family member. Young Brian gets the assignment.

   So begins James Hynes's first novel, "The Wild Colonial
Boy" (Atheneum, 356 pages, $18.95), a political thriller with
a conventionally twisting plot that, because of its setting,
raises a few moral questions for the reader -- if only
occasionally for Brian, an innocent and sometimes a fool.
Brian, who likes to call himself a socialist and harbors some
sentimental sympathies for his grandfather's birthplace, is
essentially naive about the frustrations and dangers of
everyday life in war-torn Belfast.
   It doesn't take one of his Irish cousins, a beautiful,
passionate city councilor for West Belfast named Maire, much
time to realize that Brian would make the perfect courier for
some stolen Czech-made plastique. Maire's husband, the leader
of an extremist branch of the IRA named Jimmy Coogan, plans
to use the explosives to protest what he sees as a sellout to
the British.
   Only slowly does Brian begin to understand some of the
complexities of a situation mired in history and local
infighting. Traditionally, elected Republican officials from
Northern Ireland who are entitled to take a seat in the Irish
Dail, or Parliament, have abstained in protest. But now there
are rumors that a current IRA leader, Joe Brody, plans to
break tradition by taking his seat in the Dail and, in a step
toward reconciliation, is making overtures to the British
left.
   Jimmy Coogan sees Brody's political maneuverings as a
betrayal of traditional IRA militancy and he responds in the
traditional manner of the IRA militant, choosing a civilian
bomb target to express his disapproval: London's National
Gallery, to him a symbol of the detested, elitist Thatcherite
government. (Never mind that the Thatcher government can
hardly be accused of coddling its cultural institutions).
Coogan isn't about to transport the explosives himself -- his
face is too well-known to both the British and Brody's men.
The arrival of Brian, the quintessential American tourist, is
a godsend for Coogan.
   Soon, Brian is packing the plastique into his rucksack,
recognizing his own foolhardiness, yet unable to resist
Jimmy's dare. Complications arise almost immediately, most
troublesomely in the form of a pretty American tourist, Clare
Delaney, to whom Brian is instantly attracted. As they travel
together, Clare is never quite sure why Brian gasps every
time a policeman comes into view, but she likes him just the
same.
   In the meantime, Maire is arrested and interrogated by the
British, who find her wearing Brian's money belt. Not long
thereafter, Jimmy is gunned down by Brody's men as he is
heading back into Northern Ireland, just a hundred feet from
the border. Left behind are his operatives, who are waiting
to detonate Brian's bomb in the National Gallery.
   "The whole Irish past seems like yesterday," the critic
Hugh Kenner has written. And although the Ireland of James
Hynes's novel boasts as many fast-food restaurants as pubs,
with billboards of Sylvester Stallone looming over the Dublin
landscape, its political climate seems eerily frozen in time.
Mr. Hynes observes the same gaunt, haunted young men in
Belfast as must have paced the streets during the time of the
civil war in 1922. Jimmy Coogan compares Brody's sellout to
that of past Irish heroes who have "lost sight of the goal":
Michael Collins in 1921 and Eamon de Valera 10 years later.
Then as now, lives continue as factional violence threatens
everyday existence in a devastated country.
   "The Wild Colonial Boy" (the title comes from an Irish
song) suffers from uneven characterization. Mr. Hynes's
emphasis is fixed on Maire, Jimmy and Brian, while Joe Brody,
a potentially fascinating and pivotal character, remains
shadowy. Neither is it easy to believe that even someone as
feckless as Brian would really be dumb enough to carry 10
pounds of plastique all the way to London.
   On the whole, however, Mr. Hynes has produced a competent,
well-plotted thriller. He is judicious in his use of
melodrama, a favorite device in thrillers; when he employs it
(in one scene, Maire, having been told of Jimmy's death while
in prison, angrily sings an ancient Celtic song to the
British authorities), he generally manages to exercise
restraint. The author is sensitive in his handling of the
sickening violence that spreads through this sad terrain. And
while he understands the forces that drive a man like Coogan
to terrorism, he also dwells on the horrifying results of
fanaticism -- in this case the death of 11 innocent people.
What sets "The Wild Colonial Boy" apart from other books of
its kind is Mr. Hynes's clear compassion for every one who
suffers in the Irish predicament, a compassion that lends
weight and depth to an otherwise rather standard adventure
novel.
