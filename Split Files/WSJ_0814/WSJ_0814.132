   MILAN -- In Italy's fashion capital, the vogue this summer
is short skirts, sheer fabrics -- and clashing cultures.
   "Africans and Italians don't mix," says Michele Corti, his
face red with sun and rage. Mr. Corti, an agricultural
researcher, has organized a protest against new housing for
Arabs and Africans in Milan. Sweltering beneath a statue of
Leonardo da Vinci, the protesters wave placards saying,
"Milan Is Becoming the Bronx of Italy]" and "Casbah? No Thank
You]"

   As the rally swells, a Senegalese street peddler named
Ngor packs up his imitation Louis Vuitton handbags and
hurries off. "I am just doing what Italians did in America
100 years ago," the 27-year-old immigrant says. "Trying to
make a living."
   Throughout Western Europe, societies that once sent their
huddled masses across the Atlantic now are fending off the
tired and poor from teeming Third World shores. With European
economies booming and fertility rates plummeting -- Italy's
is now the world's lowest -- the need for immigrant labor has
soared. But as Third World people pour into Europe, the
differing cultures collide. Friction could well become more
frequent and more intense if the fallout from Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait creates an anti-Arab backlash. Even long before the
invasion, Europe's racial problems were getting ugly:
   -- In March, masked Italians rampaged through the streets
of Florence, clubbing and knifing North Africans.
   -- In April, on Hitler's birthday, neo-Nazis in Berlin
assaulted African workers and clashed with Turkish street
gangs.
   -- During one week in May, Swedish youths firebombed
refugee camps eight times, hospitalizing 12 immigrants.
   -- In June, baton-wielding Spanish police were accused of
beating 10 Africans camped out in Madrid's central square.
   In some European countries, moreover, the native
population is already declining, while that of many African
and Arab nations is doubling every 20 to 25 years. And with
Europe's internal borders set to dissolve in 1992, an
immigrant arriving in Genoa or Marseilles could roam and work
freely all across the Continent.
   As East/West tensions fade, "immigration is the biggest
problem facing the whole European community," says Remy
Leveau, a French political scientist. Adds Italian
demographer, Massimo Livi-Bacci, "This isn't something like
Japanese cars that you can control with a yearly quota. If
the right balance isn't found, the situation could explode."
                                                                                                       

   Germany
                                                                                                       

   And it already has in some cities. Barricaded inside an
East Berlin garret, a young man with swastikas and storm
troopers tattooed on his arm explains the stance of a new
group called National Alternative. "If you mix races in
Germany, it never works," says Heiko Baumert, flanked by
other young men with shaved heads and black, steel-toed
boots. "We want to wake up Germans and pressure the state to
kick foreigners out."
   National Alternative primarily objects to 90,000
immigrants in East Germany, most of whom were imported from
fellow Marxist states in Vietnam, Cuba, Mozambique and
Angola. Formed in February, National Alternative set up
headquarters just a few streets from the tall, tattered
apartment blocks where most of the immigrants live. "Germans
Defend Yourselves]" proclaims one of the group's banners. On
a Saturday night, spotlights shine from the roof, and youths
patrol the street outside, clutching baseball bats beneath
their paramilitary jackets. To passers-by, they offer
pamphlets decrying the "foreign viruses in our city."
   Asked if such echoes of the Third Reich are intentional,
Mr. Baumert shrugs. "It is demagoguery to ignore the
achievements of the Nazis," he says.
   The group, which receives aid and advice from neo-Nazis in
West Germany and Austria, has a hard core of only about 300
members, and police recently forced them to find new
headquarters. But its doctrine has found fertile ground among
East Germans worrying about their jobs. The men's room of a
nearby nightclub is scrawled with graffiti -- "Sieg Heil" and
"Foreigners Out" -- and youths at the bar have used chains
and clubs to battle black Africans in an adjoining apartment
block.
   East German officials say immigrants' employment and
residency contracts -- usually running five years -- will be
honored, though some employers are laying off foreigners as
free-market reforms shrink the work force. Other workers
aren't waiting for pink slips. In front of a building labeled
"Workers Living Quarters, Bloc-A, Number 315," Vietnamese men
bang together crates marked "Hanoi" and "Haiphong" and pile
their possessions inside.
   "I don't want to go home, but I don't want to die,
either," says a 30-year-old factory worker, Phung Tien. In
June, Mr. Tien watched as skinheads stabbed and killed one of
his friends in East Berlin's central square. German
co-workers at the factory call him "Vietsi" -- an insult
roughly equivalent to "Jap" -- and ask why he doesn't go back
where he came from.
   More than 5,000 Vietnamese in East Germany have applied
this year for asylum in West Berlin. But tension also is
running high on the west side of the fallen Wall, where
287,000 foreign workers live. German law makes it hard for
"guest workers" to become citizens, and many immigrants fear
that the first economic downturn will make them expendable.
   "Why should anyone hire a Turk when they can get a skilled
East German for the same price?" asks Mehmet Kabuk, who
migrated from Anatolia to West Berlin 20 years ago.
   Mr. Kabuk runs a kebab shop in Kreutzberg, a Turkish
enclave abutting the Wall and crowded with mosques,
belly-dance clubs and butchers selling meat slaughtered
according to Islamic rules. For Turkish migrants, this little
Istanbul was once the Promised Land. In his 20s, Mr. Kabuk
opened his own shop, and at 31 he now clears the equivalent
of $2,500 a month, four times what he could earn in Turkey.
He has a new Mercedes parked out front. "My mother said we'd
eat three or four eggs a day in Berlin and watch TV," Mr.
Kabuk recalls. "She was right."
   When the Wall was breached last fall, Mr. Kabuk handed out
free shish kebab to the East Germans flooding in and looked
forward to a boom in his business. But in the months since,
he has often been abused by German customers, and he has even
scuffled with them in his shop. Then, one day, he woke to
find "Turks Out]" painted on the wall of a kindergarten by
his house, beside a crude sketch of a child hanging from a
gallows. He has decided to take his wife and two Berlin-born
children back to Turkey, but he worries about the adjustment
after so many years abroad. "We are foreigners in both
lands," he says.
   Turkish alienation, and anxiety, have fueled the rise of
Turkish street gangs. Wearing American football jerseys and
adopting names such as the Vikings, Black Panthers and Crazy
Kick Brothers, they are being blamed for a wave of assaults
and petty crimes in West Berlin. Right-wing skinheads are a
favored target.
   "If any Nazis come near here now," says a gang member
named Ali, running a finger along his throat, "we'll show
them a little Islamic justice." He adds, "I hear it is easy
to get guns in America. Can you bring some next time you
come?"
                                                                                                       

   France
                                                                                                       

   France, like Germany, has a large foreign community that
now feels under siege. Immigrants -- largely North African --
make up about 8% of France's 55 million people. France also
has Europe's strongest anti-immigration movement, Jean-Marie
Le Pen's National Front.
   "If integration between Islamic immigrants and the French
were possible, it would have happened already," says Mr. Le
Pen, speaking from his luxurious villa near Paris. His
solution to the immigration problem: "We must make these
people go back to their homes."
   Dismissed as a racist fringe group just a few years ago,
the front has won seats in the European Parliament and local
government; it captured more than a third of the vote in
working-class districts of Marseilles. The front also is
active at the grass-roots level. Under posters saying
"Immigration Stop" and "Let's Make France for the French,"
the front's social workers in Marseilles hold weekly open
houses and help residents with pensions, civil-service jobs
and other paper work.
   "No one else will help me," says Lucille Champoussin, an
unemployed 60-year-old. "I was born here, have lived all my
life here, and I don't have a right to anything. But these
Arabs get everything. It just isn't right."
   Youssef Mendani also has lived in Marseilles his whole
life and feels he hasn't had a right to much, either. The
22-year-old son of Algerian immigrants shares a small
apartment with seven siblings in a housing project adjacent
to a junkyard. Children play jungle gym in a burned-out
delivery truck. Young men linger idly in groups, joking in
Arabic that they are "holding up" the project's cracked
concrete walls.
   Mr. Mendani finds that his French citizenship doesn't rule
out racism. He was tossed out of junior high school when
officials restricted the number of immigrant students. He
dropped out of another school when a teacher said his
background suited "Arab work," such as heavy labor, rather
than the languages he wanted to study.
   "Everyone talks of getting out," he says, picking his way
across the broken glass and garbage on the project's grounds.
"But there is no place to go."
   Like many second-generation immigrants in Europe, Mr.
Mendani feels caught between cultures. He doesn't want to go
back to Algeria and its rising Islamic fundamentalism. But in
France, integration seems impossible. "Today is the same as
yesterday, and tomorrow will be the same, too," he writes in
a poem. "The express train roars past less than 100 feet way.
As it does, the old buildings tremble, and we do, too."
   In both France and Germany, the import of foreign workers
has stopped, though immigrant communities continue to grow
through births and laws allowing family reunion. But
opponents of immigration fear that the opening of Europe's
internal borders in 1992 will bring a fresh wave of Arabs and
Africans, with Italy the principal gateway.
                                                                                                       

   Italy
                                                                                                       

   For decades, manpower was Italy's biggest export; an
estimated 25 million Italians migrated overseas between 1870
and 1970. However, economic growth and falling birth rates --
as well as slim entry requirements -- have reversed the
trend. Now, Italy has about a million immigrants, and
thousands more arrive each week, often illegally. "The
Mediterranean," says Italy's foreign minister, Gianni de
Michelis, "is our Rio Grande."
   In the hot kitchen of a Milanese restaurant, a cook in a
tomato-spattered apron tosses spaghetti into boiling water
and stirs a pan of pesto. The cook is an agricultural
engineer from Egypt; so is the dishwasher working beside him.
   "Young Italians would rather steal than do kitchen work,"
says the restaurant's owner, Andrea Ferrari-Nasi. Hiring
immigrants hasn't hurt his business; the restaurant, which is
awarded one fork in the Michelin guide, is packed until
midnight.
   Mr. Ferrari-Nasi, though, says language and cultural
differences -- Muslims don't like handling pork, for example
-- make it hard to train Arabs. So, when planning to open a
second restaurant, he advertised for an Italian cook, waiter
and dishwasher. Two months later, he has received only one
response. "Every restaurant owner I know has the same
problem," he says.
   So do many other employers in Milan. A bakers' association
recently offered to train 5,000 immigrants for jobs it
couldn't fill. So did a merchants' group. Not surprisingly,
immigrants flock to the prosperous city from other parts of
Italy, especially Genoa, where ferries from North Africa
disgorge hundreds of newcomers each weekend. Milan now has an
estimated 70,000 foreign workers, up from about 5,000 just
two years ago.
   The influx has overwhelmed Italy's lumbering bureaucracy,
and baton-wielding police have beaten back restive migrants
lined up each dawn to apply for working papers. The mass
influx has created social strains, too. An abandoned farm
near Milan, where 700 Moroccans live in stables and share two
portable toilets, has had three mysterious fires this year;
officials suspect arson by right-wing Italians. When the city
proposed moving homeless immigrants to tent camps on its
outskirts, local residents blockaded the streets, and the
city backed off.
   Roberto Formigoni, a Christian Democrat from Milan and a
vice president in the European Parliament, blames much of
this friction on "campanilismo" -- roughly, "worship of one's
own church spire."
   "There is a long tradition in Italy of regarding anyone
from outside your own village with suspicion," he says.
Earlier in the postwar period, northern Italians directed
this provincialism at poor migrants from the south. Now, they
feel threatened by Africans and Arabs.
   In Florence, anger at foreign street merchants boiled over
this spring, and several immigrants were severely beaten. A
month later in Genoa, a deranged Tunisian's assault on a
small girl sparked two days of vigilante reprisals; residents
threw bottles and set guard dogs on North Africans. The
Milan-based Lombard League, which seeks regional autonomy and
tough curbs on immigration, captured 19% of the vote in
regional elections in May -- second only to the Christian
Democrats.
   The Italian government has tried to walk a tightrope
between native anger and the need for good relations with its
Mediterranean neighbors. New laws this February offered
amnesty to immigrants in the country before 1990 but
tightened restrictions on newcomers and set large penalties
for employers who hire illegals. Under pressure from the
European Community, Spain also is tightening entry
requirements for Moroccans and Latin Americans.
   The Italian demographer, Mr. Livi-Bacci, views the trend
to restricting immigration as short-sighted. As Europe's
population ages, he says, the need for working-age migrants
is sure to increase. And he adds that blocking immigration
could roil countries such as Egypt and Morocco, which rely
heavily on remittances from workers abroad.
   In the Loreto subway station in Milan, it is easy to
discern the new Europe that anti-immigrationists fear. Every
noon, Senegalese migrants gather at a cafe there to exchange
letters from home and information about jobs and housing. In
one corner, an Italian-speaking migrant helps a newcomer fill
out a form for a merchant's license. In another, two men with
braided hair and African robes discuss going to Belgium,
where pay is said to be high.
   "A lot of people in Senegal have never heard of Rome, but
everyone knows Loreto," says Youssoupha Kalla, a street
merchant in Italy for two years. "This is the place you come
to get rich."
   Mr. Kalla, 26, has a wife and child in Senegal, and seven
siblings -- one already in Italy, another in France. He had
hoped to bring the rest of his family to Italy but delayed
his plans because of a recent crackdown on street peddlers in
Milan. Now jobless and bothered by the rising racial tension,
he is thinking of returning to Senegal -- but just for a few
months.
   "I need Italy, and Italy needs people like me," he says,
folding up his newspaper. "I will be back."
