   SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government is
keeping its promise to open up Korea's advertising market to
foreign ad agencies, but it's still difficult to get an ad on
television here.
   It's not that foreign advertisers face discrimination.
Korean advertisers are having as much trouble as foreign
companies trying to get television time because demand so
exceeds supply.

   "If more time was available, every client I talked to
would add a third to his {advertising} budget," says David
Healy, who recently set up an office for McCann-Erickson Inc.
Some advertising executives in Seoul think there is $25
million in business each day waiting for air time.
   The root of the problem is the way the South Korean
government regulates television. There are only two
television companies in South Korea and both are
government-owned. Commercials are limited to 8% of broadcast
time and are shown in clusters at the beginning and end of
programs.
   To make matters worse, Korean stations only broadcast a
few hours a day. They don't broadcast from midnight to 6 a.m.
And they usually can't broadcast between 10 a.m. and 5:30
p.m. on weekdays, which doesn't allow advertisers to reach
the all-important housewife. "We are forced to buy what we
don't want to buy just to get on," says Martin H. Cohan,
president of a local advertising agency that J. Walter
Thompson plans to buy.
   (Print advertising doesn't suffer from these problems.
Newspapers and magazines have proliferated in Korea without
direct interference from the government since 1987.)
   Korea's ad market is small, about $1.8 billion a year
compared with $130 billion in the U.S. this year, but it is
the second largest in Asia after Japan, and it is growing at
about 25% to 30% a year. The Korean government estimates that
the average urban wage-earner's household income is about
$15,000 a year and rising.
   A growing number of companies, including Citicorp's
Citibank, candy maker Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble, have
recognized that Koreans are getting richer and more eager to
buy their goods and services. Nestle is the biggest foreign
advertiser, ranking 15th among all Korea's advertisers with
expenditures of 4.6 billion won, or about $6.5 million, in
the first half of 1990.
   Under pressure from foreign and domestic advertisers
alike, the Korean government is slowly addressing the TV
advertising problem. The government recently authorized the
creation of a new "independent" network. It won't be owned by
the government, but the government will strongly influence
what is aired. When it begins broadcasting next year, ad
supply should increase by about a third. Government officials
say they probably won't increase the percentage of ad time on
television, but would "view positively" increasing the number
of broadcast hours.
   TV-ad time in Korea isn't cheap, but it isn't
unreasonable. A nationwide 30-second ad costs about 5.7
million won, or about $8,000. An ad for Seoul only costs
about 3.2 million won, or about $4,500.
   The use of foreign models, except in the background of
ads, isn't allowed, and apparently won't change. In support
of this policy, the government released a poll that shows
66.4% of Koreans are offended by the appearance of foreign
models in ads.
   Oh Choong Su of the Ministry of Information says the
government may consider allowing foreign-made commercials to
air on Korean TV. But the ads would have to be approved by
government censors before they could be broadcast. He says
Japanese commercials will be prohibited because Korea bans
Japanese cultural influences, such as movies and music.
   And all television advertising has to be placed by the
government agency, Korea Broadcasting Advertising Corp., or
Kobaco. Kobaco pays an ad agency a 10% commission and keeps a
10% commission from the network for itself. Ad executives in
Seoul say they would rather deal directly with the television
networks so they could make deals. But Mr. Cohan, who was the
instigator of market-opening measures in the mid-1980s, says
"Kobaco has gotten much nicer to work with."
   Mr. Healy says that advertisers have to be innovative and
look beyond television advertising, into areas such as events
sponsorship. "You have to think outside the square," he says.
"That's how foreign agencies can influence the market."
