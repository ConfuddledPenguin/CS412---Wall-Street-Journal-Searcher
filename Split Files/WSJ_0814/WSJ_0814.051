   Your July 5 article "Bright Outlook for Artificial
Intelligence Yields to Slow Growth and Big Cutbacks"
presented a myopic view of artificial-intelligence (AI)
technology and its commercial potential.
   You presented the opinions of self-appointed high-tech
industry analysts who focused on American companies and some
of AI's earliest technologies in the U.S. domestic market.
You did not consider the rapid growth of a new generation of
companies and products during the past two to three years in
the AI field. The commercial market impact of these new
companies and their products had not yet been fully realized.

   The article also failed to mention the active investments
that foreign venture capitalists and major corporations,
especially Japanese-based, have made in U.S.
artificial-intelligence companies.
