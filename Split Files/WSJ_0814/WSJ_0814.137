   JACKSON, N.H. -- Across the broad wood planks of the
covered bridge, past the white clapboard town hall and up
into the hills stands a 1786 structure that may be becoming
one of the most unlikely power centers in American politics
today. It is a hostelry called the Christmas Farm Inn, and
the rooms carry names like Vixen, Dancer and Donner.
   The man who owns the inn, Bill Zeliff, is a former
antifreeze marketing specialist, and this summer he emerged
as one of the leading contenders in perhaps the wildest
congressional primary of the season. His rivals in this
Republican race include a man who owns a dairy farm, an Agway
outlet and a crafts shop; a career naval officer who has
become an auctioneer; an insurance adjuster who wants to
eliminate dairy subsidies; a former Democrat who wants to
legalize drugs; and a man whose family runs Six Gun City, a
replica of an Old West town tucked away, incongruously, in
the northernmost reaches of the White Mountains.

   "Only in New Hampshire," says state Sen. Bill Johnson, the
auctioneer and sometime real-estate salesman.
   But the race to succeed GOP Rep. Robert Smith, who is
running for the Senate, is more than just a reminder of the
quirkiness of a state whose politics are as colorful as the
leaves that line the Presidential Range each fall. It is a
snapshot of the various elements of the Republican coalition.
   "This race in many ways represents the entire range of the
Republican Party," says Thomas Rath, a former GOP attorney
general prominent in Granite State politics. "Anybody who
wants to play in this game can find someone whose tent he
fits under. This is the Republican Party."
   Together the eight contenders are the political proof of
Robert Frost's theorem, that New Hampshire contains "one each
of everything as in a showcase."
   True to form, each of them claims a shard of the party.
Mr. Zeliff, the innkeeper, is widely believed to be former
Gov. John Sununu's favorite in the race, though the White
House chief of staff is trying to keep a proper distance.
Douglas Scamman, who owns the dairy farm and serves as the
speaker of the New Hampshire House for $125 a year, is the
choice of the Statehouse gang. Larry Brady, a former Commerce
Department official, is the favorite of the devoutly
conservative Manchester Union Leader newspaper. Dean Dexter,
a county commissioner and former state representative, claims
the support of evangelical Republicans. Sen. Johnson boasts
of the support he has among the state's motorcycle riders,
grateful to him for helping to kill a mandatory-helmet bill
last year.
   The GOP field also includes Dennis Hogan, a 25-year-old,
one-term state House member with a campaign budget of $6,000,
and Chris Tremblay, who runs a construction company and is
portraying himself as "a guy who's just a member of America's
working class."
   "Every interest in the party is involved in this," says
Republican Gov. Judd Gregg, who hasn't endorsed a candidate.
"But there is one thing they have in common: every one of
them says he is a conservative. That's because everyone in
New Hampshire is a conservative."
   Not exactly. State Rep. Michael Weddle of Portsmouth, who
has only been a Republican since February, was an early
opponent of the Vietnam War, has been arrested twice
protesting outside the Seabrook nuclear power plant and
supported a Martin Luther King holiday, which hasn't been
enacted here. "I remain critical of the Republicans," he
says. But he switched parties because he calculated that the
campaign leading to the Sept. 11 GOP primary would be a good
forum for his platform of "immediate legalization" of
marijuana and the licensing of other drugs. He is given
almost no chance of winning.
   The winner of this madcap GOP race will face either Joseph
Keefe, a Manchester lawyer who is heavily favored in the
Democratic primary and regarded as a future Democratic star
in the state, or his rival, state Sen. Bobby Stephen, a
conservative, anti-abortion, blue-collar Democrat who is
campaigning on an anti-tax platform.
   The setting for this struggle is the 88 communities in the
eastern congressional district of New Hampshire, stretching
from the state's 13 miles of coastline to what a 17th-century
British adventurer called the "daunting terrible" peaks of
the White Mountains. The region has spawned both "The Great
Stone Face," Nathaniel Hawthorne's well-loved tale of mystery
and honor, and "Peyton Place," Grace Metalious's story of sin
and small towns. It includes both Phillips Exeter Academy and
Mr. Scamman's farm-supply outlet.
   For the past several months, the eight candidates have
trooped through small industrial towns built around old
river-powered mills, visited defense factories planted along
the highways, lingered in tiny hamlets dropped between the
notches of the north country and courted the large
Franco-American community of Manchester, all to little
effect. One poll shows more than two-thirds of the voters are
undecided.
   Not that the contenders are going to need much support.
The last time the congressional seat was open, in 1986, it
took only 9,000 votes to win the GOP nomination. "The shame
is that there aren't enough Democratic votes to take
advantage of the chaos," says David Van Note, a leading
Democrat in North Conway. The Democrats cannot be counted out
-- Norman D'Amours, a Democrat, held the seat for a decade --
but this remains Republican territory, especially in the
northern part of the district. "I'm a little old white-haired
lady," says Marion Putnam, president of the Conway Historical
Society, "and almost everybody I know is a Republican."
   The other GOP candidates are spending most of their time
attacking Mr. Zeliff, whose well-financed campaign will be
the only one to put television commercials on the air and who
is campaigning with a penny jar that he says symbolizes his
commitment to watch federal spending. His rivals are arguing
that the innkeeper is an outsider who, in the words of Mr.
Scamman, is "trying to buy" the election.
   But the Christmas Farm Inn has emerged as something of a
GOP political clubhouse, and such luminaries as Barbara Bush
and members of the Sununu family have lingered on the inn's
venerable green porch. The apparent support of Mr. Sununu --
his son attended a Zeliff fund-raiser and his wife remarked
that she favors the innkeeper -- is also antagonizing some in
the field of candidates.
   "I served the administration that George Bush was a part
of for three years, and I don't appreciate his chief of staff
coming in here like some King Tut, some Middle Eastern
potentate," says Mr. Brady, who became an acclaimed
whistleblower when he revealed that Carter administration
technology transfers were assisting the manufacture of Soviet
tanks. "It's just unfair."
   Mr. Brady, however, has been the beneficiary of support
from the Union Leader, whose headlines have boomed: "Well
Said, Larry Brady"; "Brady was First"; "Brady's Prescience";
"Give 'Em Hell, Larry"; and "Brady Bunch: Not for Wimps."
   At the same time, the paper is portraying Mr. Scamman, who
has a 200-head dairy operation at Bittersweet Farm, as "a
taxer" for his support of an increase in the state's
business-profits tax and in the realestate transfer tax. Mr.
Scamman's picture has run under headlines such as: "The Big
Loser"; "Drunk on Power"; "Devious Doug"; and "Scamman for
Congress?"
   But even Mr. Scamman's rivals know that the newspaper
can't choose the nominee, and the House speaker remains a
major force in perhaps the most unpredictable contest of the
year. "You literally have to shake as many hands as you can
to win this," says Mark Brady, Mr. Brady's son and campaign
manager. "It's a mess, but its how we do things here."
