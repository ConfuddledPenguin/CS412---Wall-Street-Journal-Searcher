   OMAHA, Neb. -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s increased
earnings from recent "white-squire" investments pushed
second-quarter net income higher, despite a drop in capital
gains.
   The diversified concern, controlled by stock-picker Warren
Buffett, said net climbed 7.5% to $94 million, or $81.95 a
share, from the year-earlier $87.4 million, or $76.27 a
share.

   Earnings from Berkshire's operations -- its insurance,
manufacturing, merchandising and services lines -- rose 33%
to $82.9 million, or $72.32 a share, compared with the
year-earlier earnings from operations of $62.4 million, or
$54.45 a share.
   Earnings from Berkshire's nearly $2 billion in holdings of
four issues of cumulative convertible preferred stock
contributed to the higher income. Those holdings include
substantial convertible preferred holdings, acquired in the
latter part of 1989, in Gillette Co., USAir Group Inc. and
Champion International Corp.
   As with a similar 1987 investment in Salomon Inc., such
so-called white squire buy-ins can help companies deter
would-be raiders, because Mr. Buffett typically promises not
to sell the stake he's acquiring, or to join forces with
hostile suitors, for several years.
   Berkshire Hathaway said after-tax earnings from the four
issues was about $38.5 million in the latest quarter,
compared with investment income of about $13.5 million in the
year-ago period, when it held only the Salomon preferred. The
company noted that the higher investment income was partially
offset by higher interest costs related to borrowings to fund
the 1989 preferred-stock purchases.
   Berkshire Hathaway's realized investment gain, which
fluctuates widely, dropped in the latest period to $11
million, or $9.63 a share, from the year-earlier quarter's
$25 million, or $21.82 a share.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Berkshire Hathaway shares slipped $75 to close at $6,700 a
piece.
