   A federal judge pushed forward with plans for a
class-action lawsuit likely to benefit former asbestos makers
who say they are running out of money.
   In federal court in Brooklyn, New York, U.S. District
Judge Jack B. Weinstein also said he expects that funds from
those companies will be combined with the Manville trust to
settle the asbestos personal-injury claims. And he indicated
that he will take a hard line on plaintiffs' attorney fees.

   The move was the first step in carrying out a joint effort
announced by 10 federal judges Friday to come up with a
nationwide resolution of the asbestos suits. The backlog of
asbestos personal-injury cases across the country now totals
about 90,000, and tens of thousands more are expected in the
years ahead. Most of the victims are former construction and
shipyard workers who developed cancer or respiratory
illnesses years after their exposure to the insulation
material.
   The motion asking Judge Weinstein to approve a class
action was made by Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. of
Cincinnati, which claims that it and some other defendants
don't have enough money to continue fighting asbestos cases
individually.
   "We believe there is a general risk that the assets of
Eagle-Picher and other defendants may be insufficient to meet
the claims," said Arvin Maskin, an attorney for the
Eagle-Picher.
   Under Friday's agreement, the class action before Judge
Weinstein can include as many as six asbestos defendants, if
it is shown that as a group they indeed lack enough assets to
pay future claims. Judge Weinstein set a hearing for tomorrow
to begin examining the financial condition of Eagle-Picher
and the other defendants. He said the analysis would be
completed within three weeks. He also appointed former
federal judge Marvin E. Frankel to determine whether
defendants' funds are inadequate.
   Although several companies have been mentioned as possible
co-defendants along with Eagle-Picher, none has asked to be
included in the case. Judge Weinstein has authority over the
Manville trust, which he has ordered to come up with new
financing to overcome its cash shortfall. The trust was
formed by Manville Corp. as part of its bankruptcy-court
reorganization in 1986 to pay asbestos claims.
   Gene Locks, an asbestos plaintiffs' attorney in
Philadelphia, asked Judge Weinstein to reject Eagle-Picher's
motion, questioning whether the company actually lacks funds.
He said the class action will reduce the amount of money
available to asbestos victims, and instead suggested that the
companies should turn to Chapter 11 protection under the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Judge Weinstein, however, said he doesn't favor "pushing
into bankruptcy major segments of our industrial base. . . .
We want to avoid forcing companies into bankruptcy if we
can." The judge also said that even though a company may
qualify for the class action, it doesn't mean the company is
insolvent.
   To reduce costs, the judge said plaintiffs' attorneys
would have to accept cuts in their fees. "It is intolerable,
given the limited funds, for two-thirds of the available
assets to go to transaction costs," mainly legal fees, the
judge said.

   IMMIGRATION ACT section is declared unconstitutional.
   The amendment, aimed at curbing drug trafficking, allows
legal aliens who have served prison sentences for certain
felonies to be jailed again -- indefinitely and without a
chance for bail -- while deportation proceedings are under
way.
   But in federal court in Manhattan, Judge Gerard Goettel
ruled that the requirement violates the U.S. Constitution by
not granting defendants the right to possible release on
bail. Although the government's intentions may have been
legitimate in fighting drug sales, the means used to enforce
the law "are excessive and violate {the defendant's}
substantive dueprocess rights," the judge ruled.
   "A bail hearing wouldn't pose significant fiscal or
administrative burdens on the government and would greatly
minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation of a liberty
interest," Judge Goettel wrote in his opinion. The case is
one of the first to challenge the regulation's
constitutionality.
   Arthur Helton, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights, which deals with immigration issues, said the
decision "is a judicial warning that neither Congress nor the
{Immigration and Naturalization Service} will be able to take
shortcuts in immigration law enforcement that fly in the face
of constitutional entitlements."
   Carolyn Goldfarb, an attorney for the prisoner who filed
the case, said she will seek a bail hearing soon. If not
released on bail, her client is expected to spend more time
in jail during the deportation process than the eight months
he served on his criminal conviction, she said.
   Timothy Macfall, an assistant U.S. attorney who handled
the case, said the government hasn't decided whether to
appeal.

   DEATH PENALTY case challenged on grounds of racial
discrimination.
   With aid from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, a black murder defendant in Georgia is trying to block
the use of the death penalty in his case, arguing that the
prosecutor has systematically discriminated against blacks.
   The fund asserts the case of William Anthony Brooks, who
is charged with killing a white female, is of national
significance because it is "a model of new defense strategies
that seek to prove purposeful discrimination in an entire
criminal justice jurisdiction" to meet the tougher standard
of proof now required by the U.S. Supreme Court under a 1987
case, McCleskey vs. Kemp.
   But attorneys with the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People were chagrined at a ruling
yesterday by Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson, which said the
defense, in asserting racial discrimination, could present
evidence only of discrimination by the current prosecutor --
Muscogee County District Attorney Douglas Pullen -- and not
of alleged discrimination by two previous district attorneys
who had been in office during the 17 years that Mr. Brooks'
case has dragged on. His earlier conviction was overturned on
a technicality by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Judge Lawson "gave a very narrow reading" of the McCleskey
ruling, said Daniel Fleshler, a spokesman for the fund.
   In its 1987 ruling, the Supreme Court, rejecting a major
challenge to the death penalty, refused to accept historical,
statistical evidence of possible racial bias in death
sentences as proof that an individual defendant's rights were
violated. The Supreme Court ruling means that death-penalty
defendants must prove on a case by case basis that they
suffered discrimination at the hands of a "decision maker,"
such as a judge, jury or prosecutor, in order to prove that
the use of the death penalty in their case is racially
motivated.
   At a hearing in Columbus, Ga., today, defense attorneys
plan to present evidence that the prosecution, among other
things, systematically weeds out potential black jurors from
jury panels that already include few blacks.
   The defense will also argue that the prosecutor focuses
his energies on prosecuting crimes against white victims,
giving short shrift to black victims who suffer a
disproportionate number of the area's crimes.
   Mr. Pullen, the prosecutor, said the charge of
discrimination was an attempt to divert attention from the
crime committed.
   Asked whether race entered into the state's decision to
seek the death penalty, Mr. Pullen said: "There might have
been a time when that would have been a significant factor,
but no more. This crime offended the whole community."

   JUDGE BARS U.S. from enforcing restrictions on "phone sex"
companies.
   Under a law that takes effect this week, companies that
charge a fee for sexually explicit telephone conversations
are required to take additional steps to make unauthorized
use of the phone sex services more difficult. But a federal
judge in Manhattan ruled that the restrictions, known as the
Helms Amendment for the law's sponsor, Sen. Jesse Helms, are
unconstitutionally vague and too severe.
   "The enforcement of the Helms Amendment presents a threat
of imminent, irreparable harm to First Amendment freedoms,"
said U.S. Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. in his order.
   The law requires phone companies to block access to adult
phone services unless a customer specifically requests the
ability to make such calls from his or herphone. The law also
requires that extra measures be taken to deter children from
calling the services, such as having the caller use a
password or pay with a credit card.
   Civil liberties lawyers have argued that the law infringed
on constitutionally protected speech between consenting
adults. The judge said Congress could come up with a less
restrictive way to keep children from using the services. He
also said the law is illegally vague because it doesn't
specify what constitutes the "indecent" speech it is meant to
restrict.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said it is
reviewing the case to determine whether to appeal.

   FOOTBALL CARD DISPUTE is settled by the NFL and Topps.
   In a joint announcement, Topps Co. and National Football
League Properties Inc., the league's licensing arm, stated
that there was an amicable settlement of the suit Topps
brought against the National Football League on June 28.
   The suit by Brooklyn-based Topps accused the NFL and
National Football League Properties of an "unlawful attempt
to block Topps" from selling its 1990 series of professional
football player cards.
   The suit alleged that by refusing to renew Topp's
licensing contract, the league and NFL Properties sought "to
eliminate Topps as a competitor to Pro Set Inc." Pro Set,
which is also licensed by the NFL, introduced its first cards
under the trademarks "NFL Pro Set" and "The Official NFL
Card" prior to the 1989 season. They were, according to
Topps, the top-selling football cards in 1989.
   Under terms of the settlement, a three-year license
agreement has been signed which calls for Topps to continue
to market its football player cards as an official licensee.
Topps football player cards will be on sale this month.
