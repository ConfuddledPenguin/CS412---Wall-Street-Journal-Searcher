   HOUSTON -- Margaret Holt, a silver-haired art dealer,
thought she had good credit. After all, she had always paid
her bills on time. But when she applied for an oil-company
credit card not long ago, she was told she had too many
delinquent debts outstanding.
   Her surprise turned to panic when she got a copy of her
credit report from a credit bureau. It showed nearly $40,000
in charges made in her name for items she had never ordered,
including a fur coat from Neiman Marcus and a leased
Mercedes-Benz.

   Mrs. Holt hired a private investigator. He traced the
spending spree to an unemployed woman with a name similar to
Mrs. Holt's, but 20 years younger and of a different race.
The impostor told Mrs. Holt she had gotten her Social
Security number and other credit data from a man who
counseled poor people on repairing their credit.
   Now Mrs. Holt is finding it nearly impossible to convince
some creditors that she isn't a cheat. "Somebody's got to
help me," she says, her eyes filling with tears. "I can't
stand for people to think those things about me, that I'm a
deadbeat."
   Notch up another victim of Houston's infamous "credit
doctors." Using laptop computers and stolen access codes,
these practitioners tap into credit-bureau data bases to
extract information -- names, loan histories, Social Security
numbers -- on people with good credit records. Then they sell
the information to clients with poor records to use when
applying for credit.
   The scam works. Since late 1987, when police began
investigating it here, purchases totaling nearly $20 million
have been traced to phony credit data. The loot includes
jewelry, television sets and vacation cruises. A Ford dealer
sold 90 new cars to buyers with doctored credit, including
eight members of a single family. An unemployed woman was
caught driving a Lincoln Continental outfitted with a
cellular telephone, and living in a $230,000 house. Another
woman bought at least five houses.
   Versions of the scam have begun to spread to other parts
of the country. In Chicago, the Treasury Department's Secret
Service has opened investigations of crimes involving the
abuse of credit bureau computers. In Los Angeles, a man
recently pleaded guilty to federal charges of mail fraud and
assuming a false identity in a scheme to get bank loans using
information he obtained on individuals from credit bureaus
and land deeds.
   Some see a dire threat. "Credit doctoring is an epidemic.
It's spreading like a virus," says Joseph LaBranche, a
Houston expert in credit-card fraud. "This is the crime of
the future."
   Warns Ralph Freeman, a security executive at First USA
Inc., a large Dallas credit-card issuer: "They're crashing
the credit system. There's so much bad information in the
credit bureaus now that if we pull something, we don't know
if it's true or not."
   Credit bureaus deny the problem is critical. "There is not
rampant illegal access into our system," says Susan Murdy, a
spokeswoman for TRW Inc.'s Credit Data Division in Los
Angeles. The three largest credit reporters -- TRW,
headquartered in Cleveland; Equifax Inc., Atlanta; and Trans
Union Corp., Chicago -- have invested heavily in security
systems that flag unauthorized intrusions. They also claim to
have made it more difficult for even legitimate subscribers
to browse through files without authorization.
   Houston's scams, however, show that technological
safeguards aren't foolproof. In some of the schemes,
otherwise-legitimate business people greedy for sales -- real
estate brokers, auto salesmen, bankers and salesclerks --
wittingly or not collaborated. They overlooked obvious frauds
and even referred customers to credit doctors.
   The buy now, pay later ethic, say fraud specialists, has
helped create a favorable climate. "Obviously the problem is
associated in an overall sense with the way we market in this
country," says Casey O'Brien, an assistant district attorney
here who has prosecuted several of the cases. "We appeal in
our advertising to everyone, even though everyone isn't
affluent. We make people want things they don't necessarily
need and then make {the goods} easy to get by extending
credit."
   In Houston, nobody knew how to get credit better than
Walter B. "Waldo" Hilton, a 70-year-old entrepreneur and
sometime Baptist preacher. Authorities regard him as the
pioneer of credit doctoring.
   A furniture and appliance salesman in the 1950s, Mr.
Hilton gained local fame in radio spots as "The Man with the
Plan" to help poor folks buy refrigerators on credit. The
plan? Each appliance came equipped with a coin-operated meter
that cut the electricity if the buyer failed to make a daily
installment payment of a quarter.
   After wig retailing and other ventures, Mr. Hilton
eventually took up one of the healing arts -- credit
doctoring. Often using the alias of "Rev. Jackson," he mostly
confined himself to helping people figure out how to pay off
their debts and get their names removed from deadbeat lists,
according to court records and people familiar with his
operation.
   But in 1984, he helped a young woman embellish a
department-store charge card application with fake
information showing her to be a $2,300-a-month accountant at
his Creditor and Consumer Service Corp. The woman's real
occupation was undercover detective for the store, and Mr.
Hilton was soon persuaded to plead guilty in Harris County
court here to lying on a loan application, a misdemeanor. He
was assessed a small fine.
   In partnership with a fellow Baptist preacher, James
Lawson, Mr. Hilton opened an office in a fancy, atrium-style
building. With a $600 Tandy computer, access codes allegedly
purchased from a credit bureau employee, and an angelic new
name -- Christian Financial Services Inc. -- the two
proceeded to do unto others.
   Through word of mouth, they brought in hundreds of clients
who had lost their credit and were desperate to regain it.
For fees that police say ranged between a few dollars and
$1,500, the doctors repaired their credit -- sort of. They
used the codes to access the files of the Credit Bureau of
Greater Houston, now known as CSC Credit Services Inc., and
retrieve those on people with names similar to their clients'
names. Then they simply chose one with a good credit history
and turned over to their client the information needed to
complete an acceptable credit application.
   A CSC official says the company has since tightened
security: Now a user with an access code must also enter
other factual information -- a real consumer's name and
address, at a minimum -- to call up a file. But police and
other security consultants say the doctors can easily jump
that hurdle by getting the needed information from a phone
book.
   A client, Leslie Bianchi, of Humble, Texas, says he found
out about Mr. Lawson from his real estate agent. Mr. Bianchi,
who had a shaky credit record, was trying to get a mortgage
loan. For $800, he says, Mr. Lawson "assigned" him a new
Social Security number, gave him two credit-card references,
and told him to use the information when applying for loans.
For another $200, Mr. Bianchi says, Mr. Lawson promised to
tell any inquisitive lenders that he employed Mr. Bianchi at
$48,000 a year. Mr. Bianchi was actually earning $27,000, as
production manager for a maker of oil-field gear.
   Mr. Bianchi says he had no idea at first that what he was
doing was illegal, but later had misgivings and dropped the
application. He wasn't charged with any crime. He says police
later told him his "new" Social Security number actually
belonged to another Bianchi living in the Midwest.
   In 1989, in another case, Mr. Lawson pleaded guilty in
state district court here to a single count of theft -- he
had used doctored credit to buy a van from a local car dealer
-- and was sentenced to five years in prison. Since released,
he couldn't be reached for comment.
   By the time Mr. Lawson was convicted, imitators already
had sprung up around the city.
   Forty-year-old George Gillum advertised his GCS Credit
Repair Service on radio and in newspapers around the country.
Police say that Mr. Gillum, among other things, bombarded
credit bureaus with letters contesting clients' records.
Because federal law requires the bureaus to refrain from
disclosing contested data while they investigate it, a
"window" opened for clients to borrow freely. When Mr. Gillum
was arrested, his office contained more than 1,000 files of
clients, among them a Houston policeman who, police say,
bought a new car while his credit record was being contested.
   Contesting a credit record isn't illegal, and Mr. Gillum
denies he ever broke the law to fix anyone's credit. But he
pleaded guilty in state court this year to six counts of
forging Social Security cards and received a $60,000 fine and
a three-year prison sentence. Mr. Gillum is appealing the
conviction, arguing that police used a faulty search warrant
to seize certain evidence.
   Real estate broker Joszef S. Walker, police say, doctored
credit histories to help clients obtain 13 houses from the
Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. He didn't have to hack into the credit
bureau's files: His real estate company, headquartered in a
weather-beaten yellow house, was a credit bureau member. Mr.
Walker, whose state court trial on multiple counts of theft
in connection with the house purchases is scheduled to start
here in October, has denied any wrongdoing.
   Some of the doctors spent as much time curing their own
credit ills as that of others. Credit doctor Terry Lynn
Jackson, who received two 10-year prison terms after pleading
guilty to theft in state court here, set up housekeeping in a
newly renovated home in the middle of one of Houston's
poorest neighborhoods and bought 26 cars for himself,
including a Mercedes-Benz. Police say he obtained all the
cards on credit of other Terry Jacksons around the country.
   Mr. Hilton, the pioneering doctor, had forgone the
trappings of wealth. For years, he served as associate pastor
of the Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church, a tiny,
weather-beaten church in Northwest Houston. The peeling sign
out front says: "MOTTO: IF YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN. IF YOU
DONT WANT TO DO YOU WONT."
   According to David Hefner, the Houston police detective
who caught him, Mr. Hilton said he wanted to undermine the
credit-granting process, viewing it as a form of slavery
imposed on blacks by whites. "I'm going to destroy the whole
credit system as we know it today," Mr. Hefner says Mr.
Hilton said.
   Mr. Hilton, interviewed at the door of his ramshackle home
in South Houston, disputes that version of the conversation
and denies being a credit doctor. Nonetheless, he pleaded
guilty in federal court this year to charges of possessing 15
or more unauthorized computer access codes with intent to
defraud. Shortly after the interview he began serving an
eight-month prison term.
   Whether or not Mr. Hilton intended it, his doctoring did
hit the credit system in these parts like an explosion. Every
client became a walking time bomb, set to detonate as soon as
he or she stopped making payments. Banks, car dealerships and
retailers suddenly began racking up huge fraud losses.
Innocents whose histories were filched still live in terror
of the dunning notices that keep coming for things they
didn't buy.
   "When it first happened to me, I felt raped -- there's no
other word for it," says Linda Brown Davis, a real estate
broker in Corpus Christi, Texas. Another woman had gotten
credit cards in Mrs. Davis's name, bought a new Cadillac and
was about to get a $35,000 home-improvement loan when she was
caught. Mrs. Davis says her credit file now has a notice to
lenders that she has been victimized by fraud. Still, two
credit-card companies recently rejected her applications.
   Herman West, a 58-year-old school-bus driver, says he was
"ruined" by somebody who used his name and credit record to
get a piano, a bunch of credit cards and a Dodge pickup. "I'm
telling you, man, I owed people I never heard of," he says.
"I'm scared to buy anything now."
   Perhaps the biggest jolt hit Jean Wright, who, as a
college student living alone in a one-bedroom apartment in
1987, received a past-due notice for a $500 electric bill. A
little checking revealed that somebody hadn't only stiffed
the electric company in Ms. Wright's name; that person had
filed a personal bankruptcy petition using Ms. Wright's name
and Social Security number. The petition, still on file in
U.S. bankruptcy court here, lists nearly $100,000 in bills,
including a $64,000 mortgage on a Humble, Texas, house.
   Investigators for CSC traced the bankruptcy petition and
other alleged frauds to Wilma Wright Sturges, a member of Mr.
Hilton's Fellowship Missionary congregation. She has pleaded
no-contest to a charge of theft of a house and been sentenced
to 10 years' probation. She is expected to testify in the
trial of Mr. Walker, the real estate broker and alleged
credit doctor for whom she worked.
   But, she says, "I am not a criminal]" And, pointing with a
dramatic sweep at the sky: "My security is not down here. My
security is up there]"
