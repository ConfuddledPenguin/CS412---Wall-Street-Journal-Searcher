   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Back straight and belly bulging, Lee
Riethmiller does a "plie" as his hand chop-chop-chops at the
air above his hairy head. I ape his every move and join my
classmates in a chorus of Portuguese:

   "Nos? Nos falamos, nos falamos, ate a Mulher Maravilha
fala e falou. Os cogumelos falam, falam, falam, e ontem
falaram, falaram, como animais, como frangos selvagens]"
                                                                                                       

   Which means:
   "Us? We speak, we spoke, even Wonder Woman speaks and
spoke. The mushrooms speak, speak, speak, and yesterday they
spoke, they spoke, like animals, like wild chickens]"
   In German, the mushrooms find, find, find, like
"Jakobsmuscheln," or scallops. In Italian, President
Cespuglio (Bush) hops a train with "innumerevoli cavoli," or
countless cabbages.
   "Wow, that's great," Mr. Riethmiller says. Nonsense it may
be, yet he assures us we've got the beat. But I am baffled
and vaguely crave a seafood stew. Is this any way to learn a
foreign language?
   Not on your "dolce vita, amigo." This is a way to learn
eight of them -- in one class called Octalingual. Not just
Portuguese, German and Italian, but Arabic, French, Japanese,
Russian and Spanish, too. No one except Mr. Riethmiller has
taught it.
   Octalingual is just for openers. On Tuesdays, Mr.
Riethmiller teaches a seven-language class, confusingly
called Quintalingual (quinta, signifying "quintessential," he
says, not five). In December, he will pull out all the
glottal stops and unveil Decalingual, as in 10.
   The limber-lobed Mr. Riethmiller -- Fulbright scholar,
Harvard Divinity School graduate and leader of a blues band
called Street Lips -- owns and runs the Intercontinental
Foreign Language Program, a private school here. With antic
style and the 11 foreign languages he speaks, he vows to hurl
the lingually lax U.S. into the international age.
   Given "the tide of history" -- Europe 1992, unwalled
Berlin, a global economy and all that -- Mr. Riethmiller
figures everyone will need to speak a bunch of languages
pretty soon. But present teaching methods, he says, aren't up
to the task. Besides, most aspiring U.S. polylinguists are
pressed for time. So Mr. Riethmiller ignores what went down
at Babel and sells languages by the bushel.
   "I don't consider myself a visionary, but this is the way
language will be taught in the 21st century," he says. "I am
the future mainstream."
   For people still living in the 20th century, his school
teaches standard one-language classes -- French I, Yoruba II,
Advanced Urdu and more. But about 60 of the 350 students in
the school pay up to $340 per eight-week term for the
multilingual courses. In addition to Octalingual's eight, Mr.
Riethmiller also speaks Amharic, Greek and Turkish. The
seven-language Quintalingual course is Octalingual minus the
Russian.
   Does it work? "Absolutely," says Natasha Yakovlev, a
former French teacher enrolled in Octalingual. "I love it. I
look forward to it, and I'm picking up all sorts of stuff."
Despite "all the crap I'm taking from my friends," adds
Boston real estate developer Paul Varadian, another
octa-pupil, "I think I'm learning something."
   Mr. Riethmiller says it takes about three years to attain
fluency in the eight languages, but no one has gone that far
yet, since Octalingual only began in May. Foreign language
specialists, although impressed by Mr. Riethmiller's talents,
are somewhat skeptical.
   "Let's face it: The human nervous system rejects
conflict," says Harry Rosser, chairman of the Romance
Languages department at Boston College. "I don't see how he
can control the chaos." Adds Judith E. Liskin-Gasparo, a
specialist in language teaching methods at Middlebury College
in Vermont: "The guy is probably a genius . . . but I suspect
he's teaching a lot of memorized vocabulary and phrases, and
that's no substitution for language proficiency."
   Mr. Riethmiller's retort: "Here's what's really happening.
I'm out there first. No one has even imagined this. I'm
creating it, producing it, directing it, performing it. Of
course it will be a total change in the society. There's no
one out there in the universities who could possibly judge it
or say whether it works. I know it works. It works for me. It
works for others. The alternative isn't working, that's for
sure."
   Mr. Riethmiller's foreign speech is full of nonsense --
grammatically correct phrases that are fantastically
illogical. Blackboards hug tadpoles. Death itself cannot cure
cinnamon. These expressions, their vocabulary and
conjugations, are meant to be unforgettable. And they often
are. "Things like that really stick," says David Butz, a
medical products designer and Octaligual student. Barely
prompted, he rattles off "toothpaste-face, the bull" in
Portuguese, Russian and Italian.
   Even a lingual "dummkopf" like me stands a chance in
Octalingual and Quintalingual, Mr. Riethmiller insists. So in
a couple of visits to his evening classes, held in a
clapboard church near Harvard Yard, I go for it.
   The roundish Mr. Riethmiller, clad all in black, with
shoulder-length hair, mustache and beard of the same hue,
walks briskly into a 6:30 class at 7:03, looking like a
late-comer to a Hell's Angel's wake. The blackboard says
"thanks, mushroom" and "hello, ice" in seven different
languages. By 7:10, the word wizard gets his first laugh, and
soon we are his, 15 mouths on a tour of some very odd places:
   "Grazie, ciglia," says Mr. Riethmiller in Italian. We
repeat.
   "In Inglesi?" he asks.
   "Thanks, eyelash." And on:
   "Ciglia di lumaca." Snail's eyelash. "Ciglia di lumaca,
io?" Snail's eyelash, me? "Si, si, tu." Yes, yes, you. "Si,
si, tu. Tu e tuo Stazione Nord." Yes yes, you. You and your
North Station.
   A quick change to French and we board "le train". The
class repeats train-train-train-train in heavily accented
French for nearly a minute while Mr. Riethmiller goes
"woowoo" in the background. The train goes to where they
speak "Deutsch," where snail is "Schnecke," face is "Gesicht"
and each of us is called a "Schnecke-Gesicht."
   There's more to this method than tangled tongues. All the
things you hated about foreign language -- conjugation,
textbooks, tests and grades -- are gone. Verb tenses are all
mixed up at once, without progression, just the way people
speak.
   Mr. Riethmiller woos both ear and eye. His word-and-phrase
lists, copyrighted as "Lipscripts," employ assonance,
alliteration and onomatopoeia, as in the Italian word
"sussurare," for whispering. Moods shift as languages change.
Arabic and German are asserted. French sounds cute.
Portuguese, rendered in a Brazilian accent, sways like a
song.
   When Mr. Riethmiller wants to emphasize, which is nearly
always, he moves -- reaching high for squeaky words, pulling
phantom taffy for lengthy ones. Periodically, students must
rise and mimic his moves in what he calls the "Verbdance."
   The Octalingual students are highly complimentary of Mr.
Riethmiller, although they say he has danced lightly so far
in Russian and Japan. He also interrupts classes for what he
calls "brief four-second commercials" -- plugs for trips he
leads to teach Greek, Turkish and other languages on their
native soil.
   Even if we never get abroad, Mr. Riethmiller assures us
after an exhausting 90-minute class, what he teaches can be
used in nearby Harvard Square, home to many ethnic eateries.
He recommends Biscotti, an Italian cookie shop "which has
been bought by Hindi speakers who employ all Arabs, and you
can buy a little whatever, say "shukran" -- "thanks" in
Arabic -- and have a conversation.
   Head full of harems and hookahs, I hurry over to the shop
and order a cookie. The man behind the counter hands me
change and makes eye contact. Now]
   "Shukran," I say.
   "You're welcome," says the cookie man.
