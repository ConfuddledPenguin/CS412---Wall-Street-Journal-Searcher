   LONDON -- The project to tunnel across the English Channel
hit more choppy water, as nearly half its bankers balked at
increasing their lending.
   Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium building the
cross-channel link, said 91 members of its 210-bank syndicate
have so far declined to contribute to an extra two billion
pounds (US$3.75 billion) credit. The rejection, from banks
that had been expected to provide 31% of the borrowings,
raises new financial problems for the project and jeopardizes
its plan to sell more stock in October.

   London analysts and Eurotunnel officials, however,
expressed confidence that this latest snag will be resolved
-- as have numerous other technical, political and financial
obstacles to the complex project. "The fact that {the
finance} is a bit sticky and going rather slowly isn't
abnormal," said Eurotunnel Chief Executive Alastair Morton.
   The train tunnel, set to open in June 1993, will cut
transit time between London and Paris to three hours.
Technical snags and inflation have expanded its price tag,
estimated in 1987 at #4.9 billion to #7.66 billion.
   The latest snag came in increasing Eurotunnel's syndicated
credit line to #7 billion from #5 billion. The project's four
lead bankers -- Banque National de Paris, Credit Lyonnais,
Midland Bank PLC and National Westminster Bank PLC -- had
agreed in June to arrange the credit increase, to cover
higher construction-cost estimates. But since then, the four
lead banks have been unable to get all the other members of
the 210-bank syndicate to go along.
   "Most banks do have quite a lot {of lending} in this
project already," one participant in the talks said,
explaining the lenders' hesitation.
