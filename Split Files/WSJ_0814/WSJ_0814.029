   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said its
new credit card ranks eighth in the country, with revenue of
$750 million after 140 days in operation.
   In addition, the company and its partner, Universal Bank,
a unit of Columbus, Ga.-based Synovus Financial Corp., said
they have begun offering a gold MasterCard version of the
AT&amp;T Universal card, which is available as either a Visa card
or MasterCard.

   Since its introduction on March 26, the Universal card has
garnered 2.7 million accounts and 4.6 million cardholders,
according to AT&amp;T Universal Card Services Corp., the AT&amp;T
unit that issues the card.
   Moreover, AT&amp;T said more than 11 million long-distance
calls and purchases have been made using the card, for a
total of $750 million in transactions.
   AT&amp;T announced its millionth account on June 12, 78 days
after launching the card. Since then it has signed another
1.7 million accounts.
   That comes to about 27,000 cards per day. If this rate
holds, AT&amp;T by this time next year could have more than 12
million accounts, making it the second-largest credit card
issuer in the country. Moreover, annual revenue could top $3
billion. An AT&amp;T spokesman declined to make a prediction
about the card's future prospects.
   "Our continuing success in the marketplace is a sign that
consumers are delighted with the advantages offered by the
AT&amp;T Universal Card," said Paul G. Kahn, president of AT&amp;T
Universal, in a statement.
   His competitors aren't delighted, however. Several major
banks, including Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., have
filed lawsuits, challenging the legality of AT&amp;T's card.
   AT&amp;T is offering the Universal card free for life to
consumers who sign up in 1990 and use it at least once a
year. It is also offering discounts on long-distance calls
made with the card and assorted warranties and service
guarantees.
   AT&amp;T said it derived its ranking from figures provided by
Credit Card News, a Chicago-based newsletter.
