   TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's major
commercial banks, cut its prime lending rate to 14.25% from
14.75% effective today.
   It was the first cut in the bank's prime rate since
October 1987.

<TEXT>
   The prime rate cut followed a drop in the Bank of Canada's
bank rate last week to 13.34% from 13.42%. The central bank's
key bank rate has declined a total of 56 basis points in the
past seven weeks mainly because of an upswing in the Canadian
dollar. The bank rate is the levy which the central bank
charges on its loans to financial institutions.
   Canadian commercial banks last adjusted their prime rates
in April when the rate rose half a percentage point to
14.75%.
