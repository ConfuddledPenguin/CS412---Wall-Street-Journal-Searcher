   Cablevision Systems Corp. reported a second-quarter loss
of $67.7 million, or $3.09 a share, reflecting interest costs
and depreciation expense tied to acquisitions of cable-TV
systems the Woodbury, N.Y., company made last year.
   Operating cash flow-earnings from operations before
depreciation and amortization-advanced 15%, however, to $61.6
million.

   In February 1989, Cablevision acquired cable-TV systems
from National Amusements Inc.'s 84%-owned Viacom Inc.
subsidiary. And last December, the company acquired certain
systems from a subsidiary of Times Mirror Co.
   The loss compares with net income of $24.1 million, or 99
cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue climbed
13% to $141.2 million from $125.4 million.
