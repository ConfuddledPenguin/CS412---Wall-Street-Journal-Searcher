   MINNEAPOLIS -- Cray Research Inc. said Exxon Corp. ordered
a Cray Y-MP8 computer system valued at about $15 million.
   The system, to replace two existing Cray supercomputers,
is to be installed in the fourth quarter at the New
York-based oil company's technical computing center in
Houston. It will be the first Cray Y-MP8 supercomputer used
in the petroleum industry, said Cray, which makes
large-scale, high-speed computers.
