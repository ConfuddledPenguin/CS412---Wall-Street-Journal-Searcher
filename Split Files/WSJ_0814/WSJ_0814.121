   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's inspector general
charged 17 former and current Consolidated Edison Co.
employees with bribery and extortion involving cash from Con
Ed customers, electrical contractors and others.
   The inspector general's office of labor racketeering filed
criminal complaints in federal and state courts in New York.
The complaints alleged that the Con Ed employees extorted
cash in return for, among other things, overlooking safety
hazards such as natural gas leaks, allowing illegal gas and
electrical hookups to go unreported, and expediting the
providing of gas or electrical service.

   The investigation is part of a probe by the
labor-racketeering office into corruption in the New York
construction industry, said Stephen Cossu, the office's New
York agent-in-charge.
   Complaints were filed in federal district court in
Brooklyn charging extortion and fraud against seven persons
of Con Ed's Bedford/Bushwick branch, including two managers.
   Ten people including a supervisor were charged in state
court with extortion and bribery, including allowing illegal
hookups for Manhattan customers, at a restaurant, auto repair
shop, laundromat and an apartment building, and permitting
delays in repairs of gas leaks at an apartment building and a
restaurant.
