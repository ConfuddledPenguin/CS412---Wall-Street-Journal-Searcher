   After seasonal adjustment, input prices rose 0.6% in July
from June and were down 1.1% from July 1989. This compares
with June's 1.4% monthly fall and 2.4% yearly fall. The
statistical office said it provided a seasonally adjusted
index for input prices as they are more subject to seasonal
fluctuations than output prices.
   After seasonal adjustment, the index of input prices was
at 102.9 in July, up from 102.3 in June and down from 104.0
in July 1989.
