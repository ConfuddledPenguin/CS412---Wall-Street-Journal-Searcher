   I find myself compelled to express my considerable
dissatisfaction and concern regarding your July 27 page-one
article on pornography defendants. You imply that
pornographers are being treated unfairly by the judicial
system by being subject to multiple prosecutions. You suggest
that merely because Philip Harvey's local community has not
found his pornographic materials objectionable, that Mr.
Harvey should be allowed to distribute these materials
anywhere he pleases without regard to community values. I
submit to you that Mr. Harvey in choosing to peddle his
materials throughout the country should be responsible to the
values of communities in which he expects to do business.
   You further suggest that the Justice Department and
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh have, as a result of
implied political ambitions, begun prosecuting pornographers
to gain conservative political advantage.

   I believe rather that his putting child pornographers
behind bars should bring little protest inasmuch as Mr.
Thornburgh and the Justice Department are enforcing the laws
established by the judicial systems within this country.
Furthermore, enforcement of current obscenity and pornography
laws should not be weakened by past inaction to enforce such
laws. I expect the Justice Department to enforce these laws
and commend Mr. Thornburgh and former Attorney General Edwin
Meese for their courageous actions to uphold the law and
defend the child victims of such pornographic materials.

   The questions you raised illustrate the problem with
trying to squelch free expression, for whatever motive, in a
free society.
   Even if one can find a standard to prove which material
"appeals to prurient interests, depicts sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way and lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value" (a task that is daunting
enough), one question still remains: Should that material be
illegal? If obscenity can be made illegal, why not blasphemy,
atheism, communism or any number of things that most people
find offensive?
   The bottom line is this: Either we believe in free speech
or we don't. The Constitution doesn't simply say that "the
majority rules." On the contrary, it is an anti-majoritarian
document that in many cases is there to protect the minority
from the majority. In my opinion, that should include the
minority that gets its jollies from watching "Prisoner of
Paradise."
   So long as pornographers don't engage in child or animal
abuse, and so long as everyone involved, including the
viewer, is a consenting adult, then I think the Justice
Department has bigger fish to fry.

   Your article on obscenity prosecutions and the perils of
double jeopardy lacked a certain historical perspective.
Venue shopping on the part of overzealous prosecutors is
nothing new: I was the victim of one such case of judicial
fraud when a federal indictment was handed down against me in
1974, in Wichita, Kan.
   My newspaper specializes in sexual satire, and we found we
had sold four subscriptions to the whole of Kansas -- all
four to U.S. postal inspectors. Even though the bulk of my
sales were to New York City and environs, I had to undergo
the egregious expense of defending myself in a courtroom a
thousand miles distant from my home base.
   In general, the current hysteria over censorship of art
and music holds a savage amusement for those of us who've
been on the front lines of First Amendment battles. The
censorship of pornography creates a climate in which the
guardians of social purity can go on to bigger bonfires.
   The First Amendment must be inclusive, plenary and immune
for it to have any meaning at all. I have long decried the
media's silence on the suppression of adult entertainment. To
paraphrase that old quote about the Holocaust, no one in the
media objected when they came for the pornographers, because
no one in the media published porn. No one objected when they
came for the rappers, because they weren't rappers. No one
objected to the silencing of the performance artists,
because, after all, they didn't do performance art. By the
time the censors come for The Wall Street Journal, the New
York Times, Time or Newsweek, there just may be no one left
to object.
