   NEW YORK -- A power outage in lower Manhattan all but
ended foreign-exchange dealings by 2 p.m. EDT, truncating a
session investors had been using to sell dollars and yen for
European currencies.
   The electrical shutdown, caused by a transformer fire near
the Brooklyn Bridge, left many New York trading rooms without
computers or telephones. Many offices able to switch to
emergency power were left without the services of electronic
dealing and quoting systems.

   Electricity hadn't been restored to lower Manhattan by the
end of the working day.
   Ian Foakes, foreign-exchange manager for PaineWebber
International in New York, said the only parallel for Monday
that he remembers occurred in 1985 when New York currency
trading was halted by an approaching tornado.
   New York trading rooms that were unaffected technically by
the outage, and those elsewhere in North America, were
generally unable to continue working without their
counterparts or the services of the New York broker network.
   "When they remove the other team from the field, you have
no one to bat against," Mr. Foakes said. He said that even
though the PaineWebber offices in midtown Manhattan never
lost their dealing capabilities, his traders generally
refrained from entering the extremely thin late-afternoon
market.
   "If you have no counterparties, you have no way to get
out" if, for example, fighting started in the smoldering
Middle East, Mr. Foakes said.
   Even before the strange end to the North American trading
session, a lack of noise from the armies facing each other on
the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia frontier had sapped foreign-exchange
activity. U.S. dealers outside of New York quipped that
dealings had been so sparse they didn't notice the difference
at first when New York went black.
   In fact, most signs from the Mideast suggested the
military showdown is cooling down or is at least not
worsening.
   Dollar dealers were greeted in the morning by a picture on
the front page of the Financial Times in which President Bush
was directing the crisis from the seat of his golf cart at
his Maine vacation home.
   The weekend offer by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to pull
out of Kuwait if Israel leaves its occupied territories,
though rejected by the U.S. and other nations, was seen as an
indication that the leader would like a peaceful, face-saving
solution to the standoff.
   As a result, after a 1 1/2 weeks of trading the dollar to
exhaustion, currency dealers were free to concentrate on
non-dollar cross-trading strategies. "Traders have gotten
burned out trying to follow the dollar," said Judy
Rubenstein, a Los Angeles vice president with Bank of
America.
   The day's most interesting activity involved selling
Japanese yen for European currencies led by the Swiss franc,
she said.
   The cross-dealings were a natural outgrowth of a market
determined to stay square, neither oversold nor overbought,
on the dollar until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved,
added Martin L. McNulty, a vice president in New York for
Lloyds Bank.
   The dollar was hurt severely by the interest in its
European counterparts and even failed to benefit from the
yen's weakness. About the time trading was forced to stop in
New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5765 marks, down from
1.5905 marks late Friday in New York. Sterling was trading at
$1.8830, up from $1.8740 late Friday.
   The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 150.40 yen,
down from 150.45 yen in New York late Friday.
   Before trading shut down, the dollar was trading at 1.3165
Swiss francs, down from 1.3375 francs late Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 149.95 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 150.65 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5775
marks; in Tokyo Monday, it closed at 1.5781 marks.
   Traders said that while the dollar may still be a safe
haven during times of extreme global disruption, the nervous
buying caused by the present extended period of tension is
flowing to gold and the Swiss franc, both age-old harbors.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, in late trading
before the power outage gold for current delivery was $405.20
an ounce, up $8.20.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$402.75 an ounce.
