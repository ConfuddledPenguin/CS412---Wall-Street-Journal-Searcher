   NEW YORK -- Just when investors didn't need more bad news,
there is further reason for concern about the earnings
outlook at America's biggest companies.
   On the surface, corporate profits swelled for most of
1980s. But a startling amount of the increase didn't come
from operating factors such as strong sales or profit margins
-- it came from a decline in pension expense.

   "A hidden source of past profit growth" is how Kidder
Peabody describes the reduction in pension expense. In a
study, Kidder shows how the pension factor has been
especially significant for America's largest companies. And
now, in an important turnabout, pension expenses now aren't
dropping any longer. Kidder says that in the 1990s, they
could well become a hidden drag on corporate earnings.
   "This trend in lower pension expense has reversed," says
the study by George Boyd, director of quantitative research,
and Easton Ragsdale, a Kidder vice president and analyst.
Pension costs "will no longer be a major source of future
earnings growth and stock price support -- buyers beware."
   The Kidder analysts argue, in short, that pension expense
can't be held down forever by the one-time punches of the
80s, which included a surging stock market and vast
work-force cuts by companies.
   From 1982 to 1989, shrinkage in pension expense accounted
for 12% of the rise in pretax profit of the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 companies. For the largest 100 companies (in terms of
market value), the contribution was an even bigger 17% of
growth in earnings before taxes. And for the top 25
corporations, the pension-cost decline accounted for a
startling 36% of pretax profit growth.
   Stated differently, S&amp;P pretax earnings grew at a 7.8%
compound annual clip from 1982 to 1989. But without the
effects of reduced pension costs, the annual growth rate was
a smaller 6.1%.
   Here again, the effect is most pronounced with the 25
largest companies. For them, pretax earnings grew at an
annual rate of 4.3%. But pre-pension or "normal" earnings
grew at a rate of only 2.5%.
   Kidder says the companies that have benefited most from
lower pension costs are "heavily weighted toward large,
old-line manufacturing companies, airlines, and defense, all
of which have major work forces." Among the greatest
beneficiaries were Pan Am, Bethlehem Steel and Lockheed.
   "Such companies tend to have the biggest pension plans,"
Kidder explains. And in the 1980s, operating profit growth in
manufacturing generally lagged behind that of consumer
companies.
   On the other hand, Kidder says, companies that benefited
least include those in finance, consumer goods and
technology, "which tend to be less labor-intensive" and less
unionized. Among the companies least affected: Ralston Purina
and Citicorp.
   Overall, pension expenses of the S&amp;P 500 companies plunged
by 51%, to $13.2 billion in 1988 from $26.7 billion in 1982.
And as a percentage of pretax earnings, pension costs shrank
to 5% from 18%.
   However, the long slide was reversed in 1989. Pension
costs for the year edged up to $14.4 billion, or 6% of pretax
profits.
   Thus, the effect of lowered pension costs is especially
great if an investor looks only at the 1982-88 period -- the
years before pension costs turned upward. In that span,
pretax earnings of the 25 largest public companies rose by a
total of $17.32 billion. And $7.99 billion of the increase --
a staggering 46% -- is attributable to reduced pension costs.
   Why did pension costs fall so sharply and so
systematically? A major reason was the long bull market. As
the stock market surged for most of the 1980s, pension
portfolios became "overfunded," meaning they were fatter than
needed to meet estimated future claims.
   "As the market was going up, it was easier for companies
to put less money in," Mr. Ragsdale says. In addition, he
says, many companies were cutting back employment levels. At
the same time, wage inflation was moderating (pension benefit
levels often are tied to wage rates.)
   But it's highly unlikely that pension costs will resume
their slide. "They had gotten to a very low level," Mr.
Ragsdale says. "They can't go to zero."
   In fact, several trends suggest they could rise. "It's
unlikely that the enormous stock market returns {of the
1980s} will be repeated in the '90s," Mr. Boyd says. And a
protracted bear market might require companies to cough up
more.
   In addition, wage inflation is creeping back. Nationwide,
the annual rate of wage and salary increases peaked at 7.2%
in the second quarter of 1982. It hit bottom in 1987, at
3.2%, and since then has risen steadily, to a 4.7% rate in
the second quarter of 1990.
   Moreover, in the next few years the overall benefits
burden on companies could grow considerably heavier. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to approve a
new rule this year that would require companies to treat
post-retirement health benefits similar to the way pensions
are treated.
   Under the proposed change, contributions that are made to
fund future retiree health payments would flow through
corporate income statements and be charged against corporate
earnings. This would add a new and sizable expense.
   The change isn't expected to be mandatory until 1993,
though some companies may start switching before then.
   "This could have a negative impact on profits in the
1990s," Mr. Ragsdale says. "Companies will have to make
significant yearly contributions to fund future retiree
health benefits."
   In many ways, the 1980s drop in pension costs resembles
the long slide in oil prices, which also acted as a pep pill
to corporate earnings. And, like the recent spike in oil
prices, the trend in pension costs is changing at an
inauspicious moment -- a period, Kidder notes, of "slow
economic growth and severe profit-margin pressure."
