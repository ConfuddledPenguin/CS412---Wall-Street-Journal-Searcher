   Tokyo stocks nosedived in shallow, holiday trading on
consistent arbitrage selling pressure.
   The Nikkei Index closed with its fourth-argest single
daily loss in terms of percentage, and the seventh-largest
plunge in terms of points.

   In London, share prices ended lower, but the quiet start
to the week found the market retracing half its losses by the
close to finish near intraday highs.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues plunged 1153.12 points
to 26176.43. Volume on the first section was estimated at 250
million shares, down from 317.3 million shares Friday.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 934 to 34, while 70 issues were
unchanged.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was at
26100.17, off 76.26.
   Monday's Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in
the first section plummeted 63.84 points, or 3.10%, to
1993.04. The close on the Topix was the first time it had
been below 2000 points since February 1988.
   The second section index plunged 123.75 points, or 3.01%,
to 3988.36. Volume in the section was estimated at seven
million shares, down from 11.3 million shares Friday.
   The market was thin because of this week's traditional
Japanese "O-Bon" festival season, with fund managers and
institutions on vacation, traders said. But with conventional
trading operations scarce, arbitrage activity was rampant.
   Prices tumbled from the opening on index-linked selling
mostly by arbitragers, falling to an intraday low of 25913.76
points and not showing a turnaround until late afternoon. At
that, the Nikkei Index recovered only about 260 points by the
close.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, the Nikkei Index has
fallen 4661.56 points, or 15.12%. The repeated declines, with
the exception of a strong rebound Wednesday, have steadily
chipped away at buying sentiment.
   But as the index broke through downside support at 26000
points Monday afternoon, marking an intraday low for the
year, participants were hit by a new level of frustration,
traders said.
   "We are now living in a painfully high interest rate
environment . . . and the level where the market operates
will have to adjust to that," said Paul Muller, manager of
international sales at Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd. "It's
no longer a liquidity-driven, lower interest rate market."
   Traders said that technical chart support points to 24500
as key for the Nikkei Index.
   Combined with anxieties about the conflict in the Persian
Gulf, a weaker yen, a high balance of margin positions and
higher interest rates, the market is further distressed by
the uncertainty of where prices will ultimately bottom.
   "The market is really sick right now," said Minami Omura,
a broker at PaineWebber Inc. "I can't read the charts; I
can't even see the supporting line."
   Ms. Omura said some of her clients say that they'd like to
buy because shares have become so much cheaper, but can't
because they can't know how much lower prices will fall.
   Although Big Four and top foreign brokerage traders alike
said that they're bottom-fishing for growth and quality
stocks, they added that they intend to dump those shares at
the first sign of strength.
   The market has during previous crashes managed to recover
on support from bargain hunters, particularly individuals,
but with the likelihood that interest rates will remain high,
the prospects for buying have been severely cramped, traders
said.
   "Even if the situation {in the Persian Gulf} should
stabilize, it's unclear what to buy," one trader at a U.S.
firm said.
   Bitten twice already from buying on margin after the last
two mini-crashes, when the Nikkei fell to 1,569.10 points to
33,321.87 points Feb. 26 and when it lost 1,978.38 points to
28,002.07 points April 2, individuals aren't willing to try
again, traders said.
   Those investors who bought after the February plunge have
to settle margin positions by the end of August, which in a
declining market will only increase downward pressure,
traders said.
   And the Nikkei has retreated 21.44% since the February
plunge.
   Similarly, institutions have begun to reduce their cash
positions to block losses, PaineWebber's Omura said, but then
have found that they can't always do so because volume is too
thin to execute the transaction.
   Institutions are somewhat better off than individuals,
however, because they have enough cash to hedge their
positions by selling futures, traders said.
   Other hedging opportunities include buying Topix shares,
seen as outperforming Nikkei issues, after index-linked
selling of Nikkei cash positions, although traders noted that
there's not too much benefit with the Topix declining.
   Arbitrage was one of the only employable trading
instruments Monday, as futures were trading consistently at a
discount to the cash indexes until late in the day. Selling
pressure kept futures from rising on the arbitrage activity,
with futures closing Monday at stop-lows, traders said.
   Arbitrage selling against the Nikkei 225 index and Topix
was also used with options trading Monday.
   Traders said that until a conclusion is in sight for the
Middle East conflict, there's always the potential that oil
supplies will be cut, justifying soaring oil prices and
underlying a prolonged financial crisis.
   Shares were down across the board, with especially poor
performances by high-technology, steel and oil shares.
   Sony closed at 7,730 down 80 yen, Kyocera lost 220 yen to
7,830 yen and Fanuc fell 350 yen to 6,150 yen.
   Nippon Oil Co. finished 70 yen lower at 1,330 yen, while
Showa Shell also lost 70 yen to 1,230 yen.
   Kawasaki Steel lost 12 yen to 489 yen.
   Heavy industry companies were also lower. Kawasaki Heavy
lost 23 yen.
   In London, a lack of fresh developments in the Middle East
and only modest losses at the start of trading in New York
helped London traders regain some of their nerve late in the
day.
   "There hasn't actually been that much selling," noted the
head of trading at a major London brokerage. "London was
never that nasty" despite the fears generated by the buildup
of U.S. military forces in Saudi Arabia over the weekend and
Tokyo's near-record fall earlier Monday.
   Some traders were even beginning to sense the market may
be about to bottom out from its mid-summer fall. Compared
with the U.S. market in particular, said one U.K. broker,
London shares are "quite good value, but you've got to be
prepared" for a further thrashing in case of a fullfledged
war in the Middle East.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was off
14.3 points at 2219.5, only a point lower than the day's high
reached as the market opened. The low came just ahead of the
New York opening, when the FT-SE 100 was off 27.2 points.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 10.8 points to
1732.2. Volume was a thin 294 million shares.
   August holidays combined with the nervousness over the
Middle East to leave the market thinly traded. Institutional
investors, noted one dealer, "are sitting on their hands" for
fear of getting caught out should the market grow more
agitated by developments in Kuwait.
   Yet within the quiet, traders noted a willingness in some
quarters to pick up blue chip shares in large blocks. "If you
offer them garbage, they won't take it," said one equity
salesman. "But a quality line of stock you can place with
consummate ease."
   Among the shares benefiting from the interest in cheap
blue chips was ICI, which rose 2 pence to 943 pence.
   Otherwise, dealers said the day was largely featureless.
U.K. economic indicators, including a 1% rise in retail sales
in July from June, added to the market's early losses. But
dealers said that investors were largely ignoring local
economic data in their watch for news from the Middle East.
Even the July retail price index, due Friday, is likely to be
ignored because it won't reflect the jump in oil prices seen
since the beginning of the month, one trader said.
   Among the few corporate developments, Polly Peck
International rose 24 pence to 417 pence after its chairman
said he was considering making an offer for the group. The
stock had traded as high as 450 pence early in the day.
   Eurotunnel, which acknowledged a slower-than-expected
syndication of a #2 billion credit package, dropped to 475
pence from 500 pence.
   Carlton Communications, trounced late last week on fears
of still more disappointment in earnings, recovered to gain
20 points to 339 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Frankfurt, Zurich,
Brussels, Amsteram, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan. South
African gold stocks closed sharply higher.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei, Manila, Wellington, Seoul.
