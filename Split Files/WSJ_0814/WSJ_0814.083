   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission,
clearing the way for stiff anti-dumping duties to be imposed
on imports of Mexican cement, ruled that the imports are
injuring U.S. producers.
   Following the ruling, Cemex S.A., Mexico's largest cement
producer, announced its intention to "phase out" about half
of its annual shipments of 3.6 million metric tons to the
U.S. At the same time, Cemex said it is considering whether
to appeal the ITC decision.

   The ITC's finding gives force to the Commerce Department's
earlier determination that duties should be imposed on the
imports to offset their allegedly unfair price advantage over
domestic products. The duties are 57.96% for Cemex, 53.26%
for Apasco S.A. de C.V., 3.69% for Cementos Hidalgo S.C.I.
and 57.65% for all other Mexican shipments. Those figures
represent the department's estimate of the extent to which
the imports are being "dumped" in the U.S. -- that is, sold
at prices below production costs or their home-market price.
   The duties would cut sharply into Cemex's normal U.S.
sales since they will add $17 a ton to the price of the
Mexican cement, currently about $30 a ton. The imports to be
affected are gray portland cement, which is widely used in
construction, and clinker, an intermediate material used in
finished cement.
   Clarence Comer, president of Houston-based Southdown Inc.,
hailed the ITC decision as an "important victory" for cement
producers in the U.S. South and Southwest. "It will enable
the industry to expand and modernize, creating jobs and other
economic benefits for this country," he said. Southdown led a
group of producers in Florida, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico
that petitioned for relief.
   Jose Trevino, Cemex's chief international officer, argued
that the ITC decision runs counter to moves by the North
American governments to move toward freer trade. "It is in
the interest of all the peoples of Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico that our contiguous economies be mutually supporting,"
he said in a statement.
   But U.S. officials say anti-dumping investigations are
designed to correct alleged unfair trading practices and
don't necessarily hamper moves toward free-trade relations
between countries.
   Mr. Trevino said Cemex won't be hurt seriously by the
reduction in shipments to the U.S. because rising
construction activity in Mexico could pick up the slack.
Cemex describes itself as the world's fourth-largest cement
producer, with total assets of $2.9 billion.
   The Mexican company said it may challenge the ITC's ruling
before the Court of International Trade, the New York
tribunal authorized to review such decisions.
   U.S. cement-makers claim that imports now account for 22%
of the 90 million tons in annual U.S. cement consumption. The
companies that filed the anti-dumping petition said dumped
imports have depressed cement prices here and caused U.S.
investors to abandon the industry.
   The Commerce Department estimated last year's shipments of
Mexican cement and clinker at more than $111 million.
