   NEW YORK -- Mobil Corp. said it agreed to purchase the
stake it doesn't already own in two refineries and a network
of gasoline stations in Australia from Exxon Corp.
   Neither Exxon nor Mobil would disclose the transaction's
value, but industry officials put it at about $400 million.

   The purchase includes about 300 gasoline stations and 90
fuel truck depots. Mobil already owns 700 gasoline stations
there.
   In addition, the acquisition includes Exxon's 35% share of
a joint-venture company currently operated by both companies.
The company, Petroleum Refineries Proprietary Ltd., runs two
refineries. One, located in Altona, processes 120,000 barrels
a day of crude oil. The other refinery, in Adelaide, handles
65,000 barrels of oil daily.
   Mobil has been attempting to increase its presence in
Australia and Asia, where the use of oil has increased
sharply in recent years. "The acquisition of these assets
will advance our strategy of increasing strength in the
world's fastest-growing market for petroleum products," said
Allen Murray, Mobil chairman.
   The acquisition, expected to be completed by year end,
will boost Mobil to a tie with British Petroleum Co. as the
second-largest marketer of gasoline in Australia. It will be
providing service to 20% of Australia's motorists. Mobil is
currently ranked fourth, serving 14% of the populace.
