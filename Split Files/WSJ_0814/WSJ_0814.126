   MINNEAPOLIS -- Cray Research Inc. said it agreed in
principle to settle a 1989 shareholder lawsuit for $700,000.
   Cray said three separate suits, which claimed the company
had failed to make public certain financial information and
details about future business prospects in 1989, were
consolidated into a single action in Minneapolis federal
court last fall.

   In a letter to employees yesterday, Cray contended that
the suit is without merit. The company said it agreed to
settle the matter to save time and expense. Cray added that
the agreement is subject to certain contingencies, including
court approval.
