   INDIANAPOLIS -- In Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s rabbit warren of
research laboratories, scientists wield mostly medieval tools
-- from test tubes and flasks to beakers and diagrams -- in
their quest for new drugs.
   But purring away at the center of it all is a late 20th
century anomaly: a $12 million supercomputer.

   In a gamble that startled its conservative industry, the
No. 4 U.S. drug maker recently became the first
pharmaceutical company to install its own supercomputer -- a
Cray-2, one of the most powerful machines made by Cray
Research Inc., the leading supercomputer maker.
   The machine can't discover drugs, nor does it guarantee
that Lilly's R&amp;D record will improve. But it does add to
Lilly scientists' bag of tricks a three-ton tool of
unprecedented power, amplifying their ability to experiment
with molecular images and sift through endless new-drug
candidates.
   Lilly's purchase has also helped touch off an industrywide
new-hardware race. Industry leader Merck &amp; Co. is tapping
supercomputer-like IBM equipment in a pact with International
Business Machines Corp. Monsanto Co. leased a supercomputer,
and Abbott Laboratories, Schering-Plough Corp. and others
have upgraded their computer capabilities as well.
   The wave of investment has raised hopes of streamlining
the riskiest and most expensive research process in U.S.
industry: the search for breakthrough drugs. Scientists have
been studying images of molecules on computer screens for
more than a decade, but the latest trend in computer
equipment is carrying them far beyond the tinkering of the
past. For the first time, computers and workstations are
powerful and sophisticated enough to grapple with models of
the large, complex human proteins and enzymes involved in
today's cutting-edge drug research.
   Instead of just presenting fixed visual models, the new
technology enables scientists to manipulate images of big
molecules and watch them interact with other substances in
human-like environments. It allows researchers to replace
slow, near-random laboratory testing of hundreds of
substances with more rapid theoretical screening.
   "Three years ago, there wasn't enough computational power
or enough knowledge to make this {new technology} useful,"
says Charles T. Casale, president of Aberdeen Group, a
Boston-based computer consulting and research group. Now "the
question is, `Who is going to get there first with a
significant breakthrough?'"
   The new technology also holds out the hope of streamlining
human tests of experimental compounds. By helping researchers
analyze test data for a wider range of doses on more patient
groups, for example, computers could help identify safer,
potentially less toxic doses.
   For the first time, some companies are even giving
computers partial credit for discoveries. Schering-Plough
cites computer techniques in the development of a
schizophrenia drug now being tested on humans. Novo Nordisk
A/S says computers helped speed up discovery of an insulin
product, also in human trials.
   Some believe computer-assisted design will have as big an
impact on pharmaceutical research as it did on the auto, oil
and aerospace industries in the 1970s. "Over the next
decade," says Larry L. Smarr, director of the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
Illinois, "supercomputer simulation will become one of the
pillars of research in pharmaceuticals."
   Applying computers to the arcane art of drug research is a
gamble. Unlike car fenders and aerospace parts, new drugs
can't be engineered based on existing knowledge. Scientific
theory is lacking, and the molecules involved are too
complex. Many have as many as 5,000 atoms and look like fuzzy
balls when reproduced on screen. Designing a drug from
scratch by computer would require more mathematical knowledge
and computational power than exists today.
   Instead, scientists must apply a combination of skill,
experience, intuition and sheer luck to identify a potential
drug for a particular disease. The industry screens an
estimated 10,000 compounds for every one that reaches the
market, a process that typically takes 10 to 12 years and
costs more than $100 million. The odds of success are so low
that oil wildcatters have a "sure thing" by comparison, Mr.
Casale says.
   That hasn't stopped some computer vendors from making
outrageous claims for their offerings. One European software
vendor even promised its product could design drugs from
start to finish.
   For their part, drug makers are desperate to speed up the
discovery process. Although R&amp;D spending is soaring, generic
products are slashing the profitable life of brand-name
drugs. Rising international competition is holding down drug
prices and eroding U.S. companies' share of the world market.
To sustain their current profitability, drug makers must
improve R&amp;D returns.
   No one is betting bigger on new computer technology to win
that race than Lilly. With its R&amp;D spending rising at a rate
of 16% to 18% a year, Lilly has scored some major successes,
fielding the fast-selling new antidepressant Prozac and
diversifying its product line away from antibiotics.
Nevertheless, "they don't have the best lineup of products
over the next one or two years," says Mary Ellen McCarthy, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   With no way to project the bottom-line impact of new
computer technology, the Cray purchase "boils down to a leap
of faith -- a gamble," admits Mel Perelman, a Lilly vice
president and president of Lilly Research Laboratories.
   Whatever the outcome, there are no signs of doubt in
Lilly's laboratories. Scientists are already using the
supercomputer to study insulin compounds and potential cures
for AIDS and Alzheimer's disease, among other things.
Voluntary use of the new machine in the first few weeks after
its late-May installation rose far faster than expected. "It
has surprised us continually," says John S. Wold, executive
director of Lilly Research Laboratories.
   Desktop terminals all over Lilly's sprawling headquarters
are hooked up to the Cray. More than 40 Lilly scientists have
taken supercomputer training at the University of Illinois's
National Center for Supercomputer Applications. Lilly has
even turned the machine -- a red-and-black cylinder about the
size of an airline ticket counter -- into a tourist
attraction, ensconcing it behind a panel of smoked glass in a
video-equipped visitors' gallery.
   For researchers like James Wikel, a senior chemist, the
machine is a powerful aid to the imagination. Once restricted
to clumsy ball-and-stick models of molecules of the kind
common in chemistry classrooms, he is beginning to be able to
construct a big enzyme on his screen, study the relevant
"receptor" site, and test its reaction to various drug
candidates.
   On a computer screen in one of Lilly's modeling labs, he
shows a visitor a rotating, multi-hued image of a complex
human enzyme. Buried within its honeycomb-like maze of atoms
are clues to the enzyme's biological activity that could
yield insights into ways to block the AIDS virus.
   Whether he is jogging, relaxing at home or commuting to
work, the chemist carries such molecular images with him. All
the while, consciously or unconsciously, his mind seeks the
new scientific insights of which breakthrough drugs are born.
   Without the computer, "I would have to start with
something like this," Mr. Wikel says, blackening the screen
by switching off his terminal. Now, he says, "I can
essentially walk all the way around {the molecule} as if it
were a table in the middle of the room, to get a view from
all angles."
   The images "will spring forth . . . when you're not
thinking about it consciously," Mr. Wikel says. "Suddenly,
something will click and you'll say, `Aha] That's what I was
looking for.'" That "aha factor" -- the "eureka principle,"
as Roger G. Harrison, Lilly's director of organic and
physical chemistry research, calls it -- is the key to
breakthroughs.
   Lilly executives aren't making any promises about the new
technology. Indeed, the science of new-drug research is
widely seen as a mature field, "with the `easy' discoveries
well in the past and the easy-to-cure diseases already
cured," Mr. Casale wrote in a report on the new technology.
"New discoveries cost more, take longer and typically are
accompanied by side effects often undiscovered for years."
   Nevertheless, Lilly scientists are confident that "we're
closer and closer to dealing with these uncertainties than we
ever have been," says Riaz Abdulla, Lilly's head of
supercomputer applications.
   The supercomputer "puts us in a better competitive
position to really come up with the compounds of the future,"
Mr. Harrison adds. "Our great discoveries are yet to come."
