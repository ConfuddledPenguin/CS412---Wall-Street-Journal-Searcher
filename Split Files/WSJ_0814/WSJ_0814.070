   CONCORD, Mass. -- Plans to build a controversial
condominium project near Walden Pond, made famous by author
Henry David Thoreau, have been scrapped.
   The Trust for Public Land, a conservation group, agreed to
purchase for $3.5 million about 25 acres on which the
139-unit project was to have been built. The project was to
have included 42 low-income units.

   "This is a major victory for us," said Thomas Blanding, a
Thoreau scholar and president of the Thoreau Country
Conservation Alliance, a development opponent. "Walden is the
symbol of a balanced relationship between man and nature."
The dispute over the project was the subject of a page one
article in the Journal.
   The trust also promised state officials to find a suitable
alternative site for low-income housing within a year, said
Kathi Anderson, director of Walden Woods Project, a
conservation effort. Failing that, the group will have to
build low-income housing on part of the 25 acres it purchased
yesterday.
   The development project drew attention after a group of
about 50 musicians and actors, including Don Henley, Bonnie
Raitt and Carrie Fisher, backed the anti-development effort.
The group banded together to raise about $425,000, but
critics charged that the protest was a ruse by wealthy
Concordians to keep out the poor.
