   TOKYO -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's decision to
postpone a Middle East trip underscores Japan's difficulties
in defining a role it can play in the current crisis.
   The trip was put off so Mr. Kaifu's government can devise
"concrete measures for the Japanese contribution" to
resolving the crisis, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji
Sakamoto. Mr. Kaifu was scheduled to leave Wednesday on a
long-scheduled goodwill mission to Turkey, Saudi Arabia,
Oman, Jordan and Egypt. The government now hopes to
reschedule the trip for early October.

   Mr. Kaifu's advisers felt it would be a mistake to proceed
with the visit if all Mr. Kaifu could take with him were
words of support for the international effort to contain
Iraq. "We feel it would be better for Mr. Kaifu to visit
these countries with the substantial means to contribute
peace and stability to the region," said Makoto Watanabe, the
Foreign Ministry's director general in charge of the Middle
East.
   Government officials declined to comment on specific
possible measures Japan might take, but Japanese academics
and other private citizens had no shortage of ideas, from
dispatching mine sweepers to increasing financial support for
U.S. forces in Japan to sending teams of medics.
   Few nations have more at stake in the Middle East crisis
than Japan, with its heavy dependence on imported oil. But
few nations have more deeply rooted inhibitions against
projecting military power abroad than Japan, with its
post-World War II "peace constitution." As countries like
Canada and Australia dispatch ships to the area, many
Japanese say Japan must sit on the sidelines.
   "This is a war situation," said Tetsuya Kataoka, a
Japanese political scientist at the Hoover Institution in
Palo Alto, Calif. "I don't see what the Japanese government
can do in a war situation."
   Japan has mine sweepers, and Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone considered sending them to the Persian Gulf during a
previous crisis there in the 1980s. Seizaburo Sato, a
Nakasone advisor, doesn't think Japan should send ships or
aircraft with attacking capabilities to the Middle East, but
he does think it should be prepared, if developments in the
region seem to warrant it, to make "some military
contribution." And a mine sweeper, he notes, is "not an
attacking vessel."
   But sending mine sweepers would be tremendously
controversial in Japan. It might be better, Mr. Sato mused,
for Japan to contribute by increasing host-nation support for
U.S. forces stationed in Japan, thus freeing up more U.S.
resources for the Middle East effort. Mr. Sato also thinks
Japan should give more foreign aid to countries in the region
that support the anti-Iraq effort, such as Egypt and Turkey.
   But even increased host-nation support and aid to the
Middle East would not appeal to some Japanese. Mr. Kataoka,
for example, said he would be "offended" if the U.S. in
effect said, "All right, we'll play the policeman for you and
apportion what amount to taxes." That, said Mr. Kataoka,
would spark "a major controversy in Japan." As for increased
foreign aid, he says: "I don't see what money can buy in the
Middle East."
   No government official has voiced public support for
measures like those Mr. Sato advocates. Asked what role Japan
should play in the crisis, a Foreign Ministry official said
one of the most important things Japan can do is not waver on
the steps it has already taken, which include criticizing
Iraq and imposing economic sanctions. It goes without saying
that the government would be extremely embarrassed if
Japanese companies were discovered sneaking in oil from Iraq
or shipping it vital supplies.
   Although Japan lagged behind both the U.S. and Western
Europe in adopting sanctions, it moved relatively quickly by
its own cautious standards. It announced its decision a day
before the United Nations Security Council voted to impose
international sanctions. A Western diplomat argues that "the
fact that they came out so strongly helped get support for
the Security Council resolution. Instead of following the
consensus, they helped to shape it."
   But that was nine days ago and since then Japan's
government has seemed increasingly cautious. It dithered for
days over whether to go ahead with Mr. Kaifu's trip to the
Middle East, scheduled to begin Wednesday. Meanwhile, a
Foreign Ministry spokeman managed, probably unintentionally,
to put a grudging cast on Japan's sanctions by stressing to
foreign reporters what a "sacrifice" they amounted to -- even
as private economists and other government agencies boasted
that the country's strong economy wouldn't suffer much from
them.
   Impatient with this caution, some Japanese have stopped
feeling satisfied with what their country has done and have
started to ask, as one Diet member's aide puts it, "Is this
enough?" Kazuo Aichi, a Liberal Democrat Party Diet member
and director general of the party's international bureau,
urged the government to send non-combatant personnel, such as
medical teams, to the Mideast. "Japan must refrain from
simply sending money every time a crisis occurs," Mr. Aichi
said.
   The Diet member called the present crisis a "perfect
opportunity" for Japan to take a more active role in the
kinds of conflicts that will characterize the "post-Cold War
period." And he warned that "Kaifu's decision not to go could
send the wrong signal." He expressed the hope that Foreign
Minister Taro Nakayama, who will be visiting the five
countries this week in Mr. Kaifu's place, will be prepared to
demonstrate Japan's willingness to contribute beyond simply
giving money."
   Mr. Aichi said that "at the least, we should take action
without being pressured by the initiatives of others. If this
isn't done, it could turn into another incident when Japan is
perceived as only grudgingly taking on its responsibilities."
   But others say the caution is natural as long as 335
Japanese citizens remain in Iraq. The fate of these Japanese
was one factor in the government's internal debates over
whether Mr. Kaifu should go ahead with his trip. If he went,
he would have to make a clear statement to his Arab hosts
criticizing Iraq and affirming Japan's sanctions -- or risk a
backlash from the U.S. and Europe. But, said a noted
professor who refuses to be identified, "Some of the Japanese
residents in Iraq might be executed if the government makes a
very clear statement against Iraq.
   And caution is a natural instinct for a prime minister in
Mr. Kaifu's political circumstances. Lacking a power base
among the political pros of his own Liberal Democratic Power,
the 59-year-old prime minister was expected to last no more
than a few months in office. But last week he passed the
one-year mark with public-support ratings of around 60%, the
highest of any recent prime minister.
   Many commentators think Mr. Kaifu could keep his job for
some time, assuming he doesn't blunder: And a trip to a
suddenly tense Middle East without a well-thought out
Japanese role would have given him ample opportunities for
blundering.
