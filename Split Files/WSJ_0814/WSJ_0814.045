   A partial blackout of New York's financial district barely
disrupted a quiet day of trading in the over-the-counter
market, traders said.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.27 to 408.30, a 0.1%
gain, buoyed by a late-afternoon rally in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. OTC volume of 87.6 million shares fell
from Friday's 112 million shares and decliners led gainers,
1,143 to 799. Shearson Lehman's New York trading operations,
which typically handle about 17% of OTC volume, were among
those idled by the downtown power loss.

   More than one-third of the workstations serving
over-the-counter traders in New York initially were downed by
the power outage, according to the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which operates the over-the-counter
market.
   However, traders in New York and at regional firms across
the country said investors remained wary of developments in
the Middle East and largely stayed away from the OTC market.
   "Because the market was so quiet, I don't think the
blackout had much effect," said Lance Zipper, head of OTC
trading at Kidder Peabody. Kidder was one of the few New York
firms where OTC trading wasn't halted when a fire at a
Consolidated Edison Co. substation in lower Manhattan
interrupted power to much of New York's financial district.
   Mr. Zipper said he didn't see any marked increase in
business because of the misfortunes of some of his
competitors.
   "It was quiet before the fire and it was quiet after the
fire," said Mr. Zipper. "There wasn't any business to pick
up," he added. "The market was dead anyway," agreed E.E.
"Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine &amp; Geduld, whose
firm also traded throughout the day uninterrupted.
   Nearly 600 terminals serving OTC traders in the New York
area were initially shut down when the substation fire
interrupted service to one of three central NASD computers in
the New York area, according to John T. Wall, NASD executive
vice president of marketing operations. By the end of the
day, power had been restored to half of those terminals
through a backup system based in Trumbull, Conn. NASD has
1,457 terminals serving the New York area.
   Many firms such as Shearson relayed business to their
offices outside of New York. Others transferred their
operations to regional offices of other brokerage firms that
weren't affected, Mr. Wall said. He added that NASD is making
its own trading operations at its offices in Trumbull, New
York and Rockville, Md., available to market makers whose
buildings remain without power today.
   The OTC market's biggest stocks led the day's activity.
The Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the OTC's 100 largest
shares, rose 2.38 to 414.84. Among other strong sectors, the
Nasdaq Utilities Index gained 2.89 to 557.14.
   Insurance stocks were among the day's biggest losers. The
Nasdaq Insurance Index fell 2.02 to 470.97.
   Sun Microsystems, the day's most active stock, fell 1 1/2
to 29 1/2 on 3.2 million shares. The Mountain View, Calif.,
maker of computer workstations filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for a proposed combination offering of
seven million shares. More than 5.9 million of those shares
will be newly issued; the rest will be sold by shareholders.
   Among other active stocks, MCI Communications gained 7/8
to 35 3/8, Apple Computer added 1 1/8 to 39 7/8; Seagate
Technology rose 3/4 to 11; Conner Peripherals jumped 1 1/4 to
24 7/8, and Nike sprinted 1 1/4 to 75 1/2.
   Amgen jumped 2 1/2 to 46 1/2 after shares of the Thousand
Oaks, Calif., biotechnology company split two-for-one
yesterday.
   William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons, Baltimore, was among several regional market makers who
said they didn't see a marked increase in business because of
the breakdown in operations at a number of New York firms. He
attributed the day's relatively smooth and light trading to
the nature of the OTC market, which uses multiple dealers
across the country, and to caution among investors in smaller
issues.
   "People are relatively content to see what happens in the
world without making any big commitments one way or the
other," Mr. Rothe said. "At the moment, cash is king."
   With about six weeks remaining in the fiscal quarter, Mr.
Rothe isn't seeing much inclination among money managers to
commit capital to OTC stocks. He attributed yesterday's
rebound in larger OTC issues to the late-afternoon rally in
bigger stocks, a "technical" bounce in shares that have been
pressured recently and to some short-covering by traders.
When traders "cover their shorts," they buy shares to replace
stocks that they previously borrowed and sold. A short-seller
hopes to profit by replacing borrowed shares later at a lower
price.
   Among other large OTC stocks, Intel was unchanged at 38
1/4. The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of semiconductors
announced jointly with Picturetel a five-year agreement for
joint development of interactive digital video processing
technology. Picturetel gained 1 1/4 to 12 7/8.
   Riggs National surged 1 3/4 to 14 3/4. Late Friday, the
Washington, D.C., bank said it will pay $33 million for the
assets and deposits of National Bank of Washington, a failed
bank in the nation's capital. Riggs added 1/2 on Friday.
   Applebee's International fell 1 1/4 to 13 1/4, even though
the operator of franchised restaurants reported earnings of
10 cents a share for the second quarter, compared with a
year-earlier loss of 11 cents a share.
   Chemical Fabrics tumbled 3 to 20 1/2 after the maker of
high-performance coated fabrics reported that its fiscal
fourth-quarter net income fell to one cent a share from 23
cents a share a year ago. The latest quarter's $26,000 profit
was after a pretax charge of $2.9 million related to damages
assessed against the company in a dispute over construction
of a roof for Minneapolis' Metrodome stadium.
   CPC-Rexcel rose 1/2 to 2 1/4 after the maker of plastic
containers reported net income rose to two cents a share in
the second quarter from break-even a year earlier.
   The American Depositary Receipts of LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton fell 4 1/4 to 143 3/4. The luxury-goods maker
reported that sales rose only 2% in the first half of 1990,
largely due to the effect of the dollar and yen's decline
against the French franc. The company said sales would have
been up 13% on a constant exchange-rate basis.
