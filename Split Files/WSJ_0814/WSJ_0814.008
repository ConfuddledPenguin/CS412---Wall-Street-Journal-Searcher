   The savings and loan debacle is causing one of the largest
regional transfers of wealth in American history. Taxpayers
across the country are being stuck with the tab for a
speculative construction boom in the sunbelt. Southwesterners
trying to distract attention from this aspect of the scandal
have been looking northward in search of a scapegoat. Their
gaze has focused upon Wall Street brokers and their clients.
   It is claimed that the major beneficiaries of the scandal
are wealthy investors from across the nation who sought high
interest rates from high-flying southwestern thrifts with the
assistance of Wall Street brokers. Unfortunately, this notion
seems to have become the conventional wisdom without serious
examination.

   While there is anecdotal evidence of thrifts that have
relied heavily on brokered deposits, the importance of such
deposits has been greatly exaggerated. In December 1989,
brokered deposits comprised only 7% of thrift deposits
nationwide, and only 9% of deposits in Texas, where the vast
majority of thrift failures have been concentrated. There is
no evidence to support the claim that a majority of deposits
in insolvent southwestern thrifts came from other regions.
   But the location of the depositors is actually beside the
point. The important question in determining whether a
transfer of wealth is occurring is not where the depositors
live, but where their money was invested. The deregulation of
the nation's thrift industry started out as an effort to
reduce the role of government in the market place. It ended
up as the largest regional economic development program in
U.S. history.
   The 1980s were a period of hostility to traditional
federal economic development programs. It was claimed that
such programs "distorted the marketplace" and should be the
responsibility of the private sector and state and local
government. Many programs important to the northeast and
midwest were severely reduced or eliminated. These included
Urban Development Action Grants, Community Development Block
Grants, EPA wastewater treatment grants and Urban Mass
Transit Administration programs.
   This disdain for federal involvement in the market place
curtailed federal economic development activities in the
northeast and midwest at the same time as disdain for
government actually spurred economic activity in the
southwest. When the federal government loosened regulations
on federally chartered thrifts, the state of Texas went even
further.
   Few people realize that we have a "dual banking system"
based upon a federal state partnership with states regulating
state chartered thrifts, while the federal government
provides deposit insurance. Unfortunately, in recent years
this federal state partnership was badly abused by state
regulators in Texas (and other states) who gave owners of
state regulated thrifts free rein to engage in highly risky
activities with funds backed by federal deposit insurance.
Many state chartered thrifts were acquired by developers who
used them as private banks to finance the development of
office buildings, shopping centers and apartment complexes.
   These thrifts attracted deposits like a magnet by offering
the highest interest rates in the nation. From 1980 to 1985,
federally insured deposits in state-chartered Texas thrifts
grew by a staggering 186 percent. But these thrift
owner/developers did not worry about the risk associated with
their ventures. When the bottom fell out of the Texas economy
in 1986, taxpayers across the country were left holding the
bag. And Texas was left with the property.
   The magnitude of this regional economic development
program can be illustrated by looking at the inventory of
property held by the Resolution Trust Corporation. In March
1990, the RTC held $15 billion worth of repossessed property.
Of that, $10.2 billion, or 68%, was located in the state of
Texas.
   What does this mean for the future? A recent Commerce
Department report concluded that the southwest will be the
fastest growing region in the nation in the 1990s. While this
glut of property is currently dampening real estate values,
it will stimulate growth in the years ahead. During the
recent economic summit in Houston, the city pulled out all
stops to convince the international press that Houston was an
excellent place for investment. One of their major selling
points: low-cost office space.
   The costs to date to clean up state chartered thrifts in
Texas are staggering. Since the bail-out began in 1988, $29
billion in costs have resulted from insolvent state chartered
thrifts across the nation. The 18 states of the
Northeast-Midwest region caused only $1.3 billion, or 5%, of
that $29 billion. Some $21 billion, or 72%, is due to
insolvent state-chartered thrifts in Texas.
   The northeast and midwest regions are being hit with a
triple whammy. First, although the northern states have
rigorously regulated their state-chartered thrifts, they are
being stuck with billions of dollars in costs from a state
that did not. Second, the enormous cost of this scandal will
reduce the federal government's flexibility to make much
needed investments in economic development in the northeast
and midwest. Third, northern taxpayers have financed billions
of dollars worth of development in an area with which their
states will compete for private investment for years to come.
   Some people may not want to call it a transfer of wealth,
but it comes down to this: through state policy, Texas
encouraged a massive construction boom and -- by abusing the
federal deposit insurance system -- has levied a tax on our
citizens to pay for it. If that isn't a transfer of wealth,
we don't know what is. To point the finger at Wall Street is
a feeble attempt to obscure this fact.
