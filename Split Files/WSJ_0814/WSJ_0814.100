   WASHINGTON -- Mayor Marion Barry switched his party
affiliation to independent from Democrat as a prelude to a
possible run for an at-large seat on the Washington City
Council.
   Mr. Barry took the preliminary step toward reviving his
political career only three days after he was convicted of a
misdemeanor cocaine-possession charge. A federal court jury
acquitted the three-term mayor on another cocaine-possession
charge and deadlocked on 12 other counts, including drug
possession, conspiracy and perjury. A sentencing date hasn't
been set.

   Mr. Barry has said he won't run again for mayor. At a news
conference yesterday, he refused to commit himself to any
particular race, including one for a seat on the 13-member
council. He had to switch political affiliation to remain
eligible for the November ballot. He must make a final
decision whether to run within the next two weeks.
   Smiling enigmatically, the mayor said he changed his
registration "to keep my options." He acknowledged, however,
that some close associates have urged him to leave politics.
