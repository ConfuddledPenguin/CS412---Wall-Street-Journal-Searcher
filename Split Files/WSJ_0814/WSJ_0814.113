   New Brunswick Scientific Co. reported a wider loss in the
second quarter, citing a softer market for laboratory
equipment among its university and government agency
customers.
   The Edison, N.J., company reported a loss of $1.1 million,
or 32 cents a share, compared with a loss of $121,000, or
three cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were $7.7 million,
down from $8.1 million.

   The company said it completed a workforce reduction of
25%, to about 340 employees, in order to offset a downturn in
orders. It said its Eastern Europe export business was down
considerably.
