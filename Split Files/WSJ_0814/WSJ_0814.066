SUPREME COURT (SUP)

   Michael Gartner ("We Wuz Robbed] (That's Only My Opinion,
Of Course"), Viewpoint, July 19) is exactly right. It is only
his opinion.
   And I disagree with him.

   What the Supreme Court seems to be saying in its latest
ruling on the First Amendment is not that free speech should
be shackled but rather that published opinions rendered on
another ought to be based at least on some semblance of fact,
regardless of who is doing the rendering -- journalist,
lawyer, securities analyst, banker, whoever. In layman's
language this means there's now some litigable limit on how
loosely one's good name and reputation may be trashed in
public. Somehow that strikes me as a fair attempt to rein in
First Amendment abuses.
   In other words, I would contend that most of us "wuz
helped]" not robbed by the court's decision.
