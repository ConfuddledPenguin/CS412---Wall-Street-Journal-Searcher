   MINEOLA, N.Y. -- Robeson Industries Corp. said it agreed
to sell as much as 50.1% of its common stock outstanding to a
subsidiary of General Electronics Ltd., Hong Kong.
   Carl Singer, chairman of Robeson, said the deal should
alleviate a cash squeeze brought on by the company's
restructuring.

   "The restructuring decimated the company's working capital
to the point that we needed additional capital," Mr. Singer
said. An earlier agreement to sell a 30% interest to a
Japanese consumer electronics distributor fell through.
   The General Electronics subsidiary, General Electronics
(Overseas) Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company, agreed to
purchase $750,000 of newly issued Robeson common stock and
assume a $500,000 three-year interest-free promissory note
issued by Robeson, which is convertible into Robeson common.
General Electronics will also receive a one-year warrant to
buy an additional $750,000 of Robeson common.
   If General Electronics converts the note and exercises the
warrant, it will hold a majority interest in Robeson. The
agreement, however, entitles it to nominate only two of the
seven members of Robeson's board.
   Mr. Singer said that he has been closing down Robeson's
U.S. manufacturing facilities and focusing on marketing a
broad line of kitchen appliances, household fans and heaters,
much of it through its Hong Kong outpost.
   He said Robeson expects to report a profit in the next
quarter, its first in more than three years, but didn't
specify the amount. He projects sales of $35 million to $37
million in 1990, down from $42 million last year.
