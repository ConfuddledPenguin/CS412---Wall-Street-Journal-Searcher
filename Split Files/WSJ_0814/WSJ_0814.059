   News yesterday that the Dutch are dispatching two frigates
to the Persian Gulf offered some further encouragement that
continental Europe is not going to duck its responsibilities
for dealing with the Kuwait crisis. But the response so far
has been slow and it remains to be seen how much real help
the U.S., the United Kingdom and Turkey will get from their
NATO allies.
   Failure to participate more vigorously by sending ground
forces and ground-based aircraft will be a far less safe
course than continental Europeans might imagine. If a
shooting war breaks out and U.S. soldiers are forced to carry
the main burden of the fighting, there could easily be a
violent reaction against Europe in the United States.
Americans know that Europeans are far more dependent on
Persian Gulf oil than Americans. They will be asking,
legitimately, why it is that American soldiers, sailors and
airmen are always being asked to pull Europe's chestnuts out
of the fire.

   Such a reaction will, in turn, fuel demands in the U.S.
that American forces be withdrawn from Europe. Such demands
had been aired in the U.S. press, by some writers from both
the right and left, well before the latest crisis. The left
wants the troops out because it wants disarmament and the
"peace dividend." The right wants them out because it sees no
justification in requiring American taxpayers to help protect
the security of a wealthy Europe.
   While it would be technically possible for the U.S. to
withdraw from Europe and still preserve the NATO alliance, it
is doubtful that NATO would last long under such
circumstances. NATO has a certain symmetry now, with a
European secretary general and an American as Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR). With a U.S. withdrawal, it could
soon lose that symmetry, raising questions about which
country is to lead Europe's defense, or even whether a
Europe-wide security system is possible. France already
operates outside the NATO command structure.
   That, in turn, could result in political fragmentation,
not only splitting Europe and North America into separate
power blocks, but possibly even splitting Europe itself into
blocks and alliances reminiscent of the bad old days before
NATO when power politics dominated the continent. Intelligent
people on the continent, the more perceptive Germans in
particular, do not want America to leave Europe for precisely
that reason. But given the political dynamics of the moment,
wishing will not necessarily prevent it.
   It does not help when continental politicians, such as
German Social Democrat Karsten Voight, say the Persian Gulf
is none of their business. There is a certain arrogance in
such comments, suggesting that messy things like wars are
beneath the dignity of Europeans. That dignity, if you want
to call it that, is preserved only by someone else's courage.
Even with U.S. backing, Europe's security is by no means
guaranteed. It is widely asserted that a Soviet threat no
longer exists, but Soviet military power did not collapse
with the Berlin wall. The political and economic chaos that
is wracking the Soviet Union could easily yield up a new
Stalin capable of intimidating a future disarmed and
disorganized western Europe.
   For that matter, no one can foretell what will transpire
in the Middle East over the next few days. The U.S. welcomed
the support of Egyptian and Syrian forces in defending Saudi
Arabia because it wanted to block Saddam Hussein's attempts
to incite Arabs against the West. But as Saddam has amply
demonstrated, Arab relationships are mercurial. A leader of
Western military forces cannot be entirely comfortable having
Arab forces both in front of him and to his rear even if the
ones to the rear are supposedly on his side. More European
soldiers would reduce the level of discomfort.
   Moreover, if war breaks out, there will be less bloodshed
if the allies can immediately apply overwhelming force. If
Saddam's air and missile forces are knocked out quickly, he
will be less able to take some desperate gamble, such as
launching a poison gas attack on the allies or Israel. That
too argues for broader participation.
   Perhaps the slow reaction on the continent merely is a
function of the time required to organize joint operations.
We hope so. If it is yet another attempt to duck
responsibility, Europe's future security will be subject to
serious doubts.
