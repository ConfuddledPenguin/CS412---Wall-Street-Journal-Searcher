   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Equitec Financial Group Inc., posting a
net loss for the second quarter of $3.4 million, or 68 cents
a share, disclosed it now is in default on all of its debt
obligations outstanding.
   For the year-ago period, the financial services company
had a loss of $3.3 million, or 68 cents a share. That figure
includes a loss of $2 million from discontinued operations.

   Revenue for the recent period declined 30%, to $8.3
million from $11.8 million.
   For the six months ended June 30, Equitec posted a net
loss of $8.8 million, or $1.78 a share, which includes losses
from continuing operations of $7.7 million and from
discontinued operations of $1.1 million.
   For the year-earlier period, Equitec had a net loss of
$4.6 million, or 93 cents a share, which included losses from
continuing operations of $2.6 million, and from discontinued
operations of $2 million.
   Revenue for the recent six months declined 25%, to $16.8
million from $22.3 million.
   During the quarter just ended, Equitec said it failed to
make the interest payment on its 12% senior subordinated
debentures, thus placing it in default on all its debt
outstanding.
   Richard L. Saalfield, Equitec chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company continues to work with its advisers
to "investigate alternative methods of restructuring its debt
and other obligations."
