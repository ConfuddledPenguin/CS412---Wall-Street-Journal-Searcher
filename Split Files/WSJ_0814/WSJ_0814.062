   JAPAN'S IMPORT OMBUDSMAN

   Japan's Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman will
broaden its work to process claims concerning market openness
and smooth entry of imports, an agency official said. The
office also decided to add up to three non-Japanese to its
now eight-member advisory council.
   In the Structural Impediment Initiative bilateral trade
talks that ended in June, Tokyo promised the U.S. it would
broaden the function of the agency. The talks were aimed at
breaking down Japanese barriers to imports and correcting
U.S. investment imbalances.
   Members of the council decided to expand its scope to
handle "concrete" complaints by foreign companies concerning
the smooth entry of imports, the official said. This will
allow the agency, among other things, to process claims
concerning direct investment in Japan, according to the
official.
   The agency was established in 1982 to receive and process
claims regarding Japan's import standards and certification
system. Yesterday's decision will probably be presented at a
follow-up meeting of the bilateral talks to be held this
fall.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN CHEMICALS
                                                                                                       

   Western chemical companies have so far invested only
modestly in East Germany companies, according to a report by
the Center for Information and Documentation in East Berlin.
Western reticence is due to the large number of plants with
high pollution emissions and the enormous costs associated
with cleaning up already polluted land and rivers in East
Germany. The West German Chemical Industry Association has
said East German chemical firms should cover the costs of
environmental cleanup themselves.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN TV SATELLITE
                                                                                                       

   Societe Europeennee des Satellites, operator of Europe's
first privately owned satellite network, said a number of
international aerospace companies are bidding to supply the
company with a third satellite. The Luxembourg-based
company's first satellite, Astra 1a, was launched by the
European Ariane rocket in December 1988. It began
transmitting to television stations across Europe in February
1989. Among the users of Astra 1a are Sky Channel, the
pop-music channel MTV and Eurosport. A second satellite,
Astra 1b, is due to be launched at the end of this year.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE EXPORT QUALITY
                                                                                                       

   Chinese authorities are waging a sometimes losing battle
in their effort to improve the quality of goods made for
export. While some improvements have been recorded since new
quality-control and inspection laws were enacted in August
1989, the track record of many Chinese exporters is still
dismal, official reports show. In one case, nearly 75% of the
cloth produced by Taiyuan Cotton Textile Mill, in northern
Shanxi province, was found to be of poor quality.
                                                                                                       

   TURKISH POWER PLANT
                                                                                                       

   Eight Japanese companies will set up a joint venture with
the Turkish government to build and run an electric power
plant in Turkey. Under the arrangement, the Turkish
government will be able to build the plant, learn how to run
and maintain the system and eventually take full ownership
without having to pay more than 30% of the costs of
construction, according to a spokesman for Electric Power
Development, one of the Japanese companies involved in the
project. Under the arrangement, the eight companies will
provide 70% of the capital for the 18 billion-yen ($119.6
million) joint venture; staterun TEK, a Turkish power
company, will contribute the rest.
                                                                                                       

   BUSINESS AS USUAL
                                                                                                       

   Saddam Hussein hasn't yet scared tourists from Egypt,
Turkey and Jordan.
   Despite ominous headlines, a military buildup in Saudi
Arabia and Iraq's threats of a holy war against the U.S.,
hotels, airlines and travel agencies serving the Eastern
Mediterranean have reported few cancellations from Western
travelers.
   "Up until now, business is better than we expected, said
Rico de Schepper, general manager of the Nile Hilton in
Cairo. "So far, we haven't received any cancellations." Pan
Am and TWA said flights to Cairo, Istanbul and Ankara are
running normally.
   A U.S. travel agent said Egyptair flights out of the U.S.
are wait-listed for the rest of the summer. The London office
of Royal Jordanian Airlines said it just received bookings
for a 14-person group to travel to Amman next month, and a
90-person group next May.
   European charter carriers said it's more or less business
as usual.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The hottest fad on Taiwanese television is a crop of talk
shows that let studio audiences thrash out their marital
problems on national broadcasts. In Taiwan, one in five
marriages ends in divorce, according to government
statistics. . . . New Turkish carrier Greenair offers several
promotions on its domestic flights. The most unusual is a 50%
discount for women who have green eyes.
