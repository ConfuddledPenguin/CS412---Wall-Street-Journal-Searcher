   WASHINGTON -- For water to reach the drains in the garage
at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, it
must flow uphill.
   Gravity being what it is, even here in the nation's
capital, it doesn't. The result is that the water --
rainwater mostly -- has been collecting in pools for years,
stagnating, and now the concrete is cracking. Popping through
the cracked concrete are rusting steel reinforcing rods.

   The cost to fix the 1,400-car garage: $15 million.
   But that's only part of the problem. The marble that coats
the huge, 25 million-cubic-foot structure on the banks of the
Potomac River is beginning to buckle just like the concrete
in the garage. Marble slabs -- high-priced Carrara from Italy
-- actually undulate. They bend and weave, and soon they may
begin falling off. Up on the roof terrace, the marble
planters are leaking, and water sometimes pours down into the
Grand Foyer. Carrara marble, it turns out 19 years after this
national cultural center was opened, isn't appropriate for
Washington's 95-degree summers and 20-degree winters.
   The cost to fix the main building itself: $15 million
more.
   But that's still not the end of it. Over the years, the
center, just like the national government itself, has been
running up a deficit. In recent years, thanks, in part, to
the center taking over the deeply distressed National
Symphony Orchestra and pumping $500,000 into Annie 2, one of
the biggest bombs in recent musical-comedy history, the debt
has blossomed.
   The cost to retire the debt: another $15 million.
   The center's new chairman, New York investment banker
James D. Wolfensohn, expects Congress to come up with the
cash -- all $45 million of it -- now. "What we say to
Congress is this," says Mr. Wolfensohn. "Please help us get
to the starting line, and we'll take it from there,
absolutely." But his request is raising new questions about
the center's role and who should be paying for what.
   The Kennedy Center is a half-living memorial to the late
president and half-performing-arts center, with 7,000 seats
in six separate theaters. The government, through the
National Park Service, pays for maintaining the building --
most of it anyway -- and the center's 41 trustees (they
include Mr. Wolfensohn) raise the cash to put on the shows.
   What Mr. Wolfensohn calls the "gray area" is the theaters
themselves. No one is quite sure who should pay for their
upkeep. Some lack modern sound systems. In one of the big
ones, the Opera House, stagehands still raise and lower the
curtain by hand. All of the theaters are deteriorating. Mr.
Wolfensohn, an amateur cellist who numbers many of the
world's leading musicians as personal friends, hopes to cut a
deal on that so that the government pays those costs too.
That's down the road, but it could add up to as much as $10
million.
   This is the center that brought culture to the nation's
provincial capital. Before it was built, the biggest venue in
town was the Daughters of the American Revolution's
Constitution Hall, best-remembered as the place that turned
away Marian Anderson because she was black.
   Though the center is named for a Democratic president, it
was begun by a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, whose favorite
orchestra was led by Lawrence Welk. President Eisenhower
signed the enabling legislation in 1958.
   The architect was Edward Durell Stone. His grandiose plans
included the romantic notion that guests should arrive at
what he called "the people's shrine to culture" by barge. In
time, his plans were tempered. The contractor was
Philadelphia's John McShain, whose Democratic political
credentials were impeccable.
   What emerged by opening night in 1971 (the center had
become a memorial to Mr. Kennedy in 1964) was a huge, $73
million, marble-sided barn covering three separate interior
buildings -- the Opera House, the Eisenhower Theater and the
Concert Hall, all entered from the Grand Foyer, one of the
world's largest rooms.
   Tucked into the building, too, are three smaller theaters,
along with restaurants and a cafeteria. But no one thought to
supply office space, and so the center's 182 employees are
jammed into what was once storage room. "It's a rabbit
warren," says Mr. Wolfensohn, whose offices at his own
investment house in New York and at that city's Carnegie
Hall, which he also heads, are more suitably grand.
   There were problems right from the start. The building
leaked like an old, waterlogged barge. Experts blamed the
design -- or the contractor, and sometimes both. The
government came up with a modest amount of money for repairs.
But now the center is leaking all over again.
   "When they water the planters up on the roof terrace,
water pours right down through the light sockets inside the
building," says Joseph Lawler, the Park Service's manager at
the center.
   "You can walk in the main entrance here and get soaking
wet on a sunny day," says Geraldine Otremba, the center's
operations director.
   Part of the problem is that there are only 12 drains for
the flat, 136,800-square-foot roof. "We always have problems
with flat roofs," says Mr. Lawler. "This one doesn't have
enough pitch or enough drains." Part of the problem, too, is
the Italian marble itself; it isn't tough enough. Even more
serious is the failure to install enough expansion joints.
The building is 600 feet long, but it has just two expansion
joints, each three inches wide. "The building doesn't have
enough room to expand and contract," says Ms. Otremba. "We're
going to have to put in more expansion joints," says Mr.
Lawler.
   There are mechanical problems, too. "The air-conditioning
coils and chillers are rusting," says Mr. Lawler. "One of
these hot nights, we're going to lose it."
   To top it off, all the willow trees in front of the center
are dying.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of
the appropriations subcommittee charged with funding the
center, thinks Congress will pay for the repairs and retire
the deficit, in installments. "If you want a center like
this, you have no other choice," he says. But he also
believes Mr. Wolfensohn and his trustees will be required to
raise more money from the private sector in the years ahead.
"That's in the nature of the cost-sharing arrangement we have
here," he says.
   Still unsettled after all these years is a more
philosophical question: What do you do with the building?
   Mr. Wolfensohn, fresh from his triumph restoring Carnegie
Hall, thinks big. He likes extravaganzas. He thinks so big
that the center's artistic director, Marta Istomin, who tends
to think small ("Sensational events can produce questionable
results," she said), resigned. Mr. Wolfensohn looks forward
to the center's showpiece effort next year -- a Texas
festival.
   But Mr. Wolfensohn may be on the right track. Washington,
for all its cultural growth, still isn't New York, London or
Paris, and highbrow performances don't always sell. "She
Always Said, Pablo," a murky play about Pablo Picasso and
Gertrude Stein, closed two weeks early a few days ago. But
still knocking the natives dead, night after night -- the
most successful show at the center, making $30,000 a month --
is a lightweight, audience-participation whodunit called
"Shear Madness." President Bush has been to the center to see
it twice.
