   There are times in my life
   When there's need for a change,
   Positions I've taken
   That I must rearange;
   Some attitudes assumed
   That I cannot abide,
   And that's when, with effort,
   I turn onto my side.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   Some mount a soapbox to orate;
   I'm no unruly agitator.
   My views, for all to love or hate,
   Are taped to my refrigerator.
   -- Mary Mobilia.
