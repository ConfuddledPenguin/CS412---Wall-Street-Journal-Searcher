   New York -- Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) was born a year
before Picasso and survived Jackson Pollock by exactly a
decade. This is more than a mere historical curiosity, since
Hofmann started his career smack in the middle of early
European modernism and ended it as a leading American
abstract expressionist. He was unique in many ways, not the
least of these being that he worked his way through both the
pre- and postwar styles of both World Wars, and that he
formed a bridge between the avantgarde painting of two
continents.
   Hofmann was also one of the few artists, either here or
abroad, who succeeded in balancing the polarities of bright
color and geometrically fractured space typical of fauvism
and cubism, the two main opposing currents of modernist
painting. The way in which he struggled to do this for more
than half a century, and the resulting variety of his
imagery, are made abundantly clear in the Whitney Museum of
American Art's retrospective exhibition, which includes more
than 100 paintings and drawings done between 1898 and 1965.

   Despite the length of his career, Hofmann did not have an
easy time of it. It was not until 1944, when he was 64 years
old, that he had his first one-man show in New York. In fact,
for most of his life he was known primarily not as an artist
but as a gifted teacher. Born in Germany, he worked in Paris
for several years during the first decade of the century and
became a kind of apostle of modernism. Caught in Germany at
the outbreakof World War I, and found unfit for military
service, he started his first art school in Munich in 1915.
He would remain deeply involved in teaching for the next 43
years.
   During the early 1930s, Hofmann transferred his teaching
activities to the U.S., first to California, then to the East
Coast. His schools in New York and Provincetown became
legendary, and in the decade after World War II he was widely
regarded as the most inspired art teacher in the country.
Twenty years ago, it seemed that everyone on the New York art
scene had once studied with Hans Hofmann, or at least claimed
to have done so. Among his students were a number of artists
who would go on to win major recognition, including Helen
Frankenthaler, Red Grooms, Lee Krasner, Louise Nevelson,
Larry Rivers and Myron Stout.
   That Hofmann was a highly regarded and influential teacher
is beyond question. His status as an artist, on the other
hand, is quite another matter. You come away from this show
feeling that throughout most of his career Hofmann was an
accomplished but not very inspired painter, and that it was
not until the last decade of his life that he really caught
fire and produced significant work.
   And yet, because of the brilliant way that the curator
Cynthia Goodman has installed the exhibition, this is not as
painfully apparent as it might be. For you enter this show at
the end, as it were -- amid the brightly colored, energetic
and powerful pictures that Hofmann painted during the last
decade of his life. And I would strongly suggest lingering in
these three front galleries for a while before venturing into
the back galleries that contain the early works.
   These late works are quite literally inspiring, for
several reasons. Here, for one thing, is the work of an
artist who for many years seems to have been thinking,
"Someday . . ." And here, rarity of rarities, that someday
really comes -- when he is in his mid-70s. Until then
Hofmann's situation is like that of a musician who has
extraordinary manual dexterity and a deep understanding of
his medium, but who can never quite get beyond making music
in a secondhand way. A performer rather than a creator.
Usually such people never really cross the line. But",
mirabile dictu", Hans Hofmann does.
   Going through the earlier work, you find yourself rooting
for the man. How could it be otherwise? There is so much
pictorial understanding evident in the early works, and so
much sheer willpower. The brightly colored and firmly drawn
"Table With Fruit and Coffeepot" (1936) almost makes the wall
shake. But the trouble is, you keep seeing the ghost of
someone else. Here it is Matisse. In the lovely 1914
watercolors it was Cezanne. In paintings of the '20s and
early '30s, it was Picasso or Braque or Bonnard, or an
earlier version of Matisse.
   The color throughout remains strong, if somewhat
indiscriminate -- every instrument playing as loud as
possible and all at once. But all those primary colors all at
once can be a bit wearing. The drawing throughout remains
vigorous, if somewhat approximate. Sometimes, as in the 1942
"Self-Portrait With Brushes," the overly stylized design is
irritating and rings false. The face is familiar but nobody
seems to be home.
   And then suddenly, you're back in those last rooms again,
back in the mid 1950sjust around the time that Hofmann closes
his school, is it merely a coincidence?and everything begins
to come together. In paintings like "Equipoise" (1958) the
primary colors are still there, all at full blast, but now
they somehow gather energy instead of dispersing it. The
surfaces become tenser and more unified. Rectangles push and
pull against each other, detach themselves from the bright
green background, are pulled back into it. There is a real
dialogue going on here, between the elements of the picture
and between the man and his inner self.
   Unified as these late pictures are, they are built on
strong contrasts: between amorphous blobs and insistent
rectangles, between smeary mud colors and planes of searing
chromatic intensity. These are particularly evident in the
Museum of Modern Art's "Memoria in Aeternum" (1962), a
picture of literally astonishing resourcefulness and
intensity, in which the echoes of fauvism and cubism are
still felt, but in an entirely fresh way. Which is, after
all, what artistic originality is all about.
   The exhibition, which is accompanied by a handsome
catalog, will be on view through Sept. 16. It will also be
seen at the Center for Fine Arts, Miami (Nov. 22-Jan. 20,
1991) and the Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Va. (Feb. 14-April
14).
