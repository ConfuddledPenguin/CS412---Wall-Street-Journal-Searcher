   LVMH Moet-Hennessy-Louis Vuitton S.A. said its
consolidated revenue rose to 8.823 billion francs ($1.65
billion) in the first half, up 2% from the year-earlier 8.63
billion francs.
   The French champagne, cognac, baggage and perfume group
said in a communique that first-half turnover growth was
limited by the franc's 11% rise against the dollar during the
period and its 22% rise against the yen. It said that, on a
constant exchange rate basis, first-half sales would have
shown a 13% rise.

   LVMH underlined that its 1990 net income figures won't be
as sensitive to the franc's strength as its revenue figures
were, thanks to the group's systematic currency hedging
policy. It reiterated its previous 1990 net income forecast,
made at an annual meeting of shareholders in June, for a gain
of about 15% from the 1989 total of 2.932 billion francs.
Sales of cognac and spirits rose 6% to 2.455 billion francs
from 2.325 billion a year earlier. Sales of perfume and
beauty products rose 6% as well, to 2.168 billion francs from
2.043 billion.
   But sales of leather goods and luggage eased 3% to 2.179
billion francs from 2.257 billion while turnover from
champagne and wines edged down 0.3% to 1.840 billion francs
from 1.846 billion.
