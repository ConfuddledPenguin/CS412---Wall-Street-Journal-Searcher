   DALLAS -- Boston investor Andre Danesh said he is seeking
financing to buy as much as 100% of the notes and preferred
shares and as much as 49% of the common stock in Southmark
Corp., which just emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection.
   Mr. Danesh, whose Allied Financial Corp. investment firm
specializes in insolvent companies, apparently hopes the
investment will prevent Southmark's management from selling
off its troubled real estate assets.

   To reach his maximum targets at yesterday's closing
prices, Mr. Danesh would spend about $15 million for the
common stock and $20.5 million for the preferred stock, and
would negotiate a purchase of Southmark notes carrying a face
value of $75 million.
   Whether Southmark assets would prove to be a bargain at
that price is problematical. Federal thrift regulators could
seize Southmark's troubled San Jacinto Savings Association at
any moment. Disgruntled limited partners have ousted
Southmark as the general manager of many real estate
syndicates controlled by the Dallas-based real estate and
financial services concern.
   Southmark built its reorganization around San Jacinto. The
remainder of its assets are to be sold in a plan of
organization that went into effect last Friday.
   The plan also distributed 43 million common shares to its
creditors, who would then own San Jacinto. The $75 million in
notes and $100 million in preferred shares are to be redeemed
by sale of Southmark assets.
   Mr. Danesh said he disagrees with the plan's strategy.
"I'm not interested in selling real estate," he said. "I'm
just trying to put it back together. I don't like to sell
anything." He said he would work with management rather than
seek control.
   Mr. Danesh bought 10.3% of Southmark common shares last
November while the company was reorganizing. The
reorganization, plus subsequent sales, reduced his stake to
about one-half of one percent.
   New Southmark shares closed yesterday at $1.15625 in
national over-the-counter trading on a when-issued basis. The
preferred shares closed at $5.13.
