   WASHINGTON -- The top two Democrats in Congress warned
that President Bush wouldn't have an easy time getting
Congress's approval to go to war against Iraq.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley said Mr. Bush probably would
win congressional backing but that the vote wouldn't be
overwhelming. What's more, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said Congress wouldn't support giving Mr. Bush
open-ended authority to use military force.

   "I don't think such a resolution would pass," the Maine
Democrat said on NBC News's "Meet the Press" yesterday. "I
surely would not vote for it."
   Both Messrs. Foley and Mitchell favor continued use of
economic sanctions against Iraq and would consider force only
as a last resort.
   Speaker Foley said he doesn't think the president is
exaggerating his intention to go to war if Saddam Hussein
continues to refuse to withdraw from Kuwait. "I am convinced
that he's serious, deadly serious," Rep. Foley said at a
breakfast with reporters Friday. "I don't think there's any
posturing at all."
   Rep. Foley, a Washington state Democrat, said the
president should seek congressional approval before sending
U.S. troops into combat. But he noted that the president
clearly can begin the conflict unilaterally, and he said it
would be a mistake for Saddam Hussein to think otherwise.
   If the president sends U.S. forces into combat, Mr. Foley
said, Congress will surely back his move, and if Mr. Bush
asks permission first, Congress probably will lend its
support.
   "Right now, he'll get an affirmative vote," Rep. Foley
said. But he added, "It wouldn't be overwhelming."
   Congress might stay in session for at least part of the
two weeks in January that it has planned to be in recess, Mr.
Foley said, in case there is need for it to debate possible
war issues.
