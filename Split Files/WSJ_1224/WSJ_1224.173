   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's budget deficit
totaled $48.05 billion in November, compared with $29.73
billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.
   Last month's budget gap compared with a deficit of $31.46
billion in October. In its monthly statement, the Treasury
said receipts totaled $72.82 billion last month, compared
with $71.21 billion a year earlier and $78.71 billion in
October. Outlays totaled $120.87 billion last month, compared
with $100.95 billion a year earlier and $110.17 billion in
October.

   The slim increase in revenues and the big increase in
outlays reflected the slowing economy and increasing costs
because of the large U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf.
   For the first two months of fiscal 1991, which began Oct.
1, government receipts totaled $151.53 billion, compared with
$139.64 billion during the same period last year. Outlays
through November totaled $231.04 billion, compared with
$195.45 billion a year earlier. That produced a total deficit
of $79.51 billion for the first two months of fiscal 1991,
compared with $55.82 billion during the same period in the
previous fiscal year. The deficit for all of fiscal 1990 was
$220.39 billion.
   The government paid $21.88 billion in interest last month
on the federal debt.
   Revenue from the defense cooperation account, which
consists of contributions from U.S. allies to help cover the
cost of the U.S. military operation in Saudi Arabia, totaled
$2.82 billion in November, compared with $1.63 billion last
month, the Treasury said.
   Military outlays rose in November to $29.02 billion,
compared with $24.09 billion in October. So far in fiscal
1991, military spending has totaled $53.11 billion, up from
$43.73 billion for the same period in 1990.
