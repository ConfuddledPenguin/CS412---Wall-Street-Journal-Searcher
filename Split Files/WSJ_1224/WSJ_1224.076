   HOUSTON -- Allwaste Inc. said it plans to divest itself of
its troubled asbestos-removal division and report a one-time
charge of 13 cents a share for the first quarter ended Nov.
30 as a result of the decision.
   Part of the charge reflects the anticipated costs of
closing two offices in New York and Massachusetts "as soon as
practical." Remaining operations will be based in Houston.

   The environmental-services concern also said R.L. Nelson,
chairman and chief executive, was named to the additional
position of president, succeeding Clayton K. Trier, who
resigned as president, co-chief executive and a director, to
start a consulting practice. Mr. Trier will continue to work
with Allwaste as a consultant.
   Allwaste said that in addition to the first-quarter
charge, it expects to report a loss from discontinued
operations of about $2.4 million, or seven cents a share,
reflecting after-tax operating losses of the division. The
one-time charge and loss will be partially offset by a
nine-cents-a-share gain on the previously reported sale of a
manufacturing operation.
   The company didn't give an earnings estimate for the
quarter. In the year-earlier quarter, Allwaste had net income
of about $3 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $44.3
million.
