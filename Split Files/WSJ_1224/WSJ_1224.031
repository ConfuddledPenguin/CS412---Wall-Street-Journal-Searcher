   Tokyo stocks buckled Friday under early selling pressure
in response to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation Thursday and the yen's subsequent weakness,
traders said.
   Traders noted, however, that prices later were fairly
well-supported near 24000 points on the Nikkei, helped by
investment trust and dealer bargain-hunting.

   London stocks closed a bit higher in slow trading.
   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
405.34 points at 24119.60. The index lost 351.84 Thursday.
   Political uncertainty resulting from the resignation news
and rumors about the Middle East crisis added volatility to
the day's thin trading.
   Volume on the First Section was estimated at 350 million
shares, off from 393 million Thursday.
   Declining issues overwhelmed winning issues, 864 to 136,
while 114 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which fell 26.04 points Thursday, gave
up another 30.55 points, or 1.70%, to 1764.82.
   The Second Section Index, which declined 23.51 points
Thursday, lost 41.63 points, or 1.47%, to close at 2781.64.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 8.5 million
shares, nearly doubling from 4.5 million Thursday.
   The yen's decline, linked in part to Mr. Shevardnadze's
resignation, stifled buying and left the Nikkei exposed to
index-selling and profit-taking for the first half hour of
trading, participants said.
   The index lost nearly 500 points during that time,
remaining narrowly above 24000 points for most of the
session. Short-covering placed at 24,000 on the Nikkei helped
turn prices around, while other buying, some
arbitrage-related, was strong enough to keep the index from
collapsing.
   Amid low participation ahead of the long weekend and
approaching year-end holidays, the market conjured up rumors
ranging from a Soviet military coup to an Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait, traders said. The market will be closed today for a
national holiday.
   Middle East rumors mostly improved market hopes for a
peaceful settlement to the crisis, sparking some buying in
late afternoon that gave the index back almost half of its
early losses. But profit-taking sent the index lower again by
the close.
   Traders noted that Tokyo's reaction to Mr. Shevardnadze's
resignation was worsened by the market's characteristic
problems with digesting news on international foreign policy.
With details surrounding the foreign minister's resignation
still unclear, investors sold in modest amounts on the
uncertainty, they said.
   Because of the yen's weakness Friday, export-oriented
businesses such as bluechip electrical issues were mostly
firmer.
   TDK rose 100 yen (74 cents) to 4,640 yen, Pioneer added 30
yen to 4,080, Hitachi rose 10 to 1,130 and Kyocera added 150
to 6,000. But Sony closed flat at 6100.
   Banking, construction, steel and shipbuilding shares,
which led the market's recent rally, were mostly lower.
Mitsubishi Bank lost 150 to 2,070, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries fell 15 to 685 and IHI fell 15 to 685. Ohbayashi
dropped 14 to 870.
   London share prices finished just below the day's best
level Friday, as the market was prodded gently higher amid
stagnant, pre-holiday dealings.
   Business was described as extremely quiet and spiritless
as most investors merely rounded out positions ahead of the
weekend and before the onset of this week's Christmas
holidays.
   Dealers said London investors weren't paying much
attention to Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was up 7.17 points at 2636.63 when the London
business day drew to a close.
   The release of U.K. trade figures for November caused
little stir in the market. The data showed both the trade and
current account deficits at #971 million ($1.84 billion),
which was slightly larger than anticipated.
   At the closing bell, the closely monitored Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 5.6 points at
2164.4, up from the opening low of 2152.6 and just below the
midafternoon peak of 2164.6.
   In the futures market, the December FT-SE 100 index
contract settled at 2170.0 on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, up from 2163.0 Thursday.
   At its final calculation, the narrower FT 30 share index
was 1.2 points higher at 1688.4. Volume registered a mild
526.7 million shares, down from 590.2 million Thursday.
   Of the top 100 stocks in terms of market capitalization,
44 finished higher, 17 were unchanged and 39 closed lower.
   Troubled advertising group WPP fell 11 pence to 50 pence
in active dealings. The company said it won't pay an interim
dividend because of its weak cash flow.
   Glaxo shares gained 17 to 861 on what traders said was
strong buying support from the U.S. after several days of
steep falls last week. A total of 3.2 million shares changed
hands during the session.
   Rank Organisation shares finished 18 lower at 622 amid
thin turnover of 788,000 shares. Dealers said the stock fell
on one poorly placed trade, leaving a large amount of stock
overhanging the market.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Madrid, Zurich,
Frankfurt and Paris, mixed in Amsterdam and lower in Milan,
Stockholm and Brussels. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Singapore and Manila,
and higher in Taipei, Wellington and Seoul, while they closed
mixed in Hong Kong.
