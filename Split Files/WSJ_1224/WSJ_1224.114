   Warehouse Club Inc. said in Chicago that its earlier
agreement to sell about a 51% stake to Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea Co. for $11 million has been terminated.
   Under the tentative accord announced last month,
loss-plagued Warehouse Club was to issue 7.3 million new
shares to A&amp;P. "No other transaction between Warehouse Club
and A&amp;P is presently contemplated," the company said Friday.

   Warehouse Club didn't say why the deal collapsed, or
whether it intends to seek another investor. Warehouse
operates 10 stores that sell merchandise at wholesale or
near-wholesale prices; A&amp;P is a supermarket chain.
   Officials at A&amp;P, of Montvale, N.J., couldn't be reached
for comment. A&amp;P is 52%-owned by the Tengelmann Group of
Germany.
