   DALLAS -- A federal bankruptcy judge ordered Southland
Corp. to solicit a new vote of its creditors on the company's
reorganization plan, which had been approved by most
creditors before Southland sought bankruptcy-court protection
in October.
   Attorneys for the company and a group of dissident
bondholders who had objected to the earlier vote said they
don't expect the new vote to change the plans of Southland's
Japanese partners to buy a 70% stake in the company. The sale
to the Japanese is the key provision of Southland's
reorganization plan.

   "We don't believe the Japanese will be scared off by
this," said Paul Silverstein, an attorney for the dissident
bondholders who sought the new vote. He said the creditors he
represents hope to persuade other creditors that the cash and
notes being offered by the Japanese "should be enhanced."
   The dissident bondholders objected to the original vote on
Southland's reorganization plan because Southland "gave
minimal time" for creditors to consider the plan, said Mr.
Silverstein, of the New York law firm of Milgrim Thomajan &amp;
Lee.
   Michael Sutherland, an attorney for Southland, said the
company doesn't view the new vote as a "negative or a
setback." The new vote was ordered by Judge Harold Abramson
of Dallas.
   "This will give us a means to show {the judge} the broad
base of creditor support for the plan," said Mr. Sutherland,
a lawyer with the Houston-based firm of Vinson &amp; Elkins.
"This will help us to remove whatever doubt remains in his
mind."
   The company hasn't yet decided how the new vote will be
solicited. A hearing on the voting procedure is scheduled for
Thursday before Judge Abramson, according to Mr. Sutherland.
