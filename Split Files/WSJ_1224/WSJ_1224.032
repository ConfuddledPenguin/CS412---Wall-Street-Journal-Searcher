   NEW YORK -- It was the golden age of pajamas. "Thin Man"
detective William Powell shook up cocktails in his brocade
robe and silk pajamas. "Pajama Game" became a Broadway hit.
Wheelchair gumshoe James Stewart -- in pajamas -- solved a
murder out his rear window. And one long, rainy night, Clark
Gable shared his pajamas with Claudette Colbert.
   Then along came the Woodstock generation. It didn't
believe in wearing things to bed, and pajamas fell into
disrepute. During the 1960s and '70s, pajamas were regarded
as strictly for kids, for surgery or for Hugh Hefner. Pajamas
were as square as their boxy tops.

   Now pajamas are making a comeback. Baby boomers in their
cocoons like to lounge in clothes that feel good and don't
bind; and as an added incentive to cover up, their own babies
have reached staring age. Saddam Hussein also can take some
credit for the pajama renaissance. To keep heating bills down
some people are digging into their clothes drawers for those
unworn pajamas that well-meaning relatives once gave them.
   The popularity of pajamas has inspired Chicago's Planet
Cafe, which opened in 1988, to promote pajama parties.
Weekend customers who show up for breakfast in pajamas get
10% discounts on their meals. At times, says owner Todd
Revesz, as many as a third of the 30-seat cafe's patrons are
taking their breakfasts in "pajamas, granny gowns and even a
few nightcaps."
   In returning to pajamas, a generation has created new role
models and sex symbols. Superdad Bill Cosby wears pajamas. So
does Richard Gere -- navy, silk, and only the bottoms -- in
this year's hit movie "Pretty Woman."
   Other male actors, possibly in hope of being taken more
seriously, are often insisting on covering their chests in
bedroom scenes. These are "a lot more glamorous when the
woman is wearing a peignoir and the guy is wearing pajamas,"
says James Alvarez, manager of the wardrobe department for
NBC Television in Burbank, Calif. "Especially since now there
are more beautiful garments to choose from."
   The leading men of old might be shocked by some
contemporary pj's. If you're willing to spend $40 to $80 for
pajamas, you can find them emblazoned with just about
anything -- fried eggs, pink pigs or coffee pots. For lovers,
there's a set printed with "No]" that turns to "Yes]" when
the lights go out.
   New York restaurateur Thomas Baratta got used to sleeping
in undershirts in the service. He never planned to wear
pajamas again. Then he received a pair of flannel pajamas --
printed with dice and playing cards -- and became a convert.
Six of Mr. Baratta's friends will be receiving loud-print
pajamas this Christmas. "When I get home I can't wait to get
out of my clothes and into my pajamas," says Mr. Baratta.
   For the past few months, Elyse Salend, a Los Angeles
gerontologist, has been sleeping in a pair of cow-print
pajamas she bought to match the ones her husband received as
a present. "I wear the cow pajamas when I read bedtime
stories to my kids," says Ms. Salend, "and I feel, you know,
like `Father Knows Best.'"
   Indeed, pajamas seem so all-American -- Ozzie Nelson wore
his buttoned to the chin -- that it's hard to believe they
were first worn as street clothes, by the Hindus in India.
The Hindus called them pajamas. The colonial British took
them back to England in the 1870s for lounging and sleeping.
Only the wealthy could afford pajamas then, so the first ones
were made with drawstrings to accommodate the well-fed. By
1927, pajamas were popular enough in America to earn a place
in the Sears catalogue alongside the popular $1.39 muslin
nightshirt.
   Some sleep specialists believe they can improve the
quality of sleep. "Pajamas have a loose fit, and they feel
nice against your skin, so you won't stick to the sheets,"
says Dianne Hales, author of a 1987 book called "How to Sleep
like a Baby." She says, "As more people have become concerned
about their diet and exercise, they are also more focused on
how they sleep . . . thinking more about the beds they sleep
on, their sheets and their pajamas." Can Teddy Bears be far
behind?
   Bill Slevin, who wears pajamas every night, agrees that
when he dons a fresh pair of pajamas he feels "refreshed" and
sleeps better. Mr. Slevin has been selling pajamas at Brooks
Brothers in New York for 49 years and remembers selling silk
pajamas to Fred Astaire and outfitting numerous young boys on
their way to boarding school. For many years, pajamas played
a role in the hazing of new preppies at Phillips Exeter
Academy in Exeter, N.H. After the annual football game with
archrival Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., new Exeter
students had to put on their pajamas and parade through town
to a bonfire on the football field.
   The pajama game had been sleepy for years until the recent
pickup. But in 1989, Host Pajamas Inc., the nation's largest
pajama maker, reported an 11% jump in annual sales. Host
attributes the increase to buying by older people,
stay-at-homes and others attracted by new fashion prints.
Host now sells machine-washable silk pajamas under the
Christian Dior label for $125, as well as a number of
fluorescent and other loud-print styles.
   At prices that high, retailers have begun treating pajamas
a little more respectfully. More stores are taking them out
of plastic bags and putting them on hangers like regular
clothes. At Ralph Lauren's Madison Avenue store in New York,
$265 rayon pajamas hang on padded satin hangers. And flashy
pj's are turning up in more-unusual places, including the
Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles, where the
museum shop does a brisk business in pajamas with huge prints
of bronco-busting cowboys.
   Not everybody is back in pajamas, of course. Some men
still won't bother with them. They say they sleep just as
well in underwear or nothing at all. Henry Kravis, the king
of leveraged buy-outs, admits to having a couple of pairs of
pajamas around but not for sleeping. "I wear them only when
I'm sick," he says.
