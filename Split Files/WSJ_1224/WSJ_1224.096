   DETROIT -- Mazda Motor of America said it is raising the
base price of its 1991 Navajo sport utility vehicle by 1.6%
to $17,835. The auto maker said in September that the Navajo
would cost $17,560. Mazda said the price increase is at least
partly a result of the rising cost of doing business. The
price increase is effective for vehicles that arrive at
showrooms on or after Jan. 2, 1991.
