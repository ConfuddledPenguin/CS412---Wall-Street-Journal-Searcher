   NEW YORK -- K-III Holdings L.P. said it definitively
agreed with closely held Field Corp. to buy two educational
publishing subsidiaries, the children's book publishers Field
Publications and the encyclopedia publisher Funk &amp; Wagnalls.
   Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in
early 1991, weren't disclosed. But investment bankers
previously estimated the purchase price will be less than the
$300 million a year in sales for the two businesses combined.
