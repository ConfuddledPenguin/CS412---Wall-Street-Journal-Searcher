   The short-sellers are hanging crepe for News Corp. Again.
   Even as the media giant's shares continue to plumb new
lows, the company's critics keep betting the stock will fall
further still. The question is: How much of a decline is
enough? Isn't News Corp. a savvy buy at some point?

   Not if you believe the bears' growl.
   "News Corp. is so over-leveraged that it's likely to face
a bankruptcy-like reorganization," contends California's Joe
Feshbach of Feshbach Bros., a money-management firm that
invests over $1 billion and boasts a penchant for selling
short, or making a bet that share prices will decline.
Indeed, he argues, News Corp. already looks very much like an
insolvent company, given that it can't meet its cur rent
bank-loan obligations, needs a deferral of debt payments, and
is asking banks for $600 million in loans, adding to the
10.53 billion Australian dollars (US$8.14 billion) of debt
already burdening the company.
   Mr. Feshbach's firm began selling short a huge number of
News Corp. shares when the price of the company's American
depositary receipts had already dropped into single digits.
In a short sale, a bear sells borrowed shares in the hope the
stock will take a tumble, allowing him to return the shares
later at far lower prices. But Mr. Feshbach still hasn't
"covered" -- he thinks the stock is going to zero.
   Other short-sellers, believed to include George Soros's
Quantum Fund, James Chanos of Kynikos Associates Ltd., and
Rocker Partners Ltd., apparently agree. Even after News Corp.
ADRs hit a 52-week low of 6 5/8 last month, a mere fraction
of their high of 23 3/8 last January, the bears kept
shorting. They sold nearly 100,000 more borrowed shares in
the ensuing weeks leading up to mid-December, pushing the
overall amount of the stock sold short up 1.6% from the month
before, to a total of 6,266,555 ADRs.
   Triggered partly by a wave of short-selling, News Corp.
shares tumbled 20% on the Australian exchange on Thursday
alone; the company's ADRs, pounded on the New York Stock
Exchange, fell more than 5% the same day. The jitters were
caused by rumors that the British government, or perhaps the
Australian government, was about to pursue News Corp. for
back taxes of more than $1 billion -- what currency varies
with the rumor's source.
   In Big Board trading Friday, News Corp. ADRs closed at
$7.50 a share, unchanged.
   News Corp. officials counter: What's the worry? Debt talks
are going fine, and 95% of the more than 100 banks involved
have approved the new terms of a redone loan package, company
insiders say. If News Corp.'s chief executive officer, Rupert
Murdoch, can only reach a new lending agreement, to repay
US$1.4 billion by the end of 1993 instead of the US$6.8
billion that would be due under the existing pact, there will
be sufficient time to sell some assets at good prices without
holding a fire sale, the company argument goes.
   Bears scoff at such talk, citing the company's creaking
load of debt and the economic weakness in the U.S., Australia
and Britain. If News Corp.'s banks are smart to keep backing
the company, says Mr. Feshbach, how did they ever get in the
current mess? He notes that "one of our largest short
positions is one of News Corp.'s largest lenders --
Citicorp," which is leading the current renegotiation.
   News Corp., which had negative cash flow of A$873 million
in the fiscal year ended June 30, envisions positive cash
flow of A$104 million this fiscal year. But that projection
depends on logging a 25% increase in pretax earnings, to
A$1.73 billion, as recession looms and the media business
struggles world-wide.
   Bears call that projection a fantasy. They also point to a
number of apparent contradictions emanating from Mr. Murdoch,
who has a 45% stake.
   In October, for example, Mr. Murdoch told reporters and
analysts he would cut huge capital spending to A$400 million
in fiscal '91. A month later, company officials said spending
would be almost twice that, at A$740 million, insisting they
had never cited the earlier figure. Last April, this
newspaper quoted Mr. Murdoch in an interview saying that News
Corp. debt would rise US$400 million, to US$6.5 billion, by
June 1990, after sales of assets and the addition of
HarperCollins debt to the books. Debt instead hit a total of
A$10.53 billion and continues to climb. News Corp. executives
maintain the newspaper report was wrong, though they never
bothered to correct it.
   The problem, says one short-seller in New York, is that if
News Corp. does a belly-flop: "The banks are going to get
their money out before the shareholders do. That's why this
equity is worthless."
