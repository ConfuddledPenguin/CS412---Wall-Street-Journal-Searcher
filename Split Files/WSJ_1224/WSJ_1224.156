   Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, a tire maker, lowered its
forecasts for 1990 net income and consolidated sales.
   Bridgestone said 1990 profit will amount to 10 billion yen
($74.1 million), which is off 50% from the company's initial
prediction in March of 20 billion yen. Sales are expected to
reach 1.78 trillion yen ($13.19 billion), or 1.1% less than
the initial forecast of 1.8 trillion yen.

   In 1989, Bridgestone earned 9.6 billion yen on sales of
1.69 trillion yen.
   For its latest revision, Bridgestone cited soft market
conditions in North America and Europe, with weak customer
demand in the replacement-tire market and decreased new-auto
production. It said the lower forecasts also were prompted by
the suspension of natural rubber operations in Liberia, as a
result of that country's civil war, and increased production
costs owing to a rise in raw materials prices.
