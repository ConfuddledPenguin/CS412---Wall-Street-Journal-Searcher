   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A federal district court jury awarded
Stephens Inc. $1,380,000 in compensatory damages and $1
million in punitive damages in a fraud and conspiracy suit
that the Little Rock-based investment banking concern had
brought against Geldermann Inc., a Chicago commodity-futures
trading firm.
   The civil suit involved an alleged commodities trading
scheme operated from 1982 until 1987 by the late John Markle,
a former Stephens vice president who controlled a
futures-trading account at Geldermann for Stephens. Mr.
Markle was allegedly allowed to wait until the end of the
trading day to designate the fate of trades made through
Geldermann, with losses being assigned to Stephens and gains
to an account Mr. Markle had established for his mother,
Academy Award-winning actress Mercedes McCambridge, of San
Diego, Calif.

   Ms. McCambridge joined Stephen's suit against Geldermann
and sought $500,000 in compensatory and $1 million in
punitive damages. The jury awarded her nothing.
   Stephens had sought $6.2 million in compensatory damages
and an equal amount in punitive damages.
   During the three-week trial, Geldermann's attorneys argued
that Stephens contributed to its own losses by poorly
supervising Mr. Markle. Stephens countered that it didn't
learn of the scheme until Oct. 6, 1987. Stephens fired Mr.
Markle on Nov. 13, 1987. Three days later, the Little Rock
executive killed his wife, two daughters and himself,
authorities say.
