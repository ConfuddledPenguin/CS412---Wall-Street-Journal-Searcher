   David Willetts of the London Centre for Policy Studies
recalls his time working for Margaret Thatcher in the Dec. 1
issue of the London Spectator:

   I remember once asking for a Perrier water when she was
buying me a snack. She obviously regarded it as treachery to
drink a French product and asked why I wanted it. I explained
it was because it was naturally fizzy. She replied that the
bubbles were artificially added. We then started arguing
about whether the bubbles in Perrier were natural or not. . .
   A free marketeer would be horrified at her nationalistic
instincts. But as always there was a shrewd judgment
underlying them. British people are not going to be motivated
to be enterprising and accept painful economic changes in
pursuit of the vision of a free market, but they may do so if
they are told it is because we have to compete with the
French and the Germans. Maybe we are like schoolchildren who
can only be motivated by the desire to be top of the class
(or competing with foreigners) and not by the abstract idea
of being well educated (the true equivalent of prosperity).
