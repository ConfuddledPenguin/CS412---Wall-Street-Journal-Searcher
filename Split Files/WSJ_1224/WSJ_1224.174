   One of the late Prof. Paul Seabury's last great deeds was
to commission a small plane to fly over this year's Earth Day
parade in his hometown of Berkeley with a banner telling the
Mayor to forget radical politics and fix the potholes.
   Voters gave Mayor Loni Hancock much the same message this
past Election Day. Her radical-left allies on the City
Council and rent-control board were routed. But she has
apparently survived the bid by a moderate Democrat to oust
her, by about the narrowest margin conceivable.

   A trial-court judge blessed her 77-vote victory, even
though 386 absentee ballots remain uncounted. More than
35,000 votes were cast, with her challenger polling 60% among
the absentee ballots that were counted. But the uncounted
ballots arrived after Election Day, apparently because of a
delay processing applications, and Judge Howard Schwartz said
rules are rules.
   The rule in Berkeley city government for nearly two
decades has been relentless radicalism. The University of
California's mother campus has mellowed back into a bastion
of studiousness, where the only major political strife
involves admissions policies that seem to keep out qualified
Asian-Americans. But the town astride Telegraph Avenue struck
the usual sistercity arrangements with revolutionary
communists, and sponsored various festivals and exhibits of
zoology.
   What's really hurt the community has been draconian rent
control, enforced to protect a favored class of barnacle
renters familiar to college towns. The law reduced liquidity
in the housing market, hurt students, and exacted a punitive
tax on small landlords, many of them black.
   Berkeley is on its way to overcoming the entrenched left,
though the symbolic Mayor may remain, holed up like the czar
in his winter palace. Our departed friend Paul Seabury would
be amused.
