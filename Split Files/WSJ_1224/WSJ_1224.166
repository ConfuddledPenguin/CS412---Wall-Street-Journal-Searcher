   WASHINGTON -- Massive Western aid won't help the Soviet
Union until it takes rapid and radical steps toward a market
economy, according to a study by the leading Western economic
organizations.
   The new report provides the first thorough Western
snapshot of the Soviet economy, and the image that emerges
looks more like Mexico than the U.S. Estimated annual income
per capita in the Soviet Union, at $1,780 a year, is about
10% of the $17,606 average income per person for Western
industrialized nations and trails even the $2,465 average in
Eastern Europe.

   These figures imply that total Soviet output is little
more than $500 billion, or about 10% of that of the U.S. If
true, many past estimates that accepted the official Soviet
valuation of the ruble -- including those of the Central
Intelligence Agency -- have greatly exaggerated the size and
wealth of the Soviet economy.
   The grim assessment predicts that Soviet national output,
excluding services, declined 4% in 1990, and assuming present
policies persist, is set to shrink 5% or more in 1991.
Inflation may be as much as 40% next year, and the nation
also has to cope with as much as $12 billion of its long-term
foreign debt falling due at a time when its commercial
creditors are increasingly reluctant to lend.
   "The traditional centrally planned system has largely
collapsed, but hasn't been replaced by a functioning market
system," the study says. To improve the situation, the study
advocates a decisive and irreversible program that includes
liberalization of prices and the establishment of property
rights. The economy also requires "an early and effective
clarification of the responsibilities between the union and
the republics," as well as far-reaching legal changes to
provide the basis for a complete refashioning of the Soviet
economy.
   The report should therefore provide some support for
reformers in the Soviet Union, who are on the defensive
following the resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze last week.
   The 2,000-page study, a 50-page summary of which was
released Friday, was commissioned at the Houston economic
summit last summer partly to settle a dispute between the
U.S. and some European Community leaders over aid to the
Soviets. The Europeans, particularly the Germans and French,
were eager to rush large amounts of aid to Moscow, but the
U.S. argued for a more cautious approach.
   If anything, the report -- prepared by the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development -- is a vindication of holding
back substantial aid until there is much more commitment to
reform.
   The Soviets have expressed interest in joining these four
organizations and other Western bodies, and the study is
expected to form a basis for the Soviets' continuing
discussions with these agencies. In recent days, the U.S.
suggested the Soviet Union apply for special associate status
with the IMF, which could lead to full membership.
   The new study does advocate some immediate but limited
Western help for the Soviet Union: substantial technical
assistance, particularly to help with formulating policy,
building Western-style institutions and a new legal
framework; carefully supervised humanitarian food aid,
especially to alleviate shortages in big cities; and some
well-monitored financing of selected projects. And, it says,
larger support could play a useful role once the country is
firmly committed to a market economy and private ownership.
   For the Soviet economy, the report generally advocates
orthodox Western economic policies, such as cutting the
bloated budget deficit -- expected to total 8.5% of output in
1990. Moderate credit expansion, firm wage and price
controls, and a more sustainable balance-of-payments policy
also are essential. A progressive opening up to foreign
competition and investment also is needed, along with a
realistic unified exchange rate, full convertibility of the
ruble and careful management of foreign debt.
   The 1990 current-account deficit, excluding gold, is
estimated at almost $11 billion, the study says. Exports of
gold, which are close to annual production levels, are
expected to net almost $4 billion in 1990.
   Soviet foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5 billion
this year, from $14.7 billion in 1989, as the country
financed itself by drawing down reserves and getting behind
in its payments by as much as $5 billion. Declining
international confidence led to a cut of $9.5 billion in
foreign lines of credit, particularly short-term credits.
Altogether, foreign debt declined to $52.2 billion from $54
billion, as reserves were liquidated to make up for reduced
foreign credit.
   The study's statistics on the Soviet Union are similar to
those of Argentina or some other big developing nation.
Proportionate to the population, the Soviet Union has only a
quarter of the telephone lines of Western Europe and
one-eighth the number of passenger cars. Fifteen million
Soviets are on the waiting list for a telephone. Eighteen
percent of all Soviet families have been on waiting lists for
housing for more than 10 years, and average per-capita living
space is less than half that in Western Europe. Price
subsidies account for more than 10% of gross domestic
product.
   Life is no better on the Soviet farm. Twenty percent of
the Soviet wheat crop is lost through waste and inefficiency,
compared with a loss of 2% of the wheat crop in the U.S.
Spoilage and loss of fruit and vegetables run as high as 40%
of the crop. Altogether losses in food production cost the
Soviet Union about $20 billion a year, a sum equal to the
value of the nation's annual food imports. Meanwhile, milk
yields per cow are half those in the EC and 40% of those in
the U.S.
   Nevertheless, the Soviet Union has vast natural resources
and formidable potential, as the study recognizes. It already
accounts for 22% of world oil output and 40% of world gas
output, and is the world's largest producer of iron ore, zinc
and nickel, and the second-biggest producer of gold and
aluminum.
