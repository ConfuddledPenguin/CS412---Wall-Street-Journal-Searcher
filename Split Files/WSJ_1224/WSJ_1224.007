   A judge's ruling that Paramount Pictures Corp. forced
writer Art Buchwald into an "unconscionable" fee agreement
marks one of the few times a court has thrown out a standard
movie contract. It is expected to shake the Hollywood studio
hierarchy and its decades-old system of net-profit deal
making.
   California Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider
ordered the Paramount Communications Inc. unit to abandon its
usual method of cost accounting when it determines how much
money it owes Mr. Buchwald and an independent producer, Alain
Bernheim, for their work on the film "Coming to America." The
studio, which produced and distributed the 1988 hit starring
Eddie Murphy, must instead pay them a "fair and reasonable"
share, which the judge will determine after hearing more
evidence.

   Mr. Buchwald and Mr. Bernheim signed a contract that
included a definition of net profits that has become standard
in the industry. Paramount contended that the movie fell $18
million short of reaching the point at which these net
profits would kick in, even though the film had grossed more
than $300 million world-wide. Of that, Paramount's own share
of the revenue is about $150 million.
   In a strongly worded 36-page opinion, Judge Schneider said
the "net-profits formula as written no longer exists."
   Mr. Buchwald said he expects his suit to "change
Hollywood's accounting system." The decision could have broad
implications for most people who negotiate movie deals with
big studios. Only a handful of Hollywood's most powerful
actors, directors and independent producers are able to
demand a share of gross earnings. Traditionally, artists who
didn't have "the clout to make a better deal," according to
the judge's opinion, signed boilerplate provisions for a
share of net profit, which often failed to materialize.
   In the Buchwald deal, the judge struck down as "overly
harsh" and "one-sided" Paramount's deductions for overhead
and interest on overhead that bore no relation to the
company's actual costs.
   "If I were a studio lawyer right now, I'd have my standard
contract in one hand and the judge's decision in the other,
and I'd be revising it right now," said Pierce O'Donnell, a
Los Angeles lawyer for the Buchwald-Bernheim team.
   The decision drew sharp criticism from the studio and some
members of the movie industry. "If this ruling stands,
virtually every commercial contract would be subject to being
rewritten by the courts at the insistence of a party who felt
that the agreement was not as advantageous as he would have
liked," Paramount said in a statement.
   "This is a disaster that will change the entertainment
business permanently and irreversibly," said Peter Dekom, a
Los Angeles entertainment lawyer. He predicted that hundreds
of writers and producers will sue studios for new accountings
of profits. The ensuing "legal nightmare," Mr. Dekom said,
will provoke a backlash by studios, which could simply
abandon any pretense of net-profit participation and resort
to flat, up-front payments.
   "Individuals with low bargaining power are likely to be
hurt because the studio won't want to take the risk they are
going to sue," he said.
   An executive at another major Hollywood studio said that
if the judge's ruling is upheld on appeal, movies will be
more expensive to make because artists will demand a greater
share of the profit.
   Charles P. Diamond, a lawyer for the studio, vowed to
appeal. "This judge thinks he is free to rewrite economic
terms that willing buyers and sellers agreed to," he said.
   Several talent agents said that in the wake of the ruling
they are likely to seek more favorable terms from studios for
their clients.
   Earlier this year, Judge Schneider ruled that "Coming to
America" was based on an idea by Mr. Buchwald, who wrote a
brief synopsis but didn't receive screen credit. Mr. Murphy
had said that he co-wrote the script with talk-show host
Arsenio Hall.
   Messrs. Buchwald and Bernheim's contract stipulated that
they were entitled to a fee of about $250,000 and about 41%
of the film's net profit as defined in the contract if
Paramount made the movie and Mr. Bernheim was the producer.
"Coming to America" was one of the top 20 grossing films of
the 1980s.

   ENVIRONMENTAL decision appears to conflict with federal
appellate ruling.
   A Maryland state judge ruled that Utica Mutual Insurance
Co. must pay cleanup costs at a former Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc.
facility in Sparks, Md.
   This is the first such ruling in Maryland in an
environmental cleanup case. Defense lawyers said the case is
significant because Judge John F. Fader II of Baltimore
County Circuit Court refused to follow a 1987 federal appeals
court decision involving Armco Inc. In that case, the appeals
court ruled that Armco's insurer wasn't liable for the costs
of a cleanup at an Armco site.
   "Because federal courts are required to follow state
courts on interpretations of state law, Judge Fader's ruling
undermines the Armco decision," said Jordan Stanzler, a
lawyer with the New York firm Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky
who represented Bausch &amp; Lomb. Mr. Stanzler said the Armco
ruling is cited frequently by insurers in environmental
disputes.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb, based in Rochester, N.Y., operated the
optical instruments facility in Sparks from 1965 to 1987.
Groundwater contamination on the site was discovered in 1985.
The cost of the cleanup isn't known.
   Judge Fader ruled that under Maryland law the cost of
cleaning environmental contamination is covered under Bausch
&amp; Lomb's insurance policies. But the judge said the insurer
doesn't have to pay the cost of investigating the nature of
the contamination at the site. Judge Fader, who ruled from
the bench following a two-week trial, hasn't issued a written
opinion.
   Lawyers for the Utica, N.Y., insurer said that Judge
Fader's ruling chips away at the Armco decision but doesn't
undermine it entirely.
   Thomas Brunner, a lawyer with the Washington firm Wiley,
Rein &amp; Fielding, which represents Utica, said Judge Fader's
ruling was a victory for insurers on other issues. He said
the company will appeal the part of the ruling dealing with
the Armco decision.

   FDIC PLANS to appeal decision barring it from filing new
claims against Drexel.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Francis Conrad rejected the
agency's request for more time to seek additional damages
from Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. Drexel filed for
bankruptcy-law protection last February.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. already has sued
Drexel for $6.8 billion in damages for alleged thrift losses
caused by Drexel junk-bond transactions. Although the
deadline for filing claims against Drexel was Nov. 15, the
FDIC says it needs more time to investigate thrifts that have
failed since then.
   "It is clear that this agency has a duty and obligation
and a mandate from Congress to pursue fully all avenues of
recovery," said Alfred J.T. Byrne, general counsel for the
FDIC. He said the agency plans to appeal Judge Conrad's
decision.
   The FDIC had asked Judge Conrad to give it until Feb. 13
to file additional claims. But Mr. Byrne said the agency
isn't ruling out seeking an even broader extension. At a
hearing Thursday, Thomas Barr, an attorney for the agency,
said that after a thrift fails, the FDIC should be given 60
days to investigate whether a claim should be filed against
Drexel.
   Mr. Byrne also defended the size of the FDIC's claims,
which Drexel has described as exaggerated and politically
motivated. "We are very serious. We have done our homework,"
Mr. Byrne said. "We haven't asserted damages for any amount
more or less than we think we are entitled to recover."
   Drexel says granting the FDIC the chance to file new
claims will only delay the company's efforts to reorganize.

   FEDERAL COURTS in seven states will allow cameras in the
courtroom.
   U.S. district courts in parts of Indiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington will take part in a
three-year pilot program. The federal court in Manhattan
announced last week that it was selected as well by a
nationwide committee of federal judges. Cameras also will be
permitted in the federal appeals courts in Manhattan and San
Francisco.
   Only civil cases will be involved. Although cameras are
allowed in most state courtrooms, they are currently
prohibited in all federal courts.
   The federal program will begin July 1, and strict
guidelines have been issued for camera use. Picture-taking of
jurors, for instance, won't be allowed. And only one still
camera and one video camera will be allowed at a time.

   EAGLE-PICHER names three attorneys in civil RICO suit.
   The former asbestos maker based in Cincinnati alleges
"malicious prosecution" by three lawyers involved in an
effort earlier this month to put Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.
into involuntary bankruptcy.
   The bankruptcy petition, filed by Cincinnati attorney
Norman Slutsky, was on behalf of three plaintiffs who
objected to the class action settlement terms reached in
federal court in New York on behalf of 175,000 asbestos
claimants against Eagle-Picher. A bankruptcy-law filing
automatically stays all other legal action against the
debtor's property.
   The case was dismissed within 24 hours at Mr. Slutsky's
request because at least one -- and possibly two -- of the
plaintiffs didn't have standing to press the complaint, Mr.
Slutsky said. Mr. Slutsky, who wasn't named in Eagle-Picher's
suit, said he was provided inaccurate information by one of
the attorneys named in the complaint, Ronald Motley, of South
Carolina. Mr. Motley couldn't be reached for comment.
   The other attorneys named in the suit, filed in federal
court in Cincinnati, are Frederick Baron and Brent Rosenthal
of Dallas.
   The lawyers said they weren't actively involved in filing
the suit and that the RICO case is a blatant attempt to
intimidate them for opposing Eagle-Picher's class action
settlement.
