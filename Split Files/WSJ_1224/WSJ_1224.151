   NEW YORK -- State officials filed suit against a
Beneficial Corp. consumer finance subsidiary for allegedly
using a "predatory and deceptive" scheme to get borrowers.
   The unit, Beneficial New York Inc., denied the charges.
"We're confident we're within New York state regulations,"
said Robert Wade, a company spokesman. "I can't say anything
beyond that because I haven't seen the complaint," he added.

   The suit, filed in state supreme court in Rochester,
charges that Beneficial mailed unsolicited checks to
consumers around the state for up to $1,500, urging they be
cashed immediately.
   According to Attorney General Robert Abrams and Banking
Superintendent Jill Considine, the documents Beneficial
mailed to consumers stated that by cashing the check they
agreed to repay the loan. State officials charge that
Beneficial deceived customers by calling the interest
payments on the loan "low," when in practice the rates
charged would be 25%. Under New York state law the maximum
rate allowed is 25%, or about double most conventional bank
loans.
   Mr. Abrams said he is asking the court to suspend
repayment of the loans and to bar Beneficial from continuing
its marketing campaign.
   The Beneficial spokesman said the company would wait to
see the complaint before it decided on a course of action.
