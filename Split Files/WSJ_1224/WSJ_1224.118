   Ameritech said it reached a definitive agreement to
acquire Knowledge Data Systems Inc. for $26 million, or 94
cents a share.
   Under the agreement, Chicago-based Ameritech will start a
cash tender offer before next Monday. Knowledge Data and
certain shareholders granted Ameritech an option to buy up to
40% of the shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis at the
same price.

   Knowledge Data, based in San Francisco, provides data
processing systems and related services to health-care
institutions and medical laboratories.
   After the tender offer is completed, which is expected by
the end of January, Knowledge Data will operate as a unit of
Ameritech Information Systems.
