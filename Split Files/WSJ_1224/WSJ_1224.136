   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said that it
received regulatory approval to begin trading broiler-chicken
futures contracts.
   The exchange said it expects to begin trading the
contracts, each of which represent 40,000 pounds of broilers,
on Feb. 7, 1991.

<TEXT>
   A previous version faded into dormancy in 1982 because
traders were frustrated with its cumbersome delivery
provisions. To fix that, the Merc devised a contract that
doesn't require physical delivery of the underlying broilers.
   Instead, the new contract will use an unusual cash
settlement system based on the Agriculture Department's
12-city average price report on Grade A broilers.
   Contracts will be traded for delivery in February, April,
May, June, July, August, October and December.
   As approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the speculative limit is 2,000 broiler contracts in all
contract months combined. Speculators are limited to 500
contracts in any specific contract month.
   The exchange slashed its original proposal for a
speculative limit of an enormous 10,000 contracts in all
trading months combined after the CFTC raised questions.
   The CFTC is still considering a Merc proposal to trade
options on the broiler futures contracts.
