   The first flakes of freezing snow fell on Warsaw's streets
this month, covering the city's ubiquitous street traders
with a light dusting of white. Undeterred, merchants of carp
and caviar, toy trains and bicycles, shampoo, breakfast
cereals and bubble-gum kept hawking their wares beneath
colored umbrellas as the snow turned to rain. Muddied foreign
cars, whose numbers have multiplied in recent months, huddled
near the vendors. No one stands in lines here anymore. The
idea is to park (illegally), to shop (quickly) and to go
home.
   Warsaw was a very different city at this time last year,
and Poland was a very different country. Nothing has been the
same since the inauguration of Poland's Big Bang economic
reform on Jan. 1, when the economic team of exiting Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki cut subsidies, freed prices,
loosened trade restrictions, raised interest rates and froze
wages.

   The street traders, the new entrepreneurship and the new
cars are the visible side effects of this tight monetary and
fiscal regime, which has won Poland the applause of the
International Monetary Fund and the international financial
community. No one has watched the transformation more
carefully than the Soviet Union, which is considering a
similar reform.
   But if you believe statistics, the Polish anti-inflation
program -- known as the Balcerowicz Plan after Polish Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz -- has also caused Polish
production to drop by 30%, forced Polish living standards
down by 40%, and bumped unemployment to one million from
zero. If you believe many Western assessments of Poland's
recent elections, these harsh side effects were also
responsible for the results, in which Poles voted Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa into power, rejected Mr. Mazowiecki and
propelled Polish-Canadian businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, who
promised instant prosperity and wealth "within one month" of
his election, into second place.
   Neither the statistics nor the analyses are correct. To
begin with, all the estimates of falling production, which
became easy targets during the election campaign, are based
on comparisons with old communist estimates, which often bore
little relation to reality. Production figures were skewed in
the past both by over-optimistic estimation on the part of
factory directors looking for promotions, and by the fact
that "production" included the production of junk that no one
ever purchased. A drop in production of ill-fitting shoes or
worthless machinery does not necessarily represent an
economic disaster. This is particularly true -- unfortunately
-- because the Polish economic reform is far from finished.
   A real restructuring of state industry -- through mass
privatization for example -- has yet to happen. Nor is the
banking system yet capable of adhering to the financial
discipline necessary for widespread bankruptcies.
   At the same time, unemployment statistics were disrupted
by the fact that "unemployment," as such, was formerly not a
statistical category at all. People who remained on payrolls
but did no work, as well as people who could not or would not
find jobs, were simply not registered anywhere on any list.
   The new legions of officially registered unemployed, as
any local government official will freely admit, are mostly
either people who never held jobs before or people who work
in the unregistered, untaxed street markets and other sectors
of the black economy. Meanwhile, jobs for masons, carpenters,
plumbers and mechanics go unfilled week after week, despite
newspaper ads that can only be described as pleading. After
10 weeks of running ads, one man looking for a carpenter to
do household woodwork ended up importing a "guest worker"
from Lithuania. Real unemployment may well be just around the
corner, but it hasn't arrived yet.
   Even estimates of living standards fall into similar
traps. In the past, figures for real wages were based on
calculations of what people could theoretically buy in shops
that were, in reality, empty. New figures don't quantify the
happiness gained from the absence of long lines in food
shops, and the availability of products, like kiwi fruit,
that were absent before.
   Those who say the elections show reform has sped along too
fast are wrong. They are, however, right when they say Poles
are more worried than they used to be. One new element of
life is painfully real: fear of the future. Suddenly, people
see things in shops that they cannot afford to buy. Suddenly,
they are told that their state-subsidized cradle-to-grave
welfare programs will be dismantled, that their jobs are no
longer guaranteed.
   Citizens of the capitalist world accept these facts of
life, and know that possibilities of improvement and
expansion exist alongside a degree of uncertainty. Many Poles
feel only the fear. There is no major unemployment yet, but
there might be. They may not be starving yet, but when Mr.
Tyminski tells them that soon they will be living on the
streets, people have no reason not to believe it. By shouting
"the Balcerowicz Plan has destroyed Poland; things will get
worse, not better" into a microphone at his electoral
meetings, Mr. Tyminski managed to whip crowds into something
bordering panic.
   Fear was the reason for his success.
   In this touchy political situation, the last thing Poland
needs is slower economic reform, a return to the empty shops
and subsidies of the old days. That is something Lech Walesa,
for all his inconsistencies, appears to understand. The theme
of his campaign was Przyspieszenia, or "Acceleration." Faster
reform is the only way out, and most of all faster
privatization -- the mass sale of Poland's industry, still
nearly 90% state-owned. The capitalist life is a more
difficult life; people have to be bribed to accept it.
Privatization schemes that give people free shares in former
state enterprises that might have a hard time finding
outright buyers are one potential sweetener.
   Better business conditions at the lowest levels,
specifically lower taxes, are also necessary. The national
insurance tax, Poland's equivalent of Social Security, claims
45% of wages. Streamlining administrative procedures (legally
registering a new company can take up to six months) and
hurrying vital business legislation through Parliament could
also help give more people more options and open up untapped
sources of ingenuity. Poles are now known as Europe's
traders. They travel nearly everywhere, buying and selling
nearly everything along the way. Yet bureaucracy still
strangles such activity at home.
   Watching the street, and the opening of new shops and
restaurants, we see things have changed. Now the question is
how much more can change, and how fast. An oil crisis looms,
and an international recession could slow foreign investment
to a trickle. Much painful restructuring is still to come.
Many Poles know this, and when they voted for Lech Walesa and
his "acceleration" campaign theme they hoped they were voting
for this kind of faster change, moving toward capitalism as
before.
