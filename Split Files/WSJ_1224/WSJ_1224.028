   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Co. said it halted
discussions about a possible business combination with Alta
Gold Co. of Salt Lake City. The mining concerns agreed in
October to consider a combination, such as a merger or a
joint venture, of their businesses, Hecla said, but decided
not to proceed with such a deal.
