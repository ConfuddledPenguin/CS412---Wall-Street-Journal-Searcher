   NEW YORK -- Spooked by the recession and the Mideast
crisis, many growth-stock managers are cowering behind a pile
of cash, anxiously awaiting the next piece of bad news.
   Not Robert Chesek. He plunged back into the stock market
almost three months ago, and reckons stocks will post healthy
gains in 1991.

   "We're more optimistic than we have been in a long time,"
he says. "People are talking about failures in the banking
system and war in the Mideast. Nobody's looking past the next
quarter."
   Mr. Chesek isn't exactly a well-known money manager. But
his views are worth considering, for he has one of the best
10-year performance records in the mutual fund industry.
   Mr. Chesek's fund, Phoenix Growth Fund, has returned 17.5%
a year over the 10 years through November. Only four funds
have better records: Merrill Lynch Pacific at 21.8% a year,
Fidelity Magellan with 20.5%, Japan Fund with 18.6% and
Lindner Dividend with 17.5%.
   Mr. Chesek, 56 years old, works for the investment
advisory subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based Phoenix Mutual
Life Insurance Co. He has run Phoenix Growth, which charges a
6.9% sales commission on new purchases, since 1980. Earlier
this year, Catherine Dudley joined him as a co-portfolio
manager of the fund.
   What's Mr. Chesek's secret? Like many other growth-stock
managers, he looks for stocks with earnings momentum. He
likes companies whose profits have grown faster than the
average company over the prior 12 months and should continue
to grow rapidly over at least the next year.
   But to make sure he's not paying too much for that growth,
Mr. Chesek looks to see how a company's projected five-year
earnings growth rate compares with its current stock price.
For Mr. Chesek, a company whose earnings are expected to grow
at 20% a year is a bargain at 18 times trailing 12-month
earnings. At the same time, he reckons a company whose
earnings will plod along at a 7% annual growth rate is pricey
at 13 times earnings.
   Mr. Chesek usually won't buy into a company unless it is
clearly on the fast track. "We typically wait until the
earnings momentum has started," he says.
   Often Mr. Chesek owns a stock right up until the day it
announces disappointing earnings. "The difference between an
amateur and a professional is that a professional panics
first," he says. Earlier this year, for instance, the fund
dumped Browning-Ferris Industries when it reported
disappointing earnings for the three months through
September.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Chesek's stock-picking style
involves some rapid-fire trading. During the 1980s, his fund
had average portfolio turnover of 175%, against 79% for the
average stock fund. That means Mr. Chesek typically held onto
a stock for a little less than seven months, compared with 15
months for the average fund manager.
   This rapid turnover isn't so unusual for a growth stock
manager. What distinguishes Mr. Chesek's stock-picking style
is his willingness to raise cash when he reckons the market
might tumble, and his use of long-term themes to help him
select stocks.
   Right now, for instance, Mr. Chesek is trying to find
companies that will prosper because of the aging of America.
His $730 million fund is 17% invested in drug stocks such as
Pfizer and Amgen. He also reckons that entertainment, travel
and financial services companies should benefit as baby
boomers grow older.
   Mr. Chesek's long-term record has been helped by two
well-timed switches into cash. In 1987, nervous about rising
interest rates, Mr. Chesek boosted his fund's cash position,
so that he was only 60% invested in stocks at the time of the
October 1987 crash. Phoenix Growth finished the year up
11.2%, while the average fund eked out a gain of just 0.6%.
(These figures are total returns, which include both
share-price changes and dividends.)
   This year, worried that rising inflation might keep
interest rates high, he dodged into cash once again, so that
his fund was only 70% invested in stocks when the market
began slipping in mid-July. But in late September and early
October, he clambered back into the stock market, just in
time for the recent rebound.
   These astute moves, combined with healthy gains from the
fund's drug stocks and its holdings of multinationals such as
PepsiCo, Philip Morris and Unilever N.V., have ensured that
the fund will outpace the stock market for the eighth time in
10 years. So far this year, Phoenix Growth is up 5.7%,
against a decline of 6.8% for the average fund tracked by
Lipper Analytical Services.
   A big reason for Mr. Chesek's current optimism is the
decline in short-term interest rates. "Historically, any time
shortterm interest rates start coming down, it's been good
for equities," he says.
   Though Mr. Chesek is a growth-stock manager, he isn't
averse to buying relatively slow-growing industries,
providing they trade at a low enough multiple of earnings.
Right now, he is betting that high dividend-yielding utility
stocks such as Houston Industries, Idaho Power and Wisconsin
Public Service will get a boost from falling interest rates.
   "If you look at our utilities, the average yield is 8%,"
says Mr. Chesek. "If you're disenchanted with the yield on
your money market fund, your next step might be to buy a
utility."
   Mr. Chesek also likes top insurance companies such as
American International Group, Chubb and General Re Corp. All
are trading at 13 times earnings or less, and the fund is
betting that profits at these companies will grow 13% to 15%
annually over the next five years.
   Mr. Chesek thinks the companies that make up the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-stock index might earn $30 a share in 1992, up
from $21.75 for the latest 12 months. Put a 15 multiple on
that, he says, and you get the S&amp;P 500-stock index up at 450.
That would represent a 36% rise from current levels.
   "I think 1991 will be a pretty good year, and it will
continue through 1992," says Mr. Chesek. "Then we'll probably
overdo the damn thing, and we'll have a correction."
   But whatever happens to the market, don't expect Mr.
Chesek to sit tight with his current stock portfolio. He will
happily hang onto his utilities and his insurers and his drug
stocks, but only as long as the earnings keep coming through
and the stock prices don't get too rich. Says Mr. Chesek,
"I'd rather love my family than love my stocks."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The stock market ended narrowly mixed with market averages
holding to slim gains -- enough to preserve a 1.5% rise for
the week in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   Friday's "triple witching hour" -- when stock index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks
expire simultaneously-boosted share prices at the opening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 14 points in the
first minutes of trading.
   But another round of expirations in the afternoon failed
to lift stocks. In the final hour of trading, the Dow
industrials slid from a 15-point gain to close just 4.20
points higher at 2633.66.
   Aside from the expiration-related trading, which bloated
volume to 233,400,000 shares, activity was listless, traders
said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index added 1.63 to 331.75;
the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.55 to
180.87; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 1.22 to
307.17. Declining stocks on the Big Board edged out gainers,
793 to 773.
   For the week, the Dow industrials gained 39.85 points. The
S&amp;P 500 also added 1.5% for the week, while the Big Board's
composite index rose 1.2% and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 1.4%.
   A weak profit projection wiped out nearly half of Systems
Center's market value Friday. The stock plunged 4 1/2 to 4
7/8 after the company said Friday morning that fourth-quarter
operating earnings will be between five and 30 cents a share,
considerably lower than market expectations of 50 cents to $1
a share. The company, which develops and markets software for
International Business Machines mainframes and other systems,
earned 68 cents a share in the 1989 fourth quarter.
   USF&amp;G topped the most active list on volume of about 4.3
million shares, dipping 1/4 to 7 5/8 in dividend-related
trading.
   Merck jumped 1 1/2 to 87 5/8. The company disclosed that
it has developed a novel type of drug for fighting the AIDS
virus, and that it started pilot tests of the drug in humans
last month.
   General Electric won an important competition over rival
United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney unit to design the
engine for Japan's controversial FSX fighter plane, The Wall
Street Journal reported. GE added 1/2 to 58, while United
Technologies closed unchanged at 47 7/8.
   AMR fell 3/4 to 49 3/4. The Justice Department said it
would review a proposed $625 million deal between Trans World
Airlines and AMR's American Airlines unit to determine
whether the sale of international routes and airport
facilities would violate antitrust laws.
   Meanwhile, UAL, which will compete with AMR on routes to
London, gained 2 1/4 to 112 1/2. United agreed in October to
buy most of Pan Am's London routes for $400 million.
   Smith Barney upgraded several paper and forest product
stocks Friday, and suggested investors overweight large
diversified portfolios with the group. Boise Cascade, which
leaped to the top of the mostactive list earlier in the
session on dividend-related trading, gained 1 3/8 to 27 5/8.
   Westvaco rose 1 1/8 to 27 1/4 and James River increased
7/8 to 26 1/4. Among other paper shares, International Paper
added 3/8 to 53 1/2, Temple-Inland rose 3/4 to 31 1/4, and
Scott Paper gained 1 1/2 to 37 3/4.
   EG&amp;G dropped 1 3/4 to 32 3/4. Late Thursday it said
fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than previously
anticipated.
   Halliburton dropped 7/8 to 43 3/4. After the market closed
Thursday, Halliburton said the Internal Revenue Service had
notified the company that it might have underpaid its federal
corporate income taxes for the years 1980 through 1986 by as
much as $247 million, excluding interest. The company is
disputing the allegation, claiming it is owed a $115 million
refund.
   NCNB slipped 1/4 to 25 3/8. The company said it will add
about $180 million to $190 million to its loan-loss provision
in the fourth quarter, which could cut earnings to the
24-to-34-cent-a-share range, compared with net income of
$1.30 a share a year earlier.
   Black &amp; Decker eased 3/8 to 10 1/8. Late Thursday, the
company said business conditions in Brazil have deteriorated
and U.S. sales have been below expectations in the fourth
quarter, which the company said will result in
lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter.
   The American Stock Exchange Index fell 0.29 to 306.20. The
average price per share was unchanged.
