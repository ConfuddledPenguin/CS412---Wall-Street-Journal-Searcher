   NEW YORK -- The bond market is slipping into a year-end
lull that could put the recent price rally temporarily on
hold, though many people expect bonds to resume climbing
early next year.
   "In the near term, the market contains a little
uncertainty because of political issues, end-of-year
pressures and because of supply," said Donald Fine, market
strategist at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp. "But if you look
further out, inflation is abating and the U.S. economy is
weak -- and that is a prescription for lower bond yields."

   Last week, a bond market setback pushed up yields on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to 8.28% on Friday from a
low of just over 8% at the start of the week. Still, Mr. Fine
believes that yields on the benchmark bond will move as low
as 7 3/4% within a few months.
   This week, a time when many investors are on vacation and
have closed out their year-end books, the market is bracing
for a large new supply of securities. Yields often rise ahead
of big bond auctions, and the pattern is more pronounced at
yearend, as dealers mark down prices to clear away older
inventory.
   The Treasury is scheduled to sell $12.5 billion of
two-year notes on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Treasury will
auction four-year notes for the last time, selling about $8.5
billion of the securities. The Treasury will replace the
monthly four-year note auction with five-year note auctions.
   In addition, the government will sell as much as $7
billion of 30-year bonds for Resolution Trust Corp. in early
January. The RTC is the federal agency created to rescue the
nation's troubled savings and loan industry.
   Moreover, new government statistics suggest that the
Treasury will be forced to sharply boost the size of its bond
auctions next year to fund a burgeoning federal budget
deficit. On Friday, the Treasury said the federal deficit for
the first two months of fiscal year 1991 was $79.5 billion,
up from $55.82 billion for the first two months of fiscal
year 1990. The budget deficit for the entire 1990 fiscal
year, which ended in September, was $220.39 billion.
   "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out
we're on a trajectory for a $300 billion deficit" for fiscal
1992, said Stephen Slifer, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
So far, at least, a big increase in the supply of bonds has
been accommodated by investors, who, jarred by the weakening
economy, have been seeking a safe haven in U.S. Treasury
debt.
   Last week's slippage in bond prices followed a nearly
13-week surge that pushed prices of the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond 11 points higher, which translates into a gain
of about $110 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   Analysts said money managers are worried that a number of
political and technical trends will develop that could put
downward pressure on prices. Rather than risk losing a
portion of the tidy gains they've made in the past several
months, many are selling to reap their profits.
   "Nobody wants to take any risk at the end of the year,"
said F. Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone &amp;
McCarthy Research Associates. "Investors are more interested
in having their balance sheets look the way they want them to
look when the year-end snapshot is taken." He expects trading
activity to slow to a crawl during the holidays.
   One big fear is what Lawrence Leuzzi, a trading manager at
S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., calls the "countdown to conflict."
   He said that when investors return from the Christmas and
New Year's holidays they are likely to focus on the Jan. 15
deadline that the United Nations set for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait without being forced out militarily. "Investors
will be cautious until either something is resolved in the
Middle East or until that deadline is passed," said Mr.
Leuzzi.
   War fears grew deeper last week. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney told U.S. troops on Friday that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein "is not getting the message" and that it seems
increasingly likely that the U.S. will have to use force to
drive Iraq from Kuwait. Investors worry that armed conflict
in the Persian Gulf could hurt oil supplies, triggering a
rise in oil prices and inflation. Turmoil in the Soviet Union
also could hurt note and bond prices.
   "All of these things bring forth uncertainty, and in
uncertain environments, bond yields rise a bit," said Chase's
Mr. Fine. "But if you ask me where bond yields will be in the
next few months, they will be lower."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices ended sharply lower, pressured by war worries,
a deluge of new debt expected this week and a growing federal
budget deficit.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
105, down 5/8 point from 105 20/32 on Thursday. The issue's
yield, which moves counter to its price, rose to 8.27% from
8.23%. In when-issued trading, the two-year notes to be sold
Wednesday were quoted Friday at a price to yield 7.25%.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury's weekly bill auction that
normally takes place on Monday was held on Friday because of
the approaching holiday.
   The Treasury sold $20 billion of short-term bills Friday,
equally divided between three-month and six-month maturities.
Bond dealers complained that the auction was "sloppy" and
poorly bid.
   While the average discount rates on the new bills were the
lowest since mid-1988, the spreads were wide between the
average rates and the highest rates accepted.
   The average discount rate on the new three-month bills was
6.52% and the highest rate accepted was 6.55%. The average
discount rate on the six-month bills was set at 6.57% and the
highest rate accepted was 6.61%.
   Treasury bill auctions are usually tightly bid and rarely
have more than a 0.02 percentage-point "tail," or gap between
the average rate and the high rate.
   Here are details of Friday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
