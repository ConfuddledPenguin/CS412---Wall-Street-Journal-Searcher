   Some friends have tennis elbow
   Others suffer with jogger's knee,
   Which causes a left-out feeling
   For couch potatoes, like me.
   With gridiron season in swing,
   I'm less apt to feel inferior
   When complaining about my bad case
   Of TV-football posterior.

   Congress was thinking of putting on a Christmas pageant --
but it couldn't find three wise men.
