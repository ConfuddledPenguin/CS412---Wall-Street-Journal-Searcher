   The Alberta government approved construction of one of the
world's largest pulp mills, after two years of often stormy
debate in the Canadian province.
   The Japanese-backed, 1.3 billion Canadian dollar (US$1.12
billion) bleached kraft pulp mill became the main target for
critics of the Alberta government's recent push to develop
its northern forests.

   Environmental groups oppose the mill, which they maintain
will harm the Athabasca and Slave rivers. Lorraine Vetsch of
Edmonton (Alberta) Friends of the North said her group will
take court action to try to block construction of the mill.
   Bleached kraft pulp is used to produce a wide range of
paper products.
   The mill will be built by closely held Alberta-Pacific
Forest Industries Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, an affiliate of
British Columbia-based Crestbrook Forest Industries Ltd.
Crestbrook, a small pulp producer, is controlled by
Mitsubishi Corp. and Honshu Paper Co. of Japan.
   "We're really happy," an Alberta-Pacific spokeswoman said.
The company first announced the mill in 1988 and initially
planned to complete construction in 1991. Now it plans to
break ground next spring and complete the mill in late 1993.
   Situated near the town of Athabasca, north of Edmonton,
the mill will have an annual capacity of 496,000 metric tons.
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
Alberta-Pacific plans to build a C$300 million paper mill on
the same site later.
   Alberta-Pacific said its project will be the first
greenfield pulp mill that doesn't use chlorine, which is
traditionally used in the bleaching process. The company was
forced to redesign the mill to use other bleaching agents,
after an environmental review board found that the company's
first design could have damaged the Athabasca River.
   "The Alberta-Pacific project is the cleanest bleached
kraft pulp mill ever proposed in Canada," said Alberta
Forestry Minister LeRoy Fjordbotten. Analysts agreed, saying
that environmental safeguards also make this one of the most
expensive mills per ton of capacity ever built in Canada.
"This project has been studied from here to kingdom come," an
analyst said. "It has all the bells and whistles possible."
   About C$3.5 billion of pulp and paper projects either are
proposed or in various stages of completion in Alberta.
Daishowa Canada Co., a unit of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing
Co. of Japan, just completed a C$500 million bleached kraft
pulp mill near Peace River, Alberta.
   The provincial government backed many of the projects with
loans and other incentives. The government will ease the
sting for Alberta-Pacific of the long delay in approving the
mill by investing C$250 million in the project, C$100 million
more than initially promised. The government also will invest
as much as C$150 million in the company's proposed paper
mill. The government granted Alberta-Pacific timber rights to
a 28,000-square-mile area, a territory close in size to the
state of South Carolina.
