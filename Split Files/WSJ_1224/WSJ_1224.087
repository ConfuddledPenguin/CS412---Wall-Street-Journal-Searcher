   GREENWICH, Conn. -- Pittston Co. said it signed two
10-year agreements to supply low sulphur coal to subsidiaries
of American Electric Power Co. A total value for the accords
wasn't disclosed.
   The first agreement, with American Electric's Appalachian
Power Co., calls for Pittston to supply a minimum of one
million tons annually for 10 years starting in Oct. 1, 1991.
In the second pact, Pittston would supply the Ohio Power Co.
unit, starting with 240,000 tons in the first year and
gradually increasing to one million tons by the sixth year of
the contract.
