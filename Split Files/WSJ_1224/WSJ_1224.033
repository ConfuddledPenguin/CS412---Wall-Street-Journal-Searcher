   MOSCOW'S LEADERS SIGNALED a crackdown against breakaway
republics.
   KGB chief Kryuchkov, speaking to Soviet lawmakers, warned
Saturday that the West is stepping up espionage and economic
sabotage in the Soviet Union and that foreigners are
fostering Ukrainian secessionist moves. Gorbachev reinforced
the anti-independence drive by giving Moldavia 10 days to
take steps to defuse tensions. Legislators are to vote today
on a new government structure and broadened presidential
powers. A vote is expected later in the week on a union
treaty allowing more freedom for republics while retaining a
strong central government.
