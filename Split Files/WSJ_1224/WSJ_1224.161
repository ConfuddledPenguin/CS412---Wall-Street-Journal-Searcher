   NEW YORK -- Business expectations for sales, profits and
employment for the first quarter of 1991 are at their lowest
levels in eight years, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   In its latest quarterly survey of 1,500 business
executives nationwide, D&amp;B found that business optimism,
already rattled during the fourth quarter by the Middle East
situation, has fallen off even more for early 1991.

   Business expectations were down across the U.S, with the
retail sector reporting the sharpest drop in optimism. For
all firms, the sales optimism index fell 14 points to 36, the
lowest level since 1982. Retailers' expectations plummeted 30
points to 22, compared with 52 in the fourth quarter of 1990.
On a regional basis, the West North Central region reported
the sharpest decline in sales optimism, down 26 points to 36.
   Major industries across the U.S. expect first-quarter
profits to be down, the survey revealed. Dun &amp; Bradstreet's
profits optimism Index fell nine points to 34. By industry,
retailers are again the gloomiest, with their expectations
down 17 points to 23 from 40 in the fourth quarter of 1990.
By region, New England reported the sharpest decline in
profits optimism, down 21 points to 18.
   On the employment front, industries agree the prospects
aren't bright. The employment optimism index for the first
quarter of 1991 fell three points to eight, the lowest level
in eight years. Only the services sector's optimism remains
unchanged from the previous quarter's survey. On a regional
basis, first-quarter employment expectations were mixed, with
only the East South Central states reporting much hope.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a marketer of business information and
related services, has been conducting the Survey of Business
Expectations since 1947. The latest survey, conducted last
month, asked 1,500 executives in manufacturing, retailing and
wholesaling if they expected an increase, decrease or no
change in first-quarter sales, profits, prices, inventories,
employment, exports and new orders.
