   Northeast Bancorp, Stamford, Conn., hurt by further
deterioration in its loan portfolio in October and November,
said it expects to report a "sizable loss" for the fourth
quarter.
   It said the loss would "approximate" the loss of $25.8
million, or $3.27 a share, recorded in the year-earlier
quarter.

   Northeast Bancorp said the loss will result "principally"
from a boost in loan-loss reserves to cover increases in
nonperforming assets and charges against bad loans.
   "The increase in nonperforming assets since the third
quarter reflects the severity of the economic decline in
Connecticut, which is affecting all business sectors as well
as consumers," said Frank J. Kugler Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer.
   He said that based on year-end projections, "our capital
ratios will be well above regulatory minimums."
