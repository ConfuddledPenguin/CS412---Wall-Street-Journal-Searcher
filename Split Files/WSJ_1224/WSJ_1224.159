   TOKYO -- Japan's production of cars, buses and trucks
climbed 2.2% in November from a year earlier, but was much
lower than October's 12% year-to-year increase, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturer's Association reported.
   Japan's auto makers produced 1,160,036 vehicles in
November, down 12% from a record 1,263,321 units in October.

   A spokesman for the manufacturers' group said auto makers
likely had scaled back production following October's record
level because of slowing growth in consumer spending.
