   Peter R. Kann's brilliant feature about the fools and
vultures impeding the president's Gulf policies and options
("Stuck on the Miniature Gulf Course," editorial page, Dec.
3) summarizes the dastardly attempts to continue carving up
presidential and commander-in-chief powers.
   In World War II, the military options, including
developing the A-bomb, were not subject to daily debate and
approval by Congress, and even Vice President Truman
reportedly was unaware of the bomb's status. If my history is
right, we won that war confronting bullies and deploying a
weapon that prompted the Japanese to surrender
unconditionally -- and with fewer American casualties to
boot.

   Despite the feeble pun, the Gulf game isn't a golf game:
It's a prelude to another of the insane wars in which this
government is prone to involve us. Iraq is not another
Grenada, Panama or Libya. The Iraqis can, and will, fight
back. And the U.S. has helped equip them to do it.
   Mr. Kann suggested trading Congress for the U.N. Security
Council. It has already been accomplished. Considering the
bribes and concessions the U.S. has made to these countries,
why shouldn't they support the offensive action? Secretary of
State Baker has lowered further this government's already-low
esteem by asking Cuba, an outcast for 30 years, for support.
Mr. Bush went to Syria's Assad, asking help from possibly
this government's next candidate as "enemy of the month."
They have made concessions to the Chinese student-killers
only to gain their abstention in the Security Council vote.
   Unlike the U.N. council, members of Congress may at least
have read the U.S. Constitution. They also must face the
wrath of parents who may lose sons and daughters. Taxpayers,
already overburdened with government waste, are not ready for
more obligations.
