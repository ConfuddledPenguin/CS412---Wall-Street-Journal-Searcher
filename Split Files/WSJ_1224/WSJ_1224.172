   MOSCOW -- The Soviet leadership continued its offensive
against maverick republics, cracking down at home even as it
assured the West that foreign policy won't be changing with
the resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, addressing the Congress
of People's Deputies, the nation's highest legislative body,
pointed a finger at the West as he spoke of the dangers
facing the nation. In his speech, later broadcast in full on
television, Mr. Kryuchkov warned that "outside forces" are
trying to use the Soviet Union's difficulties to gain the
upper hand. He accused the West of stepping up espionage and
economic sabotage, sending contaminated foods and inspiring a
brain-drain of emigration.

   Mr. Kryuchkov accused foreign organizations of fostering
Ukrainian efforts at secession and noted with concern that
Western secret services are stepping up their efforts to
collect information on the Soviet Union, including its
"defenses, the scientific and technical potential, the size
of strategic stocks of raw materials, fuel, food and currency
reserves."
   Outside forces "are trying to exert overt and covert
pressure on the Soviet Union and to impose doubtful ideas and
plans to pull the country out of the difficult situation," he
said. "All these efforts often screen a desire to strengthen
not so much us as their own positions in our country."
   Such attacks hark back to decades of pre-Gorbachev
official paranoia, and indeed to centuries of cultural
xenophobia. As troubling as such attacks may be to Western
ears, the main aim of Mr. Kryuchkov's speech was to stifle
republics that are striving for independence. President
Mikhail Gorbachev himself reinforced this with a decree on
Moldavian independence that also held grave portents for
other secession-minded republics, especially the three Baltic
republics.
   Mr. Gorbachev's decree answered Moldavian officials'
demands to stop two minority regions within the republic from
claiming their own sovereignty. The decree annulled such
internal sovereignty declarations, but also included harsh
threats directed at the Moldavian government itself. Mr.
Gorbachev gave the republic 10 days to take various moves to
defuse its internal tension, including repealing its law
promoting the Romanian language. "In the event of this decree
not being respected, necessary steps will be taken in
accordance with the authority granted to the U.S.S.R.
president by the constitution," the decree said.
   The decree had worrisome implications for the independence
drives in other republics as well. In particular, it declared
invalid Moldavia's denunciation of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact,
which led to the incorporation of much of Moldavia and the
Baltic republics into the Soviet Union. The Baltics are
claiming independence on the same historical grounds.
   Baltic officials meanwhile have been complaining that the
Soviet Union is stepping up pressure within the republics. In
Lithuania, armed Soviet soldiers are patrolling the port of
Klaipeda and are authorized to search and arrest local
citizens. The Soviet government has said it is willing to
reopen negotiations with Lithuania, but Lithuanian officials
are skeptical. Lithuanian president Vytautas Landsbergis told
pro-independence politicians, "Attempts are being made to
impose a union treaty upon Lithuania through threats of
bloodshed and use of violence," He called for preparations
for "resistance and self-defense."
   Nonetheless, most deputies at the Congress in Moscow don't
see a way of resolving the nation's problems without a strong
central power. Although many have started expressing concern
about dictatorship since Mr. Shevardnadze voiced the word,
most are still prepared to vote in favor of Mr. Gorbachev's
plan to strengthen presidential powers.
   The vote by the Congress on constitutional changes to
establish a new government structure and strengthen the
presidency is scheduled for today and will be followed later
in the week by a vote on the new union treaty. The treaty
would create a new national structure with more independence
for republics while retaining a strong central government.
   A resolution supporting the idea of a new union treaty may
well pass the Congress, although many republics refuse to
sign on to the current draft. Even if republics refuse to
accept the union treaty, however, once they grant the
president his new powers, battles over the treaty will be
more unequal than ever.
   "Actually, all the main ideas of the treaty are offered as
amendments to the constitution, and there's no doubt they'll
be passed by the Congress," says political scientist Andranik
Migranyan, in the first issue of a liberal daily, The
Independent Newspaper. "It's absolutely clear that all these
measures of the center are aimed against the recalcitrant
republics."
   "Gorbachev's fate may be tragic," Yuri Afanasyev, a
prominent leader of the liberal group of Parliament members,
the Interregional Group of Deputies, writes in the same
paper. "The initiator of perestroika may become its
undertaker."
   Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation seems to have roused
dispirited democrats to try to organize to fight for checks
and balances on the new presidential powers, but few see them
accomplishing much beyond a new flurry of public rallies.
Increasingly, even democratic newspapers are starting to
point out the lack of organization and factionalism that has
sapped their potential power.
   "Many deputies already don't consider it a detriment to
their reputation to doubt the value of democracy as a whole,"
wrote the nation's largest daily, Komsomolskaya Pravda. "And
our president uses the thesis of democratic choice more and
more rarely."
