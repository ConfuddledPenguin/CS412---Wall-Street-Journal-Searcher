   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. has changed the
timing of its stock awards and incentive compensation
pay-outs in a way that will produce tax breaks for its
highest-ranking executives at the expense of most other
senior managers.
   The auto maker distributed the payments this month,
instead of in January as originally planned, because "tax
rates are higher next year," said Robert A. Lutz, president
of Chrysler Motors.

   But the federal income tax rates are primarily increasing
in 1991 for the wealthiest Chrysler executives -- the same
ones who decided to change the timing of the payments. The
far greater number of managers who are eligible for the
payments earn less money, and receiving the payments this
month instead of in January creates significant tax
disadvantages for them.
   The income-tax rate for many of these managers will be
reduced next year, under the new federal tax law. Also, these
managers will have to pay taxes on the compensation a year
earlier than they previously had planned.
   The move has angered many managers at Chrysler who weren't
aware the change was coming, and who have been asked by top
management to make deep sacrifices over the past 1 1/2 years.
"Something like this makes it seem like we have to carry more
of the burden here than those at the top," complained one
Chrysler manager, who asked not to be named. "At the very
least it sends the wrong message."
   "It's going to hurt some people to put a lump sum out
there" this year instead of next, conceded Chrysler spokesman
Thomas Houston. "We did what was deemed to be the best for
everyone at the time."
   Chrysler declined to disclose how much any of its
executives will receive from the stock and cash payments.
Amounts given to officers such as Chairman Lee A. Iacocca,
Vice Chairman R.S. Miller Jr. and Mr. Lutz won't be disclosed
until the company sends out its proxy statement this spring.
   The money involved is substantial in some cases. Under the
unusual "bet-your check" program that Chrysler set up in July
1989, managers could wager as much as 10% of their annual
salary against the company's ability to meet a $1 billion
cost-cutting goal by the end of this year. By exceeding that
target the 2,000 senior managers and executives who
participated doubled their money.
   The one-time stock awards have a different purpose.
Chrysler established them last summer to compensate 1,800
top-level employees who weren't getting their usual cash
bonuses, which can equal half of their total compensation.
Chrysler couldn't give out the regular bonuses because of a
union contract that prevents such pay-outs when hourly
workers don't get profit-sharing checks. Omitting the bonus
had been the major reason turnover tripled, as compared with
the normal level, earlier this year.
   Under the new federal tax law, taxpayers earning more than
$180,000 a year will see their tax rate increase to 31% in
1991 from 28% this year. But because of a quirk in the tax
structure, those who earn $80,000 to $180,000 will actually
see their tax rates drop to 31% from 33% this year.
   Financial planners are encouraging their wealthiest
clients to push as much income as they can into this year. A
study by Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. showed a wealthy taxpayer
expecting a $55,000 bonus could save nearly 3% in taxes, or
at least $1,470, by taking the bonus this year instead of in
1991. That is even after considering profits that could have
been reaped from investing the taxes instead of paying them
to the Internal Revenue Service a year early. In any event,
Chrysler's top executives are expected to get payments far
larger than the Arthur Andersen example.
   Advisers are saying the exact opposite to those who get
hit by the higher tax rate this year, but whose rates will
drop next year. "If people are going to have to pay the 33%
rate this year, they shouldn't pull any extra income into
this year if they can avoid it," said Nick Bubnovich, a
consultant with Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   Chrysler's lower-ranking executives didn't have much of a
choice, however. IRS rules discourage companies from giving
employees the option of taking compensation in one year or
the next.
