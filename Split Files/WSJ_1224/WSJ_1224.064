   MOSCOW -- General Motors Corp. will open permanent offices
in Moscow and the Russian auto manufacturing city of
Togliatti, the Tass news agency reported.
   In June, General Motors signed a five-year, $1 billion
deal with the Volga Auto Works to supply 100,000 to 150,000
engine control systems a year. The agreement with the auto
works, located in Togliatti, is by far the largest deal ever
signed by a U.S. auto maker with the Soviet Union.
