   WASHINGTON -- A congressional committee said it found no
evidence to support claims that the Central Intelligence
Agency was involved with savings-and-loan failures.
   The House Intelligence Committee said Friday that it was
closing a nine-month preliminary inquiry into allegations
that the CIA had fraudulently used S&amp;L funds, among other
claims. Those charges, the committee concluded, were "based
primarily on second-hand information."

   The conclusions were disclosed in a letter to Rep. Frank
Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of a House banking
subcommittee. He sought the investigation after a series of
articles in the Houston Post that alleged the CIA or
organized crime was involved in the failures of 26 thrifts.
   The Intelligence Committee said it investigated three
specific charges: that CIA operatives used connections with
S&amp;Ls to fraudulently obtain loans, that the agency used S&amp;L
funds to support covert operations and that the CIA
intervened with federal prosecutors to deter them from
pursuing particular cases.
   The committee said it interviewed several individuals who
claimed to know others who had information about CIA
involvement in S&amp;L failures. But either those parties
"refused to identify the source, or the source refused to be
interviewed," said the letter, signed by chairman Anthony
Beilenson (D., Calif.).
   Federal prosecutors denied that the CIA had attempted to
quash any S&amp;L prosecutions. "The federal prosecutors and law
enforcement personnel interviewed were quite clear on that
point," Mr. Beilenson said.
   The congressional investigators said the CIA did use
routine financial services at four of the S&amp;Ls named by the
Houston Post. "Those were consistent with routine agency
practices," Mr. Beilenson said.
