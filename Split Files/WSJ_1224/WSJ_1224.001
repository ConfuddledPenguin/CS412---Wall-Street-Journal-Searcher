   It's a Bit Hard to Tote That Barge

   ST. LOUIS -- Does Old Man River really just go rollin'
along here, or has he been shoved aside by a pushy
interloper?
   The answer depends on whether a river is its water or its
name.

   Here's the problem: St. Louis is on the Mississippi River;
textbooks, road maps and Mark Twain all say so. But can you,
from here, dangle your feet (if you are hardy enough to want
to at this time of year) in the muddy Mississippi? There are
some who say no, because the water that flows past St. Louis
is traveling under an assumed name.
   Water specialists and river engineers agree that the water
alongside the city limits isn't water from the Mississippi
after all; it's from the Missouri River.
   The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers maintain that although the Mississippi and Missouri
rivers merge about 16 miles north of St. Louis, the waters
probably don't completely mix until at least 30 to 40 miles
south of the city. The wide stream of the silt-laden Missouri
River forces the Mississippi water toward the Illinois shore
and East St. Louis, with the two separate currents traveling
along side by side.
   Adding insult to injury, "there are people who say that
the entire river {from the confluence on south} should be
called the Missouri, because it constitutes the majority of
the flow," says David A. Visintainer, an engineer executive
for the city's water division.
   But that's a "ridiculous" contention, asserts Lloyd Waite,
a hydrologist for the Geological Survey's district office
here. "They can say the currents haven't mixed totally, but
it's still the Mississippi River."
   Claude Strauser, chief of the U.S. Army's potamology
(study of rivers) section, calls the occurrence "one of those
mind-grabbers that's very interesting and fun" and will
continue to generate lighthearted debate for years.
   A spokeswoman for the Geological Survey says the situation
isn't unique and exists in many other streams where one is
the tributary to another. Still, this is the mighty
Mississippi that's in question. Would the familiar song be as
popular if the lyrics were "Down the Missouri to New
Orleans?"
   As far as this city's tourism promoters are concerned,
though, Old Man River can answer to any name he likes. A name
change "wouldn't make any difference," declares a tourist
board spokeswoman.
