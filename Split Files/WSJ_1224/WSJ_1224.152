   Gold, once the hedge for all seasons, seems to have lost
its magic.
   Traditionally, traders have switched to gold for stability
during international crises, which are often marked by
falling currency values, high oil prices and unstable stock
markets. And in economic downturns, which spread fears of
financial collapse and often come with rising inflation and
low real interest rates, gold has been a haven.

   Until now, that is.
   Despite a brief run-up last Wednesday in the wake of the
Federal Reserve's reduction in the discount rate, the
February gold contract ended the week at about $384.30 an
ounce -- almost unchanged from where it was at the beginning
of August, before Iraq invaded Kuwait and before the U.S.
economy soured. In fact, ever since the early 1980s gold
prices have failed to move with inflation, currencies and oil
prices the way they had earlier. The current gold price,
adjusted for inflation, is actually slightly lower than the
average price in 1975, when U.S. gold trading began.
   "I'm not so sure the historical patterns are going to
hold," says William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with
Merrill Lynch. "We may have a whole new ball game for gold."
   That's what Earl Hadady, publisher of the Bullish
Consensus newsletter, is guessing. According to his
newsletter's survey of hundreds of traders and analysts, the
sentiment about gold is now slightly bearish (48% on a
bearish-to-bullish scale of 1% to 100%).
   "We think it will go considerably lower, even though the
prices look like bargain basement," says Mr. Hadady. He is
recommending that clients sell their gold.
   Investors clearly don't see gold as the best protection
against catastrophes anymore. "At one time, gold was the
generic hedge for everything," says Mr. O'Neill. But now,
with the active use of options and futures, investors can
protect themselves more directly.
   For example, instead of fleeing to gold, they can hedge
petroleum or currency risks by switching markets or
instruments for the same commodity.
   Gold, Mr. O'Neill says, has become a "third-rate hedge."
Even when investors do look for outside alternatives, they're
more likely to end up in cash or Treasury bills.
   In fairness to the metal, the current situation has
important differences from the past. This downturn hasn't
seen the high inflation common in past skids, so real
interest rates have remained high enough that investors
haven't been scared into non-interest-bearing commodities
such as gold. And the Persian Gulf crisis hasn't had the
impact on markets that a major or world-wide conflict would.
   Still, some wonder whether gold's traditional status as a
haven in crises has been a myth all along. Jeffrey Nichols,
who heads American Precious Metals Advisors, points out that
gold didn't react favorably to the Falkland Islands, Grenada
or Libya conflicts of the 1980s. Gold did well in the 1973-74
recession, but Mr. Nichols says there had been a bull market
for gold before that. Gold prices cleared $850 an ounce
during the Iran conflict in 1979-80, but that was also a time
of double-digit inflation.
   The fundamentals, at least, suggest a prettier picture for
gold than market psychology has allowed. Gold demand is at a
"historically high level" despite softer jewelry orders, Mr.
Nichols says. Gold supply is likely to become tighter.
Gold-mine production had been rising rapidly but appears to
have peaked. Production is declining in South Africa and
should fall in Australia next year as labor costs rise; North
American production should peak in the next year or two.
   In addition, some gold companies have borrowed gold from
central bank vaults to raise cash to finance mine
development, creating an artificial bulge in gold supply. But
companies will soon begin paying back those loans with the
gold they produce, reducing the available supply.
   Still, the supply-demand equation has dubious value for
gold traders, as many of those who buy gold hoard it
regardless of price. (People won't start selling the rings
off their fingers even if gold prices do rally.) PaineWebber
analyst Peter Marcus says that with gold, so-called supply
and demand fundamentals are "irrelevant chatter." He also
notes that gold companies' stocks haven't been a useful hedge
this time, either.
   And gold traders, who have killed every gold rally with
heavy selling in the past few years, aren't about to let gold
go much over $400, analysts say.
   Merrill Lynch's Mr. O'Neill says: "We'll need a major
banking crisis or a massive world war to jolt gold out of the
doldrums."
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Petroleum futures prices, except for heating oil, took a
wallop late Friday as traders anticipated the four-day
weekend suspension in trading activity caused by the
Christmas holiday. Crude oil fell 47 cents a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, and gasoline was lower as well.
Heating oil, however, continued to show strength, primarily
on the progress of a winter storm. Some traders predicted
weakness in heating oil when trading resumes Wednesday if the
harsh weather fails to hit the Northeast, the nation's
biggest heating oil market.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Prices will continue to fluctuate on speculation about
when Moscow might use its $1 billion in U.S. credit
guarantees to buy U.S. foodstuffs.
   Despite the prospect of exports to the Soviet Union, U.S.
grain prices have slipped since the Bush administration
granted the credit guarantees this month. Traders were
disappointed because they had expected the White House to
extend as much as a $3 billion package.
   What's more, the two nations seem divided over how the
credit guarantees should be used. Washington reportedly
opposes Moscow's desire to use some U.S.backed credits to pay
for shipping the U.S. foodstuffs to Soviet ports. Traders
also aren't clear on what U.S. commodities the Soviets might
be interested in buying.
   Moscow wanted the guarantees because U.S. exporters and
financial institutions had grown wary of extending it credit.
Amid economic turmoil, the Soviet Union has fallen behind on
its import-related debts this year.
                                                                                                       

   Silver
                                                                                                       

   Traders' hopes that silver would finally stage a
significant rally and retain its gains were dashed last week
after what seemed a promising start.
   Last week's cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate and
the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze seemed to give new life to silver. The metal had
attracted some demand when the price fell to $3.93 an ounce,
the lowest in almost 15 years, a little over a week ago. The
news from the Fed and the Kremlin sent the price up more than
13 cents.
   But the rally proved illusory. The buying was mostly
technical, from traders who had previously sold silver short,
and once it was exhausted, there was no follow-through.
   In fact, on Friday the market fell into a hole. From an
intraday high of $4.40 on Thursday, the most active March
contract dropped to a low Friday of $4.03, a skid of 8.4%
from one session to the next.
   Silver has been chronically beset by a lack of investor
interest, and the slowing U.S. economy is eroding industrial
demand. Analysts say the metal's decline to new lows may
resume.
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices fluctuated wildly Friday on concern that
freezing weather might hit Florida citrus-growing areas. The
price of the January contract ended with a loss of 3.6 cents
a pound at $1.1640.
   But fears of a Florida chill were dismissed by Peter
Leavitt, vice president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford,
Mass. Temperatures in Florida are expected to remain mild
through Christmas, he said.
   In California, however, temperatures on Thursday night
dropped into the mid to upper 20s in the central and southern
San Joaquin Valley's citrus-growing areas, Mr. Leavitt said.
Scattered cold patches were expected to extend farther south,
where some citrus fruits are grown but not in commercial
quantities, he said.
