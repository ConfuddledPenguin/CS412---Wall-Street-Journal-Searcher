   CMS Energy Corp. said it has boosted the line of credit
held by its unregulated energy businesses to meet their
higher capital needs next year and to post a bond in a legal
proceeding over $1.5 billion of frozen assets.
   The Dearborn, Mich., electric and gas utility said Friday
that it has arranged for a $500 million line of credit with a
bank group led by Union Bank and the Citibank unit of
Citicorp. The new loan will be used to consolidate credit
arrangements with several different banks that had extended
it a total of $280 million in credit.

   CMS Energy officials said they will spend $125 million of
the credit to post a surety bond in their ongoing court case
over $1.2 billion in notes and $341 million in equity the
company received for its contribution to the Midland
Cogeneration Venture. CMS officials said they plan to use the
remainder of the funds in their unregulated energy
businesses.
