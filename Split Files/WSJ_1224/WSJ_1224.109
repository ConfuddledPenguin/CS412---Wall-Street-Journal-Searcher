   Television audiences may get talked to death this season.
   Seven new daily talk shows are poised to go on the air,
joining a field already crowded with gabfest hosts known by
their first names: Oprah, Geraldo, Arsenio, Sally, Joan,
Regis and Kathie Lee. Not to mention Phil Donahue, the
granddaddy of all the talkers.

   TV producers, stung by the failure of four game shows and
three "reality-based" programs introduced in syndication this
year, say they expect to fare better with talk shows. The
programs "have had the greatest degree of success as a
program type in the past several years," says Mitchell
Praver, a vice president at Katz Continental Television, a
station consultant. "The worst performing talk show does
better than the best performing of the new game shows."
   Those vying for spots include an entertainment-oriented
show starring Chuck Woolery, the snickering host of the
popular "Love Connection" video dating show; a hot-topic
program starring Maury Povich, the eyebrow-arching former
anchor of the tabloid ratings giant "A Current Affair"; and a
female-oriented show starring Jenny Jones, a comedian who
performs a nightclub stand-up routine for women.
   There's also a single-topic program starring Sarah
Purcell, who starred on "Real People." And former President
Reagan's son Ron is weighing in with a late-night talk show.
   Despite the talk shows' cost of between $150,000 and
$300,000 a week, producers say they're worth it. "Unlike
{less-expensive} game shows or flash-in-the-pan concepts,
these shows tend to become franchises that last a decade,"
says Scott Carlin, senior vice president of Warner Bros.
Domestic Television, a unit of Time Warner Inc., which is
distributing "Jenny Jones."
   But not all of the new entries will even get on the air,
let alone last long enough to build a franchise. "We've
already reached the saturation point," says Richard A.
Kurlander, vice president and director of programming at
Petry Television, a station consulting firm.
   For example, "Realities," a new show from Viacom Inc., is
already having problems despite the presence of David
Hartman, the popular former co-anchor of the ABC network's
"Good Morning America." The pilot, five pre-taped pieces not
unlike prime-time magazine shows such as "60 Minutes" and
"20/20," was poorly received by stations, so Viacom is
retooling the show.
   The shakeout in talk shows likely will occur before the
National Association of Television Program Executives' annual
convention scheduled to begin Jan. 14 in New Orleans. The
convention is a glitzy high-technology flea market where
producers of talk, game and reality-based shows entering
syndication peddle their goods to individual stations.
   For example, if "Realities" isn't sold to at least 20
stations before NATPE, it would be "difficult" to continue
with the project, concedes Michael Gerber, president of
first-run syndication at Viacom.
   Still, independent stations and network affiliates are
eager to use talk shows to fill programming gaps. Late last
week, for example, the NBC network said it was giving back
one hour of the daytime schedule to its 209 affiliates. The
sudden move by NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, means most
stations will seek to fill the 60 minutes with syndicated
programming.
   Jerry Dalrymple, general manager of KWTV, the CBS
affiliate in Oklahoma City, says the new glut of talk shows
isn't unexpected. "What are syndicators going to do?" he
asks. "People last year tried new high-tech game shows and
other things to beat {ratings giants} `Wheel of Fortune,'
`Jeopardy]' and Oprah, but nothing happened," he says.
   Indeed, the rookie game shows "Trump Card," "The
Challengers," "Quiz Kids Challenge" and "Tic Tac Dough" all
bombed. Reality-based shows fared no better: "Preview: First
Look at the New" was recently axed, and neither Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s "Personalities" nor King World Productions
Inc.'s "Total Recall" has ignited the ratings. Next
September, only two new games shows are entering the field:
"Scrabble," based on the popular board game and a retread of
"The $100,000 Pyramid."
   There's a lot at stake for the stations. Syndicated shows
cost far less to buy than, say, reruns of network situation
comedies, which can run $500,000 a week. The producer
receives a fee from each station and keeps half of the
advertising time -- seven minutes in a one-hour talk show --
to sell to national sponsors. The local stations keep the
other seven minutes.
   Syndicators say finding a "television star" before
constructing a show is of the utmost importance. That's what
happened with Mr. Woolery, says Robert King, president of
Orion Television Entertainment, a unit of Orion Pictures
Corp. "We wanted to find a daytime television star to host a
show," says Mr. King. The original host of the daytime
version of "Wheel of Fortune," Mr. Woolery spent the past
eight years hosting "Love Connection," where he dares to be
goofy and has developed a disarming way of debriefing couples
after their first date.
   So far, Mr. Woolery's show has been sold in 44 markets.
And Ms. Jones' program has been sold to about 50 stations.
But Mr. Povich's program from Paramount Television, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc., has sold faster than any other
talk show in recent history. It's been purchased by at least
71 stations, including 28 of the top 30 markets.
   "We're doing it because we have Povich," says Lucy
Salhany, president of Paramount's domestic TV unit. "We
wouldn't do a talk show simply to do a talk show." Paramount
already has established syndicated shows, "Entertainment
Tonight" and "Hard Copy," in the lucrative one hour that
proceeds prime time; the "Arsenio Hall Show" in the
late-night slot; and a weekly syndicated hit, "Star Trek: The
Next Generation."
   If Maury, Chuck, Jenny or Ron fail, there are already
others prepared to shoot off their mouths: Talks are
continuing between Tribune Entertainment, a unit of Tribune
Co., and comedian Gary Shandling, among others, about a
late-night talk show. And King World Productions recently
completed test marketing a morning talk show on the NBC
affiliate in Baltimore with the husband-wife team of Tim and
Daphne Reid.
   Says Mr. Kurlander, the consultant: "There's so much
controversy and so many celebrities to go around. Instead of
talk being cheap, the glut is cheapening talk."
