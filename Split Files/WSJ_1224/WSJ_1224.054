   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp., bowing to pressure from
California's smog regulators, said it will make $515 million
in additions to its Wilmington, Calif., refinery, allowing it
to produce less polluting "reformulated" gasolines.
   Unocal had steadfastly refused to join the pack of other
oil companies -- including Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron
Corp. and Shell Oil Co. -- who rushed to the market with
reformulated gasolines over the past year in anticipation of
tougher new air pollution standards.

   Company executives had argued that Unocal already
introduced a reformulated gasoline when it converted its
stations to all-unleaded pumps a few years back and that they
didn't want to introduce a gasoline that would be only
slightly cleaner. The company instead launched a $10 million
public relations campaign, buying up smog-belching old cars
in the Los Angeles area and scrapping them, offering free
emission checks for aging autos and having a small fleet of
Unocal trucks cruise the freeways to help stranded motorists.
   But the need to blend cleaner gasolines became an
inevitability in September when the California Air Resources
Board adopted the strictest smog laws in the nation,
requiring oil companies to provide alternative fuels
beginning in 1994 and calling for mass production of
low-polluting cars, including electric cars. Next September,
the board will consider regulations to make the fuel
restrictions even tougher.
   "I'm sure this was a factor in what Unocal is doing now,"
a spokesman for the Air Resources Board said. "They were
intimately involved in the development of our new rules."
   The new facilities, set to be completed in late 1993, will
include a 55,000 barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker feed
hydrotreater, a hydrogen plant and related sulfur recovery
units and will result in substantially reduced sulfur oxide
emissions from the cracker unit, Unocal said. Refinery
production will rise by about 8,000 barrels a day from the
current 80,000.
