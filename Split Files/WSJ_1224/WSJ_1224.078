   DENVER -- MiniScribe Corp., the defunct disk-drive maker,
sued its former officers and directors, accusing them of
manipulating the company's financial statements, among other
wrongdoing.
   Any damages collected as a result of the suit will become
part of MiniScribe's estate in bankruptcy court and will be
used to pay creditors, said Denver attorney Greg Ruegsegger,
who filed the suit in state court in Boulder.

   MiniScribe filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code almost a year ago, and
most of its assets were sold in April to Maxtor Corp., a
California-based maker of data-storage products.
   MiniScribe staged a comeback in the last half of the 1980s
under the chairmanship of Q.T. Wiles, onetime chairman of the
venture capital firm of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. After Mr. Wiles's
resignation in February 1989, company investigators found
that much of the company's recovery was the product of
creative bookkeeping.
   Mr. Wiles is among the defendants in the company's suit
and in suits previously filed by shareholders and creditors.
Mr. Wiles's Denver attorney, Ken Starr, said his client is
"denying any wrongdoing" in his stewardship of the company.
