   Healthy Aging Hinges
   On Income, Education

   MONEY and schooling are the keys to healthy aging, a major
study concludes.
   Drawing on two large national surveys -- one involving
45,000 adults and the other 3,600 -- James S. House and five
colleagues from the University of Michigan's Institute for
Social Research analyzed how education, income, race, sex and
marital status correlate with health as people age. They
measured health both by the amount of such chronic conditions
as cancer, heart attacks and strokes and by the extent to
which respondents are limited in such daily activities as
walking and lifting.
   On average, whites were found healthier than blacks at
every age, men healthier than women and married people
healthier than the unmarried. But these differences were far
less striking than differences based on income and education.
   The researchers divided respondents into four
socioeconomic groups: high education and income, low
education and income, and two middle groupings. In early
adulthood, ages 25 to 34, health differences among the groups
are minimal.
   From then on, however, socioeconomic factors play an
increasing role, and the health of the four groups steadily
diverges. The health of the low socioeconomic group
deteriorates rapidly, that of the highest group declines
comparatively slowly and the two middle groups show an
intermediate pattern.
   Prevalence of chronic conditions, for example, peaks
between 55 and 64 for the lowest group, between 65 and 74 for
the lower middle group, and not until after 75 for the two
higher groups. A similar trend shows for loss of functional
capacity.
   Efforts to postpone chronic illnesses and disabilities
until very late in life, the researchers declare, must
involve measures to reduce socioeconomic differences earlier
in life.
                                                                                                       

   For Women, Remarriage
   Can Be Fruitful
                                                                                                       

   HALF THE WOMEN who remarry while still in their
childbearing years give birth in the second marriage.
   Howard Wineberg, a Portland State University demographer
in Oregon, examined the reproductive history of almost 4,000
women who married for the second time between 1960 and 1984
at an age of 35 or younger. By June 1985, 47.9% of the
remarried women had already given birth, and another 6.4%
expected to. Racial differences were slight.
   Most of the births occurred within 24 months of
remarriage. Not surprisingly, the younger a woman was at the
time of remarriage, the more likely she was to have a child
in the second marriage. And childbearing depended to a large
degree on the number of children the woman had before
remarriage. Women with two or more kids already were
"significantly less likely" to give birth in the second
marriage.
   Poorly educated white women, Mr. Wineberg says, were
considerably more likely to give birth in the second marriage
than high-school or college graduates. But among black women,
college graduates were more apt to have children in a second
marriage.
                                                                                                       

   Mental-Health Problems
   Prevalent in Children
                                                                                                       

   PSYCHOLOGICAL disorders affect almost 10.7 million
children, one out of every five under 18 years old.
   A 1988 government child health survey questioned parents
of more than 17,000 children about learning disabilities,
developmental delays and emotional or behavioral problems.
About seven million children -- more than 13% of all those
between three and 18 -- were reported to have had emotional
or behavioral problems lasting three months or longer or
requiring psychological treatment. These problems included
phobias and anxiety disorders, childhood depression and
aggressive or antisocial conduct.
   An estimated 3.4 million children, or 6.5% of those aged
three to 18, were said to have exceptional difficulty
learning to read and write or do arithmetic. About 2.5
million children, 4% of those between birth and 18, had some
delay in growth or development, ranging from Down's syndrome
to temporary problems due to early illness or injury. The
total number affected by some disorder is estimated at 10.7
million, with some children having problems in more than one
category.
   Analysts Nicholas Zill of Child Trends Inc., a nonprofit
research organization in Washington, D.C., and Charlotte
Schoenborn of the National Center for Health Statistics say
the results establish psychological disorders as being "among
the most prevalent chronic conditions of childhood and
adolescence." They note, for comparison, that 3.5 million
children have chronic bronchitis, 3.2 million have asthma and
1.1 million have heart murmurs.
   Possible causes for the "alarmingly high" level of
psychological disorders, they suggest, include growing
numbers of children who experience parental divorce, are born
outside marriage or are raised in low-income, single-parent
households; increased survival rates of very low birthweight
babies; and effects of environmental contamination.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FATHERS are more likely to pay attention to daughters if
there are also sons in the family than if there are girls
only, say University of Pennsylvania researchers S. Philip
Morgan and Kathleen Harris. . . . Children from divorced
families tend to get sick more often than those in intact
families, University of California demographer Jane Mauldon
finds. She attributes this more to custodial parents' lowered
income than to children's emotional distress. . . .
Correctional jobs were the fastest-growing type of municipal
employment in 1989, the Census Bureau says.
