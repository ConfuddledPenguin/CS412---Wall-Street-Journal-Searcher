   NEW YORK -- The economy is ending this year and beginning
the new year on a decidedly downward note.
   Even before all the data for December are collected and
tallied, economists are bracing for a sharp drop in
fourth-quarter economic activity. That is because a spate of
negative numbers in October and November has convincingly
demonstrated the economy's weaknesses.

   Moreover, though generally pleased with the Federal
Reserve's moves to lower key interest rates last week,
economists warn that the beneficial effects of lower rates
won't show up in the economic statistics for months.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in
New York likens the economic situation to a balloon that has
been deflated. "The air is still being let out." It will be
midyear, at least, "before the lower rates kick in," he says.
   Others argue that the benefits of the initial easing of
monetary policy will be muted during this recession. The
reason: Banks and other lending institutions, with plenty of
their own headaches, are choosing their customers more
carefully. Alan Levenson, a director of financial services
for the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting and consulting
firm, puts it in a more cynical context. "The banking sector
is like a roach motel. The reserves come in but the money
won't go out."
   Economists don't expect this week's indicators to add
much, if any, brightness to the already dreary economic
picture. Wrapping up the November data are durable goods
orders, scheduled for release Thursday, followed by the
leading indicators index on Friday.
   The WEFA Group's Mr. Levenson says durable goods orders
are so volatile he doesn't even bother to try to predict
them.
   Indeed there tends to be a wide range of predictions
floating around. Gary Ciminero, an economist at Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group in Rhode Island, sees durable goods orders
dropping as much as 6.2%. In contrast, the consensus, as
surveyed by MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.,
New York, sees durable goods orders falling about 3%. In
October, durable goods rose a surprising 3.6%, mostly on the
strength of aircraft orders.
   There is less disagreement over what the leading
indicators index is likely to do. The consensus view holds
the index will decline by 0.5%. If so, that would mark the
fifth consecutive monthly decline. In October, the index fell
1.2% to 141.6.
   A report released last Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia suggests that the economic weakness is
spilling over into December. The survey revealed that 54% of
the companies polled said business was slowing in December
from November, while only 15% said it was improving.
Moreover, 40% of the concerns surveyed said they are cutting
back on working hours and trimming payrolls, moves that will
show up as negatives in future data.
   In another measure of the economic outlook, a survey of
U.S. corporate controllers shows that many believe the
recession will be short-lived. According to the survey by the
National Association of Accountants, 87% of U.S. corporate
controllers predict a recession in 1991, but only 17% say it
will continue into 1992. Asked what factors would have the
greatest impact on the economy over the next six months, the
controllers rated the Iraq crisis first, followed by interest
rates and the budget deficit.
