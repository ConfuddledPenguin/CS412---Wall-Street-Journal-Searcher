   BUENOS AIRES -- In most countries, recession means
belt-tightening. But Argentina likes to do things
differently. Here, says Susana Germinaro, while waiting on
customers in the exclusive leather-goods shop she manages,
"People are buying belts."
   They're also buying clothes. And shoes. And plane tickets
abroad. "And appliances," says shop-owner Daniel Polensvaig.
"Everybody's buying appliances like nuts. TV sets. VCRs.
Freezers. In the last six months, spending has been crazy."

   It's long been said that Argentina's steady economic slide
led many Argentines to seek solace on the shrink's couch.
Now, they're also seeking respite by spending money.
   Even as Argentina goes through what is described as its
worst recession ever, the country is experiencing a consumer
boom -- although many caution that the boom is limited to the
ever-smaller number of Argentines who can afford to consume.
The newsweekly Noticias recently reported that sales of
clothes are up 46.4%, washing-machine sales have climbed 51%,
and travel agents are selling 89% more airline tickets.
   Lured by the current cheap dollar, Argentines are
traveling -- and buying -- abroad in droves. Punta del Este,
the fashionable resort in neighboring Uruguay, is expecting
one million Argentines during the Southern hemisphere summer.
   But it's not just abroad that Argentines are consuming.
Even as they continue to complain about "la crisis," large,
upscale shopping malls are opening all over Argentina. And
their business is booming. "From what salespeople say,
they're selling twice what they sold elsewhere," says Alicia
Moszkowski, sales director of Alto Palermo, the newest
shopping mall.
   Some say the spending spree is a sign of optimism that
President Carlos Menem's free-market policies are finally
beginning to arrest the country's decline. "They're spending
because they feel confident, and they're spending at high
prices in dollar terms," says Brian McMahon, an economist.
   Others say it's a sign of pessimism. "People don't save
money here because money is worthless," says Mr. Polensvaig,
who owns a store in Alto Palermo. "People still don't trust
their currency, so what do you do? You buy dollars, or you
buy goods."
   Some say it's because the Argentine austral is currently
overvalued in relation to the dollar, leaving more disposable
income once spending on food, which is pegged to the dollar,
is excluded. Or, they say, it's because inflation has fallen
to below two digits. Others, however, point out that when the
dollar was high and Argentina was in hyperinflation a few
months ago, people were buying, too, because anything was
better than holding on to their money.
   "It's a case for psychologists," says Irma Scarpin, a
saleswoman at Pigalle, a shoe and leather-goods shop in the
Alto Palermo mall. Psychologists are indeed expounding on the
topic. Mauricio Abadi, a leading Buenos Aires analyst, told
Noticias, "Maybe the experience of disastrous losses during
war, economic crashes or hyperinflation has taught us to give
up a certain feeling of omnipotence that made us think we
could shield ourselves from future losses. So everything now
centers on the urgency of instant gratification."
   For instant gratification, Argentines have a new place to
go: the mall.
   For years, Argentina remained impervious to the retailing
revolution that replaced small shops with department stores,
supermarkets and shopping centers. Now, that revolution is
hitting the country with a vengeance. "No matter how
backwards we are, we have to follow the world," says Mr.
Polensvaig. "And the world is shopping at the malls."
   So Buenos Aires is getting malls. Lots of them. The first
big one, Patio Bullrich, opened a couple of years ago. Alto
Palermo opened in mid-October; one million people visited it
in the first two weeks. At least three more are in the works.
   If Argentina is in crisis, it doesn't show at Alto
Palermo. A gleaming $45 million structure of glass, marble,
granite and chrome, the mall has everything a yuppie would
want: four levels and 180 shops, including Calvin Klein,
Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. There's a shop that
sells just Lacoste shirts and another selling Sergio Tacchini
sportswear. And there're McDonalds, not one, but three.
Everything is open seven days a week, 12 hours a day.
   At La Triestina, a Luger rifle sells for 8 million
Australes ($1,600). Aeromodelismo Canning sells
remote-control operated airplanes for up to $2,500. "Sales
are good," says its manager, Alberto Serafini. Space Station,
Mr. Polensvaig's import shop, sells a $14,000 solarium, a
$3,100 motorized rubber dinghy and other essentials, like a
transparent neon-lit telephone. "It's basically
impulse-buying," he says. "Some of the things I sell are
useless," Mr. Polensvaig concedes. "But they're imported.
Last time we had something imported was in 1980. People here
are hungry for something new."
