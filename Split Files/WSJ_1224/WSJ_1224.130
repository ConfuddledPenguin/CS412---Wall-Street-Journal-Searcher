   TOKYO -- An advisory panel to Japan's Fair Trade
Commission recommended that fines against large companies
engaged in illegal cartels be raised to 6% of relevant sales
from the current level of about 1.5%.
   The recommendation follows Japan's pledge during the
Structural Impediments Initiative trade talks with the U.S.
earlier this year to strengthen the country's weak
anti-monopoly regulations.

<TEXT>
   The proposed 6% level would still leave Japan's
anti-monopoly surcharges below those typically charged in the
U.S. and the European Community. The U.S. also wants Japan to
strengthen criminal enforcement against illegal cartels and
to make it easier for private parties to bring civil suits
against companies engaged in cartels.
