   TOKYO -- Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. faces at least
two to three more years of depressed earnings, President
Masashi Kojima said.
   The extended dreary outlook for the company, the world's
largest in terms of market capitalization, surprised some
analysts, most of whom had concluded NTT's financial problems
were bottoming out.

   Japanese law allows only Japanese citizens to own NTT
stock, but the government is considering allowing foreign
ownership and is expected to make a decision early next year.
   Mr. Kojima, who took over as president earlier this year,
said at a press luncheon Friday that "for a few years, we
will be in a difficult situation in increasing" profit.
   The struggles of the partly privatized giant, he
complained, come from facing new, deregulated competition in
areas such as domestic long-distance calls, while still
answering to regulators on rates and other matters. He also
attributed the expected earnings drop to enormous capital
spending required to modernize Japan's telephone system.
   "NTT is in a very difficult situation," the wry, outspoken
executive said. "I'd like to retire shortly, as long as
somebody would succeed me."
   An NTT spokesman later explained that, specifically, the
company expects pretax profit to drop more than 10% to about
400 billion yen ($2.96 billion) for the year ending March 31,
1992, and to remain flat for fiscal 1993. That compares with
NTT's pretax profit forecast of 447 billion yen for fiscal
1991, and with analysts' projections of 430 billion to 450
billion. Mr. Kojima said he expects 400 billion yen will be
rock-bottom.
   The NTT spokesman said the company hopes earnings will
rebound after the next couple of years.
   Michael Jeremy, an analyst with the Tokyo office of Baring
Securities Ltd., expressed some skepticism about Mr. Kojima's
remarks, noting that NTT has some incentive to dampen
earnings expectations to avoid unfavorable regulatory action.
"The tune will change," he said, "according to whom they're
trying to please."
   NTT's sliding earnings have been one of the many causes
for the much-publicized plunge in its stock price -- a drop
of about 70% since its 1987 peak of 3.18 million yen a share.
Mr. Kojima disclosed Friday that he, as have many small
investors in Japan, also had been hurt financially as a
result. His personal portfolio, he said he once calculated,
had lost 20 million to 30 million yen in value from its peak
price.
   But Mr. Kojima said he is holding on to the shares until
his retirement. "So NTT's stock has to go up," he said.
"Otherwise, I will face a difficult retirement."
   NTT had fiscal 1990 pretax earnings of 484.7 billion yen.
The company is capitalized at about 15 trillion yen. Its
shares closed unchanged Friday at 1,010,000 yen.
