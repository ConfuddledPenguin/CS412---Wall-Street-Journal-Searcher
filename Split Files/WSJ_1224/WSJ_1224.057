   Ever since Mikhail Gorbachev took the reins of power in
the Kremlin in March 1985 the world has been fascinated with
the persona of this backwater party official who shook up the
Soviet state and the international system. Different
observers have ascribed different sources to the dynamic of
the revolution sweeping through the Soviet empire.
   Moshe Lewin in his masterful book "The Gorbachev
Phenomenon" argued that the changes we are witnessing in the
U.S.S.R. are not due to Gorbachev the person, but rather are
a reflection of systemic crisis in a 19th-century political
system that may have been functional in a predominantly
peasant society but has lost its vitality in an urban,
educated and industrial system. Jerry Hough in his study of
Mr. Gorbachev saw the current changes in the Soviet Union as
a symptom of the re-emergence of the historic schism in
Russia's body-politic between the Slavophiles, who feel that
the Soviet Union ought to develop its own political and
economic models, and the Westernizers, who feel that Russia
must join the rest of civilization by adopting Western
political and economic models.

   Gail Sheehy's "The Man Who Changed the World: The Lives of
Mikhail Gorbachev" (Harper/Collins, 401 pages, $22.95) avoids
either of these broad conceptions, and instead attempts to
trace the intellectual and psychological development of Mr.
Gorbachev from his early days as a peasant boy in the
foothills of the Caucasus to his rise to the pinnacle of
power in the world's last empire. According to Ms. Sheehy,
Mr. Gorbachev's life has been one of constant conflict
between an inherently decent person traumatized by Stalin's
terror, which directly affected his family (both of his
grandfathers were arrested), and a person who is at the same
time a believer in the general premise of Soviet style
Marxism-Leninism.
   To write this biography, Ms. Sheehy interviewed an
exhausting number of Mr. Gorbachev's friends and associates,
ranging from his Politburo colleagues to childhood
sweethearts. The portrait of Mr. Gorbachev that emerges is
one of a man who attempted to right what seemed to him -- at
the time -- a series of political and economic wrongs in a
basically healthy system; a man who launched a series of
reforms without realizing the magnitude of the forces he was
unleashing. The interesting aspect of the Gorbachev mindset
that Ms. Sheehy brings out is that once confronted by a
rapidly changing set of circumstances that he did not
anticipate, Mr. Gorbachev, the skilled politician, managed to
turn the situation to his advantage.
   Thus, for example, he managed to preside over the
dissolution of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe without
much political fallout in the U.S.S.R. Ms. Sheehy correctly
points out that Mr. Gorbachev's ultimate Achilles' heel may
well turn out to be his lack of a vision for his vast nation
and his inability to break totally with the suffocating
Communist Party, of which he himself is a product. Although
Mr. Gorbachev is rightly credited with ending fear as a tool
of governance of Russia and sharply curtailing censorship and
other oppressive institutions, he has never had the political
courage to face a competitive election or an independent
legislature.
   As a result, while Mr. Gorbachev has done much to
dismantle the Stalinist legacy, he has failed to bring about
the emergence of new political and economic institutions that
could halt the disintegration of the country's economy and
avert the deepening crisis of confidence haunting Soviet
society. It is this Hamlet-like approach to internal reforms
in the Soviet Union that resulted in the collapse of the old
economic model without the emergence of a new one, leading to
hyperinflation and severe food shortages in many of the
country's cities. If one were to follow this logic to its
ultimate conclusion, Mr. Gorbachev has outlived his political
usefulness. The resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze means a
further setback for reforms.
   Ms. Sheehy's book is a useful contribution to the
understanding of the dilemmas currently confronting the
Kremlin. What severely affects the credibility of the book is
Ms. Sheehy's highly speculative application of pop psychology
to a man she does not really know and never met. For example,
she deduces, quite unconvincingly, that Mr. Gorbachev is
attracted to strong-willed women because he reached puberty
during the German occupation, at a time when most of his
village population consisted of women and children.
   Another irritating aspect of the book is its numerous
factual errors. To cite but a few: The Ukrainian language was
not banned by the Stalin regime as Ms. Sheehy would have it;
Lenin did not consolidate power with the New Economic Plan of
1921; the Politburo does not run the country through the KGB
but through the party bureaucracy, and has not done so since
Stalin's death in 1953; Mr. Gorbachev was not the first
Soviet leader to visit Britain -- Khrushchev did so in 1955
and Kosygin in 1966; and Baku is on the Black Sea, not the
Caspian Sea.
   It is clear that the book was written by an astute
observer of Soviet life, with a weak background in the
country's history. Nevertheless, it makes for entertaining
and at times instructive reading.

   Correction
                                                                                                       

   We would like to reassure readers that Baku remains on the
Caspian not the Black Sea (as suggested in the Dec. 24 book
review of Gail Sheehy's "The Man Who Changed the World: The
Lives of Mikhail Gorbachev").
