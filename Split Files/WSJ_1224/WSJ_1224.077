   EC TO BAN CFCS BY MID-1997

   European Community environment ministers agreed to ban
chlorofluorocarbons by mid-1997.
   "This new regulation will give a strong signal to the rest
of the world that we . . . are determined to stop using the
chemicals which damage the . . . ozone layer as quickly as
possible," British Environment Minister David Trippier said.
   The ministers also agreed to toughen car-pollution curbs,
which now are less rigorous than those in the U.S. EC
Environment Commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana said the EC
would soon propose fuel-efficiency standards for cars and a
communitywide speed limit.
   Italian Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo said the
limits would cut auto emissions of carbon monoxide by 57%.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS AIR-SAFETY CONCERNS
                                                                                                       

   Swiss authorities issued preliminary recommendations aimed
at increasing air safety, five weeks after an Alitalia
airline smashed into a hillside, killing all 46 people on
board. In a preliminary report on the crash, the Accident
Investigation Office said there was a need for improvements
in Swiss air-traffic-control procedures and in lighting. It
also indicated shortcomings in Alitalia landing rules. Flight
AZ404 from Milan crashed into a hill at Zurich's Kloten
airport Nov. 14.
                                                                                                       

   LOANS FOR CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Japan announced loans of up to 42.6 billion yen ($315.7
million) for China, the second portion of a loan package that
had been frozen soon after the crackdown on pro-democracy
protests in Beijing last year and that resumed in November.
The latest loans are for five projects to update port,
highway, telecommunications, air-traffic-control and railway
systems.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA LOOKS AHEAD
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will aim for economic growth of around 7% in
1991, lower than the 9% expected this year, the Economic
Planning Board said. The targeted growth rate in real terms
would be the second worst in five years; the worst was 1989's
6.7% growth. Announcing the government's economic-management
plan for 1991, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Seung Yun said the
nation's export-oriented economy would be hurt by such
factors as higher oil prices and a global economic slowdown
connected with the Gulf crisis and overseas trade
protectionism.
                                                                                                       

   AN APPEAL FROM THE FAO
                                                                                                       

   The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's
director-general, Edouard Saouma, called for more food aid to
African nations threatened by famine. "If the world has been
capable of breaking down the political barrier between East
and West, it should be able to attack the economic divide
between North and South," Mr. Saouma said in a year-end
message on the state of world food and agriculture. Ethiopia
and Sudan need massive assistance to avoid famine in 1991,
the FAO chief said.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S POPULATION GROWTH
                                                                                                       

   Japan's population is growing at its slowest rate since
World War II, a preliminary report on the 1990 census showed.
The population totaled 123,611,541 on Oct. 1, up only 2.1%
from 1985, the last time a census was taken. The previous
record low growth was 3.4% in the five years from 1980 to
1985. Surveys of Japanese business show almost all
respondents feel affected by the low birth rate. Those unable
to fill jobs with Japanese workers are turning increasingly
to illegal-immigrant labor.
                                                                                                       

   A VERY LARGE JET
                                                                                                       

   Airbus Industrie is studying the possibility of a very
large commercial jet that would allow it to attack its rival
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in the Boeing Co. unit's
most lucrative market.
   The giant aircraft envisaged by Airbus designers would be
capable of carrying up to 700 passengers and would have a
range of at least 7,000 miles, enabling airlines to fly
comfortably nonstop from Europe to Sydney, for example.
   Airbus officials say the new plane would be designed to
attack Boeing head-on in the high-capacity commercial-jet
market where it has enjoyed a monopoly up to now thanks to
the Boeing 747 jumbo jet that first entered service 20 years
ago.
   Jean Pierson, Airbus Industrie's chief executive,
indicated in a recent newspaper interview that if the Airbus
partners decide to go ahead with the idea, the aircraft could
enter the development stage in 1997 and enter service with
airlines in 2002. Airbus Industrie's partners are
Aerospatiale of France; Messerschmitt-BoelkowBlohm G.m.b.H.,
a unit of Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany; British Aerospace
PLC; and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Irish children are fatter and less fit than their
counterparts in other parts of Europe, according to a survey
by Ireland's National Youth Council. Ten-year-old Irish boys
were shown to be 7.5 pounds heavier than their British
equivalents and 3.5 pounds fatter than Dutch boys. . . .
North Korea has notified the Soviet Union's Novosti press
agency and Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper to close their
bureaus in Pyongyang, the Yonhap News Agency of South Korea
reported. The order is believed to be a sign of displeasure
with the recent visit of South Korean President Roh Tae Woo
to the Soviet Union.
