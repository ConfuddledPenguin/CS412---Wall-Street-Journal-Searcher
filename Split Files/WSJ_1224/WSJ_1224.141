   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it signed two
preliminary agreements to explore, develop and produce oil
and gas in parts of eastern Siberia in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.
   The oil giant said the agreements were with the regional
councils of the Chukotka Autonomous Area and of Madagan, on
the east coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Arco said the
agreements are the first step toward securing "exclusive
rights" for onshore and offshore oil exploration and
development in the region.

   Arco said the agreements mark its first business foray
into the Soviet Union.
   "This is a very preliminary agreement," an Arco
spokeswoman said. There's no timetable for completing a final
agreement or to begin operations there, she said. The
regional councils will help Arco obtain required legal
approvals of the Russian Federation and the U.S.S.R., Arco
said.
   It wasn't clear why Arco believes it needs approval from
the Russian Federation, which is in a different part of the
U.S.S.R. The spokeswoman said company officials who might be
able to answer the question weren't available.
