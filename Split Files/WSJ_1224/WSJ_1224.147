   Edison, N.J. -- When compact discs were first introduced
with the slogan "perfect sound forever," serious audiophiles
knew better. They had only to compare the vital sound of
their cherished copies of Mercury Living Presence recordings,
made 30 years ago, with those shrill early CDs to become
militantly anti-digital. In fact, one consequence of the
digital revolution was to make some of the rarer copies of
original Mercury records -- which many collectors feel are
the most strikingly lifelike recordings ever made -- worth as
much as $1,000.
   But now that Philips Classics, which owns the Mercury
catalog, has reissued 10 Living Presence titles on CD, not
only are audiophiles changing their tune about digital, but
Mercurymania is spreading throughout record stores. And for
good reason. Philips has been uncommonly painstaking in its
digital transfers, and CDs have never before sounded as if
they had such, well, living presence.

   Still, this is a phenomenon that caught Philips and the
retailers by surprise. Surely no one at Philips expected
record collectors to actually invade their Manhattan offices
when the stores quickly sold out of many titles only days
after they were released. And never has the distinguished
Dutch classical music label had such fan mail before. One
grateful Mercury enthusiast, who had been distraught over the
loss of his LP collection in the San Francisco earthquake
last year, sent Philips a photograph of his crumbling Marina
apartment building taken a day after the disaster.
   What makes all of this so extraordinary is that Mercury
was little more than a mom-and-pop label that made records
during the '50s and early '60s, and its roster of performers
-- which includes the cellist Pierre Fournier; the pianist
Byron Janis; the conductors Antal Dorati, Stanislaw
Skrowaczewski and Paul Paray; the Detroit and Minneapolis
symphonies -- is hardly stellar by modern standards. Yet
Fournier's 1962 recording of the Dvorak Cello Concerto right
now readily outsells other CD versions played by such
celebrity cellists as Casals, Rostropovich, Yo Yo Ma and
Andrew Lloyd Webber's brother, Julian.
   The mom and pop of Mercury were a couple of recording
purists, C. Robert Fine and Wilma Cozart Fine, who allowed as
little sonic adulteration as they could in the final product.
They did minimal amounts of tape splicing, always recording
whole movements in single takes. They used a single
microphone for their monaural records, and only three mikes
for stereo, which meant no artificial highlighting of
instruments in an orchestra. They permitted no electronic
doctoring, no boosting highs or lows. Sticklers for detail,
they carefully oversaw every aspect of the production of the
final product, much of it made on Mr. Fine's custom
equipment. And in the mid '60s they closed up shop, because
Mrs. Fine wanted to raise a family.
   Two years ago, with the kids grown and Mr. Fine deceased,
Mrs. Fine was enticed back into the studio to oversee the
digital transfers of the Mercury catalog, and it turns out
she has lost none of her golden-ear perfectionism. Avoiding
the assembly-line nature of most CD reissuing, Mrs. Fine has
handpicked every bit of equipment used, and she has even gone
so far as to insist that the master tapes be digitally
transferred from the original tube recording equipment used
to make them.
   The result is sound indistinguishable from the original
masters, as was apparent during a demonstration Mrs. Fine
held for journalists in the Polygram studio here, where she
spent two years tirelessly working on the transfers of these
first 10 reissues. Critical listeners who compare the CDs
with the LPs may, in fact, hear a difference, since the LPs
have an added smoothness that many listeners favor, but that
is actually a distortion of the master tape.
   Ultimately, though, it is not the demonstration quality of
the sound that makes these discs so astonishing, although
they do make even modest equipment sound terrific. Rather it
is that the Fines managed to capture the sense of a
performance really happening, and that ephemeral quality
alone can make these releases preferable to other, even
musically finer, recordings of the same work.
   For instance, Skrowaczewski's account of Prokofiev's
"Romeo and Juliet" suites with the Minneapolis Symphony,
recorded in 1962, is not nearly so gorgeously played as, say,
Riccardo Muti's with the Philadelphia Orchestra (Angel) or as
profoundly conducted as Evgeny Mravinsky's classic Leningrad
recording (Philips). But not those two or any other recorded
versions of these suites is as physically alive as the
Mercury disc, where the sound grabs a listener through its
sheer visceral qualities alone. Skrowaczewski does, however,
deserve credit for a highly dramatic interpretation and some
really monumental climaxes.
   Other highlights in the series include a Respighi disc,
conducted by Dorati, with a mesmeric version of "The Birds,"
and surely the splashiest sounding recording of that
intemperate orchestral exercise, "The Fountains of Rome."
Dorati also oversees a sonically resonant disc of
20th-century Viennese masterpieces by Schoenberg, Berg and
Webern.
   But wonderful as many Mercurys are, it is sometimes hard
to completely understand the Fines' taste. In 1962, they were
the first American cold warriors to take recording equipment
into the Soviet Union to record Soviet musicians. But instead
of capturing really important Soviet musicians playing
Russian music, they brought us the erratic American pianist
Byron Janis playing the two Liszt concertos with the Moscow
Radio Symphony and a dopey disc of balalaika favorites in
glamorous sound.
   On the other hand, the Fines were admirable in their
support of American music, and one of the most valuable
recordings of this first issue features Howard Hanson
conducting his first two symphonies, the "Nordic" and
"Romantic" -- big, old-fashioned works that have become newly
popular but that don't sound half as impressive on modern
recordings as they do here.
   Collectors don't seem to care about the unevenness,
though. They like the sound of these discs so much that they
are buying them all (at midprice, and since all of them run
over 60 minutes, they happen to be great bargains) and
eagerly awaiting the next batch to come out early next year.
