   The Boston Globe, citing advertising declines, said it
will reduce its work force by 100 full-time positions through
attrition over the next five years.
   The newspaper's advertising revenue for the first 11
months of 1990 is running 10.7% behind the like period for
1989, said a Boston Globe official.

   The Globe is a unit of Affiliated Publications Inc.
   "We find this is the least painful way to become cost
effective in a declining economy," said a Globe spokesman.
"And, frankly, we don't expect 1991 to be any better than
1990 in terms of ad revenues."
   The spokesman said the Globe will naturally lose 100
positions, about 5% of its fulltime staff, by not filling
positions that become vacant, except in special cases. The
attrition program is another step in the newspaper's overall
cost-cutting effort started in spring 1988, which has meant
reductions in department expenditures and in hours of
part-time staff.
   William O. Taylor, publisher of the Globe and chairman of
Affiliated Publications, said the company plans to raise
revenue by increasing the price of the Globe to 50 cents,
from 35 cents, in areas 30 miles or more from Boston.
