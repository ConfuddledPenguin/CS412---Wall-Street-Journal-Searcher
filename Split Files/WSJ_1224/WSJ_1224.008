   Pan Am Corp. and Trans World Airlines Inc. owner Carl
Icahn continued talks through the weekend on how to arrange a
loan to keep Pan Am afloat and clear the way for the
financier's acquisition of the airline.
   Mr. Icahn's camp and Pan Am representatives were trying to
hash out how such a loan should be constructed. Mr. Icahn
seeks a complicated arrangement that would require Pan Am to
file for bankruptcy-court protection. Pan Am Chairman Thomas
Plaskett, although still negotiating, is understood to be
against such a prerequisite.

   On Friday, Mr. Plaskett sent Mr. Icahn a letter expressing
interest in considering Mr. Icahn's tentative proposal to buy
Pan Am's 150 million shares outstanding for $1.50 each, or
$225 million, plus $1 a share in subordinated notes. Pan Am
shares closed Friday at $1.50, up 12.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   But Mr. Plaskett said Pan Am first needs a loan so it can
survive the slow winter months. In a letter to TWA employees
late Friday, Mr. Icahn said he would only give Pan Am cash as
part of so-called "debtor-in-possession" financing usually
arranged before a company reorganizes in bankruptcy court.
TWA would get a priority lien on unsecured Pan Am assets and
would be the first creditor in line for repayment.
   Pan Am executives were understood to be annoyed that Mr.
Icahn had publicly raised the prospect that Pan Am could file
for bankruptcy-court protection. But Mr. Icahn has grounds
for concern about lending Pan Am money because the company
has delayed payments many times to creditors.
   Mr. Icahn is said to be willing to provide Pan Am with a
loan of $75 million to $100 million. He apparently found no
banks willing to join in the investment. While the method of
lending that Mr. Icahn prefers would protect his investment,
it would also make any acquisition more complicated because
it would involve bankruptcy court. He is apparently trying to
figure out how a merger could follow.
   Pan Am executives are under pressure because of an impasse
reached Friday in talks between the U.S. and British
governments over whether to approve a $400 million accord for
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit to buy Pan Am's service to
London's Heathrow airport. Pan Am had been lobbying for
approval by year's end so it could get the cash, but it now
seems there won't be a decision until at least mid-January.
   In addition to negotiating on a U.S.-U.K. pact that
restricts new U.S. carriers coming into Heathrow, Britain
apparently must change a domestic traffic-distribution law
that doesn't allow any new foreign carrier into Heathrow.
   As part of the pact with United, Pan Am is expected to get
$20 million as early as today for San Francisco facilities. A
further $10 million is trickling in for spare parts and other
small assets. Pan Am has already received $80 million for two
Boeing Co. jets but has had to spend much of that money on
debt on the planes.
   A person familiar with Pan Am's balance sheet said the
money could help the carrier operate until mid-January. That
assumes, however, that none of Pan Am's big creditors will
force the carrier to pay overdue bills. Pan Am executives are
also hoping to get a boost from Christmas holiday revenue.
   The worsening financial straits of Pan Am are apparently
worrying investors other than Mr. Icahn. United executives
are known to be leery of giving Pan Am a cash advance.
   Meanwhile, it has been learned that NWA Inc.'s Northwest
Airlines has arranged financing with PacifiCorp, Portland,
Ore., to buy Pan Am's New York-Boston-Washington shuttle for
about $150 million, according to people familiar with the
arrangement. Northwest would operate the shuttle with an
option to buy it from PacifiCorp.
   Union leaders were told this month that a sale was
imminent but later were told it had been delayed. There are
apparently questions about how any sale would affect union
contracts. Completion of the sale might also be complicated
by any Pan Am reorganization.
