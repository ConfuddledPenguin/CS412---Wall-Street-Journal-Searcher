   Winnebago Industries Inc. said its loss for the first
quarter, ended Dec. 1, widened to $8 million, or 32 cents a
share, from $4.6 million, or 19 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue dropped 48% to $40.7 million from $78.9
million.
   The Forest City, Iowa, maker of motor homes blamed the
industry slump on "Iraq's actions in the Middle East and
concerns about a slowing economy." The Mideast crisis raises
fears among motor home buyers about the availability and
price of gasoline.
