   NEW YORK -- An elementary school here in one of the
nation's grimmest slums is at the forefront of a drive to
change science education throughout the U.S.
   The goal: to raise the abysmal level of science literacy
and help kids realize that scientific inquiry is a way to
learn about the world and solve important problems. The
method: teach science, through experimentation, to the
youngest children. "If you miss kids when they're young,
you've lost them" to science, says Allan Bromley, President
Bush's science adviser.

   This day, 25 kindergarteners at P.S. 7 in East Harlem sit
down to study science. Each child has a snail, a pencil and a
magnifying glass. Take a close look at the snails, says
science teacher Treva Powell, as the mollusks wriggle on the
desks. What do you see?
   Amid groans and giggles, the five-year-olds peer through
their magnifying glasses and watch the snails recoil from
their touch and slime up their desks. Then the children start
drawing -- some adding a smile to a snail's face, others
sketching the circular patterns of the shells. "I want these
kids to develop skills like observation and prediction," says
Ms. Powell. "In my class, we do science."
   Teaching science through experiments is "the best way to
teach democracy," says Mary Budd Rowe, a veteran professor of
science education at Stanford University. "You use concrete
data, and see that experts interpret things in different
ways." The method has the greatest impact, she adds, on poor
kids who don't get to play often with science or construction
toys.
   But science rarely gets taught in elementary school --
less than 30 minutes a day on average. And what little
instruction does take place usually involves memorization.
Teachers are partly to blame, educators say. Many are
frightened off by science material, and don't like the mess
and noise of experimentation. School administrators are
responsible, too, critics say. They frequently judge teachers
by their ability to increase reading and math scores, and
ignore science.
   Efforts to change that mind-set are under way across the
country. The University of Pennsylvania has signed up 110
science and math majors to coach classes in 20 Philadelphia
elementary schools. Teams of four Penn students get groups of
15 grade-schoolers to try such ambitious projects as
designing a Mars colony, and show the kids that science can
be adventurous. The groups even stay overnight at the
Franklin Institute, do experiments in chemistry and
electricity at the science museum and -- every kid's dream --
camp out in sleeping bags under the dinosaurs.
   In California, the Department of Education plans to
require that elementary school children statewide take a
science test that revolves around experimentation -- prodding
local districts to add and improve science lessons. One part
of the test would require kids to design an electric circuit,
build it, predict what objects will conduct electricity and
test their predictions. "We're moving away from teaching
factoids and moving to teaching themes, like energy," says
Kathleen Comfort, a California education consultant.
   One of the most ambitious projects in science education is
taking place here in East Harlem, a black and Hispanic
neighborhood battered by poverty, crime and drugs. The local
school district won a three-year, $620,000 National Science
Foundation grant to train intensively one teacher in each of
the neighborhood's 30 elementary schools in the latest
techniques in science education. These teachers then serve as
mentors to their colleagues.
   But the program has its share of troubles. Mentors face
resistance from teachers who don't like the new methods and
resent being told to change. The local junior high schools
don't continue the experimental approach. And critics say
hands-on instruction by itself won't lead to long-term gains
in understanding.
   Charles Anderson, an education professor at Michigan State
University, says teachers must mix experiments with lectures,
or kids won't learn the underlying principles. "It took
scientists thousands of years to come up with the idea of
photosynthesis," he says. "Left to their own, kids would take
that long, too."
   Ms. Powell, an animated 39-year-old teacher, is P.S. 7's
science mentor. A Harlem resident, she sees herself as a role
model for neighborhood kids and needles them to get back to
school when she sees them hanging around on the streets. She
stocks her room with fish, animals and plants that she
figures her students don't see at home.
   Each class in the school troops into her room at least
once a week to do 45-minute experiments. On a recent Tuesday
morning, she teaches kindergarteners about snails and shows
sixth-graders the concept of prediction and test with bags of
M&amp;Ms. Then she introduces fifth-graders to the difficulty of
cleaning up ocean pollution.
   Devise a plan to skim oil from water, she tells the
fifth-graders, building on a previous experiment for
purifying salt water. For the next class, she plans to buy
the materials the kids say they need and have them start
their experiments.
   One group of girls comes up with an intricate scheme:
"First clip a feather in the water with oil to see how thick
it is. Put a rubber ball inside the oily water to see if
water can make things float. Then use cotton to absorb the
oil."
   Later, Ms. Powell explains that the girls had seen a
picture in a textbook of a bird covered with oil and figured
feathers would somehow be useful for cleaning up spills.
Letting them discover their mistake will take valuable class
time, she says, but will also teach them about trial and
error.
   Once or twice a week, Ms. Powell leaves school to take
science lessons herself, learning, say, to teach the water
cycle by turning plastic soda bottles into terrariums. Local
principals are invited to the training sessions, to win their
support for the program.
   "People are afraid of science," says Robert Negron, P.S.
7's principal. "Everyone means to do well but we become rote"
teachers. Indeed, an earlier movement to teach science
through experimentation was aborted in the mid-1970s when
schools retreated to textbook instruction as part of the
"back to basics" era.
   Ms. Powell wants to make sure the changes stick this time.
On a Wednesday morning, she packs 25 snails in a bowl, grabs
handfuls of magnifying glasses and plastic balances, and
heads off to show third-grade teacher Cynthia Aquart what she
has learned about teaching science. Ms. Aquart is a veteran
teacher known at P.S. 7 as a disciplinarian who can squeeze
better reading scores out of her students.
   Ms. Powell figures the best help she can offer as a mentor
is getting teachers used to hands-on activities. So she
passes out the snails and wanders the room as the kids poke
the mollusks, weigh them on the balances and jot down
observations.
   "Gross," yells one boy in disgust.
   "Did he make your desk slimy?" asks Ms. Powell.
   "Yeah, look," he says, pointing to an oily slick. She
nudges him to make a note.
   As the lesson progresses and the kids get more excited and
noisy, Ms. Aquart becomes uneasy, prowling the room and
finally shutting off the lights to quiet them. Before they
have a chance to finish weighing the snails, she tells Ms.
Powell the experiment is over. The children must get ready
for gym, Ms. Aquart says. Ms. Powell asks her to complete the
experiment later in the day; she demurs.
   Back in her own classroom, the usually effervescent Ms.
Powell is dejected: "When I saw what was going on, I said,
`Uh, oh.'" There was too much mess and noise to suit Ms.
Aquart, she realizes.
   But Ms. Powell vows not to give up. She pulls out journals
that other third-graders kept while growing mystery bulbs.
They weren't told what the bulbs were or whether they would
bloom.
   One entry from Oct. 26 reads: "Some people measured the
plant. Fifteen people thought it was onions. I wonder is it
going to open? We don't know. But I am going to go on and on
until I find out]
   "Your scientist, Victoria Allende."
   Then, on Nov. 19, Victoria added this postscript: "A
flower grew out of it]"
