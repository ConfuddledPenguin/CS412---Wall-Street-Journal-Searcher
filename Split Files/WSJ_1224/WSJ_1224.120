   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank placed all its $51.4 million
of loans to Iraq on nonaccrual status, signifying that nation
is more than six months overdue on interest payments.
   Nonaccrual means that the World Bank will now only count
Iraqi interest payments it receives and won't automatically
accrue payments that are due.

   As the international agency noted, Iraq's assets have been
frozen since August, when it invaded Kuwait. It has therefore
been unable to make payments to the World Bank.
   Altogether, Iraq now has about $10.2 million of overdue
payments, the World Bank said, consisting of $7.1 million of
principal and $3.1 million of interest payments and other
charges.
