   Greater New York Savings Bank said it expects to post
losses for the fourth quarter and full year because of an
increase in nonperforming assets.
   The New York bank, citing a deterioration of the
commercial real estate market, said it expects to report a
loss of between $20 million and $25 million for the current
quarter and $15 million to $20 million for the full year. It
also plans to omit its dividend on common stock.

   In the 1989 fourth quarter, the bank posted net income of
$1.4 million, or seven cents a share, and declared a 12 cent
dividend. It reported a profit of 19.3 million, or $1.37 a
share, for the whole of 1989.
   Greater New York Savings said its nonperforming assets are
expected to more than triple to $260 million from $83.8
million in the 1989 quarter. Nonperforming assets stood at
$145 million Sept. 30. The bank expects to add $25 million to
$30 million to its loan-loss reserves. Following chargeoffs
during the quarter, the balance in the reserves will total
about $40 million to $45 million. Loan-loss provisions were
$3.7 million in the 1989 quarter and $3.5 million in the
third quarter.
