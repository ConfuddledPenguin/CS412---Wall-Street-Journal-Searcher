   During the recent Polish presidential campaign, Lech
Walesa paused to ask, "Why is the West making a tyrant out of
me?" He might well wonder. Even as he faces difficulties
forming a new government, the man who could do no wrong for
10 years is suddenly being portrayed as a
cryptoauthoritarian.
   It is not only Mr. Walesa who has suddenly gone out of
vogue. His critics see a wave of "populism" sweeping all
across Eastern Europe. "Super-patriots" are winning
elections, citizens are voting along ethnic lines. Even
Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel is asking for emergency powers,
including the power to dissolve Parliament. All of this is
being interpreted as a sign that these peoples, because of
their "limited experience" with democracy, maybe aren't ready
for self-rule after all.

   What is really happening is that East European democracies
are exiting from their cuddly stages, and are beginning to
reflect the real issues in the region. This means that the
dissident intellectuals who came to power in 1989, and who
have become favorites in Western intellectual circles, are
hitting the rocks.
   Poland is the clearest example. The recent election was
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's to lose. A few months ago, the Polish
leader had overwhelming support and almost two-thirds of
those surveyed said they did not want to see Mr. Walesa as
president. But many of the Solidarity intellectuals who
surrounded Mr. Mazowiecki showed contempt for the Polish
people.
   Andrzej Szcypiorski, a member of the Senate and a leading
member of Solidarity's intellectual faction, expressed the
sentiments not uncommon in that group: "Walesa and the
workers say with pride, `We are the simple people.' I say it
is high time to get a little more complicated. They do not
realize that in contemporary Western life real power is held
by managers and professionals." Of the working class, Mr.
Szcypiorski said, "They have low morale, low achievement and
weak characters."
   Adam Michnik is the Solidarity intellectual who has
emerged as everybody's favorite quote-meister. He typically
calls Mr. Walesa a burgeoning Peronist or a Mussolini. He
predicts that Mr. Walesa "will not be president of a
democratic Poland. Rather, he will become a destabilizing
factor, creating chaos, and isolating Poland from the rest of
the world."
   The Polish people sensed that this was a class war and had
no trouble deciding which side they were on. By electing Mr.
Walesa, they were not protesting the pain inflicted by Mr.
Mazowiecki's economic reforms. Indeed, Mr. Walesa pledges to
continue the economic reforms started under Finance Minister
Leszek Balcerowicz. He understands that the people want
economic reform accelerated.
   The intellectual technocrats, victims of their own
managerial caution, slowed privatization to a snail's pace.
Nor did the technocrats understand how it offended the people
to be called on to make sacrifices, while the old communist
nomenklatura stayed in office. The Mazowiecki regime had made
a compact with the communists to ensure an "orderly"
transition. Communists paid lip service to the market, but
what they meant was something very similar to welfarestate
socialism.
   Intellectual elites are rarely pleased with the
rough-and-tumble world of true democracy. They sniff at the
simple patriotism of a Lech Walesa or a Ronald Reagan. Yet
surely the cure for fragile democracy is not less democracy.
These populist movements in Eastern Europe are the fruition
of last year's revolutions. Populist governments are not only
more democratic than governments tailormade to suit the
elites, they are often also more sensible.
