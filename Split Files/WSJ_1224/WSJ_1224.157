   J.M. Peters Co. said its fiscal third-quarter revenue fell
45% to $40 million, resulting in a net loss of $7.1 million,
or 51 cents a share.
   The loss included a $3.1 million write-down on undeveloped
land the company has agreed to sell. The property is in
escrow and the sale is set to close early next year, the
company said.

   In the third quarter ended Nov. 30, 1989, the Newport
Beach, Calif., home building concern had net income of $5.7
million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $72.4 million.
   The company said its latest results "continue to mirror
the downturn in sales for single family move-up housing
throughout most of Southern California." Increased finance
and marketing costs on the company's unsold homes also
contributed to the loss. Gross profit percentages on sales
was 8.8% compared with 21.3% a year earlier.
   In the first nine months, the company had a net loss of $6
million, or 43 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net
income of $14.2 million, or $1.02 a share. Revenue fell 14%
to $161.9 million from $188.2 million.
