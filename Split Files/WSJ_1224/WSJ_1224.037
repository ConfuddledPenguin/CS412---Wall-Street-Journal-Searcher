   NEW YORK -- JPS Textile Group Inc. announced a $460
million debt restructuring plan, which it said it proposes to
carry out through a "prepackaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
filing.
   The prospect of a bankruptcy filing by JPS, the successor
company to much of J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., underscores the
growing financial difficulties of much of the U.S. textile
industry. At least eight major U.S. textile companies took on
big debts in the 1980s because of takeovers,
recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs. A deepening
recession in the textile industry now is making it difficult
for many of these companies to service their debts.

   JPS's troubles also are a setback for Odyssey Partners,
the New York investment bank that acquired the Greenville,
S.C., textile company in late 1988. Odyssey spent most of
last summer trying to negotiate an exchange offer for JPS's
bonds that didn't involve a bankruptcy-law filing, but
couldn't overcome bondholders' resistance.
   "We feel a reduction in the debt service of the company is
desirable," said Jerry Hunter, president of JPS. He asserted
that "the most efficient and least disruptive way to
implement our financial restructuring is through a
prepackaged Chapter 11 filing."
   In a prepackaged filing, a company wins creditors'
approval of a restructuring plan before filing for
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors. Such filings, in
theory at least, can be resolved much faster than ordinary
bankruptcy cases. JPS said holders of 62.3% of its bonds have
already approved its restructuring plan. It also said it
hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 within 60 to 90 days of
filing.
   In Chapter 11, a company gets court protection against
creditor lawsuits while it attempts to come up with a plan to
pay its debts.
   In its proposed restructuring, JPS is asking bondholders
to swap high-interest, cash-paying bonds for lower-interest
bonds that pay interest in a mixture of cash and more bonds.
It also is offering bondholders a total of 49% ownership in
the company. Meanwhile, JPS's owners, chiefly Odyssey, plan
to invest another $7.5 million in the company to achieve 51%
ownership.
   In a typical provision of the proposed restructuring,
holders of 15 1/4% notes due in 1999 are being offered 10
1/4% notes due in 1999 and 15% equity in the company.
   In an interview, JPS executives insisted that the
company's operations have been doing reasonably well this
year, but they acknowledged that the company still couldn't
handle its heavy debt load. For the nine months ended July
28, JPS posted a $26.2 million loss, as operating profit of
$34.7 million was overwhelmed by $60.9 million of interest
expense.
   Odyssey bought JPS in 1988 for $578 million, a price that
analysts say appears high in hindsight. Odyssey's original
game plan appears to have been to sell off major pieces of
JPS to pay down debt and turn a profit. That strategy was
quickly thwarted, though, as financing sources for potential
buyers have dried up over the past 18 months.
   JPS also has suffered because of high interest rates on
its high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, which were underwritten
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The rates of 14 1/4% to 15
1/4% were significantly higher than Odyssey had expected, an
Odyssey executive said.
   Bond traders Friday afternoon declined to quote prices on
JPS's junk bonds, but investors appeared to have marked down
the bonds in advance of news of the proposed Chapter 11
filing. Recent quotes for JPS's junk bonds have ranged from
20 cents on the dollar to 32 cents on the dollar.
   Major JPS bondholders include Drexel, First Executive
Corp., Allstate Life Insurance Co. and First Capital Corp.,
according to Odyssey and JPS executives.
