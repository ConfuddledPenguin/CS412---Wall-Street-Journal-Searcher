   Triangle Corp. said it is selling its special tools
business and issued a tender offer for debentures as part of
a restructuring aimed at reducing debt load.
   The Stamford, Conn., company said it expects to report a
net loss for the fourth quarter and year because of failure
to close a sale as scheduled.

   Sale of the special tools business to SPX Corp., Muskegon,
Mich., for $12 million is expected to close early next year.
Triangle will use $7 million to reduce bank debt.
   Triangle is also seeking to arrange a new long-term senior
credit facility -- a move that is currently prohibited by
covenants in its senior debentures. To modify that provision,
Triangle proposed to purchase 51% of the 13.75% debentures,
or at least $12.8 million principal amount, at $600 plus
accrued interest for each $1,000 principal amount.
   The company didn't complete the sale of a fuel injector
cleaning equipment product line to Parker Automotive Corp.
because of a breach of the purchase and sale agreement.
   In the 1989 fourth quarter, Triangle had a loss of
$120,000, or four cents a share, on sales of $21.3 million.
In 1989, it had a loss of $931,000 or 36 cents a share, on
$70.2 million in sales.
