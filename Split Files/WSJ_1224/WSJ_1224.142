   NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
chief rule-making body for accountants, is stepping up
efforts to defuse business criticism of its controversial
accounting rules.
   For example, the 205-page rule it just issued on
post-retirement health benefits includes a section, for the
first time in the FASB's 17-year history, justifying the rule
on a cost-benefit basis.

   The rule will reduce reported corporate profits at least
$200 billion starting in 1993, and many businessmen are upset
at the FASB for declining to ease the rule's impact on
earnings. In response to corporate criticism that some
accounting rules are too costly and complex, the Securities
and Exchange Commission has in recent months urged the FASB
to make sure its rules are worth implementing.
   In the new health-benefit rule, the FASB, based in
Norwalk, Conn., says many companies haven't properly
monitored or managed their health-benefit obligations for a
long time. The rule boosts the credibility of financial
statements by showing the real obligation of retiree health
benefits and will force companies to estimate these benefits
more accurately, the FASB adds. The rule forces companies to
accrue or set up a reserve for such benefits rather than
account for them on a "pay-as-you-go" basis each year, as is
current practice.
   Timothy Lucas, research director of the FASB, concedes
that the new cost-benefit section was included as a response
to criticism of business and government regulators. "We may
very well include such cost-benefit sections in future
statements {rules}, but we want to be sure they aren't just
boilerplate and address each rule's specific benefits."
   In recent months, the FASB has been the target of heavy
criticism from the committee on corporate reporting of the
13,500-member Financial Executives Institute and from the
accounting principles task force of the powerful Business
Roundtable. Since August, both the FEI and the Roundtable
have written letters to the SEC criticizing the FASB's rules
for being too detailed and too expensive to implement.
   The FASB usually sends only its own letter of comment to
the SEC in response to business criticism. But this time the
board became incensed that the FEI was criticizing FASB rules
on consolidation and cash flows that the FASB thought FEI had
supported. And so it sent a more stinging letter to the SEC
noting these so-called inconsistencies.
   The result was a private meeting called by the FEI and the
FASB Dec. 14 at a New York club to discuss their differences.
Says Mr. Lucas, who attended: "Not everyone kept their cool,
but nobody really lost their temper. While we don't think
that FEI will like everything the board does, the meeting may
help clear the air." Only three FASB board members attended.
If four had come, FASB rules would have required the meeting
to be open to the public.
   Norman Roy, FEI president, declining to discuss meeting
specifics, says the gettogether was part of a dialogue
between businessmen and the FASB on accounting rules.
   In response to its critics, the FASB next year will change
its voting procedure so that a 5-to-2 vote rather than the
current 4-to-3 vote is needed to issue new accounting rules.
Last year, the FASB began heading its task forces, which
draft new rules, with board members rather than staff, who
companies have thought are tougher on business. And in 1989,
the FASB also began sending a representative to attend
certain key FEI meetings on accounting.
