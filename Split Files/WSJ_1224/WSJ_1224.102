   HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Harsco Corp. said it has reached an
agreement with the U.S. Army to modify a contract that allows
the company to produce fewer five-ton trucks in exchange for
dismissing certain claims against the government.
   The industrial concern said cost problems related to its
five-ton truck contract had required it to build loss
reserves totaling $60 million. Harsco said it doesn't
anticipate having to add to its reserves as a result of the
new agreement.

   The new agreement calls for the company to provide the
government with 17,092 vehicles, as opposed to the original
contract calling for 21,000 trucks. Harsco said it has
already built and delivered 10,000 of those trucks.
   In return, Harso has agreed to drop certain claims,
representing about $55 million, against the government.
However, the company said it still continues to pursue claims
in excess of $55 million.
