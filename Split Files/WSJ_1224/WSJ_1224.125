   Curtiss-Wright Corp.'s Target Rock Corp. unit said it was
advised that the U.S. government filed a complaint against it
seeking $22 million and other penalties in connection with
military contracts.
   Target, based in East Farmingdale, N.Y., said the
complaint alleges that former employees embezzled funds from
the unit and as a result "damaged" the U.S. government.

   The government alleges that the employees made false
travel and expense reports, inflated invoices from suppliers
and mischarged labor hours to government subcontractors, the
company said.
   Target, which makes engineered valves for use in U.S. Navy
nuclear propulsion systems, said the "information currently
available to the company would not, in its opinion,
substantiate a claim for an amount even approaching the sum
claimed." Target said it intends to fight the suit
"vigorously."
   A spokesman said the company believes the government
charges result from an investigation conducted by
Curtiss-Wright, Lyndhurst, N.J., in March 1987. The probe
resulted in the indictment and guilty pleas of the former
employees and vendors. The company wasn't charged.
