   New state laws policing environmental pitches will give
big advertisers heartburn -- and could force some to drop
their "green marketing" claims altogether.
   The latest law, effective next week in California, sets
strict standards for terms such as "environmentally
friendly," "biodegradable" and "recyclable." In April, Rhode
Island starts enforcing an even tougher statute that bans
most green marketing as misleading. Companies risk fines of
up to $1,000 a day if they label packages "environmentally
safe," for example.

   Less-sweeping legislation to oversee environmental
advertising has passed recently in New York, Wisconsin and
New Hampshire. New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering
bills, too.
   The measures aim to end consumer confusion and cynicism
about green marketing, but a proliferation of conflicting
statutes could exacerbate the skepticism. The laws
undoubtedly will widen the clamor for the U.S. government to
adopt uniform standards. Federal action isn't imminent --
despite pressure from both a task force of 10 attorneys
general and a new working group of 20 big trade associations.
   Ad-industry executives and major manufacturers fear a
patchwork of state laws will disrupt national marketing
efforts. Large corporations can't afford to package goods
differently for a particular state, argues John Kamp, a vice
president of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies. They will "have to follow the strictest {state}
law" nationwide if they want to claim a product benefits the
environment.
   Few companies may choose such a course. Disparate state
laws mean "there won't be a whole lot of options left except
to refrain more and more from making environmental claims for
our products," says Donald Theissen, director of corporate
product responsibility at Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing.
He adds: "The consumer is the loser in the end."
   This fall, 3M started selling a recycled version of its
popular, removable Post-it Notes. But the new notes won't
qualify as "recycled" under the California law because they
are made from paper discarded during production rather than
paper used by consumers. And 3M can't find a reliable
producer whose recycled paper would pass muster.
   At the least, 3M "will have to refrain from selling
{Recycled Paper Post-it Notes} in California," Mr. Theissen
says. "The pressure is toward not making any {recycled-paper}
claims at all" in promoting the product throughout the U.S.
   Similarly, Lever Brothers wonders about its recyclability
claim for a new package design being tested in Seattle and
the Twin Cities. The "Bag in the Box" package, labeled "100%
recyclable," consists of plastic pouches filled with fabric
softener or liquid detergent inside a corrugated carton. The
Unilever unit won't be allowed to introduce the label in
California unless it knows the cartons can be "conveniently
recycled" in the state's 15 counties with over 300,000
residents apiece.
   "We would have to have something strictly geared for the
California market," says Melinda Sweet, Lever's director of
environmental affairs. "That's not something we are willing
to consider." Lever may refrain from rolling out the package
nationwide until national green guidelines emerge. "We don't
support state-by-state regulation," Ms. Sweet says. "It is an
impossible task."
   State officials say the laws protect consumers against
what they dub "green-collar fraud": misleading and deceptive
environmental advertising.
   American Enviro Products reached a settlement with the
task force of attorneys general in mid-October by agreeing to
stop making biodegradability claims about its disposable
diapers. The concern, which didn't admit any wrongdoing, had
promoted its Bunnies products as "biodegradable" in its
packaging and ads. The attorneys general contended the
diapers couldn't degrade quickly in landfills.
   Seven states sued Mobil Chemical Co. last summer charging
that Mobil exploited popular misconceptions by making
environmental claims for Hefty trash bags that it knew were
false. And the Federal Trade Commission expects to take
action soon against other manufacturers as a result of the
agency's 20 investigations into possibly deceptive claims for
"environmentally friendly" products.
   Too many companies "thought they could just stick that
{green} label on like candy," says Sarah Johnston, an
environmental policy assistant for New York's attorney
general.
   Kip Lepper, chief of staff for California Democratic
Assemblyman Byron Sher, the statute's sponsor, shares her
view. "The intent of this law is not to discourage
environmental advertising," he says, "but rather to bring
some truth to environmental advertising -- something which
has been woefully absent."

   WPP Skips Dividend
                                                                                                       

   WPP Group, in the latest sign of slowing revenue and
weakening cash flow at the British ad firm, said it won't pay
an interim dividend to shareholders.
   In a letter to shareholders, WPP Chairman David Ogilvy
wrote that it remains WPP's priority to conserve cash. "We
consider that it would not be in the best interests of the
company to pay the interim dividend for 1990 and therefore
this dividend will not be paid." WPP, which owns the J.
Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad networks, had said in
August it would pay 13.7 pence (25.9 cents) as an interim
dividend. Shares of WPP fell 11 pence to 50 pence Friday on
the London Stock Exchange.
   WPP was downbeat about 1991 earnings, saying it could be
"some time before the group can resume the pattern of growth
. . . experienced up until a few months ago." WPP added that
it is reviewing loan arrangements with its creditor banks to
reach satisfactory repayment terms, should earnings be weak
in 1991. The company declined to elaborate on the talks.

   Ad Notes. . . .
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Shearson Lehman Brothers awarded its ad
account to Chiat/Day/Mojo's New York office. The account is
expected to bill $20 million, somewhat more than in the past
year, a Shearson spokesman said. It covers ad
responsibilities for the brokerage company's domestic retail
business and asset management activities. Chiat already
handles the Gold Card account for American Express, which
owns Shearson. The win capped a good week at Chiat, which a
few days earlier won a big chunk of NutraSweet's national ad
business.
                                                                                                       

   ACQUISITION: Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner, Chicago, said it
acquired Peter Rogers Associates, a New York agency with
about $35 million in billings. Terms weren't disclosed. Peter
Rogers Associates, whose clients include Baccarat and Vidal
Sassoon, will operate independently.
