   TORONTO -- GW Utilities Ltd. said its board agreed to the
terms of a 125.7 million Canadian dollar (U.S.$108.5 million)
proposal by Toronto's Reichmann family to buy out the
company's minority shareholders.
   The offer was made by the Reichmann's closely held holding
company, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which already owns
89.3% of GW Utilities. Olympia &amp; York has offered C$30 a
share. GW Utilities shareholders also will receive a special
dividend of C$10 a share following the sale of the company's
82% stake in Consumers' Gas Ltd. to British Gas PLC.

   Separately, British Gas said it has completed the
acquisition of 99% of the shares of Consumers' Gas, a natural
gas distributor based in Toronto. The British Gas bid closed
Thursday.
   The buy-out of GW Utilities is subject to the approval of
the minority shareholders at a meeting scheduled for next
March.
   The buy-out also is conditioned on regulatory approval and
the completion of a proposed reorganization of Olympia &amp;
York's energy holdings. The company has proposed to spin off
Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. and Home Oil Co. as separate
public companies by the first quarter of 1991.
   Interprovincial and Home Oil are units of Calgary,
Alberta-based Interhome Energy Inc., which is, in turn, owned
40.7% by GW Utilities, 22.8% by Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.,
and 0.5% by Olympia &amp; York. Olympia &amp; York controls Gulf
Canada.
