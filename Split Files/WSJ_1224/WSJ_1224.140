   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election Commission dismissed a
complaint that a pro-Israel lobbying group illegally
coordinated political contributions.
   The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the
most powerful lobbying groups here, had been accused of
violating federal campaign-spending limits by secretly
coordinating activities of at least 27 pro-Israel political
action committees nationwide. A group of retired U.S.
diplomats led by former Undersecretary of State George Ball,
along with former Illinois Rep. Paul Findley, had filed a
complaint with the FEC in January 1989, charging the groups
were "affiliated" with AIPAC in a network that should be
regarded as a single political action committee.

   But the FEC, in a statement Friday, found unanimously
"there is insufficient evidence to indicate that AIPAC and
the respondent PACS are affiliated."
   The FEC said that the 27 PACS received data regarding
congressional races from AIPAC, and that their contributions
followed a similar pattern. But FEC concluded there was no
collusion between them and AIPAC. "It appears that each
respondent PAC makes independent decisions regarding which
candidates to support," the FEC said.
   In its filings to FEC, AIPAC said, "No one directs
American Jews to become active . . . in political campaigns,
or to give to candidates, or to form political organizations
of their own."
