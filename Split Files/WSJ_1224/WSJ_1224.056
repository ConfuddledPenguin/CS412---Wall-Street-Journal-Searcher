   International Business Machines Corp. will introduce its
long-awaited laptop computer in late February and appears
finally to have a credible product, industry executives said.
   The executives said IBM has produced one of the more fully
loaded computers in the so-called notebook class of laptops,
which typically weigh six or seven pounds. The machine also
carries an aggressive list price of $5,000 to $5,500, to help
IBM buy its way into the market, they said.

   "If they're going to deliver that kind of performance at
that price, it looks to me like it'll be a winner," said Matt
Fitzsimmons, a computer dealer in White Plains, N.Y. "It
doesn't seem there's too much room for a technology
breakthrough, but this could be a price breakthrough."
   However, the executives added that IBM, based in Armonk,
N.Y., still has a thing or two to prove to laptop customers,
having produced embarrassing failures with its two prior
laptop attempts in the past five years. The laptop market is
mutating as fast as any other part of the computer market,
and a new wave of much lighter machines is expected to appear
next fall. So IBM will have to work to convince corporate
customers that it can keep up.
   The industry executives said the laptop market is still
growing so fast that any share IBM wins won't come out of any
particular competitor's hide. In fact, machines such as IBM's
-- it has a fairly powerful 80386SX processor and large
hard-disk drives -- are just starting to arrive in the market
and are in hopelessly short supply. So any machines IBM can
ship in the first few months will just help the whole market
grow, the executives said.
   The IBM list price of $5,000 to $5,500 would be well below
the current list price of $7,000 for a comparable machine
from Compaq Computer Corp. Lesser-known AST Research Inc.
sells a machine with a smaller disk drive at a list price of
$3,400. Given the state of discounting among computer dealers
these days, all machines sell at about 30% off the list
price.
   While an IBM spokeswoman declined to comment, the industry
executives said the IBM machine will contain a 60-megabyte
hard drive -- enough capacity to store a bookshelf of
material. A megabyte is a unit of storage, equivalent to one
million characters or roughly 400 double-spaced, typewritten
pages. Compaq has begun shipping a machine with a 60-megabyte
drive, but few other companies go beyond 40-megabyte drives.
The IBM hard drive could be important, because laptop buyers
are gobbling up storage capacity.
   The executives also said IBM is talking up its keyboard,
which is full-sized and is slanted to make it more
comfortable to use, as most keyboards on desktop computers
are. But keyboards are an intangible issue, and using a
normal keyboard kept IBM's machine from being as small as
some competitors', such as Compaq's.
   The rest of the IBM machine's features are fairly
standard, the executives said. The machine weighs 7 to 7.5
pounds. The black-and-white screen has so-called VGA
graphics, the top of the line among laptops. The machine
comes with two megabytes of main memory, expandable to 18
megabytes, offering more expansion capability than in
competitors' machines.
   The machine is to be announced and available on Feb. 26,
though it may take IBM a few months to get its manufacturing
operations into top gear.
   While IBM is a bit late in announcing a laptop using a
386SX processor and is years late getting into the laptop
market, there should still be room for it to succeed. Not
only does the IBM logo ensure wide availability, but laptop
customers have always gone for the hottest machine of the
moment, rather than built up loyalties to a particular
company.
   "It's not too late to jump in," said Ed Anderson,
president USA of ComputerLand Corp., a big dealer chain.
   Success in laptops has become ever more important, as
these have captured a bigger and bigger chunk of the market.
Some market researchers have forecast that unit sales of
desktop personal computers will decline in the U.S. next
year. Yet laptop sales should continue to grow 40% to 50% a
year. Forrester Research Inc. forecasts that laptops will
account for at least one-third of U.S. personal computer
sales by 1993, so IBM can't afford to sit on the sidelines
any longer.
   Success also would let IBM resolve a public relations
headache. For years now, critics of IBM in the personal
computer industry would ask, in some form or other: If IBM is
so smart, why can't it build a decent workstation or laptop?
After years of failures, IBM introduced a strong line of
workstations in February. And it would love to be able to
answer the second part of that nagging question.
