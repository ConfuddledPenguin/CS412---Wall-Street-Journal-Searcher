   NEW YORK -- The federal funds rate is the Federal
Reserve's prime policy indicator, and the central bank had
allowed it to fall by about a percentage point since July.
Many analysts were expecting more decisive action to spur the
sagging economy when the Federal Open Market Committee, the
Fed's chief policy-making arm, met last week. In a sense they
got it, when the Reserve Board cut the discount rate to 6
1/2% from 7%. But the Fed probably still intends to proceed
very cautiously.
   The Open Market Committee still isn't convinced inflation
is dead, in spite of the relatively modest 0.3% rise in the
consumer price index for November.

   The committee members -- the seven Federal Reserve
governors and five of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents --
often disagree among themselves on the proper course for
policy. In the past two years, the inflation hawks have
seemed to hold the upper hand. Most committee members,
however, think now that inflation worry should be balanced
with more concern for the economy.
                                                                                                       

   It's a difficult balancing act, one that the Fed has not
always attempted. In the mid-1980s there was a sharp drop in
business activity; in the second quarter of 1986, the
inflation-adjusted gross national product actually declined.
The Federal Reserve responded by sharply stimulating the
economy.
                                                                                                       

   The federal funds rate that banks charge on overnight
loans to one another had been above 8% in early 1986 but by
late that year was below 6%. The Fed influences this rate by
buying or selling securities in the market; these
transactions increase or decrease reserves in the banking
system. By increasing banks' reserves, the Fed influences
them to lend or invest. Banks don't like to let reserves lie
idle, earning no interest.
   Reserves climbed sharply in 1986. By early 1987, however,
the Fed decided it might be overdoing the stimulus. The
consumer price index, which had been flat in early 1986, was
rising sharply. So the Fed began, very gradually, tightening
up.
   The stock market crash in October 1987 led the Federal
Reserve to ease policy for a few weeks but, by early 1988,
the gradual tightening took over again. It has persisted
recently.
   The decline in the funds rate since July, and other
interest rate decreases in recent weeks, are deceptive. They
reflect mainly a lack of demand for funds, not an aggressive
Fed easing of policy. Since early 1988, as the chart shows,
bank reserves have been essentially flat (see accompanying
chart -- WSJ Dec. 24, 1990).
   When the Fed recently eliminated the reserve requirements
on large certificates of deposit and Eurocurrency
liabilities, some analysts wrote that the Fed had given the
banking system $14 billion of reserves to back up increased
lending. Actually, the central bank scarcely had announced
the change before it went into the market to start pulling
out reserves; total reserves so far have stayed flat. At the
most, the effect of the reserve change won't be as drastic as
it might have been.
   For a few weeks in August and September the Fed had seemed
to realize that giving the banking system a modest addition
to reserves might be compatible both with containing
inflation and preventing a business collapse. In August and
September, bank reserves actually grew. In October, however,
reserves dropped at an annual rate of 20.2%, and the drop
continued in November.
   So what will the Federal Reserve do now? The Fed last week
decided to let its funds rate target fall to 7%, less of a
cut than some analysts had expected, but in line with the
central bank's gradualist approach.
   The cut in the discount rate, the fee the Fed charges on
its loans to banks, isn't likely to have much economic
effect. Banks are reluctant to use the discount window unless
they absolutely have to; discount borrowing is seen as a sign
a bank is in trouble. The central bank polices the discount
window very carefully, and banks are reluctant to use it
unless they have to.
                                                                                                       

   Still the rate is widely interpreted as a strong signal of
Federal Reserve intentions. The cut was quickly followed by a
drop in bond interest rates, but bond rates later moved up,
reflecting continuing inflation fear. The Fed, if it is to
spur business expansion, needs lower, not higher, long-term
rates.
                                                                                                       

   The Open Market Committee, as it met last week, had no way
of knowing how the Mideast crisis would play itself out. The
continuing upward pressure on energy prices keeps inflation
fears alive. Meanwhile, the crisis is boosting the budget
deficits, which by themselves used to cause inflation worry.
A peaceful resolution of the crisis, of course, would give
the Fed room to be slightly more stimulative.
   Indications are, however, that the committee recognized
that controlling inflation didn't require the Fed to deny the
banks any increase in reserves at all. So, gradually, the
Federal Reserve is likely to be moving in the direction of
ease. Change won't be dramatic, but the next moves in
interest rates are likely to be downward.
