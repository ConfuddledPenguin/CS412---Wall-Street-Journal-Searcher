   Steel makers Groupe Cockerill Sambre of Belgium and Groupe
Arbed of Luxembourg have broken off talks started earlier
this year to combine their flat-steel activities, Arbed said.
   Arbed said that "studies conducted during the past few
months have shown that the constraints of the two groups
aren't reconcilable on certain essential points."

   Further details weren't provided in the statement.
   The two steel groups announced last August they were
discussing a 50-50 joint venture to combine their production
and sales of flat steel. However, in November, executives at
Arbed's Belgian unit, Sidmar SA, said the talks had become
blocked over the question of control of the new joint
venture.
