   NEW YORK -- American Savings Bank said William G. Lillis,
president and chief executive officer, will retire at the end
of October 1991. A committee was named to begin a search for
a successor.
   Mr. Lillis, who has been president for 10 years, is
stepping down as a "back-to-basics" strategy that American
Savings recently initiated goes into effect. Following a
second-quarter $40 million loss posted last July, reflecting
an increase in reserves against possible loan losses, the
bank said it would consolidate its Riverhead Savings
operations and pursue the sale of other subsidiaries to cut
costs and pare assets.
