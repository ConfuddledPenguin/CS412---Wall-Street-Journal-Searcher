   Fokus Bank AS, Norway's No. 3 bank, received an equity
injection of 1.5 billion Norwegian kroner (US$253 million)
from a national bank guarantee fund to shore up a capital
base eroded by soaring loan losses.
   The financial bail-out of Fokus Bank came only a day after
Norway's second biggest bank, Christiania Bank &amp; Kreditkasse,
disclosed that it now expects loan losses this year to more
than double and to plunge the bank to an operating loss of
nearly one billion kroner. Banking analysts said the loan
losses underlined continued weakness in the Norwegian
economy.

   Fokus Bank blamed depressed real estate markets and a
collapse of the regional fish farming industry for a sharp
jump in nonperforming credits in its loan portfolio. The bank
expects to increase provisions against possible bad loans in
this year's accounts to 980 million kroner, more than wiping
out a 360 million kroner operating profit and leaving it with
a full-year operating loss of 600 million kroner.
   The guarantee fund's injection of guaranteed but not
paid-in equity capital will qualify as core capital and raise
the bank's capital ratio to 8.5%.
