   When Massachusetts Investors Trust, the first mutual fund,
started taking in money in 1924, there was no minimum
investment.
   Those were the good old days. Today, investment minimums
of $1 million and up aren't unknown, which means some
top-performing mutual funds are far beyond the reach of the
small investor. But for the wily piker, there are sometimes
ways to get around the published minimum.

   Take the five Pacific Investment Management Institutional
Trust bond mutual funds. Run by William Gross, the Pimit
funds are among the industry's top performers, and Mr. Gross
is among the nation's most respected bond fund managers. "If
you want conservative bond management, he's the best we've
found," says San Francisco fund analyst Kurt Brouwer.
   His clients are largely big institutions, and with good
reason. New investors have to fork over $500,000 to get into
the funds. But, as with other highflying funds that insist on
a steep initial investment, there are ways to sidestep
Pimit's high minimum.
   For investors who want to get into Pimit Total Return, for
instance, there are two alternatives. One way is to buy
Harbor Bond Fund, which is run by Mr. Gross and has the same
objectives as Pimit Total Return. But Harbor's minimum is
just $2,000.
   Harbor Bond is distributed by a subsidiary of
Owens-Illinois Inc., the Toledo, Ohio, maker of glass and
plastic containers. Harbor Bond, and the other five Harbor
funds, were set up by Owens-Illinois to manage its retirement
and deferred-compensation plan money. The company decided the
funds should also be offered to the public, and it launched
its first fund in 1986.
   When Owens-Illinois brought out a bond fund in late 1987,
Pacific Investment Management -- which had managed part of
the company's pension money since 1985 -- agreed to also
manage the bond fund.
   Over the past 12 months, Harbor Bond Fund has returned
10.76%, compared with 11.35% for Pimit Total Return. The 0.59
percentage-point difference in return is due almost entirely
to the difference in expenses at the two funds. Pimit Total
Return has total annual expenses of 0.6%, as against 1.21%
for Harbor Bond.
   Given that difference, those who want to invest with Mr.
Gross should take a close look at the second alternative,
which is to buy Pimit Total Return through San Francisco's
Charles Schwab &amp; Co., the discount brokerage firm.
   If you go through Schwab, you can buy a piece of Pimit
Total Return for as little as $1,000. While Harbor Bond Fund
is sold without a sales commission, Schwab charges a modest
transaction fee.
   But that fee could be worth paying if, say, you were going
to invest $4,000 and planned to hold on for more than two
years. For while Schwab would charge you $46, equal to 1.15%
of your initial investment, over time Pimit's lower annual
expenses would eventually compensate for Schwab's transaction
charge.
   Among the discount brokerage houses, the two biggest
offerors of mutual funds are Schwab and Jack White &amp; Co.
Though neither discount brokerage firm offers all mutual
funds, investors who deal through them can often open an
account for a smaller amount than if they went to a fund
directly.
   Here's why. With most funds, the minimum for subsequent
investments is generally lower than the amount needed to open
an account. At Gabelli Asset, for instance, a new shareholder
has to fork over $25,000 to invest with star fund manager
Mario Gabelli.
   But if an investor goes through San Diego's Jack White,
the minimum drops to zero. That's because Jack White already
has an omnibus account with Gabelli Asset, and the fund
doesn't enforce any minimum on subsequent investment. A new
shareholder going through Jack White is treated as a
subsequent investment.
   Even though Schwab and Jack White allow investors to get
into high-minimum funds for relatively paltry sums, their
services aren't cheap if you only have a tiny amount to
invest.
   On a $1,000 investment, Schwab would take $26 and Jack
White would charge its minimum fee of $33. But as the amount
rises, their fees are less as a percentage of the amount
invested. Jack White's minimum of $33 would still apply to a
$5,000 investment, while at Schwab you would pay $50.
   On a single investment, Jack White's fees are cheaper than
Schwab's if you have more than $1,875 to invest. But if you
switch out of one fund and into another, Schwab charges its
standard transaction fee plus $10, while Jack White charges
its standard fee plus an amount between $33 and $40. As a
result, for switchers of small amounts, it's almost always
cheaper to use Schwab.
   Many high-minimum funds lower the entry barrier when it
comes to individual retirement accounts. First Eagle Fund of
America, for instance, usually insists on a $25,000 initial
investment from new investors, but will lower the minimum to
$2,000 if you are opening an IRA.
   First Eagle has been managed as an offshore fund since
1967. In April 1987, a clone of the offshore fund was offered
to U.S. investors. Since then, First Eagle has returned
47.7%, compared with a total return of 28.7% for the S&amp;P 500.
The Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits the fund's
investment manager from publicizing the performance of First
Eagle's offshore fund, so a longer-term investment record
isn't available.

   Some funds have impressive returns, but also prohibitively
high investment minimums. Don't be put off: Sometimes you can
get in for less than the published minimum.
