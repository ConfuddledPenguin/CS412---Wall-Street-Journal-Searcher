   WARREN, N.J. -- Immunomedics Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson
agreed to terminate their research relationship, and
Immunomedics said it is negotiating to arrange financial
support for clinical trials of its monoclonal antibody-based
products.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., which had been
funding research in return for certain product rights, will
pay $2.7 million to Immunomedics for research under their
previous arrangements.

   Immunomedics makes antibody-based products for detecting
and treating cancer. Johnson &amp; Johnson, an investor in the
company in the early 1980s, sold most of its holdings in 1988
and has been cutting back on its research commitment with
Immunomedics.
   Russell McLauchlan, president of Immunomedics, said the
company is "now free to implement our strategic plan" to
become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.
   Mr. McLauchlan said the company is spending about $1.4
million a quarter, a figure it expects to continue over the
next two years.
   The company is conducting clinical trials of a colo-rectal
cancer imaging agent and expects to begin European and Asian
clinical trials for the product soon.
   Sales of products in its in-vitro diagnostic business rose
to $870,000 for the nine months ended March 31 from $330,000
a year earlier.
