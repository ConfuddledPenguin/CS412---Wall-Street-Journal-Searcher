   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said first-quarter
net income fell 40% to $8 million, or three cents a share,
from the year-earlier quarter when a big extraordinary gain
and other items skewed the bottling giant's results.
   The results matched estimates of many Wall Street analysts
who see slow but steady improvement at the company. Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., has had a
dismal earnings record in the 3 1/2 years since it was
created.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Coca-Cola Enterprises climbed 25 cents to $15.625.
   Operating profit climbed 19% to $65 million as operating
cash flow grew 11% to $123.6 million. The latest quarter's
results included a gain of $3.7 million on the sale of the
company's food service vending operations in Memphis, Tenn.,
while the year-ago period included a gain of $11 million from
the sale of Canadian bottling operations. In the 1989 period,
the company had net of $13.5 million, or seven cents a share.
   Volume growth, measured in case sales, was particularly
strong at 5%. Roy Burry, a senior vice president and beverage
analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said the figure is probably
twice the total market growth rate in the quarter. A
Coca-Cola spokesman attributed the increase to strong
promotions and a centralization of marketing functions at
company headquarters here.
   That growth, coupled with a moderate pricing increase of
2%, is a good sign that the bottler, which accounts for about
44% of U.S. sales of Coke products in bottles and cans, had
both engines running in the first quarter, beverage analysts
said.
   "The ability to maintain volume increases and pricing
increases at the same time is key," said George Thompson, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Research. "They are certainly
on the right track. People will want to see the second and
third quarters," which are historically the biggest for the
soft-drink industry.
   The company spokesman noted that "the seven cents a share
last year was entirely from things other than operations,
whereas this year at least two cents was from operations."
   Mr. Burry at Kidder Peabody, who had expected per-share
profit of three cents, without the one-cent gain from the
sale of operations, believes the company can still achieve
his earlier estimate of per-share profit of 45 cents in the
full year.
   The company said the 2% unit pricing increase was nearly
enough to offset the 2.5% increase in related cost of sales
for each unit -- a continuing sanguine sign for an industry
that was pummeled by price wars in the 1980s.
   "Things are gradually getting better," said Emanuel
Goldman, a beverage analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San
Francisco. "It's just a slow process."
   Revenue grew 5% to $906.4 million from $859.6 million. The
company capped the increase in selling, administrative and
general expenses at 2.2%.
   Several analysts remarked that the latest quarter's tax
rate of 51% was surprisingly high, a result largely of the
tax attributes of selling the vending operations.
