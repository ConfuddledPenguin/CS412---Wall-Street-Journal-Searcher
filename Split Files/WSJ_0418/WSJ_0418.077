   NEW YORK -- Banque Paribas and Wasserstein Perella Group
Inc. formed a $366 million fund to provide "mezzanine
financing" for friendly merchant-banking transactions and
European corporate restructurings.
   The fund, called European Mezzanine Fund, will be jointly
managed by Paribas and Wasserstein Perella; it is in the form
of European Currency Units, or ECUs, totaling 300 million.
Other participants are Commerzbank of West Germany and
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.

   Paribas and Wasserstein Perella said they anticipate a
second closing soon to accommodate additional investors.
Stephen A. Oxman, deputy chairman of Wasserstein Perella, an
investment bank based in New York, said it was possible the
additional investment could add between 50 million ECUs and
100 million ECUs to the fund.
   Banque Paribas is part of Paris-based Paribas Group, an
investment bank and financial services company with assets of
more than $140 billion.
   Mezzanine financing tends to occupy the same place in a
company's capital structure as junk bonds. It generally
consists of subordinated debt and associated equity
securities, such as warrants. Mr. Oxman said there were
several other such funds in Europe, all smaller than the
European Mezzanine Fund.
   He said the fund wouldn't focus on a particular industry
or country.
