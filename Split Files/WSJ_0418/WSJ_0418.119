   PITTSBURGH -- L.B. Foster Co., a maker and distributor of
construction, rail and tubular products, said Joseph H. Dugan
will resign as president and chief executive officer
following the annual meeting, scheduled for May 8.
   Mr. Dugan, who won't stand for re-election as a director
at the meeting, said L.B. Foster "is in a strong position in
its core business, and I can return to my consulting
practice."
