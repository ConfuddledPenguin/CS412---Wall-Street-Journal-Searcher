   BRASILIA, Brazil -- Prices in Brazil have declined since
President Fernando Collor de Mello launched his emergency
economic plan one month ago, Economic Minister Zelia Cardoso
de Mello said, and the government predicts prices will fall
further this month.
   Ms. Cardoso didn't provide a figure for the decline, but
said, "The deflation is being felt in practice by the
population" of 150 million.

   Mr. Collor announced his plan March 16, the day after he
took office as the country's first directly elected president
since 1960. He said his government's priority was to beat
record inflation that reached nearly 5,000% last year. The
heart of the plan was an 18-month freeze on bank savings
accounts valued at more than $1,200 and a limit on money
market withdrawals of $600, or 20% of an account, whichever
is greater.
   The measure took an estimated $115 billion out of
circulation and has the economy teetering toward recession.
   As part of the Collor package, prices and salaries are to
be "pre-fixed" on the 15th day of each month, based on the
government's expectation of future inflation. The minister
said that with the cost of living falling, prices and
salaries won't be readjusted this month. She said the plan
has already resulted in an increase in real wages of between
12% and 18%, as a result of a 73% raise being given workers
two weeks ago.
