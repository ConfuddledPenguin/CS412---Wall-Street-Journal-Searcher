   McDonald's Corp. said it will give preference to goods
made of recycled material when building, remodeling or
re-equipping its U.S. fast-food restaurants, a move that
could provide a big boost for plastics recycling.
   McDonald's already gives preference to a number of
recycled paper products, including napkins and drink
containers. Its new program -- dubbed "McRecycle USA" -- will
also give preference primarily to items that can be made in
whole or in part from recycled plastic. Among them:
construction lumber, ceiling and floor tile, restaurant seats
and table tops and playground equipment.

   "McDonald's is acting where other people are only talking.
They've put a lot of pressure on us for quick delivery," said
Michael Dahl, general manager of Eaglebrook Plastics Inc.,
the Chicago-based manufacturer of Durawood, a wood substitute
made of 100% recycled high-density polyethylene.
   The potential demand for recycled plastics "ought to make
communities more willing to include plastic in curbside
recycling programs," said Dennis Saborin, vice president of
plastics-recycler Wellman Inc., explaining that many
municipalities shy away from plastic because it's bulky.
Indeed, only about one million of the 10 million or so U.S.
households covered by a curbside program presently have the
option of recycling plastic, according to Resource Recycling,
a trade publication.
   Moreover, said Mr. Saborin, those towns that do include
plastic generally limit collections to soda bottles and milk
jugs, whereas the McDonald's program will encourage recycling
of all sorts of plastic containers and articles.
   McDonald's pledged to spend $100 million this year on
recycled construction supplies and equipment, compared with
$5 million to $6 million last year. But Shelby Yastrow,
senior vice president and director of environmental affairs
for McDonald's, said that to reach that goal, McDonald's may
first have to encourage development of a manufacturing base
for construction and remodeling goods that use recycled
material. "McDonald's is talking about having things made
that have not been made before," said Mr. Saborin.
   To spur manufacturer interest, Mr. Yastrow said McDonald's
will have a 24-hour 800-number that manufacturers can call
for specifications and other information. In addition, Mr.
Yastrow said McDonald's will fight to change local building
codes wherever such codes effectively prohibit using
construction materials that contain recycled material.
   Mr. Yastrow said McDonald's plans to open about 370
restaurants in the U.S. this year, while remodeling an
additional 1,000 outlets. Eventually, Mr. Yastrow added, the
new recycling program will be expanded to include McDonald's
units abroad.
   In an interview, Mr. Yastrow also said that McDonald's has
other environmental plans in the works. He denied that the
company's concern about the environment in any way springs
from efforts by several communities to ban McDonald's
polystyrene packaging because it won't decompose in
landfills.
   Mr. Yastrow indicated that future plans might include
having McDonald's spur the use of water-saving devices,
energy-efficient light bulbs, and even backyard compost
shredders. "If I can use the muscle of McDonald's, I will,"
he said.
