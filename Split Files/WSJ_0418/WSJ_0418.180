   AFTER READING about all the money other people are hauling
home in the Brink's truck, you may be suffering the first
tiny spasms of democratic rage. This is forgivable. It's a
galling thing to know that Lee Iacocca makes more during a
trip to the executive washroom than you do all day.
   So a lot of us are asking the obvious questions: What
makes these topsiders think they deserve so much? And what
about me? Am I chopped liver?

<TEXT>
   Alas, yes -- at least in the so-called free market, which
almost all of us devoutly believe in until we are caught up
in its actual operation.
   This much-worshiped mechanism gives a utility infielder
with a .212 average, a bad back and a good agent $1 million
guaranteed over two years, while a high-school math teacher
has to plan three months ahead to finance a valve job on his
1977 Datsun. It makes double-digit millionaires of people
with interesting hair who, after a labor of some years, have
mastered a few chords on the electric guitar. And it has made
your boss worth his weight in diamonds, even though everyone
suffering through his reign at Amalgamated Everything can see
that he is sending the outfit right down the old sanitary
facility.
   Is this right? Is this fair? God, no.
   The free-market value of top managers has been grossly
inflated by prattle about the rarity of their talents.
Academics, who have succeeded in making management studies as
incomprehensible as molecular physics, are wonderful at this.
PR types -- guess who pays their salaries -- aid and abet. So
does an uncritical press, whose members pride themselves on
aggressiveness but spend a lot of time slobbering at the
shoelaces of people who wear better clothes (almost
everybody) and make much, much more money than they do. The
result: a picture of business as some kind of complicated
primitive religion, its shamans the CEOs. Their secret runes
and rituals, things few can master, bring the rain and make
the cows heavy with calves.
   Smoke and wind. Executive ability is far, far more common
than the talent needed to spear a ground ball hit to the
hole. Anyone who has a fair amount of common sense, energy
and humanity can do a creditable or even exemplary job of
running a business. Parenthood is a lot harder. Look around:
There is no apparent shortage of decently run widget
factories, while that continuous low murmur you hear is the
sound of millions of people telling psychologists about their
crummy childhoods.
   But logic availeth not. As a nation, we remain convinced
that executive talent is as rare as Kirtland's warbler, and
therefore worth a ton of money; the past Decade of Greed,
with its adoration of business and big money, has hammered
this erroneous idea so deeply into the public mind that
dynamite couldn't dislodge it.
   This makes it difficult to sell pay-reform ideas like
inverted regressive compensation, which a few of us recently
made up over a couple of brews. Its rationale: Why give the
moon to 60-year-olds who have already educated the kids, paid
off the mortgage and have a basement full of Montrachet?
   Instead, we raise the starting pay of hot-eyed young
M.B.A. recruits to perhaps a half-million -- let's be
generous -- thus giving more money to those who need it. Then
we cut their pay as they slither up the greasy pole year by
year. At the end their compensation is mostly power, which
they can use with minds unclouded by personal distractions
that plague CEOs now, like worrying about what to do with all
the doubloons piling up in the four-car garage. Given current
CEO pay, this idea probably wouldn't cost much and would
promote efficiency. Employers would be motivated to give a
quick hook to youthful mediocrities instead of letting them
clog up the hallways for the next 30 years, and the more able
youngsters would be induced to give their all.
   A sensible notion but, as noted, politically and
culturally a hard sell. We simply have been too conditioned
to the idea that any big-company chieftain worthy of his
title must be paid the equivalent of the Bolivian GNP. So
have the chieftains. On, then, to a more palatable
alternative, the B&amp;J Reverse Twist. At Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade
Inc., a Vermont ice-cream producer, the highest-paid employee
cannot make more than five times the salary of the
lowest-paid. In practice, this has limited the pay of Ben
Cohen, chairman and co-founder, to an amount so niggardly
that many less-altruistic CEOs at big outfits wouldn't bother
to pick it up off the sidewalk.
   But what if we flipped the formula, stipulating that the
lowest-paid employee of a company -- Walt Disney Co., say --
couldn't make less than one-fifth of whatever CEO Michael
Eisner makes? His ox wouldn't be gored, while every gofer and
cleaning lady at Disney Studios would be immediately raised
to a hair under $2 million a year. You can't beat that for
across-the-board palatability.
   But a few annoying bugs remain on the economic side. After
a lengthy study that drained the blood out of several small
foundations subsidizing it, researchers at the Harvard
Business School have determined that financing this formula
would require a boost in Disneyland admission prices to
$11,748 a ticket. Focus-group interviews, said the
researchers, indicate that quite a few people might not want
to pay that much to get in. The idea clearly needs a little
work. But perhaps we don't need to bother. Saving the best
for last, we now propose a reform measure that not only meets
but also exceeds every criterion.
   It is this: Pay the CEO the moon and stars if you like --
but if he doesn't do well in the ensuing year, make him give
it all back. Every penny actual and deferred, every stock
option, everything granted that year.
   Is this economically feasible? Currently, the main
difference between a good performance one year and stinking
out the joint the next is that in the first case the boss
gets obscene rewards and in the second only enormous ones. By
reducing the latter to zip, a lot of companies would save a
fortune. As for the CEO, he has amassed more than enough fat
to live on for a year.
   Is this politically and culturally feasible? Fiendishly
so. Working the Cabernet-and-squab circuit, CEOs themselves
are forever thumping the tubs for the risk-and-reward aspect
of free-market capitalism. All our plan would do is at last
balance their own great rewards with a truly matching risk,
which they can hardly object to without looking like
hypocrites.
   Case closed. Now -- which CEO wants to go first? Don't all
raise your hands at once.
