   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said base prices for its 1991
Mercury Tracer will range from $8,969 for the least expensive
model to $11,219 for its new LTS model.
   Ford also raised prices by an average of 2%, or $354, on
the 1991 Ford LTD Crown Victoria and an average of 1.9%, or
$353, on Mercury Grand Marquis cars. The price increases
apply to full-sized sedans and station-wagon models.

   Ford raised base prices on its Tracer station wagon by
1.5%, or $148, to $9,990. The base price of the 1991 two-door
Tracer is down $389, or 4.2%, from the price of the 1989
Tracer; the 1991 model, however, lacks four features that
were included as standard on the 1989 model.
   Ford said it eliminated power steering, window defrosters,
intermittent windshield wipers, and remote-controlled side
mirrors in order to make the model more affordable to
entry-level buyers. Consumers may purchase these features as
options; they would cost a total of roughly $548 if purchased
separately.
   Ford didn't produce any 1990 model-year Tracers. Last
fall, Ford closed the Hermosillo, Mexico, factory where it
assembles Tracers and didn't reopen it until January, after
preparations for building the 1991 models were completed. The
new Tracer LTS model is based on Mazda Motor Corp's. new 323
model.
   The Tracer price boost follows price increases averaging
nearly 7%, or $577, that Ford tagged last month on its 1990
base model Escorts, which also are engineered by Mazda. Last
month, Ford raised prices of selected options on all cars
except Escort and Festiva by an average of $29.
   Base prices for the 1991 Crown Victoria will range from
$16,984 for the S four-door sedan, to $19,024 for the Country
Squire LX Wagon. Grand Marquis base prices will range from
$18,138 for the GS four-door sedan, to $19,429 for the Colony
Park LS station wagon.
   Yesterday's price increases on the full-sized cars follow
boosts last fall that averaged 6% on the 1990 Crown Victoria
and 6.2% on the 1990 Grand Marquis models. The 1991 models go
on sale May 31.
