   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration took
steps to respond to a recent court decision barring the
agency from imposing civil fines of $50,000 or less on
airlines for safety violations without first going to court.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that the FAA
improperly adopted rules to establish the safety enforcement
program that was authorized by Congress as an experiment in
1987. The court said the agency failed to give public notice
of the rules or to allow a period for public comment.

   The FAA, in an effort to address the court's concerns,
yesterday reissued the rules as proposals and established a
30-day period for public comment.
   The agency also moved to blunt a major criticism of the
program, under which airlines are often cited for security
violations. The FAA said it intends to change one of the
rules that required a finding of a safety violation before
settlements could be negotiated. Under the new approach, a
finding of a violation won't necessarily be required.
   The program is due to expire April 30, but the FAA wants
Congress to make it permanent.
   For fines of more than $50,000, the FAA still must refer
the cases to a U.S. attorney.
