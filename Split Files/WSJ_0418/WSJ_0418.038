   BRUSSELS -- Output of crude steel by companies in 35
nations, including the U.S., Japan and West European
countries, fell 1.5% in March to 41.8 million metric tons
from 42.4 million tons a year earlier, the International Iron
and Steel Institute said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. The U.S.
led the decline in production, with output falling 4% to 7.8
million metric tons. This decline and a 5.9% drop in steel
production in 21 other countries offset a rise in European
Community nations and Japan; EC output rose 2.4% to 12.6
million metric tons, and Japanese production increased 2% to
9.2 million tons.
