   RICHMOND, Va. -- Had J. Stewart Bryan III foreclosed the
mortgage on his parents' home, he might have raised fewer
eyebrows here.
   Historic preservationists are determined to save an
antebellum farmhouse nine miles northeast of Richmond where
Robert E. Lee himself spent four days in 1864 plotting the
battle that saved the city from Union capture. Mr. Bryan
wants to have the house removed -- or else torn down.

   An old-line Virginian whose ancestors fought for the
South, Mr. Bryan is vice chairman of Media General Inc.,
whose Richmond Newspapers subsidiary is building a $200
million production plant that happens to stand just a stone's
throw from the old house, known as Lockwood. Media General
bought the property last year and announced its decision in
October in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, one of the two local
dailies it owns.
   "Richmond Newspapers and Media General are not, and cannot
be, in the business of restoring and maintaining historic
buildings," Mr. Bryan wrote preservationists last December.
"We have no use for it," he says in an interview, "and we're
not going to manufacture a use for it."
   The news has hit hard in this genteel and deeply
conservative city still in love -- some say obsessed -- with
its past. Few families have given more to preserve Richmond's
monuments than Mr. Bryan's. But few figures in Richmond are
more monumental then Gen. Lee.
   "This is a paradox," says Robert B. Giles, an investment
broker and passionate preservationist. "Just by being a
citizen in Richmond, Va., you enjoy the benefits of what the
Bryan family has done." But tearing down Lockwood, or even
relocating it, he says, "would be like throwing red paint on
a Van Gogh."
   Mr. Giles has mobilized a preservationist coalition that
includes old and dear friends of the family. They have signed
letters to the Bryans, made discreet appeals and even offered
to help pay the cost of restoring and maintaining the house.
   But Mr. Bryan, whose great-grandparents helped launch
Richmond's preservation efforts at the turn of the century,
has been unyielding. "The only thing we don't need is the
help of these people who call themselves a coalition," he
says. "We didn't ask for it, we don't need it and we don't
want it."
   The preservationists are equally steadfast. "A number of
people are standing by us on this matter, and they have
expressed their dedication to the cause," Mr. Giles says
somberly. "If there is a breach, they will be very
disappointed."
   The house is a two-story white clapboard structure that
has seen better days. Its windows are boarded with plywood.
Termites and beetles have infested floor joists in the
"summer kitchen," connected to the main house by a breezeway
that itself has been poured over with concrete. In the oldest
section, built around 1800, more termites are in the beams.
   "Here is a simple farmhouse hardly worth preserving as it
is, other than for the fact that Gen. Lee stayed there for
two or three or four nights when he was sick," says Mr.
Bryan. Says his father, D. Tennant Bryan, chairman of Media
General: "The house is really not the Taj Mahal."
   Still, Lockwood has been declared eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places. It is the only
surviving structure around Richmond that Gen. Lee used as a
field headquarters, Mr. Giles says.
   Nearly incapacitated from dysentery, Gen. Lee was brought
by carriage to Lockwood, then known as the Clarke house, in
late May 1864. His army of 50,000 dug in nearby. A week
later, in early June, the outnumbered Confederates blocked a
Union advance in the bloody Second Battle of Cold Harbor.
Some 7,000 Union soldiers and 1,500 Confederates fell in less
than half an hour. "It was," wrote a Union captain, "the
greatest and most inexcusable slaughter of the whole war."
But for the South it saved Richmond from capture until after
Appomattox.
   Media General has offered to give Lockwood away and help
pay the cost of moving it, so long as it is put to public
use. But to the preservationists, it is Lockwood's location
near a rail crossing used to resupply the Confederates, as
much as the structure itself, that makes it so important.
   "By moving it to another site," says Hugh Miller, director
of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, "you really
take it out of context."
   But by leaving it where it is, the Bryans say, Lockwood
will stand in the shadow of a 10-acre, automated printing
plant made of glass and steel. Nothing, they say, could be
more out of place next door than a historic farmhouse. "It's
going to be lost-- dwarfed," says James J. Rhodes, director
of special projects for Media General.
   Preservationists see nothing wrong with leaving the house
where it is. If restored, they say, it would make a fine
visitor or conference center. "We don't envision it being a
museum or a shrine," Mr. Giles says.
   People close to the Bryans are perplexed by Mr. Bryan's
attitude but are guarded in their criticism. "The Bryans have
always done exactly right by Richmond," says Mimi Rose, a
friend of the family. Indeed, Stewart Bryan's
great-grandmother, Isobel Lamont Stewart Bryan, known as
"Belle," was the second president of the Association for the
Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA), Virginia's most
prestigious preservation group. Belle Bryan, who idolized
Gen. Lee, used her family's wealth and influence to save the
White House of the Confederacy in downtown Richmond and turn
it into a Confederate museum.
   "Many true patriots will sooner or later grasp the idea
that it is their duty to help preserve Virginia and her
history," she wrote. "It is almost impossible," her husband,
John Bryan, confided, "to make a Northern man understand how
we Virginians feel about our state."
   So far, the controversy has been played out with
well-mannered Southern civility, but the battle line is
clearly drawn, says Mr. Giles. And Richmond's old-family
society is beginning to feel the strain. "I can not take a
public stand," says Mary Tyler Cheek, a prominent and
outspoken preservationist whose father, Douglas Southall
Freeman (a legendary newspaper editor for the Bryans), wrote
a definitive four-volume biography of Gen. Lee. "I have been
close to the people who run the newspaper for more than 30
years," says Mrs. Cheek. "This is something I can not get in
the middle of."
