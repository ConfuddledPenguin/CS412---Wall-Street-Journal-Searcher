   Getting ready to collect monthly checks from a company
retirement plan, a deferred annuity or a life-insurance
settlement?
   People typically accept without question the monthly
benefit an employer or insurance company offers. But they can
sometimes get a bigger check elsewhere without added risk.

   The secret lies in an insurance product called an
"immediate annuity." That's an insurance contract that pays a
fixed sum each month for life or some other period.
   At retirement, for instance, people may be able to beat
the monthly payment their employer promises by opting for a
lump-sum benefit, if one is available, and using the money to
buy an immediate annuity from an insurance company.
   "You check the employer's rates, and you compare that with
the commercial marketplace," says Glenn S. Daily, an
insurance-product analyst in New York.
   People who are ready to start collecting monthly payments
from deferred annuities, which are tax-advantaged retirement
savings plans, may do better by switching to an immediate
annuity at another insurer. The same goes for beneficiaries
of life-insurance policies who want monthly income instead of
a lump sum.
   "You have to make sure your own company is competitive,"
says James H. Hunt, an actuary and director of National
Insurance Consumer Organization, Alexandria, Va. "I think
there is a great opportunity for (insurers) paying sub-market
interest rates on money that is just left, without being
shopped around."
   Indeed, there are wide variations in the monthly payments
that different insurers provide for the same lump sum.
Consider, for instance, a 65-year-old man with $100,000 to
invest in an immediate annuity that would give him a check a
month for life. Monthly benefits ranged all the way from $781
to $1,080 -- a 38% spread -- in a February survey of 124
large insurers by A.M. Best Co., an insurance rating and
research company in Oldwick, N.J.
   A particular company may post attractive payouts one month
but not the next and may be competitive at some ages but
uncompetitive at others, insurance sellers say. They advise
that consumers should get annuity quotes right at the time
they are considering a purchase and specifically for their
own age and sex.
   At the same time, consumers must be sure to look beyond a
juicy payout to evaluate the financial strength of an
insurer. "If you are retiring, and you are going to be
looking for this life income, you don't want to be worrying
about the ability of the company to pay," says James Temple,
a marketing vice president at Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, Newark, N.J.
   The good news is that consumers don't have to take a lousy
payout to go with a solid and established company. Some of
the most highly regarded companies often show up among the
insurers paying very high, although rarely the absolute top,
immediate annuity rates.
   Buyers who want to be superconservative might require the
insurer to pass three tests, suggests Mr. Daily: This year
should be at least the 10th in a row in which the company has
had a top A+ rating from A.M. Best. The insurer should also
have a top rating from at least one of the other three rating
agencies -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Duff &amp; Phelps. And the insurer shouldn't
have anything below a top rating from any of those three.
   Using the A.M. Best survey of rates as of February, a
65-year-old man could have gotten more than $930 a month for
life from two insurers passing those tests -- $939 from Sun
Life Assurance Co. of Canada, Toronto, and $934 from
Nationwide Life Insurance Co., Columbus, Ohio. Prudential,
which also passes those tests, was offering $906, according
to the Best survey.
   Some insurers offer bigger immediate-annuity payouts for
people who want monthly income from a deferred annuity or a
life-insurance policy at that same company.
   For instance, the lowest payer in the Best survey was
Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. of Newark, which said its
normal payout on a $100,000 immediate annuity for a
65-year-old man would be $781 a month. But the company said
it would pay $830 a month if the man were converting an
existing Mutual Benefit deferred annuity or was buying the
immediate annuity with the death benefit from a Mutual
Benefit life-insurance policy.
   Even at the higher level, however, Mutual Benefit's
monthly payment was below the median of the 124 companies in
the A.M. Best survey.
   The range in annuity quotes often reflects companies'
varying appetites for the immediate-annuity business. The
immediate annuity "is not a key product for us," says a
spokeswoman for Mutual Benefit Life. "It's something we offer
as part of our portfolio, but it's not aggressively sold,"
she said.
   Other companies point to the particular assumptions they
use in setting prices, such as their estimates of how long
people are likely to live. Annuity payments are generally
lower the longer the buyer is likely to live.
   There are some other factors for potential buyers of
immediate annuities to consider. For instance, rejecting the
monthly benefit from a corporate plan could be a bad deal if
the employer has a history of increasing its payouts from
time to time to offset inflation. And some insurers require
annuity buyers to pay upfront policy fees or other charges,
while others don't.
   It's also critical to follow certain procedures in moving
money into an immediate annuity from another insurer's
deferred annuity or from a corporate plan.
   In switching from one insurer to another, a consumer can't
simply surrender one annuity and use the proceeds to buy
another. The right course, to avoid immediate taxation on the
accumulated gains, is to have the new insurer arrange a
tax-free exchange of the contracts.
   Money coming from a corporate plan is usually moved into
an individual retirement account that holds the immediate
annuity, again to avoid immediate taxation. The retiree must
be sure to get a so-called tax-qualified annuity. Money can
be moved through a direct transfer to the insurer or,
alternatively, by taking the lump sum and rolling it over to
the insurer within 60 days.

   YOUR MONEY MATTERS COLUMN of April 10 contained incorrect
figures for payments from some immediate annuities purchased
with a $100,000 investment. The figures in the article and
accompanying table were calculated by multiplying payouts on
a $10,000 investment by 10. That was incorrect because the
payouts from some companies were net amounts that had been
reduced by policy fees. Those fees would be the same, not 10
times higher, for policies bought with a $100,000 investment.
Insurance companies listed in the table were correctly ranked
on the basis of payments for a $10,000 investment.
