   A late-afternoon rally failed to pull over-the-counter
stocks out of a downdraft that began with inflation jitters
sparked by yesterday's monthly consumer price index report.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed 1.28 lower, or about
0.3%, at 435.42, an improvement from a 2.72-point drop after
the first hour of trading. Declining issues outpaced
advancers, 1,039 to 855, and volume rose to 136.4 million
shares from 124.7 million Monday.

   Traders at several brokerages were encouraged by the late
rally. "There was a nice comeback at the end of the day,"
said Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading for Kidder Peabody,
who attributed the late activity to retail and program
trading. "The market tried its best to come back in the
afternoon. I think it did well, given that the bond market
was down."
   James Volk, manager of equity trading for San
Francisco-based Sutro &amp; Co., also was encouraged by the OTC
market's strength in the face of the weak bond market and the
ongoing volatility of the Japanese market. "The market acts
amazingly well in face of the bond action," Mr. Volk said.
   The day's heaviest trading again was in shares of
companies making news, noted Bob Antolini, head of OTC
trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Mr. Antolini said
that institutional activity was particularly brisk in
Intergraph, which fell 2 1/4 to 17 on more than eight times
average volume after reporting earnings late Monday.
   Investors bailed out of Northeast Bancorp, which was bid
up sharply late last week on revived hopes that Bank of New
York would complete its longstanding merger agreement with
the Connecticut Bank. Northeast's shares dropped 22%, losing
8 7/8 to 31 5/8 after this newspaper reported yesterday that
the transaction may be in question because Bank of New York
places a much lower valuation on Northeast than Northeast
itself does.
   The most active stock was a new issue, Pool Energy
Services closed at 10 3/4, up from its initial public
offering price of $10.25. More than 4.6 million shares of the
10.5 million share offering changed hands. Shearson Lehman
Hutton led the underwriting of the oil-field services
company.
   Interest rates rose to the highest level in 11 months in
the bond market yesterday, and the OTC market's list of big
losers was crowded with bank and thrift stocks. Peoples
Savings Bank of Brockton lost more than 25%, down 1 1/4 to 3
5/8; Olympic Savings Bank fell nearly 20%, off 3/4 to 3.
   Crestmont Federal Savings &amp; Loan slid more than 22%, down
7/8 to 3 1/8, a new 52-week low. Volume included one block
that represented slightly more than 1% of the S&amp;L's total
outstanding shares. Late yesterday, Crestmont said the office
of the Comptroller of the Currency denied an application by a
third party to acquire Crestmont's Netcong, N.J., branch
office.
   Earnings continued to drive many stocks. Microsoft, which
was one of the most-active issues, closed up 1 1/4 at 62 on
1.5 million shares just prior to the software company's
earnings release after the market closed. Microsoft earned 62
cents in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, up from 36
cents a year earlier. The per-share figures reflect a
two-for-one stock split paid Friday.
   Applied Biosystems dropped 1 1/4 to 13 1/2 on more than
double average volume after announcing that earnings for
third quarter ended March 30 will be 16 cents a share or
less. That's less than half the year-earlier net income of 39
cents a share and flat with second-quarter earnings. The
Foster, Calif.-based maker of biotechnology instruments said
orders and revenue for the quarter were below expectations.
   Biotechnology analyst Kurt Kruger of Hambrecht &amp; Quist
said that he thinks Applied Biosystems not only has saturated
the biotechnology market with its instruments, but also is
facing increased domestic and overseas competition. With few
new biotech labs emerging, the company is facing little
near-term growth unless it develops a "revolutionary change"
in equipment, Mr. Kruger said.
   Mr. Kruger, who yesterday advised clients yesterday to
"avoid" the company's shares, says he thinks it could be
another year before Applied Biosystems resumes 10% to 15%
growth in revenue.
   Artel Communications plunged 2 1/8 to 5 3/4 on more than
15 times average volume after reporting first-quarter net
income of one cent a share, including $15,000 in tax-loss
carry-forwards. That compared with 15 cents in the
year-earlier quarter, which included a one-time gain from a
technology license fee.
   Canonie Environmental Services slid early in the day after
announcing late Monday that it expects to report of loss of
about 10 to 12 cents a share for the fourth quarter ended
Feb. 28, compared with net income of 13 cents a share in the
year-earlier period. Shares of the Porter, Ind.,
hazardous-waste management concern closed off 1 3/4 at 11 on
more than three times average volume.
   Live Entertainment gained 1 1/2 to 21 1/2 after analysts
with PaineWebber and S.G. Warburg recommended purchase of the
videocassette distributor, citing the success of the film
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Live Entertainment owns the
North American videocassette distribution rights to the film,
the analysts said.
