   The government appears to be making hay out of its
previously reported probe of troubled Amcor Capital Corp.,
once one of the nation's largest syndicators of agricultural
tax shelters.
   According to company memos and investor newsletters, the
Internal Revenue Service recently proposed disallowing an
estimated $145.9 million in deductions that investors in
Amcor partnerships took during 1986. Investors are bracing
for more such notices for other years, and the disallowances
could eventually run into the hundreds of millions of
dollars.

   And last week, two men who did significant farming for
Amcor were indicted on charges of running an illegal
farm-based tax shelter of their own. The indictments, by a
federal grand jury in Sacramento, Calif., don't implicate
Amcor directly, but some observers consider them an ominous
sign. For one thing, coincident with the indictments, Amcor's
formerly longtime chief outside accountant agreed to plead
guilty to a felony tax charge and cooperate with the
government's probe of the two men, according to court
documents.
   "This is a key event," said Theodore Heap, a Portland,
Ore., attorney who successfully sued Amcor officials a few
years ago and currently represents an unhappy Amcor investor.
   While other syndicators focused on oil or real estate,
Amcor made a name for itself in the 1980s as arguably the
nation's leading booster of agricultural limited
partnerships, sinking investor money into Texas wheat,
California table grapes and the like. While they lasted, such
ventures were a big hit with wealthy investors, structured to
give tax deductions that were two to three times the amount
of investors' cash.
   Amcor made a name for itself again last year when it was
identified in federal court papers as the target of an IRS
criminal investigation into whether all its crops were ever
actually grown -- or grown for the benefit of Amcor
investors. While no charges have been filed against the
company, one IRS investigator asserted in a court affidavit
last March that Amcor had created an elaborate paper charade
that resulted in fraudulent tax deductions ranging up to $1
billion, allegedly constituting one of the largest tax scams
ever.
   The disclosure of the probe has hastened an unraveling of
the company's operations, which already had been upset by a
crackdown on tax shelters in the 1986 tax-reform act.
Officials of Amcor, currently based in Coachella, Calif.,
have strongly denied liability and blame its farmers for any
crops that weren't grown. Some of the company's Texas farmers
have been cooperating with the government criminal
investigation in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
   The $145.9 million in disputed deductions for 1986, which
could be swollen by interest and penalties, indicate that the
government isn't satisfied with merely a criminal
investigation relating to Amcor -- it's pressing civil
actions to get the money from investors. Last summer, the IRS
created confusion about its plans for Amcor investors by
distributing -- and later rescinding without explanation --
notices to disallow deductions for certain other Amcor
partnerships.
   "If there was previously any doubt as to the IRS intention
to proceed civilly against the limited partners, it has now
been dissipated," according to a March 26 newsletter of the
Amcor Limited Partners IRS Audit Committee, a newly formed
group of Amcor investors. "We expect more (notices) to be
received shortly." The committee has built a $1 million
warchest to battle the IRS and hired Stuart E. Seigel, former
chief counsel of the IRS, to lead the fight.
   Mr. Seigel, based in New York, said the notices "will be
contested one way or another and will be contested
vigorously," but declined comment on the substance of the
case.
   Meanwhile, Ronald L. Dodson and Raymond S. McCoy, farmers
and promoters whose business relationships with Amcor
officials date to the 1970s, were indicted, according to Mr.
Heap, the Portland attorney.
   According to IRS court affidavits, for instance, a company
known as C.H.M. de Mexico, formed by Messrs. Dodson and
McCoy, did farming work for some 10 Amcor partnerships,
generating more than $50 million in what one IRS investigator
asserted were "fraudulent" tax deductions.
   The indictments, however, pertain to other Mexican farming
operations that were not linked with Amcor. Each man was
charged with nine felony counts of tax fraud, carrying
aggregate maximum penalties of 27 years' imprisonment and a
$900,000 fine for each man. The indictment charges the men
with overstating depreciation deductions and other farm
expenses.
   In addition, Barry Jones, identified in court papers as an
accountant for the Dodson-McCoy partnerships, agreed to plead
guilty to one charge of "aiding and assisting in the
preparation and presentation of a false and fraudulent
income-tax return." He also agreed to cooperate with
authorities in the Dodson-McCoy probe in return for a
recommendation that he serve no jail time for his guilty
plea. According to Mr. Heap, Mr. Jones had been Amcor's chief
outside accountant since 1981.
   Amcor officials and lawyers for Messrs. Dodson, McCoy and
Jones couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.
