   Thomson-CSF S.A. said its consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests eased 13% to 2.63 billion
francs ($467 million) in 1989 from 2.97 billion francs a year
earlier.
   The French state-controlled defense and electronics group
said that the widely expected drop reflected weakness at its
Altus Finance unit, formerly Thomson-CSF Finance. This unit,
traditionally one of the group's strong points, saw its net
profit fall to 1.21 billion francs in 1989 from 1.76 billion
a year earlier. The group didn't elaborate on the reasons for
the weaker financial results.

   Thomson-CSF noted, however, that lower profit from
financial activities was offset to a large extent by its
major industrial units.
