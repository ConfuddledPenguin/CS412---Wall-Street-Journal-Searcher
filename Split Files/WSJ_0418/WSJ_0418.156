   Honeywell Inc.'s board asked the company to develop plans
to spin off its billion-dollar Defense and Marine Systems
business, saying the move seems to "offer the best value for
shareholders."
   Separately, Honeywell reported a 43% increase in
first-quarter earnings to $90.1 million, or $2.29 a share, up
from $62.9 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. Sales
gained 6.6% to $1.53 billion from $1.43 billion. The
Minneapolis-based controls maker cited continuing strong
market conditions in its industrial systems and commercial
flight systems business for the strong results.

   A spinoff of the Defense and Marine line could be approved
by the third quarter, the company said. In July, Honeywell
said it was reducing its dependence on weapons sales and that
it planned to shed its Defense and Marine Systems line.
