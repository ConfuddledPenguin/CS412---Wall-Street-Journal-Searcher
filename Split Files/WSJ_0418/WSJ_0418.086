   MOSCOW -- The fragile unity of the Soviet Communist Party
is rapidly coming apart as radicals and conservatives turn
their long-standing rivalry into an all-out struggle for
power.
   The battle is being fought on two fronts. Within the party
itself, conservatives appear to have gained the upper hand
and are openly demanding a purge of the membership. But
following recent local government elections, radicals have
taken control of city halls in Moscow, Leningrad and
elsewhere, and are promising to make use of their new power
base to push through sweeping change. Party authorities in
these cities, long the sole and undisputed rulers, are
mounting a rear-guard action to block them.

   President Mikhail Gorbachev has frequently said he wants
to hold the party together, at least until a key Communist
Congress in early July. For much of his five years in office,
he has successfully played off one side against the other,
all the while strengthening his own power.
   But as the gap grows wider and ever harder to straddle,
the question increasingly is: Whose side is Mr. Gorbachev
really on?
   The answer is far from clear. Under Mr. Gorbachev's
leadership, the Central Committee last week published a
letter sharply attacking the so-called Democratic Platform, a
loose coalition of radicals committed to transforming the
Communist Party into something akin to a Western-style
social-democratic group. The letter blasted the Democratic
Platform's "ideological vacillation and unscrupulousness" and
asked: "How can such people remain party members?"
   At the same time, Mr. Gorbachev is embracing many of the
radicals' proposals, including the establishment of a
multiparty democracy and transition to a market economy. In
his new post as the U.S.S.R.'s elected president, he has
distanced himself from the party's Politburo and other ruling
bodies, preferring to rely on his hand-picked presidential
council of advisers. Last week's decision to step up action
against Lithuania, for example, was taken by the council of
advisers, and not the Politburo.
   Lacking an unambiguous signal from the top, the bickering
between various factions in the party has grown fiercer. Many
believe a formal split isn't far off.
   "I hoped it would come after the party congress, but
following the {Central Committee} letter, I think it will now
take place beforehand," says Maxim Sotnikov, a radical who
heads Moscow University's Young Communist League. In the
event of a split, Mr. Gorbachev "already has a way out," he
says. "He's president."
   Leaders of the Democratic Platform group have so far been
reluctant to leave the Communist Party en masse and set up an
alternative, even though a handful of their supporters have
been expelled in recent days by local party organizations.
Both publicly and privately, the group's leaders are fudging
their next move. Many of them, including Kremlin maverick
Boris Yeltsin, are still hoping to play a role in revamping
the party at the July Congress.
   While they dither, their colleagues elected to city
government have taken up the running. In Moscow, Leningrad
and several cities in the Ukraine, radicals won a clear
majority during the local elections in March and have started
to form governing bodies.
   It is rarely straightforward.
   In both Moscow and Leningrad, the local Communist Party
has taken control of the newspapers it originally shared with
the governing councils and is claiming exclusive use of
dozens of buildings. "They were paid for out of party funds,"
said Moscow's Communist leader, Yuri Prokofiev, explaining
why the party is insisting on its ownership of more than 30
buildings in the Soviet capital.
   In the Western Ukraine, where nationalists won a landslide
victory in the elections, stern warnings seem to be the only
remaining weapon for conservatives. The Ukrainian Communist
Party yesterday slammed the newly elected deputies, many of
whom aren't Communists, accusing them of seeking to "further
their own ambitions." It warned that "resolute measures will
be taken to strictly implement" Soviet law, but didn't
elaborate.
   The battle is fiercest in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital,
where radicals failed to win a clear majority of seats.
Kiev's governing council has been deadlocked for days over
whom to elect as chairman. The local Communist Party leader
is standing for the post, so far without success. But
radicals also lack a handful of votes to push through their
candidates, according to Yuri Shcherbak, a Ukrainian activist
who is a deputy in the Soviet parliament.
   The struggle in Kiev and elsewhere is fierce because "the
party apparat have understood that if they lose, they'll be
without a future," Mr. Shcherbak says.
   Judging by the opening sessions of the Moscow city
council, Soviet politics is entering an extremely turbulent
period. Radicals in the Soviet capital are seeking to have
Gavriil Popov, a leading economist who edits a high-minded
economics journal, elected as mayor. But after two days of
fierce discussions on procedural and other issues, the
council has yet to get beyond preliminary items on the
agenda. They include whether to stop serving sturgeon at the
canteen and whether to remove the huge white bust of Lenin
standing behind the podium. (Neither issue has so far been
conclusively decided.)
   Meanwhile, Mr. Popov, a soft-spoken man with gray hair and
a broad smile, is under fierce attack by the Soviet
conservative press. Two papers, Literaturnaya Rossiya and
Sovietskaya Rossiya, both ran long profiles last week
portraying him an elitist hypocrite and opportunist. Mr.
Popov shrugs off the attacks as reminiscent of old-style
Soviet journalism.
   Arguments erupt at every step. When the radicals approved
a mild declaration on Monday supporting two public
prosecutors who have investigated high-level corruption and
who are currently under government investigation for abuse of
power, conservative Communist deputies in the council walked
out. Some of them walked out again yesterday when the session
sanctioned a rally by the Kremlin walls in support of the
prosecutors, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov.
   The council's conservative executive committee, which
serves as a caretaker administration until a new committee is
elected, suggested holding the rally next week in a Moscow
park, but was overruled. In the end, several thousand people
gathered for the lunchtime demonstration, timed to coincide
with a debate on the two prosecutors in the national
parliament. The crowd, clearly siding with the radicals,
shouted and waved slogans such as "Shame on the Central
Committee" and "Party Mafia-Resign."
   "This is a simple struggle between reactionaries and
democrats," one speaker told the crowd. "For 72 years we have
been governed by criminals."
