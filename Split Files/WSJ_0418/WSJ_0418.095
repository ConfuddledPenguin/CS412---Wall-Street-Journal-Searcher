   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. shifted several
executives in its stock-trading operations in the big
securities firm's continuing effort to boost profits.
   The American Express Co. unit, which today is expected to
announce a record first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917
million, set up a new world-wide equity division and
appointed two executives to run it. They are Peter Da Puzzo
and Jack Rivkin, both 49 years old, who will be responsible
for all research, sales and trading.

   At the same time, Louis B. Lloyd, 47, who had been head of
institutional sales and trading, is being assigned to a new
post. Shearson said Mr. Lloyd will "work on developing
proprietary-trading products" with Richard S. Fuld Jr., 43,
the head of capital markets who announced all the changes.
Mr. Lloyd's new job isn't considered a promotion.
   The shifts provide big increases in power for Messrs. Da
Puzzo and Rivkin, whose stars have risen at Shearson while a
host of others' have fallen recently.
   American Express has been shaking up Shearson management
-- starting with the ouster of former Chairman Peter A. Cohen
in January -- as it restructures and shrinks the firm. Much
of the first-quarter earnings loss expected to be announced
today is the result of one-time charges to pay for that
restructuring effort. But Shearson has also been losing money
in its traditional businesses of stock trading and investment
banking; it will sustain about $110 million to $130 million
in operating losses in its first-quarter results.
   Mr. Da Puzzo, since 1982, has led Shearson's huge and
successful over-the-counter trading department, for which he
retains responsibility. Mr. Rivkin was head of research since
1987; he will be succeeded by his deputy Fred Fraenkel, 40.
Mr. Fuld said Messrs. Da Puzzo and Rivkin are "two of our
most capable managers" who "have each built terrific
departments."
   With their new posts, Messrs. Da Puzzo and Rivkin will run
all of Shearson's stock operations in the U.S., Europe and
the Far East, which are second in size among U.S. brokerage
firms only to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Shearson is seeking "a much
more coordinated effort" among its global equity operations
with the new setup.
   More important, Shearson hopes to improve revenue and
profit. Both Shearson and Merrill have been pulling back from
some of the rapid global expansion they undertook in the
1980s, but firms of their size have had difficulty breaking
down internal feifdoms. "The objective is to bring it all
together in one unit," said Mr. Rivkin. "There will be one
profit-and-loss {statement}, as opposed to having individuals
running their separate areas."
