   Gannett Co., citing sharply reduced spending for newspaper
advertisements, posted flat first-quarter net income. The
Arlington, Va., media company's profit was $75 million, or 47
cents a share, compared with $74.9 million, also 47 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue eased less than 1% to $813.4 million from $817.6
million.

   The year-ago results included a pre-tax gain of $9
million, or three cents a share, on the sale of newspaper
operations.
   Gannett blamed its flat performance on a deteriorating
consumer economy and restructuring in the retail industry,
saying this produced "the poorest advertising environment in
almost 20 years." Gannett, the publisher of 83 daily
newspapers including USA Today, said ad revenue declined 3%,
reflecting a 6% decline in ad volume. Retail ad linage was
off at most of its newspapers and was "particularly soft" at
its eastern newspapers. USA Today's ad pages for the quarter
dropped to 851 from 896 a year earlier. But because of rate
increases, ad revenue rose 8%.
