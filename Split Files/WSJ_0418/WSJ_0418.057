   NEW YORK -- McGraw-Hill Inc. said first-quarter net income
fell 47%, although the publishing and business information
company forecast improvement "throughout the year."
   Net income fell to $16.5 million, or 34 cents a share,
from $31.2 million, or 64 cents a share; the year-earlier
figure includes a gain of $8 million, or 16 cents a share,
from a change in accounting for income taxes. Without the
gain, net would have fallen 29%. Revenue rose 7.6% to $420
million from $390.3 million.

   Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the results were in line with expectations of a soft
first quarter. He noted that the joint-venture school
publishing company with Macmillan Inc. has increased the
seasonality of the business; McGraw-Hill's share of the
venture's first-quarter loss was $12.8 million, "actually
less than anticipated. We expect fine results from the
joint-venture company for the full year."
   Borrowing for acquisitions increased interest expense to
$12.5 million from $4.7 million; the company's tax rate,
because of divestitures, was 43% in the latest period, up
from 30% a year ago.
   Mr. Dionne said the company expects to achieve its target
for 1990 earnings of $3.50 to $4 a share (which, based on
about 48.8 million average shares outstanding, would indicate
net income in a range of $170 million to $195 million).
   Operating profit for the largest unit, information and
publication services, fell 29% to $19 million from $26.7
million, reflecting continuing investments in the
construction information business, a shortage in certain
operations of the computer and communications business unit,
and decreased advertising at Business Week magazine.
   Broadcasting operating profit fell because of increased
programming costs and softness in some markets. Operating
profit from financial services rose 22% to $32.1 million from
$26.4 million.
