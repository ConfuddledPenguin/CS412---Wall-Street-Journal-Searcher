   Hong Kong share prices broke above a key level again
yesterday to reach their highest closing since the Chinese
crackdown on dissent last June.
   Strong overseas interest, following through on the
market's pre-Easter holiday rally, helped the blue-chip Hang
Seng Index gain 24.75 points to close at 3020.44, exceeding
its previous high for the year of 3014.02 recorded on March
26. The broader Hong Kong Index jumped 15.03 points to
1984.64.

   Turnover improved to 1.53 billion Hong Kong dollars ($196
million) from 1.31 billion Hong Kong dollars last Thursday,
when the market gained 35.71 points. Trading was closed
Friday through Monday.
   Properties shares posted the day's sharpest gains,
followed by commercial and industrial shares and utilities.
Banking issues were little changed.
   The market opened slightly higher and surged 33 points in
the first half-hour before profit-taking set in. The index
stabilized by midmorning and held within a narrow range over
the remainder of the session, finishing the day eight points
off the intraday high.
   Players said overseas institutions, which have begun to
show increased interest in the local bourse, placed buy
orders over the long Easter weekend, particularly after the
first anniversary of the death of ousted Chinese Communist
Party chief Hu Yaobang passed without incident. Mr. Hu's
death on April 15 sparked last year's pro-democracy movement
in China and there was speculation that new demonstrations
could break out on the date.
   Wall Street's overnight strength also helped the bourse's
initial surge, players added. But the lack of new positive
developments prevented the market from achieving further
gains.
   Percy Au-Young, research manager at DBS Securities Hong
Kong Ltd., noted that overseas buying was aimed exclusively
at selective blue-chip issues. While trading volume figures
for the day were strong, they include the effect of several
large share placements and thus present an exaggerated
indication of market enthusiasm.
   On the other hand, players pointed out that there was no
attempt to push the market lower on the back of the
profit-taking, indicating that sentiment remains reasonably
sanguine.
   Participants expect the market to fluctuate between 3000
and 3050 in the coming sessions in relatively quiet trading,
as players seek to consolidate recent gains without losing
momentum.
   Mr. Au-Young, however, warned that the market could drop
below 3000 in the absence of positive developments in the
next several days. The impact of such a move would likely be
limited, with the index enjoying firm support around 2950.
   Among property shares, Cheung Kong added 10 cents to 11.40
Hong Kong dollars ($1.46), Hang Lung Development edged up
five cents to 5.15, as did Hongkong Land to 7.85.
   Among leading banks, Bank of East Asia rose 10 cents to
13.70, Hang Seng Bank gained 20 cents to 20.40, while
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank lost five cents to 6.30.
   In the utilities sector, Hong Kong Telecom held steady at
5.45, China Light climbed 20 cents to 13.60 and Hongkong
Electric advanced 20 cents to 9.25.
   As for the major trading companies, Hutchison Whampoa
gained 20 cents to 10.40, Jardine Matheson jumped 40 cents to
29.30 and Swire Pacific's Class A shares added 30 cents to
16.30.
   In Tokyo, stocks finished little changed after the weak
yen sent investors to the sidelines in the afternoon and
strong morning advances eroded.
   The Nikkei index, which advanced 350 points by the end of
the morning session, ended the day down 1.58 points from
Monday's closing level, at 28461.60. Prices advanced strongly
in the morning session, as a wide range of issues were bought
following Monday's 750-point plunge.
   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 100
points to 28561.60.
   On Tuesday, large-capitalization stocks such as Hitachi
Ltd., Toshiba Corp. and the "big five" steel makers made
sharp gains during the morning. Prices of most of these
shares nosedived later in the afternoon, pulling the Nikkei
index down with them.
   London share prices closed marginally weaker in stagnant
dealings, as investors found little fresh news to incite
activity after the long holiday weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
down 7.6 points at 2214.5, a bit better than its midafternoon
minimum of 2213.8 and well below its opening peak of 2225.7.
   The narrower 30-share index was down 4.7 points at 1736.3.
Volume amounted to a skimpy 254 million shares, compared with
the 324.5 million traded Thursday, the last trading day
before the long weekend. Commentators said trading would
likely remain spiritless until a new direction could be
discerned.
   Shares were largely unchanged throughout most of the
session but then sagged at midafternoon in tandem with a weak
New York opening, brought on by a report that the U.S.
consumer price index rose more sharply than expected in
March.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in Paris,
Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, were lower in
Frankfurt, and closed mixed in Zurich.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, shares were higher in Seoul,
little changed in Sydney and Manila, mixed in Wellington and
weaker in Singapore and Taipei.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
