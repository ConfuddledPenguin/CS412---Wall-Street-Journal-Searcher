   TOKYO -- Four nights a week, Ken Moroi, a top-ranking
cement executive here, is whisked to a lavish restaurant,
where he dines with clients and business leaders. Once a week
or so, a chauffeur drives him to a luxurious private club to
play a round of golf with other executives.
   The dinners could cost the equivalent of, say, $535 a
person; the golf games, $670 for a foursome. And, of course,
Mr. Moroi's company picks up the tab -- an entertainment bill
that ran about $13,500 one recent month.

   "Limits on social expenses are vague," Mr. Moroi, chairman
of Chichibu Cement Co., says matter-of-factly. Lounging on a
long leather couch in his spacious office here, he adds:
"There almost aren't any."
   It certainly sounds like the good life. And in many ways
it is. But there's another side of the coin. The 62-year-old
Mr. Moroi, as head of a major Japanese cement company, is
paid only about $260,000 a year, well below what an American
would earn in a corporation with 1989 sales of about $416
million.
   The gap in salaries between Japanese and American
executives is as wide as the ocean that separates the two
countries. Although the disparity is obvious, comparisons are
difficult to make because Japan lacks disclosure requirements
and people here are generally unwilling to discuss pay.
   Towers Perrin, a U.S.-based benefits consulting firm,
estimates that the average top executive of a large Japanese
company receives between 40 million yen and 60 million yen a
year, the equivalent of about $270,000 to $400,000. That's
well below Towers Perrin's calculation of an average of $1.3
million in 1989 for chief executives of the top 100 companies
in the U.S. (For both countries, the figures are for base
salaries plus annual incentives. They don't include stock
options in the U.S.; such options remain an alien concept in
Japan.)
   Part of the reason for the gaping disparity is that
Japanese companies strongly emphasize a kind of equality in
pay, from top to bottom. This policy means that an
executive's salary, like the executive himself, isn't on a
fast track as he trudges through the ranks to the top. Thus,
his compensation stays more in line with the salaries of
lower-ranking executives and managers than is the case in the
U.S. If there were an acute gap, managers here say, it would
discourage the lower-ranking employees.
   Income disparities are narrower here not just between the
top and the bottom of the corporate ladder but also among
those executives bunched on the top rungs. That derives from
the importance the Japanese place on another kind of
equality. Japanese executives make more decisions by
consensus, and power and responsibility are less concentrated
than in the U.S.
   Another factor is the Japanese tendency to promote by age.
Even Honda Motor Co., which emphasizes that it takes
performance into consideration when determining an employee's
pay, concedes that age is still the basic deciding factor.
   "If you pay money" to reward workers for their jobs and
responsibilities, says Hiroshi Matsuzawa, a manager at SGS
Inc., a Swiss-based headhunting company, "the whole pay
system will collapse" because the concept of equality won't
function. When a 42-year-old manager jumped from his Japanese
financial company to a foreign financial institution, says
Mr. Matsuzawa, his annual salary of about $94,000 nearly
doubled.
   But the prospering manager who makes such a move won't be
able to run up those big wining-and-dining bills.
Foreign-owned companies, despite their higher salaries,
aren't nearly as generous with their expense accounts. Thus,
the peripatetic executive may have to dig into his own
pockets to pay much of the entertainment tab.
   Executive job-hopping, so common in the U.S., started just
recently here, remains relatively uncommon and so far is
confined to lower-level managers. In Japan, senior executives
tend to reach their positions only after some 20 years with
their companies.
   One other factor helps to explain the discrepancy in
executive pay between Japan and the U.S. Here the inflexible
system bases compensation more on the position a person holds
than on the person who holds it. Thus, companies shower the
people occupying their top spots with chauffeurs, golf-club
memberships and sumptuous entertainment fees. Not all
executives and managers are pleased with the Japanese system.
But many remain cautious about adopting the American way,
even if that might raise their salaries. Top executives would
be forced to concentrate on improving quarterly revenue, says
a manager for a Tokyo trading company, making it difficult to
decide on long-term policies. Besides, says the manager,
"there's an atmosphere here that doesn't allow wealth to
concentrate on one person."
   And the current Japanese system does have one advantage:
It's a way of getting around taxes. The executive doesn't
have to pay taxes on such perks here, where the maximum
marginal income-tax rate is 65%. That's double the comparable
33% in the U.S.
   Client entertaining, called "settai", can include anything
from dinners and golf games to mah-jongg sessions, trips to
hostess bars, and sumo matches.
   "You enjoy the tickling feeling of becoming an executive,"
says Kenji Yatomi, president of Tokyo's Wage and Salary
Management Consulting Institute, which takes annual surveys
of executive compensation. Companies willingly pamper
executives with allowances of $6,700 to more than $10,000 a
month, says Mr. Yatomi, a former Honda manager.
   Discussing business isn't the main point of the
entertaining, and guidelines are loose -- often encouraging
bosses to sneak a drink or two with their underlings, he
says. But companies believe that a fancy dinner with a geisha
show and perhaps a little souvenir may deepen ties with
clients and smooth the way toward successful deals. Too
little of that, on the other hand, could be deadly, they
think, for the company could be labeled as stingy.
   Corporate spending on entertainment nationwide totaled
4.55 trillion yen, the equivalent of more than $30 billion,
in the year ended in January 1989. And an array of pricey
businesses are sprouting. The lavish King Field Golf Club in
central Japan offers extravagantly priced business dinners
and receptions in its clubhouse. Players are accompanied by
caddies clad in purple jumpsuits. Cost: a one-time membership
fee of more than $1.3 million, plus a per-player charge of
more than $185 on weekends. This kind of outlay is almost
always paid by companies in Japan.
   "People seem to think you need a luxurious atmosphere,"
says a former automotive official, remembering a fancy
$470-a-person meal in a well-known Japanese restaurant. But,
the official says with a laugh, he found that a large part of
the bill paid for the plush surroundings and the
super-attentive waitresses. A main course of his meal
contained only about five thin strips of beef, which the
women grilled one by one in front of him.
   Companies also offer their executives other tax-free
perks, such as sports and lodging facilities scattered around
Japan and even in other countries like Australia. Company
housing is another big plum: Yamaichi Securities Co. last
year provided its president a plush new apartment in central
Tokyo, thus eliminating his hour-long commute.
   Although many businessmen say they would rather get the
perks, not all take them to be particularly gainful. Playing
mah-jongg with clients can be a somewhat stressful
obligation, says SGS's Mr. Matsuzawa; the hosts, for
instance, must make sure the clients win the game. Haruhiko
Katsumata, a young president of a company connected to the
pinball-parlor industry, confesses that to spare older
clients any embarrassment, he spends more time rolling his
guests' golf balls out of the rough than playing his own
game.
   Many think that the pay system and the importance of
entertainment will continue for some time to come. Still,
says Chichibu Cement's Mr. Moroi, if given the choice between
cash and perks, he might choose not to entertain.
   "If we're young and want to have fun, we might think of
these things as a plus," says the snowy-haired executive.
"But at times, I wish I could just relax on holidays."
