   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices jumped 0.5% last month, the
same as in February, pushing inflation for the first quarter
to an 8.5% annual rate, the Labor Department reported.
   Although that's the highest quarterly rate since the
spring of 1982, when the country was emerging from prolonged
double-digit inflation, few economists expect the pace to
continue. Much of the steep run-up early this year --
consumer prices rose 1.1% in January -- stemmed from the
bitterly cold December weather that ruined crops and taxed
fuel supplies, leading to higher prices for both food and
energy.

   The inflation rate for the 12 months ended in March
actually slipped a hair, to 5.2% from 5.3% for the 12 months
ended in February.
   Nevertheless, many analysts said the latest numbers
suggest inflation will continue to be a problem for some
time.
   "When you run down the various categories, the fact of the
matter is that in almost all of them, inflation is getting
worse, not better," said Norman Robertson, chief economist of
Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "That's disturbing in the overall
context of slow economic growth."
   Other government reports issued yesterday suggest that the
persistence of inflation is occurring despite continued
sluggishness in the economy.
   The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production
shot up 0.7% in March, but it said a weather-related increase
in utility output and a surge in car manufacturing, following
a campaign to trim inventories, accounted for much of the
gain. "Elsewhere production was little changed, on balance,
in March," the report said.
   Reflecting the higher output levels, American factories,
mines and utilities used 83.3% of their production capacity
in March, up from 82.9% in February, the Fed said.
   Analysts said utility output was actually no higher than
normal for March, but because February was unseasonably warm,
a return to regular energy usage with March temperatures
registered as a large increase.
   Also, economists said that while the pickup in auto
production is good news for the industry, it indicates only a
return to more normal levels of output after a severe
campaign to reduce inventories earlier this winter. Many
expect weak consumer demand for autos to continue leading to
soft production.
   "We know that auto sales have been treading water at
best," said Alan Gayle, economist at Crestar Financial Corp.
in Richmond, Va.
   Also during March, housing construction slowed sharply,
according to the Commerce Department. Work began on new homes
and apartments at an annual rate of 1,321,000 during the
month, a 9.3% drop from February, the department reported.
   But again, the weather was partly to blame. Many builders
started projects earlier than they had planned this winter
because temperatures were unseasonably warm in January and
February. As a result, March housing starts looked weak by
comparison.
   Permits for future construction were issued at an annual
rate of 1,206,000 units, down 7.6% from February.
   Mr. Gayle said the building industry should benefit from
the good weather in the long run.
   But for now, he said, the reports suggest "the economy is
still limping along."
   The economy has been sluggish for the past year, the
result of the Fed's efforts to stave off inflation by pushing
up interest rates. Aided in part by the unseasonably warm
weather at the beginning of the year, the economy has shown
signs of picking up a bit in the first quarter.
   But Katsuyoshi Tamura, chief economist at the Bank of
Tokyo New York Group, said after the latest round of economic
reports yesterday: "I think the economy is in so-called
stagflation -- slow economy, persistent inflation."
   Mr. Robertson added: "I think it's now painfully obvious
that a period of subpar economic growth isn't going to bring
about a reduction in the inflation rate. Inflation looks
very, very stubborn, very entrenched."
   The latest inflation report was particularly disappointing
because the government had reported only a few days ago that
prices at the wholesale level declined in March. The drop
stemmed largely from declines in energy and food prices.
   But at the retail level, food prices rose 0.4% in March,
on top of a 0.5% climb in February and a 1.8% surge in
January. Energy prices, however, did fall for the second
consecutive month. They declined 0.8% in March after dropping
0.7% in February and leaping 5.1% in January.
   Clothing prices were another big factor in the latest rise
in inflation. They jumped 1.6% after rocketing 3.3% in
February. Most economists believe those increases are far too
big to be sustained, and predict that clothing prices are
sure to fall in the coming months.
   Medical-care prices continued their relentless ascent.
They grew 0.8% in March, matching February's rise. Housing
prices increased 0.5% after rising 0.2% in February.
Entertainment prices rose 0.4% for the second month in a row.
   In another report, the Labor Department said the weekly
earnings of American workers grew 0.1% in March after
adjusting for inflation. In February, they increased 0.3%.
   Figures in all the reports are adjusted for seasonal
variations.
