   Philadelphia -- The timing certainly was fortuitous for
the opening of William Bolcom and Arnold Weinstein's new
musical, "Casino Paradise," presented by the American Music
Theater Festival here on Sunday. While fictional gangsters
overran a quiet seaside town with casino gambling on the
stage of the Plays and Players Theatre in Philadelphia,
Donald Trump was opening the Taj Mahal, his latest
contribution to that art, at the other end of Atlantic City
Expressway. But in this case, truth packed more punch than
fiction. Trump's slot machines broke down from overuse and
set off fireworks among would-be gamblers, but "Casino
Paradise," despite a host of terrific songs, was a fizzle.
   Mr. Bolcom, a classically trained composer with a gift for
the popular idiom, and his lyricist collaborator seemed like
an ideal pair to create a musical-theater antidote to all
those shows in which the sets, costumes and special effects
are more important than the music and the words. Their song
cycle, "Cabaret Songs," with its catchy, well-turned tunes
and sophisticated, wicked lyrics, is grateful to singers and
entertaining to audiences. Unfortunately, "Casino Paradise"
is rather like a full evening of "Cabaret Songs." It has all
that clever tunefulness and verbal agility, but little book
or character development.

   "Casino Paradise," set in an unspecified time and era, is
about a gangster-tycoon, J.J. Ferguson (Timothy Nolen), who
buys up a seaside town and brings in gambling, winning over
its inhabitants with blackmail and transparent promises that
as he gets richer, they will too. He is opposed by his
confused, quasi-countercultural son, Stanley (Eddie Korbich),
whose motives stem as much from hatred of his father as from
sympathy for the little guy, and adored by his greedy and
equally confused daughter, Cis (Janet Metz). An ensemble of
weak-willed townspeople/gamblers wavers between J.J. and
Stanley. J.J. gets Stanley sentenced to jail for crimes he
did not commit, so Stanley shoots Dad, and gets put away for
good.
   In Act II, Stanley wakes up from a yearlong coma, during
which he has been tended by a mysterious nurse (Joan Morris)
and undergone a change of heart. Stanley escapes from jail to
fall in love (sort of) with a transvestite prostitute (Keith
Curran). Unaccountably turned even more rapacious than his
father in the interim, Stanley now wants to wrest control of
J.J.'s empire from Cis and her husband (Walter Hudson), who
have been cooking the books while J.J. was out of commission.
J.J., who has ceased to care, dies as the casino -- "this
Club Med of the living dead" -- burns down.
   Lots of promising material here, but alas, not a
"Mahagonny" for the '90s, although its themes recall the
Brecht-Weill opera of 1930. Plot points are told, not acted,
and big chunks of motivation are missing. Why does Stanley do
such a complete about-face? Who is the nurse, besides a part
for Ms. Morris, Mr. Bolcom's gifted wife and duo partner?
Thomas Babe was called in, too late, as play doctor on
"Casino Paradise."
   With a solid frame to hold them together, Messrs. Bolcom
and Weinstein's splendidly inventive songs might have added
up to a terrific show. As it is, there are too many songs
following closely upon each other, and their popular rhythms
(tangos, fox trots, rhumbas, ballads) make them sound alike.
   Mr. Weinstein certainly has a way with words, and you want
to catch every one. Who can resist the love song "I'll Be By"
(sung by Stanley to the transvestite, Sunny), which has the
lyric, "Any bridge you're burning/Any trick you're turning/No
one but me shall lay his head/On your well-traveled thigh."
One was thus doubly grateful for Ms. Morris's crystal-clear
diction: Her shapely ballad "The Nurse's Song" was another
high point.
   Timothy Nolen's frayed upper register and insufficiently
imposing stage presence left J.J. a cipher, and Mr. Korbich
was weak and whiny as Stanley. The evening perked up with the
tall, hairy-chested, bearded Mr. Curran in a
spaghetti-strapped hooker's shift and sequined handbag, and
Ms. Metz as a Daddy's girl turned vicious in her blood-red
wedding gown (Candice Donnelly did the costumes). David
Alden's direction stressed economy of movement and symbolic
gesture over naturalism on the bare-bones set, echoing the
show's depiction of the characters as types, not people.
Michael Barrett led an able instrumental ensemble.
   "Casino Paradise" recalls Mr. Bolcom's gargantuan "Songs
of Innocence and Experience," produced several years ago at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, in which the composer seemed
too carried away by all his wonderful ideas he had to think
about and how they would hang together. His streamlined,
jazzy violin concerto, on the other hand, like "Cabaret
Songs," successfully represents Mr. Bolcom in a more focused
mood. The next Bolcom/Weinstein production, a full-scale
opera called "McTeague," based on the Frank Norris novel of
1899 about a renegade dentist and his covetous wife, now
being written for a 1992 production at the Chicago Lyric
Opera, already has enlisted a scenario from Robert Altman. Is
Mr. Bolcom beginning to see the light?
