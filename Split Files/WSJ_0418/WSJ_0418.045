   TORONTO -- Baton Broadcasting Inc. launched a lawsuit
against Canada's national newspaper, the Globe &amp; Mail, and
one of its reviewers over a negative article about a
television movie. The Globe &amp; Mail is owned by Thomson Corp.,
a Toronto-based publishing, printing and travel conglomerate.
   Baton, which financed the movie, is seeking 8 million
Canadian dollars (US$6.8 million) in damages, including C$1
million in special damages for loss of business, and C$1
million in aggravated and punitive damages.

   Baton alleges in a statement of claim filed with the
Supreme Court of Ontario that Globe &amp; Mail reviewer John
Haslett Cuff intended to leave readers with the impression
that Baton financed the film "for dishonourable motives," and
that the broadcasting concern "lacked talent, intelligence
and skill in the production of television programs."
   Baton said in the statement of claim that because of the
article, it has "suffered injury to its character, credit and
reputation and damage to its trade and business." It said it
has lost the chance to sell the film for future distribution.
   The television movie, concerning the life of a
nineteenth-century Mohawk Indian leader, Joseph Brant, aired
on Canadian television Feb. 13. The article by Mr. Haslett
Cuff appeared Feb. 10, under the headline "Banal `epic' a
costly disappointment."
   Neither Mr. Haslett Cuff nor officials of the Globe &amp; Mail
could be reached for comment.
