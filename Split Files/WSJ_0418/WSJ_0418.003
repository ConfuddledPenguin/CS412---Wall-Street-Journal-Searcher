   THE TABOO HAS LONG been lifted from talk about alcohol and
drugs. Sex? Just flip on your TV set.
   But there's another three-letter word that's still
shrouded in inhibitions. It's PAY. The less said about it,
the better, a lot of people on both sides of the paycheck
believe.

   Public companies, of course, must disclose top executives'
salaries, and labor contracts are public knowledge. But
between Ross Johnson and the union hall, most salaries are
discussed in whispers, if at all. Paychecks come in sealed
envelopes, and some companies forbid employees to disclose
their salaries.
   Talking about pay "borders on the vulgar," declares Lyle
Clapper, co-owner of Clapper Communications, a Park Ridge,
Ill., publisher. "It's a real emotional issue, and (in
business) emotional issues need to be quiet."
   Employees, too, are queasy. Etta Williams, a claims
representative at Allstate Insurance Co.'s Cheshire, Conn.,
office, says colleagues applauded her at a recent ceremony
where she was awarded a special cash bonus. But she didn't
want Allstate to announce the amount. "You're dealing with
human beings," warns Ms. Williams. "So far we get along great
here, and I'd like to keep it that way."
   Pay secrecy, however, is becoming an increasingly
difficult policy to maintain, particularly as companies look
to strengthen the link between pay and performance. At the
same time, employees are less willing to accept the company
line on pay. And as they begin to bargain individually over
such options as flexible schedules or part-time work, says
Elaine Evans, a consultant with Wyatt Co., "they are saying,
`Why can't I know about pay?'"
   Next Inc. may be the only major company in the U.S. where
the answer is, "You can." Lists of all employees' salaries
hang in company offices at Redwood City and Fremont, Calif.,
and anyone can consult them. "We're not dancing around the
problem," says Phillip E. Wilson, vice president of human
resources for the computer company started by Steve Jobs, the
cofounder of Apple Computer Co. Anything less than openness,
he says, "doesn't establish the same level of trust." Next's
attitude, he adds, was a major draw in wooing him from
Cummins Engine Co., which keeps a much tighter clamp on
salary data. But Mr. Wilson admits that such a "huge cultural
shift" is easier for a startup company like Next.
   "Once you're in it, it makes perfect sense. You wonder why
other companies don't do it," says Kathryn Kilcoyne, director
of marketing communications for Next. She has seen many new
hires at Next react to the news of its policy incredulously,
saying, "You do? They know?" Ms. Kilcoyne herself was
"extremely apprehensive about it" at first, but she's found
it makes managing easier. Now, when she interviews potential
new employees, if they express too much caution about the
idea, she questions whether they will fit into the Next
culture.
   Most companies experimenting with openness seek a balance
between old ways and new. Vanessa Jorgenson, a Calfed Inc.
branch manager, was old school when it came to pay. Before
she joined the bank two years ago, she was a manager in a
department store where, she says, "you didn't breathe
salaries." People figured that if employees learned what
others made, "who knew what else would come out?"
   Even at Calfed, when she joined the bank, pay information
traveled primarily by the grapevine, she says, and a manager
heard about it only when someone "up and walked out the
door." If Ms. Jorgenson got a complaint, it would be a long
game of "telephone" just to get the necessary information to
explain employee salaries, let alone act on it.
   But today Calfed is a more open company, and she finds out
faster whether ill will over pay is eroding morale. She has,
she says, a better chance of keeping people she has trained
and invested in. And Ms. Jorgenson now is armed with facts
and figures. Calfed's new Pay for Performance guide has a
bold, four-inch green dollar sign on its cover and data
inside ranging from how to compute a merit increase to salary
brackets for every job. She can share the contents with
employees and use this information in discussing pay with
them. And she can tap into Calfed's data banks to find out
how much other branches -- or competitors -- are paying.
   If someone complains that Joe Schmo is making more, "first
you figure out whether Joe Schmo is making more," says Ms.
Jorgenson. She won't disclose Joe's exact salary to the
complaining employee. But, if appropriate, she may make up
the difference. Or she may explain why Joe should be making
more. Maybe he supervises more people than the employee who's
complaining; maybe he was hired with higher expectations on
the company's part and "if (he) doesn't perform within 90
days, (he) may not have a job."
   Once employees know their boss will answer such questions,
says Ms. Jorgenson, word gets around. Before, she says, "it
was always taboo in their eyes; you just didn't ask."
   Traditionally, in fact, that's the way companies liked it.
Bob Baird, who taught training at the General Motors
Institute in the 1970s, remembers signing a form that barred
him from discussing his own salary. Fewer companies now take
that tack, but it isn't unheard of. In fact, although General
Motors Corp.'s operating companies have never required it,
says a spokeswoman, GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit
is adamant on the subject. New hires, says spokesman Roger
Still, sign a form acknowledging several policies, including
this one: Employees are allowed to disclose their salaries,
but if such disclosure leads to "disruption," they can be
fired.
   In many companies, the message trickles down even if it
isn't written down. Fran Stetson, a secretary for Health
Northeast in Manchester, N.H., says that managers at her
former office made sure that even the payroll accountant
caught their "paranoia. If you walked into her office while
she was working on it, she'd literally throw herself over the
desk."
   U.S. courts have generally supported companies in their
view that salary information, like a product formula or a
marketing strategy, is confidential and the property of
management. An employee who ferrets out and releases such
data can be discharged for "willful misconduct," says Mark
Dichter, an attorney at Morgan Lewis Bockius in Philadelphia.
In a legal battle concerning overtime pay at NBC News,
employees earlier this month won a ruling that management
must release to them the salaries of top staffers. But the
plaintiffs' use of the information was limited so that none
of it can be disclosed to anyone else.
   For many years, the cloak over salary served a dark
purpose. "There were no (pay) systems, no grades," says Fred
Cook, a New York consultant. "Pay was (figured) on the back
of an envelope, women got screwed, favorite sons were taken
care of."
   And managers saw the confidential information as a
critical element of control. "Giving pay information to a
subordinate . . . empowers" him, says Ed Lawler, a professor
at the University of Southern California. Of course, it also
opens to scrutiny the boss's own salary. When Mr. Wilson
described Next's open policy to a group of counterparts at
Fortune 200 companies recently, their reactions, he says,
were "Ridiculous] Impossible]" The sticking point? "Primarily
the notion that you can never sufficiently defend to the
ordinary folk (what) you pay to senior people."
   But even companies ready to open up have to fight a
psychology that is ingrained long before an executive or an
employee goes to work. "Lots of people don't talk to their
children about money any more than they talk to them about
sex," says Linda Barbanel, a therapist who specializes in
money matters. "So the same sorts of feelings get attached;
it's dirty and it's not nice." Pay is doubly sensitive
because many Americans tie their ego directly to their
paycheck.
   Thus, employees often join the boss in keeping salaries
secret. "In a sense, it's a conspiracy between the individual
and management," says Prof. Lawler. "It's the old joke: I
don't talk about my pay because I'm embarrassed, and the
organization doesn't talk about it because they're
embarrassed."
   Employees may even be skittish about learning each other's
salaries. They are loath to know something that may only
anger them, says Ms. Barbanel, especially if they feel
powerless to do anything about it. Ms. Stetson, the Health
Northeast secretary, is furious about one colleague who makes
more than she does but who, Ms. Stetson feels, doesn't pull
her weight. "It just creates hard feelings" if you know what
other people make, she says. "Sometimes, ignorance is bliss."
   Sensitivity about money, in fact, is often compounded by
sensitivity about a closely related topic: performance. And
this is where the debate on openness is joined. "Some people
with exactly the same job description and years on the job
may be making more . . . than the person sitting right next
to them," says Mr. Still of EDS. Why? "Because maybe they're
doing a better job."
   For EDS, that's good reason to reject the open approach. A
critical competitive tool for the company, says Mr. Still, is
the manager's ability to motivate employees case by case.
"There's a lot of discretion given to managers," he explains.
"If the employees begin to manage that process themselves . .
. truly that takes that power away from (managers)."
   But Next's Ms. Kilcoyne argues, "Why do you need secrecy?"
She discusses salary details with her team of 12
subordinates, including how much a new hire should be paid or
who gets a bonus. Sure, it may be hard to hear that someone
else makes more, she admits. But if employees understand and
believe the system is fair, they're going to say,
"Absolutely, Phyllis deserves to get that."
   Mr. Wilson says the system works well partly because it
doesn't try to make the narrow pay distinctions other
compensation experts believe in. Next pays employees in the
same classification about the same salary. And when
executives get raises, they're likely to be in increments of
at least $5,000. "Don't pretend that . . . you can sort out
(more) variables of human behavior than we can balance in our
feeble minds," he warns.
   But that philosophy still doesn't have many believers,
even among advocates of openness. Richard Bevan, a vice
president of Towers Perrin, a compensation consultant, used
to be an "idealist" on the subject, he confesses. Now, he
says, "I'm a pragmatist." Even where a company has the most
rational system, he says, "life is too complicated" to
explain every detail to employees. It's not practical, he
adds, to justify to other employees why a fellow worker got a
good raise despite a poor performance rating: "He had some
family crisis for six months this year, really his
performance is better, plus we suspect that this type of
computer analyst is a rare bird.'"
   When a company lets everyone know the salary or bonus
budget, says Mr. Cook, the consultant, it runs into problems.
With a limited pool of money, some employees have to get only
"average" increases or less while others get more. What
manager, asks Mr. Cook, wants to motivate his employee by
saying, "Let me make sure you understand. You're average"?
   Some companies that want to reward employees for extra
productivity try to avoid dollars altogether. Clapper
Communications makes non-cash awards, such as microwave ovens
and diamond pendants. If employees get too much information
on salaries, says Mr. Clapper, "I get into the job of proving
to the whole company that my decisions are good. We're not
democracies. We're corporations."
   But where companies are pushing workplace democracy,
communication becomes critical. U.S. productivity problems
are partly a result of treating employees like children,
argues Next's Mr. Wilson. Letting employees in on salary data
is the same as letting them in on who might be a new
joint-venture partner, says Ms. Kilcoyne. The message is,
"You're on the inside, not the outside."
   Next recently promoted one manager, with a raise to
$36,000, after considering an outside hire for the same
opening at $45,000. Aware of the earlier plan, the manager
complained. Mr. Wilson explained that Next had decided to let
someone from inside grow into the job rather than buy a
higher level of experience. "I spend a lot of time educating
people" about how compensation works, he says.
   Managers at Donnelly Corp., a large manufacturer of
automotive glass based in Holland, Mich., believe that
employees should get salary data for the same reasons they
now get information on technology or markets. "We're
committed to getting people involved in decisions that have
to do with money," says Mr. Baird, the former instructor at
the GM Institute and now Donnelly's manager of organizational
development. Employees are elected from all company levels to
serve on committees that make decisions, from manufacturing
technique to pricing to benefits and pay brackets.
