   FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Bank AG said it has signed a letter
of intent to form a banking joint venture in East Germany
with Deutsche Kreditbank AG, the commercial banking arm of
Staatsbank, East Germany's central bank.
   The accord paves the way for West Germany's largest
commercial bank to take the leading role in the East German
financial industry when the country's monetary union with
West Germany is completed this summer. No financial details
were disclosed.

   Deutsche Bank said the East German partner will contribute
facilities for the creation of a branch network while
Deutsche Bank "contributes its know-how, its training
capacity and its organization."
   The joint venture will be formed once the necessary legal
framework is in place, Deutsche Bank said. Starting April 1,
East Germany introduced a Western-style commercial banking
system, but so far hasn't granted any banking licenses to any
West German or other foreign banks. All major West German
commercial banks are planning to set up a branch network in
the country once they are allowed to operate there.
   Under the old Communist regime, the Staatsbank had a
monopoly on all major financial transactions in East Germany,
combining both commercial and central bank activities. But
last month, the Staatsbank spun off its commercial banking
activities into Deutsche Kreditbank, which is now a joint
stock company temporarily owned by the Staatsbank.
   Beside Kreditbank, there are only savings banks and
cooperative banks operating in East Germany at the moment.
   Deutsche Bank disclosed in late March that it is in talks
with Kreditbank about various forms of cooperation and even
considering acquiring an interest in the East German bank.
Last month, Chairman Hilmar Kopper denied that it is weighing
taking a direct stake in Kreditbank, but expressed interest
in some of Kreditbank's facilities.
   At the time, Mr. Kopper said he would like to see about
250 Deutsche Bank branches with 4,000 to 6,000 employees in
the long term, but said the realization of that "vision" will
take several years.
   Kreditbank operates 150 branches all over East Germany and
has 9,000 employees.
