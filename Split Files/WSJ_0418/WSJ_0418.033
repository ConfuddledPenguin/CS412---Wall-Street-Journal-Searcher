   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said a
construction slowdown and poor weather in its Southern
operating regions drove down first-quarter profit about 10%
to $35.8 million, or 95 cents a share. The forest-products
concern earned $39.9 million, or $1.05 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue grew about 2% to $474.8 million
from $467 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Louisiana-Pacific closed at $42.875, down 75 cents.
