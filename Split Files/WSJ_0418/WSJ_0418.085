   The prognosis is well known: Ma Earth is said to have a
fever, and if we don't do something soon, she's going to
croak. What's worse, she won't go to her grave alone. She's
going to take all of us with her]

   Ma is mum, but her spokespeople will take to the streets
Sunday armed with bullhorns and a rap sheet: global warming,
acid rain, ozone depletion, Reagan's arms buildup, etc., etc.
   Not to dribble on the parade, but plenty of scientists
don't buy the near-death scenario. Just the other day, for
instance, a report on global warming during the 1980s stated,
"The Northern Hemisphere goes up slightly during those 10
years and the Southern Hemisphere goes down slightly. The net
effect for the globe is basically zero."
   Other data suggest many of our pollution problems, though
real, are not worthy of panic. But are we urged by the
experts to quietly collect the facts and then respond
accordingly? Or are we urged to act as if the Death Star had
just entered U.S. airspace? We know the answer. Quiet reason
is out. This is the age of the bogeyman.
   Let us peruse his library.
   "The earth is getting warmer," writes Jon Naar in "Design
for a Livable Planet" (Harper &amp; Row, 338 pages, $12.95).
"Glaciers are melting. Ocean levels are rising. The world's
climates are changing." That's not all, "The land is poisoned
with chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The seas are
cesspools of trash and toxic waste. There is even the danger
that atmospheric air pollution . . . has reached a point of
no return, that the impact of existing pollution will
radically change our climate regardless of what preventative
measures we take."
   There is the additional danger that many of Mr. Naar's
more sensitive readers have just wet their pants. If more
prompting is needed, the author also quotes a "radon
specialist" at the Environmental Defense Fund (the executive
director of which wrote the book's introduction): "From all
the evidence, radon in the home is the most deadly
environmental hazard in America today."
   A feature on radiation seeping quietly into places such as
your baby's crib is entitled "Silent Holocaust," and several
pages later, this quote from author Robert O. Becker jumps
out of the bushes and shouts: "We have evidence that man-made
electronic fields from power lines are far more productive of
serious health effects than cigarette smoking."
   As the government recently reminded us, 59 cigarette
deaths occur every 75 minutes. Are we really being zapped at
an equal rate? And if VDTs really do cause cancer, shouldn't
Joyce Carol Oates be dead by now? (And if she doesn't write
on a computer, is this the time to take up a collection to
buy her one?)
   Another area of concern is air pollution. Will Steger and
Jon Bowermaster have lots to say about it in "Saving The
Earth" (Knopf, 305 pages, $19.95). But wait a minute, fellas.
According to your book, Denver (No. 2 in the "dirty skies"
competition) has a horizon that is "blocked by a dirty brown
haze every other day." Now I know Denver. I work in Denver. I
wear corrective lenses. And I can tell you that the horizon
isn't blocked every other day -- far from it. Are you guys
trying to scare us?
   And what's all this drum-banging for alternative fuels?
You guys know they clean up some types of emissions but
increase others, including formaldehyde -- A KNOWN
CARCINOGEN] Nor is there reason to pant heavily for increased
tailpipe standards. In Denver, for instance, 80% of the
pollution is caused by 20% of the cars. New cars aren't the
problem.
   Besides, you're right about keeping our cars tuned up and
about the need for a change in some people's attitudes. Just
the other day, for instance, a local heavy-equipment operator
spoke these chilling words about her bulldozer: "I really
like that big puff of black smoke. There's such a sense of
control about it."
   Such statements are enough to send your average enviro
around the bend, where there's a good chance he or she will
bump into Gary Null, parts of whose "Clearer, Cleaner, Safer,
Greener" (Villard, 293 pages, $18.95) sound as if they were
written three weeks after the Thorazine bottle went dry.
Because he resembles a substantial portion of the
environmental community, let us put our foot on his throat
and declaim awhile.
   Mr. Null, a radio and television personality, could be
characterized as a fundamentalist tree hugger. For instance,
if you're against nuclear power, as he is, you are "in the
rational camp," while the opposition is "noticeably more
hysterical and reactionary."
   Now Mr. Null is entitled to his opinions, and we certainly
won't classify him with other anti-nuke activists such as the
Berrigan boys, one of whom was arrested for banging on a
nuclear warhead with a hammer. But we all know nuclear
protesters; some of us have fired on them with water cannons.
Committed, they are. Calm and rational? Come now.
   In the same vein, Mr. Null attempts to shake us up about
genetically engineered solutions to the European corn-borer
problem. First he states that "viruses and bacteria are
extremely dangerous organisms with which to be
experimenting," and then adds that "AIDS and many other
serious {]} illnesses are related to microbial infection."
Talk about a smear job. And what's more, Mr. Null is surely
aware that AIDS is not spread by boring corn. Isn't he?
   And while on the subject of food, Mr. Null has more bad
news: "American agriculture is teetering on the brink of
disaster and getting more vulnerable every day." It produces
food that "ceases to have any connection with nature, losing
much of its ability to heal and sustain us."
   This last statement will surprise those of us who have
lived many prosperous years on Velveeta and Big Macs. But
that statement is nothing compared with this howler:
"Notwithstanding the claims of our doctors and health
professionals that Americans are living longer than ever
before, you only have to look around to see that, as a
nation, we have never before been more unhealthy."
   "Claims" that we are living longer? "Death and Dying," an
authoritative source, puts the lie to Mr. Null and the rest
of the doom platoon. The fact is, this planet is more livable
than ever. Neanderthals (original versions) lived an average
of 29 years. Cro-Mags could expect to live 32; ancient Greeks
and Romans, 36 years; 14th-century Englanders, 38; and
20th-century Americans, 72 long ones.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Null wants us to "say `No' to ersatz
food," and promises, in return, a revival of the soul: "For
those of us who do care, food begins to take on an importance
equaling, if not surpassing, that placed on it by Europeans."
Can it really be? Well, one thing's for sure. Mr. Null is
going to be awfully upset when he dies, having spent so much
time making sure his melons were manure-red and otherwise
shopping as if the right purchases could help him evade the
Angel of Death.
   But enough bad news. What is to be done to "heal the
planet"?
   For one thing, bang anyone in the head who suggests that
nuclear power is an alternative for fossil fuels. So far, the
fear campaign has worked, at least according to "The
Greenpeace Book of the Nuclear Age" (Pantheon, 378 pages,
$14.95). "Homo sapiens retains a natural skepticism towards
nuclear matters," we learn, and it is encouraging to note
that radiophobia is one of the fastest growing human
attitudes in the world in all societies.
   That's a fairly questionable proposition, to be sure, but
it did sound scientific the way they started the sentence
with a reference to Homo sapiens, didn't it? This selfsame
creature also should adopt a "green lifestyle," and no green
Homo sapien would be without "The Green Consumer" (Tilden
Press/Penguin, 342 pages, $9.95) by John Elkington and Julia
Hailes and Joel Makower.
   This book isn't dripping with warm spit either, as
exemplified by the section entitled "How the American Way of
Life Is Destroying the Earth." We learn, among other things,
that each person in New York City produces 3.96 pounds of
trash each day, while in Calcutta, each person produces only
1.12 pounds. A role model, to be sure.
   And isn't it time, ask the authors of "Our Earth,
Ourselves" (Bantam, 340 pages, $10.95), that we learned from
"misadventures like South Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Lebanon
that we cannot be the policemen of the world"? Since
Nicaragua seems to have benefited from our policing, do the
authors take it back? Probably not, which brings up another
problem with many of these books. They are written as if to
purposefully alienate the anti-Dukakis community. In light of
this, we must applaud President Bush's decision not to
intervene in the coagulation of Boston Harbor, despite his
campaign rhetoric.
   Is there no levity in the Bogeyman Library? Yes. Michael
W. Fox supplies a couple of chuckles in the "The Green
Lifestyle Handbook" (Henry Holt, 196 pages, $10.95). "Dogs
have been sexually aroused by some hand creams," he reports,
and "Cats have gone berserk after their owners have put on
expensive perfume. One spry Siamese actually cornered his
owner in the bathroom for four hours."
   Mr. Fox really outdoes himself by leading off one chapter,
called "Cruelty-Free Living," with a quotation from Victor
Hugo. Granted, Old Vic may have talked a good game about
living with nature. But according to biographer Samuel
Edwards, every time he ate, the animal population dropped
considerably.
   Lunch, for example, often began with a pate, then fish,
followed by the main course, which usually was a roast of
beef, lamb, pork or veal. A respectful gorging in itself, but
dinner was the big meal. First course, a dozen or two
oysters, then sausages, often followed by lobsters ("and he
usually managed to down two of them," according to Mr.
Edwards, "chewing the shells as well as the lobster meat"). A
roasted chicken also was a mainstay ("Victor ate a young
chicken unaided") and then the main course, Beef Wellington,
likely as not. Perhaps a new poster boy should be recruited.
   In addition to loving the animals, Jeremy Rifkin, in the
introduction to "The Green Lifestyle Handbook," suggests we
learn to nuzzle the entire natural order. The "new,
post-modern view of science is based on empathy with the
environment as opposed to subjugation over it," he says. And
once we "engage nature on an intimate level," Mr. Rifkin
promises, "the relationship grows and deepens and becomes
more secure."
   There are pantheistic elements to some of these books, as
when Dr. Larry Dossey, also a handbook contributor, writes
that "our minds extend beyond ourselves, and are interlocked
in a give-and-take relationship not only with those of other
persons but of the Earth itself." And as my estimable
colleague Vincent Carroll discovered, the radical
environmental group Earth First] publishes its journal eight
times a year on the old pagan European nature holidays.
   While we can poke fun at these books, all of them contain
helpful information. My favorite is Marjorie Lamb's "Two
Minutes a Day for a Greener Planet" (Harper &amp; Row, 243 pages,
$7.95), which is three minutes a day longer than it takes to
flatten your stomach.
   And it is important to do something, if for no other
reason than practical mental health. That syndicated national
den mom Ellen Goodman shone her light on this dark situation
in a recent column:
   "It is an average day on the planet Earth. Acid rain is
falling on the city. The temperature is rising and you don't
know whether it's spring or the greenhouse effect. You drive
home counting the fossil fuels you're devouring . . . You
stop at the supermarket for this week's groceries, which are
next century's landfill . . . This is your life in the era of
eco-worry. The most quantifiable result of the environmental
movement is an anxious powerlessness growing across the
landscape like kudzu."
   Here's one thing Ms. Goodman can do, as suggested in
nearly every book. Instead of using deodorant, substitute a
mixture of baking soda and cornstarch. Sure, by the time you
get home from work you'll be carrying a couple of biscuits in
your armpits, but sacrifices must be made. And besides,
biscuits are biodegradable.
