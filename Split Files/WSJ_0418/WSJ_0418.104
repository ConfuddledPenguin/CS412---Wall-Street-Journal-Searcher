   LEAVE-SHARING BENEFITS in medical crises are taxable, the
IRS rules.
   Recognizing the financial strains of long-term disability,
more employers are letting employees donate leave time to
unfortunate co-workers who exhaust their paid time off; some
concerns even let workers deposit time in leave banks. Now
IRS Revenue Ruling 90-29 spells out the tax effects of a
typical company plan to aid workers who face a substantial
loss of income during prolonged medical emergencies affecting
themselves or members of their families.

   Under the plan, a worker who exhausts paid leave applies
in writing for leave surrendered by co-workers or drawn from
the bank and is paid at his normal rate. That added leave pay
is taxable compensation for the worker's services, the IRS
says, and is subject to tax withholding, the Social Security
tax and the unemployment tax.
   Workers who give up leave don't realize income -- nor do
they incur deductible expenses or losses, even when someone
else uses their leave, the IRS says.
                                                                                                       

   DON'T HANG UP cellular-phone deductions with
record-keeping, lawyers urge.
   As more and more motorists whizzed by with phones glued to
their ears, the 1989 tax act tightened restrictions on
business deductions for cellular phones bought after 1989.
Now users must have records separating business calls from
personal ones. If business use isn't substantiated,
employer-supplied phones turn into taxable income for
employees. Does this call for hanging a logbook from the
rear-view mirror or for combing through monthly bills to
identify deductible conversations? It surely does.
   But two Washington lawyers, Mary B. Hevener and Annette
Guarisco, are asking the IRS for relief from record-keeping;
they suggest a rule like an existing one for
employer-provided cars: If an employer's policy forbade all
but very limited personal use of its cellular phones,
employees wouldn't have to keep records. Tax officials
indicate informally that such a rule seems reasonable, Ms.
Hevener says.
                                                                                                       

   THE IRS BLOCKS a corporate maneuver to use up tax-loss
carry-forwards.
   The 1987 tax act aimed to stop companies with big unused
carry-forwards from buying other companies and selling their
assets to take advantage of built-in value gains that would
offset the carry-forwards. The act provides that those
pre-acquisition losses may not offset built-in gains
recognized in the first five years after acquisition.
Naturally, companies soon saw that they could get around this
by selling assets for installment notes due after the five
years -- when the gain would be recognized.
   Now, notes Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton, the
IRS has used its rule-writing authority to squelch such
installment plans. Notice 90-27 warns that the IRS will issue
regulations providing that for an installment sale occurring
within the first five years, the disqualifying period will be
extended to include the final installment payment's due date.
   This broadening of the 1987 law to preclude the
installment-sale maneuver took effect March 26.
                                                                                                       

   THE PERSONAL EXEMPTION rises in 1990 to $2,050, adjusted
for inflation, from $2,000 in 1989; indexing rules rounded
the increase down to the nearest $50. So a bill by Rep.
Hastert (R., Ill.) would round off the adjustment to the
nearest $10 -- lifting the 1990 exemption to $2,090.
                                                                                                       

   A MORMON COUPLE'S deduction of gifts to support two
missionary sons was denied by the IRS as a personal expense
and is being reviewed by the Supreme Court. Sen. Symms (R.,
Idaho) has entered a bill to treat gifts to missionaries as
deductible charitable donations to a church.
                                                                                                       

   RETURN CHECK-OFFS designating $1 of tax for the
presidential-election fund have been lagging, the Federal
Election Commission warns. Now three Democratic senators have
proposed a bill that would raise the check-off amount to $3
and require the commission and the IRS to publicize it.
                                                                                                       

   MAIL-ORDER RETAILERS lean on computers to cope with 50,000
sales taxes.
   More states are requiring out-of-state retailers to
collect state and city sales taxes for them. But how can
mail-order companies keep up with rates and requirements of
50,000 jurisdictions? Leased computer software is easing the
compliance burden. Vertex, a Berwyn, Pa., software producer,
says revenue from its system rose over 50% last year because
more retailers "find it cheaper to comply than to fight"
states' demands. Vertex charges $12,000 for the first year
and under $10,000 a year thereafter.
   AVP Systems of Marblehead, Mass., finds orders for
compliance software growing as states intensify their
vigilance and more retailers agree to collect and remit
taxes. AVP says new contracts for its system, which may be
leased for about $7,000 a year, also increased more than 50%
in 1989. Users of compliance software get monthly updates of
sales-tax changes.
   In the last six months, New York says, 179 out-of-state
companies have registered to collect its taxes.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Tomorrow, the House Ways and Means Oversight
Subcommittee is to begin a series of hearings on narrowing
the gap between taxes due and taxes paid. The first
categories on the agenda include sole proprietors and small
and large corporations. . . . Henry H. Philcox fills the new
IRS post of chief information officer, responsible for
information-technology systems. . . . The IRS awarded a
contract to the National Academy of Sciences to review its
critical systems-modernization efforts.
