   With equipment rivals hot on its trail, American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. is racing to develop optical communications
products that can maximize the potential of fiber-optic
networks and revolutionize communications for home and
office.
   Super high-speed light signals transmitted via fiber-optic
systems can transport vast amounts of voice, data and
television signals through ultrapure glass fibers the
thickness of hair. The industry calls this broadband
transmission.

   But these signals must be converted to comparatively
sluggish electronic signals before they can pass through the
matrix of electronic gates that form current computerized
exchanges. The challenge is to develop optical switches to
eliminate that costly and inefficient conversion and unleash
the full power of fiber-optics.
   AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories successfully demonstrated last
January an awkward-looking processor that did numerical
calculations using light beams. Today, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert
E. Allen is to tell the company's shareholders at its annual
meeting in Los Angeles that AT&amp;T will begin shipping
communications products using the new technology in about
five years.
   Several teams of Bell Labs scientists and engineers have
begun designing prototype telecommunications products, using
as their guide the designs of Alan Huang and his team of
researchers who developed the AT&amp;T optical processor.
   "Every big phone company, including all the Bell
companies, is betting on broadband transmission in the future
to handle such things as high-definition TV and fax. And
broadband networks will transmit communications traffic in
terabits, or trillions of bits per second," says H. Scott
Hinton, chief of Bell Labs' photonic switching department.
AT&amp;T's flagship electronic digital switch, the 5ESS,
currently handles five billion bits per second. "We'll need
switches that are three orders of magnitude more powerful
than conventional systems," Mr. Hinton says.
   AT&amp;T itself could benefit from using optical switches to
accommodate heavy traffic. AT&amp;T is the world's largest
carrier of long-distance voice and data traffic. And it is
adding new traffic-intensive services, including network
management for big corporate customers and financial services
for businesses and consumers.
   Mr. Hinton acknowledges that Japanese suppliers present
the biggest long-term threat. NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi
ELECTRIC Co. have already displayed their own prototypes of
optical processors. And Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. is
working hard on the technology, and could license its designs
to its key equipment suppliers, NEC and Fujitsu Ltd.
   AT&amp;T's equipment arm, AT&amp;T Network Systems, has been
struggling to fend off foreign rivals in the market for
highly complex switching systems used to route telephone
traffic. Furthermore, orders for these switching systems are
tapering off and profits from them are razor thin, so AT&amp;T's
rivals -- chiefly Japan's NEC and Fujitsu, Canada's Northern
Telecom Ltd. and France's Alcatel N.V. -- are focusing on the
market for the transmission equipment that pumps phone
traffic.
   In just five years, NEC and Fujitsu have built an
impressive base in the U.S. fiber-optic transmission
equipment market, capturing a combined 16% vs. AT&amp;T's 52%,
Rockwell International Corp.'s 21% and Northern Telecom's 6%,
according to Northern Business Information/Datapro, a market
research firm based in New York.
   A dogfight has already broken out over a new group of
fiber-optic products built to a new industry standard called
Sonet, or Synchronous Optical Network. Developed by Bell
Communications Research and the world's telecommunications
authorities, the Sonet industry standard is expected to
expand the base of transmission equipment suppliers, thus
increasing competition. Sonet should also allow the phone
companies to improve maintenance and boost profits by weeding
out inefficient systems that need a lot of expensive gear to
help them communicate.
   This battle is expected to produce a huge market as phone
companies accelerate their installation plans. From next to
nothing today, the Sonet business will hit $250 million by
1994 and quadruple that by 1997, predicts Michael Miller, an
analyst at Northern Business Information/Datapro. After 2000,
the sky could be the limit as the phone companies begin to
transform all of their networks -- down to the last mile to
home and office -- to Sonet systems.
   "Under the Sonet concept, control is no longer centralized
in the switch, but decentralized so that the user, which
could be the phone company or a big corporate network center,
has more control over their communications transmission,"
says Eli Noam, a commissioner with New York's Public Service
Commission and founding director of Columbia University's
Center for Telecommunications and Information Studies.
   None of these Sonet-based systems will work to full
potential until engineers develop optical exchanges with the
capacity to handle the enormous amounts of traffic generated
by photonic transmission systems.
   AT&amp;T is off to a good start. Bell Labs engineers made two
significant breakthroughs in the last few months on optical
technology. In December, AT&amp;T announced that its scientists
had developed a combined photonic and electronic integrated
circuit to process information. The gallium-arsenide chip
contains 2,048 devices called S-SEEDs, or symmetric self
electro-optic effect devices, and works something like an
electronic transistor. This means that light beams can be
switched on and off -- the manner in which computers
communicate and do calculations -- in less than one billionth
of a second.
   Moreover, on April 11 AT&amp;T announced at a computer
symposium in Kobe, Japan, that its scientists had built a
connecting device for linking integrated circuits in an
optical network. The modules contain surface-emitting lasers,
lenses and mirrors in a sandwich-like quartz chip that is
one-eighth of an inch thick and one inch in diameter. In
effect, these devices should enable Bell labs scientists to
shrink Mr. Huang's crude-looking optical processor and begin
implementing the design in AT&amp;T's future switches.
   The first of these systems will be introduced in 1995, say
individuals familiar with AT&amp;T's plans. The system, called a
digital access cross-connect, or DACCS, is a transmission
system that actually works as a switch to transfer traffic
from one high-speed trunk line to another and convert the
traffic to lower speed electronic signals that can be handled
by the central office switch. With an optical DACCS, phone
companies will be able to switch broadband traffic and send
it to the home or office. After 1995, these individuals say,
AT&amp;T will insert an optical switch into its flagship
electronic exchange, the 5ESS, turning the local switching
office in phone networks into an exchange with several
thousand times the capacity of today's switches.
   Where these optical systems will first find their way into
the nation's phone system is unknown, but AT&amp;T insiders say
AT&amp;T itself will likely test the systems in its own
long-distance network within three years before offering them
to the Bell companies.
