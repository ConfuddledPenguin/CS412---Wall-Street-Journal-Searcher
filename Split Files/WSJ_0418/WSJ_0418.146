   LOS ANGELES -- Michael Jay has made a profitable business
of playing David to the Goliaths of the credit-reporting
industry, pledging to help consumers clean up their credit
records by challenging "the giants that control your credit
future."
   His Michael Jay &amp; Co. is one of hundreds of so-called
credit-repair clinics that have sprung up in recent years. An
inevitable offspring of the buy-now-pay-later mentality of
the 1980s, these small businesses claim they can fix a
client's credit record, but at a cost of several hundred
dollars or more. They achieve this feat by invoking a clause
in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requiring credit
bureaus to verify any items on a person's record that he or
she may dispute. If the item can't be verified, it must be
removed from the record.

   But now the giants are fighting back. Earlier this month,
TRW Inc. sued Michael Jay &amp; Co. in a Los Angeles state court
for allegedly advising consumers to flood it with "frivolous"
credit disputes and lawsuits, and also for allegedly trying
to tamper with TRW's computer system. Mr. Jay denied both
allegations.
   The next day, the Federal Trade Commission informed Mr.
Jay it had obtained evidence that his company was "engaging
in unfair and deceptive practices," and that it would sue him
unless he entered into negotiations to reach a "voluntary
consent agreement" with the agency.
   To critics, companies like Mr. Jay's show that one way to
start a successful small business is to turn yourself into a
thorn in the side of big business. Mr. Jay insists that he's
performing a necessary function, and that he's just
encountering the perils of any entrepreneur who has taken on
a corporate titan. The ruckus simply indicates that he's
causing discomfort to the credit bureaus, he adds.
   The 39-year-old British native started his company after
moving here from London in 1986. "I had no credit at all
here, and I was very frustrated," Mr. Jay says. "So I bought
every book I could on the subject. These books also discussed
repairing and improving credit."
   What he discovered is that "the credit-reporting bureaus
aren't in the business of helping people attack them. When
you try to dispute an item on your record, the
credit-reporting agencies ignore you. That's why customers
arrive at our door." He says the company serves about 2,500
clients a year, double the number of clients it handled two
years ago.
   Ostensibly, credit-repair clinics are supposed to help
consumers whose credit records contain incorrect or outdated
information. But the clinics also appeal to people with bad
credit histories who are looking to beat the system. That's
what has the credit agencies -- particularly the "Big Three"
of TRW, Trans Union Credit Information Co. and Equifax Inc.
-- fighting mad.
   That's also what has attracted the FTC. According to Ann
Guler, an FTC investigator, "They're promising to do what
simply can't be done." The FTC has sued numerous credit
clinics for deceptive ads. In addition, more than 20 states
have enacted legislation to regulate credit repair. Georgia
outlaws it altogether.
   Although Mr. Jay acknowledges his industry has "a poor
reputation," he insists he isn't deceiving customers into
believing they can remove accurate data from reports, as the
FTC and TRW claim. "The advertising that will attract the
most calls is the kind that promises to `erase bad credit.'
We don't say that," he says. "If they say the data on their
credit report is accurate, we say we can't help them."
   Indeed, in its contracts and correspondence with
customers, Michael Jay &amp; Co. warns consumers not to make
"untrue or misleading" statements to the credit bureaus.
Still, the company makes much of the fact that information on
credit reports can be removed if not verified. Take a recent
newspaper ad that reads: "Lates -- Charge Offs -- Repo's? The
law provides for prompt deletion of inaccurate, outdated or
UNVERIFIED negative information."
   Mr. Jay and his staff of 20 go about getting negative
items removed by writing letters to the credit bureaus, three
letters for each disputed item. The letters are purposely
vague, saying only that the senders dispute certain items. No
specific reasons are given, nor do the letters claim that the
disputed items are incorrect. Mr. Jay says using this format
saves money on computer processing. But more importantly, his
firm isn't liable if a customer lies to him about the
accuracy of a credit report. Each letter must be approved and
sent by the customer, since the law requires consumers to
complain directly to the bureaus rather than through a third
party.
   Mr. Jay claims that in about half the cases, the
customers' records are corrected within four months at a cost
to the consumer of $95 to $195 a month.
   Increasingly, however, credit bureaus have ignored Mr.
Jay's correspondence, arguing that since it comes from a
credit-repair clinic, it's "frivolous." The Fair Credit
Reporting Act requires a bureau to investigate a dispute
"unless there is reasonable grounds to believe that it is
frivolous or irrelevant." Susan Murdy, spokeswoman for TRW's
Credit Data Division in Orange, Calif., says the firm's
policy is to reject disputes generated by credit-repair
clinics. "We do not deal with third parties. Generally, they
use a form letter that we can identify."
   The FTC, in a staff opinion, has said the credit bureaus
can't treat a dispute as irrelevant simply because it comes
from a credit-repair clinic. But "that can be a factor in
determining that a complaint is frivolous," says Ms. Guler,
the FTC investigator. Other factors include "if every item is
disputed, or if no reasons are given for the disputes," she
says.
   With his letters being ignored, Mr. Jay's firm in recent
months has been hauling the credit bureaus into small claims
court on behalf of clients. Mr. Jay says his company has
filed 25 such actions and has gotten upgraded reports for at
least 10 clients. Needless to say, TRW doesn't like this
tactic, either. It alleges in its complaint that it amounts
to "the unauthorized practice of law."
