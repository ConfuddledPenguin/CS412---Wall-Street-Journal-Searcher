   After the $23-an-ounce sell-off in gold a couple of weeks
ago, some investors believe that now is the time to buy
precious metals. For these intrepid bottom fishers, an
intriguing choice is Central Fund of Canada.
   Despite its lofty name, Central does little more than buy
silver and gold in chunks and put them away for safekeeping.
The stock closed yesterday on the American Stock Exchange at
4 15/16, a smidgen below the $5-a-share value of the fund's
assets, which are 95% precious metals with a bias toward
silver.

   "Investors who buy this fund are getting a substitute for
owning bullion," says Ken Gettinger, vice president, precious
metals, at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. He says the
fund has a high "comfort factor" for small investors, in part
because it can be easily traded by calling a broker.
   Two other common choices of small investors both have
drawbacks. Mining companies aren't pure plays on the metals
they mine as they also reflect mining costs, reserves and
metal inventories. Bullion coins often have sizable gaps
between their buying and selling prices and must be stored
after purchase.
   Central, which handles shareholder inquiries in Ancaster,
Ontario, spends about 1% of its net asset value on storage
and other costs each year. That's just about what an
individual would pay to store bullion or coins.
   The only reason for investors to buy Central, analysts
warn, is if they expect big gains in the price of silver, or
gold, or both. Especially silver. A buyer of Central shares
gets the company's ratio of 49.2 ounces of silver to one
ounce of gold. (In the spot market yesterday gold was at
$375.20 an ounce, about 74 times silver's $5.09.)
   A few investors have recently begun dabbling in silver
stocks, predicting an end to the heavy supply that has driven
the metal close to a 12-year low. In 1985, gold had sunk to
$300 an ounce but as recently as 1988 was more than $500 an
ounce.
   Central, a publicly traded or "closed-end" concern that
became a bullion fund in 1983, owns 116,205 ounces of gold
bullion and certificates for an additional 13,000. It owns
6,138,615 ounces of silver bullion and certificates for
221,750 more. The metal is stored on a segregated basis in
the vaults of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
   Central typically posts annual losses because of operating
costs. Assessing results can be an adventure because of the
different ways U.S. and Canadian accountants view unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of assets. For the three months
ended Jan. 31, under generally accepted Canadian accounting
principles, Central had a loss of $155,014. Under U.S.
principles it had a $5,614,845 profit.
   Robert Kinsman, editor of the "Low-Risk Growth Letter,"
says the stock has other advantages besides convenience. "I
like the idea that it can be shorted for those who are
bearish on the metals," he says. Of course, the stock is
naturally most attractive when it is selling at a discount to
its net asset value. In December 1984 it sold at a 28.5%
discount to net asset value when gold was at $324 an ounce
and silver at $6.82. On the day it reached its maximum
premium to net asset value -- 23.6%in April 1987, the stock
also reached an alltime high of 8 3/8. At that time, gold was
selling for $432 and silver for $6.90 an ounce.
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors in Toronto, says gold's recent price slump was
psychologically and technically damaging. But he predicts
that "before the decade is out, gold will set new historic
highs -- over $800 an ounce," reflecting stagnation in supply
growth and increased demand for gold in jewelry.
   Silver hasn't the admirers in the Middle East and Far East
that gold does, Mr. Nichols says: "I see it as simply a
commodity for short-term speculative players."
   Investors shouldn't buy Central for income because it
doesn't have very many ways to produce it. According to Paul
Gratton, president of Central Group Ltd., the administrator
of Central Fund, the company doesn't sell calls against its
inventory, as this would violate its conservative investment
policy. The fund did sell calls from 1984 through 1986, but
quit when shareholders complained that such a strategy was
inappropriate for long-term bulls on the precious metals.
(The owner of a call option has the right to buy or "call
away" bullion in this case at a specified price for a limited
time.)
   Dennis Suskind, a partner at Goldman Sachs, sees a rough
road ahead this year for gold, with the metal likely to move
lower. He's more optimistic about silver. "No matter what
happens to gold, every time silver gets near $5 an ounce the
selling seems to dry up," he says. And when gold took its
recent hit, silver fell only eight cents an ounce.
