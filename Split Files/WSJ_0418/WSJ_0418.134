   AM International Inc. said a "significant charge" in its
fiscal third quarter ending April 30 -- related to a
reorganization of the company -- will result in a loss for
the quarter. The company wouldn't specify the amount of the
charge or projected loss.
   In the year-earlier third quarter, AM earned $8.1 million,
or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $223 million.

   The Chicago-based graphics equipment concern said the
charge is the result of its strategic plan to focus on its
core business -- which prints business forms -- by disposing
of non-core business units.
   AM said it has agreed to sell its Digi Electronic Products
unit to Barco N.V., a Belgian-based company, for $8 million.
Last month, AM agreed to sell two other non-core business
units, AM Technologies and its machine tool business of AM
Wohlenberg.
   The company said the revamping also includes the
previously announced consolidation of its Multigraphics and
International divisions; the segmenting of the company's AM
Graphics business into separate units; and further
consolidations of its European operations. AM will also write
down the assets of its computer graphics business.
   The graphics equipment concern also said that while it
expects to post a profit in the fourth quarter, the
"magnitude of the restructuring charge will eliminate that
profit," resulting in a loss for the year. For the year ended
July 31, 1989, AM earned $31 million, or 46 cents a share, on
revenue of $850.6 million.
