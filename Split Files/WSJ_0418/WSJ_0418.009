   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built vehicles in early
April fell 11.2% from a year ago, tempering some optimism
generated by a 2.9% rise in late March.
   The 10 companies that build vehicles in the U.S. sold
262,692 cars, vans and light trucks in the April 1-10 period,
down from 295,735 vehicles a year ago, despite deep discounts
and other incentives. Analysts attributed the lackluster
performance to a still-sluggish economy.

   "For a spring selling market still characterized by
incentives, these numbers don't look so good," said Tom Webb,
chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association. "Unless there is a major change in the economy,
such as reduced interest rates, domestic new cars sales
appear to remain in their current doldrums."
   Following recent patterns, the drop in car sales was
steeper than that for van and light trucks. Auto makers
reported they sold 163,585 cars built in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico during the period, down 13.3% from a year ago.
Domestic truck and van sales fell 7.5% to 99,107 vehicles.
   Car sales yielded a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.6
million cars, according to a Department of Commerce formula.
That's down from late March's 7.2 million rate and the 7.6
million pace of a year ago.
   Despite the overall downturn, the seven Japanese companies
that build cars in the U.S. increased the number and
percentage of car sales they made to 21,062, or 12.9%, from
13,894, or 7.4% a year ago.
   Among the Big Three U.S. auto makers, General Motors Corp.
reported a 13.6% drop in domestic car sales, but a 2.2%
improvement in light truck sales, partly because GM has added
a trio of plastic-body minivans to its truck lineup. GM was
the only one of the Big Three that didn't lose ground
year-to-year in the truck market.
   Ford Motor Co. attributed its relatively weak sales to big
incentives that boosted sales a year ago. In the most-recent
10-day period, Ford's U.S. car sales dropped 20.7%, while
truck sales declined 9.3%.
   Company officials have said the introduction of the 1991
Escort subcompact car later this month will help sales;
Escort has been one of Ford's best-selling cars.
   Despite the lower truck sales, a Ford spokesman said the
company is pleased with customer reaction to its Explorer
sport utility vehicle. Ford has sold almost 15,000 of the
Bronco II replacements since they made their debut in
mid-March, the spokesman said.
   Sales at Chrysler Corp. continued to plummet. The auto
maker's domestic car sales declined 29.2%, while sales of
light trucks, which include Chrysler's minivans, dropped
24.9%.
   Meanwhile, five of the Japanese auto makers that build
cars in the U.S. reaped gains from plant capacity brought on
line since last year. Toyota Motor Corp. nearly doubled its
sales of domestically produced cars, while Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. nearly tripled its sales.
   Honda Motor Corp. registered a 17% gain. Fuji Heavy
Industries, which markets Subaru vehicles, and Isuzu Motors
Ltd. only recently began reporting sales of the cars and
trucks produced at their joint venture plant in Lafayette,
Ind.
   The total for sales of all vehicles reported for early
April, including imported vehicles sold by the U.S. Big
Three, was 270,386, down 11.9% from a year ago.
