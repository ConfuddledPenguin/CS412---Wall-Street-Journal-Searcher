   DETROIT -- Manufacturers National Corp. said it has taken
a pretax charge of $6 million in the first quarter of 1990
for estimated expenses associated with the consolidation of
its Illinois banks.
   The bank-holding company said it expects first-quarter
earnings will fall compared with a year ago as a result of
the charge, but the company didn't provide further details.
For the first quarter of 1989, Manufacturers National
reported net income of $24.8 million, or $1.64 a share. The
company said it will announce on Friday earnings for the
quarter ended March 31.
