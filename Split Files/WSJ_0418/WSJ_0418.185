   LONDON -- Not that long ago, executive pay in Europe
lagged so far behind the princely sums handed out in the U.S.
that the gap seemed nearly unbridgeable. To a lot of people
like Robert Horton, it must still look that way.
   In 1988 he was posted from the U.S., where he headed
British Petroleum Co.'s American unit, back to Britain, where
he rejoined the parent's governing board. With this promotion
-- he was widely viewed as a candidate for the top job at BP
and has since become chairman -- he took a pay cut of 60%

   But a lot of other people like Ernest Mario can testify
that executive pay in Europe indeed is beginning to catch up
with that in the U.S., if in an uneven and unequal way. Mr.
Mario, who works for Glaxo Holdings PLC, the U.K.'s top
pharmaceuticals maker, last year moved to Britain as chief
executive from a managing director's spot in the U.S. He got
a 30% salary increase to nearly $1 million, pay that puts him
on a par with the chieftains of similarly sized companies in
the U.S.
   Driven by the increasing globalization of business and the
need to attract scarce managerial talent, executives'
earnings across Europe "are moving ahead much more quickly
than those of their peers in the U.S," says Ron Amy, group
compensation and benefits director at Grand Metropolitan PLC,
the British food and drinks group. "We are seeing a closing
of the gap." Another reason for the upward movement: tax
reforms that allow executives to keep more of their earnings.
   After adjustment to reflect net purchasing power, a
typical European executive now earns 75% as much as a U.S.
counterpart -- up from 70% in 1985, estimates Hay Group Inc.
Performance bonuses and even stock options are becoming far
more common, too, says Hay.
   But does all of this spell true parity with the U.S.
before too long? Don't count on it.
   The gap between U.S.and European executive compensation
may never close completely. In some parts of the European
patchwork quilt, salaries are so far behind American pay that
catching up seems well-nigh impossible. Senior executives in
wealthy Switzerland come closest to Americans in gross salary
and bonus levels, and someday could match them. But those in
less affluent nations such as Portugal and Ireland are far,
far off the pace.
   Also, there are still too many lingering differences in
Old World attitudes, values, tax systems and living
standards. Nonmonetary rewards -- from a deluxe company car
to better job security -- still motivate many European
managers as much as cold cash. And in a part of the world
where socialist tradition still runs deep, those who make a
whopping U.S.-style income risk public scorn as greedy fat
cats. "To a lot of people, {high pay} sounds obscene," says
Noel de Berry, an executive recruiter in London's financial
district.
   Banker Christopher Heath discovered this when his earnings
of 2.5 million, largely profit-related, made him Britain's
highest-paid executive for 1986. The outraged tabloid press
hounded Mr. Heath, forcing him to disappear for a week and
prompting his employer, Baring Brothers &amp; Co., to hire guards
for his home.
   Across the Channel, a satirical French newspaper stirred a
lot of fresh antagonism into a labor dispute last fall when
it reported that Peugeot SA, the French auto maker, had paid
Chairman Jacques Calvet a little more than $340,000 in 1988.
Though Chrysler chief executive Lee Iacocca earned the same
in a little over a month, including stock options, Mr.
Calvet's salary increases -- 24% in 1988 and 17% the year
before -- infuriated striking Peugeot workers. They had
walked out over management's refusal to grant them more than
a 4.4% annual raise.
   This sort of reaction leaves many European companies still
wary about handing out big salaries and performance bonuses.
Two-thirds of major European businesses do offer such bonuses
now, compared with 87% in the U.S., and the number has grown
rapidly -- but the bonuses often are not as lavish, or spread
among as many potential recipients, as they are in the U.S.
   Peugeot, for one, limits them to only a few top
executives. French companies generally would like to extend
performance-based pay to a wider management group, says
Peugeot spokesman Martin Alloiteau. But after 40 years of
government with a wide streak of social welfarism, "it's too
early in France right now," he adds. "It means a deep change
in mentality."
   Similarly, although stock options are gaining ground in
Europe, they may not approach their popularity in the U.S.
for many years, if ever. According to a recent poll by Wyatt
Co., a U.S. consulting firm, they are now offered by at least
25% of the companies in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the U.K. But they are still
far less prevalent than in the U.S., and in some European
countries with few publicly held businesses and
less-developed equity markets, rapid growth in their use
seems unlikely.
   Also, where they are offered, such options frequently are
less generous than in the U.S., are limited to a smaller
number of executives, and sometimes are tied to how well the
company performs. In Britain, institutional shareholders
employ guidelines limiting executives' share options to four
times their yearly compensation unless they achieve strict,
stipulated levels of performance. Such restrictions don't
exist in the U.S.
   As much as any single factor, the narrower scope and scale
of stock options leaves Europe still a long way from parity
with the U.S. by the most meaningful yardstick -- total
renumeration. This includes not only salary, bonuses and
benefits but also the value of stock options.
   By this standard the chief executive of an American
company with sales of $250 million a year received an average
of $543,000 as of January 1989, says Towers Perrin, a
U.S.-based benefits consulting firm. A CEO of a similar Swiss
business earned $307,000, but the head of the same-sized
British, German or French company garnered only about half
the U.S. figure.
   However, what European corporations lack in lavish pay
packages they often make up for in generous perks. Among
them: company-subsidized yachts, country estates, gardeners,
chauffeurs, home entertainment and personal phone bills. U.K.
businesses introduced company cars in the mid-1970s and at
one point even paid for business suits.
   The suit perk is gone, but the cars are everywhere. Over
90% of senior British managers now get company cars -- more
than in the U.S. or anywhere else. It's proof of how highly
conscious Britons remain of accent, dress and other marks of
class. Some executives even take pay cuts to join businesses
offering fancier sets of wheels.
   European managers also get longer vacations than their
U.S. counterparts -- six weeks isn't unusual -- and while
Americans brag about how rarely they take time off, Britons
and Continentals make a point of taking their vacations. (Sir
John Egan, then Jaguar PLC's chairman, took a one-week
holiday to Barbados last October right in the middle of talks
with General Motors Corp. about a minority linkup. A source
close to GM says his departure "raised a few eyebrows" among
GM officials left cooling their heels. Ford Motor Co. wound
up buying Jaguar.)
   In addition, European executives usually have more job
security and richer pension benefits than their American
peers, and assign a high value to both. One London investment
banker with a six-figure income rejected a U.S. bank's
higher-paying offer last year because he worried he might be
out of a job in nine months. "People in the U.K.," he notes,
"work for things other than money."
   He might have added that he who stays put also has a
better chance of getting ahead in Europe. Despite all the
executive-suite chatter about meritocracy and pay for
performance, employers in Europe still value long service
more than American bosses do when promotions are made. "A lot
of recruitment is done within the old boys' network," says
Jean Van den Eynde, a Brussels-based executive recruiter.
"Even when they {European companies} don't have the ideal
person around, they will tend to promote from within and hope
that it works out."
   This is one manifestation of a lingering elitism that
still influences who gets ahead in Europe. American and
Japanese competition has diminished the importance of the
right accent, education and family ties -- but it has by no
means eliminated it, particularly in finance.
   Last fall, a French executive quit Caisse des Depots et
Consignations, a big state-owned investment house, after
realizing he would never reach upper management because he
hadn't attended an elite French university. "In the U.S., you
judge people on what they have done, which is not quite true
in Europe," the disillusioned Frenchman says. "Here, they are
more judged on what they look like and what kind of schools
they come from."
