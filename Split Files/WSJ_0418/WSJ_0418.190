   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co. reported a 31% drop in
first-quarter profit, but company officials told the annual
meeting that the outlook is brighter for the rest of the
year.
   The producer of bearings and specialty steels earned $19.1
million, or 63 cents a share, for the quarter, down from
$27.7 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
declined 6%, to $408.5 million, from $434.7 million.

   Profit in the first quarter was reduced by the sluggish
economy and lower steel prices, Chairman W.R. Timken Jr. told
the annual meeting. He said profit was also lessened by
lingering effects of a strike in the 1989 fourth quarter that
caused some customers to temporarily seek alternate
suppliers.
   The company has "good momentum" going into the second
quarter, however, and expects higher profits for the full
year, he said, declining to make a specific projection.
   In 1989, Timken earned $55.3 million, or $1.88 a share,
all in the first half. The business slowdown, combined with
the fourth-quarter strike, resulted in a loss in the final
period that exceeded the modest third period profit.
   Timken's bearings business is strong in most parts of the
world, and prices are higher than a year ago, Joseph F. Toot
Jr., president, said. "Steel demand is reasonable, but
pricing is low, because there's a lot of excess capacity,
particularly in bar steel," a major Timken product.
   The company is on schedule with a $1 billion capital
spending program extending through 1994, Mr. Toot said. Many
of the major additions and plant improvements included in
that plan will be described later this year, he said, after
detailed plans are finished and negotiations with plant-site
communities completed.
