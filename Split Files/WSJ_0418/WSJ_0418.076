   We see where Rolling Stone magazine has decided to list us
among the people and places it deems insufficiently ardent in
promoting its views of environmental propriety. Also on
Rolling Stone's list are former President of the United
States Ronald Reagan, current American President George Bush,
the entire nation of Japan and Kenny Rogers. We seem to merit
inclusion on this august list for once editorializing that
the California Green movement was made up of "lala
activists."
   Sometime in the coming week, many of the musicians who
have made Rolling Stone magazine succeed will participate in
a TV program to promote Earth Day. Insofar as at least 13
states have been threatening lately to enact legislation
aimed at pornographic rock-music lyrics, it is encouraging to
see that so many musicians have decided to channel their
natural energies into helping the land, the air, the seas,
the animals of the earth and people. It occurs to us, though,
that while these artists and Rolling Stone are condemning
Presidents, nations, corporations and even editorial pages
for not sharing their views, perhaps they should think about
the weeds in their own garden.

   Now that investment banking has been knocked out of the
box, the music industry is the only place left where people
in their twenties can become millionaires. But look at the
cost of their fortunes. How long will it take for a compact
disc to biodegrade? They advertise the shiny metal discs as
being virtually indestructible. Day after day, music-company
factories are stamping out thousands upon thousands of CDs.
Heaven knows how much land is being pillaged to mine out
metals for these CDs. Are they recyclable; can you use them
as mulch? Compounding the threat, many CDs are sold in
hard-plastic packaging.
   How about cassette tapes? There's something that isn't
going to biodegrade any time soon. And boy is there a lot of
it. Take all the cassette tapes ever made, splice them
together, and you probably could string that little brown
tape out to the Moon, wrap it twice, and tether it to a tree
in the rain forest. The most expensive tapes are coated with
chromium dioxide, which sounds like one of those things
that's going to leak out of landfills and into the ground
water.
   Then there's the biggest music-pollution problem of all --
the world glut of vinyl LPs. Many are being duplicated as
redundant CDs. There must be more non-biodegradable LPs in
America than there are trees in Yellowstone National Park.
Even after the original Earth Day, Rolling Stone magazine
used to advertise them in every single issue. Didn't anyone
wonder what would happen when the fans turned 40 and started
sending their Deep Purple and Jefferson Starship albums to
the nation's landfills? And we're supposed to worry about
McDonald's polystyrene boxes. Did you ever try to melt an LP?
   It will be said many times this week that we are all in
this together. However, the nation's celebrities will say it
more than everyone else. We guess that's because they have
more free time than everyone else. But in the days ahead,
when they are berating the people of America for not doing
enough for the Amazon, global temperatures and trash
recycling, we will wonder about that unending output of metal
CDs and plastic LPs, their own for-profit contribution to the
ecosystem.
