   AmeriFirst Bank, Miami, said a federal judge approved its
$4.5 million settlement of four shareholder lawsuits against
it.
   The thrift said members of the class action have until
June 1 to submit a claim to share in the settlement, which
results from suits alleging it misled shareholders about its
financial condition in public filings.

   As previously reported, AmeriFirst agreed to pay its
shareholders $4.5 million, of which $2 million was placed in
escrow in February. The balance is due within 30 months.
   The company said the settlement was an essential first
step toward its objective of raising new capital to meet
regulatory requirements.
   Meanwhile, AmeriFirst said it is continuing to press its
own suit against certain former top managers and outside
auditors, claiming that lending and auditing practices led to
the company's current financial woes. Under the settlement,
the thrift will share part of any funds recovered from the
suit with the shareholder class members who purchased the
bank's stock from November 1986 through December 1989.
