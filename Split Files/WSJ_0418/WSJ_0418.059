   Without malicious intent, you erred in describing the
annual survey of Consumer Reports subscribers, upon which our
automobile Frequency-of-Repair records are based, by saying
"it isn't scientific" ("Big Three Boost Car Quality but Still
Lag," March 27). To the contrary, our survey techniques and
data analyses are highly sophisticated and thoroughly
scrutinized by experts inside and outside Consumers Union.
Our data and the published findings are as accurate and
objective as is scientifically possible in representing the
experiences of our 4.5 million subscribers. This is CU's
hallmark, and one we take great pride in.
   You also asserted that CU's data showed that six out of
seven GM owners responding to our survey are unwilling to buy
the same model again. Nothing in our magazine comes even
close to such a conclusion.
