   LONDON -- British &amp; Commonwealth PLC, a financial services
concern, said it will begin a #750 million ($1.22 billion)
asset sale following the discovery of severe troubles at
Atlantic Computers PLC, its computer leasing subsidiary.
   Peter Thompson, non-executive chairman of B&amp;C, said the
sales would leave a core business that is "cash-producing as
opposed to cash-demanding," with money brokering its central
theme.

   Mr. Thompson made his comments at a news conference
following an announcement that B&amp;C would write off its #550
million investment in Atlantic and put the subsidiary in the
hands of an administrator.
   The executive said B&amp;C will seek buyers for many of its
main subsidiaries, including its merchant banking group. But
he said a decision on which other divisions are to be sold
hasn't been made.
   Mr. Thompson said proceeds from the sales will be used to
reduce the company's debt to about #250 million from #1
billion.
   B&amp;C currently consists of five main divisions, apart from
its computer leasing business: money brokering, merchant
banking, fund management, professional services, and property
and investments.
   Mr. Thompson said Atlantic's problems only became clear
"in the last few days" as a result of three parallel studies
of B&amp;C's businesses. One of the reviews indicated that
Atlantic's assets and profits were "materially overstated,"
B&amp;C said.
   John Gunn, B&amp;C group chief executive, said prior to the
studies Atlantic had been expected to show a 1989 pretax
profit of #20 million to #40 million. It now expects Atlantic
to show a "substantial loss."
   Mr. Thompson said Atlantic was operating in an environment
where its margins were being cut by increasingly severe
competition and technological breakthroughs which rendered
its leased equipment obsolete more rapidly than the company
had anticipated.
   B&amp;C appointed Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm,
administrator to Atlantic. B&amp;C officials said the decision to
appoint an administrator provides the company extra
flexibility in handling Atlantic's removal from B&amp;C.
