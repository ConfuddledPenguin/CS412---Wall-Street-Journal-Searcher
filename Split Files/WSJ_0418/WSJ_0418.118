   EAC Industries Inc. said it will report a loss of about
$12.5 million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 due to
"significant problems" at the company and its Ideal Security
Hardware subsidiary.
   A year earlier, the Chicago-based maker of hardware and
printing supplies had a loss of $1.7 million on sales of
$31.5 million.

   The company said the loss resulted mainly from the
write-off of intangible assets, such as $5.5 million in
relocation costs for the recent move of Ideal Security to
Johnson City, Tenn., from St. Paul, Minn., as well as the
write-off of $1.2 million of good will.
   EAC also cited fourth-quarter accounting and audit
adjustments at Ideal Security of $2.3 million.
   It further attributed the loss to disruptions at Ideal
Security resulting from the recent move, legal and consulting
fees related to attempts to sell EAC or its subsidiaries, and
provisions for losses from discontinued operations.
   In spite of the loss, EAC said its other subsidiary,
Goodren Products Corp., continues to generate profits in
excess of expectations.
