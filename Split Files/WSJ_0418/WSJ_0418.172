   The two auto companies have long had joint operating
agreements, involving the development of cars in the U.K. and
the marketing of Rover models in Japan.
   Rover's equity participation in Honda U.K. comes as part
of a plan to increase the local Honda unit's capitalization
to #370 million by 1993 from #60 million currently. Rover
will take 20% of the enlarged equity.
   Honda U.K. is scheduled to begin production of 100,000
cars a year at a plant in Swindon by late 1992. The plant is
to produce two versions of the same model to be sold
separately through Honda and Rover dealerships.
