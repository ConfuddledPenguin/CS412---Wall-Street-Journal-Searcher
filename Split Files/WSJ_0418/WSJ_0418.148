   CLEVELAND -- AmeriTrust Corp. said it has delayed the
release of its first-quarter earnings while federal bank
examiners review its loan portfolio.
   The bank, which had planned to release earnings tomorrow,
said it wanted to wait until regulators have completed their
review in case loan-loss provisions must be increased.
AmeriTrust said examiners haven't indicated that the firm's
loan-loss reserves will need to be increased.

   Amid mounting concerns over asset quality, examiners from
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have been
applying tougher lending criteria to banks throughout the
country, forcing some banks to increase loan-loss provisions.
