   Rising inflation pummeled bond prices, but blue-chip
stocks managed to post modest gains. The dollar was mixed.
   Long-term bond prices lost nearly a full point, or about
$10 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue climbed to 8.72%, the
highest level in nearly a year.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.71 points to
2765.77 in thin trading. But broader market measures posted
slight declines, and for the second straight day there were
more decliners than gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bond investors were shaken early in the day by a
government report that showed consumer prices in March rose
0.5%, or more than 6% annually. And if the volatile food and
energy segments are excluded, the so-called core rate of
inflation in March was an even worse 0.7%, or about 8.4%
annually. Economists had expected consumer prices for the
month to rise only about 0.2%, or 2.4% annually.
   Analysts said the report increases the possibility that
the Federal Reserve might soon push short-term interest rates
higher in a bid to choke off worsening inflation. So far this
year consumer prices have risen at an annualized rate of
8.5%, the largest first-quarter increase since a 10.6% rise
in the first three months of 1981.
   But analysts also noted that March's big rise in consumer
prices contrasts with last week's report of a 0.2% decline in
producer prices, a measure of inflation at the wholesale
level. Some analysts suggest that producer prices are a more
accurate gauge of future inflation trends.
   Other government reports yesterday presented a mixed
picture of economic activity that offered little guidance to
investors. Housing starts were off 9.3% in March, reflecting
a deteriorating real estate market in many areas of the
nation. But industrial production and factory utilization
rose in March, signaling that the economy's industrial sector
is stabilizing or even rebounding somewhat.
   The rapid deterioration in the bond market pulled stock
prices sharply lower in early trading. At one point the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was down 21 points. Prices began a
slow but steady recovery in midmorning, and by late afternoon
the industrial average eased into positive territory. But
trading was light, and analysts said prices remain vulnerable
to disappointing earnings reports and a further bond market
retreat.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices tumbled. The 30-year Treasury bond lost nearly
a full point, or about $10 for each $1,000 of face amount.
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices were mixed in thin trading. Volume on the Big
Board totaled 128 million shares, as declining issues were
ahead of gainers 844 to 662.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6768 marks and 159.68 yen, compared
with 1.6775 marks and 159.30 yen Monday.
