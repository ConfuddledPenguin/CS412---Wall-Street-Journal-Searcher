   Shares of Michael Foods Inc. were hit by a wave of selling
after the disclosure that the company's controlling
shareholder had pledged the stock as loan collateral.
   Michael was formed in 1987 by North Star Universal Inc., a
publicly traded food company that holds 53.9% of Michael's
common shares. North Star recently defaulted on a $31 million
credit line from First National Bank of Minneapolis, and as
part of the line's revised terms, the bank asked for the
Michael stake as security. The bank is asking that the stock
be worth at least twice the value of its loan. Initially,
that would require a share price of about $11.32 for Michael,
a Minneapolis food products concern. Presumably, if the stock
fell below that, the bank could take control of the block.
First Minneapolis declined to comment on the loan.

   As news of the loan reached Wall Street yesterday, Michael
stock fell 87.5 cents to $12.875, as 562,900 shares changed
hands. North Star dropped 75 cents to $4.25, a 52-week low.
Both stocks trade in the national over-the-counter market.
