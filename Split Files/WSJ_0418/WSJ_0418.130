   NEW YORK -- PaineWebber Group Inc.'s first-quarter
earnings rose 17%, but the gain didn't brighten analysts'
outlook for the brokerage industry.
   Despite the improved results reported by PaineWebber --
and on Monday by Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co. unit -- "it's still a poor quarter" for Wall Street,
said Lawrence Eckenfelder, analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "You're still talking about very depressed
numbers here."

   Donald B. Marron, PaineWebber's chairman, agreed in an
interview that the company's improved results must be viewed
in the context of Wall Street's condition. "Clearly there is
more to do" to improve earnings, Mr. Marron said. "The
business is improved in most of the areas, but that's in a
climate where things are very, very quiet."
   Most big brokerage firms are expected to post flat
results, except for American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., which today is expected to announce a record
loss reflecting the costs of a restructuring effort.
   PaineWebber said its net income for the first quarter was
$10.8 million, on revenue of $426 million, compared with net
income of $9.2 million on revenue of nearly $397 million in
the year-earlier quarter.
   Alison Deans, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said
PaineWebber's performance was "actually a little better than
I would have expected in this environment."
   PaineWebber's brokers have improved productivity, analysts
said, and the firm continues to gather customer assets --
increasing to more than $67.1 billion as of March 31 from $54
billion the year earlier. But takeover-speculation losses
sustained by PaineWebber's risk arbitrage department, and the
continued weak investment-banking climate, "adversely
impacted" first-quarter results, PaineWebber said.
   PaineWebber is one of the brokerage firms still holding a
temporary "bridge" loan to Campeau Corp., owner of the
Federated and Allied department-store companies that are in
bankruptcy-law proceedings. PaineWebber in December wrote off
about $20 million of its $90 million loan, analysts and
industry officials say. But it took no additional charge in
the first quarter, apparently indicating that PaineWebber
doesn't think it will face further losses. Mr. Marron
declined to comment, because PaineWebber hasn't publicly
confirmed how much of the loan it has written off.
   Also, PaineWebber denied industry speculation, reported in
the newsletter Securities Week, that it's considering an
acquisition of Stifel Financial Corp.'s Stifel, Nicolaus &amp;
Co., a regional brokerage firm in St. Louis.
   The speculation is "absolutely untrue," a PaineWebber
official said. In St. Louis, a Stifel Nicolaus spokesman said
the speculation is "totally unfounded, and no such
discussions have taken place." However, the spokesman said
his firm had recently negotiated a deal with PaineWebber in
which PaineWebber would execute certain Stifel Nicolaus
trades.
