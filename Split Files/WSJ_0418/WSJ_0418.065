   DETROIT -- Maryland inventor Robert W. Kearns, who in
January convinced a federal court jury here that Ford Motor
Co. violated his patents for an electronic, intermittent
windshield wiper system, now wants the same jury to shake
Detroit's tradition of buying ideas on the cheap.
   In arguments that kicked off the penalty phase of the
Kearns trial, Ford lawyer Malcolm Wheeler said a "reasonable"
royalty for Mr. Kearns's wiper system should be no more than
five cents or 10 cents a car, with a maximum of $1.5 million
-- in line with standard auto industry practice. Ford paid no
more to license such critical inventions as the automatic
choke, Mr. Wheeler said.

   But Paul Janicke, lead trial counsel for Mr. Kearns, told
the jury not to follow normal auto industry practice in
deciding his client's award. Auto companies "do things to
inventors, not for inventors," he said. Instead, Mr. Janicke
said Ford should pay Mr. Kearns a percentage of the revenue
it received from sales of the wiper systems.
   Mr. Janicke offered two methods for calculating a royalty
rate. One came to 25%, the other 42%. Spread over the 20.5
million wiper systems Ford sold from 1971 to 1988, the 25%
royalty would yield about $193 million, and the 42% royalty
would produce $325 million.
   The trial is expected to last two weeks.
