   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co., citing strong
earnings improvements at most of its major businesses, posted
a 12% gain in first-quarter profit to $950 million, or $1.06
a share, on a 5.9% revenue increase.
   But GE said its National Broadcasting Co. unit had
"somewhat" lower revenue and earnings, and its materials unit
did poorly.

   In the year-earlier period, GE earned $849 million, or 94
cents a share. Revenue rose to $12.6 billion from $11.9
billion.
   The results, which some analysts said were in line with
their expectations, reflected improved operating margins from
productivity gains. Operating margin was a record for the
first quarter at 11.8% of sales, up from last year's 10.7%.
   Among the businesses with strong earnings improvements, GE
said, were GE Capital; Power Systems and Aircraft Engines;
Lighting; Medical Systems; Electrical Distribution and
Controls; and Transportation Systems.
   The company said that both the Aerospace and Appliances
units' operating profits were about the same as last year.
Operating profit for its materials business, which is mostly
composed of GE Plastics, was "considerably" below a year
earlier because of slowed demand in automotive, appliance and
housing markets.
   GE said that new orders in the first quarter continued the
pattern of 1989 with "substantial strength in bookings for
longer-cycle businesses." New orders for the Power Generation
unit were up 60% from the 1989 first quarter. The Medical
Systems unit's new orders were ahead 25%.
   GE said that orders for its "short-cycle" businesses,
which include GE Lighting, Plastics and Appliances, began to
show improvement in March from their flat levels earlier in
the first quarter. These businesses are affected by auto and
housing markets.
   David Gardner, an analyst who follows GE at Nomura
Research Institute, said GE's plastics business will benefit
in the second quarter from Detroit's planned 20% increase in
auto production this quarter. "But the housing market remains
uncertain, and the appliance business may take (until the)
third or fourth quarter before it starts to show any
strength," he said.
   The company noted that growth in pershare earnings
exceeded the percentage increase in net income because of
shares purchased under a previously announced buy-back plan.
GE bought back 11.6 million common shares at a total cost of
$728 million during the first quarter, bringing the average
number of shares outstanding to 899 million shares. GE said
it has so far bought back 15.3 million shares, at a cost of
$963 million.
