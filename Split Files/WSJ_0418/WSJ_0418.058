   Walt Disney Co. executives recently got some alarming
news: A woman who had been recruited for a hush-hush research
screening for a rough cut of "Dick Tracy" had called a Los
Angeles radio station to blab her opinion. They scurried to
get a transcript of the broadcast, knowing that word of mouth
could help make or break the film in the crucial summer movie
season that starts heating up next month.
   They needn't have worried. "Oh, it was absolutely
incredible," gushed the caller, who identified herself as
Joanne. "It is as if the comic strip would come to life and
all your imagination came true."

   Joanne's opinion doesn't necessarily guarantee a hit, but
every little bit helps. "Dick Tracy," scheduled for release
June 15, will be fighting for attention with about a dozen
other high-profile, big-budget films, including the usual
plethora of sequels, action films and comedies. Among the
other leading box-office contenders: "Back to the Future
III," "Days of Thunder" and "Gremlins II."
   Right now, studios are rushing to finish their movies and
playing a frantic game of musical chairs, juggling and
rejuggling their release schedules in an attempt to avoid
head-to-head conflicts at the box office. "June is going to
be a disaster for somebody," predicts Dennis McAlpine, an
analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "There could be a lot of big
openings that will die fast because there will be so many
alternatives." And with so many big-budget films, he says, it
will be hard for some studios to make a profit even if their
movies do strong business at the box office.
   Moreover, the summer films may be competing with spring
holdovers. In contrast to past years, when the spring months
were typically arid for moviegoers, a half-dozen current
movies are racking up big ticket sales, including the
surprise smash "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" from New Line
Cinema Corp., Paramount Pictures Corp.'s "Hunt for Red
October," Walt Disney's "Pretty Woman" and the Warner Bros.
and Zanuck Co. best picture Oscar winner, "Driving Miss
Daisy."
   "Right now, we're looking at four movies with the
potential to do $100 million or more between January and
April, and that's an unheard-of phenomenon," says Barry
London, Paramount's motion picture group president in charge
of distribution. But Mr. London says the current crop of hits
will just whet moviegoers' appetites for new summer films.
"Business has never been better, and that sets up the summer
very well," he says.
   A.D. Murphy, who tracks box-office results for Variety,
notes that total box-office revenues so far this year are
$100 million ahead of last year. But Mr. Murphy adds that
last summer will be hard to beat. Because of the blockbuster
"Batman," which took in $251.1 million, and other big hits
such as "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Lethal
Weapon II," box-office revenues last year rose 18% to $2
billion. "The pictures last year were awesome, and it will be
nothing short of a miracle if we can pass last summer," says
Sumner Redstone, chairman of the theater chain National
Amusements Inc.
   Mr. Redstone and other theater owners say "Dick Tracy" is
one of the most eagerly awaited summer films in the industry.
More than a decade in the making, it stars aging heartthrob
Warren Beatty and rock star Madonna. Because it is based on
the comic-strip character, it is drawing inevitable
comparisons to "Batman" -- whose success Disney clearly hopes
it will emulate. Licensees likewise are hoping for a bonanza
in merchandise featuring Dick Tracy's distinctive profile.
   Disney has a half-dozen other movies due for release this
summer, including two animated films, "Ducktales" and a
re-release of "The Jungle Book." It is also releasing the
first pictures produced by its new Hollywood Pictures unit:
"Arachnaphobia" and "Taking Care of Business." But the
company has the most riding on "Dick Tracy." The movie's
success or failure "will be a big event for the Disney
stock," says Mara Balsbaugh, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Ms. Balsbaugh and other analysts say Paramount Pictures'
summer lineup, packed with big-budget films, has the
potential to generate some of the biggest hits. The studio's
first big summer release, "Another 48 Hours," is a sequel to
the Eddie Murphy-Nick Nolte buddy movie that was a big hit in
1982. The Paramount Communications Inc. unit originally
planned to release the movie on June 27, but moved it up to
June 8 to get the jump on three other high-profile action
films due for mid-June release: "Die Hard II," News Corp.'s
20th Century Fox Film Co. unit's sequel to the Bruce Willis
hit, scheduled to open June 22; Tri-Star Pictures Inc.'s
"Total Recall," which stars muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger,
and Orion Pictures Corp.'s sequel "Robocop 2."
   The Paramount movie originally scheduled to open June 8,
"Days of Thunder," will now be released on June 27, a date it
has to itself, at least for now. That film, the first to be
produced in several years by "Beverly Hills Cop II" and "Top
Gun" producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, stars Tom
Cruise as a race-car driver; industry executives describe it
as "`Top Gun' goes to the race track." The producers are
still racing to finish the film. And in an unusual move,
Paramount is considering releasing "Days of Thunder" in Japan
a few days after its U.S. release to generate added publicity
-- and quicker revenue -- there. Typically, studios wait
months before releasing movies overseas.
   Phil Garfinkle, executive vice president of Entertainment
Data Inc., which tracks box-office data, notes that there are
close to 50 films scheduled for wide release this summer, up
from 41 last summer. The reshuffling of release dates, he
predicts, may last right up to the start of the season.
"There's so much at stake that everyone is looking for
someone else to set the schedule so they can react or
anticipate the reactions of others," he says.
   As usual, the summer has its complement of sequels,
starting with "Gremlins II" on May 18 from Time Warner Inc.'s
Warner Bros. unit and "Back to The Future III" from MCA
Inc.'s Universal Studios on May 25, Memorial Day weekend.
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which
compiles box-office data, says theater owners he polls expect
those two movies to start the summer off with a blast because
of their appeal to both younger audiences and adults. Also on
the sequel front are "Young Guns II" and "Exorcist III" from
20th Century Fox Film. Sixteen years after "Chinatown,"
Paramount finally is releasing a sequel, "The Two Jakes,"
with Jack Nicholson reprising his role as a private eye.
   Despite the easing of East-West tension, Paramount's
success with "The Hunt for Red October" indicates there's
still a market for war movies. At least the studio hopes so;
in July, it will release "Flight of the Intruder," a Vietnam
War movie about fighter pilots. Orion Pictures hopes to cash
in on the wave as well with "Navy SEALS," starring Charlie
Sheen.
   A number of comedies are in the lineup, though industry
officials say they aren't sure which, if any, will become a
big comedy hit. Orion starts off the comedy race May 18 with
"Cadillac Man," featuring Robin Williams, and Fox is
releasing "Ford Fairlane" with raunchy comedian Andrew Dice
Clay in early July. Warner is betting heavily on comedy for
three of its seven films this summer: "Quick Change,"
starring Bill Murray; "My Blue Heaven," with Steve Martin and
Rick Moranis; and "Dive," with Ned Beatty and Robert Vaughan.
Universal, obviously hoping Bill Cosby's next movie will
perform better than his last (the Columbia Pictures flop
"Leonard Part VI") is releasing his movie "Ghost Dad" in
July.
   Some studios that have been poor performers recently, such
as Orion and Fox, look much better positioned this summer,
while other studios -- notably Columbia Pictures and MGM/UA
Entertainment Co., which both recently changed hands, are
barely in the race. New management at Columbia, now a unit of
Sony Corp., says it didn't find much in the larder. Though
Columbia's Tri-Star unit has three films for release --
including "Total Recall" and "Air America" from its
distribution arrangement with Carolco Pictures Inc. -- the
Columbia Pictures unit has just one: "Flatliners," starring
Kiefer Sutherland and Julia Roberts. Hoping to eke out some
kiddie business, the studio is re-releasing last year's "The
Adventures of Milo &amp; Otis."
