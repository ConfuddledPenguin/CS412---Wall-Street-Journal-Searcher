   American Home Products Corp. said net income rose 12% to
$314.5 million in the first quarter, or $2.01 a share, from
year-earlier net of $280.1 million, or $1.81 a share. Sales
rose 3.8% to $1.81 billion from $1.75 billion.

Products unit increased 3% in the quarter, while its Food &amp;
Household Products unit posted an 8% rise in sales from a
year earlier.

   Net was also helped by a lower tax rate resulting from the
company's merger in 1989 with A.H. Robins Co. and use of its
tax-loss carry-forwards related to the funding of the Dalkon
Shield Trusts. In the quarter, federal and foreign taxes fell
20% to $104 million.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Home rose 62.5 cents to close at $104 a share.
