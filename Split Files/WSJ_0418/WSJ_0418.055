   Three California thrift giants reported robust
first-quarter earnings driven by a healthy state housing
market and widening net interest margins, at a time when the
margins of most big commercial banks are declining.
   The margins of H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., Los Angeles; Great
Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills; and Golden West
Financial Corp., Oakland, rose partly because of an improved
spread between deposit costs and the adjustable-rate mortgage
index used in California. The big thrifts clearly benefited
from less deposit and loan competition from desperate savings
and loan associations shut down by regulators since passage
of the thrift-rescue legislation in August 1989. This trend
is helping boost earnings of many of the approximately 1,500
thrifts that are well-capitalized and profitable, an
often-overlooked group.

   Great Western, for instance, reported that its net
interest margin -- the difference between its cost of funds
and its yield on assets -- jumped to 3.01% from 2.43% a year
ago, contributing to a $55.8 million rise in net interest
income. Golden West's margin rose to 2.51% from 2.32%, and
Ahmanson's rose to 2.68% from 2.41%.
   In contrast, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., a California competitor
and one of the best-run commercial banks in the U.S.,
yesterday reported that its net interest margin fell to 5.09%
from 5.23%, a typical performance for commercial banks,
mainly because deposit costs a year ago lagged behind
increases in the commercial banks' prime rate.
   The much-feared collapse in the California real-estate
market clearly has failed to materialize. Ahmanson's mortgage
originations jumped 12% to a first-quarter record of $3.4
billion, up from $3 billion in the 1989 first quarter. Great
Western generated $2.9 billion in new loans, down 19% from a
year ago but still robust. Golden West reported the biggest
decline in new loans, a 40% drop to $845 million.
   Each of the big thrifts reported sharp gains in deposits,
with Ahmanson showing a 12% gain from a year ago, Great
Western 9%, and Golden West 14%. Golden West's deposit growth
in the period was twice the rate recorded in the year-ago
period.
   "Our savings volume has benefited from the decreased
competition for funds from troubled thrifts no longer allowed
to grow by the regulators," said Herbert M. Sandler, Golden
West's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Golden West's provision for loan losses remained minuscule
at $3 million, compared with $3.3 million a year ago. Great
Western's $20 million provision was slightly below the
year-ago level. But Ahmanson's provision doubled in size to
$25.2 million, reflecting a $41 million increase in
non-performing assets since the end of 1989.
   Analysts expect the three thrifts to report full-year
earnings about 25% to 35% above their 1989 net income,
excluding asset write-downs. But their stocks continue to
trade at six to eight times expected 1990 earnings, compared
with an average multiple of nearly 15 for most stocks.
   "It's an outrage," said Mr. Sandler. "We've recorded a 20%
yearly compounded growth rate in earnings over the last 20
years. No other bank or S&amp;L comes close to that."
   "The stock prices are clearly discounting {expecting} an
earnings decline this year," said Joseph Jolson, a thrift
analyst for Montgomery Securities, San Francisco. "Investors
are focused on the California real-estate market and expect
home prices to decline. Sooner or later they'll wise up to
the fact that there has been a soft landing for California
home prices, and that there hasn't been the debacle everyone
has been talking about."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ahmanson closed at $17.125, unchanged. Great Western rose
12.5 cents to $16.50 while Golden West closed at $27, up 50
cents.
