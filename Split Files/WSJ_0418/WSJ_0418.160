   Whitehall Corp. said its directors rejected a $20-a-share,
or $62 million, offer from Cambridge Capital Fund Limited
Partnership, saying the offer was conditional, inadequate and
not in the best interests of stockholders.
   Whitehall, a Dallas-based aircraft maintenance and defense
concern, said its board believes the offer is "untimely"
relative to its efforts to move into the commercial aircraft
maintenance business and to apply its underwater systems
developed for the oil and gas industry to the U.S. Navy's
needs. It also said it believes the price is too low,
considering its business prospects and its asset value.

   Cambridge, a New York investment partnership, offered
earlier this month to acquire the 90.4% of Whitehall it
doesn't already own. It also plans to nominate its slate of
five directors at Whitehall's annual meeting April 23.
   In New York, a Cambridge spokesman said the group is
disappointed in Whitehall's refusal to talk about a proposal,
and now will focus its efforts on winning seats on
Whitehall's board.
