   Lithuanians braced themselves for drastic cuts in supplies
of oil and natural gas after Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev appeared to be following through on his threat of
economic sanctions against the republic.
   Lithuanian officials reported receiving a telegram
yesterday from the general-director of one of the Soviet
Union's gas-supply organizations informing them that the
supply of natural gas is being sharply reduced. They also
reported that the Mazeikiai oil refinery in northwest
Lithuania received a telephone call saying petroleum supplies
would be cut off completely early today.

   But much confusion remained. Soviet officials in Moscow
made no announcement of a blockade. And the official who sent
the telegram told Reuters news agency that it was intended as
a warning and that gas was still flowing normally to the
republic for the time being.
   "We are waiting to see what will happen tomorrow," said a
spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Supreme Council. "There are
many rumors now." A spokesman for Sajudis, the nationalist
movement that has taken over government in the republic,
said, "There's no panic, but of course people are worried."
He said people have been waiting in line for hours at gas
stations throughout the republic.
   The U.S. is preparing to hold up some dealings with the
Soviet Union, including economic talks, if Soviet officials
actually slash Lithuania's energy supplies.
   But such retaliation against Moscow would be taken
reluctantly and would only affect the least important aspects
of the U.S.-Soviet relationship, at least initially.
   Bush administration officials said the U.S. would respond
only if it determines that the supply cutbacks actually occur
and are significant in scope. They also said the
administration hadn't decided exactly what retaliatory steps
would be taken.
   What's more, the administration expects to launch an
effort, possibly as early as today, to persuade Congress and
the public that some key aspects of warmer U.S.-Soviet
relations are so advantageous to U.S. interests that they
shouldn't be sacrificed to protest Moscow's actions in
Lithuania.
   This campaign will stress the importance of four pending
arms control deals, talks on German unity, and the planned
May 30 U.S.-Soviet summit. It could be unveiled by Secretary
of State James Baker in congressional testimony scheduled for
today.
   U.S. officials privately ruled out any effort to send U.S.
fuel or other supplies to Lithuania, saying it would be
logistically impractical and politically inflammatory.
   Nevertheless, even minor retaliation by the U.S. would be
an important escalation in U.S. policy on the Lithuania
crisis. Up to now, the administration has repeatedly
counseled calm and sought to avoid threatening Moscow.
President Bush personally raised the stakes. Reacting to news
stories and intelligence reports of impending cutoffs of
natural gas and oil, the president said, "Clearly those
announcements are contrary to the approach that we have urged
and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union." He added:
"We are considering appropriate responses if these threats
are implemented."
   Meanwhile, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
called on President Bush to take a tougher line to support
Lithuania's drive for independence.
   In Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev was still making
conciliatory-sounding statements to foreign officials about
Lithuania. Italian journalists reported that in talks with
the Italian foreign minister Tuesday, Mr. Gorbachev said he
would find a "political way out without abrupt movements."
   A blockade would seriously affect Lithuania, which buys
all its oil and gas from the Soviet Union. About 80% of
Lithuanian households depend on gas for heat and cooking. The
republic has enough gas to last about one month if supplies
are cut off, the spokeswoman said. The blockade could affect
the other two Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, because
the Mazeikiai refinery also supplies them, Lithuanian
officials say.
   Mr. Gorbachev issued his ultimatum of economic sanctions
against the Lithuanians Friday and gave them two days to
repeal several pro-secession laws passed by the republic's
parliament following its March 11 declaration of
independence. The Soviet leader says the laws, including ones
on Lithuanian citizenship and the function of the Red Army in
the republic, violate the Soviet constitution. The Lithuanian
parliament hasn't responded formally yet to Mr. Gorbachev and
adjourned its Tuesday session without a decision.
   But the Lithuanian prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene
issued a statement saying there would be no reprisals if the
blockade did take place. "They cut off the supply, we don't,"
she said, adding that Roman Catholic Lithuanians should act
"in a Christian manner."
   Despite several weeks of threats from Mr. Gorbachev, the
Lithuanians have refused to back off from their declaration
of independence, though they have signaled their willingness
to negotiate some of the laws they have passed since then.
They have repeatedly asked for meetings with the Soviet
president, but he has refused to meet with them.
   Economic sanctions could backfire on Moscow because even
though Lithuania is heavily dependent on the Soviet Union for
raw materials, the Soviets also rely on Lithuania for
products in short supply elsewhere, including meat, milk,
televisions and socks.
