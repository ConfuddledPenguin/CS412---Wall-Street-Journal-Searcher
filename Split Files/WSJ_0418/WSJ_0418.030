   PARIS -- French consumer prices in March rose a
provisional 0.3% from February and 3.4% from a year earlier,
the National Statistics Institute said.
   The result is at the high end of Paris market economists'
forecasts of a 0.2% to 0.3% rise, and represents a moderate
acceleration of France's monthly price growth, which was 0.2%
in February. The March figure, though, leaves year-to-year
price growth unchanged since the beginning of the year.

   If the provisional March result is confirmed when the
institute publishes its definitive data on April 27, this
would put the index -- the year 1980 equals 100 -- at 181.6
or 181.7, up from 181.1 in February and 175.7 in March 1989.
