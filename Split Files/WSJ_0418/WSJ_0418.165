   Safeway Stores Inc. said first-quarter net income surged
71% as a result of improved gross margins and a decline in
interest expense.
   The Oakland, Calif., supermarket chain posted profit of
$15.5 million, or 17 cents a share, up from $8.8 million, or
12 cents a share, a year earlier. Safeway had 88.2 million
shares outstanding in the 1990 quarter ended March 24,
compared with 79.7 million a year earlier.

   Safeway said revenue for the quarter grew about 3% to
$3.34 billion from $3.23 billion. The company said the
increase came despite the fact that the important Easter
shopping period occurred this year after the close of the
quarter.
   Safeway attributed its improved margins to the addition of
profitable speciality departments in numerous stores, an
aggressive merchandising campaign and a streamlining of its
companywide buying practices. Safeway also said its interest
expense fell 6% in the quarter to $83.8 million from $89.2
million a year earlier.
   Safeway has been closely held since 1986, when it was
taken private in a $4.3 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The company recently announced plans to
go public again by offering 10 million, or 10%, of its shares
later this month.
