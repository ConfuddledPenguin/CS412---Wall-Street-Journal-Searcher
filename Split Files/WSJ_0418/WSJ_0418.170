   Boeing Co. said it reached a tentative settlement of an
age-discrimination lawsuit brought on behalf of 29 pilots who
were removed from flight-test status when they turned 60.
   Under the tentative agreement with the Equal Opportunity
Employment Commission on a five-year consent decree, Boeing
agreed to raise the maximum flying age for its pilots to 63
from 60. The Seattle company also will establish a $4.4
million fund to be paid to the 29 pilots, representing "what
the former pilots would have received under the current
Boeing Pilot Early Leave Program."

   The commercial-airplane maker and defense contractor added
that in connection with raising its maximum flying age to 63,
it will establish an "enhanced medical protocol to determine
the pilot's fitness to fly after age 60." Boeing's "age 60"
policy, similar to the Federal Aviation Administration
requirement for commercial airline pilots, was instituted in
1980.
