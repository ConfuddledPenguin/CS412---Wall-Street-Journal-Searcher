   SUNDSTRAND Corp. said shareholders at the annual meeting
approved tripling to 150 million shares the Rockford, Ill.,
company's authorized common stock, which clears the way for a
previously announced 2-for-1 stock split. The aerospace parts
maker's directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 27.5
cents a post-split share. The split and the dividend are both
payable June 20 to stock of record June 6.
