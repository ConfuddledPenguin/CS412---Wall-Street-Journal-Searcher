   Xoma Corp., sparking the latest patent fight in
biotechnology, sued archrival Centocor Inc. for infringement
of a newly issued patent covering Xoma's drug to treat
certain potentially fatal bacterial infections.
   Xoma, based in Berkeley, Calif., said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office issued the patent to the University of
California, which had given Xoma exclusive rights to the
drug, called Xomen-E5. Xoma then filed its
patent-infringement suit in federal court in San Francisco.

   Xoma characterized the patent as covering use of
monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the toxins released by
gram-negative bacteria that often infect hospital patients,
such as those recovering from surgery. Xoma and Centocor have
asked the Food and Drug Administration for approval to market
such drugs, widely regarded as having the potential to be the
first big-selling monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic use.
Monoclonal antibodies are proteins such as those produced
naturally in the body to fight disease.
   Xoma's suit essentially asks the court to find that "if
Centocor were to market their product, they would infringe on
our patent," said Steven C. Mendell, Xoma chairman and chief
executive officer.
   James E. Wavle Jr., Centocor president, said of Xoma's
action, "I don't think it's going to stop us one iota. Based
on what we know, we don't believe the patent is valid, and
we're not infringing."
   The dispute threatens to lead to the next round of
prolonged patent litigation to come out of biotechnology.
Patent fights have broken out among other companies over the
anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO, and the heart drug
TPA.
   Both Centocor, of Malvern, Pa., and Xoma are betting much
of their short-term futures on their drugs to treat
gram-negative infections. According to some estimates, 80,000
people in the U.S. die from such infections every year. The
U.S. market for the drugs is often projected at $300 million
to $400 million.
   The patent issue arose as a surprise to followers of the
Xoma-Centocor race, partly because recent debate has centered
on the companies' claims about their clinical data. "It looks
like a coup for Xoma," said David Webber, a biotechnology
analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
   But Mr. Webber and others agreed that the just-issued
patent won't put the patent issue to rest if a patent with
overlapping claims emerges for Centocor's drug, called
Centoxin.
   Mr. Wavle of Centocor said various patent applications
covering Centoxin were made in 1983, about three years before
similar applications were made for Xomen-E5. Moreover, he
argued, scientific publications related to Centocor's work
were in the public domain before the Xomen-E5 application.
Xoma responded that it brought all prior work in the field to
the patent office's attention.
   Several analysts said the two companies may yet try to
reach some sort of cross-licensing agreement.
   At Vector Securities International Inc., analyst Peter
Drake said Mr. Mendell of Xoma and Hubert J.P. Schoemaker,
Centocor's chief executive, "are deal makers, not terminal
litigators."
   In national over-the-counter trading, Xoma rose $2 to
close at $20.75 a share, and Centocor fell $1.625 to $29.625.
