   THE SOVIET UNION ORDERED cuts in natural-gas supplies to
Lithuania.
   Moving to enforce a threatened economic embargo to break
the Baltic republic's independence bid, the Soviet government
said that gas supplies would be "sharply reduced," and that
oil and petroleum shipments may also be cut because of
Lithuania's refusal to rescind secession-related laws.
Lawmakers met in Vilnius to discuss the situation, but there
wasn't any indication that the order had been implemented. In
Washington, the U.S. was preparing to delay some dealings
with Moscow, including economic talks, if Lithuania's energy
supplies were reduced.
