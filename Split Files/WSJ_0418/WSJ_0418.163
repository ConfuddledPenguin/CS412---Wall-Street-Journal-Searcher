   NEW YORK -- Turner Corp. said it was awarded a contract
for Two International Place, a $95 million construction
project in Boston for Chiofaro Co., a Boston developer.
   Construction began last month; completion is scheduled for
early 1992. When the 35-story complex is finished, it will be
one of Boston's largest office projects, at 1.8 million
square feet, Turner Corp. said.
