   Baroid Corp. said a New Orleans jury found it, a retired
vice president and other defendants innocent of trying to fix
prices for oil-well completion fluids in 1986 and 1987.
   The Houston oil-field services concern -- controlled by
Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons -- and retired executive
Kenneth D. Tanner were indicted along with two other
companies and an executive of one of those concerns in
August.

   The indictment charged that Baroid, then a unit of NL
Industries Inc., and the two other companies conspired to
increase their prices for completion fluids by decreasing the
amount they paid customers for fluids that weren't used.
   The company said it was "gratified" that the jury agreed
with its position that it wasn't guilty of any offense.
