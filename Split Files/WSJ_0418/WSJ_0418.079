   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp., as expected, named
Steven Wheeler as executive vice president with
responsibility for a newly established "collecting bank" to
hold a substantial portion of the company's nonperforming
real estate assets.
   The announcement came as the bank holding company outlined
a strategy for improving its weakened capital base and
returning to profitability over the next 18 to 24 months --
but acknowledged that success of the plan could hinge on
economic conditions in New England.

   Lawrence Fish, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the collecting bank will be "an organizational concept for
the time being." But he said Bank of New England's aim is to
"define and isolate a portion of" its troubled assets and
"treat them in a fashion that will allow us in time to
finance them off our balance sheet."
   Mr. Fish said as much as $1 billion may be transferred to
the new entity and could be grouped into several portfolios,
such as commercial properties, condominiums, or hotels. "It
will take, I believe, a good three to four months to organize
that," he said. Bank officials said the shape of the plan
will depend, in part, on which assets investors seem most
interested in.
   In addition, Mr. Fish said Bank of New England will seek
to sell within six months its banking subsidiaries in Maine
and Rhode Island, each of which has about $1 billion in
assets. Mr. Fish said the company has had discussions with
several potential buyers of each unit, but hasn't received
formal bids.
   Those and other planned sales would leave Bank of New
England with about $20 billion in assets -- compared with
about $25 billion at March 31 -- and a banking network in
Massachusetts and Connecticut.
   Previously announced plans to slash staffing, along with
other expense reductions, are expected to reduce the
company's overall operating costs by the end of 1990 by 25%
to 30% from the level at the end of 1989, Mr. Fish said.
   Mr. Fish predicted the company will be profitable and will
meet or be close to meeting various regulatory capital
requirements after the strategic plan is completed, over the
next 18 to 24 months. But he acknowledged that the results
will depend "on a stabilized or slightly improving domestic
New England economy" during that period.
   Mr. Fish also said the company will begin to look for "new
sources of equity" and "will consider every option for
bolstering capital," as the company proceeds with its plan.
But he wouldn't discuss specific possibilities.
   In addition to announcing the appointment of Mr. Wheeler,
Mr. Fish said Bank of New England will name "in the next
couple of weeks" a senior credit officer "to be responsible
for rebuilding the quality {of the bank's} credit culture."
Mr. Fish also confirmed that Richard Stover will be in charge
of the controlled loan divisions, which manage problem loans,
at all of the company's subsidiary banks. Mr. Stover, who
joined Bank of New England late last year, previously was a
senior officer at Mellon Bank Corp.'s Grant Street National
Bank unit.
   Mr. Wheeler, former co-head of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s
Morgan Stanley Realty unit, has run a financial consulting
firm here for the past year, specializing in real estate
matters.
   Mr. Fish, a former Bank of Boston Corp. executive who took
over Bank of New England's top job just a month ago,
indicated the company is likely to bring in other new
officers in coming weeks.
