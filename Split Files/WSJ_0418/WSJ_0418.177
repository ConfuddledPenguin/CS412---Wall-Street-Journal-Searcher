   OK, maybe you're not going to jump to some other firm just
because of a country-club membership. Maybe you don't covet
that executive vice president's job simply because het gets
first-class air travel. But they sure help.
   Here's a rundown of the most popular corporate perks --
how many companies give them and how many executives get
them.
