   Problem commercial loans continued to balloon, sapping
earnings at two of the nation's biggest banks.
   Both Citicorp and NCNB Corp. of New York and Charlotte,
N.C., respectively, posted lower earnings than analysts had
expected, partly because of greater provisions for problem
loans. Citicorp's earnings plummeted 56%, while NCNB's rose
85%, reflecting in part its recent bank acquisitions.

   And Hibernia Corp., New Orleans, saw its first quarterly
loss in more than five years.
   Nevertheless, other big banks, Mellon Bank Corp. of
Pittsburgh and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., San Francisco, avoided big
increases in problem loans. Mellon reported earnings fell 16%
because of a year-earlier gain, while Wells's profit climbed
13%.
   Mellon, which a few years ago underwent a restructuring,
has small exposures to commercial real estate and leveraged
buy-outs, the two principal problem areas. And as for Wells
Fargo, the California real estate market hasn't seen the
deterioration that some other parts of the country have.
   Another big lender to leveraged buy-outs, Bankers Trust
New York Corp., also went against the general industry trend,
indicating that it expects higher earnings. Though earnings
won't be out until Friday, Chairman Charles S. Sanford said
results will exceed the $164.3 million, or $2.02 a share, of
a year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp
                                                                                                       

   The nation's largest banking company boosted its
charge-offs of bad loans and its provision for future losses
by about 80% as commercial real estate markets in the
Northeast and Southeast, as well as certain leveraged
buy-outs such as Campeau Corp., deteriorated.
   As a result of the provision and intense competitive
pressures, Citicorp saw earnings from its commercial and
investment banking business in Europe, North America and
Japan plummet 77% to $40 million from $173 million a year
earlier.
   The good news in Citicorp's results was that earnings from
its global consumer banking business continued to set
records, rising 26% to $270 million.
   And signaling that the company expects its operations to
remain healthy, the board boosted the quarterly dividend
9.9%, to 44.5 cents a share from 40.5 cents, payable May 10
to stock of record April 27.
   Total charge-offs rose to $679 million from $379 million a
year earlier, and the reported provision climbed to $570
million from $358 million a year earlier. Adjusted for
certain accounting changes, the provision rose to $675
million from $375 million.
   Nevertheless, Citicorp's loan quality didn't slide as
steeply as some securities analysts had expected. Total
nonperforming assets, including its Brazilian and Argentine
loans, rose 11% to $8.2 billion. Of that, non-performing
commercial loans in the U.S. rose $548 million to $3.3
billion.
   Alluding to some relatively larger additions to loan-loss
reserves by other banks, Chairman John S. Reed said in an
interview, "We're being conservative; we're not being crazy."
He added that he expects non-performing real estate loans to
continue to grow. but not as rapidly as in recent quarters.
   Despite the better-than-expected loan-quality picture,
some investors harbor lingering fears that asset quality
could worsen when the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
conducts its examination of Citicorp in June. Thomas Hanley,
analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said, "The eyes of Wall
Street will be on Citicorp's second-quarter results."
   Two other factors also dragged down Citicorp's quarterly
comparison. The year-earlier period included $66 million of
Brazilian interest payments, which have since been suspended.
In addition, Brazil's new anti-inflationary economic plan
kept results in its local banking business there flat by
removing $31 million in deposits from its Brazilian bank.
   The year-earlier period also included a $77 million
after-tax gain on the sale of a building in Tokyo.
   For the first time, Mr. Reed also raised doubts about
whether Citicorp would be able to boost its common equity to
4% of assets from the current 3.6% by year end through asset
sales and retained earnings. "It's going to be tight. I don't
know," Mr. Reed said.
                                                                                                       

   Wells Fargo
                                                                                                       

   Wells Fargo attributed its rise in net income to increased
interest income and a decline in its loan-loss provision. The
San Francisco bank's return on average assets rose to 1.32%
from 1.23% a year earlier, making its return one of the two
or three highest among the nation's major banks.
   First-quarter results benefited from continued robust
California real estate and consumer loan markets. The bank
holding company's net interest income for the quarter rose 3%
to $559.8 million, largely reflecting an increase in new
loans; net interest margin, the difference between what the
bank takes in on loans and what it pays for funds, declined
to 5.09% from 5.23%. Income from sources other than interest
on loans advanced 8% to $199.6 million, partly offsetting a
6% rise in non-interest expense to $411 million. Wells Fargo
attributed the jump in non-interest expense to costs
associated with recent acquisitions, and to an escalation of
bonuses paid to its rank-and-file employees under new salary
incentive programs.
   Wells Fargo's first-period loan-loss provision dropped to
$75 million from $100 million a year earlier. During the
quarter, the company completed the acquisition of two
California banking concerns, Valley National Bank of Glendale
and Central Pacific Corp. of Bakersfield. The banks have
combined assets of about $1.2 billion.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB Corp.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB Corp. reported an 85% rise in profit despite a
larger-than-expected provision to boost its reserve for
problem loans.
   Though the results dwarf those of the year-earlier period,
the latest figures are at the lower end of what many analysts
had expected.
   Indeed, some analysts indicated that the provision for
problem loans, as well as $23.8 million in securities gains
taken from NCNB's huge bond portfolio, may cause them to
review their 1990 estimates for the $64 billion-asset
company. Last month, NCNB officials said the bond portfolio
was sitting on $180 million in unrealized losses.
   "It's of course difficult to argue with these numbers, but
it's also difficult to extrapolate from this the $6 a share
(in earnings) everyone's looking for this year," said Henry
J. Coffey Jr., analyst at J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. Few big banking
companies are meeting expectations this quarter, he added.
   Officials at the Charlotte, N.C., banking company
yesterday reiterated their "comfort" with consensus analyst
estimates of $6-a-share earnings for 1990. That would be a
30% increase from the $4.44 a share posted for 1989.
   For the latest quarter, NCNB reported impressive deposit
and loan growth in a slowing economy, but its net interest
margin was squeezed to 3.22% from 3.96%. This was reflected
in net interest income, which fell slightly to $438.3 million
from $446 million in 1989's first quarter.
   NCNB also reported, as expected, a 25% increase in problem
loans -- in line with most banking-company results for the
quarter. But the period's $88.7 million loan-loss provision,
a 28% increase from the fourth-quarter provision, was about
$20 million more than some analysts had expected. "It's
obvious they could afford the hit and decided not to drag it
out," said John J. Mason, analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane
Inc.
   NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl said the company was
"disappointed by the increase in problem loans," but he added
that the loan-loss provision reflects the company's
"commitment to recognize and build the capacity to deal with
credit problems as they rise."
   Of the $88.7 million, $35 million went to strengthen
NCNB's reserve against future losses to $500.1 million.
Analysts estimated that the rest went to cover $54.1 million
in problem loans charged off in the first quarter.
                                                                                                       

   Mellon Bank Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Mellon's first-quarter earnings dropped largely because of
a year-earlier $24 million gain on early retirement of debt.
   In the latest period, Mellon reported that service-fee
income, including trust and cash management fees, advanced
4.9% to $171 million, while it cut costs 2.5% to $276
million.
   Nonperforming domestic real estate assets increased a
modest $4 million, to $216 million, from year end, and Mellon
slashed its nonperforming loans to less-developed countries
to $27 million from $160 million at year-end. The
first-quarter figure excludes $159 million of Mexican loans
that were restructured as part of a U.S. government-backed
financing plan. Under the plan, Mellon reduced interest
payments on Mexican loans in exchange for bonds
collateralized by zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities.
   Analysts who had been expecting improvements at Mellon
were pleased with the results. "We had very aggressive
earnings estimates, and they hit them," said Mr. Hanley of
Salomon Inc., which recently upgraded its position on Mellon
stock to hold from sell. "Whether measured in credit quality,
earnings or expense management, the quarter appeared to be
strong."
   One disappointment, he said, centered on net interest
revenue, which fell to $199 million from $212 million in the
year-earlier period. Mellon attributed the decline primarily
to a drop in interest receipts on nonperforming Brazilian
loans.
   At Mellon's annual meeting, Frank V. Cahouet, chairman and
chief executive officer, told shareholders that Mellon's
agreement in December to acquire 54 Philadelphia branches of
Meritor Savings Bank marked a turning point for the company.
"It closed one door on a period of restructuring and opened
another to a full decade of promise," Mr. Cahouet said.
                                                                                                       

   Hibernia
                                                                                                       

   Hibernia cited a special loan-loss provision of $50
million for its first-period deficit.
   Hibernia shrugged off the loss as a onetime glitch,
attributable largely to tough new credit-quality standards
that federal bank examiners are applying to spotlight
potential real estate problems early.
   As a result, the company doubled its total of
nonperforming assets to $139.5 million from $65.9 million at
year end. The special loan-loss reserve provision was
intended to maintain the company's level of reserves at 110%
of nonperforming assets, said O.C. Russell, vice chairman of
the Hibernia National Bank subsidiary.
   "Barring unforeseen events, we expect to return to
profitability and to our objectives of a minimum 16% return
on equity and consistent earnings-per-share growth," said
Martin C. Miler, chairman of Hibernia.
