   HOUSTON -- The small but well-respected Texas investment
banking firm of Duncan, Cook &amp; Co. sued one of its founders,
alleging that he diverted millions of dollars for personal
use.
   The company also said it is changing its name to Gulf
Partners Inc., effective immediately.

   In a lawsuit seeking at least $5 million in damages, the
firm charges former President and Treasurer Stephen C. Cook
with channeling company money into his own bank accounts to
satisfy large personal cash needs. It alleges that he used
the funds to underwrite costs related to a $1.4 million house
in an exclusive neighborhood here, a 2,800-acre recreational
estate in New York, more than a million dollars of
investments and "a high standard of living."
   Mr. Cook, an original shareholder in the firm, denied the
allegations. "Although I will accept responsibility as the
former chief executive officer for certain administrative
problems, the lawsuit seriously distorts the reality and
clouds a number of economic and compensation issues
involved," said Mr. Cook. He declined to elaborate.
   The suit says Mr. Cook, who was responsible for Duncan
Cook's daily operations and maintaining its books and
records, resigned from all his positions at the firm when his
"wrongful acts" were discovered.
   Mr. Cook, however, said he left to start his own
investment banking firm. "I intend to proceed with that," he
said. "I have enough friends in the investment community who
know me well enough that I'm confident they will keep an open
mind until this litigation is finalized."
