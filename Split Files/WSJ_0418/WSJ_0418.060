   TOKYO -- Kyotaru Co., a major Japanese restaurant chain

   Kyotaru said its U.S. subsidiary, Kyotaru International
Inc., has purchased all shares of Paragon Steakhouse
Restaurant from its holding company, Paragon Restaurant
Group, for $86 million.
   The chain currently has 54 restaurants, with about half in
California and Arizona, and overall sales of $97.6 million a
year. The acquired chain has overall assets of $53 million
and net assets of $34.7 million.
   Kyotaru International also acquired all the stock of
Love's Enterprise Co., a family restaurant chain with 22
outlets, primarily in California, from BSB Food Enterprise
Co.
   The price of the acquisition was $2.6 million. Love's
Enterprise has overall assets of $1.4 million and net assets
of $1.2 million, with yearly sales of $3.3 million.
   Kyotaru's third acquisition was made through its
subsidiary, KFF Management Inc., which purchased 16 Arby's
roast beef sandwich fast-food restaurants from DGH Food
Service Inc. for $5.8 million.
   The 16 Arby's, located in California's Los Angeles County,
have yearly sales of $9.7 million.
   Earlier this year, Restaurant Associates Industries, which
operates about 120 restaurants, said in New York that Kyotaru
acquired an 85% interest in the company.
   Restaurant Associates, which went private in 1988,
operates Mamma Leone's restaurant in New York, as well as the
Brasserie. It also operates the Acapulco, Charlie Brown's and
The Office restaurant chains.
   Kyotaru has annual sales of about $500 million, with
operations in department stores, railroad stations and
shopping centers.
