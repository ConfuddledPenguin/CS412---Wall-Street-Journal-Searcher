   Your March 27 page-one story on Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co.
and its parent, MCA, harped on an unfair and false theme that
Curry somehow acts improperly by making a profit in Yosemite.
It does not.
   Curry is the only major company in Yosemite because
Congress created and has endorsed repeatedly the concession
system in the national parks, which provides for a major
concessionaire in each national park. Congress adopted this
plan because it found that both the public and the protection
of the park are better served by one carefully regulated
concessionaire than by a hodgepodge of competing vendors.
Each price charged, all products and services, the hours of
operation and the level of service are all specifically
authorized and regulated by the National Park Service. Even
minor changes in construction or operations must be approved.

   The financial arrangements between the government and
Curry are governed by the system created by Congress. This
law also provides that service to the visitor and protection
of the resource are more important than the return of fees to
the government. The company has agreed to increase its
building-use fees and currently is negotiating an increased
franchise fee.
   In short, Curry is in the park as a contractor to the Park
Service to provide those services the Park Service determines
are in the public interest, in an environmentally sound
manner, and at totally regulated prices.
   Thus, the underlying theme of your story that there is
something untoward about making a profit under that detailed
system set up by Congress and administered by the Park
Service is extremely unfair.
   Curry did not, as you state, urge its visitors to vote for
expansion of facilities; it suggested they participate in the
planning process as others were doing. The company's position
has always been that the overnight-visitor level should
remain unchanged. We did not ask for more hotel rooms.
   The movie rental and barber shop you describe in
pejorative terms are authorized by the NPS and are primarily
for the benefit of employees, who otherwise might have to
drive 100-mile round trips on twisting, mountain roads for
these services.
   Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. shares Superintendent Mike
Finley's concern for increased funding to protect the park
and reduce the crowding on the few days it does occur. We
have carried out a wide range of environmental and
interpretive programs not required by our contract to assist
and supplement the park's services in these efforts. We look
forward to continuing to serve the public and protect the
park as we have in the past.
