   Lawyers who defend companies against personal injury suits
are working on new ways to deal with an old worry: juries
that are tempted to award big damages because they feel sorry
for critically injured plaintiffs.
   Here's how Chicago attorney Thomas Crisham handled it
recently when a corporate client was sued by a man so
severely hurt that his appearance alone might have swayed the
jury. He got a court order requiring the badly disfigured man
to appear at jury-selection hearings, then asked prospective
jurors whether sympathy would color their judgment.

   "I was trying to reduce the shock effect," asserts Mr.
Crisham, an attorney with Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson.
   He isn't alone. Convinced that sympathy fuels large jury
verdicts in product-liability and medical-malpractice cases,
defense lawyers are stepping up efforts to control it. Some,
such as Mr. Crisham, are mapping strategies aimed at
desensitizing jurors to plaintiffs' injuries. They're also
trying to undercut evidence that plaintiffs' attorneys use to
stir a jury's emotions, such as "day-in-the-life videos"
produced to dramatize the gruesome daily existence of badly
injured clients.
   Contending with sympathy isn't a new idea. But the notion
of confronting it head-on only recently has begun to pick up
steam. Strategy sessions on sympathy can now be found at
meetings of business-lawyer groups such as the Defense
Research Institute. The Federation of Insurance and Corporate
Counsel says it may produce a video that would illustrate how
to handle sympathy in jury trials. And defense lawyers say
clients are beginning to listen, instead of assuming that
most jury cases brought by critically injured plaintiffs must
be settled.
   "It's very much a hot topic," says J. Ric Gass, a defense
lawyer with Kasdorf, Lewis &amp; Swietlik in Milwaukee.
   Many say it's overdue, believing defense lawyers have too
often been upstaged by more creative plaintiffs' attorneys.
Moreover, they contend that sympathy is looming even larger
as damage cases get bigger and more technical. "Sympathy is
something jurors can relate to and focus on," says George
Walker, a defense attorney in Mobile, Ala., with Hand,
Arendall, Bedsole, Greaves &amp; Johnston. "We're constantly
trying to come up with ways to deal with it."
   Plaintiffs' lawyers dismiss the notion that cases turn on
sympathy. As they see it, jurors don't award damages from
sympathy, but for good reasons -- because someone has been
maimed by a careless physician, for example, or by a
dangerously defective company product. "My experience is,
defense attorneys like to talk a lot about sympathy," says
David Perry, a plaintiffs' attorney in Corpus Christi, Texas.
"When they lose, they use that as an excuse."
   The defense bar's current game plan is to tackle the
sympathy issue as early as possible in a case, a departure
from the once-traditional strategy of trying not to call
attention to a plaintiff's injuries. Mr. Crisham's tactic of
bringing a severely injured plaintiff before prospective
jurors may be unusual, but defense lawyers increasingly are
seeking court orders allowing them to show, for example, gory
photographs that they know the plaintiff's attorney plans to
introduce during the trial.
   "Sympathy cannot be swept under the rug," John P. Daniels,
an attorney with Daniels, Baratta &amp; Fine in Los Angeles, told
a meeting of insurance and corporate lawyers last year.
   Among his recommendations: Try to turn the tables on
plaintiffs' lawyers by suggesting in court that they're
deliberately exploiting sympathy to influence the jury; in
cases involving badly injured plaintiffs, such as
quadriplegics, call witnesses who are similarly disabled, to
show that quadriplegics can be rehabilitated and contribute
to society.
   How well such measures work is difficult to measure. But
Mr. Crisham believes his move helped persuade the plaintiff's
lawyer to accept a settlement favorable to the defendant, a
company accused of causing an explosion that injured the
plaintiff. And most defense attorneys contend that tactics
aimed at confronting the emotions of prospective jurors
improve the chances of selecting an impartial panel.
   John R. Woodard III, an attorney in Tulsa, Okla., cites a
medical malpractice case in which he asked prospective jurors
to examine graphic photos illustrating the results of surgery
that had destroyed tissue on the plaintiff's stomach and
required substantial skin grafts. Mr. Woodard, who was
defending the surgeon, says one would-be juror found the
pictures so upsetting she was excused from the case.
   "In the end, I was left with 12 jurors who had seen the
evidence before they were sworn in and had told me they could
set their emotions aside," says Mr. Woodard of Feldman, Hall,
Franden, Woodard &amp; Farris. Moreover, he asserts, the
plaintiff's attorney wasn't able to exploit the photographs
during the trial because the jurors had already been exposed
to them. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict for the
surgeon.
   But such strategy can't always anticipate a juror's
feelings, acknowledges E. Michael Kelly, one of Mr. Crisham's
law partners. He recalls an attorney who had gotten "all the
perfect answers" from one prospective juror, who was then
selected to serve in a medical malpractice case involving a
seriously injured newborn. Six days into the trial, the woman
asked to see the judge, said she was having nightmares about
the case and refused to continue. "You can cite me {for
contempt} if you want, but I'm not coming back," Mr. Kelly
recalls the juror telling the judge, who agreed to let her
go.
   In another case involving a badly injured child, a juror
was so distressed by the plaintiff's appearance that she
threw up in her handbag during the trial, says Mr. Kelly.
   Besides asking jurors to put aside sympathy, defense
lawyers also are trying to control the kind of evidence that
can arouse it, such as day-in-the-life videos. Because such
videos frequently are sophisticated products that can have a
major emotional impact, defense lawyers often try to bar them
on the grounds that they're biased toward the plaintiff.
   If that fails, and it often does, other moves may be too
late. "By the time such videos are shown to a jury, it's no
longer a question of whether the defendant caused the injury,
it's a question of what can we do for that poor plaintiff,"
according to Mr. Kelly.
   The attorney is trying a new tactic in defending Palos
Community Hospital in a Chicago suburb against a medical
malpractice suit brought by the parents of an infant with
cerebral palsy. He's seeking a court order allowing him to be
present during the production of a video about the baby. He
also wants an unedited copy of the video before trial.
   Mr. Kelly argues that such videos are too often staged, so
he's simply trying to ensure the reliability of highly
prejudicial evidence. But Chicago attorney Barry Goldberg,
who represents the infant, contends such procedures would
intrude on plaintiffs' private lives and invite harassment by
defense lawyers and liability insurers. After 23 years of
malpractice litigation, "I would put nothing past the
insurance industry," he told the trial judge in arguments on
the motion.
   Last December, a state appeals court granted Mr. Kelly's
request for all unedited film, but denied permission to watch
the filming. Mr. Kelly is appealing to the Illinois Supreme
Court.
