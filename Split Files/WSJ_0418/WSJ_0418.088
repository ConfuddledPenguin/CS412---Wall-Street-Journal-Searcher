   Mr. Delaney, 46 years old, said he resigned to set up his
own corporate finance business. He said he will retain his
4.5% stake in Horsham's stock and remain a director of the
company. "I'm not going too far away," he said. Mr. Delaney
said he left his job as a merchant banker to create Horsham
three years ago. "We've been successful beyond our wildest
expectations . . . but {Horsham} doesn't need to be run by a
merchant banker."
   Mr. Munk, 62, is founder of both Horsham and American
Barrick and controlling shareholder of Horsham. Horsham said
he will take "an active role in the management" of the
company.
   American Barrick said it named Gregory Wilkins chief
financial officer, succeeding Mr. Garbutt.
