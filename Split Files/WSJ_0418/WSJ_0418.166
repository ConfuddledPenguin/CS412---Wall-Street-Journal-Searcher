   NEW CANAAN, Conn. -- Smith Corona Corp. reported that
fiscal third-quarter net income fell 51%, as sales of its
pricier typewriters and word processors eased.
   Strong demand for lower-priced portable electronic
typewriters continues, but it's not enough to offset slow
high-end sales, said G. Lee Thompson, chairman and chief
executive officer. He cited a sluggish U.S. economy plus
price competition from Asian manufacturers.

   For the third period ended March 31, net fell to $6.1
million, or 20 cents a share, from pro forma net of $12.4
million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Smith Corona went public in August 1989. The year-ago figures
also reflect a charge of five cents a share, stemming from
the company's termination of a performance incentive plan.
   Sales dropped 9.1% to $110.6 million from $121.8 million.
   Smith Corona's "U.S. market position continues strong, and
we will remain as price competitive as necessary to retain
our leadership position, even at the expense of short-term
earnings," Mr. Thompson said.
   He said that Smith-Corona's international business,
especially in Europe, "is very promising." He added that the
company has been able to pare costs and inventories.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Smith Corona fell 50 cents to close at $9.125.
