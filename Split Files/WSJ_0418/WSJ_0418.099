   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts legislature rushed approval of
a bill designed to bolster Norton Co.'s sagging defense
against a proxy fight by BTR PLC, but takeover speculators
are betting the new law might only delay a BTR victory.
   The law requires Massachusetts companies to have staggered
terms for directors, with one-third elected every year,
effectively blocking BTR's attempt to win majority control of
Norton's board at Norton's April 26 annual meeting.

   Passage of the bill, expected to be signed by Gov. Michael
Dukakis this morning, is another sign of states becoming more
active to protect local companies from hostile takeovers.
Pennsylvania is expected soon to adopt the nation's most
stringent anti-takeover bill, which would garnish the profits
of short-term shareholders who sell after a failed attempt to
"control" a company and restrict voting rights of large
holders in proxy fights, among other things.
   "I think it's likely that you'll see other states
following the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania examples,"
predicted Robert A. Kindler, a partner and merger-law
specialist with Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, New York.
   The new Massachusetts law, introduced in response to the
bid for Norton, an abrasives maker based in Worcester, Mass.,
may not help Norton as much as its supporters hope, however.
Many takeover-stock traders said that even if BTR can only
get one-third of its nominees elected, that minority could
probably force the rest of Norton's board to negotiate with
BTR, a British conglomerate.
   Indeed, although Norton dropped 50 cents a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock
still closed at $76, above BTR's $75-a-share offer,
indicating that traders think Norton remains vulnerable.
   The new law "doesn't keep Norton independent; it just
gives them a card to play," said one trader. Mr. Kindler
added, "The usual wisdom is that if you are able to take over
even a third of the board of a target company, that puts
extraordinary pressure on the board. The Massachusetts-type
statute should not ultimately dissuade a hostile bidder."
   BTR's chances of winning board seats are considered good
because it has been tendered more than 60% of Norton's stock
in its $1.64 billion bid, currently scheduled to expire April
27. Moreover, if BTR completes its tender offer and buys the
Norton shares, it could replace another one-third of Norton's
board at next year's annual meeting, and thus win control of
the board.
   A Wall Street source said Norton told legislators it
needed action on the staggered-board bill by this week at the
latest. The urgency was prompted by a federal court ruling
last week that Norton couldn't cancel its scheduled annual
meeting and instead hold a special shareholders meeting on
June 26. Norton, which has appealed that ruling, said it
needed additional time to consider alternatives, such as the
sale of a minority stake to a friendly investor.
   The new Massachusetts law mandates staggered boards unless
the board of directors opts out and chooses to have a fixed
board with all members being elected annually. In addition,
an amendment was added permitting a change to a fixed board
by a two-thirds vote of shareholders -- although this clause
will take effect only after Jan. 1, 1992.
   The provision was added because the legislature "had
concerns about completely taking power from shareholders,"
said Laura McCarthy, a legislative aide. Asked why the Jan.
1, 1992, date was selected, she conceded that it was in part
to prevent BTR and its supporters from using their shares to
call a special meeting and then vote to abolish Norton's
staggered-term board.
   Other states are likely to follow suit in adopting
protective laws, several takeover law specialists said, even
though there has been a reaction against the Pennsylvania
bill from institutional investors, some corporations and even
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
Pennsylvania bill is intended to protect Armstrong World
Industries Inc., which is the object of a proxy contest and a
possible takeover bid from the Belzberg family of Canada.
   Ralph Whitworth, director of United Shareholders
Association, a national shareholder-rights group, criticized
the Massachusetts law as "an unprecedented assault on the
most fundamental right of shareholders. . . . The
Massachusetts legislature did the bidding of a few CEO's with
powerful conflicts of interest."
   But Mr. Kindler, the Cravath Swaine attorney, said he
believes the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania proposals are
allowed under the U.S. Constitution. "It is likely that the
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania statutes are constitutional,
since states can properly regulate the internal affairs of
corporations, including the election and terms for
directors," Mr. Kindler said. "In theory, a state could pass
a statute giving directors life tenure," Mr. Kindler said.
   Still, some takeover lawyers believe there eventually will
be a backlash against anti-takeover laws. Meredith Brown, a
partner and merger specialist with Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, New
York, said, "If the states carried the trend too far, there
is going to be some attempt to revive the idea of a federal
pre-emption in that area. But there is a fair amount of
running room because there's not much congressional support
for federal regulation of corporate affairs."
