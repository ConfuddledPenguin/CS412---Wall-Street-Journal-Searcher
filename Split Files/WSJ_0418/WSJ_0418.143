   Allied Stores Corp. will close its Jordan Marsh stores in
Lowell, Mass., and Danbury, Conn. The store closings are the
first since Allied and Federated Department Stores Inc. filed
for bankruptcy court protection on Jan. 15.
   Federated and Allied spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the
store closings aren't related to the bankruptcy-court filings
of the two Campeau Corp. units. Robert Gottlieb, Jordan Marsh
senior vice president for marketing, said both closings had
been under consideration before the Chapter 11 proceedings
began. But, he said, the filings may have "sped up the
process a little bit. Certainly cash flow becomes a major
factor."

   Both stores were poor performers, according to Mr.
Gottlieb. The Lowell store will close June 20, the Danbury
store, around July 15.
   Mr. Gottlieb said Jordan Marsh would try to find jobs at
other stores for the 82 employees of the Lowell store and the
129 employees of the Danbury store.
   A lawyer representing Allied creditors complained that the
company hadn't sought approval from the bankruptcy court
judge. Such approval isn't needed for decisions made in the
ordinary course of business.
