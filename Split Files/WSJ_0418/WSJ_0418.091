   The clue was "Johnson,"
   Three spaces to fill.
   No problem, I thought --
   That is, until
   I was reminded
   That time marches on:
   I'd filled in "Van";
   The answer was "Don."
   -- Annie Komorny.

   Quite different opinions are given,
   As high marks come from business pundits,
   And lower ones from those being driven.

   Our speaker tonight has risen to every occasion; but at
his age, just not as often.
