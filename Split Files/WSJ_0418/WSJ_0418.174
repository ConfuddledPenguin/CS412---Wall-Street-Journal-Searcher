   Petroleum prices fell again as much as 41 cents a barrel
even as oil ministers of three major Persian Gulf producers
met to discuss falling prices.
   Crude prices had firmed Monday on news of the meeting in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and on the kingdom's warning that oil
markets would remain weak if the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries continued to produce above its first-half
ceiling.

   Joining Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, were Ali
Khalifa Al-Sabah and Mana Said Otaiba, ministers of Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, respectively. All have been
accused of contributing to the oil glut by producing more
than their OPEC quotas.
   In an effort to blunt such criticism, the three ministers
issued a joint statement last night through the Saudi Press
Agency that affirmed their support for OPEC quotas and
expressed "grave concern" about pricing developments. "They
decided that the solution which can guarantee relative
stability in the market is a commitment from OPEC members to
the production ceiling and to the quotas distributed among
the member states," the statement said.
   The ministers said they will continue consultations with
their counterparts elsewhere in an effort to restore
stability to markets. But they didn't promise any production
cuts in their own countries.
   Industry analysts expressed doubt that the statement would
prop up the price of oil. "It's too bland to have any
immediate effect -- considering the caliber of the people who
met," said Antonio M. Szabo, vice president of Bonner &amp; Moore
Market Consultants.
   The meeting began too late to have any impact on
yesterday's oil trading, and crude prices resumed their fall.
In Europe, where oil markets had closed Friday and Monday for
Easter, spot prices of North Sea crudes were down 10 cents to
25 cents a barrel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price of
West Texas Intermediate for May delivery dropped 41 cents a
barrel to settle at $17.44. Less volatile, the June crude
contract was down 28 cents to $18.39. Outer month crude
contracts were mostly higher.
   Worries that the industry would report higher U.S. crude
oil inventories weighed heavily on the markets yesterday.
But, after trading had closed, the American Petroleum
Institute released its latest U.S. oil statistics showing
that crude inventories were up only 814,000 barrels last
week, much less than expected.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures rose amid
reports that heavy rains are delaying the harvest in Brazil
and that cold temperatures would sweep across regions of
Argentina where the soybean crop hasn't yet been harvested.
The weather forecast offset growing worries that the Soviet
Union might sacrifice its chances to win Most Favored Nation
status from the U.S. if tensions escalate over Lithuania's
drive for independence. Yesterday President Bush warned that
the U.S. might respond somehow if the Soviet Union cuts
natural gas supplies to Lithuania. Before the Lithuania
predicament, U.S. grain traders had been speculating that
Soviet purchases of U.S. crops, in particular soybeans, might
increase substantially if the Soviets received the
preferential treatment given to countries granted Most
Favored Nation status by the U.S. Meanwhile, traders are
continuing to shrug off reports that the Soviet Union is
having trouble paying its debts in a timely fashion to U.S.
exporters. Last week, some Japanese trading companies
extended credit to the Soviet Union so that it could continue
to purchase U.S. goods. The Soviet Union has had an excellent
reputation for several years of immediately meeting its
obligations to trading partners. However, the economic
restructuring under way in the country is causing disarray.
The Soviet payment problems should become less of a factor in
the U.S. grain markets because Soviet purchases usually slow
by late June. Prices of corn futures rose yesterday amid
reports that cool wet weather is slowing the early planting
of the crop in the U.S. Prices of most wheat contracts
dropped slightly.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell, then partially recovered. The
May contract finished 0.25 cent a pound lower at $1.1625. The
contract had opened off 0.70 cent and sank as low as $1.1450
before rebounding. On Monday after New York's Commodity
Exchange had closed, Southern Peru Copper Corp. announced a
force majeure on April shipments because of a monthlong
strike by production workers. A force majeure allows a
company to stop shipments because of uncontrollable events,
such as a strike. A senior executive at a major wire producer
said, "The reason the force majeure had no effect is because
{two weeks ago} any reasonable observer saw that the company
was essentially in one." Two other potentially price-firming
developments also had no effect yesterday: The London Metals
Exchange announced that its stocks at the end of last week
were down 650 metric tons to 54,575, a 24-month low. Stocks
at the Comex were off 58 tons to 3,504. John Gross, publisher
of the Copper Journal, an industry newsletter, said he is
puzzled. "The fundamentals are bullish and yet the market
seems to move lower for either technical or seasonal
reasons," he said. He noted that the U.S. Mint's purchase of
copper by regular tender yesterday wasn't particularly
encouraging with the price paid, after the usual adjustments,
essentially equal to the Comex spot price. "One news service
said it was constructive, but I don't read it that way," he
said. Mr. Gross was encouraged by copper's closing above
$1.16, which is viewed by market technicians as an important
support level, after sinking below it. However, Mr. Gross
believes that bearish traders were probably encouraged by
auto sales for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which
for the first 10 days of April were down sharply, along with
a 9.3% decline in housing starts last month. The senior
executive at the wire-making company said he has seen some
signs of weakness with rumors of some brass mills selling
copper from inventory. He added that he has spoken with
several water-tube producers who confirm that business isn't
robust.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Prices fell, with the May contract finishing $43 a
metric ton lower at $1,259. According to Harry Schwartz,
senior research analyst for tropical commodities at Cargill
Investors Services Inc. in New York, cocoa's recent price
run-up and subsequent sell-off were spurred by events in
Brazil. "The price drop is probably due to the perception
that cocoa shipments will soon resume and not due to actual
shipments," he said. But Mr. Schwartz noted that the price
decline could also be simply an expected correction. By the
middle of last week, May cocoa had climbed to $1,350 a ton,
up nearly 30% from about $1,050 a month ago. That steep
increase came about, according to Mr. Schwartz, because of
the Draconian economic measures introduced by the newly
elected president of Brazil to curb inflation. Among other
things, the measures that were introduced included freezing
nearly all bank account assets. Even though shipments might
soon resume, Mr. Schwartz thinks that for the next 18 months,
while these strictures are in force, cocoa producers might
not have enough cash to purchase fertilizers and herbicides
for their trees or, perhaps, not even have enough money to
pay for workers for harvesting the crop. "Long-term these
developments have to be bullish for cocoa prices," Mr.
Schwartz said.
