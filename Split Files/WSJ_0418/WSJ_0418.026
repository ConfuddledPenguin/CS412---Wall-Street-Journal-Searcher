   TOKYO -- The Japanese economy continues to expand on
strong corporate fixed investment and private consumption
expenditures, despite the recent instability in the markets,
the Bank of Japan said.
   In its monthly Review of Monetary and Economic Trends, the
central bank said fixed investment by both manufacturers and
non-manufacturers continues to be strong while private
consumption, boosted by rising disposable income, remains
firm.

   The report comes amid fears that the roughly 27% fall of
the Tokyo stock market since January, together with the yen's
weakness, higher oil prices and higher interest rates, will
have a large, negative impact on the Japanese economy.
