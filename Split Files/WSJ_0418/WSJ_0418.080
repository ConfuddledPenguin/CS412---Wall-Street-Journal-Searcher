   LONDON -- Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French cross-channel
tunnel consortium, told its main creditor banks that it may
need about #500 million ($815 million) on top of the #7.2
billion it had previously targeted as its total project
costs, banking sources said.
   Eurotunnel asked the bankers last week if they would
commit to added funding, the sources said. They said the
consortium said the funds would serve as a financial cushion
against rising interest rates and other contingencies,
including cost overruns still technically in dispute with
contractors.

   A number of project estimates were still under discussion
and negotiations over interim and permanent financing for the
project weren't yet complete, the sources said. They said
that a firm commitment on permanent financing may take months
to hammer out, although an agreement over providing
Eurotunnel with further short-term operating funds was
increasingly likely.
   Eurotunnel said in January when it reached an agreement
with its banks over a short-term credit of #400 million that
it was preparing fresh project estimates. It said those
estimates would be disclosed when it released its 1989 final
results on April 23.
