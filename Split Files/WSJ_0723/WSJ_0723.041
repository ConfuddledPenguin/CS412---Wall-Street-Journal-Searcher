   BUSH LAUNCHED a search for a successor to Justice Brennan,
who resigned.
   The 84-year-old liberal justice's resignation Friday after
a term of nearly 34 years gives the president his first
opportunity to influence the Supreme Court's character. But
it raises the risk of a Senate confirmation fight, and of
further GOP schisms. The likely appointment of a conservative
will be felt when the court begins its next session Oct. 1.
On abortion and separation of church and state, the court's
decisions may have a stronger conservative aspect.
Affirmative action and civil-rights rulings also may be
affected. The departure of Brennan could bring a liberal era
on the Supreme Court to an end.

   A COURT REVERSED North's conviction in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The reversal by a federal appeals court in Washington
Friday was on the grounds that trial proceedings may have
been tainted by exposure to his testimony before Congress.
North was convicted of destroying documents, accepting an
illegal gratuity, and aiding in the obstruction of Congress.
The former national security aide received a suspended jail
sentence and a $150,000 fine. The court dismissed a lower
court's ruling on the document-shredding conviction. The
other two counts weren't dismissed, but the decision improves
North's chances of being cleared.
   The ruling may benefit former National Security Adviser
Poindexter, who received a six-month jail term in June for
his role in the Iran-Contra affair.

administration's defense budget request.

   An aftershock struck Baguio in the Philippines, creating
panic among thousands of people camping in the streets of the

which the death toll stands at 1,043.

   The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Friday that a reporter's
promise of confidentiality to a source doesn't constitute an
enforceable contract. The ruling overturns a $200,000 verdict
against the state's two biggest papers, whose reporters told
a source he wouldn't be identified but then were overruled by
editors.

because of an Iranian death threat.
