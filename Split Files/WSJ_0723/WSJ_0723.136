   PHILADELPHIA -- Wall to Wall Sound &amp; Video Inc. filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code after it failed to reach an agreement with lenders.
   Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor
suits while it works out a plan to repay its debts.

   Wall to Wall, a chain of 88 music and electronics stores,
said it filed the bankruptcy-law petition after loan talks
broke down and lenders demanded immediate payment of certain
term loans and lines of credit. The Cinnaminson, N.J.,
company reportedly has about $22.4 million in unsecured debt.
   Wall to Wall officials could not be reached for comment.
In a statement late Friday, the company's president and chief
executive officer, Jerome Shulman said, "We believe that the
action we are taking today will give the company the
breathing room necessary" to complete previously reported
strategic changes.
   In May, the company said it was phasing out the
electronics portion of its business to concentrate on audio
and video software.
