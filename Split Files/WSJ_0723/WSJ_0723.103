   WASHINGTON -- For more than a decade, William Brennan had
flirted with the idea of retiring. Always in the past, his
love for the job of Supreme Court justice and his role as the
court's most ardent defender of individual rights and
liberties finally outweighed all other considerations.
   This time was different. In the Newark, N.J., airport
three weeks ago, en route to a North Sea cruise, he hit his
head in a fall that left him periodically disoriented
throughout the trip. Although he didn't know it at the time,
he had suffered a minor stroke. Last Tuesday, when Mr.
Brennan returned to Washington, he was forced to face medical
reality. He spent the next two days consulting with his
doctors and family. There was relatively little dissent.

   "I had no choice," Justice Brennan said in a telephone
conversation yesterday, "but to give it all up."
   The 84-year-old justice's resignation on Friday after
nearly 34 years gives President Bush his first opportunity to
influence the character of the Supreme Court. It also gives
him a chance, if he chooses to take it, to assuage
conservatives angry with him on other issues by moving the
deeply divided court significantly to the right. At the same
time, though, it raises substantial political risks: of a
potentially bruising Senate confirmation fight, and perhaps
of deepening the schisms within the Republican coalition on
the explosive issue of abortion -- where a new nominee will
be under enormous pressure from social conservatives to vote
to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.
   The effects of the liberal Justice Brennan's departure and
his likely replacement with a conservative will be felt
almost immediately once the court begins its next session on
Oct. 1. On abortion and issues of separation of church and
state, the conservatives already have a 5-4 edge. But
differences among themselves have somewhat slowed their
course to the right.
   On some matters, the court's liberal wing still has
managed to muster some major 5-4 victories, particularly on
affirmative action and some other civil-rights issues, on
freedom of expression, and on the rights of accused
criminals. Justice Brennan's departure is likely to bring
those victories to an abrupt halt. Mr. Bush may get further
chances to cement the conservative cast of the court, as
liberal justices Harry Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall are in
their early 80s.
   On abortion, administration officials say, Mr. Bush is
virtually certain to nominate a jurist opposed to Roe vs.
Wade. And, although a moderate himself on many domestic
issues, the president firmly believes his rhetoric about
favoring judges who lean toward strict construction of the
Constitution's meaning and who dislike judicial activism.
   Some administration aides see a timely opportunity for Mr.
Bush to regain ground with conservatives offended by his tax
and other positions by doing what he would do naturally --
pick someone with generally conservative judicial views.
"Just by doing what he wants to do anyway he'll re-energize
conservative support," says one senior administration
official.
   But such a nomination also could drive a deeper wedge
between the social conservatives of the Republican Party and
voters, particularly younger ones, who hold more liberal
social views but hew to the GOP line on economics and
national security. This rift, already apparent on issues like
the environment and civil rights legislation, has been an
undercurrent since the day the party nominated Mr. Bush in
1988. But it is a division Mr. Bush's advisers, particularly
GOP National Chairman Lee Atwater, have tried to keep out of
view. The court opening, while not creating the rift, could
serve to bring it into clearer focus.
   The administration may try to avoid political divisiveness
by looking for a conservative nominee with other attributes
that can be emphasized to moderates -- for instance, by
naming the first Hispanic to the court.
   In comments to reporters over the weekend, President Bush
said he wants a choice "very, very soon," which aides say
means later this week or early next. Mr. Bush hopes to win a
promise from the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold
confirmation hearings in early September, and then use the
August congressional recess to drum up support for the
candidate. Conservatives are still smarting from what they
consider President Reagan's failure during a similar recess
in 1987 to rally support for former Judge Robert Bork, whose
Supreme Court nomination was defeated.
   The administration hopes such a schedule will either win
Mr. Bush a successful vote before November's mid-term
elections, or else allow the Republicans to turn a Senate
rejection into an issue to attack Democrats.
   Among lists of candidates for the high court vacancy,
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr and federal appeals court
judge Patrick Higginbotham of Dallas are favorites of some
Bush aides. Others outside the administration are urging the
president to be more venturesome and appoint a Hispanic
(possibilities include district judge Ricardo Hinojosa of
Brownsville, Texas, and appellate judge Ferdinand Fernandez
of Los Angeles) or a second woman justice (possibly appellate
judges Edith Jones of Houston or Cynthia Hall or Pamela
Rymer, both of Los Angeles).
   Other potential nominees include David Souter, a former
New Hampshire Supreme Court justice recently appointed to the
federal appeals court in Boston; J. Harvie Wilkinson, a
federal appeals court judge in Charlottesville, Va.; Ralph
Winter, a federal appeals court judge in New Haven, Conn.;
and Laurence Silberman, an appeals court judge in Washington,
D.C.
   Assuming Mr. Bush names a staunch conservative, it is
possible that Senate Democrats will try to block the
nomination, and it is assured that abortion-rights activists
will. In doing so, opponents are likely to focus on the
legacy built by Justice Brennan, who since being appointed to
the court by President Eisenhower in 1956 has played a
significant role in virtually every major constitutional
decision affecting modern society.
   When he arrived on the high court at age 50, the always
cheery and congenial Mr. Brennan brought with him an uncanny
ability to befriend and work with his colleagues, even those
with whom he disagreed. Former law clerks recount seeing him
pause in the hallway en route to the court's secret
conferences to await fellow liberal Blackmun or former swing
vote Lewis Powell, who is now retired. They would then walk
off arm in arm.
   But Mr. Brennan has long bridled at his public image --
that of an affable Irish politician glad-handing fellow
justices and cajoling them to join him.
   Rather, one thing that made him so effective, liberal
admirers and conservative critics alike concede, was an
unusually pragmatic approach to the job. He loved to tease
his law clerks year after year by asking them what was the
most important principle of constitutional law. When they
were stumped, he would hold up five fingers. "You can't do
anything around here without five votes," he would say. He
wasn't saying that anything the majority did was right, he
would explain, but rather that in his view of the job the
point was to win majorities.
   That pragmatic approach always dictated his handling of
court opinions, say former clerks and some justices. More
than most, Justice Brennan would go to great lengths to make
changes in opinions, reword arguments and otherwise
accommodate colleagues to obtain and keep a majority.
   He also had an unwavering view of the role of the court in
interpreting federal laws and the Constitution. A few years
ago he wrote to a law professor that he struggled daily as a
judge with whether to rely simply on "reason" or to "go
beyond sterile rationability and have government treat its
citizens with dignity." He added, "A judge who operates on
the basis of reason alone risks cutting himself off from the
wellspring from which concepts such as dignity, decency and
fairness flow."
   Conservative critics have long attacked this approach as
judicial activism, leading judges to legislate their personal
views from the bench. More recently, conservatives have
called for a return to emphasis on the intent of those who
ratified the Constitution.
   Justice Brennan shrugged off such criticism, declaring in
a 1985 speech, "We current justices read the Constitution in
the only way we can: as 20th Century Americans. . . . The
ultimate question must be, what do the words of the text mean
in our time?"
   His effectiveness within the institution is documented in
the opinions that bear his name -- and in some that don't.
Public and private court records show that he wrote most of
the 1958 decision requiring the Little Rock, Ark., schools to
desegregate, although it was signed by all nine justices for
emphasis. This included the still-controversial assertion
that it is not only the Constitution that is the "supreme law
of the land" and must be obeyed, but the Supreme Court's
interpretation of it as well.
   Justice Brennan also played a major part behind the scenes
in reshaping both Justice William Douglas's 1965 decision
first recognizing a constitutional right of privacy and
Justice Blackmun's 1973 decision recognizing a right to
abortion.
   His concern for the individual has dominated not only his
opinions but his personal style. Court employees stop in to
say hello to him regularly, and he knows dozens of them by
their first names. Last Friday, he wanted badly to delay his
announcement so he could first meet this morning with four
new law clerks who were scheduled to begin work for him
today. But word of his decision leaked out and forced the
Friday announcement.
   Mr. Brennan's legal legacy is sweeping. Among other
things, his opinions chased from the scene the old notion
that you can't fight city hall: A series of decisions made it
possible to sue state and local governments for damages for
violating the civil rights of individuals, and in some
circumstances even to sue members of Congress or other
federal officials over civil liberties.
   Perhaps the most significant change in the legal landscape
came during his tenure under Chief Justice Earl Warren, when
the court made most of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights
applicable to the actions of state and local government
rather than just to the federal government. Justice Brennan
was the chief advocate of the incremental approach, selecting
only those constitutional protections that seemed most
important, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination.
   Other significant aspects of his legacy include most of
the major decisions upholding affirmative action; a losing
fight to have the death penalty declared unconstitutional;
and decisions broadening free speech and free press
guarantees, including protecting the news media against libel
suits by public figures and, most recently, protecting
flag-burning as a form of expression. He also wrote the 1962
opinion that led to the principle of "one person, one vote"
by finding that federal courts had the authority to require
voting reapportionment.
   Still another area in which Mr. Brennan had a significant
impact was in expanding the 14th Amendment guarantee of "due
process" to require that welfare recipients receive hearings
before benefits are cut off. The decision was the first step
in a virtual due-process revolution that was later expanded
to, among other things, increase the protections of
government employees.
   It is typical of Justice Brennan, given his concern with
the effects of constitutional law on the individual, that he
has come to see this last area as possibly "my most important
decision in its practical significance."
