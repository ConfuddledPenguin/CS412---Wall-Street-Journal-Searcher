   MGM/UA COMMUNICATIONS CO. said it distributed $4 a share
to its shareholders from a partial payment made by Pathe
Communications Corp. in its $1.3 billion agreement to buy the
movie studio. The payment gives majority shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian a gain of $180 million. Mr. Kerkorian, who has
worked to sell the beleaguered studio for two years, owns
about 35 million of MGM/UA's 51 million common shares and 10
million preferred.
