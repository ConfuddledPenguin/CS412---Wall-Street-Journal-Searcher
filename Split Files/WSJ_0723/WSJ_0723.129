   Lorimar Telepictures Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc.,
filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking $4
million in damages from LJN Toys Ltd. for allegedly breaching
a pair of toy licensing agreements.
   MCA Inc. agreed to sell LJN, its financially troubled toy
making unit, to Oyster Bay, N.Y.-based Acclaim Entertainment
last March.

   The complaint alleges that LJN agreed to pay Lorimar a $3
million advance for use of characters from its TV show
"Thundercats" by last Aug. 31, and that the payment was not
made. Lorimar also alleges that $1 million of a "royalty
guarantee" for use of the characters from "The Comic Strip"
was not paid by Dec. 31. LJN executives couldn't be reached
for comment.
