   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Aztar Corp. said solid second-quarter
performance at its casinos was offset by a $33.6 million
provision for a court judgment, resulting in a net loss of
$25.2 million, or 62 cents a share.
   The company had a net loss of $8.1 million, or 20 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 6.7% to $131.3 million
from $140.7 million.

   Operating profit before net rent nearly tripled to $22.6
million from $8 million, largely because of improved
operating profit at TropWorld, Aztar's Atlantic City, N.J.,
casino. In the face of the opening of a major competitor, the
Taj Mahal casino, TropWorld reported operating profit of
$12.9 million, up from $7.4 million, on a slight decline in
revenue to $78.2 million. Results for the year-earlier
quarter included the write-off of $2.6 million of previously
deferred pre-opening expenses.
   Paul E. Rubeli, the casino operator's president and chief
executive officer, said cutbacks in bus-patron business and
the elimination of other marginal business contributed to
improved operating profits in Atlantic City. In Nevada, the
Las Vegas Tropicana and the Ramada Express in Laughlin both
posted improved operating income in the face of expanded
competition.
   The quarter included an extraordinary charge of $3.5
million to reverse a first-quarter extraordinary gain from
using a portion of a 1989 net operating loss carry-forward.
The prior-year quarter included a $5 million loss for the
closing of a Reno, Nev., casino and expenses of $1.3 million
from the company's restructuring.
   The legal judgment involved the 1979 purchase of the
Tropicana by Ramada Inc., Aztar's predecessor. On July 3, the
Nevada Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision awarding
Hotel Conquistador Inc. and its holders $14,225,000 with
14.5% interest from January 1982, plus attorney's fees and
other costs. Aztar said it will petition for a rehearing.
   For the six months, Aztar posted a net loss of $15.9
million, or 40 cents a share, compared with a net loss of
$26.7 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell to $256.4 million from $259.2 million.
   John Uphoff, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Co., said the
results reflect well on Aztar's ability to control costs and
improve margins in the face of major new competitors.
   The company also said it bought back about 700,000 common
shares, or 35% of the two million shares in a repurchase
authorization approved in May. Aztar has about 40.8 million
common shares outstanding.
