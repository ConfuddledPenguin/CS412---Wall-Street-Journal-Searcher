   HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. -- By the time the New Kids on the
Block concert begins at 9:30 p.m., the amphitheater is as
humid as a wet sock, and the groupies are agog.
   Each hip rotation by the rockers drives the 24,000 fans
into a frenzy. Ivory Flores, a pretty brunette who hasn't
slept in 24 hours, is hoarse and breathless. Janice Shoop,
who spent the day prowling the parking lot of a nearby hotel
hoping for a glimpse of the five young men in the group, is
weak from joy. Rachel Simon, a brown-eyed beauty with blond
tresses in French braids, is transfixed.

   So what if it is past their bedtime?
   Rachel is six years old and a recent graduate of
kindergarten, but she is hardly out of place at this
after-hours gig. Nor is seven-year-old Ivory, or Janice, who
just turned eight. The New Kids are the Beatles of the
prepubescent set, not in talent but in appeal. The open-air
Poplar Greek music pavilion here looks more like day camp
than a rock concert.
   "I just love Jordan," coos Rachel. (Jordan Knight, 19, is
one of the New Kids.) Rachel's principal other interests, she
says, are "playing" and watching "Sesame Street." Says her
mom, Linda: "I loved Frankie Avalon, but, come on, I was in
high school."
   Paul McCartney, cover your ears. The New Kids are five
Boston lads aged 17 to 21 who didn't know how to read music
before they were recruited in 1985 by promoter Maurice Starr
-- and who still don't play guitars. But they stand to share
about $55 million in earnings this year. And why not? They
are cute and their bubble-gum music is wildly popular with
the preteen set. About 80% of the take is from New Kids
merchandise, 15% from record sales, 5% from concerts.
   In rock history various groups assembled by promoters,
from the Monkees to Menudo, have touched this especially
young audience. Sibling acts like the Osmonds and the Jackson
Five had big preteen followings, too. But concessionaires and
critics alike say that never before have parking lots filled
with so many station wagons and minivans, and auditoriums
with so many parents, captives of kids too young to go out
alone.
   "I wouldn't really say (the) music represents the decline
of the West, but I don't think you can find a dozen fans over
the age of 18," says Rolling Stone senior editor Anthony
DeCurtis. At least some older children reject the New Kids as
kids' stuff. Some radio stations shun their records, as did
MTV for a while, because they don't want to turn off older
kids with deeper pockets. The music has been called the
beltless slacks of the entertainment field by one critic and
"a hormonal response rather than music per se," by another.
People magazine's critic David Hiltbrand writes that the
musical content of the New Kids album "Step by Step" is "not
unprecedentedly shabby." But that is as enthusiastic as he
gets: "Most of this record is perfectly horrid fluff."
   Still, the quintet is clean-cut and camera-ready, plucked
from the streets of blue-collar Boston by Mr. Starr, now 36,
whose main interest was the boys' looks. (In fact, an FBI
agent at one point contacted Mr. Starr in response to a
parent's complaint, to ask why he was handing out business
cards to good-looking young boys.) Mr. Starr, a musician
himself, had earlier put together a black group called New
Edition, which also hit it big. He and his partner, Dick
Scott, who arranges bookings for the New Kids, get a 20%
management fee for concerts and share in the proceeds from
the sale of merchandise and recordings. Mr. Starr originally
wanted tight control of the group itself, including the power
to replace members as they get too long in the tooth for the
concept, but according to the boys' lawyer, Barry Rosenthal,
"the Kids got too big."
   The New Kids sing harmless lyrics suburban grade-schoolers
can understand and that are a far cry from the X-rated
effusions of Guns n' Roses, Motley Crue and 2 Live Crew.
Parents are relieved if not thrilled that the group endorses
milk-drinking and saying "no" to drugs.
   The New Kids are an industry, thanks to the sufferance of
parents. This year, Block Heads and Kidophiles (nicknames
given to New Kids fans) will buy more than $800 million in
New Kids toys, sleeping bags, lunch kits, pillowcases,
trading cards, cartoons, puzzles and other gear. New Kids
dolls will be introduced next month by Hasbro Inc. A New Kids
Nintendo video game is in the works, also New Kids comic
books. Ralston Purina Co. wants to market a New Kids
breakfast cereal, though talks are bogged down. The New Kids
want marshmallows; Ralston does not.
   The New Kids autobiography, "Our Story," is No. 6 on the
New York Times list of paperback best sellers. Written for
the newly literate, it is heavy on photos and light on
insight. Writes New Kid Joe McIntyre: "I started school in
kindergarten." Confesses Donnie Wahlberg: "In high school I
started getting zits."
   Children eat this stuff up.
   Ivory Flores's bedroom in Roselle, Ill., is an archive of
New Kids memorabilia. Not only is it covered wall-to-wall
with New Kids posters, it is also furnished in New Kids tote
bags, bracelets, watches, $50 and $125 jackets,
back-to-school books, off-to-school lunch pails, thermoses,
puzzles, beach towels, party plates and invitations, a
shellacked New Kids walnut and a $200 New Kids grandfather
clock. Ivory doesn't sleep in the room herself; she doesn't
want to disturb the exhibit.
   The Floreses have spent more than $8,000 so far on their
daughter's New Kids fancy, including a score of concert
tickets purchased from scalpers at between $60 and $375
apiece. "Sometimes I get angry at these people for coming out
with all this new stuff," says Ivory's mother, Annette. "I
can't afford to buy myself a decent dress."
   Other children, less extravagant or with less-indulgent
parents, are just as spellbound.
   Alice Barry, seven, has a pinup of the New Kids stretched
across her bedroom ceiling in Wichita, Kan. "I want them to
be the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning and
the last thing I see when I go to bed," she says. Sherri
Michaud, an Everett, Mass., first-grader, recently wrote in
her diary: "I'm ging to mare Jordan today and Jordan is ging
to mare me. . . ." A drawing of a bride and groom illustrates
the entry.
   Some fans don't even care about the music. Ten-year-old
Becky Garcia, though deaf, is a Kidophile. So are a number of
her hearing-impaired schoolmates at Auburndale Elementary
School in Miami. "They can't hear a plane flying over,"
explains Mary Chojnicki, their teacher. Yet, they hole up in
a room and play New Kids music video tapes full blast. Miss
Garcia recently wrote one of the band members to ask for a
date. "They're cute and they dance good," she says.
   The Kids get 6,000 to 10,000 letters a day from children
barely able to put pen to paper, kids as young as four.
   Admirers go to strange lengths to catch an offstage peek
at the group. The night before the concert in Hoffman
Estates, young fans keep a vigil through the night, alongside
dozing parents, in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency. The New
Kids are guests there.
   At about 1 a.m., 11-year-old Jenny Lebec reaches into the
hotel fountain and splashes water on her face to stay awake.
Moments later, she and three friends scramble out a side
door. They have heard that the New Kids are going out for a
pizza. Waking up, her mom mumbles, "I'm glad this darn group
don't visit Chicago too often."
   The pizza rumor turns out to be false. There is no
sighting.
   When the New Kids are home in Boston, there is a hubbub
there, too. Neighborhood streets attract girls from as far
away as the West Coast. Last February, two 14-year-olds from
Glendale, Calif., lifted their parents' American Express card
and flew to Boston, hoping for a close encounter. In May, two
other runaways from California were found sitting on their
suitcases on Jordan and Jon Knight's front lawn. "They also
had stolen their parents money," reports Sharon Knight, the
boys' sister. "It's kind of weird the way they faint and
swoon," she adds.
   Says Jordan Knight: "I don't mind being a sex symbol to
seven-year-old girls. They probably fantasize holding hands
with me."
