   WASHINGTON -- Substance abuse treatment is no longer a
growth industry.
   After years of brisk expansion, private alcohol and drug
treatment centers are struggling to cope with falling
occupancy rates and pressures to lower their charges. "We
have programs operating at 50% to 60% of capacity and
closing," says Michael Ford, president of the National
Association of Addiction Treatment Providers. In contrast, he
says, during the "boom times" three or four years ago, "it
wasn't unusual for programs to be operating at 80% of
capacity."

   Addiction problems aren't going away. Indeed, the
overcapacity in the private treatment industry, to which
employees with benefits often turn, contrasts sharply with
public treatment centers, used by those without benefits,
where shortages of space produce long waiting lists.
   But employers and insurance companies are clamping down on
the soaring cost of private treatment. The savings realized
by corporations may come at the expense of patients, who are
facing new restrictions on their choices in the kind and
length of care they receive. Therapists complain that limits
on the length of stay are compromising treatment results, but
corporate officials respond that cost control and successful
treatment aren't incompatible.
   Last year the cost of mental health and substance abuse
benefits soared 47% for companies with more than 5,000
employees, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co.,
a benefit consulting firm. Because smaller companies often
offer less generous benefits, the cost to all businesses of
psychiatric and addiction treatment rose by a more modest
18%, the survey shows.
   Fed up with these increases, companies are fighting back.
Many are hiring "utilization review" firms that monitor the
length of treatment and decide when patients are ready to go
home; the firms generally get to keep a share of health-care
savings they find for their clients. Other employers are
setting up "managed care" systems, which prescribe treatment
plans for patients going into therapy.
   Brown &amp; Root Inc., a Houston-based construction subsidiary
of Halliburton Co., saw its costs for mental health and
substance abuse treatment drop $590,000 in this year's first
quarter after it adopted a managed-care plan.
   In the past, the amount of care given often was determined
by the willingness of insurers and employers to pay. Because
insurers paid for up to 28 days of treatment, that became the
industry standard for substance abuse programs. To be sure,
prices for that stay have varied widely; the nonprofit Betty
Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., charges $250 a day,
while an Arizona treatment facility owned by Sierra Tucson
Cos. charges $550 a day. But the four-week duration was
widespread. "There was no individualized treatment," says
Richard Wall, the coordinator of Mobil Corp.'s employee
assistance programs.
   During the 1980s, fueled by generous reimbursement
policies and public concern about drug and alcohol abuse, the
private treatment industry expanded rapidly. "They continued
to build capacity without taking into account managed care
and employers' efforts to control cost," says Michael Cadger
of Foster Higgins.
   But now the industry is scrambling to respond. Most
centers are offering discounts of up to 30% to care managers
who can provide volume business. In the face of corporate
demands for shorter, cheaper inpatient programs, 28-day
programs have become a thing of the past. "The average
inpatient stay now is 17 to 21 days, down from 28 to 30 days
two or three years ago," says the trade group's Mr. Ford. The
shorter stays are supplemented by intensive outpatient
therapy, which allows an employee or a family member to
return to work sooner.
   Marketing efforts are expanding. The Bradford Group, which
owns inpatient treatment centers in Alabama and outpatient
treatment facilities in major cities, has stepped up efforts
to contact managers of employee assistance program about its
substance abuse programs. The company is also working to
tailor treatment programs to the needs -- and budgets -- of
smaller employers that might not ordinarily offer such care.
   In recent years, the private treatment industry has relied
on advertising to attract patients, but some facilities are
changing their ad strategies. Comprehensive Care Corp., a
treatment chain based in St. Louis, has moved most of its
advertising to radio and print from television. The company
is trying to "break out of the clutter," says Laurence
Steudle, a Comprehensive Care senior vice president. "The TV
viewer is confused by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America" public service announcements, as well as ads from
competing treatment centers, he says. In addition, the
company says radio is the best way to reach its most
promising target group -- young, single males.
   The industry also is consolidating. Comprehensive Care has
closed two facilities this year and reduced the number of
beds it owns or manages to 2,735 from 4,096 in 1988. The
occupancy rate in its 15 hospitals has fallen to 30% from 63%
two years ago. The company, which had a loss in the nine
months ended in February of $29.3 million, including a $14.2
million pretax write-down of assets, blames tough
competition, reduced insurance coverage for treatment,
shorter stays and the need to offer price discounts to win
managed care business.
   Earlier this year, St. Luke's Health System in Phoenix
closed an 80-bed inpatient treatment facility in a suburb
where the number of mental health and substance abuse beds
had risen to 432 at the end of last year from 74 in 1985.
   "The market was oversaturated," says Terry Ashoff Johnson,
St. Luke's vice president for marketing. Employers "are
looking at utilization, and they're looking at cost." The
Bradford Group has closed 160 of the 400 beds it opened in
Alabama several years ago. "We see a lot of people bailing
out," says E.N. Burson, Bradford's president.
   Even the Betty Ford Center, the inspiration of the former
first lady, is feeling the impact. Its occupancy rate has
dropped to 90% from 100%, and its four-week waiting list has
evaporated.
   "We're feeling the effect of managed care, definitely,"
says John Schwarzlose, the center's executive vice president.
"Patients who want to come here are told by their insurance
companies that they can't, or patients come here and then are
told by the insurance company that they can't stay for more
than two weeks." Mr. Schwarzlose says managed care often
means accountants are making treatment decisions that should
be left to therapists.
   The treatment industry and some independent analysts worry
that shorter stays will be less successful. The readmission
rate within six months of initial treatment is 15.5% for
inpatient therapy lasting 15 to 24 days, almost twice the
readmission rate after longer stays, according to a study by
Medstat Systems Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich., health-care
information firm.
   "I believe the concept of managed care and cost
containment is good," says the Bradford Group's Mr. Burson.
"It's the implementation that's questionable. There are
incentives based purely on cost-cutting. Patients are being
harmed."
   But advocates of managed care argue that well-structured
plans featuring short inpatient treatment for detoxification
and initial therapy, followed by outpatient sessions, can
both save money and provide effective care. Saul Honigstein,
president of American Psych-Management Inc., a health
consulting company in Arlington, Va., says, "If you do it
right, it may in fact be better care."
   Though treatment centers fret about the push to discharge
patients quickly, some admit that the pressure has forced
them to look for ways to make treatment more efficient. "We
used to let {new patients} just rest for three to five days
and eat well. We spent a lot more time putting patients in a
state of readiness to accept treatment," says Mitzi Carroll,
the executive director of Keystone Treatment Center, a
Canton, S.D., unit of Comprehensive Addiction Programs Inc.,
Vienna, Va. But "we have increased the pressure on the
clinicians to get started right away," she says.
   Keystone, which charges a standard rate of $269 a day,
also says it's giving more free or discounted care to
patients after their insurance runs out. "When it's very
obvious to us that it's too early to discharge the patient,
then the responsibility falls on the patient or on the
treatment center" to continue therapy without insurance, Ms.
Carroll says. "We find it particularly true in our adolescent
population, which we believe very strongly requires longer
treatment."
