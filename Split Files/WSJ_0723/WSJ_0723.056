   NEW YORK -- Control over Manville Corp.'s bankruptcy
reorganization was turned over to U.S. Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in Brooklyn, who has harshly criticized the
financing of the company's asbestos personal-injury trust.
   The decision by Chief Judge Charles Brieant of the federal
Southern District of New York clears up questions over
whether Judge Weinstein has jurisdiction over the trust.
Judge Weinstein touched off a controversy a few weeks ago
when he urged that the trust be refinanced to make up for its
current shortfall of cash.

   The trust, which is independent of the company, was formed
to pay the thousands of asbestos personal-injury claims that
drove Manville into bankruptcy proceedings. Because of its
cash shortfall, however, the trust says it can't pay current
claimants for 15 to 20 years, long after most of the
claimants will have died from the ailments of asbestos
exposure. Asbestos, once widely used as insulation, causes
cancer and respiratory ailments.
   Judge Weinstein earlier this month ordered the trust to
stop paying any settlements until its financing is
restructured. In response, two groups of claimants asked a
federal appeals court to lift Judge Weinstein's freeze,
arguing that he lacked jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case.
   Chief Judge Brieant's order clearly states that questions
arising out of the bankruptcy court plan, which was cleared
in 1986, will be assigned to Judge Weinstein, who has been
handling some 500 asbestos cases against Manville and other
companies. The order also says that Judge Weinstein can seek
changes in the bankruptcy plan, although he wasn't involved
in its creation.
   The Manville trust declined to comment on Judge Brieant's
order. A spokesman for Manville said the company will
continue to work with Judge Weinstein to resolve his concerns
about the trust.
   Judge Weinstein's attack on the trust's financing -- as
well as other asbestos defendants' ability to pay the
thousands of claims against them -- has sparked a debate in
courts across the nation over how to consolidate the cases.
Because the Manville trust's problems are likely to be a
major hurdle to any nationwide settlement, Judge Brieant's
decision establishes a clear avenue for Judge Weinstein to
take on such a major settlement effort.
   At a hearing Friday in federal court in Brooklyn, Judge
Weinstein called for a truce among federal judges staking out
their jurisdiction for a possible asbestos class-action suit.
"There will be no court battles for control of these cases,"
Judge Weinstein said. He said he has contacted federal and
state judges across the country, and that the judges are
moving toward a consensus on how to handle the cases.
   Meanwhile, Chief Judge Thomas Lambros of the federal
Northern District of Ohio issued an order announcing that
judges and attorneys handling asbestos cases across the
country will begin meeting in Washington to organize a
nationwide approach. Judge Lambros ordered a hearing for Nov.
1 in Cleveland on how to consolidate the cases. Last week,
Judge Lambros ordered a national class action for all
asbestos personal-injury suits, but he left unclear how the
order would be implemented.
   At the hearing in Brooklyn, Judge Weinstein said asbestos
plaintiffs' attorney fees also are an obstacle to coming up
with a nationwide plan for settling the cases.
   "We are literally spending billions of dollars on legal
fees and expenses that should be available for the aid and
succor of those injured by asbestos. This waste can't
continue," Judge Weinstein said in an order. The judge said
that at least twothirds of the total amount paid for asbestos
personal-injury claims has gone to litigation costs, mostly
in legal fees.
