   Angeles Corp. said it agreed in principle to acquire for
$30 million a three-year option to buy 22% of its common
stock and other securities from certain former owners of
Quinoco Cos., an oil and gas concern.
   The securities were issued to the former owners as part of
a $50 million acquisition of Quinoco in 1984. Angeles sold
the Quinoco oil and gas businesses and related businesses to
Hallwood Energy Partners of Dallas for about $26 million in
September 1989.
