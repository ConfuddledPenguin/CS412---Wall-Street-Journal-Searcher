   ERFURT, Germany -- A few months ago, this dateline would
have read Erfurt, East Germany, but now "East" is redundant.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl sewed up German reunification last
week at Mikhail Gorbachev's Caucasus retreat by persuading
the Soviet leader to withdraw troops and allow Germany "full
and unrestricted sovereignty." Germans already have begun
trying to awaken their East from its long slumber under
Soviet hegemony.
   Erfurt will need a lot of rousing. Once the thriving
center of the state of Thuringia, it today wears that dull,
dilapidated look communism inflicts. Two Russian soldiers,
with boots neatly shined, lounged in a command car angled
across a street blocked for construction work; the Red Army
has been reduced to traffic duty.

   Near Weimar -- of short-lived Weimar Republic fame --
there is a distant view of what looks like a vast parking lot
for military helicopters. This region for years was a
potential launching pad for a Soviet attack through the
"Fulda gap" into West Germany. Nearby also is Buchenwald,
where Communist guides not long ago were blaming "capitalism"
for Nazi atrocities against the Jews. That the Nazis called
themselves "socialists," not capitalists, was deemed
irrelevant.
   Along a back road, three lads spot our American car and
smilingly flash V-for-Victory salutes. Graffiti scrawled on a
road-construction machine label Karl Marx with a word
unprintable in either German or English. Farther east,
Dresden, firebombed unmercifully by the RAF in World War II
in retaliation for Hitler's Coventry raid, is beginning to
recover its former beauty as long-delayed restoration work
progresses. Southward on the road to Prague, a roadside sign
advertises a "privat restaurant."
   Crossing the Czech border is no problem. Czechoslovakia
doesn't require a visa for Americans. Six years before, when
my wife and I made the same crossing, visas and hotel
vouchers were needed and there was a long wait. We had
watched green-uniformed East German "vopos" training a German
shepherd dog to sink his teeth into the well-padded arm of a
man simulating a motorist -- that is to say, someone like us.
   Clearly, shedding police-state tactics has made East
Germany a kinder, gentler place. West German Social
Democrats, trying to take the edge off Mr. Kohl's triumph,
still wring their hands about the future, warning of mass
unemployment because of the inability of East German
factories to compete with the West.
   But socialists always have trouble understanding the
energizing power of freedom. With all the rebuilding that
needs to be done and all the simple services needed -- such
as cafes and automatic laundries -- East Germany can be an
entrepreneur's paradise if entrepreneurship is allowed free
play. Just give a laid-off factory worker some tools and let
him go to work on Erfurt's plumbing. He will need only a
little practice, materials and economic freedom. The prospect
of earning real deutsche marks, exchangeable for Western
goods of a range and quality only dreamed of a few months
ago, will be sufficient incentive for hard work.
   Certainly there will be problems, such as how to privatize
land and buildings. But Poland next-door already has begun
privatization, demonstrating that what is mainly needed is
the will to begin. Demands for restoration of private
property surely will activate German authorities.
   Of course, the larger question is how the new Germany will
position itself vis-a-vis its North Atlantic Treaty
Organization partners, the European Community and the Soviet
Union. Some Europeans are fearful that Germany will gradually
"move East," as restored sovereignty gives it a political
strength it could not have under four-power supervision. Such
fears were fed, no doubt, by the chummy meeting between Mr.
Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev, and the fact that some of the points
the two agreed to, such as Mr. Kohl's promise that there
would be no nuclear weapons in what is now East Germany,
seemed to have not involved consultation with the NATO
allies. The fact that Germany will be a benefactor to Mr.
Gorbachev in his time of serious financial difficulty -- a
treatment his reasonableness was deemed to merit --
contributes to the sense of a new German-Soviet entente.
   The thought of Germany and the Soviet Union teaming up to
swing their considerable weight in the politics of Europe and
the world does, of course, give pause. Germany is an economic
powerhouse, and the Soviet Union, for all its troubles,
possesses awesome military might, including more than 500,000
troops that have not yet left the soil of its Central
European neighbors. The introduction by Germany of the Soviet
Union into a larger role in the political life of Europe is a
contingency not totally unimaginable.
   But at this point, such thoughts hardly seem worth more
than mild interest. Germany last week formally guaranteed the
borders of Poland, a country that physically separates it
from the Soviet Union. Neither the Poles nor the newly
liberated East Germans have any love for the Russians. It
seems unlikely that warmth toward the Russians would win much
political popularity in either country once fears of
provoking the Russians and their troops subside.
   Even more to the point is the question of exactly what the
words "Soviet Union" will mean in a year or so. If Soviet
chess champion Gary Kasparov is correct, those words will be
history. He predicts that the so-called union will break up
into its separate parts as the Soviet Communist Party loses
its grip on the 15 constituent republics. If that should
happen, Berlin (which may well become the capital of Germany
once more) will be separated from Moscow by still further
barriers. In yet another big story of last week, Ukraine's
Parliament declared national "sovereignty," meaning that the
Ukrainians intend to take charge of many of their own
affairs, including military conscription. Baltic independence
movements are well advanced. Byelorussia, the other republic
along the western tier of the Soviet Union, has people with
aspirations similar to those in Ukraine.
   Germany, and for that matter its partners in NATO and the
EC, will be quite interested in the lands stretching eastward
to the Urals, because they will have little choice. Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary are trying to recover from
communism and are offering opportunities for trade and
investment. The same may be true in the Soviet republics
sooner than expected. Europe has changed dramatically in the
past year, and more big changes are yet to come.
   Driving from the now-unguarded East German border at
Eisenach to Dresden, one gets a sense of that change as a
long-dormant polity stirs with new life. One can only hope
that progress toward peace and democracy continues without
serious interruption and at no slower pace than the one we
have just witnessed.
