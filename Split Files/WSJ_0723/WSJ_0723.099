   Dexter Corp. said it signed an agreement to sell its
Charlotte, N.C., polyvinyl chloride compounding and extrusion
business to Evode Group PLC of Britain.
   The Windsor Locks, Conn., company didn't disclose terms of
the agreement, but said it is expected that the cash sale of
the business, "which is profitable, will result in a capital
gain for Dexter."

   Dexter had said it was in talks for the sale of the
business, which had 1989 sales of about $50 million, but
hadn't named the prospective buyer.
   Dexter said the transaction is subject to completion of
financing arrangements, approval by Evode shareholders, and
various regulatory approvals.
   Evode is a specialty chemical concern.
