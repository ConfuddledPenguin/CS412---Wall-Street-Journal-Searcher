   A major supplier of computer monitors plans next year to
begin selling models that give off sharply reduced amounts of
extremely low frequency, or ELF, electromagnetic emissions.
These emissions, which are produced by standard computer
monitors and many other electrical devices, are considered
hazardous by some medical researchers.
   Sigma Designs Inc., which makes large-screen monitors
generally bought as an upgrade to standard computer
equipment, is the first supplier to pledge to build low-ELF
products. Other companies, notably International Business
Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., announced plans
last year to reduce the amount of very low frequency, or VLF,
emissions, but none has disclosed plans to reduce ELF
emissions.

   The Fremont, Calif., company said it is responding to
pressure from some consumers and health researchers, who
contend that extended exposure to ELF emissions can cause
cancer and other illnesses. Sigma is scheduled to formally
announce its plans today.
   "This is a sign that the computer industry is finally
taking this {ELF} risk very seriously," said Louis Slesin,
editor of VDT News, a bimonthly publication that reports on
health and occupational concerns involving computer monitors.
   While Sigma hopes to capitalize on growing demand for
monitors that emit lower ELF levels, it doesn't plan to
describe the new monitors as safer in its promotional and
advertising materials.
   "We think the data is absolutely indeterminate whether
there is a safety issue or not," said Charlie Waters, Sigma's
vice president of marketing, "so we don't want to add to the
alarm about emissions."
   Nevertheless, Mr. Waters said Sigma is convinced that a
market exists in the U.S. for low-ELF monitors, and he
expects other companies to enter it. "The attention being
given this issue is creating concern," he said. "We believe
that's going to generate demand."
   Already, some makers of personal computers, which ship
most of the monitors sold in the U.S., are coming under fire
for failing to reduce electromagnetic emissions from their
products. In June, for instance, MacWorld, a monthly magazine
devoted to the Macintosh computer brand, began a campaign to
pressure the manufacturer, Apple Computer Inc., into taking
action. So far, Apple has agreed to fund health research on
the question, but it insists that the monitors it ships with
its computers are safe.
   Sigma's new monitors, which will work with the most
popular brands of personal computers, will give off only
about one-tenth of the ELF emissions produced by the
company's current monitors. The new monitors, which will come
in monochrome but not in color, are outfitted with special
circuitry that reduces both ELF and VLF emissions. They will
be priced at $200 more than Sigma's standard monitors, which
range in price from $1,299 to $3,495. The company will begin
selling the low-ELF models in the first quarter of next year.
