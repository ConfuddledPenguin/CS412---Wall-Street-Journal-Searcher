   NEW YORK -- The stock market may soon crown a new king.
   For years, General Electric Chairman Jack Welch dreamed of
the day when GE would become the U.S. company with the
biggest stock market value.

   In 1987, when GE ranked third behind International
Business Machines and Exxon, Mr. Welch exhorted executives of
GE's newly acquired NBC television network to help him scale
the market's heights. "We are $4 billion behind Exxon," Mr.
Welch said then. "If you guys can still get ratings, then
every portfolio manager in the world will have to bet on IBM
-- a one-product company -- or GE. If we can get in that No.
2 position, every portfolio manager in the world will have to
choose between IBM and us."
   Now the 54-year-old Mr. Welch, GE's chairman since 1981,
is on the brink of realizing his dream. Since last December,
GE has moved in and out of the No. 2 position and now is
challenging IBM for the No. 1 ranking.
   At Friday's closing price of 74, GE has a market
capitalization, or stock price times the number of shares
outstanding, of $65.76 billion. IBM, which for decades
reigned unchallenged as the "market cap" champion, is valued
at $67.43 billion, based on Friday's closing price of 117
5/8.
   GE can make up the $1.67 billion difference in market
value if its stock price increases by only $1.88 a share, or
if IBM slips by $2.91 a share. Though it is unlikely that the
town fathers of Fairfield, Conn., GE's headquarters, would
honor Mr. Welch with a ticker-tape parade, GE's surging past
IBM would be akin to winning the World Series for Mr. Welch.
   The stock market value of a company isn't a commonly used
measure of its performance. Investors, understandably, tend
to focus on how far a company's stock price moves, not on the
aggregate value of all its shares. One reason is that a
company's total market value can be increased by actions that
could depress the price of individual shares, such as by
issuing more stock to make an acquisition. Likewise, some
companies have boosted their stock prices by buying back
shares and issuing debt, which reduced their total stock
market values.
   Becoming the stock market's biggest company "is a good
goal, in the sense that it derives from delivering corporate
performance," Martin Sankey, a First Boston analyst, says.
But he warns that simply expanding a company's stock market
value is "not necessarily good for the per-share stock
price."
   Though some of GE's progress toward the market value title
is the result of IBM's sagging stock price, most of it has
come from a steady surge in GE's stock over the past 18
months. During that time, GE's stock price soared 54.7%,
nearly twice the 28.9% rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index. During that same period, IBM's stock price fell
3.6% and Exxon's rose 8.8%.
   Over a 10-year period, GE's stock has outpaced IBM, Exxon
and the broader market. GE's stock price more than quadrupled
from June 1980 to June 1990, rising at an 18.3% annual clip,
according to CDA Investment Technologies Inc. In the same
period, the S&amp;P 500 rose 12.1% annually; Exxon, 11.2%; and
IBM, a scant 7.2%.
   It is impossible to say whether GE will pass IBM. And even
if Mr. Welch wins the market value crown, history shows that
in the stock market, as in Eastern Europe, the mighty can
fall, and fast.
   IBM's market value peaked in 1987 at about $105 billion,
but sank in part because of the October 1987 stock market
crash and because of IBM's lackluster earnings performance
since then. IBM even lost the "biggest market cap" title for
a few months late last year and early this year to Exxon.
Exxon, perhaps not eager to draw attention to itself in the
middle of investigations of the Valdez oil spill in Alaska,
didn't rush to proclaim itself king of the market.
   GE contends that having the biggest stock market value
isn't an enshrined goal -- this might smack of mindless
corporate gigantism or hubris -- but merely a byproduct of
GE's hitting its operating targets, particularly in earnings
and dividend growth. A rise in market capitalization "is
something that happens if you achieve those objectives, not
something you have as a goal," a GE spokesman says. Mr. Welch
declined to comment.
   But evidence abounds that the hard-charging Mr. Welch, who
became known early in his chairmanship as "Neutron Jack" for
closing plants and getting out of businesses where GE
couldn't be No. 1 or No. 2, is keenly aware of GE's market
value ranking and is intent on passing IBM.
   In a letter to shareholders in GE's latest annual report,
for example, Mr. Welch noted that GE ranked 11th among U.S.
companies in market value in 1980, but moved up to second by
the end of the decade. GE's $46 billion increase in market
value in the 1980s, he boasted, "was the largest of any
company in the U.S."
   Mr. Welch has been known to talk up his "market cap"
ambitions in meetings with Wall Street analysts. Russell
Leavitt, a Salomon Brothers analyst, remembers Mr. Welch's
speaking about his hopes of moving GE from No. 3 to No. 1.
But Mr. Leavitt believes that Mr. Welch used the market-value
yardstick "to provide some impression of growth . . . to
suggest that there was more room for upside in the stock."
   GE has a good business reason to maintain a large equity
base and avoid taking on too much debt. GE and its big
financial services unit, GE Capital, both enjoy triple-A
credit ratings. An increase in debt and a corresponding drop
in credit rating would drive up the company's cost of
borrowing.
   A company intent on maximizing its total stock market
value also might avoid buying back its own stock, a common
corporate strategy used to buoy stock prices.
   But in spite of Mr. Welch's desire to power past Exxon and
IBM in terms of total stock market value, GE last year
announced a five-year plan to buy back as much as $10 billion
of its shares. Since then, GE has purchased and retired 22.9
million of its shares at a cost of about $1.5 billion.
   "Mr. Welch is a very competitive individual, and to the
extent that GE's stock price and market capitalization is a
measure of performance, he focuses on it," Mr. Sankey of
First Boston says. "He cares, but he doesn't care so much
that he'd do something stupid. Witness the $10 billion stock
buy-back. If he were entirely focused on market
capitalization, he wouldn't be doing that."
