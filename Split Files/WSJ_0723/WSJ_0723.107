   Beverly Hills, Calif., investor Leonard M. Ross said he
made a proposal to acquire certain hotel and gaming
properties of Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp.
for $46 million.
   In a July 18 letter attached to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, Mr. Ross indicated these assets aren't
among the hotel properties that the company already entered
into an agreement to sell.

   Hotel Investors Trust is a real estate investment trust
based in Los Angeles whose shares are paired for trading with
Hotel Investors Corp., based in San Diego. The companies are
in the process of selling most of their assets following a
falling stock price in the past few years. Hotel Investors
executives didn't return phone calls, nor did Mr. Ross.
   Hotel Investors shares closed 12.5 cents lower at $3.625
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
