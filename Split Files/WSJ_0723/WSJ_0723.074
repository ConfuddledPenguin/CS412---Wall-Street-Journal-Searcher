   Ferranti International PLC said it is cutting 500 jobs in
an effort to cut costs at its U.K. operations.
   The London-based electronics and engineering company said
the move was part of its recovery program. On Thursday, the
company posted a pretax loss of #161.7 million ($293.6
million) for the year ended March 31, mostly arising from the
massive fraud discovered in September 1989 at a subsidiary of
International Signal &amp; Control PLC of the U.S., with which
Ferranti merged in 1987.

   The company said the discovery of three sets of bogus
contracts and subsequent loss of $215 million made Ferranti
overdependent on bank finance. A program of asset disposals
was launched and now the company is "progressing with a clear
strategy and achievable plan for recovery," the company said.
