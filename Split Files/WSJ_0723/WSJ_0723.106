   CONCORD, N.H. -- The New Hampshire Public Utilities
Commission has unanimously approved the bankruptcy
reorganization plan for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire
under which the utility will be acquired by Northeast
Utilities for about $2.3 billion.
   The proposed reorganization plan has already been approved
by shareholders, creditors, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manchester. Northeast Utilities has been managing PS New
Hampshire since April 30.

<TEXT>
   The reorganization plan still requires the approval of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   The New Hampshire commission said parties to its
proceedings have 20 days to request reconsideration of its
decision and the commission then has 10 days to respond. If
the commission denies requests for reconsideration, the
parties then have 30 days to appeal to the state supreme
court.
