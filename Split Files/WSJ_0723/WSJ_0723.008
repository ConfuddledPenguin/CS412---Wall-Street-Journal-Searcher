   The name of John O'Brien, who resigned suddenly last week
as chairman of Grumman Corp., has arisen in a federal inquiry
into Pentagon contracting fraud, although he isn't believed
to be a target of the probe.
   Before his abrupt resignation, Mr. O'Brien became
embroiled in the federal criminal investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud and corruption involving Long Island-based
companies, according to defense and law-enforcement
officials. The grand jury inquiry began in Uniondale, N.Y.,
more than a year ago, according to these officials, but in
the past few months investigators stepped up their interest
in Mr. O'Brien and his activities.

   Prosecutors have questioned witnesses and collected
documents related to his involvement with the late James
Kane, a Long Island businessman who helped run a
now-disgraced political lobbying group representing area
defense firms.
   Other individuals associated with Mr. Kane funneled
thousands of dollars of illegal campaign contributions to
various lawmakers during the 1980s, according to
investigators and court documents filed by the government.
Messrs. O'Brien and Kane were friends, according to
law-enforcement officials, and prosecutors are trying to
determine whether Mr. O'Brien had a role in the operation of
the lobbying group, called Long Island Aerospace Political
Action Committee.
   Mr. Kane's name originally surfaced two years ago as part
of a broader Alexandria, Va., grand jury investigation of
Pentagon bribery and influence-peddling. A search warrant
issued at the time for one of Mr. Kane's companies asked for
material "pertaining to schemes" to "extort campaign
contributions" from certain defense contractors. Federal
agents also sought documents "relating to the ownership of
stock certificates" or other "things of value" that may have
been given to public officials by one of Mr. Kane's companies
or associates.
   Federal investigators, among other things, are now trying
to determine whether Mr. O'Brien, members of his family or
other current or former Grumman officials received loans or
other benefits from Mr. Kane or his firms, according to law
enforcement officials. A member of the law firm representing
Grumman declined to comment.
   In May, a former shipping manager at Grumman's aerospace
unit pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the
government by submitting to the Pentagon $300,000 of bogus
bills submitted by a subcontractor controlled by Mr. Kane.
The former Grumman manager is cooperating with prosecutors.
   Previously, Grumman has maintained that it isn't a target
of either grand jury investigation. Company spokesmen on
Friday declined to comment on the matter.
   Meanwhile, Grumman's new chairman said the Bethpage, N.Y.,
maker of jet fighters won't change course. Renso L. Caporali
said his first priority is "to try to convince everyone that
the change at Grumman is not so radical." Mr. Caporali, who
also succeeds Mr. O'Brien as chief executive officer and
president, said he plans "a continuation of the agenda that
my predecessor was pushing so hard" at Grumman.
   Topping that agenda is an effort to reduce Grumman's size
in line with decreasing defense spending. "The downward
pressure (in defense spending) is going to be on everyone (in
the industry) and the only way to deal with it is to get
yourself into fighting trim," Mr. Caporali said. Last month,
Grumman announced it would offer early-retirement incentives
to 6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, to cut costs.
   Grumman's announcement of the management change said that
Mr. Caporali will serve in his new duties while the board
considers other candidates for the positions, both from
inside and outside the company. However, the new chairman
said "I hope to stay in the job permanently." Mr. Caporali,
the former vice chairman, technology, said the likely inside
candidates would be Grumman's other vice chairman, Robert G.
Freeze, and the heads of the major divisions.
   Mr. Caporali said he first learned he would be assuming
the company's leadership a week before the announcement.
