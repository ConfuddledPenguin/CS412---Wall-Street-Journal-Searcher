   If you are thinking of investing in the "hot" market for
new stock issues, you had better be quick about it.
   Initial public offerings are rolling briskly off the Wall
Street assembly line. Seven new stocks made their debuts last
week alone. Four arrived on Thursday, a day when IPOs were a
rare bright spot in a bleak over-the-counter market. Many
IPOs are up sharply in price this year.

   But investors who jump on the new-issues bandwagon now
might be wise to jump off in a matter of hours, warns Robert
Natale, editor since 1983 of Standard &amp; Poor's Emerging &amp;
Special Situations newsletter. Increasingly, he says, IPOs
are surging in price on their first trading day, but failing
to follow through with longer-term gains.
   "In the beginning of the year, you could buy an IPO in the
immediate aftermarket and still expect a very good return
over the next three months," he says. "Now, much of the
performance is compressed into the first day."
   To Mr. Natale and others, the pattern is ominous because
it suggests the IPO market may be overheating. Now that the
pace of new stock offerings has revived from a two-year
torpor following the 1987 crash, it is getting more important
for investors to be cautious, investment advisers say.
   The quality of companies that went public earlier in the
year is widely praised by analysts and portfolio managers.
Some, such as John W. Ballen, director of research for
Massachusetts Financial Services, say they don't see any
signs of deteriorating standards as the pace of new offerings
quickens. "It's been surprising how good the quality has
been," he says.
   Others, however, say it is getting harder for investors to
do the careful spade work needed to pick winning IPOs.
   "When there's only one deal a week, it's easy to do your
homework," says Roger McNamee, co-manager of T. Rowe Price
Associates' New Horizon Fund. "When there's one deal a day,
it gets much tougher. When there's more than one deal a day,
it's impossible . . . you have sellers and buyers who aren't
well prepared."
   A total of 115 companies, excluding investment funds, have
entered the public market so far this year, up from 95 a year
earlier, according to Securities Data Co. The offerings have
reaped proceeds of $3.76 billion, up from $3.06 billion a
year earlier.
   Trading prices for new offerings have soared, far
surpassing the stocks of older companies. The IPO 100 Index
-- which measures the average price change in shares of the
most recent 100 new issues -- rose 18.7% through July 11,
compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index in the same
period.
   That is the highest level for the index since Feb. 4,
1987, according to the IPO Reporter. The strong performance
is proof that the companies going public this year are
high-quality, says Mr. Ballen. But Mr. Natale still worries
about those big price gains now seen in the first day of
trading. A first-day rise of 5% to 10% generally is expected,
he explains. But gains much higher than that can wipe out
longer-term returns.
   Shares of the last 10 IPOs recommended for purchase by Mr.
Natale rose an average 16% on the first day of trading, but
then gained only 3.3%, he says. That pattern provides little
incentive for investors to buy shares after the first day of
trading, he adds, particularly because newly public stocks
typically underperform the market after the first three
months of trading.
   So Mr. Natale says he has been issuing more "flip"
recommendations. That is, he is advising institutional
clients to buy stocks in the initial offering and sell them
within a few days, rather than wait and buy after the first
trading day.
   Among the pending IPOs he is recommending as "quick flips"
are the retail jeweler Crescent Jewelers, restaurant concern
O'Charley's, and Ikos Systems, a computer concern. For the
longer term, he suggests investors buy the initial offering
of Allied Clinical Laboratories under $14 a share. The
operator of regional clinical labs is expected to go public
soon at $12 to $14 a share.
   Many investment advisers dislike Mr. Natale's approach.
Mr. Ballen, for example, says he doesn't subscribe to
"flipping." And the technique isn't generally recommended for
smaller investors by the Institute for Econometric Research,
the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., publisher of New Issues
newsletter.
   Of the seven IPOs recommended for purchase this year by
New Issues, none have been for short-term holdings, says
senior analyst Allan Hadhazy. Mr. Hadhazy agrees that
first-day prices seem to have heated up in recent weeks. But
he says he is still finding some good companies for smaller
investors among the large backlog of pending IPOs in
registration.
   Recently, New Issues advised purchase of Failure Group at
$15 a share or below. A consulting firm that has investigated
and analyzed disasters since 1967, Failure Group is expected
to go public in early August at $13 to $16 a share. He calls
Crescent Jewelers fairly priced, but not an outstanding value
unless it were priced at $8 to $9 a share, instead of the $10
to $12 planned.
   Mr. Hadhazy called four other pending IPOs overpriced:
O'Charley's; Mayor's, a Florida jewelry retailer scheduled to
go public for later this month at $9 to $12 a shares; Marcam,
a maker of computer software, due to go public at $13 to $15
in early August; and Bird Medical Technology, a maker of
respiratory and other medical equipment set for an IPO later
this month at $7.50 to $9.50 a share.
   To portfolio managers such as Edwin B. Powell, IPO prices
now seem steep. As manager of a value-oriented small-stock
portfolio for Provident Capital Management of Philadelphia,
Mr. Powell says he believes prices are creeping up as
companies "succumb to the temptation of a higher price rather
than a satisfied, long-term investor relationship."
   Although he has participated in 19 IPOs this year, Mr.
Powell says it's getting tougher for him to find offerings
that meet his criteria. He will invest only in stocks that
trade at significant discounts to the multiples of the
overall market and comparable companies. For instance, he
said he looked at Bird Medical "for a second." It is expected
to go public at 31 to 40 times the 24 cents a share earned by
the company on a pro-forma basis for the 12 months ended
March 31, according to New Issues.
   Mr. McNamee at T. Rowe Price says he is seeing some
proposals that wouldn't have crossed his desk earlier this
year. For instance, he just received a prospectus for a
proposed $5-a-share offering underwritten by a company that
is being investigated both by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the state of Florida.
   "You're starting to see the fleas as well as the dog," he
says.
   At its recent pace, he suggests the IPO market will have
to "slow down or get ugly. It's already getting junkier."
   It just might slow down, at least temporarily, suggests
one of this year's busier investment bankers. "Historically,
you get a break in August" when a number of potential
investors are on vacation, explains Alexander Daigneault,
managing director of capital markets for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons,
Baltimore. Mr. Daigneault's department has been one of this
year's top underwriters, taking three companies public on
June 29 alone.
   However, he notes that a number of companies have
registered their initial offerings with the SEC. The pace, he
says, promises to pick up again after Labor Day.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Over-the-counter stocks buckled again under the weight of
more bad news from the technology sector.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.90 to 455.27, a 0.63%
decline. Volume eased to 174.6 million shares from 182.6
million shares Thursday.
   Technology shares came under pressure after
exchange-listed Storage Technology said demand for its
disk-drive products was lower than planned and Texas
Instruments, also on the New York Stock Exchange, gave a
bleak profit outlook late in the day.
   The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which includes many OTC
technology stocks, dropped 4.63, or 0.93%, to 491.96. The
index is down 3.65% since closing at a high Monday of 510.61.
The broader Nasdaq Composite Index lost 2.8% for the week.
   Intel, the OTC market's biggest technology stock, slid 2
5/8 to 45 1/8 after Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette removed the
issue from its list of stocks recommended for purchase. The
brokerage firm downgraded the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor maker to "moderately attractive" from "buy."
   Among other technology shares, Sun Microsystems sagged 1
3/4 to 32 1/4, Conner Peripherals lost 2 to 27 3/4, Novell
tumbled 3 1/2 to 50 3/4 and Quantum slid 1/2 to 23 3/8.
   One Price Clothing Stores rose 2 3/4 to 18. Late Thursday,
the Duncan, S.C., specialty clothing store reported that net
income for the second quarter rose to 43 cents a share from
27 cents a share a year earlier.
