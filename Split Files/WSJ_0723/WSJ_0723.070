   A federal judge in Santa Ana, Calif., sentenced Janet Faye
McKinzie to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of
dollars from North America Savings &amp; Loan Association, a
now-insolvent Orange County thrift.
   Ms. McKinzie, a 41-year-old former business manager and
executive consultant for the thrift's late president, also
was ordered to pay $13.4 million in restitution to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

   Ms. McKinzie was ordered Friday by Judge Alicemarie H.
Stotler to begin serving her prison term immediately. Ms.
McKinzie's attorney, Richard "Racehorse" Haynes of Texas,
filed a notice of appeal at the sentencing hearing, said
David Schindler, one of the two assistant U.S. attorneys who
prosecuted the case. Neither Ms. McKinzie nor her attorney
could be reached.
   After an eight-week trial, a jury found Ms. McKinzie
guilty in March of stealing $15.5 million from North America
Savings. She was convicted on 22 criminal counts, including
racketeering, conspiracy, wire and bank fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property.
   Federal banking and thrift regulators say the sentence was
among the toughest ever levied for fraud. Last month, Woody
Lemons was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in
defrauding a Texas thrift. That sentence also is being
appealed.
   "The government considers the sentence to be appropriate
in light of the egregious misconduct of McKinzie," the two
prosecutors said in a statement. The demise of North America
Savings is expected to eventually cost taxpayers $118
million.
   Ms. McKinzie had pleaded innocent because of insanity. Her
attorneys had argued that her judgment was impaired by
prescription drugs she was taking.
   Duayne D. Christensen, a Westminster, Calif., dentist,
invested $6.4 million to open the thrift in 1983. Ms.
McKinzie was a consultant to Dr. Christensen in operating the
thrift. In 1986, the concern lost $8.9 million in the first
11 months. Government prosecutors charged that the two lived
a lavish life style, using thrift funds to buy Rolls-Royce
autos, a $125,000 gold eagle statue and an $18,500 gold
letter-opener.
   In 1987, a week before federal regulators declared the
thrift insolvent, Dr. Christensen, 57 years old, died when
his Jaguar crashed into a freeway overpass. The Orange county
coroner classified the cause of his death as undetermined,
failing to rule whether it was an accident or suicide.
   Federal regulators have also filed a civil suit seeking
$40 million for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in
the case, an FDIC attorney said. "This sentencing was a very
gratifying victory, but it could also speed things up in our
civil case," he said.
