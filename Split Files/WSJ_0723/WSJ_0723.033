   WASHINGTON -- The emerging market economies of Eastern
Europe offer rich commercial opportunities for Western
companies. But U.S. government penny-pinching and interagency
rivalries are restraining U.S. businesses' chances.
   Hamstrung by budget restraints, the U.S. government isn't
adding sufficient new staff at its embassies in Eastern
Europe to handle the flood of inquiries from U.S. businesses
seeking information about these markets. The Commerce
Department's foreign commercial service, which provides
economic officers at many overseas U.S. posts, has only one
officer each in Budapest, Warsaw and Bucharest, along with a
handful of people hired locally. Next year's budget provides
for only one new officer in each of these capitals.

   The State Department says the only way it can add
diplomats in Eastern Europe is by reducing its staff in
Western Europe. It plans to reassign 39 State Department
officers and 47 foreign employees to Eastern Europe. But,
officials concede, the department is being forced to stretch
itself thin just as Western Europe is preparing for economic
union in 1992, an event that will create the need for a
greater U.S. presence.
   "This is the way to save money and become a third-rate
economic power simultaneously," complains Rep. Sam Gejdenson
(D., Conn.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade.
   Willard Workman, director of International Policy and
Programs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adds that many
businesses, while reluctant to complain publicly, already are
hampered by inadequate resources at U.S. embassies. He says
that in January a group of U.S. business executives in
Warsaw, "had to line up to see the only commercial officer we
have there. The officer was so busy he couldn't leave his
office. As a result, he was forced to give them information
that was dated because he was unable to get out and keep tabs
on the local market."
   At the same time, old turf battles between the State and
Commerce Departments are exacerbating these problems. In
1980, Congress, concerned that the State Department wasn't
focusing on U.S. business's problems, transferred the
agency's commercial operations to the Commerce Department,
creating the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. Ever since,
Foggy Bottom has sought to undercut what it views as a rival
overseas.
   Last February, for instance, the Commerce Department
decided to send officers to train officials in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to set up a new export-control system. But the
State Department refused to grant travel authority to the
Commerce Department personnel. The State Department relented
several months later, but only after being sharply criticized
by a congressional subcommittee.
   The status-conscious State Department also fought
unsuccessfully against a measure in the 1988 trade bill that
allows the Commerce Department's foreign commercial service
officers to attain the rank of minister-counselor, which had
been reserved for foreign service officers.
   When U.S. business executives travel abroad, they often
prefer to deal with Commerce Department personnel. Laura
Gubisch, director of export activities at the American
Association of Exporters and Importers, says, "the State
Department just doesn't have as its primary focus getting
American goods into a foreign market."
   In a letter supporting a bill that would set up regional
commercial centers to aid American business, the group urged
that these centers be located "wherever possible, apart from
U.S. embassies."
   The American Foreign Service Association, which represents
State Department foreign service officers, proposed recently
that the department establish a foreign service reserve
composed of retired officers. To reduce federal costs, these
retirees would be used as consultants on a temporary basis as
needed. At a meeting last Thursday, State Department
officials said they had some problems with the plan,
including that a reserve system would make the foreign
service look too much like the military. But they said they
were willing to ponder the suggestion.
   But U.S. business is growing impatient. "We're talking
about great economic and commercial opportunities that nobody
is able to gauge," says Mr. Workman of the Chamber of
Commerce. "It seems to me at a minimum we need in a hurry to
do things that help us find out as much as we can about the
economies of these countries."
