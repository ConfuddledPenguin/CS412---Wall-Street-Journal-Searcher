   When was the last time you were really excited about an
election? For most Americans it was long ago. This fall
two-thirds of potential voters will stay home. More and more
people no longer feel they can affect the political process
on the national level. Many Americans seem to think that
inside the Beltway is alien territory as remote from everyday
life as Mars.
   Benjamin Ginsberg and Martin Shefter, two Cornell
University political scientists, say there is a good reason
for this political alienation. In "Politics by Other Means:
The Declining Importance of Elections in America" (Basic
Books, 226 pages, $19.95), they argue persuasively that
America is entering a "post-electoral" political order in
which most elections already have been decided before the
polls open. The average House incumbent won 73.5% of the vote
in 1988. This year, one in four House members will be
unopposed by a major-party candidate, as will four senators.

   Politicians increasingly are uninterested in engaging
voters directly. They spend their time building up a vast
array of incumbent protections designed to squeeze out
political competition. Incumbents and the interest groups
that back them find it easier to decide public policy not in
elections but through hand-to-hand combat in the Capitol. The
weapons of choice are no longer ballots, but congressional
inquiries, media revelations and judicial proceedings. The
authors call the most common tactic RIP: revelation,
investigation and prosecution.
   Through the use of such tactics as RIP, political players
who don't stand for election (journalists, prosecutors and
pressure groups) often can end the careers of politicians
with a much broader political base. Democratic House Speaker
Jim Wright and GOP Gov. Evan Mecham of Arizona both recently
were ousted from office by extra-electoral means.
   There's not much room for the average voter in these new
arenas of political conflict. Increasingly sidelined by the
real political struggles, it isn't surprising that most
voters don't vote.
   Messrs. Ginsberg and Shefter see a future in which both
conservatives and liberals will focus more of their efforts
away from winning votes and toward strengthening the
institutions they control while undermining those dominated
by their opponents. For Republicans, that means the White
House, which they have occupied for 26 of the last 38 years.
For Democrats, it means building up the power of Congress,
which they have completely controlled for 30 of the past 38
years.
   Already there are signs this is happening. Republicans
have tried to use their control of the executive branch to
centralize control of regulatory and tax policy in the White
House. A slowdown in government spending has weakened the
urban political machines that mobilized voters for Democratic
candidates. In addition, over the past 15 years there has
been a tenfold increase in the number of indictments brought
by federal prosecutors against local officials, mostly
Democrats. Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry is the most
visible recent example.
   The Democratic Congress in turn has turned RIP into a
major vehicle for political attacks against the executive
branch. In 1978, Democrats institutionalized the process by
adopting the Ethics in Government Act, which virtually
mandates the use of special prosecutors to investigate
executive-branch officials. Congress, of course, chose not to
impose the same rules upon its own members and staff.
   The extent to which the RIP process has become ingrained
is seen in the ethical controversy that surrounded Reagan
aides Ed Meese and Anne Gorsuch. It automatically was assumed
that Congress would hold lengthy hearings and that a special
prosecutor would be called in. The authors note, "This
procedure is really quite remarkable: Officials who in other
democracies would merely be compelled to resign from office
are threatened with criminal prosecution in the United
States."
   Congress also has tried increasingly to micromanage
executive-branch agencies. Half of the Democratic House
members now chair subcommittees overseeing the executive
branch, and the size of committee staffs has more than
tripled since the 1960s. These committees have all but taken
charge of running various government agencies, including the
Legal Services Corporation. As the authors make plain, the
separation of powers is being replaced "by the emergence of a
plural executive."
   The authors aren't optimistic that the decay of political
competition and greater voter apathy can be halted. They hope
one of the two parties will seek to mobilize new voters and
thus end electoral deadlock by making elections once again
mandates for political change.
   In fact, neither party is likely to take that risk, but
there may be other ways to bring people back into the
political system. Voters have placed a bumper crop of
initiatives on state ballots this year as a way of overcoming
political gridlock. The campaign to limit congressional terms
is showing surprising life, and even if it fails it could
force incumbents to once again pay attention to the wishes of
those the Founders intended to be the major actors in
American politics: the citizens.
