   Rio Algom Ltd. said it plans to close two of its uranium
mines at the beginning of September, as much as nine months
sooner than the Toronto mining company had indicated.
   Rio Algom, which is 52%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain,
said the closures of the Quirke and Panel mines in Elliot
Lake, Ontario, will eliminate about 1,700 of the company's
work force of 5,000. A third mine in the area will continue
to produce uranium under a long-term contract with
provincially owned Ontario Hydro.

   Rio Algom had said in January it planned to shut the two
mines in the first half of 1991 because of low ore grades and
depressed uranium market prices. A Rio Algom spokesman said
the closure date was advanced after agreements were reached
with customers to reduce the amount of uranium contracted.
