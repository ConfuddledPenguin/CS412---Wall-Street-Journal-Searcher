   MECA Software Inc. turned out to be investor-friendly in
its initial public offering.
   The Westport, Conn., producer of software aimed at helping
individuals and small businesses manage their taxes and legal
affairs sold 1,750,000 shares Thursday at $10 apiece. The
offering immediately surged to a premium, trading as high as
$13.25 the first day on volume of 1,754,700 shares, closing
at $12.25.

   MECA closed Friday at $11.75 in over-the-counter trading
on volume of 427,600 shares, giving the company's 4.68
million shares an indicated market value of about $55
million.
   Most of the company's revenue comes from two software
packages, Andrew Tobias Managing Your Money, designed in part
by financial writer Andrew Tobias, and Andrew Tobias TaxCut,
with help from Mr. Tobias and tax attorney Daniel Caine. The
company also markets and is developing other products.
   The underwriters, Needham &amp; Co., Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc.
and Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, had estimated in the
preliminary prospectus in early June that the offering would
be priced at $7.50 to $9.50 a share.
   In the offering, the company sold one million shares,
saying it will use the funds for marketing, product
development and working capital. In addition, two founders
and two other investors sold 750,000 shares, with an
additional 270,000 overallotment. Prior to the offering,
Hambro International Venture Funds and Palmer Organization
III L.P. each held a 32.6% interest; Daniel M. Schley,
president and chief executive officer, 27.2%; and Garner W.
Lester, executive vice president, 7.6%.
   If the holders sell all one million shares, Hambro's
interest would decline to 18.5%; Palmer, to 19.6%; Mr.
Schley, to 15%; and Mr. Lester, to 4.2%.
   The company's revenue has surged, from $6.4 million in
fiscal 1988 to $11 million in fiscal 1989 and $17.3 million
for the nine months ended March 31; the latter period
included $5.4 million in revenue from a joint marketing
arrangement with International Business Machines Corp., which
included copies of MECA software as part of the sale of
certain personal computers. Net income totaled $11,000 in
fiscal 1988, $468,000 in fiscal 1989, and $1.2 million in the
most recent nine months.
