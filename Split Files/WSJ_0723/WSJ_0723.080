   In reference to your June 19 page-one article "Earth
First] Group Manages to Offend Nearly Everybody," I find it
amusing that everyone is so shocked and sanctimonious about
how we mustn't destroy private property, e.g., bulldozers,
trucks, etc., while our national property -- the ancient
forests -- is being systematically destroyed by those who
hide behind those very property rights and free enterprise.
Entire civilizations have died because they abused their
forests, land and water. Now, our ancient forests are being
destroyed. By the time the system gets around to saving the
ancient forests, there won't be any left.
   Earth First] would be rendered unnecessary if we would all
join together to save our ancient forests.

   Contrary to your story, Earth First] is not a "burden and
an embarrassment" to all in the "genteel" environmental
movement. Here's Brock Evans, vice president of the
mainstream National Audubon Society, as quoted in the Los
Angeles Times Magazine: "I honor Earth First] for having the
guts to do the things they do. It's not for me, but I
understand why they do what they do. And, ultimately, we all
help each other."

   Your article wasn't the first on the subject that doesn't
excuse militant environmentalists' behavior as a justifiable
means to a noble end. While you reported that the Sierra Club
and National Wildlife Federation have denounced Earth First]
as "the moral equivalent of outlaws," this fact has been
minimized or ignored.
   Lawlessness, even under the protective umbrella of "saving
the planet," must not go unpunished. The destroyers and their
tacit consenters do little more than discourage new recruits
for mainstream environmental groups. Some of us just might
retreat to the closet rather than appear as though we
sympathize, through indirect association, with a bunch of
madmen.

   Doug Bandow's June 20 editorial-page article appropriately
criticized the concepts of ecoterrorism currently espoused by
Earth First] and obviously practiced widely by irresponsible
people. I strongly agree that such ecoterrorism must be
denounced by true environmentalists, those of us who use and
produce forest products, as well as protectionists who use
forest products but wish to deny forest-products producers
access to raw materials.
   But I do object to Mr. Bandow's assertion that
"government-subsidized timbering . . . is both
environmentally destructive and wasteful. . . ." That is
irresponsible and generally untrue.
   I earn my living producing forest products. Much of the
timber is purchased from state and federal forests. When
properly managed, such renewable resources are grown and
harvested as a cyclical crop that benefits wildlife,
recreationists, hunters, the atmosphere, the watershed and
many other interests as well as the forest-products industry.
Such use of public timber doesn't strike me as wasteful, and,
if properly managed for multiple-use objectives, it is not
subsidized.
