   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc., in an effort to pump new
life into its 54-year-old Life magazine, is considering
converting the monthly to a weekly and overhauling its
editorial content, including a switch to standard magazine
size.
   According to magazine unit staffers, a team of about 20
editors, writers, and designers have already produced two
"dummy" editions of a weekly Life this month and are at work
on a third. The dummy issues have had favorable reactions
from top editors of Time Inc. Magazine Co., one company
insider said.

   Time Warner executives in recent months have played down
reports of a change in the monthly Life, except to say a
small task force of editors was studying a range of options
for the venerable magazine. "The task force is not at a
critical point," a magazine group spokesman said. "We are a
long way from a decision or even holding it up for a
decision."
   Activity surrounding the project has increased in recent
weeks, however. Since the production of two editions, on July
2 and July 16, Jason McManus, Time Inc. editor in chief, is
said to have shown enormous interest in the plan.
   The pace accelerated this month after Life Managing Editor
James Gaines presented the second dummy of the weekly version
of the magazine to Mr. McManus, as well as to Editorial
Director Richard Stolley and Corporate Editor Gilbert Rogin.
The next issue, which is to have an Aug. 6 cover date, will
include a column from Roger Rosenblatt, Life's editor at
large, as well as real news photos from free-lance
photographers and deadline news and feature stories from
staff writers.
   Mr. Gaines, who made his name increasing newsstand sales
of People magazine, is spending most of his time on the Life
project, while Jay Lovinger, Life's assistant managing
editor, runs the monthly. In the last year, Mr. Gaines has
beefed up Life's staff by recruiting such writers and editors
as Mr. Rosenblatt, former editor of U.S. News &amp; World Report;
Daniel Okrent, founding editor of New England Monthly
magazine; and Adam Moss, founding editor of the defunct 7
Days.
   The debt-laden Time Warner is spending millions to launch
another weekly, Entertainment Weekly, whose founding editor
recently resigned after the magazine's troubled start. There
has been some speculation that Entertainment Weekly and Life
might somehow be merged. Life, once a cornerstone of the
company, has seen its circulation flatten out at 1.7 million,
while ad pages dipped 14% in the first half of 1990. The
magazine currently publishes 12 monthly issues and two extra
issues with special themes.
   Life has been down this road before. Less than two years
ago, another task force, led by former Life managing editor
Patricia Ryan, investigated the idea of Life as a weekly. Ms.
Ryan favored the weekly idea but, at the time, Mr. McManus
thought it would cannibalize circulation of Time Inc.'s other
mass-market weeklies, Time and People. Ms. Ryan subsequently
clashed with Mr. McManus, was fired, and Mr. Gaines appointed
to lead Life.
   The new Life envisioned by Mr. Gaines is the size of Time
magazine, not the oversized dimensions of the current Life.
Dummy versions used the familiar Life logo and had 12 to 14
pages of photographs with captions at the front of the
magazine, followed by news and feature stories. The new Life
has some similarities with the editorial style of Mr. Moss's
7 Days.
   The magazine's size is one of the top concerns of the task
force. Publishing a weekly magazine at Life's current size
could represent a "prohibitive cost," one company executive
said. And advertisers might resist paying premium rates for
the larger page size on a weekly basis, particularly during
the industry wide slump in ad spending.
   Something that could help the weekly version of the
magazine succeed is the Life name itself. "Life has a
tremendous franchise," said Charles Elbaum, president of
Publishing Economics Inc., a magazine consultant. "But in the
current environment I can't believe anyone would launch a
weekly. The budget for a weekly would have to be huge."
   Though a decision on changing Life is not expected soon,
it is regarded as a crucial one for the company by some
staffers. If the magazine becomes a weekly and fails, "there
is no going back to a monthly," said one company editor.
"Life's name is still on the Time &amp; Life Building. It would
be a great embarrassment if they didn't get it right."
