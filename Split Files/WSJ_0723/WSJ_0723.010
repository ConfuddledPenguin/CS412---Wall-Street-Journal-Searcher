   NEW YORK -- Four investors here are seeking a controlling
interest in Polifly Financial Corp., the New Milford, N.J.,
holding company for Polifly Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group,
which holds 9.99% of Polifly, said it proposed acquiring
control by buying new shares from the company. The proposal,
outlined in a May 29 letter to the company, is subject to
negotiation and discussions and may be modified or abandoned,
the filing said.

   The group, which hasn't obtained the financing needed to
buy a controlling interest, also plans to ask Polifly for
representation on the board, the filing said.
   The investors are Haralambos S. Kostakopoulos, chairman of
Hsky Inc., a bank-advisory firm; Nicola Biase, a financial
consultant and U.S. representative of Findim Investments S.A.
of Massagno, Switzerland, which has financial and other
interests; Emmanuel M. Kontokosta, a general partner and
engineer at Kontokosta Associates; and Nikos Mouyiaris,
president of Mana Products Inc., a cosmetics manufacturer.
   Hsky and Kontokosta are in Manhattan; Mana is in Long
Island City, N.Y. Findim, which has an office in Manhattan,
is a subsidiary of Findim S.p.A., Milan.
   The investors acquired the shares of Polifly between June
27 and July 13 at $1.50 to $2.28 a share. Polifly shares
closed Friday at $2.19, up 19 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading.
   Polifly has had financial problems. This year it signed an
agreement with federal thrift regulators substantially
restricting its activities. The bank also is bringing in new
managers: Last month, it named Joseph S. Paparatto president
and chief executive officer, and this month, Frederick T.
Muller, who had been acting chief executive, resigned as
chairman.
   Mr. Paparatto, who assumed the chairmanship as well on
July 11, says the filing is under review but declined further
comment.
