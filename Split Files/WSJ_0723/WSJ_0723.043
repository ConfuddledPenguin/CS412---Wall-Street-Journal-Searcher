   DENVER -- OEA Inc. said the Colorado Department of Health
filed a suit in state court claiming the automotive and
aerospace maker violated the Colorado Hazardous Waste Act.
   The suit asks for an injunction prohibiting OEA from
generating any hazardous waste until the state agency
believes that OEA is in compliance with the department's
regulations.

   OEA said it asked the court for a stay of any injunction
and has temporarily discontinued production at its Denver
facility until the injunction request is heard and decided.
