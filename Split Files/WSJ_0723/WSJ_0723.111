   Maho AG of West Germany, a machine tools maker, said sales
for the year ended June 30 rose 35% to 710 million marks
($432.7 million), citing acquisitions of new operations and
good domestic and foreign demand. Maho didn't disclose
profit.
   The parent company's fiscal 1990 sales rose 24% to 535
million marks. Maho said fiscal second-half profit exceeded
that for the first half, but it didn't give details. It said
that fiscal 1991 sales are expected to rise, but at a
somewhat slower pace, and that earnings will improve.

   In the opening of East European markets, Maho has
established a 50-50 joint-production venture with Szim, a
Hungarian engineering company, and wants to increase its
holding in the venture to 65%.
