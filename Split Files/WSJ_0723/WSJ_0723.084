   BEIJING -- Chinese and Soviet officials signed agreements
to protect investment in each other's countries and avoid
double taxation for their nationals, the official Xinhua News

Cooperation Committee. Xinhua said Chinese Vice Premier Yao
Yilin and his Soviet counterpart, U.D. Maslukov, signed a
memorandum but its contents and details of the other accords
