   CALABASAS, Calif. -- The Navy accused Lockheed Corp. of
defaulting on its contract for the P-7 anti-submarine
aircraft and terminated the project, after the company
refused to accept production losses that it says could have
exceeded $300 million.
   Lockheed already has taken one writedown of that size to
reflect miscalculations it made on the development of the
plane. Had it gone ahead with production under the Navy's
terms, it would have encountered another deficit "comparable
to or more than" the earlier charge, Lockheed Chairman Daniel
Tellep said.

   "We didn't ask for a bailout on development, but we
weren't going to take losses on production," Mr. Tellep said
in an interview. "I had to be firm on that."
   The Navy's action, which scuttles the $600 million
development pact and deprives Lockheed of a major project
that ultimately could have been valued at as much as $5
billion for 123 aircraft, is one of the harshest of its kind
ever initiated against a contractor. It overshadows, for
example, the 1985 cancellation of the $4 billion Sergeant
York tank-gun program with Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace unit.
   Under a termination for default, the government compels a
contractor to pay for all expenses associated with ending a
program. But Mr. Tellep guaranteed that the $300 million
reserve taken earlier would cover all such obligations on the
P-7. "If the default is sustained, we will have no more
write-offs," he said.
   The Navy also can opt to bring in another company to build
the plane and then make Lockheed pay for any additional costs
that arise from the switch. But Mr. Tellep said: "We've been
given assurances from very high-level people in the Navy that
they do not intend to reprocure the airplane from anybody
else. There are both practical and legal arguments why they
can't do it."
   Meanwhile, Lockheed is appealing the Navy's decision, in
an effort to force the government to pay for the termination.
If the appeals process, which can take years to resolve, is
successful, Mr. Tellep said, Lockheed expects to recover
"well over half" of the earlier write-down.
   In accusing Lockheed of defaulting on the P-7 deal, the
Navy said the company "failed to make adequate progress
toward the completion" of two prototypes that fulfill
contract-performance specifications.
   But Mr. Tellep insisted that the plane Lockheed has
designed "meets all requirements and is reasonably priced,"
adding that "we had a great airplane."
   Nonetheless, cancellation of the P-7 program leaves
Lockheed, once one of America's most illustrious plane
makers, with only one active aircraft line -- for the old
C-130 transport. Moreover, it throws into doubt whether the
nation's sixth-largest Pentagon supplier can ever really turn
around its ailing Marietta, Ga., factory, which had been
counting on the P-7 eventually to restore about 2,000 jobs.
Lockheed also leads a team that is bidding to make the Air
Force's next-generation fighter-jet, but this is a highly
uncertain proposition.
   In a larger sense, the default notice also raises serious
questions about other Pentagon contracts that are in dispute.
Under these so-called fixed-price arrangements, a company is
often forced to lock into a pricing schedule before it is
sure about the cost to develop and produce a new technology.
Though the government has vowed not to use such grievous
agreements anymore, billions of dollars have been written off
across the industry because of them.
   And some analysts interpreted the Navy's intransigence on
the P-7 to be a sign that the government was going to play
hardball with those companies that are trying to renegotiate
their fixed-price accords. Just last week, McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. said they would file claims
against the Navy on the A-12 attack plane program.
   But other observers cautioned that each project must be
assessed on an individual basis. In the case of the P-7,
Defense Department officials said that Navy brass -- already
battling to stave off deep cuts in larger, higher-priority
programs -- simply became convinced they couldn't get
lawmakers to support an overall increase in the cost of the
plane.
   Still, the cancellation came as something of a surprise.
In an interview with this newspaper in May, Mr. Tellep
indicated that he was "encouraged" that the P-7 issue would
be resolved favorably.
   But in the end, the chairman said, price became the hurdle
that the two sides just couldn't get over. He explained that
Lockheed and the Navy agreed on pricing for the first three
production lots, covering a total of seven aircraft. Yet they
couldn't make headway on the last five lots.
   Mr. Tellep said he believes that Lockheed, by making the
$300 million adjustment on development, had owned up to its
share of problems on the P-7. But the Navy "also bears
responsibility," he said, for delays on the project. For
example, he said that 18 months into the program, the Navy
still hadn't specified its requirements on "design loads."
   "It was their inability to provide data in a timely way,"
Mr. Tellep said. "We were in conflict on that."
   Navy officials reportedly urged saving the P-7 by agreeing
to buy a maximum of 100 from the planned fleet, thus holding
down the overall program cost. But Mr. Tellep disputed this,
saying that the service never put such a plan on the table.
   The development error essentially was the result of
Lockheed's believing the P-7 would have a lot in common with
its predecessor, the P-3; in fact, to meet the Navy's wishes
for an aircraft that could travel 1,600 miles from home and
linger over waters for as long as four hours, an entirely new
design was called for.
   Mr. Tellep maintained, however, that the Navy was asking
to have it both ways -- a plane that was based on a previous
model, which theoretically would hold down the cost, as well
as difficult-to-meet specifications and design guidelines.
"This was inherently contradictory and not discoverable until
you did a year's worth of design work," Mr. Tellep said.
   "This was not a technical failure or a design failure," he
insisted. "This just underscores the failure of fixed-price
total package procurement. This is one, I'm afraid, where
everybody loses."
