   Nevada Power Co. said it received approval from the state
Public Service Commission for a $110 million power purchase
contract between the utility and SCEcorp's Mission Energy Co.
unit to provide more generating capacity for the fast-growing
Las Vegas area.
   An earlier version of the contract was rejected by the
commission last month as too expensive, so the companies
renegotiated and lowered the price by $50 million. A company
spokesman said the 210-megawatt power plant, consisting of
three combustion turbines to be built, owned and operated by
Mission, would go on line in June 1991, if federal approval
is obtained quickly. It is to be built on the property of an
existing Nevada Power generating station.

   Nevada Power sought to contract out the power plant when
its own construction budget was already at $200 million, the
spokesman said, adding that the utility is adding customers
at a rate of 10% per year. The contract runs for 25 years.
SCEcorp. is a Rosemead, Calif.-based utility holding company.
