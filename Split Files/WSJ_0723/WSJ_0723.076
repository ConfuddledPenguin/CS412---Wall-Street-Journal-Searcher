   PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- BASF Corp. said it has accounted for
all employees at a Cincinnati chemical plant where an
explosion and fire killed one person and injured 73 others,
mostly BASF employees. But it said it hasn't yet been able to
estimate damage to the plant.
   A spokesman said BASF has set up a center to provide
support and counseling for employees and neighbors at a hotel
in Cincinnati. The company, a subsidiary of West Germany's
BASF AG, said it also is opening a claims office at Xavier
University.

   The explosion at the coatings and resins facility killed a
maintenance worker, Lawrence Krechting, a 55-year-old
resident of Norwood, Ohio. Four of the injured were hurt
critically, Cincinnati police said. Initial reports said 63
people were injured and at least one person was missing.
   The facility makes resins, as well as coatings for paper
and for containers such as beverage cans. The company said it
is investigating the incident along with the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration; it suspects
the explosion and fire started in the resin building.
   Air-quality tests show that environmental hazards to
residents are low, BASF said. But "damage to the plant is
serious," and production won't resume for "a considerable
period," BASF said. Customer orders shouldn't be affected
because they will be handled by other BASF plants, BASF said.
