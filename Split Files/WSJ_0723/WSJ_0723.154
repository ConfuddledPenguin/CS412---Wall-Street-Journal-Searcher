   DALLAS -- There hasn't been much excitement in the
bathroom-tissue business since Mr. Whipple first squeezed the
Charmin on Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s television commercials in
1964. That's about to change.
   Kimberly-Clark Corp. hopes to blow some life into the
staid market with its new Kleenex-brand toilet tissue. The
immediate impact of the entry last week, according to
industry analysts, could be a fierce round of couponing and
price-cutting. That could enliven what has been a rather
sleepy quest for market share and at least temporarily end
the regular price increases tissue makers have been able to
push through in the past three years.

   The new tissue -- made with a blow-dry process the company
claims will produce a softer, Kleenex-like tissue -- will
compete head-on with P&amp;G's White Cloud and Charmin, the
market segment leaders with a combined 30% of the $2.9
billion consumer market; Scott Paper Co.'s Cottonelle and
Scott brands; and James River Corp.'s Northern brand.
   But Kimberly-Clark's re-entry into a market it once
abandoned represents a risky thrust into a business without
per-capita consumption growth. "It's not an easy market,"
said George Adler, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co.
   However, he noted, Kimberly-Clark has a weapon: the
well-regarded sales force that helped put the company on the
consumer products map with its Huggies disposable diapers and
Kleenex facial tissues. "They'll get their product on the
shelves," said Mr. Adler.
   Kimberly-Clark all but abandoned the bathroom-tissue
market in 1984, when it quit making Kleenex Boutique bathroom
tissue so that it could devote more of its paper-making
capacity to facial tissues and household paper towels, a
spokeswoman said. The company's Kleenex brand facial tissue,
for example, is the market leader, with 40% of sales.
   Technically, Kimberly-Clark never left the bathroom-tissue
market. For the past six years, the company has continued to
sell its Delsey brand, which holds just 0.1% of the market at
the economy end. That segment, consisting mostly of
private-label, generic and institutional brands, has shrunk
to 16.8% of overall bathroom-tissue sales from 18.7% since
1985, while premium bathroom tissues' share jumped to 62%
from 54.4%.
   Still, knocking heads with P&amp;G at the top end of the
market won't be easy. In a business that is growing only as
much as the population grows, any increase in market share
will have to come either from customers abandoning economy
brands or by chipping away at competitors' shares.
   But few analysts are willing to dismiss Kimberly-Clark's
chances just yet. In recent years, the onetime bulk paper
producer has shown an increasing knack for marketing consumer
products. In the mid-1970s, the company's Kimbies brand
disposable diapers were languishing, and company officials
toyed with dropping the product entirely as P&amp;G's Pampers
pulled ahead. Instead, Kimberly-Clark came back in 1978 with
a new brand that featured the catchy Huggies name, an
improved shape and more absorbent filling. And the company
backed it with heavy marketing support. Today, Huggies holds
31% of the throw-away diaper market, compared with Pampers's
26%.
   Kimberly-Clark is expected to spend $25 million to $50
million to introduce its Kleenex brand, stressing the
product's softness, an image enhanced by the well-known brand
name. The "through-dried" process of blow-drying the tissue
produces a softer finish than the roll driers typically used
to remove the water used in papermaking, the company claims.
   But it's doubtful that P&amp;G will yield any bragging rights
on whose tissue is more squeezably soft. "We are very
committed to this category as an important business for us,
and P&amp;G will continue to lead in the market and grow in the
category," a P&amp;G spokesman said. He declined to indicate what
steps the company would take to defend its market position,
which garners about $750 million in annual sales.
   Analysts expect the battle will initially be confined to
the south and central U.S., where Kimberly-Clark is
introducing its product. But it will be fierce. "When
Kimberly-Clark moves into this market, P&amp;G and James River
and Scott are all going to try to cut them off at the knees,"
said Bruce Kirk at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co.
   More extensive couponing and perhaps even out-and-out
price-cutting are possible tactics in the battle. Mr. Kirk
expects increased price promotions, such as
three-for-the-price-of-two bargain packs. Also, the annual
price increases of recent years may grind to a halt, at least
until the market shakes out, analysts said.
   Initially, Kimberly-Clark's market incursion will be
limited by its production capacity, said Brenda Lee Landry,
analyst for Morgan Stanley Co. The company's new Jenks,
Okla., plant, which has been built to produce the toilet
paper, can satisfy only about 5% of the market. "If they take
market share from P&amp;G, it would only be about 1% or 2%," Ms.
Landry extrapolated, until the company commits more plants to
the effort.
   The introduction of Kleenex bathroom tissue, analysts
said, seems to be part of a more aggressive strategy of
new-product development. The company announced Wednesday, for
instance, that it will begin marketing Huggies brand baby
wipes, an extension of its Huggies disposable-diaper line.
The new baby wipes will compete with top brands made by Scott
and by Sterling Drug Inc., a unit of Eastman Kodak Co., and
Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   In the past, they said, the company has been loath to
venture into smaller markets, such as the $350 million
baby-wipes business. Now, it seems more willing to enter
those markets, using them to extend families of products that
bear the same brand name.
