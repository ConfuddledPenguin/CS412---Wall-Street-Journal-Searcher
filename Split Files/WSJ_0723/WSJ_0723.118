   Media General Inc. said net income more than doubled in
the second quarter but would have declined slightly if not
for a gain on the sale of the company's West Coast weekly
newspapers.
   Including the $6.4 million gain, net was $12.4 million, or
48 cents a share, up from the year-earlier $6.1 million, or
23 cents a share. Revenue climbed 5.4% to $158 million from
$149.9 million.

   Media General of Richmond, Va., said its newspaper
operations remained sluggish. Broadcast division revenue and
earnings rose as the Fairfax, Va., cable operation grew
strongly. Revenue dropped at the company's broadcast
television stations, although profit rose slightly. Newsprint
sales volume increased, and prices continued to rise.
   In the first half, net declined 16% to $15.1 million, or
58 cents a share, from the year-earlier $17.9 million, or 69
cents a share. The drop would have been somewhat worse except
that the latest period included the $6.4 million gain while
the 1989 half included a $5.7 million gain on the sale of a
newsprint mill in California. Sales rose 2.3% to $306.1
million from $299.2 million.
