   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. contributed to the
sell-off of high-technology stocks Friday by reporting
sharply lower second-quarter earnings, largely because of
lower prices for semiconductor memory chips.
   The company also said that it might report a loss for the
third quarter, citing depressed memory-chip prices,
earthquake damage to its Philippines plant and research and
development and start-up costs for its new products,
including its four-megabit memory chip.

   The company reported second-quarter net income of $11
million, or two cents a share, compared with $106 million, or
$1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $1.59 billion
from $1.63 billion. For the six months, net was $24 million,
or seven cents a share, compared with $171 million, or $2.04
a share. Revenue in the six-month period declined to $3.13
billion from $3.23 billion.
   Although analysts called the earnings disappointing, they
said that a drop in second-quarter earnings had been
expected. Estimates had ranged from five cents to 20 cents a
share. Richard Whittington, analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., said he thinks the company's downturn is temporary,
although he now expects it to show a third-quarter loss. "If
they're saying {a loss is} possible, it'll probably happen,"
he said.
   The company blamed its lower earnings on weak prices in
the commodity end of the memory-chip segment of its
semiconductor business. That caused a loss at the company's
components division, which also includes electrical controls,
custom semiconductors and integrated circuits, Texas
Instruments said. Memory-chip orders increased slightly in
the second quarter, though, and the losses in the division
were smaller than in the first quarter, the company said.
   Texas Instruments also said that startup operations and
plant construction depressed earnings. The company is
building a $250 million memory-chip plant in Avezzano, Italy,
which may be operating by early 1991, in time for what the
company expects to be a turnaround in the semiconductor
market. In addition, the company is developing a four-megabit
memory chip that should be marketed late next year and a
16-megabit chip that may be available late in 1992 or in
1993, a spokesman said.
   Other semiconductor manufacturers that are exposed to the
commodity end of the chip market are also suffering.
   National Semiconductor Corp. about a month ago reported
lower net for its fourth quarter, and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. contributed to Friday's high-tech stock sell-off with a
report of its own second-quarter loss. But other
semiconductor makers not so heavily dependent on the
lower-priced chips, including Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp.,
have reported higher quarterly earnings recently.

   TEXAS INSTRUMENTS Inc. says it will introduce its new
four-megabit memory chip late this year. The introductory
date was incorrectly reported in yesterday's edition.
