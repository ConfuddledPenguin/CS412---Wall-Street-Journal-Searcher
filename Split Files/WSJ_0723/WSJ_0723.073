   FLINT, Mich. -- Citizens Banking Corp. said its board has
adopted a shareholder rights plan under which shareholders
will receive rights to purchase shares of preferred stock.
   Under the plan, shareholders may purchase one 1/100 of a
share of preferred stock for each share outstanding of its
common stock.

   According to the terms of the plan, if anyone acquires or
makes a tender offer for 15% or more of Citizens' common
stock, all rights holders except the acquiring person may
purchase Citizens' common stock at 50% of the market price.
If Citizens is acquired, all rights holders may purchase
common stock from the acquiring person at a similar discount.
