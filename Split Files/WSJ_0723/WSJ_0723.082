   The June 22 letter from Prof. John Manley of Stanford
University clarifying his role in Mikhail Gorbachev's
cancellation of his scheduled visit to the Hoover Institution
was most revealing.
   Let me get it straight: On the one side are a bunch of
researchers from the Hoover Institution, all mild-mannered
academics, who, over the years, have done nothing more
sinister or violent than to describe how communism at best
impoverishes people -- and at worst murders them by the
millions -- and to predict communism's eventual demise. On
the other side is Mr. Gorbachev, a man whose whole life was
built on service to the Soviet Communist Party and who,
during that service, most certainly abetted, if not actively
engaged in, countless human-rights violations including the
imprisonment of peace-loving people such as Andrei Sakharov
and the massacre of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan.
And here comes Prof. Manley, who would rather deny the poor
fellows from Hoover the chance to "gloat" over how right they
were all along than see the "proud and self-respecting"
Soviet dictator suffer the ignominy of seeming to come "hat
in hand to the tower of anti-communism for advice on how to
save his failed country."

   It's nice to know where the sympathies of some Stanford
professors lie.
