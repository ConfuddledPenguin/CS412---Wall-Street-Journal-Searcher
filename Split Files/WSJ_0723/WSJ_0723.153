   NEWTON, Mass. -- Stardent Computer Inc. said its board of
directors voted to fire Allen H. Michels and Matthew Sanders
as the company's co-chairmen in the wake of their lawsuit
against Kubota Corp., Stardent's largest investor.
   Messrs. Michels and Sanders remain directors of Stardent
under the company's by-laws, although they lose the
co-chairman title. The two men, who co-founded Ardent
Computer Corp., one of the two firms that were merged to form
Stardent, hadn't been active in operations.

   "Our terminations are unlawful and retaliatory," Mr.
Michels and Mr. Sanders said in a written statement. "This
compounds the illegal acts alleged in our complaint and we
plan to seek immediate redress in the courts."
   Messrs. Michels and Sanders have sued Kubota for $25
million in damages, charging that the Japanese tractor maker
had conspired to fraudulently obtain Stardent's technology.
   Stardent said that a special board committee formed to
investigate the lawsuit "found the claims to be without
merit."
   Stardent also said that Kubota agreed to invest up to $50
million more in Stardent over the next two years in a series
of transactions that could boost its stake to as much as 30%
from the 22% it holds currently. Kubota has already invested
about $100 million in the company, a maker of graphics
supercomputers.
   In addition, Stardent said, Kubota will take over
continuing development of Stardent's current computer line as
well as final assembly and testing. Those functions had been
done at Stardent's Sunnyvale, Calif. facilities. Kubota
already makes the computers in Japan. Stardent will remain
responsible for marketing the products and will develop a new
product line.
   A spokeswoman said that of roughly 100 Stardent workers in
Sunnyvale, about 75 will be offered jobs by Kubota and most
of the rest will be offered jobs at other Stardent
facilities.
