   Some parents wonder at what age their children should get
involved in business. To Valerie Groglio, age two seems about
right.
   The part-time independent accountant has established a
company in Rye, N.Y., in her baby daughter's name. Mrs.
Groglio will manage the company, Chelle Bows Inc., until her
daughter, Michelle, reaches the age of 21.

   But Michelle will become increasingly involved. When she's
six, she'll accompany her mother on buying trips to New York
City and try her hand at making the handsewn fancy hair bows
the company produces. Income from the business will help
finance Michelle's education. And, if all goes well, the
experience will show Michelle that active involvement in
business can be fun, Mrs. Groglio says.
   Many parents are eager to involve their children in
business in some way, especially if the family owns a
business. About 90% of U.S. businesses are family-owned, but,
according to a study in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan Management Review, only 30% of them are
passed on to the second generation. Even parents who don't
have businesses to pass on often want to teach their
youngsters about entrepreneurship and the value of money.
   Robert and Rita Tucker of Rochester, N.Y., helped their
sons start a neighborhood doughnut delivery service nine
years ago, when the boys were five and seven years old, to
help make the boys more conscious of how much things cost.
   The parents taught the children such skills as taking
orders on the telephone, and they helped out by checking the
arithmetic on bills. The sons, Robert Jr. and Brian, started
out delivering doughnuts to neighbors on Sundays. Later they
diversified into delivering newspapers. The business, which
came to be known as Tucker Brother Doughnuts, lasted five
years and brought Robert and Brian $10 to $15 each a week.
   Mrs. Groglio's plan is more ambitious, though she says her
goal is for her daughter to learn about business "without it
taking over her whole life." The bow-making venture got
started after Mrs. Groglio left Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the large
accounting firm, to raise a family. Friends noticed some
fancy bows she had made for her hair and asked her to make
more. Now she supplies bows to specialty stores in and around
Rye, and to distributors in Florida, Connecticut and upstate
New York.
   Chelle Bows makes less money than an accounting practice
Mrs. Groglio established after Michelle's birth. But she says
the business is an attempt to "get back into the old days
where you put your children first."
   At first, she figures, Michelle can help choose materials,
research new fashions in Women's Wear Daily and experiment
with making bows to learn some of the more tangible parts of
the business. Later, Michelle will learn about accounting and
advertising -- she already shows off a Chelle Bows T-shirt.
   When she gets to high school, Michelle will be able to
work for her own company as much or as little as she wants.
But she won't be paid any more than the going rate for a
child of her age. Only when she reaches 21 will she get
control of Chelle Bows. Then she will be free either to
continue the business or dissolve it.
   Mrs. Groglio has high hopes for the company. Making at
least 30 bows per working day, or 7,500 a year, with minimal
overhead -- she handles the accounting herself -- she expects
to have a return on investment of 15% to 20%. The bows retail
for $6 to $16 apiece. By the time Michelle goes to college,
Mrs. Groglio hopes to have saved $300,000.
   Second-generation entrepreneurs say that a parent's
encouragement can be a major factor in a child's attitude
toward business. Stewart Leonard Jr., whose family owns Stew
Leonard's, a large grocery store in Norwalk, Conn., says he
grew up next to his father's dairy plant while the business
was still in its infancy. As the business developed, he says,
he was able to follow its ups and downs, and it became a
great adventure.
   "My father made an effort to make work seem fun," Mr.
Leonard says. "When he came home, he told funny stories, so
the first thing I wanted to do was to go right on over
there." Active involvement also played an important part. Mr.
Leonard still remembers being consulted by his father on the
floor plan for the retail store in 1969.
   Now Mr. Leonard is trying to make the business attractive
to his daughter. "When she comes over to the store, she
learns how to find my office," he says. "No matter what's
going on, I take at least four or five minutes off to spend
with her, giving her an ice-cream cone. So now she doesn't
think I really work."
   But Mr. Leonard says that involving children from an early
age can be risky: "Some of my friends are miserable because
their parents have put too much pressure on them to join the
family business." The most important thing, he contends, is
"to create the right environment for their particular fields
of expertise."
   Don Jonovic, a consultant at Family Business Management
Services in Cleveland, recommends allowing a child to develop
an idea of his own within the family business. He cites the
case of a printer of computer software manuals who gave his
teen-age son free rein to develop an innovative concept --
desktop publishing of business cards. The venture succeeded
and gave the son a chance to develop business interests on
his own.
   Parents interested in encouraging their children in
business can find plenty of help. Junior Achievement, a
national economic education program based in Colorado
Springs, Colo., has encouraged entrepreneurship among
youngsters in junior high school and high school since 1919.
   As an after-school addition to its applied economics
course for 12th-graders, Junior Achievement started a
"company program" nine years ago. Thirty students start a
company, elect officers, sell stock and market a product,
typically candy jars, address books and clocks. After one
semester, the company is liquidated, and the earnings, after
officers' salaries and sales commissions have been paid, are
distributed to the stockholders.
   The success of these ephemeral companies can be
impressive. At Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn,
N.Y., one of the companies set up by students two years ago
was so successful that when the company was liquidated after
18 weeks, shareholders who had paid $2 for a share received
$96, says Mary Honan, manager of development at Junior
Achievement's New York office.
   In New York state alone, participation in the company
program rose to 8,000 last year, more than double the 3,500
five years earlier, Junior Achievement says.
   Other programs start with even younger children. Glenda
Wills, a teacher at Mabry Middle School in Marietta, Ga.,
teaches her sixth-graders a course on business that covers,
among other things, the history of enterprise. For their own
enterprise, children develop and market products at
Christmas.
   David Hill, a consultant with Yarmouth Co., Seattle,
contends that the most important element of business
education is teaching kids that business is more than just
"chasing after big bucks." To develop tomorrow's successful
entrepreneur, he says, treat business as "an adventure and a
game."
