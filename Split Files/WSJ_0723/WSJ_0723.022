   HOUSTON -- Unfazed by slow sales of its Systempro 386
personal computer, Compaq Computer Corp. plans to introduce
three powerful personal computers today that also pose
daunting sales challenges for its dealers.
   The new Compaq Deskpro 486/33L and Deskpro 386/33L models
will vie with workstations for sales in engineering, design
and scientific computing markets. The new Systempro 486/33
aims to replace minicomputers and mainframes at the heart of
office automation networks. Unlike the desktop Deskpro, the
Systempro is a larger, under-the-desk machine designed to
manage the mass-storage systems in networks of personal
computers.

   All three products burnish Compaq's image as a performance
pacesetter, but they also place heavy demands on Compaq's
3,000 dealers, its only distribution channel. Not many
retailers are equipped to sell machines as complicated and
expensive as the $29,999, top-of-the-line Systempro 486.
"Compaq's distribution system just can't handle it yet," said
Egil Juliussen, president of the Computer Industry Almanac.
   Compaq's sales of the Systempro 386 have been slow,
according to surveys by StoreBoard/Computer Intelligence,
which tracks sales at computer retailers. Compaq dealers sold
2,543 of the $15,000 network servers through May, below some
analysts' expectations. Similarly, the Compaq Deskpro 486/25,
first shipped in March, got off to a slow start. "None of the
486s are doing well" with price-conscious buyers, said Joe
Ann Stahel, StoreBoard president.
   "We aren't disappointed," said Michael S. Swavely,
Compaq's president of North American operations. "Our
products will have a major, strategic impact on the computer
industry over the next two to five years. Sales will build as
the market builds."
   Matt Fitzsimmons, a Compaq dealer, shares Mr. Swavely's
confidence. "Our major accounts took one or two of the
Systempro 386s just to see how they fit in," said Mr.
Fitzsimmons, a White Plains, N.Y., Computerland franchisee.
"We have enough large corporations evaluating them that we
think the sales potential is quite good."
   So far, however, corporate buyers aren't equipped to
handle the Systempro 486. Even though the muscular PC,
capable of supporting 200 users, is an inexpensive, flexible
replacement for minis and mainframes, the software and the
design consultants needed to implement the system are still
in short supply. Echlin Inc. had to write its own software to
replace a mainframe with four PC networks, one of which uses
a Systempro 386. "We'll start to see a lot of action in the
next three years," predicted Richard Hock, data processing
director for the Branford, Conn., auto parts manufacturer.
But he also wondered if Compaq dealers could make the sale.
"Some big stores may rise to the challenge," he said, but his
dealer couldn't answer some important questions about the
system's limitations.
   Compaq is beefing up its distribution by opening 15
demonstration centers to help sell network systems. The
company also has sought out network consultants to sign as
dealers and encouraged its chain store dealers to do the
same. "There is a broadbased misconception about what a
Compaq dealer is," Mr. Swavely said.
   So far, Compaq dealers are embracing the company's push to
specialize. MicroAge Inc., based in Tempe, Ariz., has signed
up a dozen network specialists as dealers; about 100 of its
stores have passed Compaq's screening process and qualified
as Systempro sellers. "I think it's going to work," said
president Jeffrey D. McKeever.
   Dealers are tractable because Compaq's high-performance
PCs haven't been as prone to brutal price competition as
low-end PCs are. That comfortable position may change soon,
however. Sun Microsystems Inc. and International Business
Machines Corp., both of whom are signing up dealers for
workstations, will pressure Compaq's Deskpro in the
higher-price end of the PC market. Netframe Systems Inc. and
others are gunning for Systempro in the network market.
   The new Deskpro 486/33L carries suggested retail prices
ranging from $13,999 to $19,499. The Deskpro 386/33L lists
for $9,999 to $15,999. The Systempro 486/33 lists for $20,999
to $29,999. All three computers use Extended Industry
Standard Architecture adopted by Compaq and eight other
companies as an alternative to IBM's Micro Channel
architecture.
