   NORWOOD, Mass. -- Phoenix Technologies Ltd. said its loss
widened in the third quarter ended March 31, partly because
of an increase in its bad-debt provision.
   The maker of computer software's net loss widened to $4.7
million, or 46 cents a share, from $998,000, or 10 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 41% to $9.3 million from
$15.9 million.

   Phoenix president Ronald D. Fisher said that on an
operating basis, excluding the bad debt provisions and other
one-time charges, the company's loss "is generally in line
with our expectations." He added that the operating loss has
decreased in each of the last two quarters.
   Phoenix increased its bad-debt provision for the quarter
to $2.4 million from $1.3 million a year earlier. Rob Langer,
who took over as chief financial officer six weeks ago, said
that he "made the decision to get the bad debt behind us,"
and acknowledge that the company wasn't going to be paid
under some of the software contracts it had previously
booked. "We've gone to more conservative accounting," he
said.
   The accounting changes also helped cause the revenue
decline because Phoenix used to book all the revenue from a
year long contract as soon as the period began, whereas it
now books much of the revenue over the course of the
contract, Mr. Langer said.
   Mr. Fisher said that revenue has risen in each of the last
two quarters and said the backlog is growing.
   For the nine months, Phoenix reported a net loss of $14.2
million, or $1.42 a share, compared with net income of $4.2
million, or 37 cents a share. Revenue fell 46% to $25.8
million from $48.2 million. The bad-debt provision expanded
to $4.4 million from $1.4 million.
   Phoenix said that it remains financially sound without any
bank debt. It has $10.9 million in cash, up slightly from the
previous quarter, but down 31% from $15.9 million a year
earlier.
