   Including Pollution
   In Utilities' Costs

   UTILITY regulators are putting more weight on
environmental factors, giving a boost to alternative energy.
   Nine states now take account of the environment "in one
way or another" when planning to meet power needs, says
Richard Ottinger, a professor at Pace University, White
Plains, N.Y., who led a recent study on the subject. Two of
the states, New York and Wisconsin, now require bids on new
power generators to include projected environmental costs --
a "major breakthrough," says Mr. Ottinger.
   Projected costs of new coal-fired generators in New York
must include about 1.4 cents a kilowatt-hour to account for
air pollution and other environmental impacts. (New York
residents now pay, on average, a total of about seven cents a
kilowatt-hour.) The add-on is lower than recent estimates of
future pollution costs, says Nicholas Lenssen, a researcher
at the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based group that
studies environmental issues. But it helps put solar, wind
and other "renewable energy on a level playing field" with
conventional alternatives, he says.
   The California Energy Commission is considering a similar
rule, but the environmental costs it's considering "wouldn't
be sufficient to make renewable energy {projects by
utilities} cost-effective vs. low-emitting natural gas"
generators, says William Pennington, a research manager at
the commission.
   But to diversify California's energy base, the commission
may require utilities to devote a portion of new-capacity
outlays to renewable energy, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Recycling Drive Faces
   Another Go-Around
                                                                                                       

   AN INITIATIVE on recycling in Massachusetts drew 120,000
petition signers but was derailed for lack of a single
signature.
   The initiative, a potential landmark law watched closely
by environmental and industry groups nationwide, would have
required all packaging sold in the state to be reusable,
recyclable or made partly of recycled material by 1996.
Proponents argued that it would help build markets for
recycled goods and cut wasteful packaging. Industry
opponents, countering that it would be onerous for them and
do little to cut garbage, mounted legal challenges to block
it.
   A drive by the initiative's backers, which included
various state officials, had collected about 120,000
signatures to put the proposed law on the November ballot,
says Amy Perry of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, the initiative's main sponsor. But in a lawsuit
brought by the industry opponents, the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruled this month that the originating petition
for the initiative was invalid.
   State law required it to have 10 valid signatures. The
court ruled that because one of its 10 signers hadn't seen
the final draft of the initiative -- it was described to her
over the phone -- the petition didn't count. Now it's too
late to resubmit for this fall. Environmentalists are trying
to overturn the ruling, but for now the initiative appears to
be quashed.
                                                                                                       

   Trash Crisis Collides
   With Health-Care Crunch
                                                                                                       

   SOARING COSTS for health care may face further upward
pressure from a hospital trash crisis.
   After medical wastes turned up on beaches in recent years,
state and federal laws were enacted requiring hospitals to
track trash more carefully. The laws also classify more
hospital trash as infectious material, which is treated
"almost like nuclear waste," says Jim Karpiak, a
health-policy analyst with the American Hospital Association.
Some hospitals pulverize infectious waste, then soak it in
chlorine before sending it to special incinerators or
landfills.
   Of 6,700 tons of trash produced daily by U.S. hospitals,
about 15% is classified as infectious, says William Rutala, a
University of North Carolina specialist on medical waste. But
hospitals in four Eastern states participating in a pilot
program of new federal medical-waste rules typically classify
30% or more of their trash as infectious, he adds. For
Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Conn., the annual trash
bill has tripled to almost $1 million under the new rules,
says Norman Roth, a hospital official.
   Such bills threaten funding crunches at many hospitals,
which are trying harder to cut trash. Emerson Hospital, in
Concord, Mass., switched this month to cloth from disposable
diapers. The change won't mean much saving on its trash bill,
but it represents the first step in a broad program to "start
decreasing waste, because it won't be affordable if we
don't," says Coco Richmond, Emerson's materials manager.

   Clarifying Impurities
   In Bottled Water
                                                                                                       

   SOME KINDS of bottled water in Vermont may soon dry up
because of a new labeling law there.
   The law, effective this month, requires sellers of bottled
water in the state to disclose on their labels the levels of
four common contaminants: sodium, lead, arsenic and nitrates.
Thought to be the first of its kind, the law was sponsored by
State Rep. Andrew Christiansen of East Montpelier, who says
he grew worried because of high levels of nitrates found in
some awful-tasting bottled water he bought.
   One of the state's largest sellers of bottled water,
Perrier Group of America, which markets Poland Spring bottled
water, says it probably will drop some bottled-water products
in Vermont to avoid the costs of new labels.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Christiansen now gets his water from a
nearby well that tested low in nitrates.
