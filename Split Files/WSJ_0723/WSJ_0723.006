   NEW YORK -- Hachette S.A., the owner of Woman's Day
magazine, rejected as inadequate a number of bids for the
mass-circulation magazine and extended the deadline for
potential suitors.
   Hachette, based in Paris, put the magazine up for sale in
May, saying it must find cash to pay off debt from its
purchase of Diamandis Communications Inc., the U.S. publisher
of Woman's Day. In 1988, Hachette paid $712 million for
Diamandis.

   Peter Diamandis, chairman of DCI, wouldn't comment on the
progress of the sale. Mr. Diamandis and Hachette's top
executives had set a deadline of Friday at midnight for
Woman's Day to be sold or taken off the market.
   A DCI executive said that after a number of bids were
rejected, Hachette was giving some of the suitors time to
prepare new bids. The executive said a new deadline has been
set for midnight Tuesday. Diamandis insiders said the French
have set a floor of about $175 million. "If the French don't
get their price, they will pull it from the market and work
on improving the magazine," the executive said.
   Bidders for the magazine have included British media baron
Robert Maxwell, Macfadden Holdings Inc., Reader's Digest
Association Inc., and Gruner + Jahr USA Publishing, according
to people close to the negotiations. A Reader's Digest
spokesman said the company declined to comment.
Representatives for the other companies couldn't be reached
for comment over the weekend.
   Daniel Filipacchi, chairman of Hachette Publications Inc.,
the U.S. publishing arm of Hachette S.A., is in New York
handling the sale of the magazine. Started in 1937, Woman's
Day is one of the largest selling magazines in the country,
with average newsstand sales of 4.6 million.
   Mr. Diamandis characterized bids for the magazine as
disappointing. There is speculation that should Woman's Day
not be sold, another DCI magazine, possibly the nostalgia
magazine Memories, would be put on the market in place of
Woman's Day. DCI also publishes the U.S. edition of Elle, Car
and Driver, and Popular Photographer.
   Mr. Diamandis has said the self-imposed deadlines were
necessary so the sale wouldn't drag on, hurting staff morale
as well as advertising sales.
