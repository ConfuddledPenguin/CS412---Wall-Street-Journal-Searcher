   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Southern New England Telephone, a unit
of Southern New England Telecommunications Corp., said it
filed for a rate increase of $86.4 million, or 8.7%.
   If the state Department of Public Utility Control approves
the move following hearings this fall, the increase would
take effect in January. The company said it hasn't requested
a rate increase in eight years.
