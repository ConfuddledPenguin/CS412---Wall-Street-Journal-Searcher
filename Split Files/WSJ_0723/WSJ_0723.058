   American Brands Inc. agreed to pay $975 million to acquire
Moen Group Inc., a faucet maker, from Forstmann Little &amp; Co.,
a leveraged buy-out firm.
   For American Brands, the acquisition sharpens the focus of
its hardware and home-improvement business. That business is
one of four areas where the Old Greenwich, Conn., company is
trying to diversify to reduce its dependence on tobacco,
which still generates 59% of its sales and 67% of its
operating profit.

   For Forstmann Little, the sale price represents a fat
sixfold profit for its equity investors since the New York
concern paid $840 million to acquire Stanadyne Inc., Moen's
predecessor, in March 1988.
   American Brands stock price rose $1 a share to $70.50 in
composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
despite a broad market decline, mainly because of
higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
   For the quarter, American Brands said profit rose 32% to
$158.4 million, or $1.51 a share fully diluted, from $120.2
million, or $1.18 a share; revenue rose 8.4% to $2.95 billion
from $2.72 billion. The results were helped by strong sales
of cigarettes, including Benson &amp; Hedges, in Britain.
   Allan Kaplan, a beverage and tobacco analyst at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., said American Brands paid "a rich price" of 10
times operating cash flow for Moen that he estimated will
dilute earnings 20 cents to 30 cents a share in 1991.
American Brands also sells life insurance, liquor and office
products.
   Emmanuel Goldman, beverage and tobacco analyst at
PaineWebber Inc., said American Brands is targeting the
market for kitchen and bathroom repairs because homeowners
believe that in a flat real estate market, such repairs can
boost their resale price. Even so, American Brands said it
plans to sell its Waterloo tool-box business.
   Brian Little, a founding partner of Forstmann Little, said
the sale is "a classic example of how a deal can go right,
even as the critics look back on leveraged buy-outs of the
1980s that reached a point of excess."
   Forstmann financed the Stanadyne purchase with $75 million
in equity, $530 million in bank debt and $235 million in
subordinated debt from Forstmann's own investors. The firm
then sold five businesses in metals and auto parts for $240
million.
   At the same time, it renamed the company Moen and boosted
its sales to $380 million from $300 million, Mr. Little said,
"by pushing distribution toward the replacement market" via
such sales outlets as Channel home centers and away from the
weaker new-housing market. Moen, which pioneered
single-handle kitchen and bathroom faucets, has about 25% of
the U.S. faucet market.
   After debt repayment, the sale will yield Forstmann about
$500 million, giving its equity investors a gross annual
profit, before fees, of 112% and the firm's debt investors a
29% annual return. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. advised Forstmann,
Little &amp; Co. on the transaction and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
advised American Brands.
   The sale is Forstmann's third big deal this year. The
buy-out firm acquired Gulfstream Aerospace from Chrysler
Corp. for $825 million and has agreed to acquire General
Instrument Corp. for $1.47 billion, or $44.50 a share.
   General Instrument shares have been trading above the
Forstmann bid because two other concerns, Kelso &amp; Co., a
leveraged buy-out company, and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Inc., have asked for information about General
Instrument, saying they might want to make a bid before a
mid-August deadline.
