   The chemical units of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Eastman Kodak
Co. plan to study the feasibility of jointly producing
cellulose acetate, the French company said.
   If the project receives a green light, Rhone-Poulenc
Chimie and Eastman Chemical Co. will form a joint venture
requiring a total investment of about $200 million to $300
million, a Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said. The partners would
divide the costs equally.

   The site of the venture will be determined in the course
of the feasibility study, he said.
   Cellulose acetate is used in the production of cigarette
filters, textiles and plastics. The companies are targeting a
completion date around the end of 1993 for a factory that
would produce 60,000 tons of the chemical annually.
   The spokesman said this would represent the first
cooperative effort between Paris-based Rhone-Poulenc and
Kodak of Rochester, N.Y.
   A U.S. subsidiary of the French concern bought Kodak's
Beta Physics polyester film operation in January 1988.
