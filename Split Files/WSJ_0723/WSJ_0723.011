   NEW YORK -- It wasn't a very good week at United
Telecommunications Inc.
   The Westwood, Kan.-based firm and its chairman William T.
Esrey were hit with six class-action lawsuits resulting from
its poor second-quarter showing. And US Sprint Communications
Co., United Telecom's long-distance telephone subsidiary and
the source of many of its problems, said that three top
executives have left the company.

   The lawsuits, filed separately last week in the U.S.
District Courts in Kansas City, Kan., and Kansas City, Mo.,
allege that Mr. Esrey and United Telecom misled investors
about the company's earnings prospects.
   A $42 million operating loss at US Sprint caused United
Telecom's net income to fall 55% in the quarter to $40.6
million, or 18 cents a share, on a 12% rise in revenue to
$2.07 billion. Included were non-recurring charges totaling
$72 million, to cover a 5% reduction in US Sprint's work
force and other expenses.
   The results stunned Wall Street analysts -- who had
already cut their second-quarter estimates for United Telecom
to around 50 cents -- and shareholders. In his complaint,
Raymond Campbell, a private investor, who owns 100 shares of
the company's stock, accused Mr. Esrey of making optimistic
statements about United Telecom's future profitability while
at the same time planning to take charges against the
company's second-quarter earnings because of problems at US
Sprint.
   Mr. Campbell's complaint noted that when United Telecom
posted a 42% rise in its first-quarter net income in April,
Mr. Esrey at that time said in a press release that "We
expect . . . revenue growth and cost control to generate
further improvements in operating margin." When the
second-quarter results were posted, the complaint said Mr.
Esrey told Dow Jones News Service that the charges had been
planned for some time. The other five lawsuits made similar
claims, according to a United Telecom spokesman.
   Mr. Esrey was unavailable to comment on the suits. The
spokesman said the company is "not in the habit of commenting
on matters that are in litigation."
   Meanwhile, David Gergacz, who led US Sprint's successful
effort to win 40% of the multibillion dollar FTS-2000 federal
telephone project, has left the company and been replaced by
Gary Forsee, who used to head American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s 60% share of the project. Also gone are Clifford Hall,
who had been hired to fix US Sprint's problem-plagued billing
system, and Jerry W. Cosley, vice president of communications
for United Telecom and US Sprint. None of the three
executives was available for comment. United Telecom's
spokesman said their exits were unrelated to the
second-quarter problems and that they left to "pursue other
opportunities."
   Last week, Mr. Esrey told this newspaper that he regarded
United Telecom's second-quarter showing, which came after
several profitable quarters at US Sprint, as "a serious
setback." He pegged the decline to severe competition in the
consumer and small-business sector of the long-distance
market. He also said that more than 1,000 workers would be
cut from US Sprint's 20,000 member work force to deflate
ballooning costs.
