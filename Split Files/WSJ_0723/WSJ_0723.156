   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- First Fidelity Bancorp., parent of
New Jersey's largest bank, said it had a loss of $150.4
million in the second quarter, the result of a sweeping
review of the bank's loan portfolio.
   The loss, which contrasted with net income of $21.1
million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier, reflects a
previously announced $300 million provision for loan losses
and a provision of $13.9 million for possible losses on
foreclosed property.

   Tony Terraciano, chairman and chief executive officer,
said First Fidelity "should begin to return to a more normal
level of profitability in the second half of the year as
credit loss provisions decline."
   The sharp increase in second-quarter loan-loss provisions
is part of an ambitious effort by Mr. Terraciano, who took
over First Fidelity in January, to resurrect the bank's
profit, which has languished for the past few years. Since he
became chairman, he has fired 1,400 of the bank's
approximately 14,000 employees, taken a $23 million charge
and slashed the dividend 40%.
   First Fidelity said total nonperforming assets at June 30
were $839.9 million, up 39% from the previous quarter, and
reserves for loan losses totaled $534.8 million, up 29% from
$413 million. Net charge-offs for the second quarter totaled
$178.2 million.
   Net interest income for the second quarter was $260
million, down $4 million from a year earlier, and the
company's net interest margin -- the difference between what
it pays for funds and what it earns -- shrank to 3.8% from
4.1%. Non-interest income for the second quarter totaled $73
million, down from $79.9 million a year earlier. Overhead
expenses for the quarter were $220.9 million, compared with
$228.1 million.
