   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Syntex Corp. said it reached a
settlement with Missouri and the Environmental Protection
Agency over a dispute involving one of the company's
subsidiaries and dioxin contamination in the state.
   The dispute stems from the contamination of a number of
Missouri sites in the 1970s by wastes allegedly transported
from a Verona, Mo., plant operated by a tenant of Syntex
Agribusiness, the subsidiary. The worst hit of the sites is
Times Beach, a town about 20 miles southwest of St. Louis
that was rocked seven years ago when it was discovered that
dioxin in waste oil had been sprayed on the town's streets.

   As part of the settlement, Syntex will clean up the
biggest site and pay the EPA $2 million a year for five
years. The company says it expects reserves and possible
reimbursements from insurers to cover the cost of the
cleanup, which the company says could take as long as 10
years to complete.
   The EPA estimates that cleanup of the sites will cost $118
million. Syntex, which didn't produce the dioxin, is
considered a responsible party under federal law.
