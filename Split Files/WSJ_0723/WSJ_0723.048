   NEW YORK -- The yen has been behaving like a soggy
firecracker: Any buying interest that has flared up has
fizzled quickly.
   That's because the yen is still hindered by capital
outflows from Japan and concerns about Japanese inflationary
pressures -- even though investors are warming up to the
currency, some economists say.

   "The yen has come a long way from its trough, {but} it
hasn't been a sensational rally," says Lawrence Krohn, a
senior economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He believes
it will take a while for the yen to get up a "good head of
steam."
   When dealings finished here Friday, the dollar was quoted
at 148.60 yen, moderately higher than 148.10 at Thursday's
close.
   In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 148.20 yen soon
after the opening; it closed at 148.30 yen in Tokyo Friday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6330
marks, down from Tokyo's Friday's close of 1.6378 marks.
   In non-dollar trading, the mark and Swiss franc finished
the week at 90.80 and 106.07 yen, respectively, up from 90.25
and 105.38 yen late Thursday.
   While the yen's performance wasn't impressive Friday, the
longer-term picture is brighter. The dollar is down about
7.3% from the 39-month high of 160.30 yen hit April 2; since
early May, the yen has risen approximately 5.5% against the
mark and the Swiss franc.
   Between February and April, the yen was caught in a
downward spiral because of the dive in the Japanese stock and
bond markets and the foreign exchange market's disappointment
with Japan's relatively low interest rates.
   The drop came to a halt after the Japanese financial
markets stabilized and higher Japanese rates lured investors.
   But capital outflows from Japan are offsetting those
bullish influences, economists say. In May, net long-term
capital outflows from Japan totaled $5.6 billion, slightly
more than $5.3 billion in April but less than this year's
high of $7.9 billion in February.
   "The capital flows haven't dropped off that much. They
{the Japanese} have a sustained desire to diversify" their
portfolios, says David Hale, chief economist at Kemper
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
   Because yen-denominated investments remain pricey despite
the selling binge earlier this year, Japanese investors favor
less expensive West German, Canadian and Australian assets,
he says.
   With growing interest in the financial markets of West
Germany and other Western European nations, the U.S. markets
are no longer the clear favorite of the Japanese, economists
say.
   Although Japan's inflation rate is relatively low compared
with the rates in other major industrial nations, worries
about building price pressures are still making investors "a
little bit leery" about putting capital in Japan, says
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America
Inc.
   Japan's broadly defined money supply grew at an average
rate of 12.6% in June from the year-earlier level,
accelerating at a double-digit rate for the seventh month in
a row. The June rate was, however, off substantially from the
13.2% rate in April and May.
   The Bank of Japan predicts the money supply will expand at
rates around 12% in the third quarter, slower than the 13%
average in the second quarter. The central bank's governor,
Yasushi Mieno, said recently that the rapid money supply
growth is due to temporary and special factors, such as the
liberalization of Japanese interest rates.
   Inflation worries have weighed on the yen for some time
even though the Bank of Japan has maintained a tight monetary
policy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecasts that Japan's inflation rate will run
about 2.7% this year, much higher than 1.5% in 1989.
   Although the yen has drawbacks, it is expected to keep
working its way up in coming months with help from the higher
Japanese interest rates.
   Yen money market rates have been on the rise recently, and
there is widespread speculation that the Bank of Japan will
soon raise its 5.25% discount rate, possibly in September.
   The yen aside, traders say the dollar will probably
continue to trade within a range for the time being as market
participants wait for fresh news about the U.S. economy and
the budget negotiations in Washington.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $361.30 an ounce, down 10 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$361.45 an ounce.
