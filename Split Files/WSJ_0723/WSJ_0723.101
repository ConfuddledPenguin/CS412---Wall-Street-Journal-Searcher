   OTTAWA -- Canada's consumer price index rose in June at
its slowest pace in 18 months, but the Bank of Canada showed
no signs of relaxing its tough anti-inflation policy.
   The index in June was up 4.3% from a year earlier,
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said Friday. June was
the first month in a year that Canada's consumer price index
has shown a smaller annual increase than the U.S. index. The
U.S. consumer price index increased 4.7% in June from a year
earlier.

   Economic analysts welcomed the price report, saying it
gave the Bank of Canada additional scope to ease Canada's
high interest rates. But federal government officials warned
that Canadian wage pressures remained strong and high wage
settlements were cutting into corporate profits rather than
being offset by higher prices. Corporations can't swallow
such cost increases indefinitely, an official said. Corporate
profits in January-March fell to their lowest quarterly level
since the July-September period of 1986.
   John Lipsky, London-based economic analyst at the
investment bank of Salomon Brothers, said Canadian monetary
authorities appear to be pursuing "more aggressive monetary
goals than in the U.S." Canadian monetary restraints have
kept short-term Canadian interest rates more than five
percentage points above comparable U.S. rates for four
months.
   Mr. Lipsky said Canada's domestic demand growth appears to
have slowed sufficiently to permit monetary policy to be
eased without a resurgence of inflation. But he said Canadian
authorities remain concerned about wage pressures and
inflationary expectations in advance of the planned Jan. 1
implementation of a 7% goods and services tax.
   A major round of wage bargaining is due to start later
this week when Canada's auto makers are to open contract
negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union.
   Major Canadian collective agreements in the three months
ended in April provided for a 6.2% average annual wage
increase, compared with 5.5% in the three months ended in
January.
   Michael Gregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist, said some
recent wage contracts have involved smaller settlements. If
this trend continues, he predicted the Bank of Canada will
allow interest rates to edge lower, starting in September.
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the Toronto-based
securities company of Burns Fry Ltd., said the case for lower
interest rates was strengthened by Canada's May retail sales
data, also reported Friday by Statistics Canada. Retail sales
in May declined 1% following a 1.4% drop in April.
   "Despite concerns over rising wages, the current
environment provides the central bank with leeway to ease
policy," said Bank of Nova Scotia economist Aron Gampel. As
well as lower consumer inflation, he noted a significant
reduction in the pace of economic activity, credit demands
and money supply growth.
