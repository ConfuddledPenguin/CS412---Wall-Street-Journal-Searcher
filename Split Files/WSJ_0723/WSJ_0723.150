   TOKYO -- A team of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co.
scientists investigating "cold fusion" say they have produced
significant test results that have proven elusive to U.S.
researchers.
   The group reported a burst of neutrons up to 50 times as
large as those claimed by University of Utah chemists in
March 1989. Those results sparked a "cold fusion" craze, but
skepticism has mounted since then, largely because of the
failure of other U.S. scientists to detect large numbers of
neutrons and other indications of fusion. The fusion of
hydrogen atoms at room temperatures would be expected to
produce such a result.

   An NTT Basic Research Laboratories team led by Eiichi
Yamaguchi published a report in April's Japanese Journal of
Applied Physics saying they triggered a "gigantic" blast of
one million to two million neutrons a second for two to three
seconds. Two follow-up tests produced blasts of 600,000 to
900,000 neutrons a second for one to two seconds.
   The scientists said the results seem to prove the
existence of cold fusion.
   The paper reports that about 20 additional tests were
conducted without showing such results. Mr. Yamaguchi's group
has conducted several experiments in recent weeks and
produced excess heat three or four times -- another possible
sign of fusion -- but failed to detect neutrons again.
   Fusion scientists familiar with the work say it is
interesting, as much for the unique technique as for the
results. Most fusion research involves a basic electrolysis
experiment of soaking a palladium rod in "heavy" water. But
the NTT reseachers soaked the palladium rods in deuterium gas
for a day, then put them in a vacuum chamber. As they
evacuated the chamber, the neutron blast occurred.
   One side of the palladium rods was coated with gold to
prevent the escape of deuterium atoms from that side, while
the other side was coated with magnesium oxide, which would
permit the atoms to escape.
   The approach is similar to techniques sometimes used in
semiconductor research, a field Mr. Yamaguchi has worked in.
   Last November, separate research teams at Nagoya
University and Osaka University each claimed to have detected
unusually large bursts of neutrons coming from cold fusion
experiments. Both groups are still working to duplicate those
results.
   Japanese university scientists have created a fairly
organized structure for pursuing cold fusion. In February,
Hideo Ikegami, a professor at Nagoya University, selected a
group of 20 academic research teams from around the country
to work loosely together, dividing up research methods and
sharing results. The Ministry of Education is supporting
their work for two years, although Mr. Ikegami refuses to
disclose the amount of support.
   Mr. Ikegami said the most significant result to come out
of the university effort will be published this month in the
Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology. In the experiment,
Osaka researchers, using conventional approaches, say they
detected neutrons with the energies that would be produced by
the fusion reaction. But the neutron emission occurred so
infrequently that the results aren't as noteworthy as the NTT
tests. Their work is similar to that done at Brigham Young
University, which was released around the same time as the
University of Utah tests. Scientists at Hitachi Ltd. in April
also produced similar results.
   With skepticism high and funding in question for U.S.
fusion research, supporters are quick to highlight any claims
of success. Singling out Japanese progress could become
another tool for trying to draw more backing.
   Fritz G. Will, director of the U.S. National Cold Fusion
Institute in Utah, spent four days this month visiting five
labs in Japan, including those in NTT and Osaka.
   Mr. Will said in an interview last week that he concluded
"the rate of progress in Japan at the present time is
considerably larger than in the U.S., " because "there is a
considerably larger number of groups in Japan . . . and there
is quite a good level of coordination or cooperation."
   Mr. Will also praised the relatively low level of
controversy over the efforts in Japan. The Japanese, he said,
"can devote their time to cold fusion work -- they are not
exposed to this barrage of unfair criticism that the
researchers {in the U.S.} are constantly exposed to."
