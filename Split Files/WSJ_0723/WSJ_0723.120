   NEW YORK -- Charles Kaiser Jr. abruptly resigned as
chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the major professional body for U.S.
accountants.
   Thomas W. Rimerman, managing partner of Frank, Rimerman &amp;
Co., Menlo Park, Calif., was designated acting chairman by
the AICPA board. Mr. Rimerman, who was vice chairman, will
formally assume the chairmanship for a one-year term when the
institute holds its annual meeting in October.

   The AICPA is the primary professional group of
accountants; it has more than 296,000 members, and sets
auditing standards for public accountants.
   In submitting his resignation as chairman, Mr. Kaiser, a
partner in the Los Angeles office of Pannell Kerr Forster,
told the AICPA that "other commitments have become so
compelling" that he didn't believe he could "continue to do
justice" to the position.
   The institute wouldn't comment beyond the statement, and
Mr. Kaiser was said to be traveling and couldn't be reached
for comment.
   However, in a statement, Mr. Kaiser indicated the other
commitments related to a dispute with Pannell Kerr over his
partnership agreement. James Tinney, partner in charge of
Pannell Kerr's New York office, said that the dispute was
settled after arbitration and that Mr. Kaiser was
"absolutely" still a partner.
