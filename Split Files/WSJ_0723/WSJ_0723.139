   Two shareholder lawsuits seeking class action status have
been filed against Caesars World Inc. in the wake of its
announced intention to make a tender offer for the 13.4%
stake it doesn't already hold in Caesars New Jersey Inc.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, an
investor alleges that the company's $22-a-share, or $48
million, offer is inadequate and that it didn't seek
competing acquisition proposals. Another suit filed in state
court by four investors names 10 officers and directors of
the company as defendants and seeks an injunction blocking
the offer. Caesars World, based in Los Angeles, owns and
operates hotels and casinos.
