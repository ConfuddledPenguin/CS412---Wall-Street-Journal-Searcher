   Dynatech Corp. expects to report renewed sales and
earnings growth for the fiscal first quarter, John F. Reno,
executive vice president and chief operating officer, said.
   The Burlington, Mass.-based technology company will report
per-share earnings for the June quarter roughly midway in the
range of analysts' estimates of 37 cents to 50 cents, on
sales of $115 million to $120 million, Mr. Reno said.

   A year earlier, net income was $3.9 million, or 37 cents a
share on a larger base of shares, on sales of $102.8 million.
"The first quarter will show a nice increase over last year,
and that we've regained momentum," Mr. Reno said. He sees
steady growth in sales and income for the year.
   Dynatech, which is scheduled to report first-quarter
results at its annual meeting today, owns dozens of
businesses in communications, medical diagnostics, scientific
and consumer markets. The company extends broad autonomy to
its operating units, employing just 35 people in its
corporate offices.
   Mr. Reno said in an interview that the company has
acquired two new businesses, increasing its portfolio of
operating units to 42.
   Dynatech began diversifying from its base in medical
diagnostics and data communications in the early 1980s, with
acquisitions in electronic parts manufacturing,
auto-emissions test equipment, communications test gear, and
weather sensors, including lightning detectors. Its
best-known business is the consumer products unit, Whistler,
which sells auto radar detectors and marine electronics.
   More recently, Dynatech has moved into software and
geophysical and environmental test systems. Also recently,
Whistler unveiled new consumer products, including a
collision avoidance device for trucks that warns when
obstacles or cars approach the driver's blind side.
   Communications is Dynatech's largest business, says
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Danielle Danese. She estimates
communications accounted for about $75 million in sales in
the fourth quarter, growing at a 20% clip year-over-year.
Medical and diagnostic product lines were a $15 million
business growing at just 6%, while scientific instruments
grew 25%, to about $27 million. She was cautious on the
stock's prospects in a recent report, issuing a "neutral"
rating pending a pickup in earnings momentum.
   Mr. Reno said that military product lines such as
electronic parts were growing slowly and that Dynatech was
trying to shift some of that technology to commercial
markets. But he said overall profit margins improved during
the first quarter, and cash flow per share increased. Cash
flow from operations rose 12% in the last fiscal year, and
Dynatech stock is currently trading at less than five times
operating cash flow per share, Mr. Reno said.
   Since December 1988, the company has spent about $50
million buying its own stock, narrowing the number of shares
outstanding by nearly three million, or about 25%, leaving
about 9.7 million shares outstanding.
