   A decision has apparently been made to raise revenues
through new taxes. The question facing Congress and the
administration now is whose ox to gore and where to gore it.
Needless to say, ox-goring is never pleasant or riskless.
But, if you're going to gore, you should at least do it
intelligently. And therein lies the rub.
   Budget negotiators are reportedly toying with the idea of
a securities transfer tax that would levy a fee of up to 0.5%
on sales of stocks, bonds, futures and other instruments,
with the exception of Treasury securities. The hope is that
this tax will raise billions, while reducing volatility in
financial markets. There is only one problem with this plan.
It won't work.

   In the course of its failure, this tax is likely to
destroy part of the U.S. financial market, enrich foreign
competitors, increase the cost of capital for U.S. firms,
drive down U.S. stock and bond prices, hurt small investors
and increase volatility in capital markets.
   Let's march through the logic. The transaction tax has
strong support from the British financial services sector.
London's Financial Times led its coverage of the proposal
with the headline "City Sees Advantages in U.S. Levy on
Volume," and explained that "if the U.S. Administration
decides to go ahead with a securities turnover tax, it will
have strong support in the City of London."
   The British are excited about the tax because, if it is
set at a high enough level, it is certain to drive billions
of dollars to London. It is easy for traders to shift their
activities to any market via a phone line and a fax machine.
A meaningful financial transaction tax in one jurisdiction
can drive business to other, lower-tax jurisdictions in the
shake of an electron's tail.
   The natural bureaucratic response is to write rules that
would gather the tax regardless of where the relevant
transaction takes place. But even bureaucrats who might be
charged with this Herculean task know they would fail.
   The Congressional Budget Office recognizes, for example,
that the tax "would be difficult to administer." The CBO
allows that "it would be difficult for the IRS to audit these
transactions, so compliance would be low." The staff of the
Joint Committee on Taxation joins in the chorus, explaining
cautiously that it "may prove difficult to exert jurisdiction
over foreign situs transfers," and that "transactions by
U.S.-owned foreign intermediaries could present significant
avoidance possibilities. Broadening the base of the tax to
include such intermediaries may entail modifying tax
treaties."
   English translation: If the government adopts this tax it
won't be able to collect a big piece of it. Even an army of
bureaucrats producing a mind-numbing blizzard of regulations
would fail. An informal survey shows that tax lawyers have
already come up with several ideas for legally avoiding the
tax. One example involves setting up investment vehicles
offshore. U.S. taxpayers would hold interests in these
vehicles for relatively long periods of time, but the
vehicles' portfolios would trade rapidly in newly designed
foreign securities that would be carefully structured to
mimic highly taxed U.S. stocks and bonds. To reach these
transactions, American authorities would have to tax foreign
entities trading foreign securities in foreign markets. Good
luck.
   History unfortunately demonstrates that the government has
the gumption to embark on such pointless ventures. Recall the
Interest Equalization Tax adopted during the Kennedy
administration and the baroque set of regulations designed to
prevent capital flight in connection with that tax. That
ill-fated experiment created the Eurodollar market -- a
market that is today the backbone of Europe's financial
services industry.
   Better yet, compare the American plan to what's going on
overseas. Britain is now eliminating its transaction tax, as
are West Germany and the Netherlands. Pressure is building on
French and Swiss authorities to abolish their transfer taxes.
The Swedish transfer tax was recently abolished after
resourceful Swedes successfully transferred much trading to
London from Stockholm. The U.S. is, at the moment, the only
nation in the world thinking of bucking the trend by raising
transaction taxes.
   But suppose the inevitable doesn't happen, and the U.S.
adopts a transaction tax that raises billions of dollars and
doesn't drive business offshore. Is that the end of the
matter? Hardly.
   To start with, it is important to understand that a 0.5%
transaction tax looks "bigger" to the world's capital markets
than a 0.5% sales tax looks to consumers. On a $40 share of
stock, a 0.5% sales tax amounts to 20 cents per transaction.
Institutions, however, pay as little as 5.3 cents per share
in brokerage fees. For these investors, a 0.5% tax on a $40
transaction would almost quadruple brokerage costs. The tax
is even costlier for those in foreign-exchange and other
markets that are more liquid than the U.S. stock exchanges.
Consider transaction costs in the government securities
industry, where primary dealers can earn as little as $312 on
a $1 million bond transaction. A tax of 0.5% on $1 million
amounts to $5,000 -- 16 times the primary dealers' income on
the trade.
   There's another way a tax on financial transactions
differs from a consumer sales tax. A sales tax is paid once,
at the point of consumption. In contrast, a transaction tax
is like a diamond -- it is forever. It is paid again and
again, everytime a security is traded. To adjust for this
compounded transactions cost, markets are likely to reduce
the current price of all financial instruments subject to the
tax. The Congressional Research Service estimates that such a
tax would cause at least a 9.3% drop in the value of the
stock market.
   It seems clear that the administration also understands
the harm its proposals can do. Notice that the proposals
floating around Washington all exempt federal debt securities
from the tax -- so that the price of Treasury securities
won't fall while other prices decline. But why would we want
to raise capital costs for the private sector while
effectively subsidizing federal debt creation. Sauce for the
goose seems not to be sauce for the gander.
   As for those who believe the tax will raise substantial
revenue, they are likely to be disappointed. One of the
axioms of tax economics is that you should try to tax
behavior that won't change much in response to the imposition
of the tax. Here, the government is considering a tax on one
of the world's most quickly moving targets. Even absent
forcing migration, the imposition of the tax will reduce the
volume of trading and lower value of the instruments traded,
thereby reducing the Treasury's take.
   The bulk of the tax burden is likely to fall on a silent
but solidly middle class group of investors whose wealth is
invested in pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies
and other collective investment vehicles. It will also weigh
on charitable foundations and educational institutions, which
will see the value of their endowments decline and the rate
of return on their assets decrease. Hard hit too will be
small investors who want to buy and sell but don't have the
means to make sophisticated trades offshore. This is a
middle-class tax that will be paid out of middle America's
pockets. The burden won't fall on Wall Street fat cats.
   To be fair, I must mention that there is a theory popular
among some economists that low transaction costs lead to
"trend-following" trading rules that exacerbate market
volatility and promote excessive speculation. In theory the
transactions tax will slow this type of trading, diminish
speculation and reduce volatility.
   The trouble with this theory is that it is at least as
speculative as the speculation it hopes to drive from the
market. As the CBO has noted, "The October 1987 crash seemed
to be no less severe in Japan and the United Kingdom despite
the existence of {transaction taxes} in both."
   The anti-volatility argument also seems to fall apart once
it is cast in the real world. If traders are able to engage
in portfolio insurance in foreign markets, and if
international pricing mechanisms transmit that selling
pressure back to the U.S. (in larger, more discrete "chunks"
designed to avoid the cumulation of transaction tax
payments), then the U.S. will still experience the price
effects of portfolio insurance emanating from abroad.
   Indeed, because the transaction tax will have to be paid
by all investors -- not just trend-followers, speculators and
other vermin -- it could well make the markets "choppier."
Investors would be loathe to trade until markets have moved
far enough for or against their positions to make it
worthwhile for them to bear transaction tax costs.
   Perhaps the best short criticism of a transaction tax was
presented to the Senate Government Affairs Committee in
January 1989: "A stock transfer tax has no evident
justification. It could cause distortions in the financial
markets, and could cause many investors, particularly
institutions, to shift their equity trading away from
organized exchanges and to foreign countries." Who could have
analyzed the issue so succinctly and so well? Only the head
of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard Darman. Need
we say more?
