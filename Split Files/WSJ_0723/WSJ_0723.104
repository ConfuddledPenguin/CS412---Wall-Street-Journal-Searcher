   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is inviting congressional
leaders to meet with him daily to speed progress toward a
deficit-reduction compromise.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said yesterday on
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that Mr. Bush plans to begin the
sessions tomorrow.

   "You're going to see a more active President Bush," said
the Kansas senator, who spoke to Mr. Bush over the weekend. A
White House spokesman later confirmed the invitation but
couldn't say whether the meetings would continue beyond this
week.
   Democrats have been clamoring for Mr. Bush to take a more
prominent role in the talks between administration officials
and a bipartisan contingent of 21 members of Congress. The
talks began in mid-May.
   Unless the pace picks up considerably, negotiators are
unlikely to meet their stated goal of reaching an agreement
in the next two or three weeks. Budget Director Richard
Darman has argued that a breakthrough will occur only in a
smaller group.
   Sen. Dole's aides said Mr. Bush's daily meetings will
include Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine),
House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), House Majority Leader
Dick Gephardt (D., Mo.), House Minority Leader Bob Michel
(R., Ill.) and Sen. Dole.
