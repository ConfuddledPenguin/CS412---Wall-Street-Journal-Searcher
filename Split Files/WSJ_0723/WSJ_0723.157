   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- McDonald's Corp. posted a 10% rise in
second-quarter net income, but the gain still failed to meet
Wall Street's earnings expectations, as domestic sales fell
victim to continuing vicious discounting by competitors.
   Apparently acknowledging the bites others in the fast-food
industry are taking out of its sales, the company said it is
weighing new menu strategies to woo customers. Such changes
could mean lower everyday prices on some items.

   McDonald's has sought to resist the discounting trend
spreading through the industry, but after reporting yet
another quarter with lower figures for same-store sales
(stores open at least one year), the company said, "We are
not satisfied with the current sales situation in the U.S."
   Nor were industry analysts. "It was a very disappointing"
quarter, said Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery Securities,
who like most analysts had been expecting McDonald's to
report per-share earnings of at least 60 cents. Instead, it
reported 59 cents a share. Perhaps more significantly, Mr.
Mueller calculated that real same-store sales domestically
have slipped 12% in the past two years.
   Although McDonald's didn't announce its results until just
before the market closed last Friday, its stock quickly fell
more than $1 a share, closing at $36, down $1.50 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   For the second quarter, McDonald's reported earnings of
$215.8 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with earnings
of $196 million, or 53 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue rose 9.9% to $1.7 billion from $1.55
billion. Systemwide sales, which include those of franchisees
and affiliates as well as company-operated stores, totaled
$4.6 billion for the latest quarter, up 7% from the
year-earlier figure of $4.3 billion.
   But on a per-store basis, both company and franchisee
units in the U.S. slipped in the latest quarter, continuing a
worrisome trend. Internationally, McDonald's continued to
ring up impressive sales and earnings gains.
   For the six months, net rose 11% to $373.9 million, or
$1.02 a share, from the year-earlier results of $337.7
million, or 90 cents a share, on a greater number of shares
outstanding. Revenue rose 10% to $3.23 billion from $2.93
billion.
   In the quarter, the average company store did about $4,000
less business than a year ago, while the average
franchisee-operated unit had about $10,000 fewer sales than
previously -- despite price increases this past February.
   McDonald's admission it was "considering several menu
strategies" indicates the concern with which the world's
largest fast-food operator views its situation. McDonald's
officials couldn't immediately elaborate on precisely what
those strategies might entail.
   But in its earnings announcement, McDonald's USA president
Edward H. Rensi said that McDonald's was "taking steps to
further enhance value for our customers." He said the company
is advertising its old staple, the Happy Meal for children,
for $1.99. The item, which includes a hamburger, small french
fries and drink, as well as a toy, normally sells for about
$2.29 in most markets.
   "It's a value-package price," a company spokesman said
yesterday. "The idea is to offer families a good value for
children."
   McDonald's has been reluctant to join the discounting
binge, in the belief that customer gains are fleeting. Still,
it has been forced to join the fray in certain markets where
cut-rate meals are the norm. "The main thing the heavy
fast-food user cares about is price," said Mr. Mueller, the
Montgomery analyst.
   PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell unit, has been among the leading
discounters, offering a slate of entrees priced at 59 cents.
