   Lone Star Industries Inc. reported that second-quarter net
income dropped 77%, largely because of tax benefits reflected
in year-earlier results.
   Earnings before taxes grew 67%, said the Stamford, Conn.,
maker of cement and other construction materials.

   Second-quarter net dropped to $1.5 million, or two cents a
share, from $6.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. The 1989 period included $5.6 million,
or 34 cents a share, of investment tax credits.
   Sales fell 26% to $71.2 million from $96.3 million. The
company has been shedding assets under a restructuring
program, and the latest quarter's sales figures don't reflect
a number of assets that the company is planning to sell.
   Lone Star is facing litigation over railroad cross ties
that it manufactured; purchasers have claimed the ties are
defective.
