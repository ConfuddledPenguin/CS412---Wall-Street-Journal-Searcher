   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.

   SYNOPTICS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. reported second-quarter
earnings of 34 cents a share, which was 19% greater than the
average estimate of analysts as compiled by Zacks Investment
Research. Because of a database error, SynOptics' earnings
were mistakenly listed as a negative surprise in the
Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in Friday's edition.
