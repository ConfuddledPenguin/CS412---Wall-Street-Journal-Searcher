   NEW YORK -- The dollar's slide to new lows against the
mark is expected to continue and traders say it is unclear
whether central banks will move to bolster the U.S. currency.
   Rumors of impending central bank intervention to prop up
the dollar ran through the currency markets last week as it
moved to a new postwar low of 1.5437 marks Thursday before
recovering slightly to 1.5495 marks late Friday, down more
than four pfennigs on the week.

   With the dollar's decline orderly, major central banks
haven't been seen intervening in the market.
   Currency market participants generally expect to see still
weaker dollar levels against the mark in coming weeks as
evidence of the U.S. economy's sluggishness continues to
mount.
   But since the dollar is in new territory, traders are
hesitant to predict just how low it might drop.
   "From a charting perspective, we're at previously unknown
levels," says Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader at
Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago. "I tend to feel that
1.50 deutsche marks is an obvious psychological support
level, and I think we could go another two or three pfennigs
lower."
   The dollar's recent slide has reflected a weakening U.S.
economy -- apparent in recent reports on declining housing
starts and falling auto sales.
   The forecast for the U.S. economy is so gloomy that even
the Iraq-Kuwait crisis -- which under other circumstances
would have drawn strong "flight-to-quality" support for the
dollar -- isn't giving much of a boost to the dollar.
   Andrew Rojek, international market analyst at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., agrees that the 1.50-mark level is a critical
one for the dollar, and that the dollar could push even below
that. "If we break 1.50 convincingly, I look for 1.4890 as
the next target," he says. "But it's hard to say because we
haven't been there, ever."
   In spite of the central bank intervention rumors that have
persisted in the foreign exchange markets, analysts say the
dollar's weakness may not prompt central banks to support the
currency.
   They note that the weak dollar is one of the few things
the U.S. economy has going for it as it helps boost U.S.
exports. "I imagine the Fed is quite happy with the weak
dollar," says Graham Beale, chief trader at Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York.
   But traders say that if the dollar's drop gets out of
control, the central banks could step in.
   "What the central banks don't want to see is disorderly
markets," says Mr. Woodland of Harris Trust. "Whether the
authorities intervene depends less on how low the dollar goes
than on how it gets there."
   "Sliding half a pfennig to pfennig at a time, as the
dollar has been" doesn't represent a disorderly situation,
Mr. Woodland says.
   Mr. Beale agrees: "I think it would take a breaking of
1.50 marks, very aggressively, to prompt Federal Reserve or
other central bank intervention."
   While the dollar has hit new lows against the mark, it is
faring better against the yen, which is still dogged by
market concerns about the Japanese inflation rate and the
effect of rising oil prices on the Japanese economy.
   But analysts believe the yen is due to climb higher.
Merrill Lynch's Mr. Rojek forecasts that the dollar could
fall to as low as 146.80 yen soon, down from 147.58 yen in
New York late Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
147.57 yen, up from Friday's close there of 147.35 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was at 1.5540 marks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $409.60 an ounce, up 40 cents.
Estimated volume was a very heavy seven million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$412.50 an ounce.
