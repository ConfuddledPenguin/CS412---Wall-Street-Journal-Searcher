   The company also restated its first-half sales to 10.91
billion francs, down 2% from 11.15 billion a year ago. Last
month, the company had reported first-half 1990 sales of
10.89 billion francs.
   The company blamed currency influences for the decline in
results.
   For the year as a whole, the company expects profit and
sales to come in somewhat lower than last year's levels. The
company posted 1989 group sales of 20.6 billion francs and
group net profit of 1.56 billion francs.
