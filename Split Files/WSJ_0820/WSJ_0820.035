   WASHINGTON -- U.S. imports of steel-mill products in June
were virtually the same as in May, but fell 5.4% from the
year-earlier month, according to an American Iron and
Institute compilation of Commerce Department figures.
   Imports in June totaled 1,466,413 tons, compared with
1,455,803 tons in May and 1,549,428 tons in June 1989, the
trade group said. For the first six months of 1990, imports
fell 9.2% to 7,896,842 tons.
