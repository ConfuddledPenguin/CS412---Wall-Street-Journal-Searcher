   The U.S. and Iraq edged closer to armed confrontation, as
U.S. naval vessels shadowed two Iraqi tankers believed to be
carrying outbound cargoes of oil, and Iraq vowed to hold
Western hostages until President Bush withdraws troops from
Saudi Arabia and ends economic sanctions.
   Over the weekend, the U.S. Navy fired warning shots across
the bows of the two tankers in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of
Oman. Neither tanker was stopped. But the incident --
involving the first shots fired by the U.S. in the Gulf
crisis -- underscored the growing volatility in the conflict
between the U.S. and Iraq.

   The Pentagon wouldn't say where the ships were headed, but
an administration official said he believed one tanker was
headed to Yemen. If the vessels continue their course, the
shipments would pose the toughest test of the effort to block
outbound cargoes from Iraq.
   President Bush interrupted his vacation in Kennebunkport,
Maine, yesterday and headed back to Washington to discuss the
Gulf crisis with senior aides at the White House. One item
expected to be on the agenda, according to officials, was how
many military reservists to call up to supplement the Bush
administration's massive buildup in the region. The president
hasn't yet signed an order calling up reserves.
   The U.S. determination to prevent the tankers from
unloading their cargo, thereby breaking the embargo, could
lead the U.S. to the brink of war. "I think we're about 70%
on our way to war" within the next several weeks, warned Paul
Jureidini, vice president of Abbott Associates, a
Washington-based Mideast consulting firm. Others say that the
odds may be slimmer, but the possibility of forcibly stopping
the tankers has increased the likelihood of a confrontation.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is visiting U.S. troops
and ships in the Gulf region, said that "our vessels continue
to maintain their surveillance" of the Iraqi ships. And he
emphasized that U.S. forces are authorized to stop cargo to
or from Iraq "by voluntary means and naval means if
necessary."
   At the same time that the U.S. is building up its military
presence, there are renewed efforts to try to resolve the
crisis without a military confrontation, according to people
in the Middle East close to the situation. One Mideast expert
with close connections in the region said that Jordan's King
Hussein is continuing talks with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to find ways to entice Iraq into withdrawing from
Kuwait.
   According to the Mideast expert, these discussions include
proposals that the Gulf countries write off Iraq's debts to
them, which total as much as $70 billion. Other ideas being
discussed include finding a way for Kuwait to "lease" to Iraq
two islands, Warbah and Bubiyan, that would give Baghdad
expanded access to the Persian Gulf, and searching for
formulas to share the oil fields beneath the Kuwait-Iraqi
border.
   Meanwhile, however, Iraq is reacting to the mounting U.S.
naval presence by warning that the 3,000 Americans and other
westerners being forcibly detained would be used as shields
to discourage American bombers from attacking Iraqi military
installations. Baghdad also has said that the foreigners
would suffer from any shortages of food or medicine resulting
from the international embargo of Iraq.
   Despite these repeated threats, U.S. officials generally
continued to shy away from the term "hostage," mindful of how
hostage crises hobbled the Carter and Reagan administrations.
Speaking yesterday on NBC News's "Meet the Press," Robert
Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs, said
that the word "has certain emotional elements to it, both
here and in the region." He reiterated that the U.S. goal is
"to get these people out and to take whatever steps we think
will contribute to that."
   Mr. Kimmitt added that the U.S. had no evidence that any
Americans had been moved to military or research sites that
could be targets of an American attack.
   For now, Iraq's Hussein is using the detained Americans to
try to manipulate U.S. public opinion. Yesterday Iraq offered
to let all foreigners go if President Bush provides written
guarantees that U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia are withdrawn and
if the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted. The message,
broadcast on Iraqi television yesterday, was described as an
open letter to the families of those being detained.
   Saddam Hussein also said that Iraq is immediately freeing
all detainees from Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and
Portugal, the Associated Press reported. People from those
countries account for fewer than 600 of the 21,000 Westerners
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, the AP said.
   The Iraqi president's tactic of attempting to go over the
heads of U.S. officials is similar to the one he used during
the last two weeks, when he called on Arabs to join Iraq in a
holy war against the West. Saddam Hussein is appealing --
with some success -- to the impoverished and resentful Arab
masses in such states as Jordan and Egypt who despise the
oil-rich Kuwaitis and believe that their leaders are U.S.
lackeys. Now, the Iraqi president is hoping to generate
pressure in the U.S. to test Mr. Bush's staying power.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Saddam
Hussein's offer "doesn't have much relationship at all to our
objectives. It contains no new relevant proposals, no
reference to the U.N. and Arab League calls for them {Iraqis}
to leave Kuwait."
   President Bush got a boost yesterday from two influential
Democrats in Congress, who said the U.S. needs to balance its
humanitarian concern for hostages against other American
interests in the region, such as the free flow of oil in the
gulf and stopping aggression to ensure regional stability.
   "You cannot let one interest predominate over these other
interests," said Rep. Lee Hamilton, (D., Ind.), chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Mideast. And
Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said that if U.S. citizens are harmed,
"we at least know the address of the person responsible, so
if we need to send a message we know where to send it."
   Defense Secretary Cheney, whose tour of the Middle East is
part of a full-court diplomatic press to isolate Saddam
Hussein from neighboring Arab countries, is offering to
provide military assistance to Bahrain and other Persian Gulf
kingdoms.
   Commanders of U.S. warships in the region -- carrying
wartime loads of air-to-air missiles, extra ammunition and
even specially armed units trained to board suspicious
vessels -- described cat-and-mouse games in the high seas to
interdict cargoes to or from Iraq.
   The heightened level of tension was evident throughout the
U.S. ships deployed here in the tropical haze about 50 miles
off the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia. Military officials
recounted at least 15 incidents in the past few days when
civilian vessels suspected of doing business with Iraq were
quizzed from a distance by radio or were intercepted by a
U.S. warship before heeding orders to change course.
   One indication of the administration's seriousness in
pursuing the sanctions is the fact that Navy ships have been
supplied with laminated plastic cards to give to civilian
crew members if ships are boarded. The cards, among other
things, urge civilians to "remain calm" but "drop to the deck
with your hands out-stretched" if fighting erupts.
   Mr. Cheney is scheduled to consult with officials in Oman,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. already bases
fighter planes in some of those small Persian Gulf kingdoms,
and officials said Mr. Cheney wants to discuss more extensive
military cooperation. The secretary told reporters: "They may
have a need for some short-term items" or long-term military
aid. "I would think everything is possible."
   As the situation continues to heat up, Pentagon officials
are finding new ways to move the massive force and integrate
it with the Saudi military. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams
announced that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia formally signed an
agreement, as expected, spelling out that American forces
will stay there only as long as the Saudis request.
   Friday, the Pentagon announced that it had ordered
commercial airlines to provide as many as 38 planes for
military purposes. This is the first time the Civil Reserve
Air Fleet has been activated since Congress created it in
1952, and the law gives the president and the secretary of
defense authority to order more commercial cargo and
passenger aircraft to help Operation Desert Shield.
   Meanwhile, sources in the aviation industry indicated that
the U.S. may soon supply Saudi Arabia with the most advanced
version of the F-15 fighter jet, built by McDonnell Douglas
Corp., St. Louis. The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday
that Mr. Cheney flew to Saudi Arabia last week to negotiate
an agreement for selling the F-15E Eagle.
   But Mr. Cheney told reporters that the Saudis haven't
specifically requested additional weapons and that the
Pentagon isn't close to locking up a major deal with any Arab
country.
