   FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. -- Newport Corp. said it
authorized the repurchase of one million of its common
shares, or about 14% of the total outstanding, from time to
time in the open market.
   The repurchase program is in addition to a
one-million-share buy-back program authorized in 1987. So
far, the maker of laser instruments and parts and accessories
for the optics market has repurchased 774,000 shares under
the earlier buy-back program.
