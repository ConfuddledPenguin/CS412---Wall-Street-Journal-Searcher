   NEW YORK -- Pierre Henchoz is going home.
   After four years as the chief investment officer of the $9
billion United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, Mr. Henchoz
resigned, effective Aug. 31, and will return to his native
Lausanne, Switzerland, to be chief executive officer and
principal of Hentsch, Chollet &amp; Cie., an old-line private
bank founded in 1882 by Lausanne's wealthy families. He also
will be an adviser to and a director of Eurovaleur Inc., a
new money management firm specializing in publicly traded
European stocks.

   The U.N. is expected to name a successor at the end of
this month.
   The 49-year-old veteran global money manager, who keeps a
small sketch of ancient Lausanne on the wall of his cramped,
functional office on the seventh floor of the U.N.
headquarters here, said that he always intended to return to
Switzerland and that he accepted an irresistible offer.
   Mr. Henchoz said he was drawn by "having to offer superior
services, being competitive and being ready to be compared
with all other international fund managers." For decades,
Swiss banks didn't have to compete aggressively for global
investment capital, which flowed in because of Switzerland's
secure neutral political position, secrecy laws and strong
currency. In today's sophisticated cross-border arena,
"Switzerland has to defend against this new challenge," Mr.
Henchoz said. "It's when you get competition that you have to
prove you are good."
   For the five years through March 31 -- the U.N.'s fiscal
year-end -- the U.N. pension fund had a total annual return
of 16.54% in U.S. dollar terms. A modest, unpretentious man,
Mr. Henchoz credited his predecessor for part of that
performance.
   The fund, with investments in 25 currencies in about 20
countries, is invested 42% in stocks, 40% in bonds, 12% in
real estate investment funds and 6% in cash. About half these
assets are invested outside the U.S., protecting the fund
somewhat against the dollar's recent decline.
   Mr. Henchoz also acknowledged luck's role. Days before he
applied for the U.N. job in 1986, Swiss citizens voted
against joining the organization. He said, "I always remember
saying to myself: `You will never get the job.'" He beat out
81 other applicants.
   He said his biggest achievement "was not to have lost my
nerves and lucidity on Oct. 20, 1987," the day after the
global stock market crash. "I realized that day the whole
dimension of my job, because I was between the trustee, who
is the secretary-general of the U.N., and the whole world's
financial markets." Mr. Henchoz bet on falling interest rates
and a weak dollar. He quickly began buying stocks and bonds,
and selling dollars for currencies such as the West German
mark and Japanese yen. The strategy paid off: In 1987, the
fund posted a 10.7% return.
   Now Mr. Henchoz is worried. Because of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and the world's sharp response, he said, "The whole
{investment} community is almost paralyzed, not knowing what
is going to happen." Thus, he adopted a relatively passive
strategy of lowering the prices at which the fund will buy
certain shares, of bargain-hunting, and of letting cash
accumulate to be able to pounce at the right moment. Still,
Mr. Henchoz said: "For the first time since I arrived at the
U.N., I am a passive person. Maybe it's the right strategy; I
don't know. It's a gamble."
   Through his staff of 18 people from a dozen countries who
speak at least 10 languages and the fund's investment
committee, Mr. Henchoz has always been able to turn to
somebody who understood well a particular political
situation. But now he concedes: "I have no Iraqis."
