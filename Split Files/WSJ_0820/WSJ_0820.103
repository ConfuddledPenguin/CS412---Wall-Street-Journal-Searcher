   Nordstrom Inc. said it agreed to settle charges of
violating several federal labor laws in its handling of a
dispute with the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union.
   In the tentative agreement with the National Labor
Relations Board, Nordstrom doesn't admit guilt, nor is it
required to pay a fine. But the retailer promised it wouldn't
allow certain alleged practices that resulted in charges the
labor board found to have potential merit. Those include
discrimination against employees taking part in union
activities and promising workers additional benefits if the
unions are decertified.

<TEXT>
   The violations stemmed from a yearlong dispute with the
United Food &amp; Commercial Workers locals 1001 and 367.
Contract talks with the two locals, whose pacts covering
Seattle-area salespeople expired last year, broke down after
the company proposed making union membership optional.
   A spokesman for the unions declined to comment on the
proposed settlement.
