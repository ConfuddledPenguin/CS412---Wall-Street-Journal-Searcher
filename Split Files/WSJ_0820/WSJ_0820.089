   TOKYO -- On the 14th floor of a government office building
here, young Japanese bureaucrats are quietly drawing up
blueprints for the economic future of Asia.
   This is the headquarters of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, or MITI, which helped guide
the postwar Japanese economic miracle. But in this particular
office, MITI is focusing on Japan's less-developed neighbors
to the south, especially Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and
the Philippines.

   Noboru Seki, the section chief, shows a visitor a stack of
recent studies -- MITI's economic plans for Malaysia. They
include blueprints for new industries ranging from rubber
sneakers to color-television picture tubes. The most
elaborate document, written in concert with Malaysian
planners, is 70 pages long and outlines, in astonishing
detail, MITI's plans to make Malaysia one of the world's
foremost producers of word processors, answering machines and
facsimile devices.
   "We deeply hope," says Mr. Seki with a smile, "that these
will be the most important industries in Malaysia."
   Always eager to study and coordinate, Japan's bureaucrats
are working overtime these days on the economic
transformation of the Asia-Pacific region -- with the
well-being of Japanese business and industry firmly in mind.
Some of these grand plans exist only on paper. Yet, Japanese
government aid is flooding into the region. So is Japanese
private investment, in the form of factories and joint
ventures. The Ministry of Finance estimates Japanese direct
investment in Asia will hit about $8 billion this year,
quadruple the level of 1986.
   More important than the amount of money is the methodical
and sophisticated manner in which it is being spent. Far from
using a case-by-case approach to foreign aid and investment,
Japanese government and corporate strategists speak about
shaping and even "coordinating" the economic development of
the region. Implicit in this view is a division of labor. For
example, as MITI sees it, Indonesia will pay special
attention to textiles, forest products and plastics. Thailand
will focus on furniture, toys and die-cast molds. And
Malaysia will concentrate on sneakers, copiers and television
picture tubes.
   "Laissez faire can't be recommended," says Nobuhito Hobo,
a mid-level official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"Careful utilization of market forces is always ideal."
   Metaphors for Japan's new role in Asia are multiplying.
Some people speak of Asia as a "flock of geese." Others,
including consultants to Japan's Economic Planning Agency,
talk of an "Asian brain," the center of which is in Tokyo.
   Whatever the imagery, the basic idea is pretty much the
same. Says Masayoshi Furuya, director of Japan Research
Institute, a Tokyo think tank: "We have to develop the Asian
countries."
   The development strategy works like this: First, Japanese
loans, mostly of government money, build up roads, bridges
and such. Second, the Japanese government sends technical
experts. Third, Japanese loans filter down to industry within
the Asian country, to finance joint ventures and other
business alliances. Fourth, Japan opens its doors to imports
from these offshore factories.
   Experts see in this the emergence of a regional Asian
economy. And some worry that these strategies may be the
foundation stones for a future protectionist trading bloc.
   The surge of Japanese investment has met with mixed
reactions in Asia. On the one hand, the Asian nations, hungry
for jobs, can prosper mightily from an infusion of Japanese
technology and money. "We have 200,000 young people leaving
school each year," says Sapuan Amir, a director of the
Malaysian Industrial Development Authority. "We need to
create 200,000 jobs a year just to stay even, and we already
have an unemployment rate of 7.9%."
   On the other hand, Japan's emergence as a regional
powerhouse conjures up painful memories for many Asians,
particularly the older ones who remember Japan's wartime
pronouncements on a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
As early as the 1930s, military strategists in Tokyo had
talked of gaining control of Southeast Asia's vast natural
resources. Back then, Japan envisioned the entire Pacific
region woven into a cohesive economy, with Southeast Asia
serving as the source of raw materials and a vast consumer
market.
   The Co-Prosperity Sphere formally became part of Japan's
war plans, and Japan would soon invade Vietnam, Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Decades
later, resentment and suspicion of Japan remain close to the
surface in many Asian nations -- including those hungry for
investment. In the early 1980s, when Japan revised its
textbooks to minimize its coercive wartime rule, other Asians
protested vehemently. "The period of Japanese presence in
East and Southeast Asia was indisputably one of extreme
suffering for people in the region," wrote one Malaysian to
the Far East Economic Review, a weekly magazine. "The attempt
. . . to whitewash this history further adds to the
injustice."
   Lingering fears about overdependence on Japan have
prompted many current Asian leaders to seek American and
European investment as a counterweight.
   Still, Japanese businesses are finding plenty of
opportunities to expand into Asia. Nikken Sekkei, Japan's
largest architectural-design firm, for example, recently won
a fierce competition to design a major office tower in Seoul,
South Korea. More Korean business is flowing in and the
company has opened an office in Singapore to tap markets
there, says Kimiaki Minai, the company's president.
   Mr. Minai downplays fears that Japan is out to dominate
the rest of the region. "First of all, we are Asians," he
says.
   First among the Asians is probably closer to the mark. As
a society that is rank conscious and hierarchical, Japan
finds it easy to think of Asia as an economic hierarchy of
nations. And Japan is, naturally, No. 1.
   Or to use the flock-of-geese image, Japan is the lead
goose, followed in close formation by newly industrialized
nations like Taiwan and South Korea, and then developing
countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Behind them is giant
China. The fifth rank is an embryonic membership in the
flock: India, Vietnam and Bangladesh.
   At least some Japanese bureaucrats are eager to limit
competition between these countries, and private industry is
already making an effort to foster complementary patterns of
development. A regional auto industry, for example, might
combine transmissions made in the Philippines with steering
mechanisms built in Malaysia and engines from Thailand. Each
country would then do final assembly. Toyota Motor Corp. is
already moving rapidly in this direction.
   The new Asia strategy has another notable feature: It
helps Japan trim its trade surplus with the U.S. Moving
production offshore means shifting elements of that $49
billion annual trade surplus out of Japan, even if many of
the factories remain Japanese-controlled. So Tokyo wins
points with U.S. politicians worried about the trade deficit.
   But this is what John Stern, of the American Electronics
Association in Tokyo, calls an "export shell game." He notes
that last year Japan's exports of consumer electronics to the
U.S. dropped 21% to $4.2 billion. Thailand's exports to the
U.S. rocketed 2000% to $162 million -- largely because of
production there by Japanese and joint-venture producers.
   Some of this Japanese investment goes back a long way, but
the big wave began building in 1987, when then-Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone announced a $20 billion foreign aid program
and earmarked $2 billion for the development of private
industry in Asia. About the same time, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry initiated a New Asian
Industries Development Plan (New AID), which amounted to a
blueprint for Japanese industry to set up offshore
production.
   Japanese officials are touchy about appearing too well
coordinated in their thinking. They stress that MITI's plan
isn't official Japanese policy.
   "This is the Japanese first line of defense: They say the
New AID plan is MITI's policy, it isn't Japan's policy," says
David Arase, a professor at Pomona College in California.
"But there is a large degree of cross-fertilization. There is
a lot of de facto coordination."
   Japanese officials concede, for example, that the
infrastructure planning for Thailand is done with the
knowledge that Japanese industry is lining up to invest
there, and that Thailand's current infrastructure is bursting
at the seams. More roads and ports will be needed to handle
the new business.
   The MITI plan was designed to be a timely helping hand for
Japanese industry, which was buffeted by a sharply rising yen
between 1985 and 1988, and by soaring land prices and a
worsening labor shortage. This last problem has forced
Japanese companies to import immigrant labor -- a
controversial step in xenophobic Japan -- or take the work to
cheaper labor markets overseas.
   Hitachi, Matsushita, Toyota and others have thus begun
increasing production in Southeast Asia, and their smaller
suppliers have followed them overseas. Today, small- and
medium-sized companies in many industries are rushing into
Southeast Asia in a stampede of investment. Last March, a
Japanese survey of 9,000 smaller companies showed that 2,500
of them were planning to invest overseas, and almost 60% of
these were planning to invest in Southeast Asia. Thailand is
the most popular destination, followed by Indonesia and
Malaysia.
   At the Indonesian Embassy on the outskirts of central
Tokyo, Soeprapto Herijando waits with outstretched arms. He
recently set up a special reception room to handle the flow
of inquiring Japanese businessmen. "In two months, more than
100 visitors," says Mr. Herijando, proudly showing a visitor
a large room with an elaborately carved Indonesian sofa and
wing chairs. "The telephone calls," he adds, "number in the
thousands."
   But Indonesia more than most has also discovered that
Japanese investment -- as any foreign investment -- can be a
mixed blessing. Consider the country's Asahan project, a $2.7
billion complex that includes dams, power transmission and a
giant aluminum smelter. Asahan has created 2,000 jobs,
electricity for a town, and aluminum to export to Japan and
elsewhere. For Japan, Asahan (41%-owned by the Indonesian
government, 59% by Japanese interests) is a monument to
Japan-Indonesian cooperation.
   Yet the project has been, at times, a financial nightmare.
The plant's exports are largely denominated in dollars, but
its loans are mostly in Japanese yen. When the yen rose
sharply between 1985 and 1988, Indonesia was caught in a
squeeze, unable to generate enough export revenue to repay
its costly yen-based loans. Japan had to cough up several new
loans, totaling more than $1 billion in 1987 alone.
   Then in 1988 the Indonesian side of the joint venture
angrily shut off aluminum shipments to Japan for five months
because it wanted more of the smelter's output. Other
disagreements followed.
   "When I visited Asahan, I got big complaints from the
Japanese working there," says Tsuneo Fujita, a high-ranking
official of the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund,
an investor in the project. "They kept losing {workers},
after making strenuous efforts to train them."
   The recipient countries have their own complaints.
Japanese reluctance to install local managers is a frequent
source of conflict. "U.S. companies have readily appointed
locals in top positions in Malaysia; Japan hasn't," says M.
Suppiah, a Malaysian in charge of attracting American
companies to his country. Moreover, Japan is often criticized
for being stingy about transfering technology to fledgling
Southeast Asian industries.
   Some Japanese executives admit they fear wholesale
technology transfer for simple competitive reasons. Toshio
Oda, managing director of Nissho Iwai, the giant Japanese
trading house, which has 70 joint ventures in Asia, says his
company has to be careful. "Otherwise," he says, "it's just a
giveaway of technology. The difficulty is when we can't
control the management," he says. "Investment means having
some control when we invest."
   In all likelihood, these problems will work themselves out
over time, given the incentives. Japan is keen to gain from
closer economic cooperation, and so, too, are the nations of
Southeast Asia. And therein lies a remarkable historical
twist: What Japan was unable to do with military force 50
years ago, it is achieving today through its money, diplomacy
and technical skill.
