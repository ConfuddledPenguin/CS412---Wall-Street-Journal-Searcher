   NEW YORK -- It's a money manager's nightmare --
uncertainty.
   With war clouds gathering in the Mideast and the economy
hanging by a thread, many money managers are desperately
groping for a way to deal with a loose cannon, Iraq's
unpredictable dictator Saddam Hussein. And the longer the
stalemate in the Mideast lasts, the more nervous money
managers grow.

   "This is probably the most difficult situation I've had to
deal with in my 21 years in the business," says Ray Hirsch,
senior portfolio manager at IDS Financial Services.
"Investment strategy is being made in the Middle East right
now," says Peter Canelo of Bear Stearns, whose long-running
bullish view is losing some of its conviction. "Clients
aren't terribly interested in economic and interest-rate
forecasts because they know $40-a-barrel oil will change all
those forecasts."
   So what to do? Some managers say they are sitting tight;
in other words, they are paralyzed. But others, at least, are
taking action, expecting the stock market to decline further.
   The most popular activist approach is to raise cash,
taking profits in expensive growth stocks and selling
anything especially vulnerable in an economic downturn.
Portfolio managers who don't have the option of greatly
increasing cash are shifting into utilities, companies with
low price-earnings ratios, domestic oil companies, oil-field
service companies and defense issues.
   Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns has raised his average cash
position he recommends to clients to about 12%. For
institutions where there is no limit to how much of the
portfolio can be in cash, 50% might be the right number, he
says. He thinks the stock market is headed lower.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.6%
below its peak of 2999.75; a drop of more than 10% meets a
commonly accepted definition for the end of a stock market
rally, in this case, the one that began Dec. 4, 1987. On
Friday, the industrial average extended the decline an
additional 36.64 points to 2644.80. Many managers are groping
for a bottom. An often-repeated number is 2500, but that
keeps changing.
   Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns, for example, spoke Friday of
2640 as a possible support level. Minutes later, the
industrial average sunk briefly to about 2620, and Mr. Canelo
was raising the possibility of a 2500 bottom -- 2400 if oil
goes over $30 a barrel, 2200 at $50 a barrel.
   A.C. Moore, research director at Argus Research, says the
stock market won't look fairly valued until about 2550. He
sees oil prices staying below $30 a barrel. That would lead
to a recession, but not a deep or long one, he says.
   "It's important to raise cash if you haven't already," Mr.
Moore says. He recommends a 60-40 stocks-to-cash ratio in an
all-stocks portfolio and a 40-30-30 mix in a stock-bonds-cash
account. He says the stock portion should include domestic
oil companies such as Phillips Petroleum and Atlantic
Richfield, natural gas companies such as Enron, Sonat and
Transco, oil-service providers such as Halliburton and
Schlumberger, and some gold stocks, including Echo Bay Mines
and Pegasus Gold.
   Not everyone, however, is willing to accept the idea that
the bull market has finally died. Mr. Hirsch of IDS says: "We
have broken the back of the bull leg, but I'm not saying
we're in a bear market yet." He believes the market would
have to hit 2300 to 2400 before he would be convinced a bear
market was in full swing. Still, the international
environment makes his job tough.
   Mr. Hirsch has nearly doubled the cash level in the $160
million Discovery stock fund he manages to about 16%. "The
likelihood of a long-term stalement {in the Mideast} has
risen sharply in the last week," he says. Mr. Hirsch isn't
buying any stocks right now. He is simply selecting the best
candidates to hold and selling the rest. If warranted, he has
the flexibility to go as much as 35% into cash. Currently, he
is betting on a long-term stalemate in the Mideast and a
subsequent continuing rise in oil prices.
   Some examples of what he is selling: Boeing, which may
face a slowdown in commercial aircraft orders due to higher
fuel costs, and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, which
operates turnpike restaurants. He is holding some service and
health care companies.
   Not surprisingly, Abby Joseph Cohen, who has been bearish
for some time, believes a bear market is here. "This is for
real," says Mrs. Cohen, chief strategist for Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Research. Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, she was
recommending that an account normally 60% in stocks be cut
back to 40%, with 25% in cash. She, too, thinks that stocks
won't become appealing until the industrial average hits
2500, and even then, that's not a definite buy signal.
   "If investors are increasingly worried about the direction
of the economy when the market gets to that fair-value
level," she says, "fair value won't matter. Just as stocks
can get overvalued, they can get undervalued" before a
rebound occurs.
   Not all money managers are befuddled by events in the
Mideast. James Awad of BMI Capital believes that the turmoil
will all be resolved by Christmas, and the investor who hangs
in there in the meantime will make money.
   "I am willing to make the leap of faith that in perceived
financial panics, those who have been guided by greed --
rather than fear -- made money, so I'm buying stocks," he
says. Specifically, he's buying high-quality, medium-sized
growth stocks such as Claire's Stores, Fingerhut, National
Health Labs and Duty Free International.
   "It's very difficult to make that leap of faith," Mr. Awad
adds, "because it's very easy to become emotionally paralyzed
and do some selling rather than buying. . . . Someday, the
system may fail, and I'll look back and say I wish I had a
bar of gold, some dried food, a machine gun and a hut in
country. But I believe the world tends to fix itself and goes
on."
   Another money manager bucking the flight to cash is Frank
A. Cappiello Jr., president of San Francisco-based
McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello. "Going into cash as much as
you can is dangerous," he says. "You have to pay an exit fee,
and figuring out when to go back in requires terrific
timing." Most of the safe-haven stocks, he says, have already
been picked over. His solution is to buy growth stocks that
have already been pounded in the recent sell-offs. He cites
Wal-Mart and Boeing as examples.
   "I'm buying stocks that have been overly discounted," Mr.
Cappiello says. "You have to have a one-year view now."
   "Whatever you do," says Argus Research's Mr. Moore, "never
panic. There's always a strategy. A true professional never
gets paralyzed."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East
continued to hammer stocks, with prices dropping broadly and
sharply in heavy trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 36.64 to 2644.80, its lowest level since March 1. The
loss for the week was 71.78, or 2.6% -- a fifth consecutive
weekly decline.
   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index tumbled 4.56, or
1.37%, to 327.83, the New York Stock Exchange composite index
dropped 2.54, or 1.39%, to 180.19 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index fell 4.42, or 1.43% to 303.74.
   Declining stocks routed advancers, 1,330 to 310, on the
Big Board, with oil issues dominating the list of gainers as
nervousness about the Middle East sent oil prices soaring.
   Activity was brisk amid fears that the Mideast situation
might boil over during the weekend. By early afternoon the
industrial average was off 63 points before staging a partial
recovery.
   Activity from the closeout of August stock-index futures
and options at the close pushed Big Board volume to a hefty
212,560,000 shares, up from 138,850,000 shares Thursday.
   The American Stock Exchange volume totaled 16,120,895
shares compared with 14,156,640 Thursday. There were 140
issues advancing, 468 declining and 199 unchanged.
   With the latest setback, the industrial average is down
354.95 points, or 11.8%, from its all-time closing high of
2999.75, set just one month earlier. The year's low of
2543.24 was set Jan. 30.
   Boeing retreated 2 1/8 to 48 1/2 in Big Board composite
trading of 3.8 million shares. The commercial-aircraft
business is softening after a two-year spending spree by jet
buyers, The Wall Street Journal reported.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped 7/8 to 33 3/8,
while Eastman Kodak went down 1 5/8 to 40 3/4 on 2.4 million
shares. Other blue-chip issues to be hit especially hard
included Coca-Cola, which went down 1 1/4 to 23 5/8 Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber, down 7/8 to 24 1/4, and Allied-Signal, down 1
1/4 to 30 3/8.
   Oil stocks rallied along with oil prices, which surged as
much as $1.35 a barrel in New York trading. Exxon rose 3/8 to
52 1/8 on 2.5 million shares, Texaco advanced 1 5/8 to 63
7/8, Chevron climbed 1 1/8 to 78 5/8, USX gained 3/8 to 32
1/2, Unocal went up 1 1/8 to 33 7/8 and Atlantic Richfield
added 2 1/2 to 137 1/2.
   Precious-metals issues held firm as the price of gold did
the same. Homestake Mining rose 1/8 to 23, Battle Mountain
Gold added 1/8 to 13, Hecla Mining finished unchanged at 13,
Placer Dome finished unchanged at 19 1/2 and American Barrick
Resources rose 5/8 to 24 1/8.
   James River climbed 1 1/8 to 24 after disclosing its plans
to restructure into four major product groups and post a $140
million to $150 million charge for the fiscal quarter ended
July 29.
   Fluor dropped 2 1/4 to 38 3/8 amid worries that the Middle
East conflict could jeopardize Saudi Arabia's
multibillion-dollar expansion of its oil-production
facilities, for which Fluor is a major contractor.
   Par Pharmaceutical fell 7/8 to 5 3/4, making it among the
biggest percentage losers on the Big Board. The company
posted a loss for the June quarter and said it expects to
record a loss for both the next two quarters and the fiscal
year ending next month.
   Geo. A. Hormel slid 1 1/8 to 15 1/8. The company reported
that net income for the fiscal quarter ended last month
dropped 12% from a year earlier.
   Several single-country mutual fund issues also posted
especially sharp losses, reflecting weakness in foreign stock
markets. Mexico Fund fell 1 1/8 to 14 1/8, Growth Fund of
Spain lost 5/8 to 9, Brazil Fund slid 7/8 to 9, Thai Fund
lost 1 1/4 to 19 1/4 and New Germany Fund fell 7/8 to 11 3/8.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
3.22 to 333.61, with the average price per share going down
11 cents. The index posted a 1.7% loss for the week and now
stands at its lowest level since April 1989.
   Put warrants on foreign stock indexes, which allow their
holders to profit when the measures drop in value, dominated
the list of Amex advancers. PaineWebber's put warrants on the
Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks was the exchange's most
active issue and went up 1/4 to 5 3/4.
