   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- The New Jersey Casino Control
Commission delayed a decision on Donald Trump's $65 million
bank bailout until tomorrow and approved Merv Griffin's plan
to have Resorts International Inc. emerge from bankruptcy-law
protection.
   Following the commission's meeting Friday, Mr. Trump's
lawyers said they doubted the delay would cause any of about
90 banks participating in Mr. Trump's restructuring to
withdraw approval.

   Should the commission reject the bailout tomorrow, it will
come as a major surprise and a setback to Mr. Trump who,
documents prepared by his accounting firm show, needs the $65
million to continue day-to-day operations.
   If the bank deal is completed, Mr. Trump is expected next
to tackle a restructuring of $1.3 billion in casino bonds he
issued to finance his Atlantic City empire. "I expect war
with the bondholders," Mr. Trump said Friday. "But I think
things will work out well for both sides."
   For Mr. Griffin, the commission's action marks a possible
turning point in his ill-fated foray into the casino
business. Mr. Griffin purchased Resorts in 1988 after a
takeover battle with Mr. Trump. Within less than a year, the
company failed to make interest payments on about $925
million in junk bond debt and was forced to seek
bankruptcy-law protection. Adding to Mr. Griffin's troubles,
Mr. Trump was quoted frequently saying he had bested Mr.
Griffin in their negotiations.
   Included in the Resorts plan is a $5 million litigation
trust fund to pursue possible lawsuits against Mr. Trump
stemming from the Resorts sale.
   Mr. Griffin said he harbored no animosity toward Mr. Trump
and wished him well through his current troubles. "The irony
of the whole thing is that it boiled down to today, in the
same room," Mr. Griffin said. "How did he end up in such
trouble in the morning and me in such great shape in the
afternoon?"
   Mr. Griffin will pay a significant price for getting out
of bankruptcy-law protection. Under the restructuring plan
put together by Salomon Brothers Inc., Mr. Griffin will cede
about 78% of the equity in the company to bondholders and put
up an additional $28.5 million. As part of its plan, the
company intends to sell its Paradise Island property in the
Bahamas.
   In addition to the new equity, some bondholders will
receive deferred interest notes that will alleviate the
company's debt burden and allow it to accumulate cash.
   "They're not out of the woods yet, but the deal will help
stabilize the company," said Kaye Handley, an analyst with
Sass Lamle &amp; Rubin who specializes in distressed securities.
