   EXXON Corp. (New York) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
reaffirmed Exxon's long-term debt rating despite a recent
announcement that the company had challenged in tax court an
Internal Revenue Service tax assessment of $6.5 billion. The
long-term debt rating of Exxon and its related entities was
affirmed at triple-A and commercial paper at single-A-1-plus,
S&amp;P said. S&amp;P said given the oil company's "superior
financial strength," the assessment doesn't affect Exxon's
credit quality.
