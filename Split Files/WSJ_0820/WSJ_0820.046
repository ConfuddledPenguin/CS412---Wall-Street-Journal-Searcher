   After reading Bryan Jamison's July 30 Manager's Journal on
the vicissitudes of trying to buy a small business, I, as a
one time seller, feel compelled to offer a view from the
other side.
   For three years our employee-owned plastics processing
company of 60 souls was courted by scores of business brokers
and "interested parties" large and small, rich and poor,
responsible and wild, sincere and just curious. Eventually we
grew weary of the strain of baring our audited figures,
customer lists and manufacturing facilities. Most lookers
were seeking the impossible: a guaranteed future of
ever-increasing sales and profits to the end of time. Then,
as we were about to give up, serendipity intervened: The
right outfit came along from out of nowhere.

   Our 20-year-old company prepared a bound sheaf explaining
virtually anything a buyer would want to know about us --
including an unadulterated history, graphs of the industry's
fortunes over the same period, quarter-by-quarter financial
statements, 10 years of audited figures, a business biography
of each staff member, and five years of "realistic" sales and
profit projections. Even so, after flying thousands of miles,
often in corporate jets, most prospective buyers who sat in
my office to make a deal were more often than not
disbelieving, suspicious, or at best, skeptical. A few
secretly questioned my employees to find out whether I told
the truth.
   Virtually every prospective buyer asked the same three
questions:
   -- Why are you selling if the company is doing so well?
   During the most recent five years sales grew at a 10% rate
with profits at 12% to 15% on sales. I was approaching 60
(but looking younger) and ready to retire with no family to
take over. In the event of my death my wife was ill-fitted to
run the company. Nor would she do as well selling it as I
hoped I would. To those who seemed unconvinced, I bluntly
added that the right time to sell is at the highest point,
while the company is prospering. This always worked.
   -- Wouldn't the company fall apart without you at the
helm?
   For the prior three years a capable, well-organized staff
made all the day-to-day decisions without my guidance. I
confined myself to major policy and keeping track of morale.
But no one bought my story. How could I prove that in
preparing for a future sale I had succeeded in making myself
almost superfluous?
   -- The third question, really a series of related
questions, would arrive late in the exploratory process. How
firm is the asking price? (Answer: fairly firm.) Will you
take paper? (Answer: no.) Will you stay aboard and accept a
salary as part of the deal? (Answer: no.)
   Buyers tend to dance around the core questions. Bring them
up at the beginning and buyers will change the subject. But
when they're finally asked and must be addressed, the
dreamers and bargain hunters reveal themselves.
   Mr. Jamison discusses the "exorbitant asking price"
according to "the more than meets the eye approach." But the
right price is not the same to every buyer. A perceived need
adds to value. Our asking price was based on the prevailing
industry multiple, as best we could determine, of the average
of our past five years' after-tax earnings. Fair, rational,
like the stock market? Yet it really bothered me that many
offers were made based on book value alone, as if the
intangibles -- such as the struggle to build an organization,
our years of trial and error, our technical expertise, our
reputation and industry contacts, our unique culture --
didn't count.
   Oh, there were some who yearned to own "a gem, a find, an
ideal fit" like us. They wooed us over a dozen visits, and
besieged us daily on the phone, yet couldn't bring themselves
to commit.
   When an owner tells Mr. Jamison, "the business really
makes a lot more money than what is shown on the statements,
but he or she wants to keep taxes down so not everything gets
reported," he may well be telling the truth. Many
small-business owners whisper to friends that they've cheated
the IRS out of fortunes. Common ploys are to expense what
should be capitalized or have maintenance employees do
repairs on your home.
   What constitutes the true profit figure? That is typically
the most controversial question. Being closely held, we were
in the habit of keeping our bottom line to a minimum to avoid
-- for one thing -- doubly taxed dividends. Therefore, we
distributed a share of our pre-tax profits (beyond that which
we retained for reinvestment and operating capital) as
salaries and production incentive bonuses, and as
contributions to the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
But we failed to convince most prospects that such sums
would, under their circumstances, drop to the bottom line
rather than appear as costs. Yet they had to admit that a
division vice president could be hired to run the company for
less than half my salary.
   Mr. Jamison's negative experience with brokers is exactly
opposite to ours. The ones we encountered were sophisticated,
supportive and realistic. They usually brought forth
candidates who were a feasible fit and who professed a
willingness to consider our terms. Only one broker, whom we
refused, wanted a ridiculous up-front fee without even a
guarantee of performance. And one persisted in smoking cigars
in my office despite a posted "Thank you for not smoking"
sign.
   How ironic that the valid buyer who finally appeared
turned out to be a neighbor. No broker was involved. The deal
actually was born three years earlier when by chance I
happened to meet the chairman of a semi-competitive company
at a local lunch counter. If ever I decided to sell I should
look him up, he said. At the time it was out of the question,
and I forgot our discussion.
   But he hadn't. And when the word of our interest in
selling reached him, he sent his emissary. After three months
of relaxed and free-wheeling negotiation, I discovered what
our real priorities were. We found ourselves more flexible
about price than we anticipated. Indeed, the structure of the
deal, the fact that it would be for cash -- a stock, not an
asset, purchase -- that the factory building would go with
the business at a fair price, and that the buyer intended to
retain all employees and invest in the acquisition rather
than exploit it as a cash cow, these conditions turned out to
be as important as price. After both parties compromised on
the final figure the deal was done in less than a month.
   Good luck, Mr. Jamison, in your search. And expect to be
surprised.
