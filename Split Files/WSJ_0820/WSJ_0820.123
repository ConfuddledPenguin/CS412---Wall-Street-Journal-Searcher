   First Executive Corp. won a victory for the moment in its
effort to keep secret the details of consulting work that the
Los Angeles insurance holding company has said affirms its
financial strength.
   The ruling by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate
Division, bars the New York State Department of Insurance
from releasing certain actuarial reports until a full appeal
can be heard -- likely sometime in November -- said a lawyer
for Joseph Belth, the publisher of a newsletter and a
frequent critic of First Executive. Mr. Belth is seeking the
reports under New York state freedom of information law.

   First Executive has said that it will release the reports,
together with certain updated information, by the end of this
month. However, the company has at the same time opposed Mr.
Belth's efforts to gain access to copies of the reports that
are on file with New York insurance regulators. Friday's
court ruling makes it unclear whether First Executive will
hold to its timetable, announced in court earlier this month,
or whether it will continue to oppose public dissemination of
the reports.
   The company at first opposed all disclosure of the
reports. It later said it needed time to prepare what it has
called the updated information to accompany the documents,
which were prepared earlier this year by Milliman &amp;
Robertson, consulting actuaries, at the request of California
regulators but paid for by First Executive. The studies,
summaries of which have been made public, subject the
company's troubled insurance units to various hypothetical
adverse financial scenarios.
   First Executive has told a variety of audiences, ranging
from clients to a congressional committee that the reports
support its assertions of sufficient financial strength. A
company spokesman Friday failed to respond to a request for
comment on the New York court decision.
