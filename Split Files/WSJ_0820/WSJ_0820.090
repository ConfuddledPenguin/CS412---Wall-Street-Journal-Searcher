   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- P. Arunasalam's grandmother had
some advice for him when he began working for Furukawa
Electric Co.'s Malaysian subsidiary in 1972. "You have to be
very careful about the Japanese," she warned.
   She was speaking from experience, albeit dated. Her
husband was among the thousands of ethnic Tamils, mostly
rubber plantation workers, who were rounded up by Japanese
occupation forces during World War II and forced to work on
the Siam-Burma railway, better known as the Death Railway.

   Her husband, like tens of thousands of other Malaysians
and prisoners of war, would die building the railway. Mr.
Arunasalam says those who survived told his grandmother that
her husband, a devout Hindu, refused to eat the rotten beef
offered by his Japanese army overseers. "So they beat and
bayonetted him, and left him dying for three days" along the
banks of the River Kwai, he recounts.
   This sort of tale is common in Southeast Asia, where
Japan's military and economic expansion 50 years ago left an
indelible mark. Memories of the war are keen here. But
conversations with Malaysian workers also suggest that
Southeast Asians have largely come to terms with history --
and the growing number of Japanese employers in their region.
Mr. Arunasalam, for one, spent 17 years at Furukawa and was
thankful for his job.
   Clearly there is still suspicion and resentment of Japan.
Recently, the Malaysian foreign minister expressed his
concern that Japan may fill the void left behind by cuts in
U.S. and Soviet military operations in the region. His
comments created a diplomatic stir.
   Yet there is also admiration for the Japanese,
particularly among younger Malaysians who see in Japan an
economic machine that has invested billions in Southeast Asia
and helped transform subsistence agrarian economies into
bustling industrial enclaves. With that investment have come
jobs, a rising living standard and an inclination to look to
Japan as an economic role model.
   "My parents suffered during the Japanese time," says
Manickan Thagarajan, who makes semiconductors at NEC Corp.'s
plant near here, "but these days they never much worry about
the old time."
   In the early 1980s, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad even initiated a "Look East" policy, and decided that
the Malaysian economy could gain from studying at Japan's
knee. Mr. Mahathir, who lived through the Japanese occupation
and was forced to hawk bananas to help support his family,
found many of his countrymen baffled when he announced his
program. His critics worried it would benefit Japanese far
more than Malaysians.
   But the Look East policy caught hold. Initially aimed at
inculcating Japan's work ethic in Malaysia, it soon led to a
national desire for things Japanese, and to a major expansion
of Japanese investment here.
   In recent years, Japan has been the biggest foreign source
of manufacturing investment in Malaysia. In 1989 alone,
Japanese companies invested about $1 billion in the country,
according to the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. was one of the first to
come, arriving in the mid-1960s. Today it has 11 Malaysian
plants employing 11,000 workers.
   Those workers often complain about management's insistence
on high production targets and demands for overtime work. But
their jobs are more secure than most, and they include plenty
of interaction between the executive suite and the shop
floor.
   "Employees can suggest anything from A to Z," says Abdul
Manab Mohamed Kassim, president of the Electrical Industry
Workers' Union and a longtime employee of Matsushita
Electric. The company, he says, has set up suggestion
committees and quality circles and pays attention to minor
personnel matters, such as announcing employee birthdays, in
a way that bolsters worker morale. "These days," Mr. Manab
adds, "if managers are disliked by employees, they often are
sent back" to Japan.
   Malaysian workers, however, echo the complaints of
governments throughout the region that Japanese companies,
more than others, restrict the transfer of technology to
subsidiaries in Southeast Asia and lag behind in building
research and development facilities in the region.
   "I worked for a cable company for 17 years," says Mr.
Arunasalam, who made electric and telephone cables for
Furukawa before leaving to take a union post. "But I can't
tell you how a cable is made from start to finish."
   When he went to Japan in 1980 to visit Furukawa's Tokyo
headquarters he was barred from entering one of its plants,
he says. "The plant was working on optic fibers. And I was
told that it was top secret, even for someone like me, who
had been with the company for so many years."
