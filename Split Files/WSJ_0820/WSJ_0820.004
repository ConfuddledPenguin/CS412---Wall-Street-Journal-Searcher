   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc.'s agreement to sell
its interests in four investment partnerships to Krupp Cos.
for as much as $45 million in cash and notes collapsed.
   The failure to reach a final agreement appears to remove a
big hurdle to CRI Inc.'s proposed hostile tender offer for
the partnerships, known as American Insured Mortgage
Investors. CRI is a real estate investment firm based in
Rockville, Md.

   Integrated is seeking to sell its general partnership
interest, which was valued at about $25 million in the Krupp
agreement, as well as its right to manage the partnerships.
Integrated estimates it receives management fees of about $8
million a year, before costs. If CRI's bid succeeds,
Integrated would lose the right to the management fees.
   The sale of Integrated's interests in the AIM
partnerships, which was being conducted through a
court-approved auction, is part of Integrated's effort to
raise cash to satisfy claims of creditors, who are owed a
total of about $1.8 billion.
   Although substantive issues between Integrated and Krupp
had been resolved, the deal dissolved, Krupp said, when
Integrated rejected a provision permitting Krupp's lender to
reassess its commitment if further litigation arose before
closing.
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman, said he wasn't
sure how Integrated would proceed. "We have several avenues
to pursue," he said, including negotiating with others who
had expressed interest, and offering investors possible
changes in the management contract that would make it more
difficult to remove the manager. Mr. Weinroth wouldn't rule
out negotiating with CRI.
   Laurence Gerber, president of Krupp, a Boston real estate
investment manager, said, "The failure to consummate this
deal will result in investors being the biggest losers." He
said it was unlikely another agreement with Integrated would
be reached.
   CRI is proposing to gain control of the partnerships by
approaching investors directly and offering to exchange units
in two ventures it manages for the AIM units. A CRI spokesman
said the firm filed lawsuits in state courts in Delaware and
California last week to obtain a list of AIM investors.
   The CRI spokesman said CRI would proceed with its proposed
offer, which it filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in June, as soon as it receives the lists and SEC
clearance. CRI also has filed lawsuits to force Integrated to
reverse changes in its management contracts on the
partnerships.
