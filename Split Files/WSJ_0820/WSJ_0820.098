   Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn., said it will stop
distribution of its products in South Africa, effective July
1991.
   Xerox currently sells copiers and other office equipment
in the racially divided country through Xeratech Ltd., a
former subsidiary of Rank Xerox Ltd., the England-based joint
venture Xerox owns with the Rank Organisation PLC. Rank Xerox
sold that operation, formerly known as Rank Xerox South
Africa, to a local company three years ago, signing a
distribution agreement that could be ended with a year's
notice from either party.

   A Xerox spokesman said the decision to stop distribution
in South Africa was made "in the best interests of the entire
Xerox organization." While he declined to put a dollar amount
on sales to Xeratech, he said the decision would have "no
financial effect of any consequence" on Xerox. When Rank
Xerox South Africa was sold in 1987, it contributed less than
one-half of one percent of Xerox revenue, he added.
   He said the move resulted mainly from pressure brought by
many U.S. city governments, which have refused to deal with
companies that have ties with South Africa.
