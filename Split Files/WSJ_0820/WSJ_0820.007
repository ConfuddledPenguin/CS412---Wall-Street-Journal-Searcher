   AMR Eagle, the regional airline division of AMR Corp., has
nearly completed negotiations on an aircraft order that could
total as much as $800 million, according to people in the
airline industry.
   AMR Eagle is negotiating with ATR, an aircraft
manufacturing consortium jointly owned by Aeritalia of Italy
and Aerospatiale of France, for as many as 100 planes, the
industry people said.

   A spokesman for AMR Eagle confirmed that the company plans
to announce "a major aircraft purchase" on Wednesday but
declined to elaborate. Alain Brodin, president of ATR
Marketing, the U.S. division of ATR, confirmed that the
consortium is negotiating with AMR but declined to discuss
specifics.
   AMR Eagle, made up of five company-owned regional carriers
and one franchisee, appears to be on a buying binge, fueled
in part by an aggressive growth plan that mirrors that of its
larger sister carrier, American Airlines. AMR Eagle flies to
about 150 cities, typically smaller ones that aren't served
by American Airlines. Less than two weeks ago, AMR Eagle
announced a purchase of as many as 50 Jetstream Super 31s
made by British Aerospace PLC. The carrier also has 50
options on the Jetstream 40.
   ATR makes two turboprop commuter planes, the 48-seat
ATR-42 and the 66-seat ATR-72. AMR Eagle has both of these
models in its 211-plane fleet. The smaller plane is priced at
$9.9 million, the larger one at $11.9 million. As the largest
U.S. airline and one of the biggest purchasers of planes,
however, AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is typically able
to negotiate hefty discounts when it buys aircraft.
   It wasn't clear, though, how AMR Eagle might split its
latest transaction between the two types of planes, or how
many it will order and how many might be optioned. Typically,
AMR options far more planes than it orders, then converts the
options into firm orders closer to the delivery date when it
can determine its needs better. This arrangement guarantees
AMR a discount because of the size of the potential purchase,
with the added advantage of the company's not having to pay
for all the planes at once. It also guarantees the airline a
favorable delivery schedule.
