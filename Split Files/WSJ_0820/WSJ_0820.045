   After nearly a decade of stagnating sales, domestic
beer-maker shipments rose 1.8% in the first half to 95.5
million barrels from 93.7 million a year earlier.
   In the past 12 months, beer shipments rose more than 1.5%,
according to figures released by the Beer Institute, an
industry information and lobbying group.

   The increases in consumption may have been even greater,
said Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights,
because the shipments don't reflect a decline in
Anheuser-Busch Cos.' wholesaler inventories. In addition,
Adolph Coors Co. had to limit production of some of its
packages because of capacity constraints.
   After years of seeing a large chunk of the consuming
public shift allegiance to wine and other drinks with more
cachet and fewer calories, the first-half spurt came as a
welcome relief. At least one industry analyst thinks the
turnaround may be related to changing perceptions of beer.
   "People are getting smarter and drinking more beer," said
Mr. Steinman. "With all this talk of moderation, people
recognize that when you consume beer, you consume alcohol
more slowly, so it's the drink of moderation."
   Most analysts, however, attribute the growth to better
marketing and the increasing variety of beers produced by the
major brewers.
   "There's more excitement today in the beer industry," said
Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing Inc., a New
York consulting firm. "The brewers are doing more
sophisticated market segmentation with interesting new
products in drafts and drys. And the consumer is trying
them."
   Mr. Bellas said that new beers -- such as Coors's
Keystone, Miller Genuine Draft, Busch Draft Light and Bud Dry
-- led the growth in the second quarter, along with the three
top-selling light beers, Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud
Light. "The industry is broadening its consumer base," he
said.
   But analysts cautioned that it's too early to tell whether
consumers' fascination with these new brands will continue.
The shipment numbers may be swollen by consumers' curiosity
over new brands, said Emanuel Goldman, analyst at PaineWebber
Inc. "You won't know where we are until the end of the year."
   The growth spurt "doesn't compare with the roaring years
of wine coolers or the growth rates for wine in the 1970s,"
Mr. Goldman said. In the mid-70s, wine consumption grew 5% to
10% each year.
   The first-half numbers also indicated that the rich are
getting richer in the beer business, while the poor are
getting poorer. The three biggest brewers, Anheuser-Busch,
Adolph Coors and Philip Morris Cos.' Miller Brewing Co.,
shipped 3.6 million more barrels in the first half than a
year earlier, sopping up about 1.9 million barrels in sales
lost by declining brewers, such as G. Heileman Brewing Co.
and Stroh Brewery Co., according to Mr. Steinman's estimates.
