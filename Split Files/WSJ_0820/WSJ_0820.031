   You have tried bar charts, moving averages, break outs,
momentum techniques and studying the rate of growth of
earnings. Still you lose money in the market.
   Maybe your quest for stock-market success is over.
"Financial Astrology for the 1990s" (Llewellyn Publications,
349 pages, $12.95), edited by Joan McEvers, has all the
celestial keys you will ever need to unlock the door to
financial heaven. Among other things, it will help you
navigate through the tricky waters of a company buy-out.
Because it is so difficult to paraphrase this material, I
will simply quote it. The subject is the R.J. Reynolds
buy-out:

   "On October 20, 1988, RJR management announced a private
company buy-out as transiting Mercury turned direct at 11
degrees Libra conjunct natal Uranus in the 4th House and as
transiting Mars was stationing direct at 29 degrees of Pisces
in the 10th House square the 1st/7th House axis,
representative of stockholders and competition. Transiting
Saturn and Uranus had conjuncted for the last time on the 7th
House of competition on October 18, 1988, and were now
quickly heading to early degrees of Capricorn conjuncting the
7th House of competitors -- indicating a sudden change in
trade volume]" If only Shearson had gazed heavenward]

   Burton Malkiel has done it again. The fifth edition of his
book "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" (Norton, 440 pages,
$22.95) manages to scuttle some old verities and produce some
new truths. But neither of these are likely to make many
people in the securities business happy (or wealthy).
   Much of what Mr. Malkiel writes is derived from the notion
that the future price of stocks is not predictable based on
past price action nor fundamental information about a
company's projected earnings. He also levels the market
timers by offering evidence showing that, on balance, such
folks have been incorrect in allocation of assets into cash
in essentially every market cycle during the '70s and '80s.
   Mr. Malkiel believes that most investors would be better
off sticking with a variant of the strategy he proposed in
the first edition of his book: Put your money in a mutual
fund that matches a broadly diversified stock index. He
justifies this by citing various studies that would
dishearten those who make their living trying to pick
well-performing stocks.
   In the 15-year period to 1989, more than two thirds of the
professionals who manage pension-fund common stock portfolios
were outperformed by the unmanaged S&amp;P 500 stock index. He
also notes that while each year some mutual funds always
manage to beat the stock index averages, there is no
consistency to their performance. A manager who has a better
than average performance one year has only a 50% chance of
doing better than average the next.
   So Mr. Malkiel reasons that its costly to pay managers to
try to pick winning stocks for you when the evidence he has
amassed shows clearly that most of them can't. That is why he
suggests buying low-cost index mutual funds that match the
S&amp;P 500 stock index and the Wilshire 5,000 stock index. He
added the latter index in this edition because other studies
show small companies typically grow faster than larger ones.
The Wilshire index includes many smaller companies. Of
course, such a fund is slightly riskier than one that just
invests in the S&amp;P 500 stocks.
   For those who believe that they can beat the performance
of an index mutual fund Mr. Malkiel offers some advice that
also is not likely to bring cheers from anyone laboring on
Wall Street. For example, he suggests that those who trade
the least are likely to do best.
   Another useful bit of information provided is the
"life-cycle investing program," in which he outlines how
investors should change their investment strategies as they
age. In this section he makes a very telling point showing
that the risk of most investments go down the longer you own
them.
   Will Mr. Malkiel's book make you rich overnight? Not
likely. But it will provide any investor or potential
investor with all the tools he or she needs to earn at least
average returns. Considering how few professional money
managers can meet that standard it seems like a worthy goal.

   Maybe you are not quite ready to follow even Mr. Malkiel's
simple strategies -- you just want to make sense out of the
price tables in the third section of this newspaper. Gerald
Warfield's book "The Investor's Guide to Stock Quotations"
(Harper &amp; Row, 245 pages, $10.95) could be just what you need
to get started. After all, if you can't interpret the prices
how can you know if you are winning or losing?
   Even experienced investors might learn some things about
reading the price quotes from this book. For example, I would
bet that not many traders know that the fifth letter in the
symbol of an over-the-counter stock carries special meaning.
A "Q" means the company is in bankruptcy; an "E" means the
National Association of Securities Dealers has found the
company to be delinquent in filing documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Knowing little things
like that could be worth a lot.
