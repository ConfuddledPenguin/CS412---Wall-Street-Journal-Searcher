   Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France;
Messerschmitt-BoelkowBlohm G.m.b.H., a unit of Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany; British Aerospace PLC; and Construcciones
Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
   As reported earlier, Airbus sales in the first half of
1990 dropped to 118 from 252 in the year-earlier half, caused
in part by a four-month strike at British Aerospace, which
makes wings for the planes.
