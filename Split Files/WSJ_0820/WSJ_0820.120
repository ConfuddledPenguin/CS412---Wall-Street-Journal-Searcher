   NEW YORK -- Interest rates are expected to continue
climbing around the world and that could spell more trouble
for the U.S. bond market.
   U.S. rates already have surged -- pummeling bond prices --
on fears that the recent oil price surge will fuel broader
inflation. But rates are going up in other major industrial
countries, too.

   And now, just when the sagging U.S. economy might is
pressuring the U.S. Federal Reserve to reduce short-term
interest rates, central banks in other parts of the world
appear ready to push rates higher. When that happens,
analysts say, long-term U.S. bonds are sure to suffer the
repercussions.
   "We're not saying that U.S. bond rates will increase
dramatically," says Anita Lauria, an international analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc. "But higher rates abroad at the very
least will put a floor under the U.S. market and prevent
{long-term} rates from falling" even if the Fed eases here.
   Economists expect central banks in Japan and West Germany,
both of which faced rising inflation even before the oil
price jump, to boost interest rates in coming months. A move
by West Germany's Bundesbank could inspire similar moves by
France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and other countries.
   The U.S. competes in a global market for capital and so
can't afford to ignore rates in other countries. In fact,
many economists argue that interest rates around the world
are linked and that a surge in one country spills over into
the next country.
   That's exactly what happened earlier this year when talk
of German unification first materialized. World bond markets
were clobbered in the worst decline since the early 1980s,
and interest rates surged as investors worried that combining
East and West Germany would lead to soaring economic growth
and, in turn, blowout inflation. Now the international
markets are facing another round of global rate increases.
   "It is likely that we will see rate increases in Japan as
soon as the equity market stabilizes -- maybe by September,"
said David Boardman, executive vice president at Rowe Price
Fleming International Inc., London. "West Germany will also
raise rates, but they may hold off" until later in the year.
   Both Japan and West Germany are raising rates in an effort
to curb inflationary pressures brought about by strong
economic growth. Japan's gross national product is growing at
an annual rate in excess of 6% and its labor markets are
extremely tight. Although Japan's inflation rate is just over
2%, the nation is considered more vulnerable than other
countries to the inflationary impact of rising oil prices.
   The Bank of Japan, which has been far more aggressive in
fighting inflation than the Federal Reserve, has warned
several times that it will eventually raise the official
discount rate from its current 5.25% level. Analysts at
Salomon Brothers believe the rate could rise between 3/4 and
one full percentage point.
   West Germany, which has an inflation rate of about 3.3%,
is expected to raise its discount rate one full percentage
point later this year from a current level of 6%. Although
inflation is a major impetus for the Bundesbank to raise
rates, bond yields are expected to rise significantly in
advance of any rate increase, because of heavy issuance of
new debt.
   West Germany is under pressure to raise large sums of cash
quickly to stave off collapse of the East Germany economy. To
cover reunification expenses for the balance of this year,
West German officials indicated they need an additional 12
billion marks ($7.73 billion), much of which is expected to
be borrowed in the bond market.
   Meanwhile, the Bank of England said Thursday that it plans
to keep policy tight to bring down its stubbornly high 10%
inflation rate. The United Kingdom is a net exporter of oil
and therefore has been cushioned more than other countries
from the impact of higher oil prices. But wages in that
nation are surging. Last month, the average earnings growth
rate rose to 10% and pay levels are expected to jump even
higher this fall when wage settlements take effect.
   As bleak as the international rate outlook may appear,
some money managers argue that these are good times to
consider investing in foreign bonds.
   Not only are coupon rates in many countries higher than
rates in the U.S., but the U.S. dollar is expected to
depreciate further on foreign exchange markets if the Federal
Reserve reduces short-term interest rates while foreign
governments are raising rates. And when the value of the
dollar falls against, say, the British pound, then securities
denominated in pounds appreciate relative to securities
denominated in dollars.
   The rules for international investing have changed, some
investors say. In the mid-1980s there were more reasons to
invest in the U.S. than in Europe. "You had higher interest
rates in the U.S. than abroad, and when bond markets rallied,
the U.S. rallied most," says Nicholas P. Sargen, director of
international bond research at Salomon Brothers.
   Today, however, he says, "the difference is that around
the world, U.S. interest rates are below those in most
countries, and only fractionally above those in Japan. So
around the world, you can get yield enhancement to go
overseas."
   For example, yields on 10-year government bonds are about
8.75% in the U.S. compared with 12% in Britain, 10.5% in
Canada, 10% in France, 13.5% in Australia, 14.5% in Spain and
15% in New Zealand.
   Some money managers are aggressively investing in the
high-yielding countries. But to avoid potential price
declines that can occur as rates rise, these money managers
are buying short-term rather than long-term securities.
   Klaus J. Buescher, a portfolio manager at Van Eck
Associates Corp., said the value of the world bond fund he
manages has risen consistently in recent weeks even though
prices of world bonds have tumbled. He said the fund, which
is heavily weighted with short-term Spanish and New Zealand
securities, has an average maturity of 3.5 years.
   "We were not caught in the downturn," he said. "Whatever
suffering we experienced due to price erosion was more than
offset by the strength of foreign currencies."
   Meanwhile, at a time when the Federal Reserve is expected
to ease monetary policy, money managers who guide
international bond funds are reducing their exposure to the
U.S. bond market for two reasons. They believe that a move by
the Fed will make coupons on short-term securities
unattractive. Meanwhile, long-term securities may continue to
suffer from inflation expectations and a softer dollar.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   After four days of volatile and hectic trading, the bond
market ended the week on a quiet note with prices posting
modest changes.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended just slightly
lower at a price of 98, down from 98 2/32 on Thursday. The
issue's yield edged higher to 8.93% from 8.92%.
   Four-year Treasury notes were about 1/8 point higher at
100 15/32 to yield 8.33% compared with 100 11/32 to yield
8.46% on Thursday. Two-year notes ended unchanged at 99 26/32
to yield 8.08%.
   The lack of erratic trading was in marked contrast to the
rollercoaster ride that has been the hallmark of trading for
most of the week.
   "The market sort of went to sleep," says Robert Brusca,
economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. The
economist said that Friday's report on merchandise trade
contained enough of both bullish and bearish information to
keep prices from rocking.
   In the corporate bond market, junk bonds registered more
losses as declining equity prices dragged the high-yield
market sharply lower.
   But top-quality corporate bonds fared much better and
ended the day unchanged.
   Among the junk bonds that lost ground were widely held
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. RJR's 17 3/8%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures fell 1 point to 111 1/ 2
on the New York Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities.
   Also hurt were junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and USG Corp.
   Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001 fell
1 point to end at 55 1/2 while USG's 13.25% senior
subordinated debentures due in 2000 also shed 1 point to
close at 55.
   "People are selling things that they think are going to
get crushed in a recession," said one high-yield trader.
   The junk bonds of AmBase Corp. slipped further on Friday
after plunging more than 13 points Thursday. The bonds had
been deteriorating on fears that the sale of the company's
Home Insurance Co. unit may be blocked by regulators or
disgruntled shareholders.
   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes finished down
1/4 point at 81 1/2.
   Some junk bonds of Resorts International Inc. managed to
post a small gain on news that the U.S. bankruptcy court in
Camden, N.J., and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
separately approved the company's reorganization plan. The
beleaguered casino and hotel operator had been operating
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since
December 1989.
   Resort International's 11 3/8% subordinated debentures,
due in 2013, finished up 1 point at 17.
