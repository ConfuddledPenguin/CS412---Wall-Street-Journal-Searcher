   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it will extend the
shutdown of its Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant through this
week.
   The auto maker said the move was "necessitated by a parts
shortage." Ford idled the plant last week because of weak
demand for the Ford Mustang cars built there.

<TEXT>
   The extra week of no production will result in 3,700 fewer
Mustangs for the company and affect about 2,100 hourly
workers.
