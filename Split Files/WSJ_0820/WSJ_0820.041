   WASHINGTON -- Suppose Jesse Jackson gave a news conference
and nobody came?
   It almost happened last week. Last Monday, the magnetic
civil rights leader and Democratic presidential hopeful set a
briefing at the Resolution Trust Corp. on how the savings and
loan bailout agency should do more for minorities.

   One lonely reporter showed up.
   It's not that the Jackson press availability was inside
information. Staffers of his Rainbow Coalition manned the
phones in the morning to call reporters about the 4:15 p.m.
news conference, and a notice was sent out on the news wires.
   That afternoon, this Wall Street Journal reporter walked
over to the RTC headquarters and milled around the lobby --
alone, but for a few Jackson aides. With the news conference
about 15 minutes overdue, one Jackson aide asked what
newspaper the sole reporter was from. She scurried off to
tell Mr. Jackson, then returned to say he would appear
shortly.
   After another 15 minutes, Mr. Jackson emerged, looking a
tad disappointed at the one-man crowd. Even his affinity for
alliteration seemed a bit off: He said he sought the "Three
A's" from the RTC: "access, a positive attitude and
acquisitions." But it was more like two A's and a P.
   Minority contractors and investors, he said in response to
questions from the assembled press, weren't getting enough of
the "fallout of the bailout." Those who were "locked out of
the loans have also been locked out of the bailout." After
three minutes, he rushed off to his car.
   Mr. Jackson's aides blamed the poor turnout on competing
news events: Washington Mayor Marion Barry, fresh from a
cocaine-possession conviction and a hung jury on other
drug-related charges, was changing his party affiliation so
he could run for a city council seat. And even the S&amp;L
scandal paled next to the Iraqi crisis. Or maybe it was just
the heat and humidity of a Washington August that kept
reporters from making the trip. (The news conference was held
just two blocks from the Journal's office here.)
   The afternoon wasn't a total waste for Mr. Jackson,
however. He also met with William Seidman, the RTC's head,
who says the meeting was "very productive."
   Mr. Jackson seems to have regained his drawing power. A
breakfast for reporters later last week -- with discussion
not limited to S&amp;Ls -- drew an overflow crowd.
