   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
considering downgrading its ratings on $6.9 billion in Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. debt because of the company's "ongoing
difficulty" improving its retailing returns. Moody's also
cited its concern about the company's future performance.
   Sears has seen its debt ratings decline in the past year
and a half as both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. have
raised questions about whether it can turn around its $31
billion-a-year retail business. In Chicago, a spokesman for
the retailing and financial services concern declined to
comment.

   Any downgrade wouldn't add much, if any, to Sears's
borrowing costs because its debt ratings remain high and
Sears has vast borrowing power. But the agency's action adds
to the skeptical chorus in the investment community about
Sears's chances for a turnaround.
   Underscoring the point, Richard Mercier, a Moody's
assistant vice president, said "We're concerned that the
merchandise group has not turned around as quickly as
anticipated in early 1989." That's when Moody's last
downgraded Sears securities.
   Moody's said its review will focus on Sears's "ability and
likelihood of reversing the decline in {its} market share,"
the company's options to reduce costs and streamline its
distribution system and "possible restructuring actions."
