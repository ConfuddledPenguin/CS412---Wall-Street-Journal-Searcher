   CROCKETT, Texas -- It is a battle of the sexes that even
Charlie Wilson couldn't have dreamt up.
   For most of two decades, the tall and handsome Texas
Democrat has cut a swath through Congress as a roguish ladies
man and macho militarist. Now the Cold War is over, and, at
age 57, he is under attack from a hazel-eyed West Point
helicopter pilot whose femininity is a weapon against him.

   "I fit beautifully in the front seat," says Donna Peterson
of her old Army gunship. Today she campaigns on country roads
in a 1956 Chevy painted white and robin's-egg blue, her hair
freshly curled, wearing a sailor suit that effects a military
air.
   "Women are very tired of all of our role models having to
look like men," says the Republican challenger, just 30 last
month. With a smile, she needles Mr. Wilson. "I make him very
nervous," she says. "He sweats. Charlie's worried about his
job at this point."
   In suspenders and epaulets, Mr. Wilson fights back from an
air-conditioned, rolling office bigger than an M-1 tank. "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic" plays softly as the soundtrack
in his latest television ad. A second spot will list all the
federal projects he's brought home as a member of the House
Appropriations Committee. He nicknames the ad "Porkbarrel."
   He writes fund-raising appeals under the Appropriations
Committee letterhead as a reminder of his power. With
satisfaction, the Democrat -- who sometimes looks like the
French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo plunked down in a hot Texas
summer -- pauses to count Navy barges coming off the line at
a shipyard owned by a financial backer. "One, two, three,
four, five," he says. "And there's $27 million more in this
year's bill."
   Other House races will be more closely contested this
fall, but few offer a more colorful picture of rural Southern
politics adapting to an international world turned upside
down. When the Berlin Wall fell, Southern Democrats -- like
Republicans -- lost an issue. A pro-military, anti-communist
stance was a staple of Mr. Wilson's past campaigns and a
means of blunting conservative attacks. Like a roughneck
ranger when the outlaws are gone, he must adjust to new
fences.
   Before ready cameras, the Texan once climbed on a white
horse to ride alongside the Afghan guerrillas and wage war
against the Soviet "Evil Empire." But now Ms. Peterson calls
him back to home and hearth. "I Care" is her slogan, and she
casts herself as the champion of East Texas "Christian
values" against an incumbent too taken with worldly events
and worldly pleasures. "When was the last time Charlie Wilson
ever came home except for votes?" she asks supporters in
Liberty County. "He cons us. And then goes back to
Washington."
   Ms. Peterson, though a skilled speaker, is hurt by her
inexperience and lacks the financial support necessary to
make herself known in this sprawling district. Her own
polling claims Mr. Wilson faces a disenchantment among
voters, but Mr. Wilslon's superior finances and political
savvy make Ms. Peterson the decided underdog. Her coyness and
naivete can be off-putting -- but then again, this is Texas,
where the gubernatorial campaign this year pits
multimillionaire Republican rancher and oilman Clayton
Williams against Democrat Ann Richards, the state treasurer.
   Mr. Williams, "The Cowboy" to voters here, has drawn fire
for insensitive remarks about rape and prostitution. In the
latest controversy, one of the top figures in his campaign
has admitted taking two friends on a training exercise --
dubbed "the ultimate hunt" -- using hounds to track down
inmates at a state prison unit.
   Ms. Peterson suggests an alliance to overcome Mr.
Williams's chauvinist image. "If he could help me with my
financial gap," she says, "I would help him with his gender
gap."
   Women should be a source of strength for her own campaign.
Mr. Wilson's escapades are hardly feminist; he once cut money
for the Defense Intelligence Agency after it denied a seat on
a government plane to a Miss World-USA who was a former
girlfriend. But Ms. Peterson has sacrificed ground with women
in building her conservative base. It is Mr. Wilson who
emerges as the abortion-rights candidate, for instance. And
while Ms. Peterson sides with the timber industry, he appeals
to women again by sponsoring pro-environment legislation to
protect 14,000 acres of forest land from lumbering and clear
cutting.
   Mr. Wilson has survived this long by being nobody's fool.
Nearly three-quarters of his campaign funds come from
political committees representing vested interests, and when
East Texas pharmacists press their case against drug
manufacturers, he readily signs up with mock humor. "They
have never contributed a penny to my campaign," he says, "so
I'll help you get 'em."
   What distinguishes him most is this use of power and
showmanship to create a maverick, particularly Texan persona.
His home in Lufkin is decorated with a wall of automatic
weapons set next to rows of toy soldiers. Mr. Wilson, a Naval
Academy graduate, in fact gave up hunting himself after
killing his first squirrel. Behind the bombast is a skinny,
small-town boy who grew up worshiping frontier heroes. If the
Communists are vanquished, he will now stand up for trees.
"Davy Crockett wouldn't be for clear cutting," he says in his
best "Don't burn the flag" voice.
   While still in the Navy, Mr. Wilson worked in John
Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign, and before the year was
out ran for and won a seat in the Texas legislature from his
home town of Trinity. The congressman reached out publicly
for black support in running for his first seat, and the
black vote -- about 11% of the district -- remains an
important part of his base.
   Covering all or part of 16 counties, his district is among
the most Democratic but also most Southern of Texas. Michael
Dukakis won here in 1988 but so did George Wallace two
decades before. Voters betray new resentments toward people
outside of their world, such as Japanese and homosexuals. Ms.
Peterson's campaign -- and more generally the state
Republican Party -- play on this fear of homosexuals, and Mr.
Wilson has to pick his way gingerly through a question over
why he voted only to reprimand his colleague, Rep. Barney
Frank, for ethics violations arising from the Massachusetts
Democrat's relationship with a male prostitute.
   In Lufkin and Orange, there are clear signs of economic
promise after years of trouble, but more-rural areas lag
behind. Laverl Edwards, a farmer in Liberty County, worries
about the impact of the Iraq embargo on his rice sales, and
Mr. Wilson has angered old friends and supporters by his
handling of the timber issue. In rural counties, any
limitation on timber sales detracts from precious revenues
for public schools. "You've got to draw a line," says George
Bass, who is president of Atchley Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. in
Trinity. "And we've drawn the line."
   Many agree with Mr. Wilson's commitment to selective
cutting, which will better preserve East Texas's heritage of
diverse trees apart from pine. But there is a sense, too,
that he has forgotten a bit of that heritage himself and must
come back first to the roots where he began.
   Like many incumbents, his campaign is financed almost
entirely by money from outside his district, and there is a
hurt among some of those who have known him longest. "He's a
pretty sophisticated urban individual now," says Dr. Sam
Barnes, for decades a Wilson family friend -- who nonetheless
remains undecided about supporting the congressman again.
"He's completely ignored us for several years."
