   General Electric Co.'s aerospace division, in its
continuing effort to adjust to defense spending cuts, said it
will consolidate its Re-Entry Systems Department into one
facility. About 100 jobs will be eliminated.
   The department, which provides systems support for space
programs, will be moved from the facility in Philadelphia to
facilities in Valley Forge, Pa. GE Aerospace said that about
800 employees will relocate. In April, it announced the
elimination of 4,200 jobs as part of a major consolidation.
