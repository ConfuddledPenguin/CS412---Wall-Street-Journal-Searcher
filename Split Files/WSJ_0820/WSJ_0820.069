   The plastics industry, seeking to prevent further bans on
plastic packaging, plans to open the nation's largest plant
to recycle the polystyrene widely used for fast-food
containers.
   National Polystyrene Recycling Co., a joint venture of
major plastics makers that owns the plant, says the facility
will start operating in October in Corona, Calif., east of
Los Angeles. It will have a capacity to recycle as much as 13
million pounds of polystyrene a year, including foam plastic
food containers, hard plastic and packing materials.

   James Schneiders, president of the Lincolnshire, Ill.,
joint venture, says he expects the plant to operate at a
profit by 1992, despite doubts among environmentalists that
polystyrene recycling can be economical. The company's
success will depend on whether it can persuade schools,
institutions and fast-food chains to separate polystyrene and
ship it to the plant. Mr. Schneiders says the plant will pay
the market price of four cents a pound, but won't subsidize
transportation costs. So far, about 20 elementary schools and
a university have signed up. "We have just started to
organize our collection programs," Mr. Schneiders says.
   A pilot recycling program has already persuaded the Los
Angeles Unified School District to drop plans to ban foam
plastic food containers.
   Julie Korenstein, a school board member, says the school
district decided 18 months ago to phase out polystyrene
because of environmental concerns. But the cash-strapped
district had hoped for another solution because paper
containers would cost double the $1.9 million a year spent
for polystyrene, she says.
   "The pressure we applied forced the industry to find
better ways of producing and recycling plastic," Ms.
Korenstein says. She says a ban won't be necessary if the new
plant is as successful as a four-month pilot program in which
1.5 million plastic lunch containers from 17 schools were
recycled. The district saved $400 in landfill costs and
earned $1,200 for the plastic, but didn't incur extra
transportation costs. The district hopes to increase its
savings by expanding the program to 200 elementary schools
next year, Ms. Korenstein says.
   The plastics industry joint venture is planning a total of
five recycling plants nationally to prevent the spread of
bans and restrictions adopted in Minneapolis, Newark, N.J.,
and other communities because of the absence of recycling
facilities. A pilot plant in Leominster, Mass., serves more
than 450 McDonald's restaurants and 200 school systems. Three
other commercial plants are scheduled to open in
Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco by the end of this
year. The industry has set a goal of recycling 25% of
fast-food polystyrene by 1995, up from about 1% currently.
   In the Los Angeles area, National Polystyrene Recycling is
contacting fast-food chains, hospitals, Disneyland and other
large producers of plastic waste. The company hopes that
customers will save money through reduced landfill costs and
payments they receive for plastic. But, Mr. Schneiders
concedes, "a lot will depend" on whether customers can get
discounts from their regular trash haulers to offset the
added cost of collecting and transporting plastic to the
recycling plant.
   The plant, which will cost less than $5 million and be
operated by closely held Talco Recycling Inc., will wash the
plastic, grind it up and convert it into "high quality"
pellets. These will be sold for 40 cents or more a pound to
makers of plastic products, such as trash containers, trays,
foam insulation and office products.
