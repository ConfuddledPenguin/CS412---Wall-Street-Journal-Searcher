   THE U.S. AND IRAQ APPEARED to edge closer to armed
confrontation.
   For the first time in the crisis, U.S. warships on
Saturday fired shots, sent as a warning across the bows of
two tankers that refused to stop in the Persian Gulf and Gulf
of Oman. Iraq vowed to hold Western hostages until Bush
withdraws troops from Saudi Arabia and ends economic
sanctions, and said the 3,000 Americans, along with thousands
of other Westerners forcibly detained, would be used as
shields in an attempt to discourage American bombers from
attacking Iraqi military installations.

   East Germany's coalition collapsed when the Social
Democrats bolted in a disagreement over the pace of
unification. The party's departure, while not derailing
unification, solidifies its position as an opposition force.
All major East German parties are committed to unification,
with pan-German elections tentatively set for Dec. 2.
                                                                                                       

   An accord was reached Friday between West German Foreign
Minister Genscher and Soviet counterpart Shevardnadze that
will allow the four World War II Allied powers and the two
Germanys to sign an agreement on Sept. 12 regarding
unification issues.

   Armed Serbs patrolled streets in Yugoslavia's republic of
Croatia to stop police from intervening as the Serb minority

talks with African leaders on ending eight months of civil
