   NEW YORK -- Seeking to assure worried investors, AmBase
Corp. said it will be able to repay its debt upon the
completion of the proposed sale of its Home Insurance Co.
property and casualty insurance business to Vik Brothers
International.
   AmBase, which will be essentially a thrift holding company
when the proposed sale of its insurance units is completed,
made the announcement on Friday in response to "numerous
inquiries about its intention and ability to repay
outstanding indebtedness."

   The company last week said it plans to sell its Home
Insurance subsidiary to the European-based investor group for
$544 million. At the time of the announcement, an AmBase
spokesman said Vik Brothers would also assume $76 million of
AmBase's corporate debt. AmBase said it would also sell
preferred stock in Home Insurance with a face value of $124
million.
   By the time the deal is completed, AmBase's debt is
expected to total about $730 million, consisting of $400
million of senior bank financing, $102 million of 11 3/4%
Sinking Fund Debentures, $150 million of 14 7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes, due in 1998, and the $76 million to be
assumed by Vik Brothers.
   AmBase officials maintain the company will raise enough
cash through the Home Insurance unit and stock sales to pay
off its debt, although some securities analysts remain
uncertain. "People are skeptical," said David Fitton, an
analyst in the high yield research department at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. "This company has not come through in the past."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Friday,
AmBase shares rose 25 cents to close at $2.125. Since the
Home Insurance deal was announced Aug. 14, AmBase shares have
plunged from $7.50.
   After the company announced plans to sell its troubled
Home Insurance units last February, it suspended payment of
its quarterly common stock dividend, but said that it
expected to pay a special dividend to shareholders when it
closed on the sale. Last week, however, AmBase officials
admitted the company would not be able to distribute the
special dividend.
   As a result, a shareholder has filed suit in federal court
in Manhattan, charging AmBase with disseminating false
information to inflate its stock price. The lawsuit claims
that AmBase should have disclosed earlier that it would not
be able to pay the special dividend. The suit, which seeks
class-action status, was filed on behalf of all shareholders
who bought AmBase stock between May 14 and Tuesday. Damages
weren't specified.
   Securities analysts have expressed dismay over the low
price that Home Insurance fetched. "People were expecting
more, because the company led people to believe there was
going to be more," said Udayan Ghose, insurance analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Other analysts said AmBase
shareholders are unlikely to approve the proposed sale.
   Doubts over shareholder approval of the transaction
prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to slightly amend its review
of the debt and preferred securities of AmBase Corp. and Home
Group Funding Corp. Both remain on S&amp;P's CreditWatch list,
which means simply that S&amp;P is anticipating a change in
ratings. Previously, S&amp;P had expected any change in ratings
to be positive, according to a spokeswoman for S&amp;P
CreditWire. Now, the spokeswoman says changes are more likely
to be negative.
