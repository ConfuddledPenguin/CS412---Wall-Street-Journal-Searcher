   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co., Wichita, Kan., said it
instructed its investment bankers to seek alternatives to the
proposed $27-a-share hostile tender offer from neighboring
utility, Kansas City Power &amp; Light Inc.
   KG&amp;E's board earlier recommended that shareholders reject
Kansas City P&amp;L's $857 million offer on the grounds that it
was inadequate and too conditional. A spokesman for KG&amp;E said
alternatives include the possible sale of the company, but he
declined to disclose what companies, if any, are involved in
talks. Any discussion of that information "might jeopardize
the continuation of discussions," KG&amp;E said. In Kansas City,
Mo., a spokeswoman for Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co., said,
"We look forward to negotiating all aspects of our offer with
Kansas Gas &amp; Electric.

   "Our fully financed, all-cash tender offer for the company
is a win-win" situation for the Wichita concern's
shareholders, employees and customers, the spokeswoman
asserted.
