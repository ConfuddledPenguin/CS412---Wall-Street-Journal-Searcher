   BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, said it plans to develop a
digital cellular mobile telephone system in New Zealand by
mid-1992.
   The system will use the group speciale mobile, or GSM,
standard being introduced throughout Europe, the company said
in Wellington. BellSouth has management rights to a radio
frequency band in New Zealand.
