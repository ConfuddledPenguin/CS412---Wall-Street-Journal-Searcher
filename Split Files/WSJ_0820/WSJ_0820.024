   ROME -- Can the left rule Italy?
   Changes in the Italian Communist Party, accelerated by
events in Eastern Europe, are fueling speculation among
Western diplomats and others that Italy's left-leaning
parties will form an alliance that will end the political
stagnation brought on by 40 years of Christian
Democrat-dominated rule -- perhaps as early as 1995.

   A rise of the left hinges in large part on how politically
risky the Italian Socialist Party, which forms part of the
government's five-party ruling coalition, deems a partnership
with the Communists -- and whether the Communists, blocked by
the Christian Democrats from cabinet posts, are willing to be
the junior partner in such an association.
   And, observers say, the electoral system also would have
to be reformed to reduce the number of Italy's many political
parties and make it easier for one party or an alliance to
win a majority and avoid a coalition government. Under the
current "lottizzazione", or spoils system, ministerial posts
and ranking government jobs are divided among the parties of
the ruling coalition.
   Nevertheless, recent events are making the rise of a
united left more possible than ever before.
   At the extraordinary Communist Party congress in Bologna
in March, more than two-thirds of delegates voted to change
the party's name -- its new label will be decided at an
autumn congress. They also voted to drop the hammer and
sickle from the party logo and form a new identity. By moving
to shake off the trappings of communism, the party is taking
a giant leap toward acceptance by the Socialists, who have
said they would block the Communists' application for
membership in the International Socialist and the European
Parliament's Socialist groups -- credentials vital to the
Italian Communist Party's quest for legitimacy.
   In the May regional elections -- the Communists' first
major test after the Bologna congress -- the party vote
dropped to 24% from 30.2% in 1985; that vote was the party's
worst defeat ever. Most of the difference was spread among
other parties. But the Socialists gained only two points from
13.3% in 1985.
   Says a Western diplomat: "The Socialist Party must do more
than gain two points in five years if it wants the prime
ministership and major ministries."
   Adds John L. Harper, professor at Johns Hopkins
University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International
Studies in Bologna: "The Communists and Socialists must now
get down to business, because they're not going anywhere
alone . . . The Socialists recognize that they're stuck . . .
in a political situation . . . with {Prime Minister Giulio}
Andreotti and the most conservative faction of the Christian
Democrat Party."
   Observers also note that the dream of Bettino Craxi,
Socialist Party leader and former prime minister, is to
reunite the left and correct the Italian Communists'
defection in 1921. His long-range strategy is to pull the
Socialists out of the government's ruling coalition and lead
the left in overthrowing the Christian Democrats. The
observers say Mr. Craxi is a passionate man with deeply held
beliefs about his purpose in life. Those beliefs may be
heightened by the 56-year-old's health: Rumors say his
diabetes is worsening.
   Further, the Communist Party's painful, dragged-out
metamorphosis into an acceptable social-democratic party
makes the Socialist strategy less politically risky.
   And although there is still much bad blood between
Socialists and Communists, the tone of the debate between
them has become more conciliatory and insults have stopped.
   The Communist Party also has put people with technical
competence in its shadow cabinet, such as shadow Justice
Minister Stefano Rodota, a professor of civil law at the
University of Rome and a member of parliament since 1979; the
party also is pushing practical legislation, a sign that its
leaders are thinking more clearly about coming into power.
   Finally, some worry that Italy's economic prosperity can't
last; they think the left's chances for power will be boosted
when the economy gets worse.
   But observers are careful to note that Communist Party
Secretary Achille Occhetto's reconstitution of the party is a
gamble -- not only for his political career, but also for the
party's very survival.
   "If you destroy the Communist identity, what are you left
with?," asks Patrick McCarthy, professor at the Johns Hopkins
Bologna Center. "All the Communists who volunteer for nothing
-- are they going to do that for a party they know nothing
about, and that has no history? The hammer and sickle are
emotive."
   The Italian Communist Party was born in 1921 when it split
from the Italian Socialist Party over policy differences. The
Communists were instrumental in drafting a postwar
constitution, which established democracy in Italy. With 1.5
million members, it is the largest such party in the West.
   But even if the Communists and Socialists manage to form a
partnership, their declining vote totals would need the
support of other parties to have a chance to topple the
Christian Democrats. Votes from the small Social-Democrat,
Republican, Radical and Green parties, however, give such a
left coalition optimistically only about 48% -- not the
majority plus a few percentage points needed to gain control
in the Council of Ministers, or cabinet. Some votes surely
would come from Roman Catholics and others who want change
but have been afraid to vote the Communist ballot. But
political experts caution not to exaggerate their number.
   Observers also note that the whole "socialist-unity"
strategy will fail without electoral reform. Since the end of
World War II, vote splits among the Socialists, Communists
and others have allowed the Christian Democrats to dominate
in coalition governments. "Prime Minister Andreotti's
strategy has been to keep the left divided -- to keep the
Socialists and Communists apart," says Prof. Harper.
   A movement is afoot, however, to remove Italy's
proportionality system through a referendum. Those seeking
change want an electoral system modeled in part after West
Germany's, in which parties winning less than 5% of the vote
can't be represented in parliament. An alternative would be
to force the top two vote-getting parties into a runoff.
Either move would reduce the electorate's choice and move
Italy toward a two-party system.
