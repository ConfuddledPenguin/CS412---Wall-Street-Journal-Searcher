   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and other major trading nations are
still seeking negotiated solutions of international trade
problems involving aircraft builders, commercial shipyards
and auto manufacturers.
   The European Community is in the center of all these
negotiations.

   U.S. and EC officials say they are making progress in
negotiations on scaling down the billions of dollars in
subsidies that West Germany, France, Britain and Spain have
provided to Airbus Industrie, the Western European civil
aircraft manufacturing consortium that competes with U.S.
companies in the world market for jet airliners.
   But U.S. trade-policy officials say they haven't ruled out
the idea of asking for the appointment of a special
international panel, under the rules of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, to investigate the Airbus Industrie
subsidies, if it appears the EC and the U.S. can't resolve
this trade dispute through bilateral negotiations by late
next month.
   Some headway also is being made in other negotiations,
under way for more than a year within the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, on a
proposed agreement to reduce government subsidies to
commercial shipbuilders in Western Europe and Japan.
   The U.S. has been pressing for such an agreement, in
response to complaints from members of Congress and U.S.
shipyards that domestic shipbuilders can't compete for orders
against heavily subsidized shipyards in Western Europe, Japan
and South Korea.
   An international agreement to limit such subsidies may be
reached by late this year, U.S. officials say.
   The problems relating to trade in passenger autos,
particularly Japan's future exports of cars to Western
European countries, are less immediate.
   However, talks already are under way between the EC and
Japan about so-called "voluntary" restrictions on shipments
of cars made by Japanese companies to the Common Market for
five years, starting in early 1993, according to EC officials
in Washington.
   Such quota arrangements will be needed, they say, if the
EC is to persuade France, Italy and other EC countries that
they should abandon by late 1992 their own "national" quotas
on imports of Japanese cars that have been in effect for a
long while.
   Currently, the U.S. is a only an "interested bystander" to
the exploratory talks between the EC and Japan about auto
trade restrictions. This situation could change if EC
Commissioner Frans Andriessen and other Common Market
officials conclude that the EC-Japanese trade accord should
also cover cars exported by Japanese auto makers from their
U.S. assembly plants. This now seems likely.
   U.S. Trade Representive Carla Hills says any such
restriction on U.S. car exports would be unacceptable.
