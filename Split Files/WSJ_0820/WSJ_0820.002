   RAS AL KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia -- This sun-bleached desert
town, population 35,000, sits on what has become the most
strategically important piece of real estate in the world.
   It is the gateway to the coastal highway that runs from
Iraq to many Saudi oil fields. Just six miles to the north is
the border with Kuwait. According to Saudi officials, the
Iraqi military buildup now totals 170,000 men in the occupied
emirate and continues to grow daily. Any defense against an
invasion of Saudi Arabia must begin here.

   "We are not looking for a war, but if they start, we are
ready for one," said Prince Khalid Al Otaishan, the emir, or
governor, of this coastal province.
   Outside his office, there is a room full of turbaned men,
some of whom balance assault rifles on their knees. In a
field behind the building, several armored vehicles are
parked in a rare spot of shade.
   Other than that, however, there is little to indicate a
military crisis, because both the Iraqis and the American and
allied forces arrayed against them appear to be trying to
play down the growth in their forces.
   U.S. troops, which have continued to pour into Saudi bases
further south, are taking care not to be obvious about their
presence. During a long drive up the coastal road, reporters
saw only a few jeeps, two light tanks, some helicopters, and
two busloads of troops to indicate that Marines and
paratroopers are patrolling the oilfields.
   According to Saudi officials, who asked not to be
identified, the Iraqis appear to be following a similar
policy. Their main forces are at least 25 miles from the
Kuwaiti border, holding what appears to be a defensive
position in a broad crescent-shaped formation around the city
of Kuwait. And they have established a major command post
south of the city.
   "There is a lot of tension in the air," said Albert Skiba,
an employee of a U.S. oil-service company, as he finished
lunch at a beachfront hotel here.
   The hotel is full and the town is beginning to fill up
again, according to the prince. Some of the city's residents
fled after Iraq invaded Kuwait, but now, bolstered by the
presence of Saudi troops and the knowledge that American
troops and warships are nearby, they are returning, he said.
   Some Kuwaitis, including Capt. Mohammed Al Ajmi of the
Kuwait air force have come to the border area after initially
fleeing farther south with his family. He said that's because
he can use his car phone to call relatives in Kuwait, where
he says there is growing guerrilla resistance to the Iraqi
occupiers.
   Saudi officals say they have heard of two cases in which
Kuwaitis have bribed Iraqi crews to abandon their tanks and
then blew them up. Capt. Al Ajmi says he has heard of a case
where Kuwaitis used a car bomb to blow up an Iraqi command
post in Kuwait.
   One worry that Saudi officials here have is that the lull
that has settled over this town could end quickly.
   Moreover, one official noted, there are an additional
85,000 Iraqi troops just north of Kuwait in Iraq. Thousands
more are believed to be moving south from Iraq's border with
Iran -- a result of Iraq's peacemaking overtures to its
former enemy.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, touring the Middle East,
told U.S. troops that the Pentagon's latest estimates are
that Saddam Hussein's army has moved "over 200,000 men" into
Kuwait and southern Iraq, along with "well over 1,000 tanks."
   At the same time, a senior Pentagon official traveling
with Mr. Cheney indicated that the U.S. buildup would
continue until at least 60,000 fighting troops and another
40,000 or so supporting soldiers have arrived in the region.
"We will stop only when the president says enough, and
there's no sign of that yet," the official said.
   Moreover, Mr. Cheney is expected to lay the groundwork for
potential sales of military equipment to Oman and the United
Arab Emirates when he meets with leaders of those countries
today. And a senior Bahrain official said that the Persian
Gulf kingdom would be willing to make bases available to the
U.S. if it became necessary to counter Iraqi threats.
   Prince Al Otaishan, 41, who has a master's degree from the
University of Southern California, says he is glad to have
the U.S. assistance. However, he says, he has announced
contingency plans to evacuate residents to a tent city in the
desert should shooting start.
   "You have to protect people. You just can't leave them
here." he said.
   Mursi Abubakr, son of the owner of the beachfront hotel,
said he hasn't heard of any official evacuation plans and
can't conceive of leaving. "You just can't leave this," he
said, referring to the business.
   "We called the {U.S.} embassy," said Scott Scheid, another
oil-field service company employee, "and they said they would
call if there is a problem."
   One problem would be if the production here from the
Japanese-owned Arabian Oil Co., whose fields produce 300,000
barrels of oil a day, were lost to the West.
   In a briefing given to U.S. reporters over the weekend,
Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said the combined
production loss from Kuwait and Iraq would amount to "well
over" four million barrels a day. The Saudi government, he
said, isn't sure how much of that could be made up by other
sources because it doesn't know the actual production
capacity of some of the other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Departing from the usual diplomatic rhetoric used by the
Saudis, he said his government was demanding that OPEC meet
"immediately" to plan how to help resolve the crisis.
Otherwise, he said, Saudi Arabia will begin to pump an extra
two million barrels a day by itself.
   "We don't see how an organization can turn away its face
and say there is no crisis. All they have to do is go to
Kuwait and they will find one," he said. Indonesia and
several other members of OPEC have indicated that they are
not yet ready for such a meeting.
   Saudi officials say that it may take a while for the pinch
of the international embargo to be felt by Iraq's military.
"They are extremely well-stocked with spare parts and
munitions," one said.
