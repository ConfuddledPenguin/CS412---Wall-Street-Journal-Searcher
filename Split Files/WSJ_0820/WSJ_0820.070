   NEW YORK -- Al Sharpton strides out from under the awning
of an apartment building, ready to give a press conference on
behalf of the black cause in New York. But not all the blacks
present on Harlem's 111th Street are eager to hear Mr.
Sharpton's words. A cameraman from a local TV station hides
for a moment with his $60,000 camera behind his mini-van.
Just moments earlier, one of Mr. Sharpton's companions had
whacked the man's camera-stand with a baseball bat.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton loves black America, but black
America isn't sure it loves him back. To the mounting dismay
of many blacks, the rotund reverend has made a name for
himself in the past five years supporting black defendants in
what have come to be called bias cases. Yesterday he was here
to announce that he and his supporters will fund the appeal
of Antron McCray, one of three black youths convicted this
weekend of raping and beating a white woman they attacked as
she jogged one evening in Central Park. Mr. Sharpton leans
forward, his shoulder-length locks flapping, to explain why
this trial, like similar trials in this state over the past
few years, has proven the U.S. justice system works against
blacks.

   "This is absolutely incredible," he says of the jogger
verdict. "It is racist." A large brass pendant etched with a
picture of Martin Luther King slides across his chest. As far
as many of the black spectators are concerned, though, Mr.
Sharpton doesn't stand for the King dream. "I'm outta here,"
frowns the cameraman and ducks into his truck.
   "Violence is on the horizon now," says Mr. Sharpton in a
quiet moment a few hours later at a downtown office. He says
black support for his cause is growing. "Right now I am
drawing 100 people, 200 people to rallies every week,"
"There's nobody else in this town who can draw a rally like
that." If New York Governor Mario Cuomo enjoyed the kind of
popularity he enjoyed, he says, "he would announce he was
running for president."
   Al Sharpton was born in 1954, the same year as Brown v.
Board of Education, the Supreme Court's landmark decision
against segregation. Since his youth he has nevertheless
campaigned on blacks' behalf as if injustice were as great as
in the days of slavery. His work began at the age of four,
when "the wonder boy preacher" gave his first sermon at the
Washington Temple of God in Christ, New York's largest
Pentecostal church.
   A disciple of Adam Clayton Powell, Jesse Jackson and
Martin Luther King, he argues that his inflammatory
campaigning today is in the peaceable King's tradition. "I
think Martin would have been in general agreement with me,"
-- he says -- "although he would probably say my style is
more dramatic."
   That style came to national attention when Mr. Sharpton
agitated to prosecute Bernhard Goetz, the subway rider who
shot black youths when they tried to mug him on the New York
subway. He exhibited it again when he led marchers in Howard
Beach in protest of the killing of a black. But he gained
fame -- and infamy -- for his defense with lawyer Alton
Maddox of Tawana Brawley, a black 15-year-old whose claim
that white policemen raped her, covered her with excrement,
and stuffed her in a garbage bag turned out to be a hoax.
   That discovery -- and a 67-count indictment for fraud --
haven't slowed Mr. Sharpton. "I believe Tawana Brawley is
innocent," he says today. (As for the indictment, a jury
recently cleared him of stealing from a charity he founded,
the National Youth Movement.) Sporting his trademark jogging
suits -- he says he owns 20 of them -- he has marched in
Manhattan and Brooklyn to protest what he sees as racism in
the legal system. He brought Ms. Brawley -- clad in an
elegant black coat dress -- to attend the trial of the
jogger's attackers because "I wanted to show the difference
in the system when a white and a black makes an accusation."
When the TV cameras focused on Mr. Sharpton's followers
outside the courthouse during the jogger trial, they chanted
the jogger's name, which most media have not released.
   Now that the jogger trial is ending, Mr. Sharpton says his
goal "is to agitate, to keep the city on edge" until justice
is done. He says he doesn't advocate violence -- and even
argues that the bat-wielder in Harlem would have done "worse
if I hadn't prevented it." But in the eyes of many New
Yorkers, his coy warning that tension is going to build
amounts to the same as a call for violence. A white trader
for the New York Stock Exchange reports the following joke:
"What do you do if you have Saddam Hussein, Moammar Qadhafi
and Al Sharpton, and in your hand is a gun with two bullets?"
Answer: "Shoot Al Sharpton twice -- to be sure he's dead."
   Black New Yorkers may not be so blunt in their
disapproval, but many of them are also angry. Mayor David
Dinkins, who is black, reacted with fury over attempts to
weaken the jogger's case, saying that the jogger "shouldn't
be made a victim a second time" in a farce of a trial. When
the mayor made a public call for racial harmony this spring
after the city grew tense over allegedly racist treatment of
blacks at a Korean grocery in Brooklyn, he attacked the press
for going directly to Mr. Sharpton for a rebuttal. Asked in a
May Daily News/WABC poll to pick the figure or institution
who hurt race relations most in New York, 73% of the black
New Yorkers polled chose Al Sharpton.
   In part, black Americans revolt against figures like Mr.
Sharpton because they feel his picture of growing tension is
a lie. A Roper poll this year found that blacks were far less
unhappy with neighborhood conditions such as unemployment and
crime than they had been in a similar poll in 1978. According
to Burns Roper, the organization's chairman, blacks also feel
discrimination has lessened: Only one-third of blacks now
think whites have a better chance of being hired for jobs,
down from a half in 1978. "It is very clear" that Mr.
Sharpton does not represent black America, says Mr. Burns.
   Alan Keyes, a black former State Department official and
candidate for the Senate in Maryland, associates the Sharpton
phenomenon with a feeling among some blacks that past
injustices pardon current sins. "They think whatever has
happened -- economic injustice -- has turned black people
into an exempt group." He links the jogger trial and other of
Mr. Sharpton's causes to the trial of Washington Mayor Marion
Barry. Despite evidence on video, the jury convicted the
mayor only of a misdemeanor, possession of cocaine. Says Mr.
Keyes: "You can't take a vocal spokesman {such as Mr.
Sharpton} as indicative of anything except maybe success at
attracting attention in the white media."
   Support from white liberals is certainly part of Mr.
Sharpton's success. He is building ties with left-leaning
white groups. Hours after yesterday's rough press conference
on the Harlem street, for example, he could be found in the
genteel offices of the Castillo Center, a SoHo cultural
organization whose supporters include many white citizens of
the bohemian neighborhood. Just a few doors down from where
the reverend and his oversized bodyguard are seated, a
painting of a black woman embracing an image of Vladimir
Ilyich Lenin hangs on the wall. "Black Plus Red Power" read
the words beside the image.
   Now that the defendants in the jogger case have been
convicted, what comes next? Mr. Sharpton wants a reform of
the justice system, and to keep New York "on the edge" until
things change. He says new leaders like him will replace
softer rights campaigners like the venerable National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mayor
Dinkins "is very soft on the rights of his own people," he
says. He adds: "He {Mayor Dinkins} has marched all over the
world for Soviet Jewry, but he says I shouldn't march in
Bensonhurst."
   Some American black thinkers -- even conservative ones --
argue against writing off Mr. Sharpton as a buffoon. "I don't
think anyone represents all of black America," says Shelby
Steele, an English professor at San Jose State University in
California and author of a new book on the subject of race.
But, he adds, "the easiest thing on earth is to see Al
Sharpton as a kind of hustler . . . the press has failed to
look under the surface and see what he does represent" -- an
oppressed black underclass in America.
   Mr. Keyes sees it slightly differently. Blacks in America
may be in despair, he says, but it is a despair that in part
has been caused by the wrong attitude. The problem, he says,
is that all Americans -- white and black -- have seen blacks
as victims for too long. The result is a shortage of
confident black leaders. America turns to its Sharptons, Mr.
Keyes says, "because there's a lack of rebuttal."
