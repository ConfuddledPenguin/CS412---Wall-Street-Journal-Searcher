   New York -- The only problem with a bluff is that someone
may call it. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait he doubtless
assumed that his naked aggression would be met with a great
deal of rhetoric, but little more. The West, after all, is
soft and self-indulgent; America's insatiable need for
immediate oil supplies surely would make a concerted,
sustained effort to go without Iraq's oil out of the
question.
   Something like the same strategy must have been in the
minds of the Actors Equity Council, which voted two weeks ago
to forbid the appearance of British star Jonathan Pryce in
the forthcoming Broadway musical "Miss Saigon."

   The issue, the council argued, was one of discrimination:
Mr. Pryce is white and the role he plays in the London
production is half-French and half-Vietnamese.
   Actors Equity has been very concerned in recent years with
the casting of minorities in theater productions. Admittedly,
there has been a bit of confusion about its various stands.
On the one hand, it insists that roles be performed by an
actor of the race or nationality so designated: black
performers in black roles, Hispanic actors in Hispanic roles,
and so forth.
   But it also has made a big pitch for "color-blind"
casting: black actresses, for example, playing the Swedish
Miss Julie or the Southern Blanche DuBois. Obviously there is
a serious contradiction here.
   You can't encourage the casting of an African-American as
a Caucasian and forbid a Caucasian to play an Asian. But that
is exactly what Equity did, and one reason is that it thought
it could call the bluff of "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron
Mackintosh.
   In point of fact, Equity had no legal basis for refusing
permission for Mr. Pryce to appear. The contract between the
producers and Equity has to do with British-American
exchanges, not with discrimination. Neither country's acting
union will allow an actor from the other country to appear
unless he or she is an acknowledged star. But Mr. Pryce is a
star, having been designated as such by Equity when he
appeared in the U.S. in 1984 in "Comedians."
   There were a number of other ironies in the situation, one
being that Mr. Pryce is a political activist in Britain and a
life-long fighter for the rights of minorities. Then there is
the supreme irony that "Miss Saigon" would employ more than
30 Asian-American actors -- more than have been in any
Broadway show in decades.
   None of this mattered to the members of the Equity
Council, however. They intended to carry through with their
grandstand play on minority casting because they felt they
had Mr. Mackintosh just where they wanted him.
   The advance sale for "Miss Saigon" -- originally scheduled
to open here next March -- was an unprecedented $25 million,
a sum that would corrupt any producer, as Equity saw it,
since, in its view, producers are greedy creatures for whom
the dollar is everything. This, Equity apparently thought,
must be especially true of Mr. Mackintosh, who with "Cats,"
"Les Miserables" and "The Phantom of the Opera" is the most
commercially successful theater producer of modern times.
   It was true, of course, that Mr. Mackintosh had stated he
would cancel the production and return the $25 million if he
could not use Mr. Pryce. But Equity did not believe him. What
difference could one star make, it reasoned, with such a huge
advance? The production would make money no matter what.
   Adding to Equity's confidence in calling Mr. Mackintosh's
bluff was its fallback position. If the ruling went against
him, Mr. Mackintosh doubtless would take the matter to
arbitration, where, many in Equity agreed, he would win his
case. Then Equity would have it both ways: It would have made
its self-righteous point, but the production would still go
on.
   The Equity Council made a few miscalculations, however.
For one thing, Mr. Mackintosh does not need the money: He's
already the richest theater man in the Western world and one
more mega-hit is not at the top of his priorities. Also, he's
a man of principle where theater production is concerned. He
did not become so pre-eminently successful by compromising on
his theatrical values, including the stars in his shows.
   Mr. Mackintosh was interested in only two points: that
Equity should honor its contract, and that he should be
allowed to employ the actor whom he thought was best for the
show.
   In his mind the part of the Eurasian pimp in "Miss
Saigon," who also serves as a narrator, requires a performer
with an exceptional flair, bite and cutting edge. Not only
was there no Asian-American who qualified, there was no
American period. (Having seen Mr. Pryce in the role in
London, one can easily understand Mr. Mackintosh's position.)
   To the consternation of Equity, not only did Mr.
Mackintosh cancel the production -- setting up a mechanism to
return the advance -- but he refused to take the matter to
arbitration.
   Immediately the entire theater world descended on Equity.
This was depriving hundreds of future employment. It was
going to seriously affect the economy of New York and
countless other cities across the U.S. where the production
might go in future years.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins quickly summoned the Equity
leaders to his office at City Hall. Theater writers pointed
out that Equity's vaunted ethical position was riddled with
inconsistencies.(Black performers recently have appeared in
leading white roles in unprecedented numbers.)
   Under the pressure, Equity members in current Broadway
shows petitioned the council to reconsider. Their bluff had
been called not just by Mr. Mackintosh, but by a united
theater community. Last Thursday, in a six-hour meeting, the
Equity Council reversed itself. Equity's executive secretary
stated afterward that the union welcomed Mr. Pryce and wished
Mr. Mackintosh a "long and prosperous run."
   Mr. Mackintosh has said he will respond today or tomorrow.
Every expectation is that he will resume his plans to bring
"Miss Saigon" to Broadway and that Mr. Pryce will agree to
come along.
