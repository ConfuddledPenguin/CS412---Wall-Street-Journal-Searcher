   For some, the war between the sexes is a brief exchange of
sniper fire. For others, it's more like Vietnam -- a long,
messy conflict, with tripwires all around.
   This week, HBO presents three tales of romance. Titled
"Women and Men: Stories of Seduction" (HBO, Aug. 21 at 12:30
p.m. and Aug. 29 at 9 p.m.; check listings for other
airdates), this 90-minute production is a trilogy of
short-story adaptations from the 1920s and 1930s, an era when
the war between the sexes was the only war going. From brief
passion to bittersweet love, "Women and Men" is drawn on
tales by Dorothy Parker, Mary McCarthy and Ernest Hemingway.

   Short-story adaptations of great American writers might
have that artsy PBS stigma for some viewers, but producer
David Brown ("The Sting," "The Verdict," "Driving Miss
Daisy") has put together a big box-office team packed with
more Oscar nominees than Swifty Lazar's waiting room: James
Woods, Melanie Griffith, Elizabeth McGovern and Beau Bridges,
directed by Ken Russell and Tony Richardson, in adaptations
by the likes of Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne. There's
even music by Marvin Hamlisch.
   The trilogy opens with "The Man in the Brooks Brothers
Shirt" (adapted and directed by Frederic Raphael), the story
of an encounter on a train.
   Vicki (Ms. McGovern) is an acerbic leftist journalist,
headed west to tell her father about her upcoming marriage.
Jerry (Beau Bridges) is a somewhat boorish, somewhat wealthy
steel salesman. They have less than nothing in common, except
seats in the same car. But somehow, they end up in a sweaty
one-night stand.
   What makes this adaptation of Mary McCarthy's story so
much fun is the wittiness of the repartee: "For 10 years I've
been feeling like I missed the boat"; "Boats get a long way
in 10 years."
   All along, the tale is moved forward by Vicki's sardonic
voiceover, which is a nice touch. She's bitingly ironic about
Jerry the businessman, yet she finds herself going along with
the seduction, right up to the "Fascist invasion." And
afterward, as Jerry smiles and prattles on about his first
love, Kiki, Vicki fumes about his crowing: "He really thinks
he's won. So he invites Kiki to the victory parade."
   But some of these lines don't work as dialogue. Some trip
up the story's flow with their own wordiness. (As, for
example, when Vicki wakes up with a hangover and spouts in
one breath: "Just what I've always wanted -- a capitalist
S.O.B. who knows how to tip sleeping-car attendants, a man
with no shame no accent no beard and personalized shirts made
by the dozen, a gentleman called Jerry.") And there's a
precious, dated quality to "The Man" that's emotionally
offputting.
   Of course, all three of these tales are period pieces. Ken
Russell's "Dusk Before Fireworks" (adapted by Valerie Curtin
from a Dorothy Parker story) is the most heavily tinged by
its era. Set in the jazz age -- "that era of wonderful
nonsense" -- "Dusk" is a stylized tango of a film. A Don Juan
named Hobie is chased by a possessive conquest, Kit. The
narrator sets the stage: "He was a charmer with a voice as
intimate as the rustle of sheets." "She was one of those
anxious women caught in his web."
   As Hobie, Peter Weller is all slicked-back hair and silk
smoking jacket, but he comes off as strangely stiff and even
slightly menacing. Molly Ringwald sounds -- as she always
does -- like a whiny Long Island brat who needs a good smack.
There's a story here, but between this director and these
actors, it gets lost in the discordant tone.
   Actually, as portraits of relationships, both "The Man"
and "Dusk" are surprisingly lacking in intimacy. But if these
two are emotionally distancing, the third and best film is
stunningly immediate.
   The Hemingway tale, "Hills Like White Elephants" (adapted
by Ms. Didion and Mr. Dunne and directed by Mr. Richardson),
stars James Woods as Robert, an expatriate American writer,
and Melanie Griffith as Hadley, his rich and newly pregnant
American girlfriend.
   Waiting for the train in a small town in Spain, Robert and
Hadley try to come to some decision on what they should do
about Hadley's pregnancy, and what affect it will have on
their relationship.
   Seated at a terminus, they look at the track stretching in
both directions, back into their loving past and out into
their shaky future together. As befits a good Hemingway
story, the dialogue here is clean and uncluttered, and the
performances simple, spare and direct. This is one sweet, sad
film, as heartbreaking as the open road.
   All three of these stories start from the same basic
premise -- one encounter between a woman and a man. All three
mix in the kind of talent rarely seen on TV, talent that is a
joy to watch.
   In the end, however, only one of the three comes off as an
unqualified success. But I prefer to think that "Women and
Men," like a relationship, is about potential -- in this
case, the potential of what television, with a little love
and a little intelligence, could be.
