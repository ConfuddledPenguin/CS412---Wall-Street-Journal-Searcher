   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that
manufacturers in Taiwan have exported sweaters to the U.S. at
prices about 21.4% below "fair value."
   If the U.S. International Trade Commission concludes later
that the imports have injured domestic manufacturers of
man-made fiber sweaters, the government will order extra
duties under the Anti-Dumping Act to offset the price
margins.

   The ITC is expected to issue its final decision in the
next few weeks on whether anti-dumping duties are required on
sweater imports from South Korea and Hong Kong, as well as
from Taiwan.
   According to the ITC, imports of man-made fiber sweaters
from all three Asian suppliers totaled nearly $1 billion last
year.
