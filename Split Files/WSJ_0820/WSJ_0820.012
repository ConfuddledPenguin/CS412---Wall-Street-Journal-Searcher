   Far West Financial Corp. said the Office of Thrift
Supervision rejected its capital plan, and imposed operating
restrictions on the savings and loan holding company.
   Separately, Los Angeles-based Far West said it took an
additional $16.9 million in loss reserves for the second
quarter, resulting in an expected second-quarter loss of $3.7
million, or 47 cents a share. A year ago, the company had net
income of $10.8 million, or $1.38 a share.

   Far West said the six-month loss is expected to total
$29.9 million, or $3.83 a share, compared with profit of
$16.3 million, or $2.09 a share, in 1989.
   The continued financial hemorrhage and the OTS action put
Far West at risk of even harsher sanctions that could include
federal seizure. The Belzberg family of Canada, which
controls the company, could elect to recapitalize Far West
and bring it out of its spiral. Far West foundered after
amassing one of the largest junk-bond portfolios in the
industry.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Far
West fell 25 cents to $1.25.
   The company's principal operating unit, Far West Savings &amp;
Loan Association, failed to meet regulatory capital
requirements, and filed a capital plan that was amended in
May.
   However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s San
Francisco office ruled that a major part of that plan, the
proposed liquidation of the unit holding the company's junk
bonds into Far West Savings, was "impermissible," according
to Far West Financial President Charles Green.
   Far West protested the regional office's opinion as
"incorrect," and appealed the matter to FDIC in Washington.
However, pending resolution by FDIC headquarters, Far West
said that on Aug. 13 it was notified by letter that the OTS
too had rejected the capital plan.
   The OTS action precludes Far West from buying or selling
any assets, or making any new loans or commitments without
prior approval from the San Francisco office of OTS.
   In an interview, Mr. Green said the company's capital plan
was based on the proposed liquidation into the thrift of the
unit that owns all of the company's high-yield, or junk
bonds, valued at $395 million as of June 30.
   "Liquidation of that unit into Far West Savings was
designed to accomplish certain tax strategies and to get away
from a capital deduction," Mr. Green said. "It was always our
understanding that we could do that." However, the local FDIC
office in San Francisco "presented this as an impermissible
acquisition of assets," he said. "We maintain we've always
owned these assets. Therefore, there's no acquisition, and no
change of risk" to the insurance fund.
   Indeed, the executive said, rejecting the liquidation
entails more risk to the insurance fund "because it puts our
capital plan in jeopardy." He said he continues to hope that
FDIC policy makers in Washington will review the matter
favorably.
   Far West calculates its thrift's tangible net worth at
$37.7 million as of June 30. But Far West warned that denial
of the liquidation plan could result in a tangible capital
value on a regulatory basis of negative $23.6 million.
Moreover, if certain accounting and tax issues aren't
resolved in Far West's favor, its value could reach a
negative $75 million, the company said.
   While Far West said it believes its assets and liabilities
are properly valued, it noted regulatory authorities may
require the creation of additional reserves for loans,
investments and other contingent liabilities. Such reserves,
if required, would be reflected in the company's third
quarter operating results.
