   NEW YORK -- William Kaye resigned as head of takeover
stock trading at PaineWebber Group Inc.'s PaineWebber Inc.
unit after the firm moved to reduce his authority and change
his compensation. Those moves came after his group suffered
losses on the failed takeover of United Airlines parent UAL
Corp.
   Mr. Kaye, 37 years old, became one of Wall Street's best
known arbitragers, or takeover stock traders, during six
years in charge of the PaineWebber arbitrage department.
During the mid-1980s heyday of corporate takeovers, he
invested as much as $500 million, earning hefty profits both
for the firm and himself. According to Financial World
magazine, he made $12 million in 1989 alone.

   Although Mr. Kaye and PaineWebber disputed the accuracy of
that exact figure, there seems little doubt that Mr. Kaye
made far more than PaineWebber's own chairman and chief
executive officer, Donald Marron, who made $2.1 million in
the same year.
   Mr. Kaye's compensation was the result of an unusual
payout structure giving his small group of seven
professionals and a few clerks between 20% and 25% of the
profits they generated. His 1989 pay reflected huge profits
on such 1988 takeovers as the acquisition of Sterling Drug
Inc. by Eastman Kodak Co. In other departments at
PaineWebber, employees receive a salary plus bonus, with the
bonus limited by profits for the firm as a whole.
   But the arbitrage department's success came to a crashing
halt in October of 1989, when the collapse of the UAL
takeover inflicted heavy losses on takeover speculators
throughout Wall Street as UAL shares tumbled 59% in price. A
dearth of big takeovers this year has continued to limit
arbitrage profits.
   Although PaineWebber still managed to make money in
arbitrage for all of 1989, the firm has said arbitrage losses
hurt results in the fourth quarter of 1989 and first quarter
of 1990. People on Wall Street said those reports frustrated
Mr. Kaye because the firm had never credited arbitrage
profits for helping results in earlier periods.
   Two weeks ago, PaineWebber shifted the arbitrage
department, which had reported to the firm's general counsel,
into the capital markets group, headed by Charles Milligan
and Margo Alexander. The change reduced Mr. Kaye's authority
to make arbitrage investment decisions.
   Mr. Milligan immediately sought to change the arbitrage
group's compensation from a share-of-profits structure to the
salary-plus-bonus structure that governs all other
departments. One person at PaineWebber said the structure and
past size of the arbitrage group's compensation had sparked
resentment elsewhere in the firm. Within the arbitrage group,
the same person said, some members were also unhappy that Mr.
Kaye was entitled to such a large share of the pay.
   Mr. Kaye wasn't available for comment.
   People at PaineWebber said the firm's executives wanted to
exercise greater control over the risks the firm is taking in
a period when caution prevails throughout the securities
industry. This year, the size of the firm's arbitrage
positions has been slashed by roughly four-fifths from their
1988 peak.
   The same people said Mr. Kaye didn't want to be hemmed in
by new restrictions on his decisions. Nor, they said, did he
relish the prospect of his pay being subject to limits
imposed by the profitability of the rest of the firm.
   Mr. Kaye isn't the first arbitrager to feel the
after-effects of the collapse of UAL and the subsequent
dearth of big deals. Earlier this year, the heads of
arbitrage at Travelers Corp.'s Dillon, Read &amp; Co. unit and
Spear Leeds &amp; Kellogg Securities Inc. left their firms, and
Blackstone Group got out of arbitrage entirely.
   A graduate of Vanderbilt University and University of
Chicago Business School, Mr. Kaye came to PaineWebber in 1978
after a short stint in the mergers department at Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. For now, the department is being led by his two
top aides, Richard Schneider, 34, and Mike Donatelli, 32,
although they haven't been given new titles yet. Neither
would comment.
   In an interview, Mr. Milligan said he believes
opportunities will soon increase for arbitrage profits,
particularly as more participants retreat. With the dollar
weakening and more U.S. companies likely to be acquired by
European concerns, he said, "We think there's going to be
tremendous activity going forward."
