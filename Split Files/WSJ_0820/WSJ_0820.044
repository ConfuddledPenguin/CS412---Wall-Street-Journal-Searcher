   FREMONT, Calif. -- Stephen J. Russo, 34 years old, was
named president and chief executive officer of Koala
Technologies Corp., succeeding Douglas W. Kenny, who is 45.
   Mr. Kenny, according to a company press release,
attributed his resignation to a dispute with the board over
the future direction of the company. Mr. Kenny couldn't be
reached for comment.

   Mr. Russo, formerly chief financial officer of the
plastics and electronics company, said the dispute focused on
future acquisitions strategy. He said the board favored a
focus on Koala's core plastics business, while its former
president favored acquisitions in the field of electronics,
Mr. Russo said.
   The company posted third-quarter net income of $179,200,
or one cent a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of
$137,800, or one cent a share. Sales rose to $2.6 million
from $2.5 million.
