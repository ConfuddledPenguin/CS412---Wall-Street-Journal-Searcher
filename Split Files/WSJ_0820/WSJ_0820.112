   WASHINGTON -- When Iraq sent its tanks cruising into
Kuwait and massed its troops on Saudi Arabia's border, it
cast a giant question mark over much of the world's oil
reserves. The three countries, after all, contain about 45%
of all the earth's oil resources and account for almost 20%
of all present productive capacity. Thus, on the surface,
Saddam Hussein might seem as serious a threat to global
economic health as the Arab oil embargo of 1973 or the
Iranian revolution of 1979, both of which threw the Western
economies for a loop as they sent oil prices soaring.
   But the world is better prepared this time. The
international oil market is more sophisticated and
transparent. It is painfully aware that prices can go down as
well as up. The industrial nations are less dependent on oil
than they were a decade ago, and oil stocks are at historic
highs. Governments are doing a better job of responding to
the crisis. And most importantly, the widespread panic that
made the 1970s crises so devastating is largely absent.

   A few simple figures show how dramatically the Western
economies have reduced their energy reliance since the 1970s.
In the U.S., the amount of energy required to produce $1,000
worth of national output dropped to 0.44 of a ton of oil in
1988 from 0.55 in 1979, according to Cambridge Energy
Research Associates. In Japan, the drop was even more
dramatic, falling to 0.27 in 1988 from 0.35 in 1979. The
shift is partly due to a relative decline in heavy-industry
manufacturing in the industrialized countries, but is also
the result of efforts to conserve fuels.
                                                                                                       

   Moreover, the industrialized economies in the 1980s
succeeded in diversifying their sources of energy and making
their economies more flexible. U.S. industry can save an
estimated hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day
simply by switching boilers to natural gas and other fuels.
"The impact of the current crisis on oil prices and the
global economy is likely to be small in comparison to the oil
shock of 1973-74 and 1979 because most countries have been
able to significantly reduce dependence on oil," says Thomas
J. Berger at the London office of Swiss fund manager Lombard
Odier.
   In addition, the suppliers of oil in the world have become
far more diverse. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has in recent months accounted for barely a third
of the world's oil production, down from more than half in
1974. And Cambridge Energy Associates estimates there is now
as much as 600,000 barrels a day of additional potential
production capacity outside of OPEC, in the U.S., the North
Sea, Mexico and elsewhere.
                                                                                                       

   But perhaps the most striking difference between the
current crisis and those of the 1970s is the absence of
panic. No milieu better dramatized Roosevelt's maxim about
fear: Panic buying, tank topping and widespread hoarding is
what drove oil prices sky high in the 1970s, as people and
companies feared oil at $70 a barrel or more -- or feared
that oil would be unavailable at any price. The doomsayers of
the seventies forgot that as prices went up, new sources of
supply would become economic. Instead of reaching $70 a
barrel, oil peaked at close to $40 a barrel.
                                                                                                       

   In some countries, there also was massive diversification
away from oil to other forms of energy, such as
hydroelectricity and nuclear power. In the U.S., a
complicated system of price controls made the situation
worse, playing havoc with supply and serving to heighten
panic, hoarding and price hysteria.
   This time, a conspicuous confidence in the world's ability
to weather the crisis has kept oil price increases far more
modest, in percentage terms, than the tripling and doubling
of prices that occurred in the 1970s.
   President Bush's decisive action stands in sharp contrast
to Jimmy Carter's dithering in 1979 and to the terror and
paralysis that struck the major industrial economies in the
1973-1974 oil embargo. The swift U.S.-led military response
to Iraq's invasion -- at least for now -- has removed much of
the threat to the world's richest oil fields, which produce
more than seven million barrels of oil a day. Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and possibly the United Arab Emirates are
apparently willing to increase their output to offset much of
the loss of Iraq and Kuwaiti oil. And in contrast to 1979,
the U.S. has appeared to retain the initiative.
                                                                                                       

   "Nobody declared an embargo on the U.S., we declared an
embargo on them," says Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance
Co., a Washington consultancy. "We're hitting, we aren't
being hit. There's a very important psychological
difference."
                                                                                                       

   To be sure, no matter how successful the West is in
preventing panic, the current crisis will exact its costs.
There will be continuing disruption as consumers who bought
Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil struggle to find alternative supplies.
That will be particularly tough for Japan and other Pacific
nations who have relied on Kuwait's refined oil products, and
also for developing nations like Brazil and India that import
a lot of Iraqi crude.
   Moreover, if the current face-off between Presidents Bush
and Hussein continues, the world's reserves may slowly be
drawn down, and oil prices will climb higher. In addition,
the Iraqi crisis looks like it may be just bad enough to
nudge the already-teetering U.S. economy brink into
recession.
   But barring an undeterred Iraqi invasion of the Saudi oil
fields -- which is increasingly unlikely -- the world will
emerge from this crisis far less scarred than it did from
those of the 1970s.
