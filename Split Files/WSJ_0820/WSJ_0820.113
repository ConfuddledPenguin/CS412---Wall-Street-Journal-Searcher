   Dart Drug Stores Inc. said it will liquidate the company
because it has been unable to develop a plan of
reorganization acceptable to creditors.
   The Landover, Md., discount retailer, which owes about
$130 million, said it plans to close all 65 Fantle's
Drugstores in the Washington area by early November.

   Dart Drug filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code about a year ago.
The company said it plans to sell its inventory and store
leases as soon as it has authorization from the bankruptcy
court, but declined to estimate proceeds.
   The company said it owes about $24 million to its major
secured creditor Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh. Trustees
for the largest groups of unsecured bondholders are
Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Co., with debt of about
$101 million, and Signet Trust Co., with about $29 million.
   In April 1989, Dart Drug changed the name of its stores to
Fantle's and tried a new store format in an effort to boost
sales and profits. Sheldon W. Fantle, chairman and chief
executive officer, said strong competition and a sluggish
economy prevented the company from fully implementing its
marketing strategy.
