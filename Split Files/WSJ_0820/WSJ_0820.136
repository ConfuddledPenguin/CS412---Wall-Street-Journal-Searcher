   SEOUL -- The South Korean government rejected the Samsung
Group's application to make commercial vehicles here, fearing
a possible oversupply that would weaken the country's auto
industry.
   The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Samsung's
plan to import technology to make large-sized special
vehicles from Nissan Diesel Motor Co. of Japan would
undermine South Korea's auto industry, which has suffered
from sharp wage increases and shrinking exports in recent
years.

   The ministry, however, promised to re-evaluate the
application by the South Korean business group after October
1991.
   The case has been a hot issue locally because the
ministry's decision amounts to a test of a new government
policy to allow more competition among industries. In 1989,
the government abolished an industry protection law, but
retained the power to restrict imports of technology, such as
that proposed by Samsung.
   Ministry officials added that the current shortage of
large-sized commercial vehicles, such as dump trucks, will be
resolved by next year when the present construction boom
subsides.
   Samsung had sought government permission to make
commercial vehicles in Korea, citing an excessive demand of
those vehicles relative to supply.
   Currently, four companies in Korea make similar vehicles,
but their output meets only about 70% of demand, estimated at
20,000 trucks and 10,000 buses annually.
   Existing local auto makers have strongly opposed Samsung's
plan to assemble vehicles, fearing oversupply. The local auto
makers also presume that Samsung's eventual plan is to enter
the passenger car business, despite the group's repeated
denial of that intention.
