   ST. LOUIS, Mo. -- May Department Stores Co. said its board
authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of May common
stock.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, May
shares closed at $46.625, down 25 cents. At that price, full
exercise of the repurchase authorization would represent the
purchase of about 5.36 million common shares, or about 4% of
May's common and common equivalent shares outstanding.
