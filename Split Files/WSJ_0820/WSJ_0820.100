   HAL Inc., the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, reported that
its second-quarter net loss grew more than fivefold to $26.9
million, or $12.42 a share, because of heavy investments and
soft market conditions.
   In last year's second quarter, the Honolulu-based company
posted a net loss of $4.3 million, or $2.20 a share. The
year-ago loss reflects an $8.4 million gain on the sale of
property and equipment. Revenue slid to $79.6 million from
$84.2 million a year ago.

   HAL said heavy investments in aircraft improved its
on-time performance, and were expected to "slow our
turnaround." But unexpectedly soft market conditions, coupled
with the suspension of its military charters "made this
quarter especially rough," the company added.
   For the six months, HAL's loss more than tripled to $43
million, or $19.89 a share, from $13 million, or $6.68 a
share, in last year's period. The year-ago loss reflects a
gain on sale of property and equipment of $8.4 million.
Revenue declined to $160.7 million from nearly $168 million a
year ago.
