   Net income rose 67% to 9.922 billion ($673 million) yen
from 5.955 billion yen ($404 million). Per-share net rose to
55.25 yen from 35.79 yen.
   Sales rose 31% to 141.672 billion yen ($9.6 billion) from
107.859 billion yen ($7.3 billion). Sales of laser and
compact disk players and their related software were
particularly strong, according to Pioneer.
   The value of sales abroad was also increased by the
weakness of the yen in the first quarter, compared with a
year earlier, the company said. Pioneer marked 82.044 billion
yen of sales overseas, 58% of the total.
   Pioneer didn't release a forecast for full-year results,
but said it expects sales to rise further, aided by
introduction of new products.
