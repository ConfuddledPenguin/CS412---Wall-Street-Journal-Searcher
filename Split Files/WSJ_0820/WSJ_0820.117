   Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia said it completed the sale of

other Elders IXL officials resigned from the board of Elders
Resources, the company said.

   "The conclusion of this sale represents a further
significant step in the company's progress toward its
transformation into a single-purpose international brewer,"
Elders IXL said. The brewing, resources, agribusiness and
financial-services concern is selling assets to focus on
brewing interests in Australia, Canada and Britain.
   Carter Holt, a forestry concern, agreed in June to acquire
Elders Resources for a base price of 623 million Australian
dollars (US$502 million). That price can be adjusted up or
down, depending on prices received for a proposed sale of
mining assets held by Elders Resources.
   Elders IXL was to receive A$414 million (US$333.6 million)
on settlement of the sale, with the balance payable as the
mining assets are sold. The sale represents a loss of about
A$500 million (US$402 million) to Elders IXL on book value.
