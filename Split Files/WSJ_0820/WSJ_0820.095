   Petroleum prices may level out this week in the wake of a
public pledge by Saudi Arabia to increase oil production.
   Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, confirmed over
the weekend that Saudi Arabia intends to expand output as
much as two million barrels a day. At a news conference
Saturday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he said the action
will be taken with or without the approval of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   The increase would make up about half of the four million
barrels a day lost to world oil markets from the latest
Middle East crisis.
   Some other oil exporters with spare capacity -- including
Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates -- are expected to
help fill the gap, Mr. Nazer said. Indeed, in interviews over
the weekend, senior Venezuelan government officials confirmed
their country is ready to increase output soon. Venezuela is
believed capable of pumping an extra 500,000 barrels of oil a
day.
   Saudi Arabia's decision had been expected, but oil markets
have remained jittery because neither the Saudis nor the
Venezuelans had publicly declared their plans. Now, barring
adverse new military developments in the crisis, the formal
statements by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela should help
stabilize prices. Last week, the price of the benchmark U.S.
crude toppped $28, a total increase of about $8 since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   "I wouldn't be surprised to see prices back off a bit
near-term," said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. He added, "The Saudi decision over the
weekend means that Saddam Hussein has lost the oil war."
   Citing the negative impact on developing countries from a
threatened oil shortage, Mr. Nazer had strongly urged Sadek
Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC president, to call
an emergency OPEC meeting to take steps to hold down runaway
petroleum prices. He had noted that the developing countries
would be hurt most by higher oil costs and tight oil
supplies.
   "Developing countries are suffering," Mr. Nazer said.
   According to a copy of a letter to Mr. Boussena obtained
by this newspaper, Saudi Arabia believes that high oil
inventories have helped cushion the impact of the embargo
against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes on richer, industrial
countries. Developing countries have neither the storage nor
financing to keep comfortable inventories. It is understood
Venezuela shares that Saudi view.
   The letter states that continued tight supplies and
escalating prices "will precipitate deep economic recession
in (developing countries) since their degree of dependence on
oil for their energy requirements is far greater than that of
industrialized countries."
   Also, other Persian Gulf sources who support immediate
action suggested that all OPEC members, if they don't do
something to curb escalating oil prices, could see their
markets shrink, just as in the 1970s. "If OPEC doesn't learn
from its past mistakes, it is doomed," one Arab official
said.
   Despite such pleas, Mr. Boussena has resisted calls for a
special OPEC meeting. He has been quoted as worrying that the
controversial issues at stake -- including the contention
over Kuwait's representation -- could "scuttle" OPEC.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, also
has rejected the idea of an immediate OPEC meeting,
reportedly calling the proposal an excuse for other members
of OPEC to increase production at Iraq's expense.
   Several other countries also oppose a meeting at this
time, although some, such as Iran, are said to be increasing
output anyway to take advantage of higher prices and to
expand their market shares while Iraq and Kuwait are
sidelined. Even including the exiled government of Kuwait,
only four other countries fully support the joint request of
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for a special meeting to consider
production levels.
   OPEC's late-July agreement, which set a production ceiling
of 22.5 million barrels a day for the 13 member nations, was
intended to push the group's reference price, based on the
average of a basket of seven crudes, to $21 a barrel. At the
news conference Saturday, Mr. Nazer noted that the price of
the basket is well above $25 a barrel and that production has
dropped to 18.5 million barrels a day. "The shortage of four
million barrels a day can increase if the tension continues,"
Mr. Nazer said, adding: "This should be made up for by all
OPEC members together."
   He predicted, however, that the situation would improve if
the U.S. and other industrialized countries free up their
strategic reserves of crude oil. And he confirmed that if
others in OPEC don't endorse production increases by those
with spare capacity, Saudi Arabia plans to go it alone. But
he emphasized that Saudi Arabia couldn't do it all alone.
   Like Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates could supply an
extra 500,000 barrels a day, said Mr. Nazer. Still, that
"would leave us one million barrels less" than the amount
lost to oil markets so far, he said. He urged that all others
in OPEC with spare capacity join in the effort.
   Mr. Nazer didn't give OPEC much more time. He told the
reporters that if the emergency meeting proposed by the
kingdom fails to get off the ground by today or tomorrow, "it
will be left for each member state to decide alone" on
increases. "What we want to do is go through OPEC," he said,
"but if they refuse to meet, they leave us no alternative."
