   CLEVELAND -- Ferro Corp. is making progress in overcoming
the three unrelated problems that cut first-half profit 49%,
Adolph Posnick, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
Barring a war in the Middle East, Ferro's second-half profit
will exceed the first half's, he said.
   Meanwhile, the global producer of specialty coatings,
plastics and chemicals is building a base for sharply higher
profit in the next few years, he said in an interview.

   Ferro obtains more than half its sales and over 75% of its
profit abroad. Domestic profit margins are lower than those
abroad, partly because the company incurs most product
development expense in the U.S. Successful products are
exported to foreign markets, and some eventually are produced
abroad.
   That global strategy offers great growth opportunity as
trade barriers decline around the world, Mr. Posnick said. He
said Europe's prospects are especially promising for the
1990s, but many developing countries where Ferro does
business also are likely to fare better than they did in the
1980s. However, operating in 22 countries also exposes the
company to numerous foreign problems, such as Brazil's
economic turmoil this year.
   Mr. Posnick didn't make a specific second-half earnings
forecast, but he said management doesn't quarrel with analyst
estimates that Ferro will earn $1.50 to $1.70 a share for the
full year. That would indicate second-half net of 91 cents to
$1.11 a share, compared with $1.07 a share for the 1989
second half.
   In 1989, Ferro earned $49.7 million, or $2.25 a share, on
sales of $1.08 billion.
   First-half net fell to $13.1 million, or 59 cents a share,
from $25.5 million, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier. Sales
rose slightly, to $561.8 million from $546.9 million.
   The company sustained losses in Brazil in the first half
because government efforts to fight inflation practically
brought the economy to a halt last spring, Mr. Posnick said.
Start-up costs of a specialty chemicals plant in France also
cut into Ferro's first-half profit. And the company had lower
earnings from specialty plastics, mainly because of lower
shipments and weaker prices for reinforced plastics sold to
the auto industry.
   First-half profit would have been more than twice as high
if it hadn't been for those three problems, Mr. Posnick said.
   Ferro so far has felt little impact from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Posnick said. The company has no
plants and only limited sales in those two countries.
Eventually, higher oil prices probably will push up the cost
of basic plastic resins and other raw materials, said Albert
C. Bersticker, president and chief operating officer.
However, that hasn't happened so far. In fact, resin
producers in recent weeks failed in several efforts to raise
prices, Mr. Bersticker said.
   Ferro closed four of its five Brazilian plants for a time
last spring when the government was trying to wring inflation
out of the economy, Mr. Posnick said. The plants currently
are operating at 60% to 70% of capacity, and Brazilian
operations will earn a small profit for the third quarter, he
said. Ferro is optimistic about the longer-term outlook for
its businesses in Brazil, he added.
   It appears that the governments of Brazil, Argentina,
Venezuela and Mexico are making headway in their battle with
high debt, government deficits and inflation, Mr. Posnick
said. They're also opening up their economies to world trade.
Those trends, if continued, will make Ferro's Latin American
operations increasingly profitable, he said. Ferro obtained
nearly 12% of its sales and about 25% of its profit in Latin
America during 1988 and 1989.
   Ferro's plant start-up expense in France is an investment
to prepare for the 1992 breakdown of remaining trade barriers
across most of Western Europe, Mr. Posnick said. Ferro
previously supplied specialty chemicals to European customers
from small plants in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom
and from U.S. facilities, Mr. Posnick said. Early in 1989,
Ferro bought a larger plant in southern France, which has
capacity to supply all of Europe, and has since closed the
two small plants.
   Ferro's French facility is producing additives for fuels
and lubricants. Eventually it also will make additives for
polymers, such as stabilizers and flame retardants for
plastic compounds, said Mr. Bersticker. Start-up has been
slowed by the need to qualify each of the products with
European officials.
   The plant should be profitable for the fourth quarter, Mr.
Posnick said, and longer term it will be a major profit
contributor. The facility is located in an area that has good
access to feedstocks, and it has an excellent incinerator for
disposal of wastes, giving it a competitive advantage, Mr.
Bersticker said.
   Ferro's U.S. specialty plastics business was hurt by the
automotive slowdown, which reduced sales and resulted in
price cutting by competitors fighting for the remaining
business, Mr. Bersticker said. In addition, the company
incurred some unusual costs as it refocused the plastics
operation toward more value-added products, and closed three
small plants.
