   PARIS -- French consumer prices rose 0.3% in July from
June and were up 3.0% from a year earlier, according to
preliminary estimates from the National Statistics Institute.
   The monthly increase was at the low end of market
expectations and follows a monthly rise of 0.2% in June. The
latest result left annual price growth unchanged at 3%.
