   "To the Journal, Pozsgai was a `flabbergasted truck
mechanic' who discovered to his sorrow `how little regard the
Environmental Protection Agency has for property rights' . .
. Balderdash] The Journal's indignation should be focused on
a better cause. The only flabbergasting aspect of this case
can be found in the defendant's flabbergasting contempt for
the law.

   "The government's brief in the Court of Appeals asserted
that the aerial photographs introduced at trial showed the
stream flowing into the canal. That representation, we have
now determined, was inaccurate. We have examined the
photographs and determined that they do not show the stream
flowing into the canal . . . In sum, the record is admittedly
quite thin with regard to the two elements needed to
establish federal jurisdiction {over Mr. Pozsgai's property}.
   -- Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, in a recent Supreme
Court brief.
   ---
   The story of John Pozsgai will stand as a cautionary tale
in the current age of environmental zealotry. Solicitor
General Starr recently acknowledged that federal prosecutors
misrepresented facts to the U.S. Court of Appeals in their
"wetlands" case against John Pozsgai (the subject of a
Journal editorial, "Property Busters," January 11).
   Mr. Pozsgai was sentenced to three years in prison, five
years probation and a fine of $202,000 for placing topsoil
and clean fill on a part of his property that was considered
"wetland" by the EPA. Apparently, Mr. Pozsgai needed a permit
to develop the site, which before he bought it was a landfill
and dumping ground for tires and rusted auto parts. The
government considered most of the dumpsite "wetland," even
though it is not listed in the National Wetland Inventory
Map, and it is not a "marsh, swamp or bog" under the
regulatory definition of "wetland."
   The Justice Department in court claimed that the EPA had
jurisdiction over Mr. Pozsgai's private property because of a
tiny stream adjacent to the property. Justice and the EPA
claimed that the stream flowed into the Pennsylvania Canal,
which is used for "interstate commerce." Justice also claimed
that aerial photographs of Mr. Pozsgai's property showed that
the stream flowed into the canal, creating federal
jurisdiction.
   Well, it turns out that the photographs showed no such
thing. Mr. Starr also says that the fine given to Mr. Pozsgai
by the district court might have been a mistake. Mr.
Pozsgai's lawyers at the Washington Legal Foundation hope
this admission by Justice will move the Supreme Court to hear
the case.
   The blunt use of the "wetland" statute in the Pozsgai case
reflects a troublesome tendency of the environmental movement
to use the full weight of the law and its own heavy arrogance
to bludgeon those who stand in its path.
