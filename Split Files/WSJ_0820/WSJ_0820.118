   OIL PRICES MAY LEVEL OFF in the coming week following
Saudi Arabia's pledge to boost output as much as two million
barrels a day, making up about half the amount lost from the
Iraq-Kuwait embargo. The Saudis plan to take the action with
or without OPEC's approval. Some other oil exporters,
including Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates, also are
expected to increase output. Last week, benchmark U.S. crude
topped $28 a barrel, up about $8 since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2.
