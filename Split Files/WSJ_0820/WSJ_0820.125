   The chairman of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation
has agreed to resign as part of the federal government's
resolution of the troubled guarantee agency's financial woes,
a HEAF spokesman said.
   The spokesman for the private nonprofit corporation based
in Overland Park, Kan., said that Richard Hawk has accepted a
request from the U.S. Department of Education that he step
down.

   The Education Department has been working on a rescue plan
for HEAF, guarantor of $9.3 billion in student loans, since
announcing last month that HEAF was in serious financial
trouble.
   Although the government is reviewing several proposed
plans for other companies to acquire HEAF, it hasn't yet
decided which plan to accept.
   David Westbrook, the HEAF spokesman, said that HEAF has
been reassured by the government that any resolution will not
lead to significant layoffs of HEAF's 800 employees. "Mr.
Hawk's position is that if the (Education Department) needs
someone to be accountable for this problem he's willing to be
that person," Mr. Westbrook said.
   Student Loan Marketing Association, a publicly owned
company, and United Student Aid Funds, a nonprofit loan
guarantor, have each submitted merger rescue plans to the
government as proposed solutions to HEAF's problem.
