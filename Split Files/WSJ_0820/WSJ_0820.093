   Foster Grant Corp. said it filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in
Tucson, Ariz.
   The closely held maker of reading glasses and sunglasses
said it had been hurt by competition from Asia, which has
flooded the U.S. market with cheaper models. Based in
Leominster, Mass., Foster Grant is the second-largest U.S.
manufacturer of sunglasses behind Bausch &amp; Lomb. Last year
Foster Grant sold about $50 million of glasses, 75% of which
were sunglasses.

   As a result of the filing, the company said it would trim
its staff, but it declined to say how large the layoff would
be.
