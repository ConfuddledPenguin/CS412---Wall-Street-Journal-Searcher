   LONDON -- The dispute between the Soviet Union and Russian
Federation about control of key raw material exports is
roiling international commodity markets, dealers say.
   So far, current contracts involving raw materials trade
with the U.S.S.R. haven't been affected. But commodity
dealers and traders are worried about future deals and
whether Soviet state marketing organizations will remain in
charge.

   "I telexed our Moscow office to find out what was going
on, but they are still unsure," says Colin Williams, managing
director of Wogen Resources Ltd., a firm that buys titanium,
rhodium, antimony, mercury and other metals from the Soviet
Union.
   Meanwhile, an official from the U.S.S.R. trade delegation
in London says that policy is "still very much in the air."
He adds: "We must wait until the Russian parliament
reconvenes in early September."
   Soviet exports are presently handled by state
organizations that market and distribute minerals on behalf
of mines and refineries, the U.S.S.R. trade official says.
Western merchants and consumers negotiate firm contracts with
the organizations, which are controlled by the Soviet
Government.
   They include Raznoimport, an exporter and importer of
nonferrous metals; Sojuzneffteexport, which controls sales of
oil, and Glavalmazzolto, a state organization that
distributes platinum, palladium and diamonds through its
international marketing agent Alamazjuvelirexport.
   Concern about raw material contracts with these
organizations arises from a "new union treaty," which
increases the political and economic independence of the
Russian and the 14 other republics in the Soviet Union,
dealers say.
   The Russian Federation became a sovereign state in June
and is jockeying for greater power over exports and imports
of key metals and minerals.
   In the past two weeks, the Russian parliament's presidium
declared that any deals relating to the export of "diamonds,
gold, platinum, precious stones, oil, gas, coal, uranium,
rare earths, nonferrous and ferrous metals, furs, timber,
grain and other strategic resources" were legal only if
concluded jointly by the Soviet Union and Russia, dealers
say.
   The bulk of these materials are produced in Siberia and
other Russian regions.
   "Potential changes could de-stabilize metal markets," says
a base metals dealer who negotiates large contracts with the
Soviet Union. He says that Western companies will be
uncertain whether deals they negotiate will be legally
binding and whether organizations will meet future deliveries
or minerals will be dumped on markets in a disorderly way.
   Only recently, two Soviet state organizations and the
nation's nickel mine and refinery competed with each other to
sell nickel, says Jim Lennon, a research manager at
Commodities Research Unit in London. Such internal
competition could be counterproductive, he says.
   Russia intends to review all export deals negotiated by
the central Soviet government relating to precious metals,
minerals and other resources, said Sergei Shakhrai, chairman
of the Russian parliament's legislative committee, in an
interview with Izvestia, the official Soviet newspaper.
   Foreign embassies and companies would be informed that
such deals were invalid unless concluded with the
participation of the Russian Federation, he said.
   "So far, we haven't heard of any platinum group-metal
contract that has been altered," says Alan Austin, general
manager of the precious metals division of Johnson Matthey
PLC.
   Yet if the declaration becomes law, it will become
problematic to deal with organizations in the Soviet Union,
he says. It would cloud the authority of the marketing
agencies, and Western businessmen would be fearful that
Russian committees could veto contracts.
   Inevitably, there would be bottlenecks because deals would
be kept on ice until approved by Soviet and Russian
officials, Mr. Austin says. The uncertainty would impede the
Soviet Union's foreign trade, he adds.
   De Beers Centenary AG, which recently lent the Soviet
Union $1 billion and concluded a $5 billion contract to sell
Soviet diamonds, is also perplexed about Russia's
declaration.
   "No one from the Soviet Union has instructed us that our
contract is null and void," a De Beers spokesman says. This
is hardly surprising, he says, since no one but De Beers
would absorb such a large amount of diamonds.
   Dealers say it would be a problem for the U.S.S.R. and
Russia if efficient marketing agencies are either dismantled
or lose authority.
   For example, Vnesheconombank, which sells gold, and the
marketing agent Alamazjuvelirexport are shrewd organizations,
which obtain the best available prices for the Soviet Union,
according to precious metals dealers.
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice
                                                                                                       

   An unexpected cut in the export price of frozen
concentrated orange juice from Brazil triggered a plunge in
New York futures prices. The September contract dropped
almost 10 cents a pound, to $1.7065 from $1.8060.
   But Brazil's price cut, to $1.85 a pound from $2.12, could
help sow the seeds of an eventual price resurgence by
contributing to greater demand in Europe. Europe is the main
competitor of the U.S. for the Brazilian product, noted
Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "And
with the dollar so low, strong European demand for the juice
could be stimulated and draw supplies away from the U.S.,
causing U.S. prices to rise."
   The Brazilian move was a long-delayed reaction to a sharp
drop in futures in June, to $1.65 from $1.90, when
speculative selling overwhelmed buying by U.S. processors.
U.S. consumer demand for orange juice has been slipping
because of high prices, Ms. Kaul said, and processors have
slowed their buying because the Florida crop turned out to be
more ample than expected after the frost last Christmas.
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Crude oil futures prices this week will go higher to flirt
with $30 a barrel if market participants continue to bet on
U.S. military intervention in the Persian Gulf, which they've
seen as a bullish prospect. Prices will fall back again if
traders and brokers instead take heed of new indications that
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other producers will pump
additional oil to fill the void left by the embargo against
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. If the upward pressures continue,
September gasoline futures prices could top $1 a gallon. They
jumped 8.51 cents a gallon Friday to 95.97 cents on Middle
East crisis talk and word that some Atlantic Richfield Co.
stations ran out of regular unleaded gasoline. ARCO froze its
prices to counter charges that oil companies were gouging
customers following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices this week are likely to fluctuate with
events in the Mideast as traders weigh the prospects for a
recession against the possibility that an escalation of
hostilities in the desert could spur an inflationary price
surge in the U.S. "It sounds bad, but wars are normally
friendly to grains" as a result of the inflationary push they
tend to give an economy, said one futures analyst. In such
situations demand for grain and soybeans typically picks up
as users, fearing higher prices in the future, boost their
stockpiles. In periods of recession and slack demand, prices
usually fall. Soybean futures prices are also being supported
by continued worries that the rain-delayed crop may suffer
this fall if an early frost sets in across many growing
regions. On Friday, soybean futures for November delivery
gained 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $6.2875 a bushel, and
December corn futures added one cent a bushel to close at
$2.4550 a bushel. December wheat futures prices slid 2.25
cents a bushel to close at $2.97 a bushel.
