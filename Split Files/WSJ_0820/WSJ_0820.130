   TOKYO -- Annual growth in orders from Japan's machinery
industry slowed to 4.8% in June, the Economic Planning Agency
said.
   While still healthy, growth was down from double-digit
rates seen in four of the previous five months. Machinery
orders increased 13% in May.

   Despite weakness in the private sector, an official said
the agency expects growth to accelerate. Private-sector
orders should rebound as business investment is strong, she
said.
   The agency said orders to machinery makers totaled 1.933
trillion yen ($13.12 billion) in June. On a seasonally
adjusted basis, orders totaled 1.859 trillion yen, down 1.4%
from May.
   Private capital investment in such big-ticket items as
machinery is one of two primary factors in Japan's current
economic boom. Together with high personal consumption,
capital investment has kept the nation's economy growing for
44 consecutive months, the second-longest expansion since the
World War II.
   Orders from the private sector fell to 1.09 trillion yen,
down 13% from year-earlier levels. On a seasonally adjusted
basis, orders totaled 967.88 billion yen, down 14%. June was
the second consecutive month in which private-sector orders
fell; in May, private-sector orders dropped 5.5%.
   The official pointed to strong growth in private-sector
orders in April and preceding months as evidence orders will
rebound.
   Within the private sector, orders from shipbuilders
increased 29% in June, while orders from the
commercial-fishing industry rose 11%.
   Orders from the paper industry, meanwhile, plunged 55% and
orders from steel makers fell 28% in June.
   Public-sector machinery orders increased 4.2% in June to
153.97 billion yen. On a seasonally adjusted basis,
public-sector orders fell 1.6% to 217.15 billion yen.
   Overseas orders rose 71% to 545.98 billion yen. On a
seasonally adjusted basis, they rose 18% to 536.25 billion
yen.
