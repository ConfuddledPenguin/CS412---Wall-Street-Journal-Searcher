   OTTAWA -- Canada's consumer price index rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.4% in July from June, Statistics Canada, a federal
agency, said.
   The increase was the same rate as that recorded in June.
The July boost was mainly attributed to increases in
transportation and food prices.

   Separately, Statistics Canada reported that Canada's
merchandise trade surplus widened to 1.73 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.51 billion) in June, partly because of a sharp
drop in imports. In May the surplus totaled C$630 million.
