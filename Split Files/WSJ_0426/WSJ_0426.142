   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- Genentech Inc. reported an
80% surge in first-quarter net income, but the biotechnology
company said it expects a loss for the year because of
expenses related to the sale of a controlling interest in the
firm to Roche Holding Ltd.
   Profit in the quarter rose to $13.3 million, or 15 cents a
share, from $7.4 million, or nine cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue jumped 32% to $120.2 million from $91.1 million.

   The latest quarter was aided by a 14% increase in sales of
Activase, the company's heart-attack drug. Sales rose to
$54.9 million from $48.1 million.
   Genentech said it incurred $11.7 million, or about 12
cents a share, in expenses during the latest quarter related
to its previously announced $2.1 billion sale of 60% of the
company to Roche Holding, Basil, Switzerland. Overall,
merger-related expenses are expected to total about $150
million when the transaction is completed, resulting in a
loss for the year, Genentech said.
   For 1989, the company had net income of $44 million, or 51
cents a share, on revenue of $400.4 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Genentech closed at $26, up 12.5 cents.
