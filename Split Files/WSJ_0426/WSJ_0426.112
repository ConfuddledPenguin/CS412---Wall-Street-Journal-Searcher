   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., still struggling under a
mountain of debt incurred in a 1987 recapitalization, may
sell some of its publishing operations to Thomson Corp.
   Eugene McCarthy, a Harcourt director, said yesterday that
Harcourt's board met Monday to discuss the possible sale of
some of its assets to Thomson, the Toronto-based publishing
and travel concern.

   "Thomson hasn't asked to buy the whole company," Mr.
McCarthy said. "{It} has only been offered part of the
company."
   Mr. McCarthy, the former U.S. senator, said the two
companies have been in talks for the past month, although he
said he didn't know who initiated the discussions. Harcourt
late yesterday evening confirmed that it has "had discussion
with certain parties with respect to possible transactions."
Peter Jovanovich, Harcourt's president and chief executive
officer, said the possible transactions involve, among other
things, offers for some or all of the publishing and
insurance company's existing public debt at a discount from
its aggregate book value, as well as the acquisition of
certain assets of Harcourt by a third party.
   But Mr. Jovanovich declined to identify any third party or
what assets might be sold. He said that the discussions have
been preliminary and that no agreements have been reached. He
added that there is no assurance that negotiations will
progress or that a transaction will be completed.
   He also said in a prepared statement that Orlando,
Fla.-based Harcourt isn't for sale. Meanwhile, executives at
Thomson couldn't be reached for comment.
   For Harcourt, the sale of one of its publishing units
would mark another step in the unraveling of the company that
began in 1987. That was the year William Jovanovich,
Harcourt's chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion
recapitalization to evade a takeover by British publishing
mogul Robert Maxwell, plunging Harcourt into more than $2
billion of debt. The interest costs proved so onerous that
last summer -- despite previous denials that it would need to
shed assets -- the company sold its prized Sea World theme
parks for a $1.1 billion, a price below what analysts had
thought the parks were worth.
   In the past several months, as Harcourt's stock has
languished, many publishing-industry executives and analysts
have expected the company to sell more assets to help pay
down debt. But the company's apparent talks with Thomson
baffled some observers, who had identified Harcourt's
insurance units as the most likely candidates for
divestiture.
   "They have no business being in insurance," said one
publishing executive close to the company, "because nobody on
the board knows {anything} about it."
   Charles Elbaum, president of Publishing Economics Inc., a
consulting firm in New York, said Thomson is probably after
one or both of Harcourt's medical and scientific publishing
companies, Academic Press and W.B. Saunders. Both units
garner about $140 million in revenue per year and are
Harcourt's "crown jewels," Mr. Elbaum said, earning "very
significant" pre-tax profit margins.
   Another possible target is Harcourt's legal publishing
unit, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal &amp; Professional
Publishers Inc. While the unit is small, Thomson has a
demonstrated interest in acquiring similar specialty
publications. Last May it paid $810 million to buy Lawyers
Co-operative Publishing Co. in Rochester, N.Y., making
Thomson one of the top three legal publishers in the U.S.
   Harcourt's other major publishing arm, its elementary and
high school textbook division, has done poorly in the past 18
months after failing to meet changing demands by educators.
The unit became saddled with so many unwanted books that
Harcourt had to take an $88 million writeoff last year to
cover obsolete inventory.
   The apparent interest by Thomson in Harcourt's assets also
puzzled analysts, since Thomson has repeatedly said it wants
time to digest its 1989 acquisitions. In its annual report,
the company said that only outstanding opportunities will be
pursued.
   The Canadian concern would be able to finance such a
transaction with considerable ease, however. It is on record
as saying it doesn't want to move beyond a debt-to-equity
ratio of 1-to-1, which would still leave the company with
resources of about $1 billion to draw upon if acquisition
opportunities presented themselves.
   "I don't think Thomson would be interested in . . . all of
Harcourt," said Ella Brown, an analyst with Richardson
Greenshields in Toronto. "But they're likely to take a
serious look at some of the parts."
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Harcourt closed at $4.125, up 12.5 cents.
   Separately, a unit of Thomson, American Banker-Bond Buyer,
said it acquired the assets of Rand McNally &amp; Co.'s Financial
Publishing division.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
   American Banker-Bond Buyer is a New York information
company with specialty-publishing activities in banking,
securities and financial information services. Among its
publications are the national daily newspapers American
Banker and the Bond Buyer.
   With Rand McNally's Financial Publishing division, the
Thomson unit is getting a number of national and
international banking directories. Also, the division, with
about 75 employees, administers the routing numbers by which
checks are sorted and cleared through banks around the
country, under a contract with the American Bankers
Association.
   Rand McNally is a closely held publisher based in Skokie,
Ill.
