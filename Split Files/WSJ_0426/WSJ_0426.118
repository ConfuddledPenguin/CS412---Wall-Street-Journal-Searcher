   McGraw-Hill Inc. said it is considering the sale of a
15%-to-30% stake in Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing
Co., its school publishing joint venture with Macmillan Inc.
   Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of
the New York-based publishing and information services
company, declined to elaborate on the timing and the exact
size of the offering. The joint-venture partner, Macmillan,
is the New York-based publishing unit of Maxwell
Communication Corp., of London.

   McGraw-Hill said that the joint venture, formed last year,
posted a first-quarter loss. But McGraw-Hill's share of the
loss -- $12.8 million -- was "actually less than expected."
   The joint venture company's revenue for the six months
ended Dec. 31 was $286.4 million. McGraw-Hill's share of the
operating profit was $17.8 million.
