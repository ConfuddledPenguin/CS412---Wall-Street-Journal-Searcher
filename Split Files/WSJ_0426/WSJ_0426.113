   THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES could manage only a break-even
season in 1974, but off the gridiron they made history when
they helped to create the first Ronald McDonald House. Today,
129 of these offer shelter and solace each year to half a
million people with seriously ill children.
   Twenty years ago, Eagle tight end Fred Hill's 3-year-old
daughter Kim was stricken with lymphatic leukemia. He decided
to make fighting the disease his cause and asked the club to
help. Owner Leonard Tose responded by pledging "the team, the
stadium, whatever we have."
   Eagle general manager Jim Murray started a fund-raising
campaign and soon could present a $125,000 check to Audrey
Evans, head of pediatric oncology at Philadelphia's
Children's Hospital, as down payment for a new wing. Dr.
Evans responded with a new request -- could she get a place
where families could afford to stay while their children were
being treated?
   Mr. Murray found ready support from Edward Renzi, then
McDonald's Corp.'s regional manager, who suggested calling
the planned hostel the Ronald McDonald House, after the food
chain's clown mascot. Mr. Renzi's local franchisers began
special promotions to raise money for the project.
   By Christmas 1974, the first house was open and operating,
with seven families. Today, the "Ronald houses," as the
families  call them, are in the U.S., Canada, England,
Holland, Germany and Australia.
   The pattern is the same everywhere. Each house is operated
by a nonprofit corporation and staffed by volunteers, except
for a paid manager. Each is near a hospital treating
children, and families are charged $5 to $15 a day if they
can afford it, nothing if they can't. They remain for as long
as their child is undergoing treatment. The children stay
with their mothers and fathers between treatments (many are
outpatients) and the families help with as much housekeeping
as they choose.
   Mr. Renzi, now president of McDonald's U.S.A., and Mr.
Murray, who left the Eagles to set up his own sports
marketing business, are still mainsprings. Mr. Murray is the
unpaid volunteer president of McDonald's advisory committee
for the houses and does missionary work for them.
   Mr. Renzi wears three hats -- president of McDonald's,
chairman of the advisory committee ("I'm a cheerleader") and
head of Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, set up in 1983
to honor Ray Kroc, the chain's founder. The houses got a
third of the $22 million in grants the charities have made.
   The smallest Ronald McDonald House is a modest
four-bedroom one in Marshfield, Wis.; the largest will be a
90-room center planned in New York City on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan. (The latter will also be the most
expensive, running between $15 million and $20 million.) They
average 15 bedrooms; the total for all 129 is 1,700.
   An estimated one million people have volunteered to help,
many of them professional athletes; some 24 of the National
Football League's 28 clubs are involved, baseball's Minnesota
Twins help with a house in Minneapolis, and basketball
superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls gives both time
and money.
   Generosity, Mr. Renzi says, is the secret. "You can find
money anywhere," he says, "this is people helping people. It
isn't  about egos, it's about angels."
   Kim Hill, whose critical illness in 1969 started it all,
is now a healthy California mother who helps her father run a
McDonald's restaurant in San Juan Capistrano.
