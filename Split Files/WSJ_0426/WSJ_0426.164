   Attorneys for Leona Helmsley said the hotel queen should
have been acquitted of tax-evasion charges last year because
she actually overpaid her taxes.
   In December, Mrs. Helmsley was sentenced to four years in
prison and fined $7.2 million after being convicted of
evading $1.2 million in taxes in 1983-85. Currently free on
bail pending her appeal, Mrs. Helmsley also is on trial in
New York state court for alleged state tax violations.

   The appellate brief maintains that before Mrs. Helmsley
could be convicted of evading taxes, prosecutors had to prove
that she actually owed taxes for those three years. The brief
was filed with a federal appeals court in New York by a team
of defense attorneys led by Harvard Law School Professor Alan
Dershowitz.
   "The defense introduced unrebutted testimony clearly
establishing that the Helmsleys' joint federal income tax
returns for each of those years overstated their joint
taxable income and tax," the brief said. Mrs. Helmsley's
husband, real-estate magnate Harry Helmsley, was initially
charged in the case but later was dropped as a defendant
after the trial judge found him mentally unfit to stand
trial.
   The brief accuses the government of being overzealous in
its pursuit of the case. "The government should not have been
`surprised' by the fact that a re-examination and
recalculation resulted in the Helmsleys having actually
overpaid their taxes during these years," the brief said.
   The attorneys said Mrs. Helmsley was charged with evading
only 3% of the total taxes that the U.S. said she owed for
those three years. Prosecutors should have expected that a
review of the tax returns could have turned up enough new
information to offset the relatively small amount that
allegedly was evaded, the brief said.
   The recalculation involves mistakes that Mrs. Helmsley's
attorneys say were made regarding the depreciation of certain
property.
   Mrs. Helmsley's attorneys claim she overpaid taxes by
$21,000 to $477,000 annually during the three years. Similar
claims were made during the trial but were rejected by Judge
John Walker.

   TEXAS JUDGE sets aside $39.4 million verdict against
nursing home.
   State District Judge Scott A. Brister said plaintiffs'
attorneys violated Texas procedures and his instructions in
winning the jury verdict, believed to be one of the largest
ever in a nursing home case. Concluding that the attorneys'
actions prevented the defendant from getting a fair hearing,
Judge Brister declared a mistrial and ordered a new trial.
   The verdict, issued March 22, awarded damages to the
family of an 84-year-old woman strangled by a restraining
device in the nursing home, Seven Acres Jewish Geriatric
Center. The woman, Jennie Zetterbaum, died in 1984 after
being placed in a vest-like apparatus used to keep patients
in their beds. She was found suspended on the side of her bed
with the restraint wrapped under her arms and neck.
   The lawsuit, tried on the plaintiffs' side by Houston
attorneys Anthony Montgomery and Tom Hornbuckle, alleged
Seven Acres negligently violated state and federal nursing
home regulations, and tried to conceal evidence.
   In overturning the verdict, Judge Brister said he wasn't
expressing any opinion on the jury's verdict, adding that he
had "no reason to doubt" it was carefully considered. But
overlooking the misconduct of plaintiffs' attorneys would
"invite attorneys in other cases to ignore the court's rules
and rulings whenever it might benefit their case," he said.
   Judge Brister didn't specify what the plaintiffs'
attorneys had done wrong. But counsel for the nursing home,
Richard L. Reedy of Kain &amp; Reedy in Houston, asserted they
had made misstatements of fact and had ignored the judge's
pre-trial order not to introduce certain evidence -- aimed at
supporting allegations of a coverup, for example. "We hope
when the case is retried, the plaintiffs' lawyers will behave
themselves," he said.
   Messrs. Montgomery and Hornbuckle didn't return telephone
calls.

   FALSE-AD CLAIMS about home ice-cream maker melt in court.
   A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed a false-advertising
lawsuit brought by home ice-cream maker giant Nikkal
Industries Inc. against Salton Inc., one of its newer
competitors. The judge said that even though some of Salton's
marketing could be potentially misleading, the company didn't
use deceptive advertising to promote its product.
   A main issue in the case was the ice cream's
"scoopability," referring to whether dessert made in the
non-electric ice-cream makers is firm enough to be scooped
onto a cone. But after hearing from two professors who served
as expert witnesses -- including one who had developed a
"scoopability" standard -- Judge Charles Tenney said the
disputed characteristic is too subjective to measure.
   Judge Tenney also said it is unlikely customers were
misled by pictures of sculptured mashed potatoes made to look
like scoops of ice cream in Salton's advertisements. The ads
-- which were directed at buyers for retail stores, rather
the general public -- used mashed potatoes in the pictures
because ice cream would melt under the lights.
   Judge Tenney rejected Nikkal's claims that the Salton ads
caused the company to lose millions of dollars in sales.
Instead, Nikkal itself was partly to blame, the judge said.
   "Nikkal's own marketing strategy played the predominant
role in the decline of sales. . . . Despite the increased
competition from companies such as Salton, Nikkal pursued a
strategy that didn't adequately meet the challenge of the
increasingly crowded market," Judge Tenney said in his
opinion. For instance, the judge said, Nikkal ignored its
sales staff's recommendations that it lower prices.
   Officials of Nikkal, based in Virginia Beach, Va., and
company attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.
   Until 1986, when Salton introduced its Big Chill line,
Nikkal was virtually the only distributor of this type of
compact ice-cream maker. The judge said the main purpose of
Nikkal's lawsuit was to prevent Salton from being able to
compete.
   Salton's ice-cream-maker business is now owned by closely
held Sevco Inc. of Deerfield, Ill.

   EX-XEROX COUNSEL leaves post at Latham &amp; Watkins.
   After just 14 months, Robert S. Banks has left his job as
counsel at the New York office of Latham &amp; Watkins, a Los
Angeles law firm with more than 500 lawyers. He has agreed to
serve as outside general counsel of Keystone Holdings Inc., a
company controlled by Texas financier Robert M. Bass.
Keystone's principal asset is American Savings Bank of
Stockton, Calif., a Latham client.
   Mr. Banks, long regarded in legal circles as the chief
architect of the modern corporate law department, surprised
many when he left his post as general counsel of Xerox Corp.
to join Latham. There, he worked primarily as a consultant
for in-house general counsel seeking ways to cut costs and
deal more effectively with outside law firms.
   The unusual arrangement resulted in some
conflict-of-interest problems with other clients at the firm
and difficulties in promoting the new service, said Clinton
R. Stevenson, the former managing partner of Latham who
worked with Mr. Banks on the project.
   "If we had been separate from the law firm it would not
have been as difficult to solve the problems. But I had no
desire to be separate from the law firm," said Mr. Stevenson.
   Mr. Banks said there was also some tension about his
message that companies can sharply cut their outside legal
bills. "It's very difficult to provide the kinds of services
that I want to provide within the framework of a law firm.
I'm still not looked on warmly by partners at law firms," Mr.
Banks said.
   Mr. Banks said he will divide his time between California
and New Canaan, Conn., where he has set up an office. He said
he hopes to help cut American Savings's litigation and
outside legal costs.
