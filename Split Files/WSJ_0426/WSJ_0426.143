   NEW YORK -- The Treasury's auction of two-year notes drew
strong demand from individual investors, but their appetite
wasn't enough to offset the lack of interest among big
investors.
   As a result, the Treasury's $10.5 billion sale of two-year
notes went poorly, causing bond prices to slide. The average
yield on the notes was 8.90%, up from 8.59% at the previous
two-year note auction on March 27 and the highest average
yield at an auction since 9.34% on April 26, 1989.

   The yield attracted near-record participation by
individual investors, who tend to buy at auctions through
so-called "non-competitive" bids. These buyers agree to
accept securities at the average yield. At yesterday's
auction, non-competitive bids totaled $1.91 billion, a little
below the $1.99 billion record non-competitive bids received
at the January 1989 auction.
   But institutional investors shied away from the auction
for fear that interest rates in the U.S. and abroad are
heading higher and that U.S. bonds will continue to erode.
   "The fact that there was no follow-through buying {after
the auction} has market participants a little nervous," said
James Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc. "Some people are saying `if there
is a problem with the two-year auction, heaven forbid what
could happen next month,'" when the Treasury is scheduled to
sell $30 billion of notes and bonds in the quarterly
refunding of the federal debt.
   Details of the refunding will be announced May 2, but
analysts expect the refunding package to resemble the
previous auction in February when the government sold $10
billion each of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.
   Shortly after yesterday's auction results were released,
dealers began marking down prices. Late in the day, the yield
on the new two-year notes was quoted in when-issued trading
activity at 8.94%, well above the auction average of 8.90%.
The fact that the yield moved higher after the auction is
widely viewed as an indication that dealers had trouble
selling the notes and were forced to cut prices, which raises
the yield, to attract buyers.
   Moreover, traders said some speculators purchased two-year
notes early in the day on expectations that prices would
trade higher once the auction results were released. But when
the opposite occurred, they unloaded those securities, which
exerted downward pressure on prices.
   The benchmark Treasury bond also tumbled, but made a
partial comeback just before the market closed. The 30-year
bond ended 1/8 point lower, a loss of $1.25 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, rose slightly to 8.97%.
   Dealers said investors worried that upcoming economic
reports, especially tomorrow's first-quarter gross national
numbers, will show sufficient strength and prompt the Federal
Reserve to tighten credit policy within the next month.
   "The fear of the GNP number on Friday and the implication
it might have for the Fed kept some institutional investors
away from the auction," said David Green, manager of the
government bond trading department at Chemical Bank.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. sprinted
higher on news that part of the giant publisher might be
sold.
   Eugene J. McCarthy, an HBJ outside director, told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report that Harcourt and Thomson
Corp. of Canada have held discussions regarding the sale of
part of the firm. Mr. McCarthy declined to elaborate.
   HBJ's 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures finished 2
1/4 points higher at 79 1/2 after initially rising four
points on the news. The 13% senior notes also gained, ending
2 1/4 points higher at 94 1/2.
   Anne Lorsung, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp;
Maffei Inc., said prices rose on the perception that if
Thomson acquires part of Harcourt Brace, it will retire some
of the debt at a premium.
   "The initial reaction is that a well-capitalized company
takes over a poorly-capitalized company and that could mean
the well-capitalized company will end up guaranteeing the
debt or paying it off at par or some premium," said Ms.
Lorsung. Although she said this would be the "best-case
scenario," even in the "worst-case scenario," where Thomson
would launch an exchange offer for the bonds, holder of debt
are likely to fare well.
   Also higher were junk bonds of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
which continued to advance on Tuesday's news that the U.S.
will allow Michelin Group to proceed with its $1.5 billion
acquisition of the tire maker.
   Uniroyal's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2000, ended at about 113, an increase of about seven points
in the last two sessions.
   Most other junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, prices ended
unchanged.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded issues closed between 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower.
   About $400 million in new corporate debt was priced
yesterday, including a $200 million issue of five-year notes
by Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The noncallable notes were
priced to yield 9.907%. The size of the issue was increased
from an originally planned $150 million.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Long-term British government bonds plunged on news that
the nation's current account and merchandise trade deficits
in March both came in at #2.18 billion ($3.56 billion), up
from #1.39 billion in February. Market expectations had been
for deficits of #1.3 billion.
   British bonds fell more than a point just minutes after
the reports were released. The pound also fell, prompting the
Bank of England to intervene in the foreign exchange markets
in an effort to boost the currency's value.
   "This market has had nothing but bad news for weeks," said
one trader. "Then along come these awful trade numbers and a
lot of investors just figured enough is enough. So they
dumped."
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major attempted to calm
the markets with a series of radio and television interviews.
He blamed the deficits on erratic items and noted that
exports are growing four times as fast as imports.
   He reiterated his belief that the trade data don't warrant
a change in economic policy. Some market participants
interpreted Mr. Major's remarks to suggest that the
government will keep base lending rates at their current
level of 15%.
   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007
fell 1 13/32 points to 94 27/32 to yield 12.48%. Shorter-term
securities posted more modest losses. Futures prices also
slid.
   Elsewhere, West German government bonds ended 1/4 point
higher despite a bearish report from the Bundesbank.
   The central bank warned of rising inflationary risks as
income tax cuts, increased government spending and the
planned monetary union with East Germany boost demand for
goods and services. Monetary union is expected to take effect
July 2.
   West Germany's benchmark 7 3/4% bond due 2000 rose 0.25
point to 93.40 to yield 8.77%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was 32 to yield 8.96% on
Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 96 25/32 to yield
8.98% compared with 96 27/32 to yield 8.97%.
   Short-term rates were a little higher. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.78% for a bond
equivalent yield of 8.025% while the rate on six-month bills
rose to 7.96% to yield 8.387%.
   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
                                                                                                       

   Applications ............................ $26,123,770,000

   Accepted at low price ...................             71%
   Accepted noncompetitively ...............  $1,906,000,000
   Average price (Rate) ....................  99.955 (8.90%)
   High price (Rate) .......................  99.991 (8.88%)

   The notes are dated April 30 and mature April 30, 1992.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities came under pressure after an
institution sold several hundred million dollars of
Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities and
buyers remained scarce. Active mortgage issues fell 3/32 to
7/32.
   Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for May delivery ended at 93 20/32,
down 7/32; its 9 1/2% issue at 96 7/32, down 6/32, and its
10% issue at 98 26/32, down 5/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National
Mortgage Association issues continued to hold up better than
Ginnie Maes because the conventional issues are favored in
derivative transactions. Also, they have shorter average
lives and durations than the Ginnie Maes.
   Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue fell 3/32 to 96 3/32 while
Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% securities dropped 3/32 to 96 5/8.
   Fannie Mae announced two real estate mortgage investment
conduit, or Remic, issues totaling $550 million. That
followed $850 million in Remics issued Tuesday by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.
   In the asset-backed securities market, Citicorp continued
its heavy sales of credit-card certificates, offering a $250
million issue to retail investors through an underwriting
group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   The five-year issue was priced with a bond equivalent
yield of 9.41%, 45 basis points above the Treasury five-year
note. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues slipped as much as 5/8 point in
moderately active dealings.
   "There were a few bid lists and some stuff came back at
new levels," one municipal trader said. "Maybe we'll shake
some people out at these levels," he added.
   Several traders have reported light activity this week, as
investors seem to be biding their time anticipating further
municipal price declines.
   In negotiated action, a Bear Stearns &amp; Co. group set the
preliminary pricing for a $55.1 million issue of New Jersey
Health Care Facilities Finance Authority hospital revenue
bonds. The issue was priced to yield from 8% in 2000 to 8.47%
in 2013.
   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
bonds were 1/2 point lower at 95 1/2 to yield 7.57%. The
bonds have fallen 1 1/2 points in the past week.
