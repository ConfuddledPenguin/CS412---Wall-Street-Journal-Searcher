   AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s first-quarter
net income plunged 78%.
   The earnings drop stemmed from price competition, higher
costs from increased advertising and compensation, and lower
tire demand from auto manufacturers. That lower demand
resulted in temporary Goodyear plant closings.

   The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker announced earlier this
month that it would report sharply reduced earnings; the
decline was in line with analysts' projections. Net was $20.9
million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the year-ago
$94.5 million, or $1.64 a share. Sales were $2.69 billion, up
slightly from $2.64 billion a year earlier.
   Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co.,
Cleveland, said he expected first-quarter net to be between
25 cents and 50 cents a share. "Profit was in line with what
I expected," he said.
   Goodyear said previously that its oil pipeline would
decrease earnings by 50 cents a share, and the pipeline's
losses weren't reflected in the 1989 first-quarter report.
Profits were also squeezed by Brazilian government efforts to
brake inflation in that country, efforts which hurt the
company's large subsidiary there. Goodyear is also incurring
start-up costs on a tire plant in Canada.
