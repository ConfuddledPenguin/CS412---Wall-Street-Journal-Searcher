   STOCKHOLM -- Financier Sven-Olof Johansson will sell his
stake in Saab-Scania AB to the Wallenberg group for 4.4
billion kronor ($717 million), according to news reports,
thus ending a power struggle that began last spring.
   The sale will result in Wallenberg controlling Saab, with
58% of the voting shares.

   Mr. Johansson, who started to comb the market for Saab
shares last spring and early autumn, became its biggest
owner, currently holding 19% of the group's shares and 22% of
its votes.
   The deal was completed a few days before Saab's annual
meeting, to be held tomorrow, the business newspaper Dagens
Industri said yesterday.
   It said the Wallenberg group will have an option to buy
Johansson's 12.8 million shares for 350 kronor (57 cents) a
share. Mr. Johansson, who declined to comment, has previously
said he paid an average of 250 kronor a share. His gain on
the deal is estimated at 1.2 billion kronor.
   Saab-Scania's departing chairman, Sten Gustafsson,
confirmed the Johansson sale, according to the Direkt news
agency.
   Mr. Johansson criticized Saab last autumn when its shares
tumbled 34 kronor over two weeks after rumors of heavy losses
in its car division, for not informing its shareholders of
the seriousness of the crisis.
   Since General Motors Corp. acquired half of Saab's car
division last December, the Swedish auto maker's shares have
regained ground, however, and closed at 296 kronor Tuesday.
