   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed the commercial
paper of Sotheby's Inc. on its CreditWatch with negative
implications, after the giant auction house announced plans
for a joint venture to purchase the Pierre Matisse Gallery's
extensive art inventory for $142.8 million.
   Sotheby's is a unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., New York.
The unit's commercial paper carries a top single-A-1 rating
from S&amp;P and is guaranteed by Sotheby's Holdings. Moody's
Investors Service Inc., the other major rating agency, hasn't
rated the company's commercial paper.

   Sotheby's didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the
S&amp;P move.
   Carla Kennedy Newman, an S&amp;P analyst, said that Sotheby's
is taking on "a new risk, inventory risk, that wasn't there
before" by purchasing the gallery inventory. "The company
hasn't played as a principal in the art market before, except
in very limited ways, but it's doing it in a big way this
time," she said.
   With the purchase, Ms. Newman said, Sotheby's is
essentially "working as a merchant banker, a broker," in the
art market.
   Sotheby's said it had arranged to purchase the Matisse
Gallery's 2,300-painting inventory, in a joint venture with
Acquavella Contemporary Art Inc., owned by New York art
dealer William Acquavella. Mr. Acquavella will serve as the
venture's managing director, with profits from the sale of
paintings to be split equally between himself and Sotheby's.
   The auction house will raise the purchase price for the
inventory through the commercial paper sale, then lend the
money to the joint venture, which will pay an undisclosed
rate of interest.
   Mr. Acquavella said that "the financing could have been
obtained by other sources" but that he was seeking "a partner
who could help me market this is in best fashion possible."
Mr. Acquavella will decide which works will be sold privately
or at auction.
   The works owned by the New York-based Matisse Gallery
include works by Joan Miro, Jean Dubuffet and Marc Chagall,
almost all acquired directly from the artists themselves.
Several of the works have been off the market and in
warehouses for years, Mr. Acquavella said. Pierre Matisse,
who died in August 1989, was the son of painter Henri Matisse
and represented many of those artists.
   "Wall Street just picks on the negatives," Mr. Acquavella
said of the S&amp;P move. "Here's a deal where Sotheby's has
something -- not just air and a franchise -- with tremendous
upside potential."
   Separately, Sotheby's held a meeting of Wall Street
analysts who follow the company. The auction house's stock
recently has fallen sharply in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Yesterday it closed up 75 cents a share to
$18.50.
   Salomon Brothers analyst Harvey Katz said he views the
venture with Mr. Acquavella as "a positive" for the company.
"Sotheby's, because of its flexibility and liquidity, was
able to step up to the plate and gain a substantial
consignment on favorable terms," he said.
