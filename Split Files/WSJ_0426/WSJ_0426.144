   CUYAHOGA HEIGHTS, Ohio -- American Steel &amp; Wire Corp. said
it received letters of commitment for $95 million of
financing.
   The steel rod and wire maker said the money will be used
to pay for capital spending, working capital, refinancing
debt and for paying a possible special cash dividend of as
much as $4.25 a share. The company said its board will weigh
the special payout, once it completes financing
documentation.

   Financing will come from Security Pacific Business Credit
Inc., Sanwa Business Credit Corp., State Bank of South
Australia and Cigna Investments Inc.
   American Steel &amp; Wire is composed of three former USX
Corp. plants acquired in 1986 through a leveraged buy-out.
The company went public two years later and now is
50.7%-owned by Chicago West Pullman Corp., a Cincinnati-based
transportation and manufacturing concern controlled by Roger
W. Ach II, a businessman.
