   Yields on money-market mutual funds remained flat in the
week ended Tuesday, despite recent increases in short-term
interest rates.
   The average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds
stayed at 7.99% for the third consecutive week, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.

   Assets of the 428 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's fell
for the fourth consecutive week, to $381.7 billion from
$382.1 billion. Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of the
newsletter, which is based in Holliston, Mass., attributed
the latest decline to withdrawals for tax purposes.
   Meanwhile yields on many other short-term investments
rose. The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's
auction, for instance, shot up to 8.35% from 8.18% the week
before, while three-month bills rose to 8.05% from 7.97%.
Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service,
reported earlier this week that yields on certificates of
deposit at major banks rose across the board in the week
ended Tuesday.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments remained at a
relatively long 44 days for the second consecutive week,
following several weeks of 45 days; maturities have ranged
from 29 to 53 days in recent years. Funds invest in such
things as commercial paper, short-term Treasury securities
and certificates of deposit.
   "We may see average maturities shorten if {portfolio}
managers are taking this talk of an inflation threat
seriously," said Ms. Negus of Donoghue's. Shorter maturities
typically are considered a sign that money managers think
interest rates are rising, because they can then latch onto
higher yields sooner. Conversely, longer maturities usually
are thought to indicate declining rates.
   The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.69% in
the week ended Tuesday, while the 30-day simple yield inched
up to 7.69% from 7.68%. The average 30-day compound yield
moved to 7.99% from 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free money funds rose by about 0.10
percentage point in the week ended Tuesday, although assets
fell. The average seven-day compound yield on tax-exempt
funds, for example, jumped to 5.74% from 5.63%. The latest
week's yield is equivalent to 7.97% for investors in the 28%
tax bracket and 8.57% for those paying 33%.
   Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
fell by about $916 million, to $76.6 billion. Average
maturity shortened to 43 days from 45.
