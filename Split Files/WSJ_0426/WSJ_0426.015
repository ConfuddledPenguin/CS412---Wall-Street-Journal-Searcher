   Here's the problem about a boat
   That's not in sea-chanty songs:
   There's no place to put anything
   Except where it belongs.
   -- Ruth Boorstin.

   Exit Lines
                                                                                                       

   As a rule of thumb for house guests,
   Try to look at it this way:
   The time for leaving is best
   While they're still urging you to stay.

   The secret of being a bore is to tell everything.
