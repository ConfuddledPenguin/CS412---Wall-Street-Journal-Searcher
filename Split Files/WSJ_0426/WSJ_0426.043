   Cattle drives at the Y.O. Ranch are usually models of
efficiency, requiring but nine cowboys to handle 70 or 80
longhorn steers.
   This weekend, however, the central Texas ranch will be
saddled with 150 new cowhands trying to do the same job. The
steers may never stop laughing.

   The weekend wranglers, you see, are the tenderest of
tenderfeet, recipients of a "Christmas in April"
cowboy-fantasy package from Neiman Marcus's most recent
Christmas catalog. For a mere $627 a person, would-be cowboys
and cowgirls get two nights at the Y.O. Hilton in nearby
Kerrville, a cocktail party, a Saturday night dinner-dance
and the rare privilege of driving a herd of longhorns across
15 miles of the ranch's mesquite-strewn, 45,000-acre range.
Within two hours after the phone lines opened for
reservations last fall, all 150 spots were filled.
   Among those horsing around this weekend will be lawyers,
doctors and real-estate investors from New York and Beverly
Hills and dozens of spots in between, and the ranch isn't
expecting to saddle up a lot of experienced cowhands. "It's
going to be a hoot," confides one of the organizers.
   The Y.O. has hired 100 real cowboys to protect the
longhorns from the greenhorns. But the cattle probably won't
be cowed; they're veteran performers. Docile despite their
menacing-looking three-foot horns, the steers are part of the
ranch's so-called "Hollywood" herd, which has performed in
cigarette commercials and at the 1984 Republican convention
in Dallas. Their regular gig is posing for the ranch's
photo-taking safaris. "They're well-traveled and used to fame
and fortune," says a spokeswoman for the ranch.
   There will be dangers, though. Ranch officials have warned
against the wearing of halter tops and shorts, since a nearly
nude dude could ride home with a bad sunburn and nasty saddle
sores. "A full day in the saddle when you aren't used to it
can have rewards of its own," says Walter Schreiner, trail
boss and ranch owner.
   The Y.O., a real working ranch credited with preventing
the vanishing of the longhorn breed from the West, wants
these greenhorns to have a very good time. After all, the
ranch just happens to have about 4,000 acres for sale to
those who find they want to trade in their city duds for
good. "Some of these wives who thought they were just buying
their husbands a weekend on a ranch might end up there
forever," the spokeswoman says.
