   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Network Equipment Technologies
Inc., troubled by a breakdown in documenting orders and
shipments, said it expects to operate at a loss or break-even
point for the near term.
   The communications network designer said an internal
investigation showed that its policies on orders and
shipments were not being followed. A spokesman said that
controls broke down in its eastern region, one of the
company's four, and that the problems were limited to that
region.

   Network said $519,000 in invalid orders occurred in the
fiscal second quarter and that an additional $5.4 million of
invalid orders occurred in the third quarter, although a
subsequent audit confirmed $2.4 million of the third-quarter
orders.
   The news sent Network's stock reeling. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, its shares closed down $6.875, or
nearly 50%, to $9.25, on heavy volume of 1.5 million shares.
Network's stock had been moving steadily higher over the past
year, rising from $18 a share in 1988 to a recent high of
$34.375 shortly before its reverses.
   "Procedures and the system were in place. They just
weren't followed," the company spokesman said. In a
statement, Network said a committee of outside directors was
now studying the problem, and that the company also was
attempting to confirm orders in the pipeline and backlogs.
The invalid shipments, the company added, prompted a
restatement of its fiscal second and third quarters ended
Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.
   Analysts weren't entirely surprised by the news. Earlier
this month, the company hinted that it was investigating
invalid shipments. But with the company's full disclosure
yesterday, analysts said a host of nettlesome questions have
been raised.
   "The concerns are backlog and how much of it is going to
be missing when their review is complete," said Cecilia
Brancato, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Ms. Brancato also
said questions involve internal controls at the company and
underlying demand for its products.
   As a result of the sales irregularities, Network said it
restated its results for the fiscal second and third
quarters. A $519,000 reversal in revenue because of an
invalid order depressed second-quarter net to $4.9 million,
or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $47.2 million, compared
with the previously reported $5.1 million, or 36 cents a
share, on revenue of $47.5 million.
   In the third quarter, invalid orders resulted in restated
results of $3.1 million, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of
$46.7 million, down from the previously reported $5.6
million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $52 million.
   This represents the latest setback for the company. Until
recently, Network was touted as one of the hottest players in
a burgeoning industry that produces affordable networks of
computers and phones. But last week, in an embarrassing
retreat, the company said results for the fiscal fourth
quarter ended March 31 would be worse than a pessimistic
projection it made just two weeks ago.
   For the quarter, net plunged nearly 87% to $611,000, or
four cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 33 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter increased almost 18% to $45.7 million
from $38.8 million.
   Separately, Network said it was sued in federal court in
San Francisco by a group of shareholders who bought the
company's stock between November 1988 and this month. The
suit alleges securities law violations, among other things.
The company said it intends to contest the charges.
