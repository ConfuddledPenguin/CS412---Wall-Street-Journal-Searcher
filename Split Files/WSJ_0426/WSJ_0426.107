   HOUSTON -- Activists kicking off their campaign to force
corporate America to safeguard the environment won a symbolic
victory at Exxon Corp.'s annual meeting.
   Six environmental proposals offered by Exxon shareholders
-- and opposed by management -- failed to pass, winning far
less than a majority of the nonbinding vote. But the measures
garnered a larger share of votes than expected, and more than
first-time proposals usually receive. They included
initiatives to have Exxon make public an "environmental
audit," press on with its cleanup in Alaska and reduce
ozone-damaging carbon-dioxide emissions at all of its
facilities.

   "This is just the beginning," said Brent Blackwelder, vice
president of Friends of the Earth. "It signals the first
serious attempt to put strong environmental pressures on a
big oil company."
   With yesterday's results as a springboard, environmental
groups hope to carry their demands for support beyond the
municipal and state pension funds that helped them at Exxon
to other institutional investors, such as banks and insurers.
"We're going to keep the heat on Exxon and other companies,"
said Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation,
the nation's largest conservation organization.
   The 4 1/2-hour meeting, which the environmental community
had been anticipating and Exxon fearing for weeks, proved to
be subdued and orderly, with few of the promised pickets
outside the big convention center here. Unlike last year's
raucous gathering, in which shareholders queued up to gain
control of microphones, yesterday many microphones sat unused
by the crowd of more than 1,800.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl tempered his typically
feisty repartee and struck a conciliatory tone with most who
challenged him. In fact, he agreed to try to grant a request
by Mr. Hair, one of his most vocal critics. "I would be
pleased if we could arrange" a joint trip to Alaska with the
environmentalist to examine Exxon's progress in the second
year of its oil-spill cleanup effort, Mr. Rawl said.
   When one shareholder demanded his resignation, Mr. Rawl
said simply, "Thank you. I appreciate it. Next."
   One notable disruption to Mr. Rawl's calm came when
questioned about Exxon's resistance to double-hulled oil
tankers, which are supposed to be spill-resistant. "What are
you telling me to do? Spend $125 million?" Mr. Rawl demanded,
referring to the projected cost of building just one such
tanker for use in Alaska. "Your time is up," he said and
called on another shareholder, only to discover a former
employee proposing to give up part of his dividends to
finance such vessels. Mr. Rawl told the shareholder he
doubted many others in the room felt that way.
   Before the meeting, Mr. Blackwelder said environmental
groups believed a tally of 5% to 7% of the votes cast would
be a dynamic showing. All six shareholder proposals picked up
5.7% or better, with two exceeding 9%.
   Though these numbers may sound small, they are actually
substantial for first-time proposals -- especially in light
of management's opposition. Shareholder initiatives rarely
exceed 5% when first proposed, according to Peg O'Hara,
director of corporate governance at the Investor
Responsibility Research Center in Washington, D.C.
   Even if the proposals presented to Exxon had won a
majority, the company wouldn't have been forced to take any
action since the vote was nonbinding. But in view of the
showing, Exxon's board may review its opposition to some of
the proposals. "These {votes} are not cavalier," says William
Howell, chairman of J.C. Penney &amp; Co. and an Exxon director
since 1982. "We listen. I don't look and say, `Gosh, it's
only 3%.' "
   Some of the proposals probably will show up in Exxon's
proxy next year because all attained the 3% threshold
necessary to be included again, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.
   Several Exxon officials were surprised at the showing,
though they suggested that in spirit they weren't opposed to
some of the ideas. At board meetings, there was "full
discussion" of these issues, one director said.
   Exxon fully supports a list of principles recently adopted
by the American Petroleum Institute, some of which are very
similar to the shareholder proposals, one senior Exxon
executive added.
   But fear of pending litigation was a major factor in the
board's refusal to endorse any of the proposals, Mr. Rawl and
some other directors said. The oil giant faces more than 150
civil suits as well as a criminal action by the state of
Alaska over the oil spill in Prince William Sound. That has
made the company's senior managers leery of taking any stand
that could be used against them.
   Significantly, Exxon's 15 directors won re-election with
more than 98% of the votes cast, an extremely strong showing
given that so many votes were cast against management on the
environmental proposals. "I'm surprised {Mr.} Rawl garnered
that much support," said Doug Cogan, another official at the
Washington-based investor center. "But many of the holders
who were most upset with management have already sold their
stock."
   Receiving the highest votes were the proposals calling for
a renewed cleanup effort in Alaska and for a report on the
company's progress in achieving the so-called Valdez
Principles, a 10-point environmental agenda for corporations.
Many companies already have agreed to provide such reports,
or so-called environmental audits. The cleanup proposal won
9.4% of the vote; the request for an audit, 9.5%
   The proposal calling for reduced emissions of carbon
dioxide, which are said to contribute to global warming, got
6.2% of the vote. Other environmental proposals called for a
supplement to the annual report disclosing hazardous
emissions (5.7%); reduction of toxic chemicals emitted from
Exxon facilities (6.5%) and the establishment of a
board-level environmental affairs committee (5.7%).
   For some time now, Exxon's outside directors have been
conducting their own investigation into who bears
responsibility for the Alaskan spill, but in an interview at
the meeting, Jess Hay, the director leading the probe, said
completion was still four or five months away. The
investigation could find fault with the actions of senior
management as well as Exxon employees directly involved, such
as Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood. Mr. Hay declined to
characterize the findings thus far.
   Initially, directors had expected to complete the study
last fall. "But it became much more involved," Mr. Hay said.
"There were more rabbits to chase down trails than we
thought."
   Other outside directors showed no sign of wavering in
their support for senior management. Asked whether Mr. Rawl
was doing a good job, Mr. Howell, the J.C. Penney executive,
responded, "Absolutely. The tough have to get tougher in
these times."
   The environmental focus of the meeting allowed some
holders with homes near Exxon facilities to complain to
management about toxic emissions and waste disposal that they
claim is ruining their health.
   One woman who lives two blocks from the company's Baytown,
Texas, refinery said she was concerned over the high levels
of cancer among children there and that queries over plant
emissions had gone unanswered. Another woman complained of
toxic materials dumped dangerously close to her home. Mr.
Rawl said he would direct Exxon officials to look into both
cases.
