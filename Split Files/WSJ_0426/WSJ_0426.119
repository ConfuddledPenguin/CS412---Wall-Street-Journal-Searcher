   General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp. said
they received major aircraft engine orders from Thai Airways
International.
   GE said its Aircraft Engines division received a new order
from the state-owned airline valued at $300 million.

   At the same time, Thai Airways said it had placed an order
with United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney division, which
could total $240 million if options for $80 million in extra
engines are executed.
   The order to Pratt &amp; Whitney is significant because it
increases the company's penetration at an airline that until
last July bought GE engines exclusively for 14 years. The
order comes in the wake of a $500,000 gift by United
Technologies to a charity run by the Thai royal family.
   In East Hartford, Conn., a Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman
reiterated the company's position that the donation to a
typhoon-relief fund, which was reported last December, wasn't
conditioned on receiving new engine orders.
   It's natural for the company to engage in philanthropy
"where we want to establish business relationships and become
involved," the spokesman said, adding: "That money was used
to help people {and} it may have been a factor or may not
have" in the engine order decision. "If that helped us in our
business that's fine."
   United Technologies is based in Hartford, Conn., and is
also involved in building systems and automotive products.
GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., has interests in broadcasting,
financial services, and industrial products.
   The competition between the two companies to supply Thai
Airways has intensified during the past year. Last summer,
officials at the airline said the Thai government asked the
carrier to order Pratt &amp; Whitney engines instead of some GE
equipment on order because the government believed Pratt &amp;
Whitney had closer ties to the Bush administration and could
improve Thailand's relations with the U.S. Meanwhile, both
engine makers were said to be offering significant
concessions to the carrier in return for business.
   These latest orders have importance beyond the issue of
which company gets to call Thai Airways its customer.
Thailand is just one prize in a larger sweepstakes for
aerospace concerns as they fight for pieces of Asian
business, the world's fastest-growing commercial aircraft
market.
   According to industry estimates, air passenger traffic to,
from and within Asia will grow an average 9% annually during
the next 10 years, almost twice the projected growth for the
U.S.
   The significance of the Thai Airways business was
underscored yesterday as John F. Welch Jr., GE chairman,
announced at the company's annual meeting in Erie, Pa., the
latest award to GE. The order covers the company's highest
thrust engines, the CF6-80C2 and 80E1, to power five Boeing
Co. 747-400s and four A330s built by Airbus Industrie, the
European aircraft consortium. Both planes are widebody
aircraft.
   The Thai airline will take initial delivery of the
747-400s in late 1991; the A330s are scheduled for delivery
in 1993.
   The order to Pratt &amp; Whitney is for PW4000 engines to
power Airbus A300s, A310s and A330s.
   The order includes the conversion of existing options for
five PW4000-powered A300-600R twinjets into firm orders, and
two PW4000s to power a new Airbus A310 for the Royal Thai Air
Force. Deliveries will begin in 1991. The rest of the order
covers engines for four A330s and spares.
