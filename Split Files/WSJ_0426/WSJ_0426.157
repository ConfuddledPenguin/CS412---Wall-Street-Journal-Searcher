   HOUSTON -- Exxon Corp. said it will begin selling on the
East and Gulf coasts reformulated gasoline designed to
improve air quality.
   The company said the fuel should be available in more than
40 major markets by summer. Exxon expects the new gasoline to
account for more than 50% of the its sales in those markets.

   Exxon is following major rival Shell Oil Co., which
earlier this month introduced a reformulated gasoline, and
several smaller refiners.
   While Exxon said it will sell its new gasoline in both
premium and midgrade unleaded, it shunned the "cleaner"
formulation for the most popular and least costly grade,
regular unleaded. Shell's new fuel is available only in its
most expensive and most profitable octane grade, its premium
unleaded.
   The new gasolines are lower in volatility and specifically
targeted to reduce hydrocarbon emissions in the summer when
ozone problems are most severe.
