   Pitney Bowes Inc., a business equipment and services
marketer, posted a 50% drop in first-quarter net income
because of a one-time year-earlier gain, without which profit
on an operating basis rose 12% on strong sales in the
Stamford, Conn., company's mailing and shipping businesses.
   Profit declined to $59.7 million, or 75 cents a share,
from a restated $119.5 million, or $1.51 a share, a year
earlier, when results included a $66 million gain from an
accounting change. The company is selling its Wheeler Group
office-supply subsidiary, and restated its results to reflect
this as a discontinued operation.
