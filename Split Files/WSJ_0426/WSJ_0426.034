   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden predicted in its annual budget
revision that the deficit on the 1990 current account, or
balance of payments, will widen to 50.7 billion kronor ($8.26
billion) from 32.3 billion kronor in 1989, and that the 1991
current account gap will widen further to 72.4 billion
kronor.
   It forecast a 9.8% rise in consumer prices for this year
and a 9.4% rise for 1991. And it predicted economic growth of
0.8% for 1990 and 0.5% for next year.

   Consumer prices rose 6.7% in 1989, and the government in
January predicted a 7.7% rise this year. The revised spending
plan warns that recent heavy foreign investment by Swedish
companies is hampering the country's economic growth. The
revised economic growth figures are much lower than the
previous spending plan's 1.3% and 1.7% growth targets for
1990 and 1991, respectively.
   Meanwhile, the trade surplus was forecast to decline to 12
billion kronor this year and remain unchanged in 1991, down
from 18.7 billion kronor in 1989.
