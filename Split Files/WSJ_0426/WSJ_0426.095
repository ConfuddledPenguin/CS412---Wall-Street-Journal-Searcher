   International Business Machines Corp. appointed a senior
executive to a sort of trouble-shooter position in which
he'll try to cut through IBM's formidable bureaucracy.
   The computer giant didn't announce the move, but a
spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., confirmed that Stephen B.
Schwartz, a vice president, will be put in charge of a
companywide attempt to cut across organizational lines to
improve customer satisfaction and reduce product defects.

   Mr. Schwartz has a reputation as an effective no-nonsense
manager. The 55-year-old Mr. Schwartz is also one of the 15
or so most senior executives at IBM and has worked closely
over the years with Chairman John F. Akers, to whom he will
report directly. While IBM has had lower-level executives
take cracks over the years at cutting bureaucracy, Mr.
Schwartz's appointment seems to indicate a plan to escalate
that effort.
   "I look upon Schwartz as a sort of shadow government,"
said Sam Albert, a former IBM executive who is now a
consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. "You have to have somebody who
can cut through things, who knows fact from fiction. I think
he's an ideal candidate for that."
   Most recently, Mr. Schwartz ran IBM's AS/400 minicomputer
line, which was perhaps the brightest spot in IBM's product
lineup last year. He also has extensive marketing experience,
having moved up that side of IBM's operations, and spent a
few years overseas, in Japan.
   IBM has already won credit from many customers for
improving communications with them. Yet many customers and
companies that work with IBM still complain that it's hard to
get a decision made quickly. In addition, IBM still can be
much slower on the uptake than competitors when it comes to
new technologies -- such as those that let others dominate
the laptop computer market. IBM also has had some troubling
product defects lately, such as those that limited mainframe
shipments early last year and that delayed by months the
introduction of IBM's high-end disk drives in the 1989 second
half.
   Succeeding Mr. Schwartz as general manager of the AS/400
business is Robert J. LaBant, 45, a vice president who had
been responsible for IBM's direct sales force in the U.S.
   Mr. LaBant will face the difficult job of maintaining the
line's momentum. The 1 1/2-year-old system has already
collected most of the easy sales, from customers who ran out
of power in a predecessor line, the System 38. Now, IBM must
win more difficult business, from users of the other
predecessor, the System 36. Many System 36 users have found
it painfully hard to move their existing software to the
AS/400.
   IBM also named to its corporate management board Ned
Lautenbach, which may mark the first time that two brothers
have been on the 20-or-so-member board at the same time. Mr.
Lautenbach, who runs IBM's application solutions division, is
the younger brother of Terry Lautenbach, who is on the board
because he is responsible for all of IBM's U.S. operations.
