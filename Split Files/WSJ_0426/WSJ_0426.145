   Tokyo stocks ended higher in steady volume Wednesday
despite the yen's further declines against the dollar.
   Stocks were down at London and most other major markets.

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up
62.98 points at 29564.36. The index retreated 177.69 points
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was off 38.79 points
to 29525.57 at the close of the morning session.
   Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at
700 million shares, up from 508 million Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 492 to 441, while
177 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which fell 8.11 points Tuesday, took
back 7.42 points, or 0.34%, to 2200.51.
   The Second Section index, a 23.59-point loser Tuesday,
fell 17.43 points, or 0.49%, to close at 3508.83.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at nine million
shares, down from 10 million Tuesday.
   Some observers termed trading activity this week as a
short-term "dealers' market," with most private investors
taking a defensive stance before next week, when the market
will be closed for holidays Monday, Thursday and Friday.
   But Wednesday's market was characterized more by
rumor-backed buying in certain stocks, whose price advances
triggered small rallies within their corresponding sectors,
traders said.
   "It's a favorable sign," said one Japanese securities
trader at a U.S. investment banking concern. The fact that
investors are willing to put money into the market, despite
uncertainty about economic fundamentals, "shows that they're
trying to punt," he said.
   This "punter's market" indicates that "people are willing
to chase stocks for the time being and make some very quick
money before Golden Week," he said.
   The return of buyers into the marketplace was reflected in
Wednesday's much-healthier volume, seen as an attractive
technical factor for the market, the trader added.
   But weaker currency and bond markets are still putting a
damper on buying overall, traders agreed. As a result, the
market is expected to be sluggish and flat until the holidays
are over, according to Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager and
portfolio adviser in the research department at WestLB
Securities Pacific Ltd.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo trading at 159.25 yen
Wednesday, up from 158.95 yen in New York late Tuesday and
well above its finish of 158.15 Tuesday in Tokyo.
   Traders said that the market was focused Wednesday on
three types of rumors: new products, mergers and acquisitions
and stock splits. Stocks of construction and nonferrous metal
companies were the main sectors involved, they said.
   Corporate news stories Tuesday on new products by Suzuki
Motors and Dainippon Pharmaceutical, and by Ricoh spurred
buying of these shares Tuesday. But Dainippon Pharmaceutical
lost 60 yen (38 cents) to 2,790 yen and Ricoh fell 80 yen to
1,220 Wednesday on profit-taking.
   Shares of Suzuki Motors, in which trading was suspended
Tuesday to allow for fair trading, soared 110 Wednesday to
close at 910.
   Moreover, local news reports that Nippon Mining may have
discovered a new vein and unconfirmed rumors that the company
may be planning a project involving its 47%-owned subsidiary,
Kyodo Oil Co., boosted Nippon Mining's shares by 71 yen to
997.
   Nonferrous metal companies Sumitomo Metal Mining and
Mitsubishi Mining benefited from the interest in the sector,
traders said. Sumitomo added 60 to 1,370, while Mitsubishi
advanced 61 to 745.
   London share prices finished a touch above their intraday
lows, as sharply disappointing U.K. merchandise trade data
and extremely lackluster activity sent the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index through a major
technical support level, dealers said.
   "It doesn't look good for the market at the moment," one
trader said. "There doesn't seem to be a light at the end of
the tunnel."
   The broad-based FT-SE 100-share index closed down 16.8
points at 2143.1, breaking below the chart support of 2150.
At its lowest point, reached just minutes before the session
ended, the index was down 17 points at 2142.9. The intraday
high of 2167.6 came near midday.
   At its final tally, the narrower FT 30 share index was
down 13.7 points at 1683.5. Volume was 392.8 million shares,
compared with the 372.9 million Tuesday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2158.0, down from its close of 2187.0 Tuesday.
   Most traders were markedly bearish about the prospects for
share prices in the short term as domestic concerns mount,
highlighted by Wednesday's second worst set of trade figures.
   Britain's current account deficit widened sharply in March
to #2.18 billion ($3.56 billion) from #1.39 billion in
February, amid market expectations of a number around the
#1.3 billion-#1.4 billion range.
   With no good news in sight, traders forecast a downward
drift to the next support level, reckoned to lie between 2100
and 2110 on the FT-SE 100.
   As well as economic concerns, dealers said the market
suffered from a stock shortage, which led to extreme price
fluctuations amid low volume.
   And with Friday's end to the three-week account in sight,
investors aren't willing to commit new capital to fresh
positions, traders added.
   A dose of bearish corporate news depressed prices of
several major blue chips. Industrial conglomerate BTR was a
big loser, diving 15 pence (24 cents) to 407 pence after
Norton Co., which BTR has been pursuing with a hostile bid,
signed a merger accord with France's Compagnie de
Saint-Gobain.
   Elsewhere, Cadbury Schweppes skidded 9 1/2 to 309 on news
that the U.K.'s Monopolies and Mergers Commission would begin
an inquiry into Britain's carbonated soft-drinks industry.
   Tobacco and financial services company B.A.T, having
successfully fended off a hostile bid from Hoylake earlier
this week, added 4 to 705 after reaching agreement to sell
its U.S.-based Saks Fifth Avenue department store chain to
Investcorp, an international investment firm, for about $1.5
billion.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt, lower
in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm, and mixed in
Brussels. Milan was closed for a local holiday. South African
gold stocks closed sharply lower.
   Share prices were mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei and Manila. Sydney and Wellington were
closed.
