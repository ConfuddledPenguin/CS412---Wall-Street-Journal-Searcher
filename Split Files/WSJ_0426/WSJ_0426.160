   NEW YORK -- Underwriters for Safeway Inc., one of the
crown jewels in the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. empire,
slashed the price of a 10% stake that the supermarket giant
is offering to the public.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., the
underwriters, late yesterday priced the offering at $11.25 a
share, 22% below the midpoint of the recently estimated price
range.

   The underwriters previously were forecasting that the
Safeway shares would fetch $13 to $16 apiece. The offering
totals 10 million shares.
   Trading in the shares is expected to begin today on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SWY. A spokesman for
one of the underwriters wouldn't comment on the price
reduction.
   Safeway, an Oakland, Calif., supermarket chain, was taken
private by a KKR-sponsored corporation in 1986. Since then,
Safeway has reduced debt and considerably improved its
operating profit margins.
   Underwriters had pitched Safeway on the basis of its
rising cash flow. But potential investors apparently have
balked at valuing Safeway only on the basis of cash flow, as
distinct from earnings.
   Several said the initial price range was steep, given that
Safeway's 1990 net income has been forecast at 40 cents a
share. For 1991, net has been forecast at 85 cents a share.
(As of February, Safeway's holdings included 13.6 million
shares of Vons Cos. common stock.)
   Investors also cited the fact that, over the next five
years, cash from operations will be plowed into building
stores and remodeling old ones -- and not into reducing
Safeway's $3.1 billion in debt.
   This past summer, Safeway had envisioned a bigger offering
priced at perhaps $20 a share. However, the crash in
junk-bond prices in September and investors' disenchantment
with leveraged stocks reduced the market's appetite.
   Neither KKR nor any members of Safeway's management are
selling stock in the offering. KKR is an investment firm with
offices in New York and San Francisco.
   Since the buy-out, Safeway has sold inefficient operations
and remodeled or built from scratch more than 100 stores.
Labor costs have been cut, and warehouse and buying practices
have been computerized.
   Almost half of Safeway's 1,100 stores are so-called
superstores, with 45,000 items ranging from frozen yogurt to
pizza. Profit margins on specialty items such as Chinese
foods -- an increasingly important part of the business --
are especially high.
   Safeway's operating profit as a percentage of sales
climbed to 3.2% in 1989 from 2.3% in 1986. Sales last year
were $14.32 billion.
   Analysts generally think that more stock in Safeway may be
offered in future years, perhaps to finance acquisitions, and
to enable KKR and affiliated investors to reduce their stake.
   KKR was thought to be eager to have the current offering
come to market in order to establish a track record in the
public market for Safeway shares.
