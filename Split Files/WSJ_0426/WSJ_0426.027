   Los Angeles -- Once a leading barometer of hot Southern
California trends, the Melrose Avenue shopping strip appears
to have plummetted in recent months. Sure its sidewalks are
cleaner than in funkier days. But if one more chain clothing
store displaces a Melrose mainstay, the merchants'
association might as well enclose the walks and convert to a
shopping mall.
   A welcome exception is the recently opened Rock Store, a
purveyor of rock-and-roll memorabilia with an invitingly
pre-Reaganite management style. There are no clerks with
phony accents or custom-styled display racks here. Just two
rooms crammed with thousands of items of rock-and-roll
history.

   From posters hung so closely that they resemble a
rock-and-roll mosaic peer visages that have become symbols of
their eras, from Janis Joplin to Madonna. If an idol is
missing, you might inquire about the 20,000 additional
posters in storage -- along with at least that number of
vintage magazines and sheets of rock music. You are
encouraged to ask, for this is a highly personal place of
business, in which the proprietor is behind the counter
selling merchandise from his personal collection. In the old
days, Melrose was known for stores like this, where you could
spend half the day browsing.
   For those who want to get really close to the icons of
rock, the store carries clothing that it guarantees was worn
by performers. For $1,500, you can wrap yourself in a wildly
colored beaded jacket and slip into custom-ripped jeans worn
by Vernon Reid of the group Living Color in its recent "Cult
of Personality" video. Prices soar for outfits worn by Elton
John (green sequined suit, $8,000) or Prince (black-and-blue
jumpsuit, $10,000.) There's even an usherette's costume from
the premiere of "A Hard Day's Night" ($3,500).
   On a recent Friday evening, teen-agers crowded around
display cases containing tickets to rock concerts that
occurred before they were born. There also are about 6,000
backstage concert passes, which at the time were issued free
to employees, families and friends of band members. The most
rare pass in the collection entitled the bearer to special
entrance to a Jimi Hendrix concert at New York's Fillmore
East sometime during the mid-60s. With Mr. Hendrix and the
Fillmore having long since gone to their rewards, the pass's
value has risen to $200. Sound a bit "cher"? If a Woodstock
pass could be found, it might bring twice that amount.
   As these prices suggest, rock memorabilia isn't a bargain
-- here or at flea markets or fans' conventions such as
Beatlefest or Monkeefest. What were once cheap, or even free,
souvenirs have entered the rarefied world of "collectibles."
   As a visit to the Rock Store demonstrates, that term
comprises all manner of merchandise. A truly rabid Lou Reed
listener, for example, probably wouldn't quibble that the
singer's image on a dime postcard now fetches one dollar. But
why spend $2 on a bit of bubble gum wrapped in a miniature
Blondie album cover? Do people really go for the Duran Duran
plastic tote ($20), the Electric Light Orchestra nightlight
($25) or the jumpsuit that says Van Halen but wasn't worn by
any member of the group ($75)?
   You bet, says Paul Scharfman, the Rock Store's 40-ish
owner, who claims to have developed, through trial and error,
a keen knowledge of which rock groups' merchandise will rise
in value. As an example, he cites the Allman Brothers Band,
which despite its one-time prominence doesn't command much of
the memorabilia market. On the other hand, the Go-Gos, the
girl group whose star soared rather briefly in the early
'80s, continues to attract a strong following among what he
describes as "young, innocent, all-American males."
   Sometimes even Mr. Scharfman is surprised by the strength
of a performer's charisma. He took a gamble on several
thousand Boy George dolls that were made in Hong Kong to sell
for $10 each, but were rejected by U.S. stores. At a time
when the troubled singer has largely faded from public view,
the Rock Store recently advertised the dolls in a record
collectors' magazine. A dozen were snapped up in two weeks --
at $100 each.
   A pudgy, long-haired man with a partied-out demeanor, Mr.
Scharfman spent 15 years acquiring this collection while his
wife ran a vintage toy store on Melrose known as Chic-A-Boom.
He continues to seek out new sources, largely through making
the late-night Sunset Strip club scene and keeping up with
contacts in the record business. Often a chance meeting
yields treasure. "I once met this guy who worked for Jimi
Hendrix, so I asked, `Do you have anything from tours with
him?'" The response was a poster that is, at $1,500, the most
expensive one in the store, from a 1969 West German tour by
Mr. Hendrix.
   Mr. Scharfman's own favorite possession also is German, a
gum wrapper commemorating a 1970 concert by The Who. He
claims it could fetch $50 if he would let it go. (The gum has
long since gone.)
   Although he describes the Rock Store as "profitable beyond
our wildest dreams," the former New Yorker retains a
refreshingly laid-back attitude about the venture: He's bored
with selling and would rather spend his time acquiring.
Still, he is stuck at the Rock Store day and night, his brain
the only source of reliable inventory knowledge when a
customer asks for, say, an Ebony magazine cover story about
the Ronettes, circa 1966. (He has a copy.)
   When it is suggested that perhaps a computerized system
might give him more freedom, Mr. Scharfman looks as if he has
been insulted. "Put this," he gestures toward the cluttered
displays, "on computer?"
   Despite the long hours, he clearly is delighted that the
timing of the Rock Store's opening was, as they used to say,
right on. Mr. Scharfman decided opportunity was at hand a few
months ago, after noticing that certain groups from his era
-- especially the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, the
Doors and Jimi Hendrix -- had become classics to be
continually discovered by younger audiences. Meanwhile,
groups from the '70s and '80s, such as Kiss, with its unique
sound and makeup, had developed a cult-like following.
Nostalgia for the '50s and '60s and the potential of sales to
Hollywood prop departments also played a role in the decision
to open the store.
   Now many of his customers come back several times -- as
hooked as the store's owner on collecting rock memorabilia.
Most of them began the habit by acquiring rare albums,
progressing to other items as they came to feel more and more
passionate about a favorite band. But Mr. Scharfman himself
is an exception, having switched from comic-book collecting
to buying Beatles memorabilia without ever developing a keen
interest in acquiring rock music.
   That's the primary reason why the Rock Store has no
records or tapes for sale, although browsers are treated to
background music and videos to set the appropriate musical
mood. When the store closes at 8 p.m. however, Mr. Scharfman
switches to vintage sound tracks from movies of the '30s and
'40s. Says he, "I'm not a lover of rock and roll."
