   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said first-quarter
earnings declined 16% because of softness in the U.S.
automotive and housing markets, and one-time restructuring
charges.
   Net income fell to $615 million, or 90 cents a share, from
$736 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. The latest
period included restructuring charges of seven cents a share,
while the year-earlier quarter included a gain of five cents
a share. Sales increased 8.4% to $9.40 billion from $8.67
billion.

   Analysts said Du Pont's performance was slightly better
than the 85 cents a share they had been expecting. Some
analysts raised their 1990 earnings estimates to a range of
$3.40 to $3.70 a share, from $3.30 to $3.50 a share.
   Profit declines in the quarter for polymers, fibers and
energy were less than predicted, and there were some early
benefits from cost-cutting. But higher raw material and
energy costs, and weather-related outages, caused industrial
products earnings to be worse than expected.
   Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive, said
Du Pont began to see "signs of strengthening" in March as a
result of cost-cutting programs. "We believe we will extend
our four-year trend of steady earnings improvement and
achieve our stated goal of maintaining or exceeding 16%
return on equity through a business cycle," Mr. Woolard said.
   The company said combined sales for industrial products,
fibers, polymers and diversified businesses increased 3%,
reflecting a 4% increase in selling prices and a 1% decrease
in unit sales.
   Analyst Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said polymers were the main reason for Du Pont's
better-than-expected first quarter. After-tax profits for
polymers were $109 million, excluding one-time charges of $27
million for the planned closing of two automotive finish
plants, compared with $131 million a year ago.
   "Most people may have been looking for $50 million to $80
million from polymers," Mr. Bogner said. Fibers profits of
$168 million, compared with $173 million a year ago, were
helped by growth in specialty fibers, such as Kevlar, Lycra
and Nomex.
   "Du Pont will look better than other major chemical
companies this year due to cost-cutting and less reliance on
traditional plastics and commodity chemicals," Mr. Bogner
says. He said he raised his 1990 estimate to $3.70 a share,
from $3.50.
   However, Leslie Ravitz of Salomon Brothers says the first
quarter was "no great surprise" and he won't change his $3.50
estimate for 1990. Despite encouraging business trends, "we
think the economy will slow down during the second half due
to higher interest rates," Mr. Ravitz said.
