   AB Volvo shareholders approved the Swedish auto maker's
proposed alliance with the French auto maker Regie Nationale
des Usines Renault.
   Volvo will sell 25% of its car unit and 45% of its truck
unit to Renault, and buy commensurate holdings in Renault's
car and truck units. Also, Renault Chairman Raymond Levy was
elected to the Volvo board. And Volvo holders increased the
maximum foreign ownership to 30% of voting stock from 24%, a
prelude to Renault's buying a 10% voting interest in Volvo.

   Last December, Volvo agreed to combine its food and drug
operations with the state-controlled Swedish holding company
Procordia AB; this and the Volvo-Renault pacts call for Volvo
to make net payments of 12 billion Swedish kronor ($1.95
billion). Volvo estimated joint purchasing and development
with Renault will yield annual savings of 800 million kronor
within two years, and two billion kronor after 1995.
Meanwhile, Volvo's car unit, hurt by slipping sales, said it
plans to cut 1,500 white-collar jobs over the next three
years.
