   ST. LOUIS -- Ralph Ingersoll II's bold dream of launching
a daily newspaper here has met a quick death.
   Yesterday, the self-styled maverick of the newspaper
industry closed down the St. Louis Sun, a colorful and
combative tabloid newspaper that was launched Sept. 25 with
great fanfare.

   Unable to meet the circulation goals of the paper, which
was losing millions on home delivery, Mr. Ingersoll wasted
little time to stop the bleeding. Yesterday was the paper's
last issue. The final copy of the Sun carried the headline
"Deathly Quiet," about a local shooting.
   Mr. Ingersoll's Sun was ambitious in its very concept,
attempting to launch a new newspaper in a major city, going
head-to-head with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, owned by
Pulitzer Publishing Co.
   Chairman of the Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., Mr. Ingersoll had appointed himself editor
in chief of the Sun in October. He recently bought a home in
St. Louis, wrote spirited editorials, made decisions on
front-page stories and even personally interviewed local
bigwigs such as Carl Icahn, whose Trans World Airlines Inc.
has its hub in St. Louis.
   If the paper had worked, it would have been the first
successful launch of an independent city newspaper since
World War II. In a statement, Mr. Ingersoll said the Sun had
a budget of between $20 million and $25 million, but he had
been forced to invest even more than that.
   Industry people close to the Sun say Mr. Ingersoll's
venture cost him much more -- as much as $40 million in its
seven months of life.
   The closing of the Sun didn't affect Ingersoll
Publications' Suburban Journals, a highly profitable chain of
weekly newspapers that ring St. Louis.
   As recently as two weeks ago, Mr. Ingersoll denied
published reports that he would close down the Sun, though he
did admit the paper's home delivery was costing $5 million a
year more than expected. The Sun's daily paid circulation
never went higher than 105,000; the Post-Dispatch actually
gained circulation during the Sun's tenure, reaching 420,000
daily.
   "If the Sun had been tried by someone with deeper pockets
and without his company's debt problem, the Sun would still
be operating," said Tom Adams, media analyst for Paul Kagan
Associates. "Considering his financial situation, it's not
surprising Ralph wants to stop the bleeding."
   It's been a bad week for Mr. Ingersoll, who didn't return
phone calls for an interview. Community Newspapers Inc., one
of the newspaper holding companies jointly owned by Ingersoll
Publications and E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., is struggling to
avoid default on its heavy debt load. Another of Mr.
Ingersoll's holding companies, Ingersoll Newspapers Inc.,
made an offer last month to buy back about $240 million of
Community's junk bonds at a deep discount to their face
value. But by Monday, not a single bondholder had tendered
bonds, and Mr. Ingersoll was forced to extend the cash tender
offer to midnight May 4. Mr. Ingersoll was offering
disgruntled bondholders as little as 28 cents on the dollar
to buy back the debt.
   The St. Louis Sun is part of Mr. Ingersoll's Ingersoll
Newspapers Inc., one of his two holding companies. Mr.
Ingersoll controls a total of 18 daily newspapers and 140
nondaily newspapers.
   Industry observers are now wondering which other Ingersoll
owned or controlled newspaper properties may be sold or in
some other way affected by Mr. Ingersoll's financial crunch.
Ingersoll Publications already put up for sale Chanry
Communications, a chain of 76 free weekly newspapers on Long
Island in New York. In January, Mr. Ingersoll's two newspaper
holding companies sold 10 newspapers to raise more than $320
million, which the company said would be used to pay off
debt.
   While Mr. Ingersoll claims the closing of the Sun wasn't
based on lack of advertising support, the Sun's advertising
linage was usually never more than 20% of the paper; most
profitable newspapers run close to 60% ad linage.
   The Sun's 194 full-time employees will get full pay for 12
weeks.
   Mr. Ingersoll had thought that the Sun was a sure thing.
The Post-Dispatch, he was fond of saying, had become
complacent and lazy in its news coverage and people wanted an
alternative to its liberal editorial page. The Sun in Mr.
Ingersoll's hands was a strong civic booster, a friend of the
powers-that-be and largely conservative in its editorial
outlook.
   But it was the job of editor that Mr. Ingersoll relished
most. He had hoped the Sun would play a large part in
bringing a new professional sports arena to downtown St.
Louis and in keeping TWA in the city. He recently told a
reporter that the "Sun is not only going to report the news,
it's going to make the news." Yesterday, Mr. Ingersoll did
just that.
