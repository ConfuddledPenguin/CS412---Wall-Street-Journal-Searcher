   LONDON -- Britain's trade deficit worsened surprisingly in
March, rattling London equity markets, and stirring fears
that United Kingdom inflation is resisting the Thatcher
government's assaults.
   The British current-account gap ballooned to #2.2 billion
($3.59 billion) in March from a revised February level of
#1.4 billion. Invisible items in the trade account, which
include services and investments, were in balance. Usually,
these have been in surplus and have partly offset the
shortfall in merchandise trade.

   The pound fell sharply against the West German mark in
European trading after the announcement was made, but it held
steady against the dollar.
   In a television interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major argued that the month's dismal trade figures
shouldn't be given too much weight. He noted that a
significant portion of the increase in imports involved
one-time transactions known as "erratics," which don't carry
much economic importance. Still, he offered little hope for
companies and mortgage-holders eager for a reduction in
Britain's base interest rates, which stand at 15%. "We will
have to sit it through for a little longer," he said.
   Tim O'Dell, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
London-based securities firm, warned that an increase in
rates could be in the offing. Specifically, if trade figures
don't improve, and the Bundesbank pushes through an expected
interest-rate increase, "sterling would be under pressure and
that would tip the balance in favor of following suit," he
said.
   Britain imported #10.5 billion worth of goods in March,
7.5% higher than import levels a month earlier. For the first
quarter the value of imports was 5% higher than the previous
quarter and 11% higher than the same period a year earlier.
   Notwithstanding the role played by the so-called erratics,
the continuing import surge is stirring worries that the
government's policy of high interest rates isn't working as
fast as hoped.
   "Is this a warning that there may be a need to clamp down
further?" asked Mr. O'Dell. "It could be hard for the
government to reverse the inflation trend this side of the
election," which must be called sometime before mid-1992.
