   Brink Lindsey's March 7 editorial-page piece "Trade
Crisis? What Trade Crisis?" argues that, contrary to the
conventional wisdom, there is a world trade boom driven by
the relaxation of import barriers and characterized by the
expansion of trade between Pacific Rim countries.
   What is happening in the Pacific Rim is not, as Mr.
Lindsey contends, an illustration of the internationalization
of world trade but a clear indication that the area is
evolving into a distinct trading bloc, with Japan accounting
for about 80% of the entire East Asian gross national
product. Much of the "import surge" in Japan is owed to
exports from Japanese subsidiaries in East Asian countries.

   While the once "Newly Industrializing Countries" of East
Asia may be increasing their levels of imports from the U.S.,
the fact remains that Japan, South Korea and Taiwan now
account for nearly two-thirds of our trade deficit.
   Finally, Mr. Lindsey's piece is laced with all sorts of
impressive figures and percentages backing up his claim that
the world trading system is being liberalized. The emphasis,
however, should not be on the numbers, but on the composition
of trade between countries. There are those of us who believe
that there is a difference between Japan's imports of raw
materials or products manufactured by its offshore facilities
and its relative lack of imports involving value-added goods
produced by foreign firms.
