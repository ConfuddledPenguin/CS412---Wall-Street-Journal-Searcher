   NEW YORK -- With a surprise winning bid for Saks Fifth
Avenue, Investcorp International Inc., a low-profile
partnership of Arabian investors, is taking a big gamble on
an industry that has bankrupted other foreign investors.
   Investcorp, beating out bids from other retailers and the
store's own management, agreed to buy Saks from B.A.T
Industries PLC for about $1.5 billion.

   Though little-known outside investment banking circles,
Investcorp, whose key partners constitute a Who's Who of the
Arabian Gulf's business world, has so far succeeded where
others such as Campeau Corp. have failed. Investcorp made a
huge profit buying and selling Tiffany &amp; Co., and it also
profited handsomely from a leveraged buy-out of Peebles Inc.,
a Southeastern department-store chain.
   In total, the Bahrain financial company has completed 42
separate transactions valued at a total of more than $5
billion since it was formed in 1982 by an Iraqi banker who
quit Chase Manhattan Bank to solicit wealthy Middle Eastern
investors.
   Investcorp's success with retailing acquisitions is based
on a common-sense strategy. To avoid the crushing debt levels
typical of many buy-outs, Investcorp takes a 20% to 40%
equity stake in its deals. It buys brand names such as
Tiffany and Gucci, in which it recently took a 50% position.
And it attracts talented managers by giving them equity
stakes while maintaining a hands-off attitude.
   "We don't have the skills in-house to operate the
businesses in which we invest," says Robert Glaser, an
Investcorp partner. "We believe the right way is to be a
financial owner in partnership with management. We also
believe in providing enough equity to allow our companies to
withstand competition or any shocks to the economy."
   Investcorp's purposely low profile will be difficult to
maintain as the owner of Saks. The 46-store specialty chain
reaches from Fifth Avenue in New York to Wilshire Boulevard
in Beverly Hills and dots such Midwestern cities as
Cincinnati and Kansas City, Mo. For the year ended Dec. 31,
1989, Saks had sales of $1.3 billion and earned $111 million
before interest and taxes.
   According to people familiar with Investcorp, the company
is investing a shade more than $500 million in equity capital
and issuing another $250 million to $300 million in
subordinated debt. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. is leading
the senior financing, which is estimated at $700 million.
   Investcorp's board members play influential roles
throughout the Arabian Gulf world. Among them are Chairman
Abdul-Rahman Salim Al-Ateeqi, who has served as Kuwait's
Minister of Finance; Ahmed Ali Kanoo, chairman of the
National Bank of Bahrain; and Omar Aggad, a director of the
Saudi British Bank.
   Investcorp was started by Nemir Kirdar, an Iraqi national
who now lives in London. "Mr. Kirdar is very bright with a
strong financial background," says William Chaney, chairman
and chief executive of Tiffany &amp; Co., whose friendship with
Mr. Kirdar led to Investcorp's 1984 purchase of Tiffany for
$135 million.
   When Investcorp acquired Tiffany from Avon Products Inc.,
the venerable jeweler was losing money after a disastrous
attempt to boost sales by trying to appeal to a broader
audience. After Investcorp took over, Tiffany played down its
$10 wine glasses to concentrate on the high-priced diamonds
and gold jewelry that had made it famous. Investcorp took the
company public in 1987, earning over $100 million on its
investment.
   Mr. Kirdar was initially hired by Chase in the early 1970s
to develop business in the Middle East. Realizing that many
Middle Eastern investors were tiring of Swiss savings
accounts or U.S. Treasury notes, he opened shop in a Holiday
Inn in Bahrain, working with a list of 1,000 extremely
wealthy Middle Eastern investors. Most of his important
American associates were former Chase executives.
   Today, Investcorp is 31%-owned by management; 20 major
investors from the Middle East own another 20%; and 10,000
smaller investors in the Middle East own the remainder. The
investors generally don't play an active role in the company.
"We asked investors to put up cash, and we said we wanted to
be partners, not employees," says Mr. Glaser. "We also told
them there will be a board but that we wanted to have
operating control."
   Although Investcorp's total capitalization is $200
million, its actual buying power is much greater. Investcorp
not only has client funds under management in excess of $500
million but those clients also participate in specific deals
through private placement offerings.
   Among the competing bidders for Saks were Dillard
Department Stores Inc.; retailer Joseph Brooks and Merrill
Lynch & Co.; and General Cinema Corp. Saks Chairman and Chief
Executive Melvin Jacobs together with Tobu Department Store
Co., a large Tokyo retailer, is said to have bid $1.3
billion, the second-highest offer. Mr. Jacobs declined to
comment yesterday, but Mr. Brooks, chairman and chief
executive of Ann Taylor Inc., said: "I'm bitterly
disappointed."
   A senior Saks executive, who declined to be identified,
said: "Some people here are stunned. They wanted it very
badly. On the other hand, I'd rather have Investcorp than
another retailer who would have brought in their own team."
Investcorp, which usually holds a property for three to seven
years before reselling it, is known to be interested in
retaining Mr. Jacobs and his management group.
   Saks is strongest in the New York metropolitan area, where
it operates seven stores. However, the retailer has also
succeeded in developing strong followings in Chicago, Beverly
Hills, San Francisco and in Florida, where it operates five
units.
   "They've made all the right moves," says Howard
Davidowitz, a retail consultant. "America is getting older
and wealthier, and the Saks strategy appeals to that
customer. Saks has also built one of the best men's apparel
businesses in the country. Their biggest problem will be
going forward. There will be pressure to expand, and the
corporate culture at Saks may change."
   Some of those who have done business with Investcorp in
the past have fewer reservations.
   Mike Moorman, chairman and chief executive of Peebles,
said that nobody inside the retail chain knew what to expect
when Investcorp bought the business in October 1986 for about
$75 million. Peebles had been family-owned since 1891, and
there were concerns that the new owners would insist on major
changes and perhaps limit expansion.
   "Everybody had a certain amount of anxiety, but Investcorp
turned out to be aboveboard," says Mr. Moorman. "We went from
$88 million in sales in 1986 to about $149 million in 1989.
They put certain controls in place, but they let us grow."
Mr. Moorman, who joined the company after graduating from
college, said that Investcorp offered key managers an equity
stake in the company. Last year, when Investcorp sold the
company for $160 million, he made a handsome profit.
   Despite Investcorp's past retail successes, many in the
industry expressed shock at the $1.5 billion price Investcorp
is paying for Saks. But Mr. Glaser, the Investcorp partner,
noted that Saks owns most of the real estate on which its
stores sit, including its prestigious Fifth Avenue location.
He declined to comment on the possibility of Investcorp
selling off some of those assets, much as it sold the Tiffany
building on Fifth Avenue for about $60 million.
   "The real estate enabled a buyer to pay more than for a
Marshall Field's or a Bloomingdale's, which had similar
numbers," said Peter J. Solomon, who heads his own investment
banking firm in New York. "Still, it's a full price."
   Mr. Solomon also suggested that the Saks transaction,
coupled with Dayton Hudson Corp.'s $1 billion purchase of
Marshall Field's, another B.A.T property, significantly
raises the value of several retail chains owned by the
Federated and Allied units of Campeau Corp. "I think it's
possible that Bloomingdale's is now worth more than $1
billion," he said.
