   Stanley Stahl, an investor controlling 30.6% of Apple
Bancorp Inc. extended his $38-a-share tender offer for the
rest of the bank to May 25 from April 25.
   As of March 20, Apple had 4.6 million shares outstanding.
As of 10 a.m. EDT April 25, holders had tendered 1,157 shares
under the offer, which is valued at $121.6 million. When the
offer was announced March 28, Apple shares leaped past the
offer price, suggesting that investors expect a higher offer
for the bank.

   A spokesman for Mr. Stahl declined to comment on whether
the investor might boost his bid. Apple, based in New York,
has rejected Mr. Stahl's offer as not in the best interests
of the bank or its shareholders. The bank declined on Mr.
Stahl's extension of his offer.
