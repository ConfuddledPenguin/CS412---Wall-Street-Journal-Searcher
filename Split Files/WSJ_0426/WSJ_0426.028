   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Daimler-Benz AG said a change
in the way it calculates pension liabilities and inventories
added a one-time contribution of 5.1 billion marks ($3
billion) to 1989 group net income, which totaled 6.8 billion
marks with the extraordinary gain.
   Analysts said the balance-sheet adjustment was aimed at
making Daimler-Benz look more attractive to international
investors, who don't always account for conservative West
German accounting practices when assessing West German
balance sheets.

   When excluding the accounting adjustment, the automotive
and technology conglomerate said that the group's net income
would have been unchanged at the 1988 net income level of 1.7
billion marks, reflecting pressured earnings from automotive
operations last year. The extraordinary gain will be
allocated to equity reserves, the company said.
   The gain came on a write-back of part of Daimler-Benz's
overfunded pension provisions and undervalued inventories
accumulated over previous years. Daimler-Benz said it altered
the conservative basis on which it calculates the two
positions to better reflect international standards in time
for planned stock listings on the London and Tokyo stock
exchanges later this year.
   Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in
London estimated that the change will boost the company's
equity as a percentage of total assets to around 30% from
22%, bringing its per-share net asset value to 400 marks from
267 marks. "Basically, it will make the company look more
solid than under its old system of overprovisioning for
pensions," Mr. Reitman said. After cumulative gain for 1989
results, the analyst judged that the change to pension
valuations in the future will reduce the company's annual
labor costs by an annual 500 million marks.
