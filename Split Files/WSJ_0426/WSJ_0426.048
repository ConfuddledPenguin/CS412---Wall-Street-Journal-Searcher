   Stock prices rebounded in light trading, snapping a
five-session losing streak. But bond prices continued to
erode modestly and the dollar weakened.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.94 to 2666.44 in
thin trading. Long-term Treasury bonds lost about an eighth
of a point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount.

   Analysts said apparent firming in the bond market early in
the day got stock prices off to a good start. Later, news
that Norton had accepted a $90-a-share takeover offer from
Saint-Gobain of France provided enough confidence to keep
stock prices up after bonds began slipping.
   The modest stock market rally was welcome relief from the
drumbeat of slumping prices that carried the Dow Jones
Industrial Average down 4% in the past five sessions. But
many analysts dismissed yesterday's gains as a mere technical
rally that won't endure. They argue that investors remain
worried about the course of interest rates and inflation and
aren't likely to see stocks as the best place to put money
until it is clear that interest rates have stabilized.
   Bond traders share the pessimistic interest-rate outlook.
Although bond prices rose briefly yesterday, traders remained
worried about inflation and economic growth. They're bracing
for the initial report Friday on first-quarter gross national
product, which is expected to be at least double the 1.1%
growth posted in the fourth-quarter of 1989 and perhaps as
much as 3%. They also expect inflation data that are part of
the GNP report to show inflation rising.
   Longer term, traders are concerned that the Treasury's
quarterly refunding auction next month will put further
pressure on bond prices. And they're debating the likelihood
the Federal Reserve will push short-term interest rates
higher before the May auction. As the economy picks up steam
and inflation rises, the odds increase that the Fed will
raise rates in a bid to slow the economy and bring inflation
back under control.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in light trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 133.5 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 774 to 664.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were off. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year issue rose to 8.97%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was lower. In late New York trading, the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6785 marks and 158.75 yen compared
with 1.6980 marks and 158.93 yen Tuesday.
