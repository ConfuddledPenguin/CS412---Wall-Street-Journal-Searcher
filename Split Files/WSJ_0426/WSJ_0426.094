   NEWARK, N.J. -- Four men related to a defunct
Florida-based, penny-stock brokerage firm pleaded guilty to
federal charges here, the U.S. attorney said.
   Before U.S. District Court John W. Bissell, Ronald A.
Martini, who held a secret one-third share in Sheffield
Securities, and John LaSala, another one-third owner of the
Fort Lauderdale firm, which closed in April 1989, pleaded
guilty to federal informations in connection with a
stock-manipulation scheme. Ronald Spencer, a former
securities trader at Sheffield, pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges in connection with the same scheme.

   A third principal of Sheffield, Allen Weinstein, 53 years
old, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges related to
a scheme to conceal Mr. Martini's ownership in Sheffield from
regulators and the public.
   Messrs. Martini and LaSala admitted they helped two New
Jersey men to fraudulently raise, maintain and control
securities prices of Vista Capital Corp., Castleton Investors
Corp. and Bellatrix Corp. The scheme resulted in a loss of
more than $5 million, officials said.
   The two New Jersey men weren't charged in this case, in
which investigations are continuing.
   Mr. LaSala's attorney hadn't any comment on the case. An
attorney for Mr. Weinstein stressed that his client wasn't
charged in the stock-manipulation scheme. Lawyers for Mr.
Spencer and Mr. Martini couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Martini, 52, of Lighthouse Point, Fla., faces a
maximum of 15 years in jail and a $750,000 fine. Mr. LaSala,
43, of Pompano Beach, Fla., faces 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine. Mr. Spencer, 34, of Tampa, Fla., and Mr.
Weinstein, of Hollywood, Fla., each face five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
   Sentencing hasn't been set for the four men, who have all
agreed to cooperate with the government's probe of the
penny-stock industry.
