   CHICAGO -- Chrysler Corp.'s dismal spring sales
performance, says Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, reflects a
strategic retreat, at least in part.
   "Rightly or wrongly, we chose not to take unprofitable
business," Mr. Iacocca said. "It's that simple."

   Mr. Iacocca came to Chicago in the latest stop in his
"Chrysler in the '90s" sales-promotion tour, and he tapped a
local sports metaphor to describe his company's recent woes.
   "We're taking a beating," he said. "We're like the Cubs.
We haven't had a good spring."
   Indeed not. Chrysler's car and truck sales dropped more
than 7% in the first quarter, while industrywide sales were
virtually flat. This month is even worse: Chrysler's domestic
sales have plunged 32% so far in April, more than twice the
decline for the overall market. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Chrysler's stock closed at
$15.375, down 37.5 cents and a new 52-week low.
   What's happening? In recent months Chrysler has backed
away from many fleet sales, and also stopped building its
13-year-old Omni/Horizon models. Both moves are costing
Chrysler dearly in terms of sales, but may be starting to add
to the bottom line.
   Chrysler says it was profitable -- albeit barely -- in the
first quarter, in contrast to last year's fourth quarter,
when the company lost money. But Chrysler shipped fewer
vehicles to dealers in the first quarter than in the fourth
quarter. "So despite lower shipments, we made money instead
of lost money," says R.S. Miller Jr., executive vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Chrysler's retreat from the fleet business is ironic. Last
year the company bought Thrifty Rent-a-Car System Inc. to
guarantee a captive, high-volume fleet buyer for Chrysler
cars.
   Recently, however, Chrysler gave Thrifty approval to buy
about 4,000 cars from Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Chrysler wanted
to sell its own cars to Thrifty but couldn't match
Mitsubishi's price. Because Thrifty has to keep its rental
rates competitive, Chrysler officials decided they couldn't
order Thrifty to buy higher priced Chrysler cars.
   Chrysler's "fleet retreat" is especially hurting sales of
the Dodge Dynasty, Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance. So far
this year, sales of those three models are running 20,000
cars behind a year ago.
   As for the Omni and Horizon, Chrysler stopped building
them in February when it closed the Detroit plant where the
cars were assembled. Before closing, the factory was running
on just one shift, making the cars money losers. Sales were
slow because Chrysler hadn't redesigned the vehicles in the
13 years since their introduction.
   Chrysler will continue to sell Omni and Horizon until
supplies run out. After that, its only "entry-level" cars
will be models that it imports from Mitsubishi, such as the
Dodge Colt. But even there Chrysler is backing away from
sales.
   "Because of price levels and not enough incentives from
Mitsubishi," says Mr. Iacocca, "we chose to take 50,000 cars
out of our Japanese buy."
   Chrysler sales problems don't all stem from a strategic
retreat from money-losing business. The company's luxury car
sales are running more than 30% behind a year ago, because
many buyers are flocking to competing products.
   What's more, the company is getting clobbered in the
pickup truck market, largely at the hands of General Motors
Corp. GM has begun a slugfest to gain ground from Ford Motor
Co., and so far Chrysler seems to be the biggest casualty. So
far this year Chrysler has sold just 92,700 Dodge trucks
(excluding minivans), down 15% from a year earlier.
   How does Chrysler get out of its pickle? This fall the
company will introduce a bargain-priced version of its
Shadow/Sundance compacts, hoping to make up part of the
volume it lost by killing Omni and Horizon.
   It's a stopgap move until Chrysler can get an entirely new
subcompact. The company will develop the model itself instead
of relying on foreign partners, says Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz. The company hopes to be selling the
car by 1993 or 1994.
   In addition, Chrysler hopes that its $1.5 billion
cost-cutting program will allow it to make money on sales
that now aren't profitable. As the year goes on, say company
officials, the savings should mount.
   For now, though, it's clear that Chrysler's strategy means
an unwelcome drop in market share. "I guess in the end we
might be trading a point of share, but we'll make more
money," says Mr. Iacocca, who winds up the "Chrysler in the
'90s" tour in Los Angeles next month. "You're torn. People
say that if you take the long view, you'll take even
loss-leader business. But how much for how long."
