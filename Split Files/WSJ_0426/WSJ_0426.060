   Michael Milken's plea bargain puts a punctuation mark at
the end of the era he had come to symbolize. There will be
further details to come, and a lingering impact in the new
era, not least in arguments over who was to blame for the
Savings and Loan debacle. But with the Milken case settled,
the final act has come to its end -- perhaps suitably, an
ambiguous one.
   The felonies Mr. Milken has confessed are a far cry from a
sinister conspiracy at the heart of the junk-bond market, as
overheated imaginations once had it. Nor are Mr. Milken's
crimes the suitcases-of-cash bribes of the Boesky case. But
they are not nothing. The confession included counts that,
unlike the technicalities in the Princeton/Newport and
Freeman cases, both clearly were premeditated and clearly
wrong.

   In any text on how to cheat in securities, for example,
Case 1 would be systematic shaving of points within the
bid-asked spread. Mr. Milken confessed to doing this --
though to be sure for a purpose that seemingly would have
been legitimate if handled openly. The shaving was intended
to recoup Drexel's expenses in selling a mutual fund and was
done with the agreement of the fund's manager, though not
disclosed to shareholders or properly recorded in the books.
Whatever else, the choice of this method of moving funds from
one pocket to another certainly does show a moral obtuseness.
So does the trading of favors with Mr. Boesky confessed in
other counts.
   In many ways the intriguing question is why? After you've
made your first billion or so, you really don't have to shave
the spreads or get in bed with Ivan. How does the biggest
financier since J.P. Morgan end up confessing to shoplifting?
   Mr. Milken's critics allege, of course, that his
confession is but the tip of the iceberg. Our own view is
that his admissions are entitled to what might be called the
presumption of RICO. In a normal plea bargain, everyone
assumes the criminal was guilty of more than he confessed.
But our experience with the current spate of racketeering
charges has been rather the opposite. The combination of
draconian penalties and an ill-defined crime have tilted the
bargaining advantage vastly in favor of the prosecution.
   The original charges against Mr. Milken, remember, were
levied by a prosecutor running for mayor of New York. The
final plea does not look much like the original charges.
Pressures for settlement included, for example, an FBI visit
to Mr. Milken's 92-year-old grandfather. The dropping of
charges against Lowell Milken suggests they were filed
chiefly to coerce his brother. The unambiguous case against
Mr. Boesky was resolved with a three-year sentence on his
promise to serve up a bigger fish, Michael Milken. And to get
Mr. Milken, the government was quite willing to put Drexel
Burnham Lambert on the road to bankruptcy.
   So the government had Mr. Boesky as an informer. It had
the cooperation of Mr. Milken's brokerage firm. It had
various immunized witnesses. It had access to warehouses of
records. Instead of finding crimes and seeking the
perpetrator, as the ethical canons of prosecution require, it
set its target and searched for crimes it might charge. It
found some real crimes. But the world should note that after
investigating the man who handled more inside information
than anyone in history, prosecutors did not end up feeling
they could prove a count of the much-ballyhooed insider
trading. The shoplifting charge reflects almost as badly on
the cops as the criminal.
   In any event, those who contend that corner-cutting always
was the essence of Mr. Milken's operation face an enormous
hurdle. He leaves behind so many still-enthusiastic clients
that this scarcely seems a serious possibility. Most
junk-bond revenue went not to the takeover wars but to
finance some of the most entrepreneurial companies in
America. Some of these companies are of course troubled, as
some risk-taking companies always will be. Yet risk taking
also is the spark plug of economic progress.
   We now are in our eighth year of economic expansion, a
peacetime record. Over this time, the large established
companies have been paring back jobs, in part because of the
need for efficiency spurred by the threat of both foreign
competition and takeovers. But at the same time, the American
economy has enjoyed a net job creation that is the envy of
other nations. The expansion we have enjoyed was due in part
to the opening of new financing mechanisms for smaller and
riskier companies.
   Many good things, of course, get carried too far. Mr.
Milken's original insight was that the premium on
noninvestment-grade bonds more than compensated for the risk.
Over time markets would close this anomaly, and inevitably
bad risks were underwritten. Mr. Milken's $500 million in
compensation, as well as $1 million incomes for 29-year-old
investment bankers, invited envy, suspicion and in general
signaled something amiss. The use of junk bonds to finance
takeover attempts made enemies of corporate chieftains. And
while the advent of takeovers put sleepy managements on their
toes, at the end of the wave came ego trips like RJR-Nabisco
and losers-from-the-start like Campeau.
   Big waves often crest thunderously. Just as the junk-bond
market topped out, Congress moved to legislate a fire sale of
Savings and Loan holdings, plunging the junk-bond market to
unfathomed depths. Probably politicians now will blame Mr.
Milken for this debacle, indeed for the whole S&amp;L problem.
(Laying aside the contributions of Jim Wright and the Keating
Five, it actually was started by Fernand St Germain's
midnight expansion of deposit insurance, which proved to be a
formula for matching marginal lenders with marginal
borrowers.) The corporate chieftains cheered the collapse of
junk bonds and have largely succeeded in erecting nearly
impenetrable legal bastions against takeovers. Wall Street is
in depression and Drexel in bankruptcy. Clearly the era was
over, and the Milken plea only the final period.
   The new era, still defining itself, will be quite
different. Mr. Milken will have a long vacation at Lompoc.
The Justice Department has thrown a lasso around RICO
charges. Rudy Giuliani's successor as U.S. attorney, he
explictly promises, will not run for mayor. Hollywood
novelist Ben Stein, whose "Ludes" neatly recorded the end of
an earlier era, will make a movie of the Milken potboiler
he's been serializing in public prints. Wall Street gradually
will recover, but the million-dollar youths will not return.
After the S&amp;L washout, junk bonds will prove permanent though
chastened. Takeovers will nearly vanish. High leverage will
be unfashionable; the new danger is more likely to be overly
tight credit standards.
   Envy and suspicion of unchecked power will have to find
new targets. Our guess is that the corporate chieftains had
better stop to think. Now even more insulated from
shareholders, they had better be prepared to explain to whom
they're accountable. Otherwise they may end up accountable to
John Dingell. The first warning sign: General Motors received
(though politely rebuffed) letters from California and New
York state pension funds inquiring about its procedures for
selecting a successor to Roger Smith.
   That is for another day, we suppose. Today we mark the
passing of the 1980s. It was a heady time; Michael Milken
undone by Rudy Giuliani, recorded by Tom Wolfe. For a
blinding moment Mr. Milken was Master of the Universe, able
to create companies, move markets, guide the republic and
indeed the world into a bright entrepreneurial future. And
why, he apparently felt, should the Master worry about a few
eighths of a point, or about keeping the books honest, or
about the manners or ethics of a near-Master?
   By now, both the good and the bad of this time have
passed. So perhaps it's well that Mike Milken decided to cop
a plea and put it all behind him, and behind the rest of us.
