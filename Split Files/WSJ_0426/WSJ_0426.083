   WASHINGTON -- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill that
would give federal regulators the power to revoke a bank's
charter or withdraw its deposit insurance if the bank and its
directors or officers are convicted of money laundering.
   The bill, which also applies to savings and loan
associations and credit unions, passed by a vote of 406-0.
The legislation is aimed at battling what law enforcement
officials say is vastly increased money laundering from the
illegal drug trade.

   "In plain language, the provisions hold out the death
penalty for the management and for any financial institution
itself convicted of money laundering," said Rep. Frank
Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Banking
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision,
Regulation and Insurance.
   Under the legislation, regulators also could take control
of an institution if it alone -- not its management -- is
convicted of money laundering. Regulators would be required
to hold a hearing and consider how involved the bank's senior
management was in money laundering before taking the action.
This procedure would enable regulators to replace management
and make other changes without eliminating stockholders'
ownership of the institution.
   The bill is likely to become law by the end of the year. A
similar measure has bipartisan support in the Senate Banking
Committee. The banking industry favors the legislation and a
spokesman for the Treasury Department said the department
"strongly supports" the bill.
   Treasury and the banking industry joined in opposition to
a proposed amendment from Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.)
that would have required banks to maintain records on
international wire transfers if the Treasury certifies the
records are useful. Law enforcement authorities have pointed
to wire transfers as a key tool that illegal drug businesses
use to move money out of the country. Opponents argued the
provision would be burdensome to banks and noted the Treasury
is currently working on new regulations for wire transfers.
The amendment was rejected 283-127.
   However, the House approved on a voice vote an amendment
offered by Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.) directing the
Treasury to consider whether removing $50 and $100 bills from
circulation would hurt the illegal drug trade.
   One member of the House, Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.) voted
"present" on the legislation. Mr. Cooper said he "owns a lot
of bank stock" from a family inheritance and chooses not to
vote on banking legislation.
