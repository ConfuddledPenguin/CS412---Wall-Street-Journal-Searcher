   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- First Federal Savings &amp; Loan

   James D. Shelton, president and chief executive officer of
First Federal, said, "The board will undertake efforts to
initiate the shareholders' petition and to continue to
investigate other ways of maximizing shareholder value."
   "Our earnings, asset quality and capital position are well
above Connecticut regional and national averages which, we
believe, make the institution a very valuable investment
whether it remains independent or is sold," Mr. Shelton said.
