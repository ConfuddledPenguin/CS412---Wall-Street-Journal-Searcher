   Merger interest among financial and insurance stocks
helped fuel gains in those issues and staunch a six-day
losing streak in the over-the-counter market.
   The Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.37 at 420.56, a
0.3% gain. Trading remained light at 121.7 million shares,
down from 16.7 million Tuesday. Reversing a six-day trend,
advancing issues edged out declining stocks, 995 to 829.

   First Bancorp of Troy, N.C., rose 3 to 18 on heavy volume
after announcing late Tuesday that it received a merger
proposal from CCB Financial, based in Durham, N.C. CCB closed
up 1/2 at 35. CCB plans to exchange $20 in value of CCB
shares for each share of First Bancorp.
   Among thrifts, shares of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan rose
1 1/8 to 6 1/2 after its shareholders voted to seek a buyer
for the East Hartford, Conn., concern. And DS Bancor issues
gained 7/8 to 11 1/8 after the board of the Derby, Conn.,
thrift approved a buy-back of up to 10% of its common shares,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The
Nasdaq financial index, which tracks thrifts, rose 1.01 to
447.34.
   The Nasdaq insurance index rose 2.05 to 478.25, a 0.4%
gain. The Wall Street Journal had reported that a large
French insurance company, in the wake of its failed bid for
Farmers Group, said six U.S. insurance companies were
attractive merger candidates. The company, Axa-Midi
Assurances, didn't name the candidates.
   Shares of a few computer companies rose in advance of one
of the technology industry's largest gatherings of investors,
the Hambrecht &amp; Quist conference beginning Monday in San
Francisco, traders said. Legent climbed 1 1/4 to 20 1/2 and
Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer rose 3/4 to 28 1/2. Both
companies are scheduled to make presentations on Monday.
Cadence Design Systems, scheduled to appear Tuesday, gained 1
to 22 1/8.
   OTC investors remained cautious, according to traders.
"The big thing these days is to try and avoid any of the
disasters we've had recently," said Ralph Costanza, head of
OTC trading for Smith Barney. Referring to sharp drops in
stocks with disappointing earnings or earnings outlooks, Mr.
Costanza said, "Everybody wants to avoid being caught in a
trap. Conservatism is in the fore right now."
   As expected, shares of Chips &amp; Technologies were among the
day's most active, falling 3/4 to 16 on 1.4 million shares.
The San Jose, Calif., maker of microcomputer chips reported
late Tuesday that net income plunged in its fiscal third
quarter ended March 31.
   Also off following an earnings report was Applied
Bioscience, down 1 1/8 to 27 1/8. The East Millstone, N.J.,
maker of biochemical research instruments reported net income
for the third quarter ended March 31 of 41 cents a share
versus 34 cents a year earlier.
   Shares of MIPS Computer fell 3/4 to 19 3/4 after the
company reported first-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 14 cents a share versus seven cents a year
earlier. Traders said several analysts told their clients
this morning they were disappointed with the numbers.
   Piper Jaffray fell 2 1/2 to 19 after the Minneapolis-based
brokerage firm reported that earnings for the second quarter
were 52 cents a share, down from 65 cents a year earlier.
   On the upside, shares of Margo Nursery Farms gained 3/8 to
2 3/4 after the Miami concern reported first-quarter net
income of 26 cents a share, more than three times the
year-earlier net income of eight cents a share.
