   Friday, April 27, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "The Orchestra." Zbig
Rybczynski is a Polish video artist whose work has been shown
at the Museum of Modern Art and on MTV. Does this make him
the right person to make six "classical music videos" for
"Great Performances"? Tune in and see.

   Friday, April 27, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Czeslaw Milosz:
The Poet Remembers." Take "The Captive Mind," a famously
trenchant critique of totalitarianism, add a lifetime of
poems, fiction and essays written under the Nazis, under the
Soviets and in exile, and you have the remarkable career in
letters sketched in this film.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "The Story of the
Beach Boys: Summer Dreams." It seems devilishly hard for TV
to re-create the mood of the 1960s, so it's all the more
striking when this nicely acted saga of one of the decade's
best-known bands actually succeeds.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Caroline?" A
beautiful woman (Stephanie Zimbalist) shows up on the
doorstep of a rich family, claiming to be their long-lost
daughter. Is she real, or is she a gold digger? Pamela Reed,
George Grizzard, Patricia Neal and Dorothy McGuire co-star in
this "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation.
                                                                                                       

   Mondays, April 30-May 21, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Inside
Gorbachev's U.S.S.R." Hedrick Smith is the host of this
four-part series looking at the hopes and fears stirred up by
glasnost and perestroika -- to say nothing of burgeoning
nationalism (more in Monday's column).
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, May 1, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Other People's
Money." Public TV's "Frontline" already was following the
story of Charles Keating Jr. last October, when the House
Banking Committee began holding hearings on his crumbling
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. Naturally, the producer, Marion
Goldin (formerly of "60 Minutes"), persisted. This film
presents all the muck she managed to rake.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, May 2, 9-10:45 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Eat a Bowl of
Tea." This 1989 feature film -- produced and directed by
Wayne Wang, and based on a 1961 novel by Louis Chu -- is one
of the best entries in this year's "American Playhouse." It
is set in New York's Chinatown in 1949, shortly after the
repeal of the "exclusion laws" prohibiting the entry of
Chinese women into the U.S. When a young Chinese-American
introduces a Chinese wife into the aging, depressed "bachelor
society" of the older generation, the results are as poignant
as they are hilarious.
                                                                                                       

   Thursdays, May 3-June 7, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Inspector
Morse." In three new two-part mysteries, John Thaw returns as
the Oxford police inspector who (to paraphrase James Joyce)
is a poet among policemen and a policeman among poets. The
bad news is that the first film contains a lot of contrived
camera work that adds nothing but a distracting artiness. The
good news is that the second two films were made by steadier
hands.
                                                                                                       

   Friday, May 4, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Richard Nixon
Reflects: An American Interests Special." In conjunction with
the recent publication of his new book, "In the Arena: A
Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal," and the imminent
opening of the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif., former President Richard M. Nixon appears in an
extended interview with Morton Kondracke, host of Blackwell
Corp.'s regular series, "American Interests."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, May 6, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Burning Bridges."
"Emotional honesty" was the slogan back in the liberated
1960s. But is it really wise to reveal one's true feelings to
everyone in one's life? To judge from this TV movie starring
Meredith Baxter-Birney and Nick Mancuso, the answer is an
emphatic "no."
                                                                                                       

   Mondays, May 7-June 4, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Skyscraper."
First, consider that some architects are now dreaming of
500-story-high buildings. Then relax and enjoy this series
about the design, politics and construction of the downright
puny (47-story) Worldwide Plaza in midtown Manhattan.
