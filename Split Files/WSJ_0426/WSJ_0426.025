   NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp.'s direct marketing subsidiary,
Fingerhut Cos., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday after a public offering of six million shares.
   Proceeds of the offering, at $16.50 a share, will be about
$93 million, after expenses, excluding the underwriters'
overallotment option of an additional 900,000 shares. After
the offering is completed, and excluding the overallotment,
Primerica will own 72.4% of Fingerhut common outstanding.

   Fingerhut, based in Minneapolis, is a catalog retailer and
the U.S.'s fourth-largest direct mail marketer in sales. In
1989, Fingerhut earned $39.4 million on revenue of $1.1
billion.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Fingerhut
shares closed unchanged at $16.50. Primerica closed at
$28.625, up 62.5 cents.
   Separately, Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Primerica, an
insurance, consumer-credit and financial-services company,
said after the company's annual meeting that he plans to
expand the sales force of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. unit internally rather than through acquisition. The
company has said it wants to increase Smith Barney's sales
force about 50% in the next three to five years, from about
2,500 currently.
   Earlier this year, Mr. Weill was in talks with American
Express Co. about a possible merger of that company's
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. securities unit with
Smith Barney. In response to a question, Mr. Weill said,
"Shearson was a unique situation. We were approached and we
spoke to them." Mr. Weill said "we could have injected a
level of management" to help the financial situation at
Shearson, and "we felt we had an obligation to our
shareholders to look at it."
   But American Express decided to buy back the remaining
approximately 30% publicly held shares of Shearson, which
last week reported a first-quarter loss of $915 million, or
$10.54 a share.
   Mr. Weill declined to make any earnings predictions.
Primerica last week posted a 62% jump in first-quarter net
income, to $83.2 million, or 73 cents a share.
   In related news, Primerica said Joseph R. Wright Jr. was
elected to its board. Mr. Wright, vice chairman and a
director of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., succeeds William S. Woodside, a
former chairman of Primerica, who retired from the board. Mr.
Woodside was named director emeritus.
