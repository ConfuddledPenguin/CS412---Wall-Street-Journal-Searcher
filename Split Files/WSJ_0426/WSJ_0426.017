   Sidney Lumet's new picture, "Q&amp;A," means to make a case
against racism. But this unwieldy dissertation on the subject
of ethnic hatred is far more convincing on the subject of
nepotism.
   Mr. Lumet's estimation of his daughter's talents are far
more generous than anyone else's might be. This fatherly
pride would be rather sweet and not embarrassing at all if
Mr. Lumet weren't a celebrated director and his daughter
Jenny weren't an aspiring actress. They are, however, and
there she is, playing a secondary but pivotal role that would
be beyond her range even if it were written well.

   This kind of misjudgment about things Mr. Lumet cares for
runs throughout "Q&amp;A." This is yet another variation on a
subject he has revisited many times -- with some memorable
results -- over the years: the good man struggling to do
right in a world that is either corrupt or indifferent or
both. This character never succeeds completely and often is
driven mad, or to his death.
   Mr. Lumet's preoccupation with this theme has resulted in
fine movies, such as "Serpico," "Dog Day Afternoon,"
"Network," "The Verdict." But in recent years, the searching
and the anger in his films has rung hollow, as though Mr.
Lumet isn't really burning with passion at injustice anymore
but feels he should be. So even though his movies continue to
have great moments -- the man attracts top actors and he
knows how to use them -- the stories don't hold. Look, for
example, at the confusion and slackness in "Running on
Empty," "Power," "Family Business."
   The inspiration for this latest movie, according to Mr.
Lumet, were the questions that lay behind "Q&amp;A," a novel of
police corruption written by Edwin Torres, who was one of the
first Hispanic judges in the New York judicial system. Mr.
Lumet has said he wanted to know: "Are the ethnic loyalties a
positive or destructive force? Does the racism have anything
to do with the mutual protection of cops and assistant
district attorneys? Is it possible that we have lived with
racism for so long that we don't see it anymore? If so, how
do we discover our own true racial feelings?"
   These are big and important questions, which Mr. Lumet --
writing his own screenplay -- has boiled down to their
simplest form: the cliche. He confronts racial tension by
having all his characters talk about their ethnicity all the
time, in the most vulgar terms. No one says "Good morning"
without referring to race or religion. "I'll translate for
your mick ears," the philosophical Jewish lawyer says to his
young Irish protege. These two, representing the good Jew and
the good Irishman, are "balanced" by a shyster hook-nosed
Jewish lawyer and a vicious swaggering Irish cop.
   Most of the dialogue is packed with ugly ethnic slurs,
presumably meant to demonstrate how such language has become
part of everyday discourse. But the rhythms seem all wrong,
almost comical, like a Hungarian trying to talk American
jive. Mr. Lumet doesn't come off as a closet racist, exactly,
just a mixed-up liberal.
   The good man in this movie is a young district attorney,
Al Reilly (Timothy Hutton), who has been selected by his
ambitious superior, also Irish, to investigate a murder. The
victim was a hood; the killer was a legendary policeman, yet
another Irishman named Mike Brennan (Nick Nolte). Soon the
fledgling D.A. learns what the audience knows from the
outset, that the murder wasn't "justifiable homicide."
Brennan is a brutal man who knows no rules. Reilly has been
picked to handle the case because he's innocent and he's
Irish and, as he's told repeatedly throughout the film,
"There's not many of us left in this city."
   Reilly's investigation turns up many unsavory characters,
all marked by the distinctive ethnic characteristics stamped
out by Hollywood. There's the Italian mobster, the noble
black cop, the Puerto Rican drug lord. If Mr. Lumet cares so
deeply about divisive sterotypes, why has he stocked his film
with nothing but?
   Brennan, who is a superhuman baddie, manages to be
everywhere all the time in the metropolis, doing damage to
those who might rat on him. There is some enjoyment in
watching Nolte's relentlessly vicious Brennan. The actor
hulked himself up for the part and squeezed out any sign of
humanity in the process. He's scary, like a bull who's been
stuck one time too many. You don't want to be in his path.
   Mr. Lumet goes most wildly off track with the movie's only
female character, the young woman, Nancy, played by his
daughter Jenny. She once loved young Reilly, but left him
when he appeared shocked at seeing her father for the first
time and discovering he was black. Was the shock an
expression of racism, or surprise that she hadn't mentioned
this fact to the man she was going to marry, after two years
of dating?
   They meet each other again six years later, when Reilly
has called in an underworld figure for questioning who, as it
turns out, is Nancy's new boyfriend.
   He is Bobby Texador, a very successful Hispanic drug
dealer whom Mr. Lumet inexplicably has chosen to portray as
one of the few decent men in the movie. Are we to believe
that everyone in the established structure is evil or too
worn down to care, but that in the netherworld of hard-core
crime a leading figure is just a sweet guy at heart who wants
to marry his honey and get away from it all? Armand Assante's
Bobby is very good -- too good, in fact to be believed.
   Is it a sign of Mr. Lumet's own unexamined racial feelings
that Nancy's response to breaking up with her white boyfriend
was to quit school and turn first to drugs, then to a drug
kingpin? His fascination with the subject undoubtedly runs
deeper than what he's done with it here, since one of his own
four marriages -- the marriage that produced Jenny -- was to
a woman of color, Lena Horne's daughter.
   "Q&amp;A" seems breathless, as though Mr. Lumet were in such a
hurry to get it made he didn't figure out the questions, much
less the answers.

   Video Tip: Sidney Lumet has the power to make a mess like
"Q&amp;A" because he has made so many first-rate films, most of
which are available on video. However, seeing Armand Assante
reminded me of an obscure but dandy little film by Glen Pitre
called "Belizaire the Cajun." Mr. Assante is wonderful in
this offbeat period piece about life in the Louisiana bayou,
circa 1850, and so is Michael Doucet's zydeco-inspired score.
