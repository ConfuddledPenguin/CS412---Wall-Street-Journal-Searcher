   NEW YORK -- Platinum prices fell to a two-year low,
pulling down silver and gold as increased selling of bullion
triggered heavy liquidation in precious metals futures.
   July delivery platinum ended with a loss of $15.60 an
ounce at $472.20. At one point, July traded at a new
life-of-contract low of $465, for a decline of $22.80. That
was the lowest price since the April 1988 contract traded at
$462.00 on March 3, 1988.

   Silver was also weak, with the May contract settling at
$4.9220 an ounce, for a loss of 7.8 cents. The May contract
traded at a new low of $4.89 before recovering slightly. June
gold was down $5.40 an ounce at $373.60.
   "Producers so far have been very disciplined in their
selling, but some 10 days ago it became evident that the
Soviet Union was beginning to sell gold and platinum more
aggressively to earn foreign exchange," said William O'Neill,
research director for Elders Futures in New York.
   Yesterday, the Soviet Union increased its selling of gold
and platinum, and South Africa also may have been a seller of
both metals, Mr. O'Neill said. South Africa is the world's
leading gold and platinum producer; the Soviet Union is
second.
   The chain of events that took place, he said, started with
the producer selling. "Dealers then joined in and when the
futures markets opened, commodity funds heavily liquidated
futures contracts," he said. "When July platinum broke below
$475, the price quickly dropped to its low of $465 as
stop-loss selling orders were touched off," he said.
   "The impact of the Soviet sales was more pronounced on
platinum than on gold because platinum is a very thin market
that is susceptible to wide price swings on major
developments," Mr. O'Neill said. Yesterday, gold also had
some support that minimized declines because the dollar was
down against a very strong Swiss franc and West German mark,
he said.
   The Soviet Union sold gold and platinum because its
economy is "disastrous and starved for foreign exchange, in
part due to the recent drop in oil prices, which reduced
export income," according to Mr. O'Neill. "The only economic
weapon they have is the sale of precious metals. Precious
metals prices have been weak, but their need to sell may have
been so strong that they have decided to sell now before
prices fell further," he said.
   A lack of demand for gold and platinum from all areas of
the world, particularly the Middle East and the Far East,
caused the market to be particularly vulnerable to the
selling, also, Mr. O'Neill said.
   An added weight on precious metals has been created by the
sharp drop in bond prices and the consequent rise in interest
rates to almost 9%, according to Mr. O'Neill.
   He explained that "if a trader bought gold at $400 an
ounce while interest rates were at 9%, gold would have to
rise to $436 to equal what he would have made with a bond.
There's little chance gold will do that now. This tends to
scare traders away from precious metals."
   Vahid Fathi, analyst for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in
Cleveland, said Lithuania might have been a factor in the
market.
   "Rumors of Soviet selling depressed the market," Mr. Fathi
said, "and I'm not surprised if they've stepped up their
selling of gold and platinum lately. Lithuania recently said
that it might have to sell gold to get foreign exchange to
pay for energy that it was going to get from other countries
after the Soviet Union shut down supplies. However, all these
developments remain just rumors because everything is so hard
to confirm."
   J. Clarence Morrison, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities, commented: "There may have been Soviet selling of
gold and platinum but I would say it wasn't exclusively so.
During the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of
this year, gold was under the pressure of central bank
selling from around the world and there was the possibility
there would be further selling in the second quarter."
   London dealers said that an announcement by Rustenburg
Platinum Holdings Ltd. of South Africa that it would increase
its production of platinum may have been a price-depressing
factor. The company didn't say how much extra production
there would be but dealers estimated that it would amount to
an additional 150,000 ounces, which would bring the company's
annual output to 1.4 million ounces. South Africa produces
about 2.5 million ounces annually. The report didn't have
much impact in London, but apparently it did in New York, the
dealers said.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: The April futures contract, which will cease
trading today, soared 10 cents a pound to $1.3400 on concern
that Commodity Exchange supplies might not be adequate to
satisfy outstanding April contracts. However, while there
recently was a wide disparity between the number of
outstanding April contracts and exchange inventories, the gap
narrowed significantly yesterday, though it didn't disappear.
The number of April contracts declined to 836, or the
equivalent of 10,450 tons, from 913, or 11,412 tons, on
Tuesday, while exchange supplies rose 1,975 tons from the day
before to 6,004 tons. Robert McGrath, Comex spokesman, said:
"We're keeping an eye on the situation and expect an orderly
liquidation of the April contract." Late Tuesday, the
exchange increased the requirement to purchase an April
copper contract to 100% of its price. Even so, the April
contract's sharp rise widened its premium over the May
delivery by 5.50 cents to 14.00 cents, as the May contract
closed at $1.20 a pound for a gain of 4.50 cents. Separately,
it was reported that the strike at Southern Peru Copper Co.
might be nearing an end, analysts said. Workers may be back
by early May, according to one analyst. A ship carrying 5,000
tons to 10,000 tons of refined copper was having trouble in
the Panama Canal and may not be able to meet its scheduled
arrival in mid-May in Rotterdam, one analyst said. A Chilean
official said nothing has happened to disrupt Codelco's
shipping operations and keep it from fulfilling its May
delivery commitments, the analyst said. Codelco is the
state-owned mining company. The analyst quoted an official as
saying existing production problems have already been
incorporated in its annual production estimate, which was
lowered Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose following an increase in the
U.S. sugar import quota. The May contract advanced 0.37 cent
a pound to 15.77 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department
yesterday raised the domestic quota by 250,000 tons to
2,830,000 tons for the period that began Jan. 1, 1989, and
extends to Sept. 30. The surprise wasn't that the quota was
raised, but that the action was taken so soon, said Judith
Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New York. "Only a couple of
weeks ago the department denied a request from the Sweetener
Users Association, an industry group, for an increase in the
quota," Ms. Ganes said. At that time it was expected that the
quota might not be increased for another month or two, she
said. The government's action boosted world market prices
because it came at a time when global sugar supplies are
tight, Ms. Ganes said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum prices declined in futures trading as
some bearish fundamental factors took attention off next
week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, if only briefly. One negative factor was the
American Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report on U.S.
oil statistics. Released late Tuesday after trading had
closed, it showed an increase in crude oil inventories. That
added to worries about the world oil glut and helped drive
down futures prices of crude. West Texas Intermediate for
June delivery fell 34 cents a barrel to settle at $18.66.
July crude was down 30 cents to $19.17. Also unsettling to
oil markets yesterday was a sharp fall in gasoline futures
prices. The May contract for unleaded gasoline was down 1.79
cents a gallon to 62.6 cents. Traders were surprised at the
drop in view of gasoline's recent strength. Some called the
gasoline declines a technical correction.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contracts
soared late in the trading session at the Chicago Board of
Trade. The Soviet Union was rumored to be interested in
buying as much as 400,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal
but the strong price rise surprised some analysts. Soybean
prices had dropped Tuesday amid profit-taking after rising
for a few weeks. One factor in the price rebound yesterday
were forecasts for good planting weather. For most crops,
such forecasts increase the prospects for strong harvests and
thus tend to weigh down prices. But warm weather and normal
rainfall this time of year in the Midwest sometimes reduces
the amount of land planted to soybeans. If rain and cold
weather delay the planting of corn until May, which is what
happened last year, many farmers are forced to plant soybeans
instead, said Richard A. Loewy, president of AgResource Co.,
Chicago. Soybean prices have been supported in recent weeks
by strong domestic demand for the oil and meal that is
derived by crushing soybeans. Soybean meal is primarily used
as an ingredient in livestock rations. Demand for soybean
oil, which is used in cooking, has been strong in part
because consumers are growing more concerned about using
imported tropical oils.
