   A Blood-Sugar Test
   Without Drawing Blood

   FIBER OPTICS could provide a means to measure a person's
blood-sugar level without drawing blood, University of
Connecticut scientists say.
   Such a non-invasive method would simplify the lives of the
nation's 10 million diabetics who must routinely check their
blood sugar, or glucose, by pricking a finger in order to
determine the doses for their insulin injections. The system
would also improve the performance of small pumps worn by
some diabetics that automatically inject insulin.
   The Storrs, Conn., scientists are basing their study on
the way glucose rotates the polarization of light waves. With
optical fibers, they beam light at blood and then read the
resulting shift in the light's polarization. "The theory
definitely works," says Martin Fox, an electrical and systems
engineering professor who is co-developing the sensor.
   The team is considering a system that would beam light
into the eye, where there is fluid containing glucose at
about the same levels present in the bloodstream, Prof. Fox
says. Patients using automatic insulin injection devices
might wear special glasses equipped with tiny optical fibers
aiming an invisible light into an eyeball. The optical fibers
could connect to a small sensor located in the glasses or
elsewhere.
   "The thing we like about {the eye} is that it's a window
into the body," Prof. Fox says.
                                                                                                       

   Fish `Hearing' Opens
   Military, Medical World
                                                                                                       

   RESEARCH into how fish hear may improve submarines'
ability to listen quietly for enemies and may help doctors
diagnose disease.
   As part of a Navy-backed study, engineers at Georgia
Institute of Technology in Atlanta are measuring
sound-induced vibrations produced by various parts of
goldfish, including the inner ear and swim bladder, a
gas-filled sac that regulates buoyancy.
   To monitor a fish's physical responses to sound, the
scientists developed and patented a non-invasive
vibration-measuring device they believe could be adapted to
check people for diseased tissue, kidney stones or glaucoma.
   Fish use a passive listening system that doesn't alert
predators or prey to their presence. This interests the Navy,
because submarines often rely on sonar to locate enemies, and
adversaries can hear those sound pulses as they bounce
through the sea.
   To observe a fish's internal responses to sound, the
researchers suspend an anesthetized goldfish in a 50 gallon
water tank. On one side of the fish, a projector broadcasts a
continuous sound wave. On the other side, a transducer aims
an ultrasonic beam into the fish, and a second transducer
receives a beam that has been modified by the sound-induced
vibrations occurring inside the fish. This system enables the
researchers to measure atomic-scale vibrations inside the
fish.
   A fish is primarily fluid, and its body may rock gently as
sound waves pass through it. Scientists suspect fish may
sense sound when the otolith, a stone-like anchor in the
inner ear, interacts with the fish's swaying body,
stimulating hair cells that send electrical signals to the
brain. The swim bladder is also believed to be involved in
creating vibrations in a fish's inner ear.
                                                                                                       

   Shielding Hospital Staff
   From Dangerous Cuts
                                                                                                       

   BECAUSE OF concern about the spread of infectious diseases
to health-care workers, new devices are being developed to
help protect them from accidental needle pricks and scalpel
cuts. Such accidents bring medical personnel in contact with
patients' blood and can expose them to infections, including
hepatitis and AIDS.
   Syringe Scabbard Systems of Lyndhurst, Ohio, is marketing
a table-mounted device resembling a fountain-pen holder in
which needles can be recapped using only one hand. It was
invented by a dentist.
   Another device, called the Recapper, is also meant to help
workers safely recap hypodermic needles. Made by On-Gard
Systems Inc. of Denver, the Recapper resembles the handle of
a sword with a shield to protect the hand grip. A hole in the
center of the shield grips a needle that is sheathed but that
is otherwise ordinary and retains the sheath as the syringe
is pulled away, exposing the needle.
   To recap the needle, the hypodermic is reinserted into its
sheath, still held by the plastic device as the hand guard
protects against pricks. The syringe and recovered needle are
removed from the Recapper, for disposal, while squeezing its
grip.
   On-Gard says more than 600 of the nation's 6,000 hospitals
have ordered Recappers for trial and that 1,000 of the
100,000 dental offices in the U.S. have done so, too. The
devices can be used over and over.
   Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., has designed a
cut-resistant glove liner to be worn under surgical gloves.
The liners are made of Allied's Spectra polyethylene fiber,
which is also used in bullet-proof vests. At $40 a pair, the
liners offer 17 times more protection than heavy leather
gloves and yet allow the wearer to take a pulse or pick up a
dime.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   WHITE BREAD packaged in carbon dioxide-filled plastic bags
keeps its fresh texture for at least a week, while loaves in
air-filled bags lose their fresh feel after a day or two,
says a report in the Journal of Food Science. . . . A tick
decoy, patented by an Old Dominion University professor,
lures males with a female's sexual odors, then kills with
poison as the male tries to mate with the bait. The inventor
plans to sell the traps for use on livestock.
