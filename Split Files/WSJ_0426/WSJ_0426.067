   CLEVELAND -- Ameritrust Corp. had a loss of $51.6 million
in the first quarter, as the bank holding company took a huge
provision to comply with tougher regulatory standards. In the
year-ago first quarter, Ameritrust earned $27.8 million, or
76 cents a share.
   In the quarter just ended, Ameritrust increased its
loan-loss provision by $120 million after federal examiners
reviewed the company's loan portfolio. Ameritrust said
examiners expressed concern over the company's commercial
real-estate loans and highly leveraged transactions. The
bank's nonperforming assets increased to $240.8 million from
$214.3 million at the end of 1989.
