   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said that Craig Fields, who was
ousted recently as head of the Defense Advanced Projects
Agency (Darpa) in a battle over industrial policy, has
decided to accept a transfer to another Pentagon job.
   But a colleague said that the Pentagon technologist
planned to take the new job only temporarily while lining up
work in private industry. Mr. Fields declined to comment.

   A Pentagon spokesman said that Mr. Fields would start May
7 as deputy director of defense research and engineering,
with responsibility for streamlining the Pentagon's
laboratories. Victor Reis, Darpa's deputy director, will
succeed Mr. Fields as acting administrator.
   Mr. Fields was pressured into accepting the transfer,
widely viewed as a demotion, Pentagon and congressional
officials said, because he had pushed the government to
aggressively invest in companies pursuing commercial
technology.
   On Tuesday, a group of 11 lawmakers, including House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, called for Mr. Fields's
reinstatement, arguing that he is one of the government's
most successful technology leaders. But a colleague of Mr.
Fields said that the Pentagon technologist doubted the
Defense Department would reverse its decision.
   Last Friday, the Pentagon delivered an ultimatum to Mr.
Fields to resign, accept the transfer or be fired.
