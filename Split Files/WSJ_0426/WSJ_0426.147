   NEW YORK -- How's this for a simple choice: You can cast
your lot with a company whose stock price more than tripled
in the past five years. Or you can side with a company in the
same industry whose stock price gained a paltry 20% in the
same period.
   That's the essence of the choice facing shareholders of
American General -- the laggard mentioned above -- which is
the object of a takeover bid and proxy fight by Torchmark,
whose stock price has been soaring.

   The performance records of the two companies make a
powerful argument for Torchmark, according to several
insurance analysts and takeover-stock speculators. But a
variety of other factors, including the unusual takeover
tactics that Torchmark has employed, have raised doubts about
whether Torchmark will win the vote at American General's
annual meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
   Those doubts, combined with the long regulatory delays
that usually accompany a hostile bid for an insurance
company, have kept American General's stock price well below
the $50 a share in cash and stock that Torchmark offered but
quickly withdrew last month.
   Yesterday, however, American General shares jumped 1 1/8
to close at 37 7/8, helped by renewed enthusiasm for takeover
stocks. Sparking that enthusiasm was Norton's agreement to
sell itself to Saint-Gobain for $90 a share, $15 a share more
than BTR PLC's hostile $75 bid.
   Meanwhile Torchmark shares sagged 1/8 to close at 45 1/8.
Since Torchmark announced its bid, its shares have fallen
because of fears about the dilution and increased debt load
that an acquisition of American General would cause.
   The case for Torchmark is that it's a lean, well-managed
company whose rising earnings and heavy stock buy-backs have
boosted its share price. "Torchmark has done a good job of
maximizing value to shareholders," says Carol Manning, a
Smith Barney insurance analyst who has neutral ratings on
both stocks. She adds: "American General shares have been
trading at a greater than average relative discount to the
market because the return to shareholders has been below
average for the life insurance industry."
   In the 1980s, American General did a lot of buying and
selling. It added more life insurance companies, shed
property-casualty units and expanded its consumer finance
business by acquiring a Manufacturers Hanover subsidiary for
$685 million in 1988. It has been slow to cut costs but
recently became more aggressive, promising annual savings of
$40 million by putting together certain Florida and Tennessee
operations. American General has also been buying back stock,
but less aggressively than Torchmark.
   Torchmark is nominating five directors of the six up for
election at American General's annual meeting. The board has
a total of 15 members who serve staggered terms. Torchmark
has said that if it wins, it will make a new acquisition
proposal.
   "We think the American General shareholders have nothing
to lose by supporting the Torchmark proxy fight," Ms. Manning
says.
   Analyst Ronald P. McIntosh at Fox-Pitt Kelton is
recommending both stocks. He believes American General will
restructure even if it remains independent, and Torchmark
will be able to cut costs and sell assets at American General
if it wins the company.
   "We have called Torchmark's the best management in the
life insurance industry," Mr. McIntosh says.
   Torchmark's administrative expenses are about 16% of
premiums in home-service life insurance compared with 24% at
American General, Mr. McIntosh says. American General argues
that commission expenses should also be included and that on
this basis its costs are only five percentage points higher
than its rival's. American General says its expenses are
higher because it operates in 25 states compared with
Torchmark's five.
   Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman, argues that
Torchmark won't be able to repeat its success with his
company. "I don't think you can draw a straight line from any
of the specifics and make a case against AG," says Mr. Hook,
adding that he expects to win the proxy vote.
   Mr. McIntosh of Fox-Pitt predicts victory for Torchmark,
although he says some institutions have been puzzled by
Torchmark's quick withdrawal of its takeover bid. By
retreating, however, Torchmark may have made it easier to
press its proxy fight without getting approval in advance
from state insurance regulators.
   The regulators, however, could still force Torchmark to
withdraw its slate before the meeting or before the results
of the vote are announced. The major hurdles are hearings in
Tennessee today and tomorrowand in Hawaii tomorrow. There's
also a federal appeals court hearing in New Orleans on
Monday. Takeover-stock speculators rate the chances of a vote
taking place on Wednesday as a little better than a tossup.
