   BOSTON -- Norton Co. agreed to be acquired for $90 a
share, or about $1.9 billion, by French glassmaker Cie. de
Saint-Gobain SA in a surprising rescue of Norton from hostile
bidder BTR PLC.
   BTR, a London-based international conglomerate, last month
launched a $75-a-share, or $1.64 billion, bid for Norton,
based in Worcester, Mass. Yesterday, BTR said it looks
forward "to realizing the benefit" of Saint-Gobain's offer.
BTR, which owns 325,500, or 1.7%, of Norton shares, added
that it was withdrawing its nominees for Norton's board. BTR
had launched a proxy fight to replace some Norton directors
at Norton's annual meeting today and had been widely expected
to succeed.

   In ruling out a higher bid for Norton, John C. Cahill,
BTR's chief executive, said, "our price was rich. I simply
can't imagine how that price {$90 a share} can be justified."
He added that BTR won't officially end its bid for Norton
until Monday, when Saint-Gobain and Norton are expected to
file their offering papers with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. (In the event the agreement with Saint-Gobain is
terminated, Norton has agreed to pay Saint-Gobain $70 million
plus $5 million to cover various expenses stemming from the
offer, according to documents filed with the SEC.)
   Last week Norton said it knew of a third party that might
top BTR's bid. But Wall Street observers hadn't expected a
friendly suitor to offer so much cash so quickly.
Saint-Gobain's offer "is extremely high and very surprising,"
said one Wall Street stock trader. "Everything Norton's
management said {after BTR's bid} indicated it wanted to
remain independent. We would own 10 times as much {of
Norton's stock} right now if we had thought the company was
for sale."
   Norton's stock, which had drifted down $1.375 a share
Tuesday to close at $75.25, surged $13.50 yesterday to close
at $88.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. BTR
purchased its Norton stake for between $49.54 and $53 a
share.
   Norton's definitive agreement with Saint-Gobain also
surprised Massachusetts officials who had backed Norton's
resistance to BTR. The agreement "is extremely surprising,"
said state Sen. Thomas White, who helped rush into law a
Massachusetts anti-takeover statute aimed at aiding Norton's
defense. "I don't know what to make of it."
   Norton's agreement with Saint-Gobain was ironic because
Norton's congressional supporters in its fight against BTR
had raised national security issues about its acquisition by
a foreign company. Yesterday, John M. Nelson, Norton's
chairman, president and chief executive officer, sidestepped
the question of whether Saint-Gobain's purchase of Norton
also raises such issues. "We don't believe they're relevant,"
he said. "The questions were raised about BTR's bid because
of its lack of commitment to continue research and
development in areas we felt are important."
   Saint-Gobain's offer for Norton reflects potential
synergies between the two concerns' businesses, officials
with both companies said. Norton, which had 1989 sales of
about $1.5 billion, makes abrasives, ceramics, plastics and
other products. Saint-Gobain, France's seventh-biggest
industrial concern with 1989 revenue of $11.59 billion, makes
glass, packaging and building materials.
   Norton's ceramics business "is fully complementary" with
Saint-Gobain's, said Jean-Louis Beffa, Saint-Gobain's
chairman. "Only about 14% of our sales are in the U.S. Norton
will bring to Saint-Gobain a very important American
presence. Norton also has a very good Japanese experience."
He added that Saint-Gobain and Norton don't directly compete
in Europe and thus don't have overlapping operations there
that would have to be consolidated.
   Saint-Gobain's last major foray in the U.S. was the
purchase of the 43% of Valley Forge, Pa.-based CertainTeed
Corp. it didn't previously own for $387 million in 1988.
Later that year the company bought Wolverine Technologies
Inc. of Dearborn, Mich., which makes vinyl products, for
$75.9 million. Saint-Gobain also has been actively acquiring
companies in Europe.
   One of Norton's attractions to Saint-Gobain is its
research on thin films made of synthetic diamond, which show
promise for use in electronics and other applications, said
Aldon Donius, an analyst with Altman, Brenner, Wasserman, a
New York research firm. "Norton didn't have the cash to play"
with larger concerns developing the technology but should be
a strong competitor with Saint-Gobain's help, he added.
Saint-Gobain's deep pockets also should aid Norton in
developing advanced ceramics for use in automobile engines
and other applications, Mr. Donius said.
   In announcing their agreement, the companies stressed that
Norton's current policies on employment and community
relations, and its headquarters and top management, won't be
changed-opposition to BTR's bid had been fueled by fears that
the British concern would close or move Norton plants and lay
off some of its workers. "There will be no changes in
employment in any Norton location as a direct result of this
merger," Mr. Nelson said in an interview yesterday. However,
he didn't rule out layoffs at Norton after its acquisition,
saying that its employment levels will depend on economic
factors unrelated to its purchase by Saint-Gobain.
   Mr. Nelson said Saint-Gobain contacted Norton about a
possible acquisition shortly after BTR's bid was announced
last month. Norton initially suggested that Saint-Gobain take
a minority stake, but Saint-Gobain wasn't interested, Mr.
Beffa said. Late Tuesday Norton's board decided to negotiate
an agreement with Saint-Gobain, which was hammered out
through the night.
   "Given the increasing risk of . . . fighting a war of
attrition only to be bought in the end by BTR for an
inadequate price with no protection for employees and the
Worcester community, we concluded {the acquisition by
Saint-Gobain} is the best alternative," Mr. Nelson said.
   Saint-Gobain's offer for Norton is the latest in a stream
of French bids for U.S. companies, including most recently
Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s friendly bid for Rorer Group Inc.,
Michelin's agreement to buy Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. and
Pechiney S.A.'s acquisition of Triangle Industries Inc., the
parent of American National Can Corp.
   Many large French companies believe that, to withstand
foreign competition and prepare for the lifting of internal
European Community trade barriers in 1992, they must
establish themselves as global forces in their core
businesses. That has provoked a rash of government-encouraged
foreign acquisitions by French companies over the past
several years.
