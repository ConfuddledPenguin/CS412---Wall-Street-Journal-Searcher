   Gannett Foundation, the largest shareholder by far in the
related Gannett Co. newspaper chain, said it may sell its 10%
stake in the company.
   The foundation, which was created in 1935 by Gannett
founder Frank Gannett, said it wants to diversify its assets
and seek a source of higher return than provided by common
stock dividends. The foundation's 15,940,185 Gannett shares
comprise substantially all of its assets.

   "Within the limits of our fiduciary responsibility, we
would prefer a transaction that puts the block in the hands
of the Gannett Co. or an employee stock-ownership plan," the
foundation's officers said in a statement. "But our financial
advisers will explore all alternatives."
   As the foundation noted, Internal Revenue Service
regulations require foundations to pay out annually an amount
equal to 5% of their assets. The foundation cited this as a
reason for contemplating the stock sale. A spokesman for the
foundation declined to comment on whether the foundation may
end up selling just part of its stake.
   William H. Strong, a managing director of Salomon Bros.,
one of several investment banks discussing the possible
divestiture with the foundation, said the Gannett foundation
"feels compelled to maximize value." As far as price, Mr.
Strong said, that means the foundation wants to receive
"meaningfully in excess of current market." In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gannett closed at
$36.75 a share, up $1.25, giving the 10% block a value of
$585.8 million.
   Gannett issued a statement saying that the company "hasn't
yet decided whether it will be in a position to be a
purchaser of the stock that may be sold by the foundation."
The company said its directors previously approved a stock
repurchase program to acquire as many as 7.5 million shares
of Gannett common stock but added that nearly three million
shares have already been acquired under that repurchase
program.
   Gannett executives couldn't be reached for comment as to
whether they're concerned about the possible effects of the
sale of such a large stake.
   The company's earnings in the first quarter were flat at
about $75 million, or 47 cents a share, but Gannett hasn't
been hurt as badly as many other newspaper chains by the
current advertising slump. USA Today is expected to begin
making a profit this year. Gannett also publishes 83 daily
newspapers and 52 nondaily publications, as well as operating
10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News
Services and a large outdoor-advertising company.
   The foundation, which along with the company is based in
Arlington, Va., funds programs in education, literacy and
First Amendment freedoms, but it is best known for the
Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University in
New York. The foundation also runs the Paul Miller Washington
Reporting Fellowships in Washington. In 1989, the foundation
said, it spent about $30 million on grants, programs and
operations.
   Mr. Strong of Salomon said that to avoid any conflicts of
interest, no current officers of the company will serve as
trustees of the foundation from now on. But Allen Neuharth,
who ran the newspaper company until he retired last year,
will continue as chairman of the foundation. Mr. Neuharth
wouldn't elaborate on the foundation's statement. He said
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp. had
been discussing the potential sale, along with Salomon, but
"we haven't selected which will do the negotiating for us."
