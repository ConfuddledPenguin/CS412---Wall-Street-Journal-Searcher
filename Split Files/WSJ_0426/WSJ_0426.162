   NEW YORK -- Less than a year after resuming operations in
the municipal bond business, L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. has halted
trading in the market and may consider leaving the tax-exempt
sector altogether.
   Joel Miller, the firm's chief executive officer, said
Rothschild has reduced its trading positions "to the bare
bone" and will decide within two weeks whether to exit the
business permanently.

   "The markets have been sloppy. It has not been
profitable," said Mr. Miller. He said the firm's decision to
leave the municipal bond market is unrelated to the financial
woes of holding company L.F. Rothschild Holdings or of its
owner, Franklin Savings Association.
   Last November, the broker-dealer re-established its
presence in the securities industry, resuming municipal
operations and dealings in investment banking, mergers and
acquisition and retail brokerage.
   The firm had halted those operations in late 1987 after
Rothschild Holdings fell victim to huge losses as a result of
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Last July, Rothschild Holdings filed for bankruptcy-court
protection. Since then, Franklin Savings has been seized by
the federal government. The unit L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. wasn't
included in the holding company's Chapter 11 filing.
