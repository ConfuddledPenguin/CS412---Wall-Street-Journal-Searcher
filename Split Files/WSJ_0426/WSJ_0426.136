   NEW YORK -- The stock market ended its losing streak in
quiet trading as investors did some bargain-hunting in the
wake of its decline over the previous five sessions.
   Advancing issues led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange for only the third time this month as the market,
buoyed by news that Norton had accepted a higher takeover
offer, rebounded in spite of another rise in interest rates.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which went down a total
of 111.27 points during the market's string of losses,
rebounded 11.94 to 2,666.44.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
added 1.67 to 332.03, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.79 to 182.30 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 1.57 to 309.52.
   Big Board gainers topped losers 774 to 664. The last time
the measure of the market's overall performance closed higher
was April 12, when 908 stocks rose and 573 fell on the Big
Board; on April 3, 1,071 issues scored gains and 431 posted
losses.
   Advancers surged to a lead of more than 2-to-1 as the
latest session got under way as early gains in the
Treasury-bond market, along with talk that the sell-off in
stocks had been overdone, sent prices higher.
   Buyers continued to focus on blue-chip stocks and steered
away from those issues tied to first-quarter earnings
disappointments, said James C. Andrews, first vice president
in charge of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc., Philadelphia.
   For example, Du Pont added 7/8 to 35 7/8 after reporting
that first-quarter net income dropped 16% from a year
earlier, in line with analysts' forecasts. Similarly,
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose 1/2 to 35 1/2 although its
earnings for the period fell about 78%.
   But the rise in prices didn't bring with it an improvement
in the level of trading activity, as Big Board volume fell to
133,480,000 shares from 137,360,000 Tuesday.
   Gail M. Dudack, a technical analyst at S.G. Warburg, cited
the continued light volume as an indication that further
weakness lies ahead for the market. "I don't think the
rebound's very strong or telling us anything wonderful," she
said.
   From a technical standpoint, Ms. Dudack said, the market
could recoup as much as half of its latest losses without
breaking out of its recent pattern of declining prices. "The
general tone of the market, to me, is negative," she says.
   Stocks rose although Treasury notes and bonds declined 1/8
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount. Treasury issues had
risen about 1/4 point early in the session.
   Panhandle Eastern closed unchanged at 26 7/8 on 1.4
million shares after issuing its first-quarter report, which
showed that net from continuing operations went up about 37%
from a year ago.
   Chrysler fell 3/8 to 15 1/2, a 52-week low. Chairman Lee
Iacocca said he hopes the company will report a profit for
the first and second quarters, but he didn't provide any
specific forecasts.
   Tambrands jumped 2 7/8 to 79 in the wake of a strong
first-quarter earnings report and news of an agreement to
sell its diagnostic unit. Terms of the sale weren't
disclosed.
   Georgia-Pacific gained 1 3/8 to 40 7/8. First Boston
upgraded the stock, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report; analyst William Wigder declined comment.
   Sotheby's Holdings rose 3/4 to 18 1/2. The company's joint
venture with William Acquavella, a New York art dealer,
reached an agreement in principle to purchase the art of the
Pierre Matisse Gallery for $142.8 million.
   Trinity Industries fell 1 to 23 3/4. The company said it
may have to take a charge in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended
last month, because of a $2.9 million inventory shortage
discovered at one of its divisions.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index barely
avoided closing at a 1990 low for the third consecutive
session by rising 0.63 to 344.52. Volume totaled 16,060,000
shares compared with 12,460,000 Tuesday. There were 270
issues advancing 238 declining and 272 unchanged.
   B.A.T Industries, which agreed to sell its Saks Fifth
Avenue unit to Investcorp for about $1.5 billion, gained 3/16
to 11 3/4 in composite trading of 1.6 million shares. As
reported, the sale is part of a restructuring plan.
   Energy Service added 1/4 to 4 5/8 on 1.2 million shares.
The company and R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a New York investment firm,
boosted their combined stake in the senior debt and equity of
Penrod Drilling to 68.8% and said they would cooperate in
efforts to restructure the company, formerly owned by the
Hunt brothers.
