   Maxicare Health Plans Inc., a Los Angeles-based health
maintenance organization, said it was unable to reach an
accord with officials of Cypress, Calif.-based PacifiCare
Health Systems Inc., a rival health-care concern that made an
unsolicited acquisition bid for Maxicare last Friday. Terms
of that bid weren't detailed.
   Maxicare has been operating under bankruptcy-law
protection for 13 months. Peter Ratican, Maxicare's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said the parties met
yesterday to discuss PacifiCare's interest. No further talks
are planned, he said. PacifiCare officials said they were
reviewing their options.

   Maxicare said it plans to pursue its reorganization plan,
and a hearing is scheduled for May 7 on the plan's disclosure
statement. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for June 25.
   About 40% of Maxicare's 320,000 members and about 70% of
PacifiCare's 636,000 members are in California.
