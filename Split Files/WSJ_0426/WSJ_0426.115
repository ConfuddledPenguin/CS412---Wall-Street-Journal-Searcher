   Tucson Electric Power Co. said it agreed in principle to
pay $25 million to Southwest Gas Corp. to settle a 1983
lawsuit.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Tucson Electric, a troubled utility, said the settlement
calls for the company to pay the money to Southwest Gas in
four installments.

   The first payment of $10 million is due before July 1.
Tucson Electric said it agreed to make three other payments
of $5 million each, plus 10% simple annual interest, on July
1 for the next three years.
   A Tucson Electric spokesman said the company set aside $25
million in reserves late last year in anticipation of the
settlement. He added that it may seek to recover the money
from its insurance carriers.
   The settlement stems from a 1983 suit in which Southwest
Gas, based in Las Vegas, Nev., claimed that Tucson Electric
breached certain representations or warranties in connection
with gas-distribution facilities it sold Southwest Gas in
1979 for $39 million.
