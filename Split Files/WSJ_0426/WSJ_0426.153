   ERIE, Pa. -- General Electric Co. expects "another good
year" in 1990, Chairman John F. Welch Jr. told the annual
meeting. But he added that "the first year of the decade will
be the toughest one in the past eight, as several of our
businesses contend with a softening U.S. economy."
   He said results this year will be aided by "especially
powerful performances from aircraft engines, power
generation, medical systems and financial services."

   Although most of the meeting was dominated by discussion
of a resolution asking the company to justify to shareholders
its continued production of nuclear materials for the defense
industry, the resolution was opposed by almost 94% of votes
cast. GE operates facilities for the Energy Department that
make nuclear material for weapons systems.
   Mr. Welch said the nuclear material business meets the
nation's defense requirements. A strong defense policy has
brought about the recent changes, and business opportunities,
in Eastern Europe, he said.
   GE also announced major contracts.
   Arrendadora International of Mexico, a leasing company,
ordered 100 GE locomotives, which will be leased to Mexico's
national railroad. Mr. Welch called the $168 million order
GE's largest export locomotive order in recent years. Fifty
units will be delivered late this year and the balance in
early 1991.
   GE's environmental systems business received a $60 million
contract to supply emission-control systems for Texas
Utilities Electric Co. The units are scheduled for commercial
operation in 1995 and 1996.
