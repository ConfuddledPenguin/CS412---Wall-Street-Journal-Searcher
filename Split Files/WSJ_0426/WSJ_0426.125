   Cyprus Minerals Co. reported net income fell 63%, on a
1.4% decline in revenue, due to lower copper and molybdenum
prices and higher costs at some of its mines.
   For the first quarter, net income declined to $30.1
million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $80 million, or
$1.96 a share, in the year-earlier period. Year-ago earnings
included a $5 million gain from the sale of clay operations.
Revenue declined to $429.5 million, from $435.8 million.

   Denver-based Cyprus said it is seeing improvement in
copper production costs, but the mining company doesn't
expect 1990 earnings to be higher than 1989 earnings. For all
of 1989, Cyprus earned $250.1 million on revenue of $1.79
billion.
   The large earnings drop indicates how vulnerable the
company's earnings still are to fluctuations in copper
prices, despite efforts to diversify into other kinds of
mining ventures over the past five years. Each one cent
increase in copper production costs, or one cent decrease in
the price of copper, results in a 10-cent a share decline in
annual earnings for Cyprus, said R. Wayne Atwell, analyst at
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
