   In your March 27 article "Debate Grows Over Rationing
Medical Care," the case of Tishna Rollo, an eight-year-old
girl with kidney cancer, had nothing to do with rationing. It
concerned limiting the use of a medical technology until it
has been proven safe and effective for a given medical
condition.
   The proposed treatment of kidney cancer with a bone marrow
transfusion, a very expensive procedure often associated with
harmful side effects, has no scientific basis as a treatment
in this instance. Such inappropriate use of medical
technology has been estimated to contribute as much as 50% of
the increase in our nation's annual health-care costs.

<TEXT>
   Implicit rationing or "silent rationing" has been with us
for many years as you indicate, but while rationing has been
advocated as a means to control health-care costs, it has not
been adopted as official national policy. As you point out,
the fact that 30 million (actually, more than 35 million)
Americans have no health insurance constitutes a form of
rationing. In my view, the large number of our citizens who
have little or no access to health care is a national
disgrace. There are many steps we could take to make our
system more efficient; one of these steps could be to reduce
the inappropriate and wasteful use of expensive medical
technologies.
