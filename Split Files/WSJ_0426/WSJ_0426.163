   When the major industrialized countries ended the fixed
exchange-rate system 16 years ago, they saw their decision as
a triumph for the free market: No longer would exchange rates
be set by governments and be subject to the vagaries of
political developments. No longer could speculators get rich
by anticipating, or even precipitating, exchange-rate
adjustments. No longer could fiscally irresponsible economies
export their inflation.
   But the costs of floating exchange rates have been far
greater than expected. Trade imbalances have generally
widened since 1974. The advantage of independent monetary
policy to countries has been small; there is a growing
consensus that stable and predictable policy rules are best.
For example, the G-7, the group of the West's and Asia's
seven most industrialized countries, has met several times
over the past five years to coordinate policy. Exchange-rate
volatility has been large and costly to international trade.
It is time to consider the return to a fixed-exchange rate
system. There is even a model for such a system -- the
monetary coordination of the various districts of the Federal
Reserve in the U.S. today.

   Those who argue that fixed exchange rates cannot work
assume, at least implicitly, that currency is essentially no
different from other goods. Since exchange rates are the
relative prices of currencies and since standard price theory
demonstrates that it is impossible to fix the relative prices
of goods in the long run, skeptics argue that a fixed
exchange rate system is not feasible.
   But the conventional argument does not apply to exchange
rates because today's currencies are fiat currencies: They
are intrinsically worthless pieces of paper that are
virtually costless to produce. This means that a government
can always avoid depleting the buffer stock of its currency
simply by printing more. Therefore, fixing exchange rates is
feasible, and any rate will work. That fixed exchange rates
are theoretically feasible, however, does not mean they are
politically acceptable. Under fixed rates, the country with
the fastest growing money supply gets the most seigniorage
(revenue) from money creation. More important, some of this
seigniorage is collected from residents of other countries
because, with fixed exchange rates, the inflation caused by
one country's money growth is experienced by all countries.
This outcome is bound to be politically unacceptable to other
countries. A country can prevent another from exporting
inflation by letting its own exchange rate appreciate. As a
result, countries will not adhere to fixed rates unless they
are willing to coordinate their monetary policies.
   The policy coordination necessary for fixed exchange
rates, however, is not that all countries agree to have their
money supplies grow at roughly the same rate. Even if these
money growth rates were the same and other economic
fundamentals unchanged, recent research shows that exchange
rates can fluctuate simply because people think they will.
   The policy coordination required to fix exchange rates has
two components:
   -- Each country must agree to swap its currency for
another's at the fixed rate in any amount and at any time.
   -- Countries must agree on the total growth of money and
how the resulting seigniorage will be distributed among them.
   Central banks would have no problem meeting the first
component. If a central bank temporarily ran out of a foreign
currency, it could always swap its own currency for the other
with the appropriate foreign central bank. This arrangement
prevents exchange rates from fluctuating because of
speculation, since it guarantees that any amount of a
currency demanded will always be supplied at the fixed price.
And if countries meet the second component, they will have no
incentive to overissue their moneys.
   The Bretton Woods system is usually cited as evidence of
the fragility of fixed exchange-rate systems. But Bretton
Woods is not really a test of whether a fixed exchange-rate
system will work. A fixed-rate system requires that policy
coordination include an agreement among countries about the
amount of seigniorage and its distribution. This component of
policy coordination was missing from the Bretton Woods
system, which attempted to fix exchange rates while allowing
each country some control of its own seigniorage.
   A proper test of whether fixed exchange rates are feasible
needs evidence from a system with the two required components
of policy coordination in place. Such a system exists, and it
is running smoothly -- the monetary system of the U.S.
   To many, the notion that the U.S. has a fixed
exchange-rate system may come as a surprise. The notes issued
by the Federal Reserve System look like and are used as a
single currency. Each note is printed in black and green ink,
each has "The United States of America" inscribed on front
and back, and each says it is a "Federal Reserve Note" and
"legal tender for all debts, public and private."
Furthermore, the notes exchange at par: a $20 bill swaps
one-for-one with any other $20 bill, one-for-two with any $10
bills, and so forth.
   In what sense, then, does the U.S. have something other
than a single currency? A closer look reveals that, in fact,
each of the 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System
issues its own notes. Each note is identified by its district
bank in four ways: First, on the front left is a circle with
the district bank's name written around the inside. Second,
in the middle of that circle is a bold, black letter
representing the Federal Reserve district of origin -- A for
the first district, B for the second and so forth. Third, the
letter symbol is the first character of the serial number.
Fourth, the district's number is printed on the front four
times.
   Granted, these differences among Federal Reserve notes are
much less distinct than those between, say, U.S. and Italian
currencies. Nevertheless, in a physical sense, U.S. currency
is not strictly uniform. The importance of these physical
differences is that they represent the possibility that the
U.S. could choose to have a floating exchange rate system
among the currencies of the 12 Federal Reserve districts.
Instead, the U.S. has chosen a system of fixed exchange
rates.
   That the U.S. has had no trouble maintaining its fixed
exchange rate system demonstrates that such a system is
feasible. Despite changes in economic fundamentals among
Federal Reserve districts, the U.S. has not been forced to
adjust the exchange rates between district currencies. This
is not what the skeptics of fixed rates claim would happen.
What if the Ninth District economy were declining while the
other district economies were expanding? Or what if the Ninth
District were running a trade deficit with the rest of the
country? Then, skeptics claim, there should be some downward
pressure on Ninth District currency. This, of course has
never happened, nor is it likely.
   The reason the U.S. system of fixed exchange rates works
is that it has the two required components of monetary policy
coordination: First, the district Federal Reserve banks have
an agreement to swap their currencies for any other
district's at the fixed rate in any amount and at any time.
Because of this agreement, it's unlikely that many people
have ever lost sleep over the exchange value of their
district's notes relative to another's.
   Second, district Fed banks also have an agreement on how
to set the rate of money growth and how to distribute the
resulting seigniorage. Each district bank participates in the
policy process (at Federal Open Market Committee meetings),
and a unified policy action is carried out for all 12
districts. No individual district bank can pursue its own
monetary policy. Furthermore, all seigniorage is pooled and
disbursed by the U.S. Treasury. By design, no district bank
can gain by issuing more of its notes than another. Even if
all notes were issued by, say, the Ninth District, the
revenue would still be pooled and disbursed by the Treasury.
   This example of the U.S. monetary system shows that when
the two required components of policy coordination are met, a
fixed exchange rate system is feasible.
