   Mr. Bedford, a real estate developer, acquired his stake
in ICM, a New York-based real estate investment trust, two
months ago. At the time, Mr. Bedford said he acquired the
stake to expand his real estate holdings and make his real
estate portfolio more liquid.
   ICM, which considers Mr. Bedford's interest friendly,
encouraged the initial Bedford investment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
ICM shares closed at $7.25, up 37.5 cents.
