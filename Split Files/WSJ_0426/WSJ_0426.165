   The head of marketing for Wang Laboratories Inc.'s
electronic image business left for a smaller firm, in a blow
to Wang's efforts to find renewed growth in its technology
for the paperless office.
   Analysts estimate that the image business probably
contributes less than 5% of Wang's revenue, which amounted to
$2.87 billion last year, but it has been growing rapidly and
Wang's technology is widely praised. The image business, a
step toward the paperless office, involves scanning and
electronically storing business documents so they can be
recalled, copied and passed around without struggling with
file drawers and paper copies.

   David McWhorter, director of world-wide imaging for Wang,
left to become vice president sales and marketing for Image
Business Systems Corp., a small New York-based imaging
company.
   The defection, which follows the departure of several
other executives in the department, comes at a bad time for
Wang, which expects to announce its fifth consecutive
quarterly loss tomorrow.
   A spokesman for Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., said that
Mr. McWhorter's departure won't affect the company's
marketing, because image-product marketing has been turned
over to Wang marketing groups that sell all types of
equipment to certain customer segments.
   Nevertheless, consultants who follow the industry were
surprised. "It's a loss for Wang," said Scott McCready, who
follows the industry for International Data Corp., a market
researcher in Framingham, Mass. "Very few people in the
industry know anything about image. McWhorter could get
customers and sales people excited."
   Mr. McCready estimated that the U.S. electronic image
industry grew 68% last year to $525 million from $312
million, and he said he expects to see 50% annual growth "for
the foreseeable future."
   At a time when Wang's traditional word processor and
minicomputer businesses are collapsing because of competition
from personal computers, executives have counted on the image
business to spur new-equipment sales.
   Late last year, Wang lost another leader of its imaging
effort with the resignation of Roger Sullivan, program
manager for Wang Integrated Image Systems. He became a
consultant with industry researcher BIS CAP International
Inc., Norwell, Mass., and recently was named president of the
Association for Information and Image Management, the
industry's major trade group, as well.
   Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. McWhorter's departure shows
"the technoids are winning," at Wang. He said that the image
group "is concentrating more and more on the technical side
of the house," while ignoring the "people who have gotten out
on the street and talked to {customers} about their strategic
business needs."
   The Wang spokesman said that salespeople who consistently
deal with the same sets of customers, in market segments like
banking and government, now sell the image products.
   Mr. McWhorter said that his move to Image Business
Systems, which expects $12 million in sales this year, is "an
opportunity to work at the grass-roots level, which I enjoy."
He added that "Wang's infrastructure should allow them to do
well."
   Wang is one of the leaders in the image industry. BIS CAP
International said that it has counted 570 image
installations in the U.S. Of the total, Wang supplied 220;
FileNet Corp., San Diego, supplied 180; and International
Business Machines Corp. supplied 25. Since IBM's systems tend
to be larger and more expensive, its revenue share may be
close to the other two leaders, a spokeswoman said.
   Despite its early lead in the market, Wang is having
trouble because customers worry about its financial outlook
and ability to survive.
   Wang has been cutting costs and selling off some assets to
reduce debt, but weak sales have made a turnaround slower
than expected.
   Wang Class B stock closed yesterday at $4.875, unchanged,
in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
