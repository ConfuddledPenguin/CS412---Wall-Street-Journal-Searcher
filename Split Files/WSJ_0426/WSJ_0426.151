   DALLAS -- Mesa Limited Partnership, citing continued
disappointing prices for natural gas and cash-flow problems,
said it will omit its preferred distribution payment of $1.50
a unit starting in the second quarter.
   The natural gas producer, led by partner T. Boone Pickens
Jr., said it will suspend payment on its preferred units
after its May 15 distribution until "natural gas prices go
up." The company has promised the payment of five more
quarterly distributions and said those will accumulate until
it has the cash flow to reinstate the distribution, a Mesa
spokesman said. Mesa, which eliminated its common
distribution last quarter, said the latest move will save it
about $33 million a quarter.

   Mesa has been burdened for some time by a heavy debt load,
which stood at $1.52 billion at Dec. 31, and disappointing
prices for its natural gas. But because its common and
preferred units' prices tend to trade based on their
distributions, Mr. Pickens has been insistent about retaining
the payouts even when the company's cash flow didn't justify
it. In recent years, he has taken on additional debt, sold
assets and relied on gains on securities transactions to make
more than $1 billion in distributions.
   After trading as high as $12.125 last year, Mesa's
preferred closed at $5.875, down 12.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Its common units,
which had traded as high as $12, closed at $5.25, down 12.5
cents.
   Earlier this month, Mesa dropped its effort to sell
interests in its prime Hugoton Field properties for as much
as $400 million, citing poor market conditions. Those
proceeds were to be used to reduce its debt.
   In the first quarter, the company's interest costs were
$46.4 million, or nearly half of Mesa's $96.5 million in
first-quarter revenue. Meanwhile, its cash from operations
for the quarter was about $31 million, down 27% from $42.7
million in the yearearlier period. Mesa reported a net loss
for the quarter of $18.2 million, or 30 cents a common unit,
and said it will continue to report losses until gas prices
rise.
   In the comparable 1989 period, Mesa had net income of
$14.6 million, or 15 cents a unit, on revenue of $105
million. The year-ago quarter included $43.9 million in
interest expense and $41.9 million in gains from securities
transactions, most from profits on takeover trading.
Securities gains during the latest quarter were only $3.8
million.
   Mr. Pickens said that the company decided to suspend the
preferred distribution because "the warmest weather in 30
years" offered "no significant improvement in prices this
past winter."
