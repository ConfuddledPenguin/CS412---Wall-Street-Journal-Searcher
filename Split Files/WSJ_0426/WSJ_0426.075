   HOME BUYERS find mortgages tougher to get in some markets.
   Southern California lenders are cracking down as their
super-hot real estate market cools off. Lenders won't give
90% financing any more on condominiums costing up to
$225,000, says Lou Piatt of realty firm Jon Douglas Co.,
Beverly Hills. And the loan application process has gotten
"more painful," he says. One benefit of tougher lending
standards, says Scott McAfee of Security Pacific National
Bank, is the elimination of "speculative buyers."

   Higher interest rates and concern over loan quality are
leading to "an environment where it is a bit more difficult
to qualify for a loan," says Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America. Mortgage Access Corp., Morris
Plains, N.J., is "taking a harder look at documentation, at
credit-card debt and at home appraisals," but says that
doesn't necessarily mean higher turndown rates.
   Chase Home Mortgage, Tampa, Fla., says approvals are up
20% while the dollar amount of new loans is up 50%.
                                                                                                       

   NINJA TURTLES invade the stores with products from candy
to surfboards.
   Cowabunga] The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have arrived
-- on underwear, silver coins, talking toothbrushes, watches
and bubble bath. With more than 600 turtle products, retail
sales have already hit $650 million, says Cheryl Prindle of
Mirage Studios, Northampton, Mass. That doesn't include
unlicensed gear, such as the recently spotted Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle yarmulke. "It is as hot as can be," says Michael
Goldstein of Toys "R" Us Inc. Action figures sell out there
almost as soon as they arrive.
   Who's buying? Kids mostly, says Mr. Goldstein. But already
some appear to be eyeing the products as collectibles. As
children growing up now start looking back, "they might
indeed push demand quite high," says Eric Alberta of
Christie's, New York. Ninja Turtle paraphernalia could
appreciate, says antique-guide author Terry Kovel, but only
if the phenomenon lasts. "There has to be enough so that you
can collect them, but not so much that you find them every
time you turn around."
                                                                                                       

   STATES' FISCAL WOES grow as the economy slows.
   "State revenues are slowing down dramatically," says
Marcia Howard of the National Association of State Budget
Officers, leaving many struggling with commitments made in
more prosperous times. Some 37 states expect to outspend
revenue in their fiscal 1990 general funds -- more than
double those reporting a shortfall a year earlier, says City
&amp; State magazine. Compounding the problem: 1990 is an
election year, making politicians loathe to raise taxes.
   The Northeast is feeling the pinch most. In the nine-state
region, only Maine, Connecticut and New Jersey will end
fiscal 1990 with a general-fund balance exceeding 1% of their
fund budgets. Five states will have no balance, the magazine
says. Not all states are hurting. Several states in the West
and Northwest "are absolutely booming," says Ms. Howard,
naming Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Nevada as examples.
   Having opted for short-term solutions this year, states
will find it even tougher to make ends meet in 1991, says
Michael Vlaisavljevich of Price Waterhouse.
                                                                                                       

   DIRTY CAR BLUES: Most motorists surveyed by the
International Carwash Association say it depresses them to
drive a dirty car. The psychologist who conducted the study
says one reason may be that car dust, recirculated by heaters
or air conditioners, creates an imbalance of positive ions.
                                                                                                       

   COMPACT DISK PACKAGING comes under fire for creating too
much waste. An organization called Ban the Box, New York,
wants the recording industry to formulate a plan for
replacing the current 6-by-12 inch "long box," perhaps by
actually buying reusable display frames for retailers.
                                                                                                       

   A WORLD WAR II card trick is honored at this weekend's
45th reunion of POWs from Stalag Luft III, site of the Great
Escape. Playing cards with escape maps glued inside,
patterned after those used during the war, will be presented
to a former POW officer by U.S. Playing Card Co.
                                                                                                       

   THE MILITARY CONSUMER attracts more marketing dollars.
   "We have become a hot market," says Nat Kornfeld of the
Army Times Publishing Co., New York. Why? "It is the only
market without recession or unemployment." Consumer companies
began recognizing that fact in the mid-80s and set up special
military sales departments. Now, in the face of the current
military downsizing, some are stepping up, rather than
cutting back, their marketing efforts.
   Calling military personnel one of its largest
consumer-spending groups, AT&amp;T plans to sponsor more special
events and concerts. It also takes aim at the retiree and
reserve market. "With the cutbacks we are trying to basically
maintain our market share and, if anything, grow it," says
Deanna Kenny, AT&amp;T's military market manager. Traditionally
viewed as a male market, the military is likely to get more
play from companies making household products, says Carol
Karasick of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.
   Calling the military "a good market," she says it gives
advertisers access to young families just forming their
buying habits.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: New York state puts an "under 21" label on
licenses issued to young drivers, making it tougher to alter
the IDs to buy liquor illegally. . . . Asparagus charlotte is
the dessert offering in the asparagus festival at Cafe
Suisse, New York.
