   MOSCOW -- On an unusually warm April afternoon, David
Ryzhak is enjoying a swim and sunbath at the Moscow Swimming
Pool. A retired military pilot, Mr. Ryzhak, 67 years old, is
fit and suntanned; several gold teeth gleam in his smile. He
comes to this gigantic, decrepit, heated outdoor pool at the
foot of the Kremlin wall every day it is open, even in the
dead of winter.
   In summertime, the pool is closed for repairs. In
subfreezing weather, Mr. Ryzhak and some 8,000 other
Muscovites use it each day. When the temperature rises above
freezing, the number swells to 15,000.

   In a city where winter offers little recreation, this is a
simple pleasure, and good for you, too, Russians say. But
history has complicated it. The pool happens to occupy the
basement of what was once the magnificent Christ the Savior
Cathedral, dynamited on Joseph Stalin's orders 59 years ago.
Now, the Russian Orthodox Church and many devout private
citizens, all enjoying greater religious freedom under
Mihkail Gorbachev, want to get rid of the pool and rebuild
the cathedral.
   The reconstruction movement has created a passionate
debate, tinged with re-emergent Russian nationalism and
Dostoyevskian issues of morality and state -- or individual
-- responsibility.
   Mr. Ryzhak takes a pragmatic view. It costs only 50
kopeks, or 80 cents, to use the pool, a sauna and shower,
and, he says, "We are paupers. There are so many other things
to worry about." As to responsibility for the cathedral's
fate, he says, "It's the system, not the fault of the
people."
   Another swimmer, Ada Budkevich, a buxom, 55-year-old
building engineer, says that because the old cathedral could
never be precisely replicated, the money should be spent on
"all the things that are falling to pieces elsewhere." Still,
Ms. Budkevich confesses to "a certain guilty feeling because
everybody had a hand in what was done to the church."
   Other swimmers gather to argue. "It is extremely important
to raise the moral value of the society," says Nina Bourkina,
a cathedral partisan.
   "It's not for nothing that this place was chosen for the
cathedral," says Marina Ignatava, a slender 30-year-old in a
bikini. "I can find another place to swim."
   Articles on the cathedral have appeared regularly in
Moscow newspapers. A TV station has broadcast a 12-minute
documentary showing the church's demolition. A conservative
nationalist newspaper, Literaturnaya Rossiya, has launched a
fundraising drive for the cathedral, and cash has come from
supporters rich and poor.
   Several benefit concerts by well-known Russian singers
have been held here. Money may even come from America; Arkady
Nebolsin, of New York, president of the American Society for
the Preservation of Monuments and Culture in Russia, says the
group will begin a fund drive.
   "It is a signal of common grief and the necessity to plead
guilty to what we have done to ourselves," Bishop Vladimir of
the Orthodox Church's Moscow diocese says of the
reconstruction movement.
   Built in the late 19th century to commemorate the Russian
victory over Napoleon, the cathedral was an architectural
masterpiece of gilded cupolas, imported marbles and frescoes
that took 40 years and 15 million rubles to complete. Some
called it the eighth miracle of the world.
   Stalin, during an anti-religious campaign, decided the
site would be good for a state Palace of Soviets. At noon on
Dec. 5, 1931, shortly after the cathedral's chimes rang for
the last time, it was dynamited, and collapsed in a mushroom
cloud of dust. The Soviet government is said to have salvaged
the gold from the cupolas and appropriated some of the
frescoes, which now reside in a state museum.
   The basement was enlarged for the planned palace. When the
land proved too swampy for such a huge structure, the
basement was tiled and turned into a swimming pool -- a
sunken circle of now-cracked tiles six times the size of a
standard Olympic pool.
   The campaign to rebuild the church is based in the tiny,
cluttered office of Yuri Yushkin, the editor of Literaturnaya
Rossiya. Sitting at his desk amid piles of yellowing
newspapers, he says the pool sits at Russia's spiritual
center. The cathedral was a history text, he says, its walls
bearing the names of heroes in Russia's 1812 victory over
Napoleon. Its name evoked the belief that Christ saved Russia
from the invasion. So the pool is sacrilegious, he says --
and "a most disgraceful and dirty thing to have right there
at the Kremlin wall."
   So far, 468,000 rubles have been raised toward a goal of
200 million rubles, or $320 million. Mr. Yushkin reads some
of the messages that donors have written: "Let my drop enter
the sea," says "Slave Alexandra," of the Tambouv region, who
sends 10 rubles. "Here is my month's salary," says Julia
Manko of Donetsk, who sends 365 rubles. A Mr. Kibetz, of
Magadan, includes words of a prayer with his 50 rubles.
   Mr. Yushkin believes the cathedral could be rebuilt by
2012, bicentennial of Napoleon's retreat. Large problems
loom, however. Mr. Yushkin thinks their resolution will prove
the sincerity of Mr. Gorbachev's program for a freer society.
   The land belongs to the government. A special decree would
be required to return it to the church. The Supreme Soviet
and the Council of Ministers haven't even responded to a
church request for permission to begin rebuilding -- much
less promised money for it, as Mr. Yushkin and church
officials would like. If the government denies permission,
the church plans to appeal to Mr. Gorbachev.
   Christ the Savior must also compete for money with another
church project, already approved by the government,
commemorating the Christianization of Russia a thousand years
ago.
   And then there are the swimming pool partisans to contend
with. Nikolai Portnov, the gray-haired pool director, calls
cathedral reconstruction "a utopian idea. Of course it is sad
and bad that the cathedral was brought down, but since the
pool exists and is so popular, what is the point of bringing
it down, too?"
   Mr. Portnov has his own dream for the pool site:
rebuilding it as part of a first-class sports and recreation
area. He says the disrepair of the pool embarrasses him; the
saunas are dark and moldy and the spartan locker rooms
filthy. An architect's rendering of a proposed renovation
hangs on his office wall. The design was commissioned by the
Moscow city government in 1981 and approved in 1985. A new
city government dropped the project in 1986.
   The church was the stumbling block, says Yuri Knyazev, a
Moscow sports-facility official. The Moscow City Council, he
says, sees no point in spending money on the pool if it is to
be closed and the land given back to the church. The Soviet
government already has returned more than 3,000 cathedrals
and other properties to the church.
   Mr. Portnov says he has heard nothing from cathedral
promoters, but he did meet some recent visitors who, because
of the sanctity of the site, came to be baptized in the pool.
Mr. Portnov finds the spiritual mystique of the place a bit
strange. Gesturing toward the hundreds of swimmers bobbing in
the pool's greenish water with their brightly colored bathing
caps, he says: "This is a far cry from the Ganges River."
