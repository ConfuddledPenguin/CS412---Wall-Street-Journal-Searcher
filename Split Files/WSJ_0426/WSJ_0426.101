   Just a week after the Food and Drug Administration forced
the bottlers of Perrier water to drop the words "naturally
sparkling" from its labels, the French company is coming
under fire from New York state health officials over its use
of the term "sodium-free."
   New York state health officials said a sample of Perrier
water provided by the company contained too much sodium for
the company to use the term "sodium-free" under FDA
regulations.

   Their complaint throws a wrench into the planned relaunch
of the product. Late yesterday, worried Perrier officials
were in Albany in an effort to persuade health officials to
let Perrier return to store shelves today, as the company had
promised.
   Source Perrier S.A. has been scrambling to get its product
back on the market and restore consumer confidence following
the global recall in February of the popular French mineral
water. The recall occurred after tiny amounts of benzene, a
known carcinogen, were found in small samples of the trendy
drink.
   The FDA, which had signed off on Perrier's U.S. relaunch,
said it intends to examine the data that Perrier supplied to
New York officials.
   FDA regulations allow water marketers to use the term
"sodium-free" if there are five milligrams or less of sodium
per eight-ounce serving, or 21.2 milligrams per liter. One
test of a sample that Perrier Group of America Inc. provided
to New York state revealed a sodium level of 21.6 milligrams.
   The state officials also expressed anger over reports that
bottles of Perrier have already returned to the market in New
York, even though the state hasn't given a go-ahead on the
reintroduction. "We have not returned their certification at
this point," said William Stasiuk, director of the state's
Center for Environmental Health, indicating that the return
in New York is still up in the air. New York would be the
first state to see Perrier back on the shelves.
   Mr. Stasiuk said the sodium levels, like the previous
traces of benzene, don't pose any significant health risk.
But, he said, "people who are on severely sodium-restricted
diets should be cautioned" about the amount of sodium in
Perrier.
   Kim Jeffrey, Perrier's senior vice president of marketing,
said Perrier conducted many tests of its new water through
five independent laboratories. Two of those samples,
including the sample that registered 21.6 milligrams of
sodium, were sent to New York state. When New York officials
asked about the sodium levels, Perrier sent 79 additional
samples. Of those, one additional sample had a sodium level
that exceeded federal standards, the rest were all
satisfactory, Mr. Jeffrey said.
   "We conform to the guidelines for the sodium-free
designation," he added. He said the average sodium level for
all the samples was 17.1 milligrams per liter.
   New York state officials also asserted yesterday that some
samples of old Perrier water have turned up in stores on New
York's Long Island. Mr. Stasiuk said that although officials
haven't conducted a "scientific health department search,"
the codes on the bottles and the absence of a special label
indicated the bottles predated the world-wide recall of
Perrier. The reintroduced Perrier would carry a label saying
"nouvelle production."
   In a letter to the health officials, Mr. Jeffrey said
Perrier Group, the French company's U.S. arm, based in
Greenwich, Conn., plans to run a special ad in Long Island's
Newsday newspaper warning consumers to buy only Perrier that
has the "nouvelle production" labels.
   Mr. Jeffrey acknowledged that Perrier is having difficulty
getting into the New York market, but he said the problems
generally involve "administrative issues relative to issues
surrounding the entire bottled-water category." He declined
to elaborate.
   Mr. Jeffrey said he didn't know that Perrier was already
being sold in some delicatessens and supermarkets in New York
state. He said that the company's distributors cover the
tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and
added that the problem was probably in the distribution
chain, adding: "I have not authorized the product to be sold
in New York . . . period."
   After it announced its recall, Perrier attributed the
benzene contamination to improper filtration of its carbon
dioxide gas. The gas, Perrier says, naturally contains small
amounts of benzene. The filters apparently became overloaded
after Perrier switched to a new gas source. Perrier says it
has improved its filtration process, and the FDA says tests
indicate the water is no longer contaminated.
   That done, Perrier ran into a whole different problem last
week, when the FDA told the company it couldn't put
"naturally sparkling" on labels. The agency based its ruling
on the fact that Perrier takes the water and the carbon
dioxide separately out of its spring. The carbonation
therefore is artificial, the FDA said.
