   West Point-Pepperell Inc., West Point, Ga., said it has
pulled its apparel fabrics division off the auction block
because of low preliminary bids.
   In its annual report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the textile concern said it had
solicited offers for the division -- its most profitable
behind household fabrics -- but stopped pending an
improvement in the financial markets and its parent company's
financial position.

   West Point Acquisition Corp., the company set up by
William F. Farley to purchase West Point-Pepperell last year
for about $1.56 billion, is in dire straits. Earlier this
month, West Point Acquisition defaulted on $796 million in
bank debt and on interest payments on $705 million in
subordinated debt.
   The company reiterated in the filing that it is
negotiating with its bankers, led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and
Bankers Trust Co., and has made an exchange offer to its
bondholders in an effort to restructure debt incurred in the
acquisition.
   Last month, the company got only $410 million in cash and
notes for its Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co. unit, after projecting it
would fetch more than $600 million.
