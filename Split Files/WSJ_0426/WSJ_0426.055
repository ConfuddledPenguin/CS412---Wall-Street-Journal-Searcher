   WARREN, N.J. -- Immunomedics Inc. said the European Patent
Office upheld its monoclonal antibody patent for Europe,
where it had been challenged by several pharmaceutical
companies.
   Immunomedics, which is using monoclonal antibody-based
technology in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, says it
has one product in final clinical trials and expects to file
for approval from the Food and Drug Administration early next
year.
