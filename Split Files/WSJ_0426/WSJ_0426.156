   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp., seeking to join the ranks of
oil companies who tout themselves as clean-air enthusiasts,
is expected to announce today a plan to buy 7,000 old gas
guzzlers and take them off this city's smoggy freeways.
   Unocal's proposal, which involves purchasing and scrapping
pre-1971 automobiles, is expected to be one of a series of
initiatives disclosed by Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier at a
news conference here. A second proposal calls for free
off-year smog checks for vehicles, supplementing the
California smog certification that car owners must obtain
every two years.

   Unocal's Los Angeles-based competitor, Atlantic Richfield
Co., has launched an environmental advertising campaign built
around a low-emission regular gasoline introduced in Southern
California in September. Other oil companies have moved in
the same direction, with environmentally oriented ad
campaigns and with research into cleaner-burning fuels.
