   Tonight ABC News will broadcast a television documentary
on U.S. policy toward Cambodia entitled "Peter Jennings
Reporting: From the Killing Fields." The film makes
astonishing charges: that the Khmer Rouge, which murdered a
million people during the 3 1/2 years it ruled Cambodia, is
poised to return to power, and that the U.S. is assisting
that return. If true, the charges would be a shocking
indictment of the morality of American foreign policy. But
they are false.
   ABC has conjured up an image of Cambodia run by a flawed
but legitimate central government, a government abandoned by
its Vietnamese allies, whose only concern is to prevent the
return of the Khmer Rouge. In this Cambodia, the Soviet Union
plays no role (the words "Soviet Union" are not uttered
throughout the broadcast) and Chinese backing for the
resistance seems dwarfed by America's.

   Of course, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful military force of
perhaps 40,000 armed men, and it certainly aspires to return
to power. But it is far from likely to seize it soon. What
strength the Khmer Rouge does have it receives from people
too young to remember its crimes, who are attracted by the
nationalist appeal of Khmer Rouge propaganda against the
Vietnamese.
   But ABC pays little attention to the Vietnamese role in
Cambodia. Nothing is said about the two-centuries old history
of Vietnamese expansion at Cambodia's expense or about the
thousands of Vietnamese political and military advisers
remaining in Cambodia, or about the Vietnamese troops who are
reportedly still fighting there.
   All that ABC chooses to say about the Vietnamese role in
Cambodia is that it is over. On screen, former CIA director
William Colby substantiates the program's bald assertion that
the Vietnamese have withdrawn from Cambodia. Since he left
the intelligence agency, Mr. Colby seems to have lost access
not only to classified cable traffic but even to newspapers.
How else could he have missed the report on the front page of
the Feb. 23 issue of the New York Times, in which East
European diplomats said that one month after Vietnam's much
publicized withdrawal from Cambodia, resistance successes had
compelled Hanoi to reinject thousands of elite Vietnamese
troops to save Cambodia's western provinces for Phnom Penh?
   The Vietnamese communists did not just leave behind a
government "in their own image" as ABC puts it. Hanoi retains
control over it. That is the function of some of the
thousands of Vietnamese advisers who work in government
ministries and Phnom Penh's armed forces, as well as the
Vietnamese ambassador's daily meetings with the Cambodian
cabinet.
   Nor, in a documentary concerned with exposing an American
aid program of $20 million per year, is there any discussion
of the lavish arming of Phnom Penh by the Soviet Union --
$350 million in 1987, according to the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, and probably considerably more now. These
facts make nonsense of Peter Jenning's extraordinary
statement about the Phnom Penh regime: "The Defense Minister
knows that his troops, alone, without the Vietnamese, have a
real problem fighting forces supported by two superpowers:
the United States and China."
   ABC notes that the communist leaders in Phnom Penh are
former Khmer Rouge. But it does not tell us that they are
unrepentant former Khmer Rouge, complicit in enormous
atrocities. The character of Phnom Penh leaders explains the
regime's "mistreatment of its political opponents," as ABC
delicately puts it. Amnesty International, more candidly,
reported thousands of political prisoners in Cambodia in
1987. Amnesty has also expressed concern about "systematic
torture," and executions of prisoners without trial.
   ABC suggests that the noncommunist Cambodian resistance is
engaged in military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge. After
broadcasting a denial of any cooperation by Gen. Sak
Satsuyak, military commander of the noncommunist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, ABC attempts to discredit
the denial with a film of Khmer Rouge and noncommunist
soldiers fraternizing at the town of Thmar Puok, after its
capture by the noncommunists. This is evidence of nothing: As
one Cambodian witness, human rights activist Kassie Neou has
told me, the Khmer Rouge controlled some villages near the
town, and some of their soldiers passed through Thmar Puok
after it was taken. Khmer Rouge and noncommunist soldiers
from the same regions may spontaneously fraternize, even
though their commanders do not.
   Eager to make a case of direct American support for the
Khmer Rouge, ABC leaves its "smoking gun" for the last
segment. After continuous denials from Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Solomon that the American-run Cambodian Working
Group in Thailand, which coordinates Western support for the
noncommunists, has any involvement with the Khmer Rouge, ABC
cuts to a hidden camera film of another American, Denny
Laine, at a Bangkok cafe. Mr. Jennings says: "This man knows
the details -- Special Forces Colonel Denny Laine -- former
military attache at the Bangkok embassy. When he was still on
active duty in Thailand, he was assigned to the UN border
relief operation. Where he had good access to the Khmer
Rouge."
   But Col. Laine's secondment to the UN border relief
operation and his access to the Khmer Rouge had nothing to do
with the Cambodian working group or the American military
role in Cambodia, as Mr. Jennings insinuates. Col. Laine was
assigned to UNBRO's Displaced Persons Unit, set up by the
Thais in response to foreign concern about human rights
abuses in the refugee camps. His visits to Khmer Rouge camps,
like those of his fellow officers from Britain, Sweden and
Australia, were not connected with covert U.S. aid to the
Khmer Rouge, but with trying to protect the human rights of
civilians in Khmer Rouge camps. The deceitful insinuation
about Col. Laine's mission is a telling reflection on ABC's
program.
   America's Cambodia policy is not, as ABC suggests, the
Bush administration's alone; nor has it been dictated by the
needs of alliance with China. The policy has bipartisan
congressional support, most strikingly from Rep. Stephen
Solarz (D., N.Y.), one of the harshest critics of the Bush
administration's China policy.
   How could ABC air such a misleading account of American
policy in Cambodia? Part of the answer is the attitude of
producer Leslie Cockburn, whose track record at "CBS Reports"
and PBS's "Frontline," was that of a committed left
ideologue. But the blame here must be spread more widely, as
Mrs. Cockburn worked here in close cooperation with executive
producer Tom Yellin and anchor Peter Jennings.
   Hanoi's leaders are hoping that a propaganda campaign by
their friends in the West will pressure Western governments
to accept the Phnom Penh regime. Hanoi's hopes were realized
in Britain after the screening of John Pilger's "Year 10" on
ITV. It hopes for as much from tonight's program at ABC.
