   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- American Savings Bank reported a
first-quarter net loss of $9.4 million, or $1.78 a share, and
directors voted to suspend the quarterly 20-cent-a-share
dividend.
   Earlier this month, the company had said it would post an
unspecified loss.

   The savings bank's first-quarter loss reflects factors
including an $11 million addition to reserves against
possible real estate loan losses. Those losses in turn
reflect a weak Northeast real estate market. The provision
includes a previously announced $4 million charge to
reacquire unsold shares in four residential cooperative
conversion projects.
   In the year-earlier period, the savings bank reported net
income of $6.6 million, or 88 cents a share. The dividend on
its cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred Series A
shares isn't affected by the suspension of the payout on
common.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American's shares fell 25 cents, to close at $2.75 each.
   The bank's AmSave commercial finance subsidiary also
placed a $15 million loan to West Point-Pepperell Inc.,
controlled by the investor William Farley, on non-accrual
status. Mr. Farley has been having some problems with the
financing for his acquisition of the West Point, Ga., textile
giant.
   The first-quarter provision for possible losses on loans
jumped to $13.3 million from $2 million a year ago. Income
from interest on loans before provision for loan losses fell
24% to $19.5 million, while the net interest margin -- the
difference between what the bank pays for funds and what it
takes in on loans -- narrowed to 2.05% from 2.46% a year ago.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, however, the margin was 1.99%.
   Nonperforming assets at March 31 grew to 4.65% of total
assets from 3.29% a year ago and 3.92% at Dec. 31. The bank's
regulatory capital was 6.81% of assets at March 31, compared
with the 6% required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Total assets dipped less than 1% to $4.41 billion from $4.43
billion at Dec. 31.
   American Savings put the AmSave unit up for sale two weeks
ago.
