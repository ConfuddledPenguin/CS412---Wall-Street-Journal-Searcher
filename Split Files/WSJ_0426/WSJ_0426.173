   The Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on
program traders who have exploited a regulatory loophole for
as long as four years.
   This week, the SEC warned big brokerage firms that engage
in computer-assisted program trading not to misinterpret the
limited exemption they enjoy to the stock market's
50-year-old "uptick rule." The 1986 exemption has been a sore
point among critics who say that program trading is hurting
the market.

   The ruling may curtail index arbitrage, a type of program
trading in which institutions buy or sell long lists of
stocks with offsetting trades in futures or options. Programs
involving New York stocks and Chicago futures seem likely to
be largely unaffected. The ruling's main impact will fall on
programs that involve foreign markets and are completed in
the U.S.
   The uptick rule prohibits short-selling -- a bet that a
stock will decline -- any time a stock is on a "downtick,"
meaning that its most recent price change was downward. But
the rule -- meant to keep manipulators from ganging up on an
already falling stock -- was never designed with program
traders and multiple-stock strategies in mind.
   It is understood that a major concern for the SEC is a
recently popular form of index arbitrage that starts with a
bearish investor selling a portfolio of stocks in London, and
ends with the brokerage firm who bought the stocks unloading,
or "unwinding," the batch of stocks in New York. Under the
new rule, the New York selling won't any longer enjoy the
uptick exemption.
   Blair Corkran, senior special counsel at the SEC, said the
agency acted in part because of confusion about the scope of
the 1986 uptick exemption. But the only significant change
now, he said, is that "the position is tightened in respect
to the unwinding of positions established overseas."
   The ruling is causing a stir at major program-trading
firms, which have been worried about the SEC's increased
focus on program trading in recent months. At Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., the biggest program trader on Wall Street, a
spokesman declined to comment yesterday.
   One vocal critic of program trading, the money management
firm of Neuberger &amp; Berman, says the exemption allows index
arbitragers to do "the equivalent of pressing the accelerator
of a runaway truck to the floor."
   Index arbs dispute that characterization; but the
exemption they have enjoyed is nonetheless important.
   The 1986 exemption was given to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. by the
SEC but applied to other firms. It was made because program
trading involves the simultaneous buying and selling of so
many stocks, such as all 500 issues in Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index. Strictly enforced, the uptick rule, designed
to protect individual stocks, might hamper legitimate
multistock trading by forcing brokerage firms to make sure
they aren't technically short-selling on a downtick any of
the hundreds of stocks involved in a program.
   In its new ruling, the SEC says "certain recurring issues
have arisen" that indicate that some index arbitragers aren't
following the letter of the law. "Since the time that the
1986 Letter was issued, the {SEC} has become aware that
market participants may be interpreting" the agency's
position "in contexts that were not contemplated by" the
SEC's market regulation division, the ruling states.
   W. James Tozer Jr., president and chief operating officer
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., told Congress recently
"there is concern on the Street" that much program trading
"is often technically in violation" of the uptick rule. "By
strictly enforcing the uptick rule, the SEC could slow the
downward spiraling process created by index arbitrage," he
said.
   The SEC emphasized that its uptick exemption was never
meant to apply to the creation of new index arbitrage
positions, but only to the unwinding of old ones. Also, it
applies only when both sides of an arbitage position are
being unwound simultaneously.
   The extra proviso about overseas-related positions was
needed, SEC staffers said, because such transactions weren't
commonplace when the original 1986 letter was written. But
these days, they are, and some traders are apparently making
an end-run around the uptick rule.
   One method of program trading, in particular, is targeted.
If for example, the Tokyo stock market fell heavily
overnight, a U.S. securities firm might expect the New York
Stock Exchange shares to react by dropping at the opening.
   So, the firm might suggest to a client that the market was
likely to fall and induce the client to sell it the 500
stocks in the S&amp;P 500 on the London market before the U.S.
opening. The Wall Street firm would hedge itself by selling
the S&amp;P 500 futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, a bet that the index is also going to fall.
   At the opening bell in New York, the firm would sell the
stocks on the Big Board, which would push stock prices down
and in turn nudge the futures lower as well. The firm would
likely make an easy profit by earning more money on selling
the futures than it might lose selling the stocks. Moreover,
the client would avoid a loss.
   "They help drive the market down, help push the market
over the cliff," said one SEC staffer.
   Under the uptick-rule exemption, the brokerage firm
selling the 500 stocks in New York supposedly must be
involved in unwinding an index arbitrage position. But the
brokerage firm that was selling the basket of stocks in the
above scenario wasn't actually unwinding a position; it was
simply selling stocks.
   "The point is: If the market were open in New York, you
couldn't do this. It's not bona fide arbitrage," said the SEC
staffer.
