   TORONTO -- The Canadian subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group reported a 46% drop in net income for the first quarter
from a year earlier.
   Shell Canada Ltd. reported net of 63 million Canadian
dollars (US$54.3 million) or 56 Canadian cents a share on
revenue of C$1.24 billion. In the first quarter of 1989, the
oil, gas and chemicals concern reported net of C$117 million
or C$1.04 a share, on revenue of C$1.22 billion.

   The bulk of the decline came from substantially reduced
earnings in Calgary-based Shell's chemical and downstream, or
refined, oil retailing divisions, the company said. Although
the company reported slightly increased earnings from its oil
and gas production division, it wasn't enough to offset the
declines in other sectors.
   John MacLeod, president and chief executive of Shell
Canada, said the company expects lower earnings throughout
1990 compared with last year. But he said, "we don't expect
to see the same degree of decline as we saw in the first
quarter of 1990."
   He declined to give a specific earnings estimate for the
year.
   Mr. MacLeod said Shell is taking steps to improve earnings
at the downstream oil products and retailing division. Among
the options the company is considering as part of a
restructuring are sales of some of the company's downstream
assets, including retail gas stations and outlets and assets.
   Donald Taylor, executive vice-president of Shell, declined
to elaborate on the planned restructuring, saying that a
company review of the assets is scheduled to be completed
next month.
   Mr. Taylor said that the downstream assets are generating
a return of only 4%, which he hopes a restructuring would
raise to about 8%.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Shell's Class A
shares closed at C$38 a share, unchanged.
