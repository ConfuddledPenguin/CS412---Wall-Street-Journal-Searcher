   Dear Dr. Sullivan:
   I'm sorry I can't be in the audience next month when you
give the commencement speech at Simpson College in Indianola,
Iowa. Indianola is just down the road from my home, and I've
had a long association with the college.
   It's a fine little school, Dr. Sullivan, marked by
handsome old buildings and even handsomer young Iowans. It
has been around for more than 125 years, and it takes pride
in the fact that 100 years ago this spring George Washington
Carver arrived on campus to seek his education. He spent a
couple of years there as a student before going up the road
to Iowa State.
   But it really isn't a noteworthy place. It has a thousand
or so students. (To put it in terms you deal with, Dr.
Sullivan: Its student body is about the same as the number of
Americans who die every day from smoking cigarettes.) It has
no huge endowment, like neighboring Grinnell College. It has
no great athletic prowess, like the state university in Iowa
City. It has no famous names on its faculty, no Rhodes
Scholars in its student body, not even a chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa. Rather, it's just a place where hard-working Iowans
send their sons and daughters to get a sound schooling, one
of a couple of dozen good but ordinary liberal-arts colleges
sprinkled across Iowa, a state that values education and
values its young people.
   And that's why I'm writing you, Dr. Sullivan. I don't know
what you plan to tell the 250 young men and women who will be
graduating, but I want to tell you a bit about the class.
About 92%, 232 members of the class, are from Iowa, and most
of those are from our farms and small towns. Their parents
are the backbone of the state, and if these young people
leave Iowa this state will be in trouble.
   So, Dr. Sullivan, please urge these youths to stay in
Iowa. Tell them the world is an exciting place, and urge them
to see it, as you have. But tell them, please, that they are
Iowans, that they are needed in the hometown, or at least the
home state, that there are opportunities here and that they
can make others of their own, and that, in fact, this is the
place many in the rest of the world are looking for -- a
pretty place with clean air and clear values, with natural
resources and unnatural harmony.
   Iowa will not prosper if its youths leave, and its youths
are leaving. We have more Iowans over 55 than under 15, more
over 75 than under five. Iowa gives the world Maytag washing
machines and John Deere tractors and Winnebago vehicles --
and hard-working, well-educated, ambitious young college
graduates. Educated young people are a major export of the
state. In the 1980s, some 200,000 more people left Iowa than
moved to it.
   If these smart young people would stay here -- or settle
here after seeing the bright lights elsewhere -- this state
would grow and prosper as never before. For Iowans have a lot
to offer. Just ask Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Mr. Gorbachev has asked my friend John Chrystal, a farmer
and banker and economist (and, now, gubernatorial candidate)
from Coon Rapids, to send him some Iowans to do no less than
transform the Soviet agricultural economy. Mr. Gorbachev
wants Mr. Chrystal to find 2,000 Iowans -- 1,000 two-person
teams -- willing to spend two years in the Soviet Union
teaching the Russians about agriculture and what Iowans now
call agri-industry. That's right. Mr. Gorbachev is a longtime
friend of the Iowa farmer, and now the Soviet leader has
turned to Iowans to help him reform and revitalize his
nation.
   That's a wonderful thing, for lots of reasons, and I hope
Mr. Chrystal will take on the task. It could help bring
stability to Russia and prosperity to Iowa -- the Russians
would buy all kinds of Iowa-made equipment as part of the
deal, Mr. Chrystal says.
   But it's the message that's most important: If the Soviet
Union thinks 2,000 Iowans can change a nation, think what
this year's 250 graduates of Simpson -- and the thousands of
other young Iowans who will be getting diplomas this spring
-- can do for this state. With brains and brawn, they can
transform a state that already has an abundance of natural
resources -- clear water and clean air and rich soil -- and
good roads and rivers and parks and schools into a thriving
land.
   So that's my request, Dr. Sullivan. Tell these young
Iowans to take pride in their state and their heritage. Ask
them to give back to the state and the communities that have
given them so much -- given them strong values and a sturdy
education. Tell them the world is a wonderful place and urge
them to see it. But tell them that when it comes time to
settle down, to settle down in Iowa.
   One other suggestion, Dr. Sullivan: Keep it short.
   Best wishes,
   Michael Gartner
