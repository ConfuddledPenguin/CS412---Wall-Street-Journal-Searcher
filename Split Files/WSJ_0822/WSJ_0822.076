   The streets outside the South African embassies are empty.
The Western anti-apartheid groups are quiet. Meanwhile, blood
flows by the bucketful in South Africa.
   Somehow, the struggle isn't very romantic anymore. Over
the weekend, Zulus with AK-47s raided a Xhosa hostel and
killed at least 21 people. Many were shot while they slept.
The Xhosa-dominated ANC gangs have been equally brutal.
They've also continued their campaign of liquidating
moderates.

   On Sunday, Soweto town councilor T.A. Nkina was deemed
insufficiently radical by some ANC soldiers, who surrounded
his house. He called police but by the time they arrived, he
was dead, his throat slit. More than 4,000 people have died
in tribal warfare over the past three years, 363 alone last
week.
   We have suggested in the past that the anti-apartheid
struggle isn't merely a U.S.-style civil-rights campaign on
different shores. In a July 1985 editorial, we argued that
Lebanon is a more accurate model for understanding South
Africa: "South Africa is less a cohesive nation than a
landscape of many rival factions living under an uneasy
truce. Despite the evil of apartheid, the lines of division
do not fall neatly between white and black. Rather, the
divisions run like cuts in a huge jigsaw puzzle."
   South Africa, we pointed out, has four major and 23 minor
languages. The largest group, the Zulus, consists of about
200 tribes. There are 11 other black ethnic groups. The
second largest is the Xhosa. Nelson Mandela and his wife,
Winnie, come from aristocratic Xhosa families.
   We kept repeating these facts because the sanctions and
divestment groups refused to acknowledge them. Western
anti-apartheid activism became fixated with the moral
superiority of their stance. The activists were drawn to the
most romantic and radical of the anti-apartheid groups, the
ANC.
   Meanwhile, the activists heaped scorn upon the Zulu-led
Inkatha movement, with 1.7 million members. Inkatha is
equally fervent in its opposition to apartheid, but it favors
free markets and opposes sanctions. The ANC strategy is to
isolate and discredit Chief Buthelezi, before he can turn
Inkatha into a nationwide political party. Last month, three
ANC guerrillas were arrested and accused of plotting to
assassinate senior Inkatha leaders.
   Mr. Buthelezi is not the only black leader who worries
that the ANC wants to completely dominate black politics.
Major black nationalist groups, including the Pan-Africanist
Congress, Azapo and the National Council of Trade Unions,
recently opposed an ANC-called strike.
   Last month, Sam Mabe, an editor of South Africa's largest
black newspaper, the Sowetan, was gunned down. Nothing was
stolen, and his friends say the murder was political. Mr.
Mabe was a leader in the Nation Building Campaign, which
wants blacks to build up their economic power and not focus
solely on gaining political power. On a visit to the U.S.
last year, Mr. Mabe, a former leader of the Black Media
Workers Association, told us many ANC members opposed a black
free press and had often tried to intimidate him.
   So far, the ANC has successfully excluded Inkatha and
other black groups from the negotiations with the white
government. The ANC's friends in the West never encouraged
the group to acknowledge Inkatha's legitimacy. Western
supporters of the ANC thus became opponents of political
pluralism. Instead, they loaded up the entire outcome of the
complex South African equation on the fortunes of one group,
the ANC.
   Civil war was the predictable (and predicted) result. Now
there are voices on the South African left calling for talks
between Inkatha and the ANC. But far away, in the U.S. and in
Europe, South Africa no longer fits into domestic political
agendas. To those who had so many blunt solutions for South
Africa, it seems fair to ask, what now? Any recommendations?
