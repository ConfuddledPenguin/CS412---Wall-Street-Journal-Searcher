   New Devices on Line
   To Slow Down Speeders

   SPEED-DEMONS beware: The police are working up an arsenal
of new weapons to nab you.
   New radar-detector detectors have made their national
debut along Virginia's Interstate 95. The devices, pioneered
by Ontario police, pick up microwave signals emitted by radar
detectors. Besides Virginia, fuzz-busters are illegal in
Connecticut and the District of Columbia. A New York ban on
detectors in big trucks took effect Sunday. And the federal
government is considering a nationwide ban on detectors in
trucks.
   Meanwhile, a laser speed-tracking device is being
perfected. More precise than conventional radar, it can't be
sniffed out by radar detectors. Such new enforcement weapons
raise hopes that the "era of the radar detector is coming to
an end," says Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.
   Another new technology is photo-radar, which snaps
pictures of speeding cars' license plates. Officials in
Paradise Valley, Ariz., where the system is being used, say
that crashes have declined. The system is also being used in
Pasadena, Calif. Photo-radar will be tested on Washington's
Capital Beltway this fall, despite some grumbling about its
Big Brother overtones.
   The anti-speed offensive comes amid rising worries over a
steadily accelerating populace. "Speeds are increasing every
year," frets Clayton Hall, director of the Office of
Enforcement and Emergency Services, National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. "Compliance has gone downhill."
   Evidence mounts that speed kills: A new insurance
institute study concludes that raising the speed limit to 65
miles per hour on rural interstate highways resulted in 33%
more deaths last year than the average for 1982-1986, when
the limit was 55 mph.
                                                                                                       

   Air-Travel Taxes Head
   For the Stratosphere
                                                                                                       

   AS IF AIRLINE fuel surcharges aren't bad enough, Uncle Sam
wants to attach an array of taxes and "user fees" to airline
tickets.
   Travelers on international flights already shell out $16
in U.S. departure taxes, customs and immigration-service fees
and an additional $10 in airline-security surcharges.
   Recently, the Senate approved a Bush administration
proposal to slap an additional $1 to $3 on arriving
international passengers to pay for inspections of plants and
animals brought into the U.S. The House passed legislation to
allow airports to impose long-banned departure taxes that
could add up to $9 on round-trip international tickets and
$12 on domestic ones. Domestic travelers face a proposed
ticket-tax increase to 10% from 8%. Some of these fees appear
doomed politically, but others may be adopted to ease the
budget crisis.
   The airlines gripe that passengers are being used as a
cash cow and that the $7 billion aviation trust-fund surplus
should be spent before new fees are imposed. But they are
pushing a plan that probably would result in a new $3
surcharge on international tickets sold in the U.S. to help
pay for higher compensation to victims of international air
disasters. The plan would implement the Montreal Protocols, a
pact pending before the Senate.
                                                                                                       

   Pilots Are Encouraged
   To Sleep on the Job
                                                                                                       

   SO YOU'VE caught a glimpse of the captain snoozing in the
cockpit. Relax, catnaps during long flights enhance safety.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is using a new study
to encourage United and Northwest airlines to institute
"controlled napping" on trans-Pacific flights with three crew
members. "Clearly it can be very effective," says Anthony
Broderick, an FAA associate administrator.
   The action is prompted by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Ames Research Center, which found that
naps leave pilots refreshed and ready to juggle the tricky
tasks involved in descent and landing.
   Unplanned sleeping hasn't been blamed for any U.S. airline
accident. But pilot drowsiness, caused by boredom and
frequent time changes, appears to be a significant safety
hazard, says Mark Rosekind, a scientist at NASA Ames.
   Exhausted pilots, in reports to Ames's confidential
air-safety hot line, have confessed to flying at the wrong
altitude, landing on the wrong runway and slapping their
faces during landings to avoid nodding off. There are even
occasional reports of all three pilots falling asleep, says
H. Clayton Foushee, a top FAA scientist.
   The problem is so severe, experts say, that some flight
crews currently take turns sleeping, even though they could
be accused of recklessness under FAA rules.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MEMBERS of National Car Rental's Emerald Club, which
offers free-rental coupons to frequent customers, may have a
tough time redeeming their coupons in Manhattan until after
Labor Day. The company, which has a disclaimer on the
coupons, has imposed "capacity controls" for the area similar
to those on airline frequent flyer programs. . . . The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that
some emergency workers have been alarmed by the dust emitted
by air bags in crashes and have used elaborate rescue
procedures for hazardous-materials accidents. "Such measures
are unnecessary and can endanger crash victims if they lead
to a delay in medical assistance," warns NHTSA chief Jerry
Curry. The dust is cornstarch or talcum powder, used to keep
the air bag's fabric from sticking to itself during
deployment.
