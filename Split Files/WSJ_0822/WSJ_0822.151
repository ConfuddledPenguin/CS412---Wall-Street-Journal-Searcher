   Your reporter, in attaching an account of my recent
appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to an
unrelated story about a former White House aide and the
Senate Judiciary Committee, got my testimony wrong ("Reagan,
Bush Ex-Aide Gets S&amp;L Subpoena," July 30). My subject was an
Office of Management and Budget decision not to authorize a
higher ceiling for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's hiring
of bank examiners for S&amp;Ls in the mid-1980s. I testified that
the OMB decision not to raise the ceiling stemmed from the
Bank Board's inability, over a period of years, to hire even
as many examiners as its ceiling already afforded. This is
established in detail in the record of the 2 1/2-hour
hearing. In fact, the real reason the board couldn't get more
examiners was that, by statute, not OMB decision, government
pay was not competitive.
   I did not "acknowledge," as your reporter writes, that
"ideology" was the basis for this decision. Once again, as
the hearing record makes plain, I merely explained that given
presidential policy to constrain the growth of the federal
work force, the burden of justification for increases rested
with the agency head. The Bank Board could hardly make a case
for a higher ceiling when it was chronically unable to hire
at the already authorized ceiling. The words "ideology" and
"acknowledge" used by your reporter reveal only his own
ideological preconception and his apparent desire to make a
personal political point -- that, somehow, it was Reagan
policy, not statutory federal pay levels, that made it hard
for the Bank Board to get the examiners it wanted.
