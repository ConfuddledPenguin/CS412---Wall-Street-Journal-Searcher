   DALLAS -- Integra-A Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co., severely
strapped for cash, said it hired out the management of 24
properties in an attempt to cut costs and avoid a more
drastic step, such as bankruptcy.
   By hiring Westbrooke Services Corp. to manage 24 of the 31
hotels owned and/or operated by Integra, the company said it
will realize "a major reduction in overhead costs." David
Steadman, chief executive officer, said that such a reduction
was needed to help the company stay afloat.

   "The company does have liquidity problems, and one of the
first things we have to do is achieve some reduction in
costs," said Mr. Steadman. With the Westbrooke agreement, "we
have done that," he said. He declined to specify the cost
reductions expected to result from the Westbrooke agreement.
   "As to the future, there are a variety of ways of
restructuring a company, and one is through a bankruptcy
filing," he said. "We would prefer not to do that, but we
would if we had to." Other possible solutions to Integra's
liquidity problems include mergers, divestitures and joint
ventures, the company said.
   In the year ended Dec. 29, Integra posted a loss of $12.7
million, or $1.48 a share, on revenue of $91.3 million. In
the first six months of this year, the company posted a net
loss of $3.2 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of
about $44 million.
   Under their agreement, Westbrooke will provide management,
accounting and consulting services at the 24 Integra
properties, which are currently experiencing an "aggregate
break-even cash flow." The agreement is structured so that
Westbrooke's fees will rise with cash-flow improvements.
