   Circle K Corp., which is operating under bankruptcy law
protection, said it expects to close 201 stores, or about 4%
of its 4,631 stores, by the end of the month.
   A spokesman said in Phoenix, Ariz., that cost savings
figures related to the closures weren't available but would
be "substantial." More store closings may come later, but
"this appears to be the brunt of it."

   Circle K, one of the nation's largest convenience-store
operators, ran into trouble earlier this year after expanding
too quickly and taking on more than $1 billion in
below-investment-grade debt to buy and open additional
stores.
   The stores being closed are in 21 of the 32 states where
Circle K operates. Fortythree of the stores are in Texas and
29 in California. Most of the 1,600 employees affected by the
closures will be moved to other stores, the spokesman said.
