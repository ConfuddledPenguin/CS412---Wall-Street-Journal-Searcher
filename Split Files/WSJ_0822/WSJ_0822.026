   NANTUCKET, Mass. -- It's a great place to bring the kids.
Around election time, politicians hand out leaflets here.
It's got the best antique deals around, and the view is as
pretty as any you'll find on this resort island. As deer
nibble serenely on the hillsides, a thousand seagulls rise up
as one, then fall back in harmonious waves.
   Greetings from the Nantucket dump.

   For about 60 years, this town dump has served as community
center, trading post and party hall. Although many Nantucket
residents pay commercial haulers to collect their trash,
others do as their forebears did: toss their own eggshells
and milk cartons onto the rank slopes of garbage mountain.
Then they pick through their neighbors' rubble --
"antiquing," as they say -- and swap some gossip.
   Now this dump's days are numbered. Like many others across
the country, Nantucket's dump is dangerously old and nearly
full. Within the next few years, it will close its gates,
supplanted by the modern technology of solid waste
management. Many residents will be sorry to see the old dump
go.
   "The average working guy just wants to go in there with
his chain saw and pick up a few things, try to save a buck,"
says Harry "Bud" Clute, the county sheriff.
   Nantucket is hardly alone in having a garbage problem. But
it feels its predicament more acutely than most. Little more
than a large sandbar 30 miles east of Cape Cod, Nantucket
can't cheaply truck its garbage to another site. With its
land selling for an average of $110,000 an acre, the tiny
island is loath to eat up property for a new landfill.
Incineration, which needs a steady flow of garbage, is
impractical for a place where the summer population is almost
six times the year-round population of 6,900. Worst of all,
the island sits atop its own drinking water, making any
leakage from the dump a very serious affair.
   "It's a ticking timebomb," says Jeff Willett,
superintendent of the town's department of public works.
   No one knows what's at the bottom of the Nantucket dump,
which opened in a tarpit sometime around 1930. Ever since the
island's whale-based economy crashed in the mid-19th century,
Nantucket has depended on tourists and fish for its survival,
thus generating almost no industrial waste. But until the
mid-1960s, when the dump was reorganized, separating scrap
metal, tires and hazardous substances from other kinds of
garbage, everything was lobbed into the pit -- car batteries,
dry cleaning fluid, photo lab chemicals and lead. "A chemical
stew," Mr. Willett calls it.
   Monitoring wells set up around the dump show some leakage
into the ground water. But so far the contamination hasn't
spread.
   In the early days of the Nantucket dump, no kitchen
garbage was accepted; that was picked up at people's homes by
trash collectors, who cooked it and fed it to their pigs.
Everything else was scavenged or burned. Andrew Lewis, who
ran the dump from 1945 until the mid-1960s, said he only
needed two things to do his job: a pitchfork and a pack of
matches. Later, he added a wheelbarrow.
   Before he put match to trash, however, Mr. Lewis, known
around town as "Mr. Dump" and his wife as "Mrs. Dump,"
separated the copper, brass, rags and newspaper. He sold some
of it to a New Bedford, Mass., junk dealer he knew from his
rumrunning days. He decorated his home with some of the rest.
   "I'd give hell to people who tried to take my copper or
brass," says Mr. Lewis, now 78 years old. "If anyone bothered
me -- well, I was my own boss." Mr. Lewis still visits the
dump every morning when it opens. "It's beautiful scenery,"
he says. He proudly displays an oil painting of the Nantucket
dump, done by local artists while he was caretaker. "I think
they just painted those flowers in," he says. "But they
captured the shed pretty good."
   During winters past, after the dump was closed and the
caretaker had gone home, Nantucket men would gather to shoot
rats with .22 rifles. The men would sit in their cars with
their lights out. Suddenly they would all flash on their
headlights and blast away.
   The caretaker of the dump has always occupied a position
of some prominence around Nantucket. Before Mr. Lewis was one
"Dumpy" Ray, who, with his long beard, stovepipe hat and
floor-length coat, cut a bizarre figure around town before
World War I. Mr. Ray came to a bad end, or so the story goes,
when an inebriated bully shouted at him, "If I catch sight of
you again, I'm goin' to kill you." Supposedly, Dumpy Ray fled
to his attic, where he spent the next 15 years quaking in
terror.
   Today it takes three full-time employees and an impressive
array of heavy machinery to care for the growing dump 00 now
seven acres, and 45-feet tall. Honey Seidler runs the Rex
Steel-Wheeled Trash Masher, 12-foot blades on wheels. "I love
my Rex," Ms. Seidler says. Ms. Seidler and Jim Hastings, who
operates the Wheeled Trojan Bucket Loader, perform a garbage
pas de deux with their machines, turning mounds of loose
garbage into a tight-packed floor. Even so, the garbage
mountain has grown so tall that it is within a few feet of
becoming the island's highest point.
   Compared to most dumps, Nantucket has a relatively clean
"waste stream," the new name for garbage. Although the resort
island's dump receives a disproportionate number of junked
bicycles, patio chairs and outboard motors, there's little
medical waste, few hazardous substances and, because of the
island's 60 or so restaurants, lots of food. A fledging
recycling program has begun sending glass, plastic, metal and
paper off the island.
   Despite all this, the dump is technically not sanitary.
Although the dump is officially called a landfill, it doesn't
have an impervious lining nor is it covered daily -- two
things a dump needs to become a sanitary landfill. Like many
dumps, Nantucket's is technically operating in violation of
state law, but it can't shut until the island has found
another site. For the past several years, town officials have
been studying garbage alternatives, hiring consultants,
forming and disbanding committees. In 1987, the town finally
settled on the idea of building a composting plant, a
disposal method that, though popular in Europe, has had a
troubled history in the U.S.
   Composting is costly, and the market for the product is
small. Building and operating Nantucket's plant will cost
more than shipping the island's garbage to a landfill "in
America," as the natives call the mainland, but few on the
island could stomach the idea of putting their junk in
someone else's backyard. "On an island, you can't just walk
over the next hill," says Mr. Willett. "People realize this
is a finite area, and they have to protect it."
   For now, it's still open season at the dump. "I'm doing
the inside of my house, and all of the wood came from here,"
says Neville Richen, a town employee and occasional dump
picker. "My gutters and my downspouts came from here." Ms.
Seidler claims she has picked up "half a dozen fur coats" at
the dump. Mr. Clute salvages old bedsprings and turns them
into angle irons. Mr. Lewis once dug a restaurant's cash
receipts out of an old washing machine, returned the bills
and pocketed the silver.
   There's not much a person can't find at the Nantucket
dump. "On Nantucket," says Ms. Seidler, "everything that
doesn't go to the graveyard comes to the dump."
