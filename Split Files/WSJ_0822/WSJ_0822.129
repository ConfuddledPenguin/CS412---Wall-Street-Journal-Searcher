   Private investor James A. Mactier increased his stake in
Oglebay Norton Co. to 5.1% of the Cleveland-based raw
materials and shipping concern.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Mactier said recent purchases of 57,600 shares, added to
his previous holding of 73,200 shares, increase his total
holding to 130,800 shares. The investor said the purchases
were for investment reasons. He declined comment through his
lawyer, John C. Hewitt.

spoken with Mr. Mactier, but it is not concerned about any
takeover possibilities "at this point."
   The spokesman also said that John D. Weil, a private St.
Louis investor, had recently increased his stake to 5.3%. He
noted that there is no known connection between the two
investors.
