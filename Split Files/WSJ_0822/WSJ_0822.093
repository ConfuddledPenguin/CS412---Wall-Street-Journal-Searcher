   It May Be Too Late for the Fed to Ease

   The Federal Reserve System almost always finds itself in
some sort of box. Some people will want the central bank to
ease money while others will urge it to tighten up. Usually,
the Fed finds a way to work itself out of such trouble. This
time, however, it may have waited too long.
   Until March, things seemed to be going fairly well. The
economy had slowed, but recession forecasts were few. The
Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of academic and
business economists often critical of the Fed, said at its
semiannual meeting, "Monetary policy remains consistent with
moderate recovery and declining inflation." That's about as
nice a comment as it ever makes about the Fed.

   But things soon began to change, and not really for the
better. Nearly everyone realized that the 8.2% spurt of the
consumer price index in the first quarter, on an annual-rate
basis, was a temporary phenomenon, produced by cold-weather
increases in food and energy costs. These factors faded in
the second quarter, but new price difficulties arose. Labor
costs, which had been unusually quiet through the long
business expansion, were climbing. Even before the Mideast
crisis sent oil prices soaring, analysts were predicting
rising inflation the rest of this year.
   So far, that looks like a good forecast. As the real
Federal Open Market Committee met yesterday, it had to ponder
that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of close to 5% in
July -- when energy prices were falling. That compared with a
3.8% rise for the full second quarter.
   Ordinarily, the Fed's next move would seem automatic.
Inflationary pressures are growing, so the inflation-hating
Fed tightens up, right? Not necessarily.
   Administration officials for weeks have been reminding the
Federal Reserve that it has some responsibility for the
health of the economy. The rise in the inflation-adjusted
gross national product slowed to an annual rate of 1.2%, and
the Mideast oil shock has increased talk of recession.
Treasury Secretary Brady and other officials argue that the
Fed should cut the federal funds rate, the fee charged on
short-term loans of bank reserves.
   The Fed had been expected to reward the administration and
Congress for a budget-deficit cut by reducing the funds rate.
But the deficit cut, never anything like a sure thing, now
seems even more unlikely in the wake of the Mideast military
buildup. So the funds rate has been allowed to edge downward
by only a quarter-point in the face of the weakening economy.
   It was a difficult exercise, not without its ridiculous
aspects. The Federal Reserve uses the funds rate to signal
its monetary policy. The funds rate does have some influence
on other short-term rates, but its influence on long rates is
limited. But as the economy has weakened in recent weeks,
short-term rates have tended to decline. To keep the funds
rate from declining more than the Fed wanted, the central
bank has had to pull reserves out of the banking system.
   Got that? The Fed has not only been resisting pressures to
ease by reducing the funds rate, but it has moved in the
opposite direction by tightening bank reserves.
   That leads to the Federal Reserve's current unhappy
situation. The central bank can't move against the increased
inflationary pressures without, in all probability,
triggering a recession. If the Fed, instead, moves
significantly to spur the sagging economy, the bond market
and analysts generally will assume the Federal Reserve has
caved in to administration pressure and inflation will take
off.
   Is there anything the Fed could have done to avert this
debacle? It could have paid more attention to bank reserves.
Reserves have been flat-to-declining all this year. Talk
about credit crunches; without reserves, banks don't make
loans. The Fed should have permitted reserves to grow
steadily at a modest rate, accepting cheerfully any federal
funds rate declines that went along with such a policy.
   What should the Fed do now? If it chooses to ease, the
inflationary pressures increase. If it chooses to tighten,
the recessionary pressures increase.
   Easing, of course, offers no guarantee of avoiding
recession. It may merely ensure that inflation will rise so
high that everyone will find it intolerable. The result could
be a deep recession like 1981-82.
   Similarly, tightening is not a perfect solution. The
Federal Reserve presumably would prefer to move gradually,
with the result that the recession's anti-inflation benefits
will be delayed. In 1981 gradualism was urged on Paul
Volcker, then chairman of the Fed, as a cure for double-digit
inflation. Mr. Volcker decided gradualism wouldn't work and
moved quickly. History could repeat itself.
   The best bet is that the Fed will mark time, hoping for
some development in the domestic economy that will make the
appropriate action more readily visible. Monetary policy in
the next few weeks is likely to be shaped by events, not by
new Fed policy. There are times when nothing is the best
thing a government agency can do.
   There's no telling what those events might be. Real war in
the Mideast might make the recession worries disappear in an
inflationary blur. Congress might return from vacation,
notice that the Fed hadn't moved, and take a small step
toward budget control, even in the midst of the Mideast
situation.
   One thing is certain. As a Federal Reserve economist said
privately last week, "We should keep a closer watch on bank
reserves." It would have been nice if that thought had
occurred to someone three or four months ago.
