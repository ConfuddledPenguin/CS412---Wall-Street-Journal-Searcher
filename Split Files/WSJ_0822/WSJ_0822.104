   Apparently Have Escaped Detection

   There may be close to 2,500 U.S. citizens trapped in
Kuwait, but a number of the Americans appear to have stayed
out of the hands of the Iraqis so far, many with the help of
a friendly populace.
   The State Department, which has estimated that there are
about 11,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait, said yesterday
that one more American and eight British citizens were seized
by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, reportedly after a Kuwaiti man
was forced at gunpoint to identify homes of Westerners. That
action increased the number of Americans held hostage by Iraq
to 54, according to the department.

   While it is difficult to confirm the whereabouts of the
foreigners caught up in the crisis, several American
companies said their employees haven't been seized.
   Asea Brown Boveri Inc., an engineering firm based in
Stamford, Conn., said it has about a half dozen American
employees in Kuwait and Iraq. None have left, and a
spokeswoman said the company is in "regular communication"
with them. Lockheed Corp., of Los Angeles, said it has three
American employees still safe, at least as of earlier this
week, when the company received a fax transmission that said
they were safe and still in Kuwait.
   Chevron Corp. said two of its chemical engineers were
trapped in Kuwait while working on a refinery near Kuwait
City. They haven't been heard from since the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion. The State Department told Chevron that the two
weren't among 28 Americans transported to Baghdad.
   Turner International Inc., an international general
contractor based in New York, has several employees at large
in Kuwait, and the company was indirectly in contact with
them as late as Saturday. "We heard that they were OK and
they were laying low," said Nick Billotti, the company's
director of international business. "They are keeping a very
low profile."
   It is hard to estimate how many Americans remain in
Kuwait, partly because the State Department seems to be
advising most American companies to make no public
acknowledgment of any operations or employees in that
country. For instance, Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass., won't
even confirm the existence of its Raytheon Gulf Systems Co.
of Kuwait.
   "With the turbulent situation in the Middle East, we're
not going to talk about it," said Walter Palmer, head of
Raytheon's public relations.
   Bechtel Group Inc., the giant San Francisco general
contractor, is believed to be the largest American employer
in the Middle East. While Bechtel won't say exactly how many
Americans it employs in the region, it had 1,200 people of
all nationalities -- including dependents -- before the
invasion; that number has been reduced to about 900
currently. The company hasn't had offices in either Iraq or
Kuwait for at least a year, but it declined to say whether
any of its workers were in the two countries when the
invasion took place. A spokesman would only say: "We're in
contact with all of our people."
   Another big contractor, Ralph M. Parsons Co., Pasadena,
Calif., has 12 employees and eight of their relatives in
Kuwait. They were working on a waste-water treatment plant, a
power plant and highways. As of last week, they were believed
to be safely out of Iraqi hands.
   So far, the company with the largest contingent held by
Iraq is Santa Fe International Inc., the big oil drilling and
rig equipment operator. Eight of its oil field workers were
taken to Baghdad from Kuwait after the invasion, and the
company hasn't had contact with them since.
   Relatives of the Americans in Kuwait, while all anguished,
are divided over whether their predicament should deter
military action by the U.S. "Providing the Americans are out,
I would be for it, but my son is in Kuwait City," said Emily
Abramson of Southbury, Conn., whose son is an architect
working for a private Kuwaiti firm. She opposes military
action until all Americans are out of Kuwait. The State
Department told her that as of Aug. 16 her son was still
free.
   The Rev. Edwin Davis of Koran, La., whose daughter and two
grandchildren were trapped in Kuwait while visiting in-laws,
said, "I'd hate for {the U.S.} to start something and I don't
think they will." He hasn't heard from his daughter since
Aug. 2. If the Americans could be evacuated, "I wouldn't
care, let 'em fight. Let 'em clean that bunch out."
   Betty Seago, whose husband, Guy, maintains radar equipment
for the Kuwaitis, said, "I stand behind the government. Of
course you love your family and all, but I would have to
stand behind it. It's not in my hands." Mr. Seago's
whereabouts are unknown.
