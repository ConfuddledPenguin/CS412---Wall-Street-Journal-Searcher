   Even a rebound from a steep morning decline couldn't
inspire much positive comment about the over-the-counter
stock market yesterday.
   Traders noted that the OTC's major index regained about
25% of its first-hour loss, but found little reason for
optimism in the face of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 8.91, or 2.3% and closed
at 379.68, its third consecutive loss. The index had fallen
about 13 points before a late morning rally.
   At the opening bell, OTC stocks followed the Big Board
lower, recording major losses in the first hour of trading.
Both rallied at midday. But while the listed stocks fell in
the afternoon, OTC stocks eased higher.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index closed 1.9%
lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 52.48, a 2%
loss.
   Traders are at a loss to explain the upward creep of the
OTC market in the afternoon while Big Board stocks languished
lower.
   John Schraff, an equities trader for Daiwa Securities
America, suggests it may be merely a matter of timing.
   "Secondary issues were beat up a lot worse," Mr. Schraff
says. "They may be seeing their bottoms at different times."
   At Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, William Rothe, managing director of
equity trading, saw some short-covering in OTC issues and a
few investors picking up a rare bargain.
   "The mood still remains cautious," Mr. Rothe says. "It
will take good news out of the Middle East to get some form
of technical rally."
   Volume increased dramatically to 166.4 million shares from
Monday's paltry 115.5 million shares. Decliners led advancing
issues 1,747 to 458.
   MCI Communications was by far the most active OTC issue.
MCI traded 3.7 million shares, nearly double its daily
average of 2.1 million shares.
   Much of the interest in MCI began with its morning
announcement that it might write off about $500 million in
the third quarter to convert its analog systems to digital.
MCI also said it would spend about $1.1 billion in 1991 on
the conversion.
   The market sent MCI about two points lower at the outset.
By afternoon, investors began buying and nearly cut MCI's
decline in half. It finished the day at 33 5/8, down 1 1/8.
   Gaining issues weren't easy to find on the closing tape.
But late shopping in some technology issues pushed Novell 1
5/8 higher to 22 3/4 and Oracle Systems 1/8 higher to 13 5/8.
Sun Microsystems reversed early losses to end unchanged at
26.
   Alex. Brown's Mr. Rothe suggests that investors looking
for selective opportunities may be scouring the roles of the
battered technology issues for a bargain or two.
   Of course, not all technology stocks avoided declines.
Intel lost 1 to 32 1/4. Apple Computer fell 1/2 to 36 1/4.
Microsoft also rebounded from early lows but still closed 1
1/4 lower at 54 1/4.
   Cellular stocks suffered too. McCaw Cellular declined 1/2
to 18 3/4. LIN Broadcasting fell 1 5/8 to 57. Contel Cellular
was down 1 3/4 to 14. Nationwide Cellular Service stumbled 1
to close at 4 3/4.
   Big losses were abundant in virtually every OTC sector.
Two athletic-shoe makers fell drastically. Nike was off 5 7/8
to 67 3/8 while K-Swiss lost 1 3/4 to 18 1/2. The British
information and trading systems giant, Reuters, gave up
ground again, dropping another 2 points to close at 44 3/4.
And International Lease Finance dropped 1 1/2 to 27 1/2.
   Brand was down 1 1/2 to 13 1/4. Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report said the company told analysts its third
quarter earnings might be lower than expected.
   Cetus fell 1 1/8 to 7 1/2. The New York Times reported the
company is in trouble following management changes, layoffs
and Food and Drug Administration questions about its most
important product, interleukin-2.
   Stuart Hall reported it was negotiating with an investor
group to sell a 7% stake in the company. Stuart Hall said the
investor group might be interested in acquiring the entire
company eventually. Stuart Hall shares rose 5/8 to 10 5/8.
   Prospect Group traded more than 10 times its average daily
volume as the company began distribution of its assets as it
liquidates. Prospect Group shareholders will receive both
cash and the stock of subsidiaries. The company's shares fell
5/8 to 2 1/8 on 1.6 million shares.
   Buy-backs brought disparate responses.
   Dionex shares were 1/8 lower at 18 7/8 despite the
company's announcement that it would buy back as many as one
million of its 8.9 million common shares.
   Andrew added 3/4 to close at 18 on news the company would
repurchase one million of its 10.2 million common shares
outstanding.
