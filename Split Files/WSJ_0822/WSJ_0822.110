   Charter Medical Corp., Macon, Ga., said it was advised by
the Securities and Exchange Commission that the agency plans
to review Charter's 1988 management-led leveraged buy-out.
   No Charter executives have been interviewed by the SEC and
no documents have been requested, according to J. Rodney
Laughlin, an executive vice president of the psychiatric and
general hospital concern. "It's so preliminary, I don't know
what they'll be reviewing," he said.

   SEC officials couldn't be reached.
   In recent months, Charter has been struggling under $1.6
billion in debt from the buy-out. The company has been
cutting costs, by reducing personnel, among other measures.
