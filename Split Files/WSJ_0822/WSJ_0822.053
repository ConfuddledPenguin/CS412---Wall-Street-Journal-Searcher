   Readers should not be put off by the title, "Why Blacks,
Women, and Jews Are Not Mentioned in the Constitution, and
Other Unorthodox Views" (American Enterprise Institute,
Washington, D.C., 182 pages, $16.95), by Robert A. Goldwin.
The book is not racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, flippant or
strident. Mr. Goldwin was the primary organizer of the
decade-long Constitution Project of the American Enterprise
Institute, where he is a resident scholar. He is basically a
philosopher with a deep interest in what he calls the
"American founding principles." This book is a collection of
his articles and addresses dealing with a variety of
subjects, including the Constitution, American education and
the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty. His ideas are
venturesome, and inevitably of the kind to provoke debate.
Many points are of enormous value, but in the debate about
some, I would be on the opposing team.
   The essay from which the book's title is drawn deals in
part with the ever-recurring attack on the authors of the
Constitution for not immediately putting an end to slavery.
During the recent 200th anniversary, some commentators spoke
with particular bitterness of the provision (Art. I, Sec. 2)
that a state's allotment of members in the House shall be
determined by the number of "free Persons" plus "three-fifths
of all other Persons" (meaning slaves). The Founding Fathers,
it is said, viewed the Negro slave as less than human and
expressed this in cold arithmetic.

   Mr. Goldwin's thesis is sharply different. He argues that
the three-fifths clause had nothing to do with characterizing
blacks in demeaning terms. The issue was not the relative
worth of individuals but the relative power of Northern and
Southern states in Congress. The Southern states were the
ones who argued for counting the full number of slaves on an
equal basis with the whites. It was the delegates from the
Northern states who wanted to count the slaves as less than
the whites, and indeed urged that they should not be counted
at all. A compromise was reached in the three-fifths
provision.
   Although the subject of slavery was dealt with in the
Constitution, the word "slave" or "slavery" was never
actually used. There was nothing in the Constitution that
perpetuated slavery, and when abolition finally came, it was
the laws and practices of certain states that needed to be
changed, not the Constitution.
   A number of other interesting themes are pursued in the
author's remaining essays on the Constitution. He contrasts
the extravagant catalog of "human rights" appearing in many
modern constitutions with the brief list of basics in our
Bill of Rights. The current tendency is to guarantee such
things as adequate diet, housing, health care, recreation and
culture. But these "guarantees" are usually fraud or folly.
For people dying of malnutrition, the question is not whether
they have the right, but how to get food to them.
   Mr. Goldwin ponders with great insight the reasons for the
American Constitution's success and longevity. By now about
160 other countries have such governing instruments, but
their replacement rate is very high. The American
Constitution (capital "C") was drafted to correspond with the
American constitution (small "c"), meaning the people's
character, habits and institutions. Americans had accumulated
considerable experience in selfgovernment going back to the
creation of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619. Thus our
Constitution, unlike so many documents of the present era,
established a system that the people were ready -- and were
resolved -- to put into practice.
   In essays equally trenchant regarding the modern political
scene, Mr. Goldwin constructs the arguments that formed his
advice to the Reagan administration on the proposed Law of
the Sea Treaty -- intellectual underpinning that helped to
forestall the creation of a large and wasteful international
bureaucracy dealing with minerals in the deep seabed.
   There is, however, one aspect of the book in which Mr.
Goldwin carries his unorthodoxy too far. The problem is
epitomized by his statement that James Madison, whose
writings in The Federalist are an important guide to
interpreting the Constitution, did "not rely on discipline or
education or religion or any form of good motives to control
government officials." The author repeatedly cites Madison's
Federalist 51 to support the proposition that the only
reliable device for keeping government within proper bounds
is self-interest combating self-interest. "Ambition must be
made to counteract ambition." But Mr. Goldwin's thesis has
been developed at the expense of a fair use of the sources.
Madison and the other Founders were not Chicago-school
economists. They knew about self interest, but The Federalist
resounds with the basic moral necessities for government: the
need for "patriotism and love of justice," and for the
sacrifice of "partial interests to the public good." There
must be a "sacred reverence . . . in the breast of the rulers
towards the Constitution." In Madison's view, "Republican
government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a
higher degree than any other form." Platitudes? Not to the
Founders, nor to those who respect them.
