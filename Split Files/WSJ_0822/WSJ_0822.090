   The Persian Gulf anchorman war now faces the threat of a
mind-boggling escalation. Under orders from Iraqi authorities
ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Dan Rather have left Iraq. Now
comes word that Jesse Jackson is heading for Baghdad, in his
role as host for "The Jesse Jackson Show," soon to be
syndicated by Time-Warner Inc. "It would not be appropriate
to go there as a diplomat," said Mr. Jackson, a former
free-lance negotiator. No word yet on whether Larry King,
Geraldo, Donahue, Oprah or Regis will be flying in.
