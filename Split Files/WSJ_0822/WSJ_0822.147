   NEW YORK -- Where there's pain, there may be gains.
   That's the word from some investment advisers specializing
in mutual funds who have surveyed the debris left by the
world-wide stock market sell-off.

   Since Aug. 2, when Iraq stormed into Kuwait, shareholders
of the large companies that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock-index have gotten off relatively lightly. These stocks
are down just 9.5%. Other investors haven't been so lucky.
The Nasdaq Composite Index of small companies is down 12.9%
since the invasion, following a miserable July; the
long-suffering Nikkei index of 225 Japanese companies has
fallen an additional 14.1%.
   So is it time for the small investor to load up on
small-company stocks and Japanese stocks? Maybe so, say some
investment advisers, providing you have an aggressive streak
and a contrarian bent.
   But rather than dabble in regular mutual funds, these
investment advisers suggest buying into downtrodden sectors
by using a peculiar variety of investment fund known as
"closed-end" funds.
   Closed-end funds, which have proliferated in recent years,
trade on a stock exchange just like any other stock. Often,
after brokers abandon their sales drive for a newly launched
closed-end fund, its share price will slip so that the fund
trades for less than the per-share value of the fund's
portfolio. As a result, savvy investors can sometimes buy $1
of stocks for, say, 85 cents.
   For instance, small-company stock funds such as Morgan
Grenfell SmallCap Fund Inc., Royce Value Trust Inc. and
Templeton Value Fund Inc. all trade at intriguing discounts.
Buyers of these funds are, in effect, getting a double
discount. Not only have the stocks in these portfolios been
marked down, but the funds themselves trade at discount
prices.
   These three funds also are managed by highly regarded
stock pickers. According to Lipper Analytical Services,
Morgan Grenfell SmallCap and Royce Value Trust have both
returned just under 5% a year in the three years ended July,
vs. 0.4% a year for the Russell 2000, a small-company index.
Total return is measured by the fund's share-price change
plus dividends and capital gains distributions.
   "Both the funds are well-run," says Kenneth Gregory, a San
Francisco investment adviser who edits the newsletter L/G
No-Load Fund Analyst. "The discounts have widened lately.
That's not surprising at times like this."
   Templeton Value has a shorter track record and trades at a
smaller discount than either Morgan Grenfell or Royce, but
Mr. Gregory reckons it may be the most attractive choice.
This global small-company stock fund, which has two-thirds of
its assets in U.S. stocks, closed yesterday at a 9% discount
to its $9.38-a-share portfolio value.
   In September, shareholders will get to vote on converting
the fund to a regular or "open-end" mutual fund. If the
conversion is approved, it should occur in early 1991. That
will allow investors in Templeton Value to sell out their
shares for the fund's full per-share portfolio value (less a
1% redemption fee payable during the first six months after
conversion), thus giving shareholders an immediate gain.
   "It's an interesting play," says Mr. Gregory. "If you
think the market will bounce back, you've got a double gain
here." But if small-company stocks continue to slide, Mr.
Gregory reckons the closing of the fund's discount should
provide investors with some protection against loss.
   But what about funds that are unlikely to convert to a
regular mutual fund? Are these likely to remain mired at
their current discount? Even if they do, shareholders still
gain. Over the past 12 months, Royce Value Trust paid out
dividends and capital gains totaling 52 cents. Based on its
$9.74 per-share portfolio value, that's a 5.3% yield. But
because the fund's share price is below the fund's portfolio
value, the actual yield is 6.2%.
   For those who want to play a possible rebound in the
Japanese stock market, two options are Japan OTC Equity Fund
and Scudder New Asia Fund Inc., both of which concentrate on
smaller company stocks.
   Richard Barone, chairman of Cleveland's Maxus Investment
Group, looks to buy funds trading at discounts that are
larger than usual. "Scudder New Asia is a definite buy," he
says. Although Japan OTC is also at a large discount, Mr.
Barone says he isn't buying the fund because it is too new
and thus he can't tell whether the current discount is
historically large.
   Scudder New Asia also looks attractive to Charles E.
Johnson, manager of Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund, a
mutual fund that can invest as much as two-thirds of its
assets in closed-end funds. "Of course, if the dollar
rallies, these sorts of funds aren't going to do very well,"
he cautions. A rising dollar would shave the value of foreign
stocks for U.S. investors.
   So far, the Japanese stock market rout has hit
large-company stocks the hardest. That fact hasn't stopped
U.S. investors from marking down the share price of Japan OTC
and Scudder New Asia, both of which invest in smaller
Japanese companies. Japan OTC now is trading at a 21%
discount to the portfolio value, and Scudder New Asia is at
25% discount. (Discounts on other publicly traded funds can
be found by looking in this newspaper on Mondays.)
   "People look at {my} fund and say, `the thing is in
Japan,' and they forget about it," says Andrew Economos,
manager of Scudder New Asia, whose fund is 40% invested in
Japan.
   For the true contrarian, there is unfortunately no Kuwait
fund or Iraq fund. But for those who like the longest odds,
there is the Turkish Investment Fund, which in recent weeks
has been hammered as Istanbul's stock market got pummeled
following the Iraqi invasion.
   The Turkish stock market "was already looking pretty
expensive" before the selloff, notes a portfolio manager with
the fund. "At one point, {the market} was down about 30% from
its high." The fund, which is currently 85% in stocks and 15%
in cash, closed yesterday at a 29% discount to its
$15.58-a-share portfolio value.
   Any time you can buy a single-country fund at a 25% or
greater discount, says Ron Olin of Houston's Deep Discount
Advisors, "that's getting interesting. That's probably a
better play than any place in Vegas."

   For those with a contrarian bent, these funds offer a
double allure. Not only do they invest in beaten-up areas of
the stock market, but the funds themselves trade at bargain
prices.
