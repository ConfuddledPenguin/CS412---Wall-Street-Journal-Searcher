   TDK Corp. said its consolidated pretax profit in the first
quarter ended June 30 rose 8.2% to 14.12 billion yen ($96.4
million) from 13.05 billion yen a year earlier.
   The Japanese electronic-part maker's net income climbed
15% to 6.72 billion yen, or 52.32 yen a share, from 5.85
billion yen, or 46.52 yen a share, a year earlier. Sales rose
15% to 128.5 billion yen from 112.16 billion yen.

   Sales in TDK's recording media category, accounting for
31% of total sales, reached 40.37 billion yen, up 9.4% from
36.91 billion yen. In the category, officials noted that
overseas sales, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, were
strong enough to offset sluggish domestic sales.
   TDK said total overseas sales were 68.28 billion yen, a
34% increase from 51 billion yen. Officials cited the yen's
depreciation as a reason for the rise.
