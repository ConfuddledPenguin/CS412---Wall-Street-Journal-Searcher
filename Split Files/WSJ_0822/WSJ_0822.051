   FARRELL, Pa. -- Sharon Steel Corp. said that it resolved a
dispute with the U.S. government about cleanup of hazardous
materials, and that the agreement potentially "cleared a
major hurdle" in the reorganization of the nation's
18th-largest steel company, which is in Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The settlement regarding two sites fixes Sharon Steel's
maximum liability and provides payment options of either a
$22 million lump sum or an unsecured claim of $70 million and
cash payments of $12 million over six years. The agreement
requires bankruptcy court approval.
