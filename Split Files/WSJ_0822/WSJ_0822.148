   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
Unix System Laboratories Inc., Intel Corp. and Santa Cruz
Operation Inc. said they developed a standard that allows
designers to write Unix software for personal computers that
use Intel's 386 and 486 microprocessors.
   As a result, the companies said application developers
following this specification can create a single version of
their software that will run on all 386- or 486-based
operating systems that conform to the specification.

   AT&amp;T and companies that make computers that run the Unix
operating system have been trying to come up with a standard
to challenge Microsoft Corp.'s widely used DOS operating
system.
