   NEWTON, Mass. -- Stardent Computer Inc. said that its
shareholders removed its former co-chairmen from the board
and affirmed a closer relationship with Kubota Corp.,
Stardent's largest investor.
   Allen H. Michels and Matthew H. Sanders III, who had
co-founded one of Stardent's two predecessor companies, sued
Kubota last month alleging that the Japanese tractor maker
was conspiring to steal Stardent's technology for making
graphics supercomputers. Kubota and Stardent have both denied
the allegation.

   Stardent's board had already stripped the two men of their
co-chairmen titles in the wake of the suit. However, they
remained directors under company bylaws.
   "We see this as a direct consequence of actions proposed
by the Japanese-dominated board," said Mr. Michels. "Mr.
Sanders and I are undaunted by such blatant interference and
will continue to press our case vigorously in the courts."
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the pair filed yesterday an
amendment to their original suit, adding Stardent Computer
and Stardent President John Poduska to the list of
defendants. The amendment also adds the charge that Kubota
and the other defendants unlawfully discharged Mr. Michels
and Mr. Sanders.
   Stardent, which is owned by employees and venture capital
investors, said that Kubota will invest as much as $60
million in Stardent over the next 12 months raising its stake
to 28% from 22%. Kubota has already invested about $100
million in Stardent and one of its predecessors.
   Meanwhile, Kubota will take over development of Stardent's
current product line while Stardent will concentrate on new
product development. Kubota remains Stardent's exclusive
manufacturer and retains all Asian distribution rights.
