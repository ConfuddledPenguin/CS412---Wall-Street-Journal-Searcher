   President Bush planned to sign an order today activating
military reserve specialists, as he rejected Saddam Hussein's
latest offer to hold talks on the Persian Gulf standoff.
   But even as the crisis edged closer to armed
confrontation, U.S. military commanders in Washington and the
Mideast expressed reservations about the current level of
U.S. forces -- more than 30,000 troops -- in the region. To
deter a ground attack and launch any kind of major offensive
action, these officials suggested that they need to at least
double, and perhaps quadruple, American troop strength in the
Gulf.

   Amid the mounting tensions, the State Department confirmed
that at least 54 Americans now are believed to be in Iraqi
custody. And bolstering the U.S. effort to choke Iraq
economically, nine West European countries authorized their
growing fleet of warships in the Persian Gulf to use force to
back United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   At Mr. Bush's vacation house in Kennebunkport, Maine,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu described the planned
reserve call-up as "surgical and specialized." Other
officials said the call-up might be slightly larger than Mr.
Sununu's description suggested, but would be well below
earlier, speculative estimates of 250,000 soldiers. Mr. Bush,
who is scheduled to meet today in Kennebunkport with his top
national security advisers, is expected to initially leave
the number of reservists ambiguous.
   As the U.S. continues to gear up in its confrontation with
Saddam Hussein, there were some indications that the Iraqi
leader may be beginning to feel the squeeze. Yesterday, in an
"open letter to President Bush," he combined his customary
anti-American rhetoric with some surprisingly candid
admissions of vulnerability.
   "You must also realize that scientific and technological
progress, development and prosperity could not be achieved as
Arabs hope without dealing with the West," the Iraqi leader
said, according to a translation of his text provided by
Reuters. "For this to be realized," he added, "they {Arabs}
have to sell oil and the oil market is basically in Europe,
America and Japan."
   Iraq also reiterated its call for talks with the U.S. to
resolve the crisis.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed
Baghdad's request for negotiations. The U.S. is talking
regularly with Iraq about American citizens being held in
Kuwait and Iraq, but Mr. Fitzwater suggested that Western
nations aren't interested in any broader negotiations until
Baghdad agrees to withdraw from Kuwait.
   "The U.N. has been very clear in demanding a complete and
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait," Mr. Fitzwater said. He
added that all the nations involved in the multinational
action against Iraq "are willing to talk with Iraq, but only
within the context of compliance with the U.N. resolutions."
   Separately, the U.S. allowed an Iraqi oil tanker to go to
port in Yemen. The tanker was one of two at which U.S.
warships fired warning shots over the weekend. Mr. Fitzwater
said the U.S. allowed the tanker to dock on the basis of an
assurance from Yemen that it "would neither unload nor use
any Iraqi oil." But, he added: "We intend to follow up to
make sure that they comply with the sanctions."
   Senior U.S. military officials claimed that Navy
interdiction efforts have forced many Iraqi vessels to slow
down, stay away from ports or sail empty to avoid a
confrontation. The number of ships calling at the port of
Aqaba, Jordan, has dropped 90%, these officials said, and
other ports in the region also show a significant decline in
shipping activity. These officials added that some Iraqi
ships have steered zigzag courses and changed speeds,
apparently to make it difficult to guess their destinations
and thereby avoid direct confrontation.
   As the U.S. military buildup continues, officials won't
discuss contingency plans. But diversion and surprise are
likely to be important components of any military move.
   The sheer number of Marines and the equipment they're
bringing with them suggests that one of the options the
Pentagon may be weighing is some sort of quick amphibious or
airborne assault against Kuwait. The Seventh Marine
Expeditionary brigade just arrived in northwestern Saudi
Arabia, equipped with heavy artillery and Cobra attack
helicopters. Such units are intended primarily for offensive
missions.
   Some of Iraq's best troops are massed within 40 miles of
the Saudi border, and cutting them off would deal a blow to
Baghdad. Threats of U.S. amphibious assaults, combined with
air attacks launched from carriers steaming in the Red Sea
and Persian Gulf, could force Saddam Hussein to spread out
his crack troops.
   Pentagon officials say the least favorable military option
would be a drawn-out land battle with Iraq's best troops,
which are battle-hardened from nearly 10 years of fighting in
the Iran-Iraq war. But even in that sort of confrontation,
U.S. officials believe American ground troops initially would
have the edge because of their greater mobility and their
ability to fight at night.
   The Gulf effort, the largest U.S. military buildup since
the Vietnam War, is likely to bring more than 100,000
American troops to Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon says it could
take months to build up a force that large. But already, the
U.S. says, the air and naval power assembled in the region
would prevent the Iraqis from overwhelming U.S. troops with a
direct frontal assault.
   Other military strategists say even though the U.S.
doesn't face the threat of retaliation from the Soviet Union
in this crisis, it would make almost no sense for Washington
to contemplate using nuclear weapons to dislodge the Iraqis.
   Albert Wohlstetter, a nuclear strategist, said that the
political cost would be enormous and the military advantage
would be slight. He argued that likely targets for a U.S.
attack on Iraq, such as pumping stations and refineries,
could be destroyed about as well with conventional as nuclear
weapons.
   He said nuclear weapons might be used if U.S. forces were
about to be overwhelmed in a tank battle in the desert. But
even in such a scenario, he argued, there may be alternatives
to using nuclear weapons.
   Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein continued to wield the weapon of
hostage-taking. The State Department said yesterday that
another American and eight more British citizens were rounded
up from their lodgings in Kuwait by the Iraqi military.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said that
"we don't know for sure" where 41 of the 54 Americans in
Iraqi custody are being held. He added that the U.S. has
"credible reports" that some Westerners have been moved to
what he called "Iraqi industrial installations." And an Arab
diplomatic source in Washington said there were reports that
about 30 Westerners were placed at military installations in
Kuwait several days ago, but a State Department spokesman
said he hadn't heard that.
   Saddam Hussein vowed last week to use Westerners as
"shields" at military and research facilities that might be
likely targets for American bombs.
   Mr. Boucher also said that 18 U.S. Embassy personnel in
Baghdad left Iraq and entered Jordan yesterday, leaving about
a dozen U.S. diplomats in Iraq. He said the remaining
personnel would be sufficient to keep the embassy functioning
and "carry out its primary mission -- that is, to see to the
safety and welfare of American citizens in Iraq and Kuwait."
   U.S. officials also said they were making contingency
plans to reduce the number of American diplomats based in
Kuwait City. The officials said no final decision has been
made on whether to reduce the number of diplomats there.
Saddam Hussein has ordered all Western embassies closed by
Friday and threatened to treat diplomats the same way it
treats all other Westerners if they remain after that.
   The nine West European nations meeting yesterday in Paris
echoed President Bush's warning that there would be "grave
consequences" if Western hostages were harmed. The Europeans
also gave full backing to an eventual U.N.-sponsored military
blockade of Iraq.
