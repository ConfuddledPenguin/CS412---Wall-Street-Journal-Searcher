   Mr. Coffee Inc. is putting Joe DiMaggio back in its
marketing lineup as the race among automatic coffee makers
heats up.
   The contract comes at a time of increased competition in
the coffee machine business -- and just before the
all-important Christmas advertising season. The company says
it will spend $2 million of its $11 million marketing budget
this year in the fourth quarter for the two television
advertisements that will feature Mr. DiMaggio.

   The former Yankee outfielder became Mr. Coffee's spokesman
in 1974, and remained until five years ago, during which the
company dominated the automatic drip coffee maker market. Mr.
DiMaggio left when the company decided to switch its ad
campaigns to more product-specific themes. Peter Howell, Mr.
Coffee's new president and chief executive officer, says such
commercials were never the hit with viewers that Mr.
DiMaggio's were.
   Indeed, since Joltin' Joe went away, the company's market
share declined from 32% to about 28%. Mr. Coffee has set a
goal of 35% by 1995.
   The Cleveland-based company, which sold four million
shares to the public in June as part of a restrucuturing
under new management, wouldn't disclose the value of the two
year contract, with an option for a third year. But Morris
Engelberg, a Florida attorney who represents Mr. DiMaggio,
characterized the deal as "a multimillion dollar contract."
   Mr. DiMaggio had been approached by "several" other coffee
makers, Mr. Engelberg says. He will continue to do his
popular advertisements with Bowery Bank.
   "If you don't advertise, all you've got left is price,"
says Mr. Howell. He complains that many coffee makers are
discounting their machines, hurting Mr. Coffee, the industry
leader.
   The advertisements will be a brief skit featuring Mr.
DiMaggio, and, of course, baseball. Filming will begin within
three weeks in southern Florida, where Mr. DiMaggio now
resides.
   Now, Mr. Coffee is switching back to marketing its whole
line of 40 different machines -- ranging in price from $16 to
$60 -- as one. "It made sense to have {Mr. DiMaggio} back as
a spokesman," says Mr. Howell. "Spokesmen work better for a
whole line of products."
   Particularly this spokesman. Mr. DiMaggio, now 75 years
old, and Mr. Coffee are inseparable even after the five year
hiatus. "A lot of people think Joe DiMaggio owned Mr.
Coffee," says Mr. Howell, who was negotiating with the star
for six months. "We believe, maybe stupidly, that the
connection is stronger than {an appeal to} any age group or
sex.
   "People remember what the Yankees were when he was in his
prime. Even 20 and 30 year olds ask me, `Where's Joe?'"
   As for Mr. DiMaggio, his attorney says "he's happy to be
back." The endorsement is natural: He drinks between seven
and eight cups of coffee a day.
