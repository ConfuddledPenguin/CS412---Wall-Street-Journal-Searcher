   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc. said investors have
filed two class action lawsuits against the company, alleging
violations of federal securities laws.
   The company said the suits, filed in federal court here,
were filed in connection with the announcement two weeks ago
of Businessland's fiscal 1990 loss of $21.5 million, or 73
cents a share. News of the loss hammered Businessland stock,
which plunged 58% to $2.875 the day it was reported. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Businessland
shares closed at $2.75, down 37.5 cents.

   Businessland didn't elaborate on the complaints, but it
would appear that the charges are related to disclosure
requirements in the period leading up to the announcement of
the company's earnings. The computer retailer said the
lawsuits were "completely without merit" and said it would
contest them vigorously.
