   American Cyanamid Co., Wayne, N.J., said its board
approved a program for purchasing 10 million to 12 million of
its common shares, or as much as 12.5% of the total
outstanding.
   The biotechnology and chemical company said such buy-backs
will be made in public or private transactions from time to
time, in accordance with federal securities-trading
guidelines "designed to minimize market impact." As of June
30, Cyanamid had 95,792,685 shares outstanding.

   The company recently agreed to sell its Shulton Group
consumer and personal-care businesses, including lines such
as Old Spice, Breck and Pine-Sol. Aggregate proceeds are
expected to exceed $835 million. The company said the Shulton
divestitures warrant a "corresponding realignment" of
Cyanamid's capital structure. A company spokesman indicated
that proceeds from the Shulton sales would be used to finance
the stock purchases.
