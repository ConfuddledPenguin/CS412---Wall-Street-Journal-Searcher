   EAST BERLIN -- Even before he assumed the presidency of
the agency charged with privatizing East Germany's collapsing
economy, West German businessman Detlev Rohwedder was daunted
by its problems.
   "Most of the letters I receive here with my name on them I
simply cannot answer," said Mr. Rohwedder, surveying a stack
of correspondence last week.

   While Mr. Rohwedder struggles to find answers, East
Germany is coming apart at the seams. Production is spiraling
downward as unemployment soars. Most investors remain on the
sidelines, and companies can't sell their products to
consumers, who prefer Western goods. Thousands of angry
farmers drove here in tractors and reapers last week to pelt
East German government ministers with eggs and tomatoes they
couldn't sell.
   Mr. Rohwedder was interviewed a few days before he became
president of the trust company set up to safeguard East
Germany's 8,000 companies -- and to liquidate those that
can't survive in the capitalist atmosphere that will prevail
when Germany unifies later this year. Until Monday, he was
the administrative supervisor of the agency, called the
Treuhandanstalt, but then succeeded Reiner Maria Gohlke, who
resigned. Industry sources say that Mr. Gohlke was
overwhelmed by the task and that Bonn was frustrated by his
poor results.
   Mr. Rohwedder says his staff is already overwhelmed by
petitions from people demanding help -- dubious investors
entangled in legal webs, desperate company managers and angry
workers.
   Now, East Germany's governing coalition has collapsed.
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, more in an act of economic
capitulation than political triumph, yesterday announced an
agreement with most East German political parties to set Oct.
14 as the date for unification, six weeks ahead of the
originally planned Dec. 2 date. But within hours, the Social
Democrats rebelled and said they would push for even earlier
unification -- on Sept. 15 -- because of the speed of East
Germany's economic collapse.
   Meanwhile, all that is keeping East Germany alive is West
German largesse -- grants, subsidies and loans from a
government that must fear the electoral consequences of
economic chaos in East Germany when it faces all-German
elections in December. Heiner Flassbeck of the German
Economic Research Institute in Berlin already is raising his
estimate for the two Germanys' budget deficit for this year
by 10 billion marks ($6.39 billion) to 66 billion marks,
almost all of that due to the cost of unification. West
Germany's budget deficit was only 4.5 billion marks last
year.
   Yet at the Treuhandanstalt, Mr. Rohwedder still hasn't
enough information on East German companies to properly pass
out some 22.5 billion marks in emergency lending that has
already been approved for East German companies.
   "We do not even yet know whether we are giving the cash to
the right people," says Mr. Rohwedder, who adds that the
company's books are in such chaos that the Treuhandanstalt
won't know their true status until their first, Western-style
profit-and-loss statements arrive Sept. 30. "We can't even
tell yet which companies don't need help at all and which
others don't deserve it."
   The sheer size of the task not only challenges West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is campaigning to lead the
reunited Germany, but it also raises profound worries about
the prospects for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev has told West German officials that
he needs success in East Germany to sway skeptics in his own
country, a senior Bonn official says.
   "We are still far away from collapse," says Mr. Rohwedder.
"But if the transitional problems are so complex and
difficult in East Germany, with its strong partner in the
West, it is difficult to see how the Russians would ever copy
the situation unless someone {with lots of money} takes them
by the hand and leads them. Against this background, I am
gloomy about the potential of Russians recovering or changing
their economic system. . . . This thing has never been done
before, and it is very complicated."
   Visits to East German companies and farms show an economy
dangerously adrift. Industrial companies lack liquidity and
investors, farms don't have customers or competitive
products, and consumers are spending little of what money
they earn on East German products.
   Less than one year ago, the chairman of East Germany's
largest and only tire-making company, Norbert Novakowski, was
finishing his studies at the elite Communist Party Central
Committee training institute in Berlin. Yet West German
bankers now consider Mr. Novakowski to be one of the most
skilled converts to capitalism.
   Mr. Novakowski was among the first to begin privatizing
his company. He sold off a retread company that could only be
profitable in an East German economy of tire shortages, and
he closed down a motorcycle and bicycle-tire company that
couldn't compete with Western prices. But now he has run
aground in an economy that lacks paying customers.
   Nervous consumers either are buying Western cars for which
he can't yet make tires or saving their money in expectation
of hard times. His biggest industrial customer, the giant IFA
truck-making factory, is still ordering tires, but it can't
pay its bills. In response, Mr. Novakoski isn't paying for
his synthetic rubber shipments from Buna AG, one of the
country's largest chemical companies. "I can produce as much
as I want, but no one I deliver to in East Germany can pay
me," he says, "And that means I can't pay others."
   "This vicious cycle is repeated almost everywhere in the
East German economy," says Kurt Kasch, a board member at
Deutsche Bank, which Treuhandanstalt officials estimate is
managing nearly half the loans they are distributing. "What
we are witnessing is an economy without cash. The tough
choice for Bonn is either to throw more money into industry
or allow unemployment to spread. If Helmut Kohl, who has been
so successful in foreign policy, is not careful, East German
economic problems could harm his election campaign."
   But if East Germany's industrial picture is bleak, its
agricultural outlook is disastrous. Werner Wuehst, president
of the farmers association, says more than half of the 3,850
agricultural cooperatives are near collapse. Many haven't
paid salaries since July. Their products are poorly packaged,
don't taste as good and cost more to produce due to outmoded
technologies and forced use of relatively unproductive land.
After farmers' protests that included herding pigs to the
Parliament, dumping milk on city council steps and burning
crops that couldn't be sold, Bonn pledged 5.6 billion marks
to support agriculture.
   The chairman of one of East Germany's largest agricultural
cooperatives, Wilfried Klatt, complains that he can't even
sell his goods to the local supermarket, Kaufhalle, in his
farm's home village of Klosterfelde. He offered the store
wholesale beef prices that were 20% below what it was paying,
but the owner declined the deal. The owner explained that his
contract only allowed him to buy from his West German
distributor. Increasingly emotional East Germans suspect a
West German plot to so undermine their companies and farms
that they can be bought cheaply.
   So Mr. Klatt declared war on the supermarket, cutting his
prices even lower and selling them out of a truck at the back
gate of his cooperative. Word has spread that the battle is
against the West German distributor, and local buyers line up
to support the fight.
   Having heard of Mr. Klatt's economic woes, West German
merchants came to town last week to offer to buy 300 of his
cows for half the price they would pay their own farmers. "It
was humiliating. Do you know what I would like to do with
these people?" he says, twisting his thick hands together as
if to break a neck.
   Yet Mr. Klatt is optimistic that he'll survive under
free-market conditions. He's cutting production of potatoes
and grain in half -- the soil is too sandy to grow them
economically. He'll concentrate on livestock, milk cows and
grain. Mr. Klatt has already consulted a Dutch designer to
make his packaging more attractive.
   "None of us wants to go backwards, but we also need time
to become competitive," says Helgard Krowal, who manages
animal production at the cooperative. "Other European
Community countries, such as Spain and Portugal, had years to
adjust their agricultural policies before joining, so why do
they expect us to do it overnight?"
   She can't imagine that the West German government can
allow the cooperative, however inefficient, to go under
overnight. The cooperative consists of 4,000 hectares of land
(9,880 acres), 5,300 head of cattle, 1,600 milk cows and
7,500 pigs. It produces 17 tons of milk a day, and 8,000 tons
of potatoes a year. As Mrs. Krowal walks through a huge barn,
she frowns.
   "You can't just stop milking those cows," she says. She
notes that while fewer than 300 days have passed since the
Berlin Wall was opened, it takes 329 days to breed a pig
before slaughter and more than twice that time for cattle.
   "The problem is that the unification process has taken
less time than the cycle for a pig," she explains.
