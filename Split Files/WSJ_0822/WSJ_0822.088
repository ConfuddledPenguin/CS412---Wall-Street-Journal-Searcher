   NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended Aug. 15
rose 4.1% to a record volume on the New York Stock Exchange
but declined slightly on the American Stock Exchange.
   Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of Montreal was the short position
leader among Big Board companies, at 16,256,029 shares, up
from only 103,241 shares in the prior period. Analysts said
it was probably attributable to dividend-capture trading. The
record date for payment of Alcan's quarterly dividend was
Monday.

   New York exchange short interest rose at the Aug. 15
settlement date to 668,964,125 shares from 642,585,339 at
mid-July. The previous record was in mid-June, at
661,212,877. On the Amex, short interest sank to 77,127,804
shares from an adjusted 77,421,899 shares, a record short
volume. The month included the 23 trading days through Aug.
8.
   At mid-August 1989, short volume was 554,537,766 shares on
the Big Board, indicating a 20.6% advance, and 51,844,137
shares on the Amex, indicating a 48.8% rise.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio fell to 3.62 from mid-July's 4.53. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position. Average daily New York
exchange volume for the 23 trading days was 184,992,718
shares. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has
weakened in value as an indicator because options and other
products can be used to hedge short positions.
   Among bellwether issues, International Business Machines
Corp. saw its short interest volume drop 37% to 2,662,507
shares; Philip Morris Cos. dropped 47% to 1,601,275 shares,
and General Motors Corp. fell 40% to 1,644,364 shares.
