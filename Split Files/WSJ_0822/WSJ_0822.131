   Aura Systems Inc. said it has entered into a contract
valued at roughly $34 million with one of Detroit's Big Three
to provide electromagnetic actuators for automobiles.
   An actuator is a device that takes an electrical input and
then generates a force that can move a part. Aura Systems
declined to say precisely what its actuators will be used
for, but said the components will be incorporated into
six-cylinder cars.

   "They will have a special application at first, but then
they will become standard at a later point," Harry Kurtzman,
Aura's president, said in an interview. "The details should
all come out in the next few months."
   Mr. Kurtzman said that the auto maker asked not to be
named at this time.
   Pre-production development and testing is scheduled to
begin immediately, Aura Systems said, with initial production
of about 1.7 million units scheduled to start in summer 1991.
That batch of units, priced at about $20 apiece, will take
about a year to build.
