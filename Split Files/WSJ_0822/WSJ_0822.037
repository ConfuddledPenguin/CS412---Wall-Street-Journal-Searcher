   BRUSSELS -- Most European Community laws and policies will
become directly applicable in East Germany as soon as the
country merges with West Germany, the EC Commission said.
   The decision to integrate the country rapidly into the EC
is likely to be approved by the 12 EC member governments.
This means East Germans will reap EC aid and subsidies -- and
a dose of economic shock.

   The commission said EC policies would be implemented in
East Germany as soon as Oct. 15, the date favored for
unification by most German political forces. But the call
yesterday for the earlier date prompted a split in East
Germany's Social Democratic Party.
   Upon unification, East German "citizens . . . will have
all the rights and obligations of the citizens of the EC,"
Commission President Jacques Delors said, referring to the
free movement of people, goods and services throughout the
community, as well as EC policies on agriculture, energy,
transport and competition. Among exceptions, environmental
norms won't have to be implemented before 1996, and East
German industry will have until 1993 to bring its chemical,
pharmaceutical and food products up to EC standards. But the
commission made clear it wants few exceptions. For example,
EC standards on the safety of nuclear power plants will apply
upon unification, effectively forcing all five of East
Germany's nuclear power plants to close.
   Mr. Delors also sought to dispel fears that the cost of
rescuing the East German economy will deprive poor regions in
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece or Ireland of EC subsidies.
