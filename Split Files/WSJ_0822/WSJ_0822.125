   Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., The Woodlands, Texas,
said it increased its capital spending budget for fiscal 1991
ending Jan. 31 by 9.1% to $227 million from $208 million.
   The revised sum represents an increase of about $32
million, or 16%, from year-earlier capital spending of $195
million.

   The largest part of the increase, about $12 million, is
allocated for Mitchell's transmission and processing
division, primarily for the construction of underground
natural gas storage facilities. The division's total spending
budget now stands at $29 million, about the same as a year
earlier.
   The remainder of the increased sum, about $7 million, is
earmarked for Mitchell's real estate division and provides
for, among other things, the purchase of a hotel in
Galveston, Texas. The division's fiscal 1991 expenditures
will total $98 million, compared with $82 million in fiscal
1990.
