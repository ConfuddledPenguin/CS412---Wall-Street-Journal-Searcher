   Grew Sharply

   WASHINGTON -- The government said it had a $25.93 billion
deficit for July, more than $7 billion larger than in July
1989.
   Higher spending was to blame. Government outlays were up
more than 16% from July 1989, to $98.29 billion, the Treasury
said, partly from the cost of bailing out failed savings and
loan associations.

   The spending increase eclipsed a 9.3% gain in receipts, to
$72.36 billion, which largely came from bigger individual
income tax payments.
   With two months to go in fiscal 1990, the government is
already $189.09 billion in the red, and analysts said the
latest figures virtually assure that the gap will exceed $200
billion for the first time since 1986. The White House has
increased its forecast to $218 billion. Though the Treasury
often has a surplus for September because of the quarterly
tax payments due then, it didn't record one last September
and probably won't this year.
   Both higher spending -- necessitated partly by the thrift
rescue -- and a slowdown in the economy have pulverized the
budget process this year, and the Middle East crisis is
compounding the financial difficulties as the fiscal year
ends. Even though tax receipts were up considerably last
month, analysts noted that their pace of increase has been
well behind that of previous years.
   Jerry Zukowski, an economist at PaineWebber, calculates
that tax receipts are running 4.3% ahead of last year
compared with an average increase during the previous two
fiscal years of 7.8%. At the same time, he said government
expenditures are 10.6% higher than they were last fiscal year
at this time, compared with an average rise of 5.6% in the
two previous fiscal years.
   "We're basically getting hit from both sides in terms of
the federal budget deficit this year," Mr. Zukowski said.
   Treasury officials said July is a poor time to look for
trends in individual tax receipts, as there are very few
personal tax payments during that month.
   The 1990 budget is in a sense history. The government
won't meet the deficit limit under the Gramm-Rudman budget
law -- $110 billion, under a formula that excludes much of
the thrift-bailout costs -- but there are no sanctions for
exceeding the target this late in the process.
   Most eyes in this city are turned toward the fiscal 1991
budget, which White House and congressional negotiators have
been trying to draft for several months. If they don't agree
on a deficit-reduction plan, the White House estimated this
week that the 1991 deficit will reach $232 billion. Following
the Gramm-Rudman formula, the gap would come to $149 billion,
the White House said, more than $85 billion larger than the
deficit-reduction law's target. And if negotiators don't
settle on a budget package by Oct. 1, the start of fiscal
1991, the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic spending cuts will
kick in.
   Meanwhile, the deficit probably will swell in the
remaining two months of fiscal 1990, due in part to the
increased military spending from the deployment of U.S.
troops to the Middle East.
   Net spending on the thrift clean-up came to about $4
billion in July. More than $18 billion of government outlays
last month went to pay interest on the federal debt.
   The fiscal 1989 deficit was $151.89 billion.
