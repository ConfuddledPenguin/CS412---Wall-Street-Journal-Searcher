   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. unveiled
three low-end minicomputers, taking its AS/400 family into
territory occupied by the most powerful personal computers
and workstations.
   In making the announcement, Robert LaBant, the new general
manager of IBM's minicomputer line, rejected the "midrange"
label commonly associated with his strong-selling products.
Some analysts have declared midrange computers, including the
two-year-old AS/400, creatures of the past.

   "The AS/400 is a full-range system," said Mr. LaBant. To
back up that statement, he promised that yesterday's low-end
introductions will be followed next year by products that
will double the performance of the most powerful AS/400,
extending the family into the territory of mainframe
computers.
   Minicomputers traditionally fall between personal
computers and mainframe computers in terms of power.
   The three new computers include two small models of the
AS/400, which IBM is aiming at small-business users, and a
new model of the AS/Entry, an updated version of an older
minicomputer line, the System/36. By swapping only a few
components, however, this new AS/Entry can become an AS/400.
   IBM also introduced a new, easy-to-use version of the
AS/400's operating system; several new disk and memory
options; new ways to connect with other IBM and non-IBM
computers; and a plethora of AS/400 applications software
from various manufacturers. And the Armonk, N.Y., company
said it would make it easier for software developers to write
programs for the AS/400.
   The new models range in price from $11,000 to $17,500 for
hardware only, and will be available in late September and
October. Mr. LaBant said the AS/400 is now price-competitive
with personal computers and workstations for applications
using a "server" computer and as few as four terminals. A
server acts as a central store of files and programs for
computers on a network.
   In a presentation to consultants, IBM went even further,
making price comparisons between the AS/400 and its own PS/2
personal computers and RS/6000 workstations. That's an
unusual step for IBM, further indicating that its lines of
business are no longer staying off each other's turf.
