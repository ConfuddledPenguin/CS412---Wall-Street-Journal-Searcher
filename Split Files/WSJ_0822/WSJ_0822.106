   Boeing Co. said its de Havilland unit received an order

   The twin-engine, turboprop planes will be assigned to
Sea/Air/Ground Leasing Corp., another Canopus unit, to be
marketed to the regional-airline industry, Seattle-based
Boeing said.
   A Boeing spokesman said the company continues to discuss
the possible sale of the unprofitable de Havilland unit with
Aeritalia of Italy and Aerospatiale of France.
