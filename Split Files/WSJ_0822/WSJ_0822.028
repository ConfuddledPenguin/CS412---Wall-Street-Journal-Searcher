   NEW YORK -- No decision has been reached on whether a
planned Philadelphia note issue totaling about $400 million
will be backed by a letter of credit.
   "It's probably more likely it will be several" banks each
backing a portion of the issue, said Sheila Connolly, vice
president of P.G. Corbin &amp; Co., the city's financial adviser.

   Philadelphia has solicited a number of banks to provide
credit enhancement for the deal, Ms. Connolly said. A
decision is expected within the next day or so, she added,
but declined to say which banks are involved.
   An official with the lead underwriter, Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said a decision was expected today.
   At least one bank appears interested in backing at least
25% of the issue, according to a Philadelphia official who
asked to remain anonymous.
   The notes, which would mature in May 1991, are expected to
be sold within the next few weeks. Proceeds will be used to
help the city buy time to solve its fiscal problems.
   Philadelphia officials declined to comment on the sale.
