   May I ask, in this
   Innocent letter,
   Why do things have to
   Get worse before
   They get better?
   If one's interrupted,
   Even though shrewdly,
   Why must it always
   Be "rudely"?
   And why are some books,
   Though overrated,
   Referred to as "Long-awaited"?
   What baffles this bard
   Is why must the look
   Be "long and hard"?
   Finally, I've always
   Been mystified
   That something that's cut
   Must also be dried.
   -- Dow Richardson.

   "Patience is a virtue"
   And I admire the aforesaid --
   In the driver behind me,
   Not in the one ahead.
