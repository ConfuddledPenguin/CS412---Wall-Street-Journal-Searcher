   DETROIT -- Just a few weeks ago U.S. auto makers were
hoping for a second-half sales rebound that, however modest,
would help erase the gloom of a sluggish first half. But no
more.
   The 10 companies that build cars in the U.S. have shaved
more than 53,000 vehicles from their third-quarter production
plans in just the past month. What's more, say persons
familiar with the planning process, more cuts could come this
week when some companies hold another round of planning
meetings.

   The reason for this shift: The Mideast crisis appears to
have added new uncertainty to an economic outlook already
clouded by declining consumer confidence.
   Big Three stocks have taken a beating recently as a result
of the depressed auto market and concerns over the Persian
Gulf crisis. Chrysler Corp.'s shares, which were trading at
$15 on Aug. 1, closed yesterday at $12.125, down 37.5 cents
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. That
dropped the market value of Chrysler, the nation's
eighth-largest industrial company, to about $2.7 billion.
   Ford Motor Co. shares fell $1 yesterday to close at $35,
down from $41.125 Aug. 1, and General Motors Corp. fell $1.25
yesterday to $36.375, down from $45.375 Aug. 1.
   "What we've seen in the past several months is a consumer
that has become more concerned about the outlook of the
economy and more cautious of spending plans," said Richard
Curtin, who runs the University of Michigan's well-known
consumer-confidence survey. "The problems in the Middle East
come at a time when consumers already are in a cautious mood.
The Persian Gulf crisis might accelerate that."
   Indeed, total car and truck sales dropped 2.7% in July
from a year earlier, and in early August, sales of domestic
vehicles (imports aren't reported until the end of the month)
plunged 18.5%. Thus auto makers are "being very cautious"
with their production plans, said John Qualls, analyst at
Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc. "We are sort of on a cusp, if you will.
The economy could go either way."
   There is some good news for auto makers and the economy:
The production cuts come when inventory levels are at their
lowest since September 1986, Mr. Qualls said. As of July 31,
new-car inventories stood at a 50-day supply, well below the
60-to-65-day supply considered an ideal inventory level in
the industry.
   Thus, third-quarter production still is slated to increase
from last year, when inventories were far higher. But the
rise won't be as big as previously thought. U.S. auto makers
plan to build 1,522,512 cars in the third quarter, an
increase of nearly 9% from a year ago. Earlier plans had been
to increase car production by 11.6%.
   The situation with trucks and vans is much the same. The
companies expect to boost production 6.5% from last year, to
892,260 vehicles. A month ago, they had planned to increase
production by 8.3%.
   The new third-quarter production schedules are
"appropriate" and reflect softened demand, said analyst John
Casesa of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "Fourth-quarter schedules
are at risk. If the Mideast crisis causes consumer confidence
to drop and consumers delay purchases, we could see an
overall softening in demand."
   The biggest adjustment in third-quarter car output from
July estimates came from Ford. Citing slow sales and material
trim shortage, Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford temporarily closed
this week two assembly plants and extended the shutdown of
another plant, idling it for a total of two weeks.
   Sources say the shutdowns reduced earlier third-quarter
car plans by more than 20,000 cars to 354,200 cars. So far,
Ford's truck production plans remain unchanged at 355,000
vehicles.
   GM reduced its third-quarter production plans by some
3,800 cars and 16,000 trucks so far, but the final reduction
may be steeper. GM's cuts don't reflect the recent strike at
a parts plant in Flint, Mich., which caused several assembly
plants to shut down temporarily. It's still unclear how much
of that lost production Detroit-based GM will seek to make up
in this quarter.
   Chrysler trimmed its earlier production schedules by 3,000
cars to a combined 271,000 vehicles. The Highland Park,
Mich.-based concern earlier made allowances for the shutdown
of its two minivan plants for a month each to retool for the
redesigned 1991 Chrysler minivan.
   All of the Japanese auto makers with U.S. operations are
planning to increase car production in the current quarter,
except Nissan Motor Corp. Nissan's third-quarter output is
expected to drop 54% to 12,662 cars because of retooling for
the redesigned 1991 Sentra subcompact model at the Smyrna,
Tenn., assembly plant.
   Here's a look at the latest third-quarter production
schedules:
