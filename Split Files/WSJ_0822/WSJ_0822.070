   SEATTLE -- King Broadcasting Co. said majority
shareholders put the closely held radio and television
company up for sale, adding that proceeds will be used to
help the environment.
   King owns six television stations in the Northwest and
Hawaii, six radio stations in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and
San Francisco, and 13 cable television systems in Washington,
Idaho, California and Minnesota. Analysts placed the market
value of the company at about $400 million. The company has
annual revenue estimated at about $150 million.

   Priscilla Bullitt Collins, board chairwoman, and her
sister Harriet Stimson Bullitt, chairwoman of the executive
committee, said they intend to concentrate on preserving the
environment in the Northwest through projects funded by the
family's Bullitt Foundation.
   The two women said that, including stock owned by their
late mother, they own 70% of King's shares. The women said
that the company is financially healthy and that they chose
to sell now partly because of their age. Both women are more
than 65 years old.
   "We prefer to sell at a time of our own choosing rather
than wait until a sale would be required by our deaths," the
sisters said in a statement.
   They said they have retained Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and
Sterling Payot Co. to advise them on the sale.
   The Bullitt family is one of the most prominent and
wealthy in the Seattle area. The sisters' grandparents built
a lumber and real estate empire and founded hospitals,
schools and Seattle's symphony and yacht club. The sisters'
mother, Dorothy, who died last year at the age of 97, founded
King in 1946 by buying a radio station so she could fulfill
her dream of broadcasting classical music. In 1948, she
acquired a TV station that later became KING-TV, now King's
flagship station.
   Dorothy Bullitt also founded the Bullitt Foundation, which
has long contributed to civic projects and to preserving the
Pacific Northwest. The sisters said they planned to "build a
program second to none" to protect the region's environment.
They said they intend to set up or support programs to reduce
air pollution, to preserve estuaries and wetland, and to
protect wild salmon habitat, Puget Sound and the area's
spectacular mountain and coastal scenery.
   "Caring for these treasures is our purpose," the sisters
said in the statement. ". . . Enhancing this foundation
through the sale of the company will fulfill many of {Dorothy
Bullitt's} and our dreams."
