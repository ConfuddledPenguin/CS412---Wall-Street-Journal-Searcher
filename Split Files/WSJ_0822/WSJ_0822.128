   U.S. Gold Corp. said it reached an agreement in principle
with Homestake Mining Co. to form a joint venture at U.S.
Gold's Tonkin Springs gold mining project near Eureka, Nev.
   Terms weren't disclosed. The agreement requires approval
of Denver-based U.S. Gold's senior secured bank lender and
its subordinated debt holders, and requires settlement of
existing liens on the property.

   Under the joint venture, the two companies will continue
to develop the project's bio-oxidation technology for
extracting gold from ore, and they will jointly own the
technology. Homestake of San Francisco will provide funds for
operating the project, which is currently cash-strapped, and
for further exploration at the Tonkin Springs property.
   The Tonkin Springs bio-oxidation project, which uses
bacteria to release gold from sulfidic ores, is the first
commercial application of the technology in the U.S. The
operation has produced about 2,000 ounces of gold, but
revenue has fallen far short of paying for the $31 million
project, which has been plagued by cost overruns and delays.
