   BONN, West Germany -- Siemens AG, an electrical and
electronics giant, said it obtained a contract valued at
several hundred million marks to deliver electro-technical
equipment for the Gresik gas and steam turbine energy plant
in Indonesia, as part of a 1.1 billion-mark ($702.5 million)
order granted by Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara, the
Indonesian state-owned energy works, to a consortium led by
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan.
   Siemens said the contract calls for delivery of 12
generators, high-voltage switch gear and 18 transformers.
Siemens plants in Muelheim, Berlin and Nuremberg will
