   NEW YORK -- Bond prices gyrated in nervous trading,
reacting to changes in interest rates and news reports out of
the Middle East.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 3/4
point in early trading, but rebounded during midday to end
slightly lower. The yield on the bond ended at 8.94%,
slightly higher than Monday's 8.93% closing yield. Mortgage
and tax-exempt municipals underperformed the Treasury market
and posted modest losses.

   But junk bonds posted moderate to sharp declines, taking
their cues from the troubled stock market. Most top-tier junk
bonds posted declines of 1/2 to 3/4 point, while prices of
many middle-tier and lower-tier bonds sank one to two points.
   The bond market opened lower on rumors, later denied, that
a U.S. warplane had been shot down over the Persian Gulf. The
prospect of war between the U.S. and Iraq alarmed investors
because it raised the chances that oil prices would rise
further, which in turn, would put more upward pressure on
inflation.
   But as the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond exceeded
the psychologically important 9% level, the market began to
bounce back.
   "The market was getting ahead of itself on the sell side,"
said Steve Ricchuito, economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd
Securities Inc. "When the yield went above the 9% level, the
market started to attract interest from investors," he said.
   Bonds continued to rebound when Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein hinted that he may be willing to reconcile
differences with the U.S.
   "We had some indications that the Iraqi annexation of
Kuwait might be negotiable," said Lincoln Anderson, economist
at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "That contributed to the bond market
rally."
   Oil prices, which lead bond prices in the inverse
direction, fell after Mr. Hussein's remarks, giving the
fixed-income market an added boost.
   A decline in the closely watched federal funds rate also
sparked some modest buying in the Treasury market. The
decline in the rate banks charge each other for overnight
loans occurred shortly after the Federal Reserve executed $2
billion in customer repurchase agreements. The rate fell from
8% to as low as 7 3/4%.
   The intervention came as a surprise to the market.
Although many economists said the Fed action was probably
technical in nature and designed to offset reserve shortages
in the banking system, "many people think there may be a Fed
ease afoot," said an economist at Shearson Lehman Government
Securities Inc.
   One reason investors may have been suspicious is that
members of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee met yesterday to discuss monetary policy and
consider whether the time is right to lower short-term rates.
   Adding speed to the upward swing in bond prices was buying
on the part of speculators who had taken short positions by
selling borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back at a
lower price and pocketing the difference. When the market
rose instead, these investors scrambled to unwind their short
positions.
   Dealers said trading dried up in the afternoon, with
government securities drifting at slightly lower levels.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended slightly lower at 97
30/32, compared with 97 31/32 Monday. Short-term securities
also posted small declines. The latest two-year notes ended
at 99 21/32, down from 99 23/32 on Monday. The yield on the
two-year notes rose to 8.17% from 8.14%.
   Treasury bill rates were slightly higher when compared
with Monday's average auction rates. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.58% yesterday for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.82%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.48% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.86%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The junk bond market mirrored the stock market, falling
sharply as equity prices plunged.
   Top-quality high-yield names ended 1/2 to 3/4 point lower,
while middle-tier and lower-tier junk bond issues were
battered even more and tumbled more than one point.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 52.48
points to end at 2603.96.
   Among the issues that were hard hit yesterday: RJR
Nabisco's 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which
ended down 2 3/8 points at 108 1/2 after falling as low as
108 on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures closed down 2 1/2 points at 84 3/4
after sinking as low as 82 5/8.
   Because equity arbitrage accounts are heavy investors in
RJR's pay-in-kind bonds, the securities tend to plunge
whenever the stock market tumbles, and they surge when equity
prices soar.
   Recession-prone junk bonds continued to take a beating
yesterday. American Standard's 12.875% senior subordinated
debentures, maturing in 2000, skidded 1 3/4 points to 88 1/4
after losing three points Monday.
   In a recent report, Citicorp Securities Markets Inc. said
the company would be negatively affected by higher interest
rates and surging energy costs because it relies heavily on
energy in making plumbing ceramics.
   Junk bonds of another building materials manufacturer,
USG, also sank. The company's 13.25% senior subordinated
debentures closed at 51, down two points.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds of AmBase plummeted after Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it has changed the direction of
its review of the company's debt ratings to possible
downgrade from uncertain. Ambase's 14.875% senior
subordinated notes lost 8 3/8 points to close at 71 1/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange after plunging nearly 15 points
in active trading last week.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Yields on some West German government bonds exceeded 9% as
international investors continued to dump their holdings.
   Among new issues, West Germany issued 10-year bonds
yesterday for its postal agency that had a coupon rate of 9%.
   That was the highest coupon seen on government or
government agency debt in eight years.
   Although domestic investors were big buyers of the postal
bonds, statistics compiled by the nation's central bank show
that foreign investors have been selling large amounts of
West German bonds this year. The Bundesbank said
international investors sold a net 8.4 billion marks ($5.37
billion) in the first six months of 1990, a sharp reversal
from the 22.5 billion marks of bonds they bought in 1989.
   The selling was sparked by fears stemming from monetary
union between East and West Germany.
   It comes just as West Germany's borrowing needs are
expected to soar because of East German-related expenses.
Private economists see net public sector borrowing around 80
billion marks this year and 120 billion marks in 1991,
significantly above pre-monetary union forecasts of 40
billion marks for this year.
   The last time foreigners were net sellers of West German
bonds was nine years ago, when they sold a comparatively
paltry 1.45 billion marks of bonds.
   In trading, West German bonds ended modestly lower. The
benchmark 8 3/4% bond due in 2000 fell 0.17 point to 98.60 to
yield 8.96%. The 8 1/2% bond due in 2000 fell 0.07 point at
96.70 to yield 9.01%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals

   Municipal bonds ended as much as 3/4 point lower.
   A rise in Treasury market yields above 9% and oil price
declines pushed tax-exempt issues into a tailspin, traders
said.
   While Treasurys later recovered, municipals were unable to
reverse the downward trend.
   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018
was 3/8 point lower at 97 5/8 bid to yield 7.37%.
   "We're just catching up to governments," one trader said.
"We weren't trading off as much as Treasurys had been, and we
just had some people selling because they thought the market
was going to go weaker" because of the Persian Gulf crisis,
he added.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage securities market posted losses after staging
a considerable rebound from the most depressed levels of the
day in sympathy with the gyrations of the Treasury market.
   After being down as much as 5/8 point, 9 1/2% pass-through
securities for September delivery issued by all three
agencies were down 7/32.
   The volatility has kept many inactive, market players say.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is
offering $501 million of floating-rate and inverse
floating-rate funding note pass-through certificates through
Lehman Brothers.
   The issue is the agency's third funding note certificate
offering. But it is the first time that a transaction in the
secondary mortgage market has been structured with
recombinable inverse floater classes.
   Also, $218 million of home-equity loan pass-through
certificates, priced to yield 9.26%, are being offered
through Shawmut National Remic Trust 1990-A by Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co.
   Shawmut Bank is the seller of the underlying home equity
loans, and Connecticut National Bank is the servicer. Both
banks are units of Shawmut National, based in Hartford, Conn.
