   MGM/UA Communications Co. said it received checks totaling
$50 million from Pathe Communications Corp., the latest in a
series of payments toward Pathe's $1.3 billion acquisition of
MGM/UA.
   After MGM/UA receives payment on the checks, Pathe will
have paid $303 million cash toward the merger and will have
given MGM/UA a $75 million security interest in three films
slated by Pathe. Pathe must make another $50 million payment
Sept. 20, according to terms of the merger agreement.
