   David N. Bolger, a Ridgewood, N.J., investor, submitted to
First State Financial Services Inc. a proposal to ask
shareholders to eliminate or ease certain of the West
Caldwell, N.J., company's anti-takeover provisions.
   Mr. Bolger, who is part of a group holding 9.9% of the
savings and loan holding company, said the provisions
artificially reduce its stock price and insulate management
from market forces. Noting that company insiders control
almost 20% of the stock, Mr. Bolger said he wants to reduce
the shareholder vote required for a takeover to a simple
majority from 80%. First State officials declined to comment
on Mr. Bolger's proposal.

   In early August, Mr. Bolger said he wanted the board to
take action against officers responsible for what he asserted
was corporate mismanagement, waste of assets, misconduct and
breaches of fiduciary duty.
