   A federal judge capped at 20% the fees that asbestos
plaintiffs' attorneys can currently receive from the Manville
personal-injury trust.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court in Brooklyn
limited the fees in an order yesterday. For weeks, he has
hinted that such action might be necessary.

   Under a spending freeze ordered by Judge Weinstein a few
weeks ago, the trust can pay claims only to seriously ill
asbestos victims who are in "extreme financial hardship as a
result of asbestos-related diseases," and the 20% cap on fees
applies to these payments. The trust is prohibited from
paying all other settlements and judgments until Sept. 6,
when the judge has ordered it to disclose its plans for
refinancing.
   Although the cap on fees applies only to the hardship
cases at this time, the judge's order indicated that such a
limit may be extended to other cases. Previously, Judge
Weinstein has called on asbestos plaintiffs' attorneys to
reduce their fees, which are said to often total more than a
third of the claims.
   In his latest order, Judge Weinstein said: "The matter of
fees is now being considered in connection with a
restructuring of the trust's payment program." He added that
court discussions with plaintiffs' attorneys about the cap on
fees are continuing.
   Judge Weinstein has criticized the trust in recent weeks
because the trust's cash shortfall has prevented it from
paying current asbestos personal-injury claims for at least
20 years.
   The trust was set up as part of Manville Corp.'s 1986
bankruptcy-court reorganization; the reorganization plan
placed no restrictions on attorneys' fees collected from the
trust. The average claim paid by the trust has been $42,000.
   Most of the victims are former construction workers and
shipbuilders who were exposed to asbestos while working.
Asbestos, once widely used, causes cancer and respiratory
illnesses. Currently, more than 100,000 lawsuits are pending
against Manville and other former producers.
   The latest order authorized the Manville trust to decide
without court review which claims may be paid during the
spending freeze. The court also set standards for which
claims can be considered to be hardship cases.

   RETIREE'S HEALTH BENEFITS can't be cut for now, a judge
rules.
   A federal judge in Connecticut barred Societe Nationale
Elf Aquitaine from reducing a health-benefits plan that
covered a former senior executive of Texasgulf Inc. The U.S.
oil company was acquired by the Paris energy conglomerate in
1981.
   The dispute between Richard D. Mollison, who was the
chairman and chief executive officer of Texasgulf at the time
of the acquisition, and the French parent company is one of a
growing number of cases against companies that attempt to cut
retirees' benefits. Mr. Mollison retired in 1982.
   Similar suits have been filed against Primerica Corp.,
General Motors Corp. and Combustion Engineering Inc., now
part of Asea Brown Boveri AB. But this is believed to be
among the first in which a judge has granted an injunction
before a company reduced benefits. The injunction will remain
in effect pending the final outcome of the case.
   Under Texasgulf's health-benefits coverage, all employees
received 80% reimbursement for medical and health-care
expenses. Under a supplemental plan, senior executives
received 100% reimbursement. Mr. Mollison contended that the
supplemental plan also provided that upon retirement he and
certain other officers would continue to receive full
coverage throughout their lifetimes.
   Mr. Mollison sued Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and two
subsidiaries, Elf Aquitaine Inc. and Texasgulf, both of
Stamford, Conn., after receiving a letter from the units'
current chief executive officer informing him that the
supplemental plan would be abolished as of May 31, 1990. The
basic 80% coverage would remain.
   In his complaint, Mr. Mollison alleged that as part of the
merger contract Societe Nationale Elf Acquitaine agreed to
maintain all employee benefit plans then in effect. He
contends that terminating the supplemental plan is a breach
of that agreement and violates the federal statute regulating
employee benefits known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
   Richard Klapper of the New York law firm Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell, representing the defendants, said that the plan
applied to fewer than 25 of the top current and retired
executives and that the company decided it would be
"inequitable" to continue higher health benefits for them.
Mr. Klapper said that the company had not violated ERISA and
maintained the right to modify or abolish any benefits.
   In the decision, federal judge T.F. Gilroy Daly of
Bridgeport, Conn., said he was granting the injunction out of
concern that Mr. Mollison, who is 74 years old and has been
treated for cancer, would be harmed if the plan was canceled
before the trial.
   Marilyn J. Ward Ford, a professor of law at the University
of Bridgeport School of Law and a lawyer for Mr. Mollison,
said other former Texasgulf executives may join Mr. Mollison
as plaintiffs in the lawsuit or file their own actions.

   LAW FIRMS BENEFIT from economic sanctions against Iraq.
   New York's Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton registered
Aug. 13 as a foreign agent for the exiled government of
Kuwait. The firm is dealing with foreign-asset matters and
will represent Kuwait chiefly before the Treasury Department,
according to one partner, who asked not to be named for
reasons of personal safety.
   Several members of the Kuwaiti royal family are being
represented by the Washington office of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;
Pogue. Partner Norman Vander Clute said the law firm seeks to
sever private assets held by royal family members from any
companies controlled by the Iraqi government.
   Oil companies, investment banks, and other companies
likely to be pinched by the freeze on assets have hired law
firms including Washington's Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering and
Philadelphia's Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius.
   Some law firms are marketing their services aggressively.
A news release issued by Ruder Finn, a public relations firm
representing Washington's Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge,
"strongly" encourages reporters covering the U.S.
government's asset freeze order to contact Thomas Crocker,
who is of counsel with the firm. A release from Morgan Lewis
urges multinational corporations to develop "legal battle
plans to cope with a potentially conflicting maze" of
sanctions. "We're in the thick of it," says Michael
Calabrese, an associate at Morgan Lewis and co-author of
papers issued by the firm on the trade embargo.
   In many cases, the work amounts to guessing what the
assets control office will do in the future.
   "We try and tell the client where we think {the Treasury}
will come out" on asset questions, says Andrew Vollmer, a
partner with Wilmer Cutler.

   TWO RESEARCH SCIENTISTS indicted for conspiring to sell
trade secrets.
   The scientists were charged in Newark, N.J., with
participating in a scheme to sell information about the
manufacture of Schering-Plough Corp.'s interferon, a drug
used in cancer research, and Merck &amp; Co.'s ivermectin, an
animal anti-parasitic drug that as Mectizan is used to treat
river blindness in humans. Schering-Plough is based in
Madison, N.J.; Merck is based in Rahway, N.J.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said the defendants had
tried to sell secrets about the processing of the
patent-protected drugs for a total of $9.5 million.
   The defendants, Bernard Mayles, who had worked for both
companies, and Mario Miscio, the director of Biopharm
Research Inc. in Hazlet, N. J., pleaded not guilty and are
free on bail.
   Neither Messrs. Mayles and Miscio or their attorneys could
be reached for comment.
   If convicted, each faces a maximum of 30 years in prison
and fines that can be as much as twice the gain to the
defendants or loss to the companies.
   The defendants were arrested this month when they handed
over a folder of documents and an ivermectin specimen to an
undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
exchange for $1 million in cash and $500,000 in bonds.
   The two defendants had sold the agent documents containing
partial information on how to manufacture ivermectin and had
negotiated a deal to sell information about interferon.

   NEW ENGLAND JUDGES will get environmental law training.
   The program for state judges is believed to be the first
of its kind and is expected to be a prototype for judicial
environmental education programs elsewhere in the country.
   It is being developed by the Environmental Law Institute,
a Washington, D.C., research and education organization, the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs and
the Flaschner Judicial Institute.
   The Flaschner institute, the judicial education arm of the
Massachusetts Bar Foundation, received a $46,500 grant from
the Jessie B. Cox Charitable Trust to develop the program.
   "There's a tidal wave of environmental litigation that's
about to break over the courts," said Andrew W. Savitz,
general counsel for Massachusetts' Office of Environmental
Affairs. He said that litigation resulting from an increase
in environmental legislation and recent efforts to enforce
environmental laws is now flooding the courts.
   John A. Pendergrass, a senior attorney with the
Environmental Law Institute said the program was planned so
that it can be adapted to the needs of judges in other
states. He said a judge and law-enforcement personnel in
California, Minnesota and Maryland as well as the American
Bar Association had expressed interest in the program.
   The first seminars will be offered next year.
