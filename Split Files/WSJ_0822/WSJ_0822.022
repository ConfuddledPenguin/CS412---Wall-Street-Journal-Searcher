   Portland, Ore. -- I was glad I'd had the experience of
nursing babies before I joined a pit crew at the CART/PPG
Indy Car World Series, when one of the series' 16 races was
staged here. Tips I gleaned at La Leche League meetings
served me well when I had to give nourishment to driver Scott
Goodyear each time he hurtled in for a pit stop.
   "He'll be helpless as a baby," warned Bob Hancher, manager
of the Canadian-sponsored Mackenzie Financial Corp. racing
team. "All he wants is his bottle, and believe me, when he
doesn't get it, he's mad."

   I imagined stroking his brow or cooing, which always
worked with my children, until I learned that I would be
nurturing Goodyear from the end of a pole. I was to slip the
water bottle into a little basket at the end of an eight-foot
metal pole, and plop it right in front of his face.
   This I was to do in the frantic first moments of the
12-second pit stop without striking other members of the
crew, without knocking the rear-view mirrors off the car, and
without bonking the driver's head.
   That was a lot to think about, but I also had to remember
what to do in the event of fire. "Run]" was the general
advice, but I was assured that being at the end of an
eight-foot pole, rather than directly next to the car on the
other side of the concrete wall, would give me a head start.
Because burning methanol fuel isn't visible, I was told to
look for certain clues, such as people diving into coolers,
throwing water on each other, and the like.
   After I donned my protective fire suit, I joined the crew
for a pre-race practice. The sleek blue car, which soon would
be moving around the track at nearly 200 mph, was just
sitting there. Hancher timed us with a stopwatch as the crew
changed all four tires and simulated a fillup with an empty
fuel hose, while I artfully lowered and raised my pole.
   Once the race began, I could relax. The car wasn't
scheduled for a first pit stop until after 35 laps on the
two-mile course. But the mechanics who'd be going over the
wall to fuel the car and change tires stood at the ready, in
fire suits and fireproof, head-to-toe underwear that covered
all but their eyes.
   Most of the crew wore headsets with which they could
communicate with the driver, thus learning, for example, if
he required an unscheduled pit stop. Otherwise, there would
be plenty of warning, with someone calling out, "Pit and two
laps . . . pit and one lap," as the time drew near. Hancher,
on the opposite side of the pit lane, next to the track,
would hold up a large sign reading "PIT."
   Suddenly, without warning, someone yelled, "He's coming
in]" I grabbed the water bottle, jammed it in the basket,
raised the pole . . . and catapulted the bottle clear across
the pit. Nobody noticed me scrambling for it on the ground.
Lucky for me, it was a false alarm. Goodyear thought one of
his tires was bad, but changed his mind. It had given me the
precious opportunity to learn proper pole handling.
   I felt more confident when the first pit stop actually
occurred. My pole ready, I held it at a 45-degree angle, but
well over the heads of the waiting crew. I glanced around the
fuel tank to watch the approaching blur of blue grow larger
and louder.
   At such high speeds, it's likely that a driver could
overrun his stop. But Goodyear knew to look for a neon pink
cap worn by one of the crew, plus a neon green Mackenzie sign
on the end of a pole held by Molly Shierson, the 20-year-old
daughter of the car's owner. Ms. Shierson and I were careful
not to tangle poles.
   Suddenly, the car was in front of me and the driver was
looking straight ahead, waiting for his water to appear. I
was not aware of the flurry of activity around me. At that
moment, the world contained only me and Goodyear. I lowered
my pole and we were linked.
   His arms, cramped in the womb-like driver's compartment,
reached forward to take the bottle. I raised the pole, with
its empty basket, and stood back. I had been told to move
back quickly, in case of fire, but it was important for me to
see that he enjoyed his drink. He slipped the bent, hard
plastic straw through an eyehole in his fireproof underwear,
pulled it down to his mouth and drank.
   Of course, it's an ancient maternal tradition to then ask
the recipient of one's benevolence, "Did you like it? Was it
good? Would you like me to serve it again sometime?" But
Goodyear kept his engine running and wouldn't have heard me
anyway over the din.
   When he was done he threw his bottle. I'd had plenty of
previous experience with this behavior, so I was not
dismayed. I fetched the bottle and noticed teeth marks on the
straw, showing that he bit while drinking. They taught us
about that, too, at La Leche League. Goodyear roared back
into the fray, and for a while it looked like his brief
refreshment had done wonders. He zoomed from 12th place to
10th. Then things began to sour.
   First his steering started to stick, then the engine made
odd noises. After his third pit stop, he didn't even make it
to the end of pit row before the engine gave out completely.
   After 49 laps out of 104, our race had been run. Goodyear
stepped out of the car, took off his helmet, and to a gaggle
of television cameras, said things like, "You win some, you
lose some," and "Tomorrow is another day."
   I got a tear in my eye watching him stand there alone. By
then the car had been rolled away and most of the crew had
skulked off to the team trailer. Meanwhile, our neighbors on
pit row, Michael and Mario Andretti, went on to win first and
second place.
   Back at the trailer, away from the TV cameras, Goodyear
explained to us what really happened:
   "The engine went pu-too, pu-too, pu-too, and then it
hiccupped," he said.
   (Oh my gosh] Was I supposed to burp the car after the
bottle?)
   Then, I just had to ask him . . . How'd I do at giving him
his bottle? He told me I'd done a great job.
   Naturally. As only a mother can.
