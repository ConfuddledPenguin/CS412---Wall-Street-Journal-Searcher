   NATICK, Mass. -- Prime Computer Inc., a computer maker,
said it will adopt MIPS Computer Systems Inc.'s reduced
instruction-set computing, or RISC, microprocessor technology
in a new line of computers, as part of a technology
partnership with the Sunnyvale, Calif., microprocessor
designer and computer systems maker. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The RISC chips will be at the heart of Prime's EXL 7000
system, based on a version of the industry standard Unix
software operating system, Prime said. Separately, Prime said
it introduced transaction-processing software for its
Unix-based computer systems.
