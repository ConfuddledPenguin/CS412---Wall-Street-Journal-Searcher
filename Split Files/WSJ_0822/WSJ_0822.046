   WASHINGTON -- A National Research Council study gave a
boost to proponents of small satellites, who have criticized
plans to spend as much as $50 billion over 25 years on a
series of huge satellites to study the earth's climate.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to
launch two $3 billion satellites near the end of the decade
to study the changing global environment. Each of the
satellites, called Earth Observing Systems, or EOS-A and
EOS-B, would be replaced at five-year intervals to get a
15-year environmental record of Earth.

   Critics say the satellites are too expensive and too
risky. If an EOS satellite should fail during launch or in
orbit it could wreck climate research because, the critics
contend, so many instruments are concentrated on a single
satellite.
   The National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan
Quayle, has said it shares the concerns of the critics and is
considering whether to restructure the project. The White
House turned to the National Research Council, a part of the
National Academy of Sciences, to get an appraisal of EOS
before deciding whether to make any changes.
   The research council's report supports EOS generally, but
says that a series of smaller satellites, which are scheduled
for launch before EOS, should take precedence over the larger
ones. Those satellites are intended to continue studies of
the ocean and atmosphere. "If budget constraints arise, it
would be more desirable to delay the launch of EOS spacecraft
than to forgo or diminish the effectiveness" of the smaller
satellites, the report said.
   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Bush
administration is asking Congress for $235 million for the
EOS program and $25 million for the smaller satellites.
   NASA has proposed putting as many as 16 different
instruments on each EOS-A and EOS-B. The report said NASA has
demonstrated that its plan makes sense for EOS-A, but hasn't
yet shown a need to put all the EOS-B instruments on one
satellite. The space agency could carve EOS-B into a number
of "smaller, independent satellites," the study said. EOS
critics have urged such a move to simplify EOS design and to
reduce the harm to the climate research program if one of the
satellites should fail.
   The study also warned that the biggest technical challenge
to EOS lies in building a computer system on the ground
capable of handling, storing and disseminating the vast
amounts of data the satellites will relay from space. The
ground-based computer system must be powerful enough to
handle a Library of Congress worth of information every month
or so.
   "While the importance and challenge of {the computer
system} are understood, it is not equally clear that the
route to achieving such a system and the resources and
advance planning required are fully appreciated," the report
said.
