   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mixed yesterday, having
slowly recovered after earlier gains were erased in a rush.
   The day's dollar bidding first changed course just as a
second day of gains had pushed the greenback to levels it
hadn't seen in a week. After the quick tumble, the dollar
resumed its slow appreciation.

   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5645 marks,
slightly below 1.5650 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S.
currency climbed to 146.65 yen from 146.44 yen in New York
late Monday. Sterling fell to $1.9115 from $1.9135 late
Monday. The U.S. unit ended at 1.2917 Swiss francs, down from
1.2964 francs late Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 146.53 yen, down a bit from 146.55 yen at the close there
Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5642
marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5666 marks.
   The session's gyrations Tuesday showed the underlying
weakness of the U.S. unit. Dollar gains in the past month
have been plodding -- except immediately upon Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait -- while declines have been fast.
   Dealers said comments by a Swiss central bank official
that the nation's attractive interest rates would remain firm
encouraged buying of the Swiss franc in the late European
afternoon.
   Demand for the Swiss currency, traders said, made the mark
a bargain in non-dollar cross bidding. Money was moved into
the German currency and out of the dollar, and the
greenback's general descent had begun.
   As dealers sold down the dollar, they found reasons to do
so, turning the correction into a full retreat. The New York
Stock Exchange opened weakly, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average quickly dropping 75 points.
   Meanwhile, a seemingly conciliatory, open letter from
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to President Bush was read on
television. Saddam Hussein said Mr. Bush should look for ways
to achieve peace and not rush into war. He also insisted that
Iraq had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia.
   Speaking at the same time at a news conference in Amman,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz offered to "sit and
discuss" the "whole Gulf situation."
   Most currency watchers agree that peace is good in the
long run for the dollar, because a drawn-out military
standoff would further weaken the staggering U.S. economy.
But, in the short run, the dollar would lose if investors
found they had no need for a safe haven.
   By midafternoon, however, "the peace euphoria wore off"
and the dollar stabilized, said Keith Raphael, a Chase
Manhattan vice president for foreign exchange. As did the
White House, financial markets finally rejected Saddam
Hussein's letter as rhetoric at best and, at worst, an
attempt to divide the Western alliance facing Kuwait's
occupiers, said Mr. Raphael.
   The industrial average also recovered, closing down 52.48
points to 2603.96.
   Gold's hard fall from its intraday high of $415.85
heartened dollar buyers, said Joe Sabbagh, chief currency and
metals trader for European American Capital. He suggested the
traditional, inverse relationship between the dollar and gold
reasserted itself toward the end of New York currency trading
yesterday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for
current delivery settled at $407.40 an ounce, down $2.70.
Estimated volume was a very heavy 7.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $406.05 an ounce.
   Rhetoric and rumors can still cause "blips up" by the
dollar, Mr. Raphael said. An unfounded story that a U.S.
warplane has been shot down by Iraq lifted the dollar to its
intraday top of 1.5725 marks. But for sustained dollar moves,
either higher or lower, the market is looking for something
"concrete," said Leslie Puth, a corporate foreign exchange
trader for Banque Indosuez in New York.
   Mrs. Puth said that after the dollar's strong rally on
Monday, when it gained more than a German pfennig, many
market dealers had set their sights on reaching beyond 1.5800
marks yesterday. The rapid turnaround, she said "took a lot
of people by surprise."
   The mark-Swiss franc cross rate was closely monitored
throughout European and North American trading. The German
unit declined to 0.8256 francs by the end of New York trading
from 0.8282 francs late Monday.
   Most dealers around the world attributed the dollar's
strong start against the mark yesterday to nothing more than
a correction from recent declines. But some took note of the
worsening situation in East Germany.
