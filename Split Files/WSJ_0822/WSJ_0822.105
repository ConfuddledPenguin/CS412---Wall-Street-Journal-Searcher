   Good news from the office: Love is in bloom.
   But instead of secret sexual liaisons, this is about
"nonsexual love relationships" or "psychological intimacy,"
according to a new study. It's somewhere in the spectrum of
office connections between mentoring and full-fledged
affairs. Moreover, the study's authors argue, while people
usually think of these male-female bonds as inevitably
wreaking havoc at work and home, these relationships are good
for people, even for productivity. Most of the time.

   Three University of Michigan professors say their study
indicates that 23% of men and women in the workplace have
friendships that involve intense feelings of loyalty and
trust. The bond gives a couple support and inspiration at
work, helps them in their jobs, and sometimes enlivens the
atmosphere even for co-workers.
   The authors admit they are venturing into delicate
terrain. "Love, what a closet word it is in organizations]"
they quote Roger Harrison, who has written on leadership in
companies. "Far better to talk openly of those old
shibboleths, sex, money, and power, than to speak of love."
One woman surveyed said: "My 72-year-old mother says that
relationships like this one are unnatural." But she added:
"My husband says that I am lucky. I know that I am."
   Of the 1,044 men and women surveyed, 87% were managers,
569 male and 475 female. They ranged in age from 23 to 69
with a median age of 38, and had incomes ranging from $18,000
to $680,000, with a median of $50,000. The relationships at
work lasted a median of three years and over 88% of
participants were also married or in a "committed"
relationship.
   The study asked respondents to describe the relationship
with "the person of the opposite sex to whom you feel closest
at work." About 23% reported loyalty and affection so intense
that the study rated the friendship a "love relationship."
   Although none were consummated, about half were tagged
"Eros" relationships, characterized by "excitement and
infatuation." The other half, denoted by the Greek term for
spiritual love, were Agape relationships, equally intense and
important, but without the erotic charge.
   Of the balance, 5% reported sexual relationships and the
other 72% described more superficial relationships, from a
man who simply greeted a woman "good morning" and "good
evening," to those citing people whom they enjoyed working
with.
   The workplace, says Sharon Lobel, one of the co-authors,
is "fertile ground" for love, however it manifests itself. On
one hand, "people are always showing their best side." At the
same time, day-to-day pressures make them hungry for support
to "express vulnerability, fears about performance and {give
each other} feedback" on everything from company politics to
how to ask for a raise. "It's the feeling of belonging, of
someone caring," said one study participant, "of not having
to pretend, of being totally yourself."
   Some people wonder whether any intense, cross-gender
relationship can avoid cascading into sex -- and trouble. Hal
Johnson, vice president at Korn/Ferry International Inc., and
a former head of human resources at two major companies,
remembers many times when he called on the carpet someone
whose workplace affair was creating problems. "Every time you
confronted somebody with `this is really getting out of
hand,' the explanation was `Gee, we really were {just}
wonderful friends'" to begin with. On the other hand, he
reflects, intense, nonsexual friendships may just be less
visible.
   More women in the workplace, the professors emphasize,
don't merely mean more opportunity for affairs or such
problems as sexual harassment. Because women are more likely
to develop communal, confessional relationships, they say,
there is a new flavor to collegial friendships. One male
senior manager who worked very closely for three years with a
female subordinate, said: "I trusted her for input and help.
{There was} better understanding without the threat of
vulnerability another man might present."
   The settings most likely to breed Eros or Agape, says
Prof. Lobel, are those where workers put in long intense
hours, are often on deadline or are thrown together in
relative isolation. Start-up firms or those with a
"humanistic" culture that encourage teamwork are also ripe
for such connections, she adds.
   By their very nature, work relationships can be
deliciously intense, says Diane Olmstead, vice president of
USF&amp;G Realty Advisors Inc., who had such a friendship in a
previous job. "Your most energized hours are spent with that
person. You develop a work understanding, you speak the same
jargon, you don't even have to explain things. It's like
being in a club."
   Participants said that they refrained from sex, raising,
the study said, "one of the most obvious . . . questions":
Why? Those in Agape relationships more often cited moral
principles, while those in Eros relationships said they were
fearful about effects at home or at work or on the
relationship itself.
   Most respondents saw the relationships as a boon, making
them more creative, productive and happier at work. And in
some cases, the good feelings spilled over. "Co-workers . . .
seem to vicariously share our love/affection for each other,"
said one man. "The culture {in our company} is usually highly
competitive and secretive. This doesn't exist in our
department."
   Still, there can be trouble. Eros couples tend to arouse
the same suspicions as do office pairs who do have sex. It
went from "gossip and petty insinuations," said one woman,
"into full-blown accusations from upper management. I was
told to stay out of his office and to keep him out of mine."
   Managers do have to be sensitive, says Prof. Lobel, about
whether a close bond between two employees puts others at a
disadvantage. "It did make it harder to evaluate
performance," said a manager who had an intense relationship
with a subordinate.
   If a relationship is creating problems, says Prof. Lobel,
top management may have to intervene. But the prevalence of
these relationships, she adds, suggests that nepotism
policies, which prohibit married employees from working in
the same firm or even limit dating of co-workers, may be
beside the point. "We're saying, it's kind of unavoidable men
and women {will} love each other."
   Of course, not everyone agrees. One respondent sent his
survey form back empty, except for this notation: "I'm sure
I'm not the only one totally disgusted. This idea of
`nonsexual love' in the office is . . . putting ideas in the
minds of people who may have never thought of someone they
worked with as a possible `lover.' I sincerely hope that the
funding you received didn't come out of my tax dollars."
