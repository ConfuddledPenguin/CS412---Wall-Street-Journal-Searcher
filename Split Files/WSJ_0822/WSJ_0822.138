   Hoesch AG of West Germany, a diversified steel company,
said its first-half pretax profit rose 3.2% to 355 million
marks ($226.7 million) from 344 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales slipped 1% to 5.33 billion marks from 5.39 billion
marks. Sales in the manufacturing and industry technology
division rose 4.1% to 2.73 billion marks, and in its
automation sector climbed 22% to 256 million marks. But sales
in its steel division fell 1.7% to 1.95 billion marks, and in
trading and services declined 9% to 1.89 billion marks.

   Hoesch said that a slowdown in steel sales in several
countries, particularly the Soviet Union and China, led to
the decline in sales, but that this was partly made up by a
decline in raw materials prices in mark terms, owing to the
weaker dollar.
   For the full year, Hoesch said, it expects earnings to
reach the level for 1989, when profit climbed 31% to 76
million marks on a 28% rise in sales to 10.68 billion marks.
