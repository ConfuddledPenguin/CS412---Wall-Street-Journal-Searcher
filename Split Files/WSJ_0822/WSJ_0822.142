   BUSH REJECTED an Iraqi offer to negotiate as he prepared
to call up reserves.
   The president was expected to sign an order today
activating military reserve specialists as the White House
declared that "the world is united" in demanding the
unconditional withdrawal of Saddam Hussein's army from
Kuwait. Amid mounting tensions, the State Department
confirmed that at least 54 Americans are believed to be in
Iraqi custody. Bolstering the U.S. effort to choke Iraq
economically, nine West European nations authorized their
warships in the Persian Gulf to use force to back U.N.
sanctions against Iraq. U.S. officials said that Navy
interdiction efforts have forced many Iraqi vessels to stay
away from ports.
