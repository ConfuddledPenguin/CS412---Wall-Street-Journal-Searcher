   LOS ANGELES -- Carolco Pictures Inc. said it is
withdrawing its $100 million convertible subordinated
debenture offering, which was filed just last week.
   "While we believe that as structured, the convertible
debenture offering could be sold successfully in the
marketplace," said Carolco's president and chief executive
officer, Peter Hoffman, "the company isn't prepared to sell
stock at these current levels."

   A spokesman emphasized that the withdrawal wouldn't have
any effect on the entertainment company's operations or
production plans.
   Carolco's stock closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $8.375 a share, up 12.5 cents.
