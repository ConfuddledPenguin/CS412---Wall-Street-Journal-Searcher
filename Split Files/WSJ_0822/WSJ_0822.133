   The Travel Related Services subsidiary of New York-based
American Express will use Epsilon software, provide it to the
businesses that accept its charge cards, and market it to
others, said Ms. Bailey.
   Epsilon shareholders, who will receive 0.655 share of
newly issued American Express common stock for each Epsilon
share, approved the transaction at a special meeting Monday.
