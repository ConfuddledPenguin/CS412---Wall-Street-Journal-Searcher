   Vishay Intertechnology Inc., Malvern, Pa., said its bid to
acquire all of Crystalate Holdings PLC for about $52 million
was "rendered moot," but the company still hopes to buy
Crystalate's U.S. operations.
   Vishay, a maker of resistors, sensors and strain gauges,
made its original offer in April because Crystalate sought
help in trying to thwart a hostile bid by TT Group PLC. But
Vishay said its bid lapsed because of a lengthy delay by
British regulators. In the meantime, about 56% of the target
company's shares were tendered instead to TT Group, which had
bid only about $47 million.

   Despite that setback, Vishay said it intends to negotiate
with TT Group to acquire the two U.S. units of Crystalate, a
U.K.-based maker of resistors and automotive sensors. The
units, with a combined 10.4% share of the U.S. market for
fixed resistors, have combined annual sales of about $60
million.
   Felix Zandman, Vishay's chairman and chief executive, said
TT Group officials have indicated that "they are interested
in selling" the U.S. operations of Crystalate. "We still want
to buy, provided the price is right," he said.
