   TOKYO -- Daiei Inc. will link up with Excel Corp., the
livestock division of Cargill Inc. of the U.S., to raise
cattle in Kansas, an official of the Japanese supermarket
chain operator said.
   Daiei, which imports about 13,000 metric tons of beef
annually, predicts growing demand for beef when Japan's beef
import regulations are liberalized in April.

   The link with Excel will help Daiei secure a supply of
low-cost U.S. beef. Daiei is planning to import 3,000 head of
cattle in the first year and 5,000 in the second.
