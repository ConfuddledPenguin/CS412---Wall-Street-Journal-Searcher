   WASHINGTON -- Most Americans line up solidly behind
President Bush's Middle East policy. But there's a major
exception -- black voters.
   In The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted last
weekend, black and white voters agree on many propositions --
that the nation is heading for a recession, for example. But
they diverge sharply on the question of sending American
military forces to the Middle East. On that point, 74% of
white voters support the military action, but the approval
rate among black voters is only 41%.

   Why is there such a stunning split?
   Perhaps the most commonly voiced explanation by black
politicians and scholars is that the conflict in the Middle
East may divert desperately needed money for social programs
here at home.
   But there are several other possible explanations. Black
voters, some people suggest, may be concerned that young
black men may be among the first to go into combat -- and
among the first to die. Still another is the fear that if the
situation in the Middle East leads to a recession, blacks may
suffer economically more than whites. And finally, there is
the possibility that some blacks -- like the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who is seeking permission to fly to Baghdad -- may
feel a cultural affinity with Arabs. Mr. Jackson, who
initially backed Mr. Bush's Middle East moves, has lately
turned more guarded in his support.
   Negative black opinion ranges from mild criticism of the
president's action to furious indignation.
   William Childs of Tuskegee, Ala., a black pilot in World
War II, suggests quietly that "perhaps black voters feel
America is not doing enough here at home."
   Julian Bond, one-time civil-rights activist, worries along
the same lines. "This Middle East venture," he says, "erases
whatever chance we had of a peace dividend. It's gone, and I
think black voters more than most others understand that."
   Wali Muhammad, assistant to Nation of Islam Minister Louis
Farrakhan, is furious. "Our cities are devastated," he says,
"and the Bush administration won't spend any money. We know
all about getting our oil cut off -- it gets cut off in the
winter because we can't pay for it."
   Blacks may worry, too, that if war comes to the Mideast,
black servicemen may pay a heavy price, just as so many of
them did in the later stages of the Vietnam War.
   "Blacks look back at the history of the war in Vietnam,"
says U.S. Rep. Mike Espy (D., Miss.), "and many of them
remember it as a poor soldiers' war, with the rich kids all
winning deferments. Black people fear their sons may be the
first to die." Mr. Espy makes clear, however, that he
supports Mr. Bush's Mideast actions.
   "Blacks are generally less enthusiastic about the use of
force than whites," says Edwin Dorn, an analyst at the
Brookings Institution here. "It's something that's happened
in the last 15 to 20 years since blacks have become so
heavily represented in the armed services. Blacks see their
brothers and sisters becoming involved. With whites, it's
more a question of principles."
   "Neil Bush {the president's son} isn't going to Saudi
Arabia," says Mr. Muhammad. "Poor blacks are the ones who
will do the fighting." Saddest of all, he adds, "is that
blacks still have a better chance of dying in black ghettos
than they do of getting killed on the battlefields in the
Middle East."
   Mr. Bond suggests that there are so many blacks in the
armed services now "that most black people are likely to know
somebody who might have to go."
   In the Journal/NBC poll, blacks and whites show no
disagreement in their assessment of the possibility of a
looming recession; about 57% in both groups expect to see one
in the next 12 months. But blacks may believe bad times will
hit them harder. Another split in the poll between black and
white voters turned up on the specific point of using
military force in the Middle East should gasoline prices
surge to $2 a gallon. Only 25% of white voters thought that
would be a reason to use military force, against 48% for
black voters.
   Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor, suggests
this result may have as much to do with class as with race.
It's the same explanation, he says, for the sharp divergence
between black voters and white voters on the question of
approving President Bush's vacationing in Maine during the
crisis. The president's holiday plans met with 59% approval
among whites, but only with 21% approval among blacks.
   Congressman Espy also points out that blacks tend to be
suspicious about Republican politicians, and he says some
blacks believe Mr. Bush is intervening in the Middle East to
protect wealthy oil interests here at home. In a Journal/NBC
poll conducted last month, 44% of the black respondents
approved Mr. Bush's overall White House performance, against
71% for white voters.
   There is finally the question of black attitudes toward
Arabs and Arab nations. "Generally speaking," says Mr. Dorn,
"blacks are far more sympathetic to the positions of Arabs
and Muslims than white people. Blacks tend to feel that U.S.
policy is always biased in Israel's favor and is rarely
evenhanded toward Arab nations."
   Harvard's Mr. Kennedy agrees. "Blacks may see the conflict
with Iraq as America aligned against a Third World -- and
partly colored -- people, and blacks may not be so
sympathetic to that," he says.
