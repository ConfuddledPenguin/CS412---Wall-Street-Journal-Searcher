   IN TAKEOVER BATTLES, what costs are deductible?
   The IRS recently issued a "technical advice memorandum" on
the subject to an unidentified insurance company. The memo,
to be made public in October, says the company can deduct as
ordinary business expenses all its legal, investment-banking
and other fees relating directly to fighting an unfriendly
takeover bid by a real-estate holding company. But it can't
deduct as current expenses the costs of arranging a takeover
by a friendly buyer, or "white knight."

   The ruling "is very important because the stakes are very
high" and because some people feared the IRS might not have
allowed any costs, says Robert Willens of Lehman Brothers.
But it still raises complex questions, such as how to
separate costs of hostile and friendly takeovers. "It may be
difficult to determine when resisting a takeover ends
{deductible} and arranging for a white knight
{nondeductible}" begins, says Gilbert Bloom of Peat Marwick.
   Further guidelines may emerge when an appeals court rules
in a case involving the friendly takeover of National Starch
by Unilever in 1978.
                                                                                                       

   REWARDS FOR INFORMATION tempt more tattletales to tell the
IRS.
   Many more people are trying to take advantage of the IRS's
longstanding offer to pay for information that leads to
collection of additional taxes. A record 11,754 claims for
rewards poured into the IRS in the year ended Sept. 30. That
was up 50% from three years ago. Ex-spouses and disgruntled
employees are among the typical informants. The maximum
reward is $100,000. IRS officials say informants' tips
enabled them to collect about $72 million last year.
   But the IRS says few tips are good enough to merit
rewards. Since 1967, it has received about 134,000 reward
claims. It paid rewards to only about 12,000, or 9%. Total
payments: $15.2 million. The reward size depends on how
valuable the IRS considers the tip to be, and is based on a
sliding scale. Last year, the IRS paid about $1.5 million on
519 tips, or an average of $2,931 apiece. Tipsters are
guaranteed anonymity. Rewards, naturally, are taxable.
                                                                                                       

   TAXPAYER GRIPES reach trial more quickly as court's
backlog shrinks.
   The number of pending Tax Court cases fell 38% to 52,332
at the end of July from more than 84,000 about four years
ago. "We are getting cases to trial considerably faster in
most cities," says Tax Court Judge Mary Ann Cohen. Many
taxpayers now have their day in court within nine months of
filing their petition, and "most" cases are scheduled for
trial "within a year," says Charles Casazza, the court's
clerk.
   Four years ago, taxpayers in major cities often had to
wait more than a year for a trial. Changes in tax laws and
streamlined court procedures have helped cut the caseload. So
have tougher penalties against frivolous cases, some lawyers
say. Tax-shelter cases have fallen due to consolidations and
key test-case rulings. Although many shelter cases still clog
the courts and IRS, most major questions have been "resolved
conceptually," says Bill Raby, a senior lecturer in taxation
at Arizona State University.
   "The court's backlog is getting under control, and
tax-shelter issues are no longer a big factor," Mr. Raby
says.
                                                                                                       

   TAX AMNESTY programs have generated about $1.5 billion in
31 states and the District of Columbia since 1982, says a
report by the Federation of Tax Administrators. Connecticut
hopes to raise $10 million with a three-month amnesty
starting Sept. 1. It will allow payment of back taxes and
interest without penalty or prosecution.
                                                                                                       

   NEW YORK accuses 81 antiques dealers of failing to comply
with state sales-tax laws. Agents swooped down on merchants
at an antiques show last weekend. They were charged with
misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of
up to $10,000. Cases will be heard Sept. 10.
                                                                                                       

   REGULATION WRITERS at the IRS needn't fear running out of
work. At midyear, they faced 426 regulations to be completed.
A few projects date back to the 1976 tax law. But their
workload is down from 428 at the end of May and 543 as of
Dec. 31.
                                                                                                       

   THE GOVERNMENT WINS more cases against tax protesters
filing phony forms.
   Government officials are fighting back against protesters
and others who mail false forms to the IRS. In typical cases,
protesters send in bogus 1099 forms showing fictitious
payments to their enemies, such as prosecutors, tax
officials, or bankers. Prosecutors say protesters are trying
to use the tax system to harass foes and create needless,
costly work for the IRS. Some people also filed phony tax
returns seeking huge refunds linked to bogus 1099 forms.
   Convictions for false statements recently were handed down
in Albuquerque, N.M., against Peggy R. Williams, Graigory
David Olson and Jean R. Canon, the Justice Department says.
Sentencing is set for late September and October. Among Peggy
Williams's targets: U.S. Judge Juan Burciaga and William
Lutz, the U.S. Attorney in New Mexico. Mr. Lutz received a
phony form claiming she had paid him $16,167,005.29.
   Several other people in other states were convicted
earlier this year of filing false documents.
