   CF INCOME PARTNERS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (Los Angeles) --
Jeffrey H. Lynford, 42 years old, was named president and

continues as chief financial officer until a successor is
named; the vice chairman title will be dropped, a spokeswoman
said. Mr. Lynford is chairman of Wellsford Group Inc., an
affiliate of New York-based Wellsford Capital Partners
Limited Partnership, which acquired 20% of CF Management in
December. CF Partners is a real estate investment concern.
