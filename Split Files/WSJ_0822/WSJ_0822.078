   U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
Special Drawing Rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign
currencies -- at the IMF.
   The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $163
million in July to $47.46 billion, while its gold reserves
decreased $1 million to $11.064 billion.
   U.S. holdings of IMF Special Drawing Rights last month
rose $209 million to $10.70 billion, and its reserve position
at the IMF increased $237 million to $8.69 billion.
   The Washington-based IMF supervises a supply of money
supported by subscriptions from member nations for the
purpose of stabilizing international exchange and promoting
orderly and balanced trade. Member nations may obtain foreign
currency when needed, making it possible to correct temporary
maladjustments in their balance of payments without currency
depreciation.
