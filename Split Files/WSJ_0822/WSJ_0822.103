   Directors of Stockholm-based Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, or SE Banken, approved a 577 million Swedish kronor
($100.1 million) issue of new shares to three Nordic banking
allies, a long-awaited move allowed by the recent abolition
of a ban on foreign ownership in Swedish banks.
   The action puts the final touch on Scandinavian Banking
Partners, a six year-old alliance of SE Banken, Unibank
Denmark, Union Bank of Finland and Den Norske Banken, which
extend customers access to one another's branch networks,
operate a joint cross-border payments system and join forces
in Scandinavian corporate finance activities. The partners
agreed in 1984 to swap stakes in one another.

   SE Banken's offering represents a 2.5% stake, with Union
Bank to get a 1.1% holding and Unibank and Den Norske Banken
0.7% each. SE Banken said the newly issued shares equal the
combined value of its 3.2% stake in Union Bank, 3.7% in Den
Norske Banken and 1.4% in Unibank. The banks will pay 88.42
kronor for each new SE Banken A-free share, which has 1/10th
of a vote. Each SE Banken A-restricted share has one vote.
