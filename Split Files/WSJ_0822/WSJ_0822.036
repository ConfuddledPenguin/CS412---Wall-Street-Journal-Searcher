   TOKYO -- Japan's Foreign Ministry denounced a new U.S. law
curtailing U.S. shipments of unprocessed logs, and warned
that the measure raises broader questions about the
reliability of the U.S. as a supplier of goods.
   In a sharply worded statement issued in response to
President Bush's signing Monday of the 1990 Customs and Trade
Act, the ministry called the act a betrayal of previous U.S.
commitments to expand trade in forest products with Japan.

   A provision that has caused the stir makes permanent a ban
on the export of unprocessed logs taken from federal forests
in the Western U.S. and restricts the export of logs taken
from state lands in the area. While this was promoted as a
conservation measure to protect owls, it would also protect
some lumber mills in the Northwest that have been losing jobs
to Japanese mills.
   U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, who is in
Tokyo couldn't be reached for comment.
   The ministry said that the move would raise uncertainties
about the Japanese lumber industry's pricing and availability
of certain kinds of lumber. The ministry expressed doubt
about U.S. assertions regarding the move's environmental
reasoning since export of processed forestry products wasn't
curtailed and questioned the law's compatability with the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   The U.S. is the largest supplier of unprocessed timber to
Japan, followed by Malaysia and the Soviet Union, officials
said. Most of Japan's imports of forestry products from the
U.S. are in the form of raw logs.
