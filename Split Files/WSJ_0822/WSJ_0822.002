   RIYADH -- One of the prime casualties of the Gulf crisis
is the ideal and illusion of Arabism. Although the "end" of
Arabism was proclaimed by some scholars a long time ago, it
took today's events in the sands of Arabia to confirm what
had been only an intellectual insight. In crises past the
governing elites in the Arab world shuddered at the prospect
of testing the loyalty of their citizens to what was
perceived to be fragile nation-states. But today the most
impressive manifestation of the Gulf crisis is the resilience
of these modern creations and their immediate and successful
claim to the loyalty of their citizens.
   Ever since the end of World War I and the emergence of the
modern Arab state system, Arab intellectuals (and presumably
the Arab masses) have challenged the new arrangements as the
unacceptable schemes of outside powers designed to fragment
the Arab nation. The creation of Israel and its dominance
over its Arab neighbors only confirmed that suspicion. Hence
the pressure to keep the facade of Arab unity and its
impressive manipulation by genuine Arab nationalists and
dangerous demagogues.

   Ruled by the Ottoman Empire for several centuries, the
Arabs seized the opportunity during World War I and struggled
to liberate themselves; thus the famed Arab Revolt and
Lawrence of Arabia. The revolt sought to unite the Arab lands
east of the Suez in a kingdom with the Sharif of Mecca at the
helm. The colonial powers had other plans and these lands
were divided into the existing states.
   But the dream lived on. During the 1940s Arab
intellectuals elaborated the theory of Arabism and several
Arabist movements and parties emerged, with Arab unity as
their legitimating ideology. Nasser's ascension to power in
Egypt in 1952 gave Arabism and Arab unity a powerful voice.
By direct appeal to the Arab masses through Cairo Radio,
Nasser terrorized other Arab leaders and threatened their
very existence, especially those who dared to be associated
with foreign powers (e.g., the Baghdad Pact).
   Other adherents to Arabism, namely the Baath Party,
eventually managed to achieve power in Syria and Iraq with
the conspicuous slogan of Arab "unity, freedom and
socialism." While they were exhorting the Arabs to unite,
they spent their energies scheming against each other.
   The 1950s witnessed the first concrete attempt to unite
the Arab states with union between Egypt and Syria, and other
efforts followed. All failed. But the illusion of Arab unity
still gripped the Arab imagination and few challenged its
premise, at least in public. The recent events in the Gulf
effectively buried this pretense.
   Saddam Hussein has resorted to the venerable cliches of
Arab unity to justify his grab of Kuwait, not an exceptional
matter in contemporary Arab history. What is surprising is
the reaction of those targeted for this forced union. As Arab
"nationalists," the Kuwaitis should have been only glad to
unite their land with another Arab country as one step toward
the ultimate unification of the Arab states.
   More significant are the events taking place in Saudi
Arabia. Every leader in the modern history of the Arab world
dreaded the time when he would have to ally himself openly
with a foreign power against another Arab country, let alone
cast his lot with the U.S., and the Saudis were no exception.
This fear was justifiable. The perceived fragility of most
Arab states ("tribes with flags" as they are contemptuously
dismissed) was an obvious factor, but probably not the
decisive one. Most Arab leaders very likely had to question
and fear the loyalty of their citizens to these "artificial"
states.
   The rhetoric of Arabism governed the general discourse in
intellectual, popular and governmental pronouncements and
therefore any conflict with an Arab country, especially one
that is carrying the mantle of Arab unity, became
problematic. Resort to overt Western military assistance was
beyond the pale. It was a sure way for a leader to be
devoured by his own rising masses in the cause of Arabism.
   It is clear today that this is not the case. Saudi Arabia
has openly asked for military help from the U.S. and there is
very little fear of internal dissent on this issue.
Surprisingly, there has actually emerged a solid consensus in
Saudi Arabia supporting the leadership's decision to invite
American troops. This is of fundamental historical
importance. For in the past some Arab countries did ask for
Western military support (e.g., Lebanon and Jordan in the
1950s), but the assistance was aimed, to a large extent, at
internal dissent fomented by the dreams and aspirations of
Arabism.
   Now thanks to Saddam Hussein, the dream (or nightmare) of
Arab unity is over. When the real test came, the peoples of
the Gulf and other Arabs opted for the continuation of their
states and spurned the embrace of Arabism. Even those
supporting Saddam's occupation of Kuwait seem somehow to be
enthusiastic for Kuwait's inclusion in Iraq but careful
enough not to press for the unification of their own
countries with Iraq, a point not lost to those on Saddam's
hit list.
   Regardless of what else we might learn from the Gulf
crisis, one lesson is already clear. Gone are the days when a
demagogue over Cairo Radio could arouse the Arab masses
against their own governments. Maybe Saddam's resort to
Islamic slogans is a recognition on his part of the
bankruptcy of the idea of Arabism, Palestinian demonstrations
notwithstanding.
   More important, the resilience of the Gulf states may
finally provide the needed assurance for the Arab world to
join the democratic revolutions of the 1980s. Secure in the
knowledge that their people's loyalty could not be
manipulated by outside forces in the name of Arabism, one
hopes that the perennially insecure Arab regimes may turn
inward and start the process of democratization. With such a
result many an Arab might actually be grateful for Iraq's
blunder in Kuwait.
