   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and the trading
house Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd. said they received an order for
a coal-handling facility valued at about 12 billion yen
($81.9 million) from National Technical Import &amp; Export Corp.
of China.
   The plant will be installed at Qingdao Port in Shantung
Province by the end of 1993, company officials said. The
order is part of a package of Japanese economic assistance to
China, awarded in 1984. The new plant will have loading and
unloading equipment capable of handling 15 million metric
tons of coal annually, of which 10 million tons will be
exported; a metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
