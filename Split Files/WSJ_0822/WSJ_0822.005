   European stock markets tumbled as rumors crackled across
telephone and Telex lines that hostilities had broken out
between the U.S. and Iraqi air forces and that freed-up
Kuwaiti investment funds had begun dumping European shares.
   Leading the decline was the German stock market, whose DAX
Index of 30 blue chips plummeted 85.73 points, or 5.2%, to
1549.96. The Paris Bourse's CAC 40 Index fell 4.1% to
1546.51, the Zurich Stock Exchange's Credit Suisse Index
declined 3.7% to 547.7, and London's Financial TimesStock
Exchange 100 Share Index retreated 2.3% to 2108.1.

   Even Mexico's stock market, which normally responds
positively to higher oil prices, sank 2.8% yesterday.
   Meanwhile the Nikkei Index of 225 issues on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at 26297.84, off
0.7%.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index sank another 1018.87
points to close the morning session at 25278.97.
   Peter Davies, vice president at Nomura Securities Co. in
New York, predicted that the downturn will spread to Tokyo
today, if only because on Tuesday Japanese stock-index
futures closed at a discount to the cash market in Tokyo
trading. "The implication is that this may induce selling
pressure at the market opening in Tokyo on Wednesday," he
   Several markets opened higher in Europe, only to come
tumbling down on a rumor -- later denied by the U.S. -- that
Iraq had shot down an American fighter plane. Stocks --
especially in Germany -- also fell on unconfirmed rumors that
the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, which reports to
and manages about $30 billion for the Kuwait Investment
Authority, had its funds unfrozen and that Kuwait Investment
Office was unloading some of its large stock holdings in such
companies as Metallgesellschaft AG, Daimler-Benz AG and
Hoechst AG.
   In addition, equity markets throughout Europe were
undermined by a statement by the editor of Jane's Soviet
Intelligence Review that Iraq had moved Russian-designed
ballistic missiles into Kuwait where they could threaten
Saudi oil fields and cities as well as U.S. troops. These
reports, which circulated earlier this month, largely were
disclosed yesterday, after Far Eastern markets closed.
   "These things become self-feeding," said Dennis Elliott,
head of U.K. institutional equity sales at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew Ltd. in London. "Sellers make sellers; the man in the
street reacts to headlines."
   So edgy are world stock markets currently, that "any rumor
is good at the moment," said John Wilson, head of corporate
dealing at James Capel &amp; Co. in London. When word spread that
a U.S. fighter plane had been downed, the London market
plunged 40 points, or nearly 2%, "in a couple of minutes," he
said. "And it never recovered. It tried to in the afternoon,
but because of the fact that Wall Street was going down in a
pretty straight line, it was never able to."
   Rosalind Altman, chief international strategist and
director of European equities at N.M. Rothschild
International Asset Management Ltd. in London, predicted:
"Markets will be volatile around a declining trend; it's too
early to call the bottom to any of these markets."
   With the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the world-wide
response to it, she said: "Things have changed, and they
haven't changed for the better. There will come a time soon
that there are very good bargains, but now is not a good time
to go piling in."
   The specter of rising oil prices, rising inflation and
higher interest rates have taken a steep toll on global stock
markets since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   "Investor sentiment focuses on the fear of the unknown,
and the big unknown is oil prices due to the geopolitical
situation in the Middle East," said Gilles Bazy-Sire, a first
vice president at Delahaye-Ripault S.A., the brokerage
subsidiary of Societe Generale in Paris.
   From the day before the attack through yesterday, the
German market has fallen 18.1%, Japan's 14.7%, Britain's
9.9%, France's 21.1%, Switzerland's 16.5%, and Italy's 18.3%.
Among smaller markets, Austria's is off 24.1%, Singapore's
19.8%, Belgium's 14.7%, Mexico's 14%, and Hong Kong's 12.4%.
   "The global stock village is under pressure," said Mr.
Elliott of UBS.
   With the 40% rise in oil prices in the past three weeks,
many analysts are now predicting higher interest rates in
many countries and a floor on how far rates can recede in
others, such as the U.S., where economies were already weak.
Higher interest rates squeeze corporate profits and raise
production costs.
   They also increase the attraction of fixed-income
investments. For instance, three-month Euromark deposits
currently yield 8.44%, while German shares yield about 3.5%.
"You're going to need a lot of persuasion to stay in equities
over bonds," said Mr. Elliott.
   Traders, analysts and investors in Europe keep telling
themselves that some recovery -- at least a mini-bounce --
must occur at some stage. "But," said Mr. Wilson of James
Capel, "everyone is waiting with baited breadth to see what
{President Bush} will do. The feeling in the market is that
the sooner he strikes the better." Mr. Wilson added that what
traders and investors fear most is "that it will turn into a
three, six, nine month period of attrition."
   "Good quality stocks appear to be getting cheaper by the
day," added Mr. Wilson. "People were saying the {London}
market was unlikely to fall below 2380 10 days ago; then the
feeling a week ago was that there'll be good resistance at
2200. Now the market's on the verge of breaking 2100."
   Mr. Bazy-Sire of Delahaye-Ripault said that the difference
between current market conditions and those of the global
stock market crash in October 1987 was that "there is no
feeling of panic." Yet he conceded that "we've been losing up
to 4% or 5% nearly every day."
   Not all problems can be traced to the Middle East crisis
and higher oil prices. Germany's stock market, for instance,
has been plagued by the speed and scope of East Germany's
economic disintegration and the high cost it spells for West
Germany.
   In addition, political rifts in East Germany are adding to
the economic nightmare that has seen unemployment there rise
by 25,000 people a week and July retail sales collapse by 44%
from a year earlier. Analysts now predict that Bonn may have
to come up with nearly double the 30 billion German marks
($19.2 billion) originally allocated to cover East Germany's
budget deficit in the year's second half.
   "This isn't what the market wants to hear; it keeps up
interest rates and reduces confidence in the government,"
said Heino Roland, a stock market analyst at Bank Julius Baer
in Frankfurt.
   George Gabriel, head of foreign-equity trading at ABD
Securities, a unit of Dresdner Bank AG in New York, noted
that at 1549.96, the DAX Index is fast approaching the level
at which it stood just before the Berlin Wall came down in
November: 1441.79. "One more day like this {and} we'll be
there," he said.
   "We've passed through 1600, meaning that we are breaking
through support levels we thought could be held," said Nigel
Longley, a broker for Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. "There are
no buyers, and traders won't take any positions on their
books," he said.
   Some of this puzzles analysts. Mr. Gabriel, for instance,
points out that prospects for economic growth in West Germany
are good. "We are forecasting a 10% increase in earnings for
BMW, yet the stock is now at a five-year low," he said. "It's
absolutely insane."
   Similarly, Mr. Bazy-Sire of Delahaye-Ripault noted that
France consumes 30% less oil now than it did at the time of
the first oil crisis in 1973 and that 75% of the country's
electricity is currently supplied by nuclear power. In
addition, he noted that the government has stated that
everyone -- not just industry -- will share the pain of
higher oil prices this time.
   Traders said the steepness of the decline in Continental
European markets yesterday was exacerbated by low trading
volume and foreign investors -- particularly American and
British institutions -- dumping German, Swiss, French and
Austrian shares. German brokers said Japanese institutions
also were selling German stocks.
   "A lot of the selling is cross-border; it's rather
reminiscent of the days immediately after the October 1987
crash," said Mr. Elliott of UBS. "You are seeing U.S. fund
managers look at their portfolios and question why they own
certain stocks." Moreover, by selling British and German
stocks now, U.S. fund managers can lock in currency gains
from the dollar's fall.
   Investors are especially dumping stocks of European
companies that do a lot of business in the U.S. because the
falling dollar is expected to damage their profits.
   "These decisions aren't so much to repatriate money, but
they are sales based on a lack of logic to own. And the
locals aren't buying," said Mr. Elliott. A German broker
added that German banks weren't buying either. "When they
don't come in and buy for their own book and you have heavy
selling, you're going to have an ugly {West German} market,"
said one.
