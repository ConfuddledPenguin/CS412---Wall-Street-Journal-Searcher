   ST. LOUIS -- Y&amp;A Group Inc., citing current market
conditions, said its board has withdrawn the company's recent
registration statement relating to a proposed offering of 1.6
million common shares.
   The provider of engineering services to the electric
utility industry said increased bank credit facilities,
working capital and a possible private placement of its
securities will provide it with sufficient resources to
maintain its current business objectives.
