   NEW YORK -- Soaring oil prices have been a blessing for
some parts of Wall Street, particularly the trading house
Salomon Inc.
   Down the road, the Mideast crisis could undermine the
Street's bread-and-butter businesses of securities trading
and underwriting. But for now, an explosion of stock and
futures trading volume is helping various firms on the
Street. And the really big winner is Salomon, with its
thriving Phibro Energy Inc. unit.

   Not only does Salomon trade in the oil markets for its own
account and for customers, but it is one of the nation's
biggest petroleum refiners and has managed to keep profit
margins strong in that business, despite soaring prices for
crude oil, the raw material. Yesterday, Salomon said it
expects "unusually strong results" from its energy and
securities units in the third quarter.
   Salomon said it expects a "profitable" third quarter, even
after an anticipated $200 million charge from a stumbling
commodities unit. And Salomon's bond operations are believed
to be thriving in the wake of the Mideast crisis.
   Securities firms, already pinched by Wall Street's
recession, could eventually get pounded by fallout from the
Iraqi assault. The stock market has fallen nearly 10% since
the Arab nation's Aug. 2 march into Kuwait. Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and the Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit of American
Express Co. are among the firms that will be vulnerable if
stocks keep going down, prompting individual investors to buy
fewer shares and slackening the pace of new underwritings,
analysts said.
   Though several firms such as Morgan Stanley Group Inc.
make money helping clients reduce their exposure to oil-price
swings, "the only firm with a really direct part in oil
trading is Salomon," James Hanbury, an analyst for Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co., said. By contrast, many other securities
firms "will lose an edge off nearly every business -- retail,
dealmaking and underwriting," he said.
   Michael Goldstein, a Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst,
said Salomon should have the best earnings on Wall Street
this year. Yesterday, he raised his estimate of Salomon's
yearly operating earnings to $3.60 a share from $3.30, before
an expected one-time charge of about $1 to pare back the
company's struggling business in non-oil commodities, Philipp
Brothers Inc.
   The Mideast crisis "has been bad for the bond market, bad
for the stock market," Mr. Goldstein said. "It has created
quite a bit of activity in some markets. But overall, it's
hard to view it as a positive, except in certain instances
like {Salomon}, where it's a very clear positive."
   Crude-oil prices are zigzagging more sharply than usual.
Yesterday, they gyrated from $27.60 a barrel to $29.09,
finishing at $28.41 in heavy trading at the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Such volatility can cause some problems
for energy-futures brokers, but at the same time, it
generates more business for them.
   Options trading activity is picking up. Brokers said
options are increasingly popular, because the oil market has
become so "emotional," with big price swings on the slimmest
of news. Investors are well aware that the potential losses
on an option are confined to the amount of money invested,
while a futures-contract investor can lose much more. In
recent days, the activity in the gasoline market has picked
up, while natural-gas volumes remain surprisingly slim.
   After Salomon, a lesser beneficiary of the oil gyrations
appears to be Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. The private partnership
trades oil and petroleum products for its own account through
its J. Aron commodities division, and for customers through a
separate futures brokerage within Goldman Sachs. Brokers
familiar with Goldman Sachs say it is clear that customers of
the futures-brokerage operation have been much more active in
recent weeks.
   National brokerage firms that serve small investors also
have seen a pickup in oil-related trading, though probably
not enough to cause a significant improvement in
third-quarter earnings. One of those firms is Shearson
Lehman, which is among the largest Street brokers of energy
futures -- contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a certain
price by a specified date.
   Shearson Chairman Howard L. Clark Jr. recently said the
firm has "seen a big increase in the volume of {commodities}
business for customers" over the past month. The increase has
been felt in Shearson's London operations, as well. But
Shearson doesn't take big positions for its own account, so
analysts said it won't have the big profits that a Salomon or
Goldman Sachs might.
   Wall Street doesn't mind chaos, which usually is
profitable. Even as stock prices have plummeted on recession
fears augmented by the oil-price surge, volume on the New
York Stock Exchange has soared. After lumbering along with
fewer than 160 million shares traded on an average day, the
Big Board has enjoyed a string of 200 million-share days
(yesterday's volume was nearly 195 million.)
   "I don't think it's been a bad quarter," Lawrence
Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said. "The mere fact the market dropped doesn't necessarily
spell trading losses. You've had some pretty good volume
days."
