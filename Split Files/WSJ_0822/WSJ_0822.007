   For once, the Rev. Al Sharpton has it right. The three
young men who raped and nearly pummeled to death the jogger
in Central Park almost certainly should have gotten off.
Should have, that is, in the sense that without their
confessions there would have been almost no hard evidence
against them. Should have, because under the rules of our
Mirandaized justice system, it is amazing that there were
actual confessions, to police, on videotape.
   The twin set of 23-inch Sony Trinitron monitors transfixed
the jurors during the trial. One juror signaled the
importance of the videotapes when he said that if it weren't
for the time stamps on the tapes to help locate important
parts of the confessions, the jury may never have reached a
verdict. As it was, jurors watched one of the confessions
five times during deliberations. "We knew we couldn't give
up," another juror said, "even if we had to watch the tapes
10 times."

   The jurors were understandably persuaded by the
confessions. "We charged her. We got her on the ground.
Everybody started hitting her and stuff," Antron McCray said.
"Everybody stomping and everything . . . I grabbed one arm,
some other kid grabbed her legs and stuff. Then we all took
turns getting on top of her." Raymond Santana's tape
described the attack in even more horrifying detail.
   Lawyers for the defendants claimed the defendants had
somehow been coerced into confessing. One said a confession
should be suppressed because no lawyer was present as
juvenile rules require; the defendant had given the police a
fake ID saying he was 16. One argued that his grandmother
didn't understand the Miranda warning even though it was
given in Spanish. One said he was coerced "by the promise to
go home." The judge denied these claims, which could reappear
in any appeal.
   The Central Park trio might well have walked free if the
jury hadn't heard the confessions. The case against them was
remarkable for the near total absence of any physical
evidence individually linking them to the jogger. No weapon,
semen, blood, hair or footprints gave clear evidence. This
crime may have been so gruesome and committed by so many that
laboratory wizardry failed.
   The jogger trial is a reminder that forensic tools cannot
replace confession as the single best way of getting at the
truth. This is especially true in serious crimes where, as
here, no witnesses are left to testify except the criminals
themselves.
   Despite Miranda, the Constitution says nothing about
chilling voluntary confessions, and there is Judge Benjamin
Cardozo's famous rebuke of the idea that "the criminal is to
go free because the constable blundered." Other countries
protect rights against self-incrimination and unreasonable
searches while still allowing juries to consider truthful
evidence. This is why the revolution in the federal and state
courts during the past 30 years to suppress evidence,
including voluntary confessions, has been a dangerous
judicial conceit.
   It's pure luck that these three fell through the tight
netting of case law that makes voluntary confessions so hard
for the police to get. Recidivists in New York avoid any
temptation to confess under People v. Rogers (1979), which
prohibits police from even questioning a suspect if they know
he has a lawyer in another case.
   When Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) was a prosecutor in the
1960s, he estimated that 90% of people arrested for crimes in
Philadelphia made statements to the police before Miranda and
similar cases. Afterward, he estimated, the number fell to
about 40%. (As a senator, Mr. Specter has opposed reforming
Miranda.) Another study at the University of Pittsburgh Law
School found that the proportion of suspected killers and
robbers who confessed fell to 30% from 60% after Miranda.
   Interestingly, these court-ordered procedures have become
so ingrained that an American Bar Association study in 1988
found that a "strong majority of those surveyed --
prosecutors, judges, and police officers -- agree that
compliance with Miranda does not present serious problems for
law enforcement." There may be few cases that go to trial
only to be defeated by court rulings to suppress evidence,
but prosecutors aren't idiots. There is a huge number of
cases they settle or drop because they know key evidence will
be suppressed. When prosecutors decide not to bring felony
drug cases, one study found, 30% of the time it was because
of search-and-seizure problems.
   The great secret about the exclusionary rule is that it
has been overturned by legislation. The 1968 Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act responded to Miranda, which was
decided in 1966, by instead telling federal judges to apply a
five-point test to see if a confession was voluntary or
coerced. If it was ruled voluntary, then the jury would get a
special instruction to give the confession the weight "it
deserves under all the circumstances."
   This legislative reversal of Miranda, however, has been a
dead letter. President Johnson refused to enforce the law
because then-Attorney General Ramsey Clark preferred the
judge-made rules. This is a costly lost opportunity.
Wisconsin Court of Appeals Judge Ralph Adam Fine argues in
his book, "Escape of the Guilty," that this voluntariness
test makes a lot more sense than blunt technicalities barring
evidence. "Law enforcement throughout this country has
changed" since the 1960s, he says. "We are generations away
from the age when, in some jurisdictions, the `third degree'
was tolerated or even encouraged."
   Robert Morgenthau, the veteran Manhattan district attorney
whose office recorded the confessions and won the Central
Park jogger case, makes another point about videotaping,
which he calls the "most significant advance in law
enforcement in 20 years." This is that Miranda makes even
less sense now that jurors "can see the defendants themselves
and draw their own conclusions about whether or not a
confession was coerced."
   Former Attorney General Clark offers a freeze frame of the
liberal mind-set that dismissed an increase in crime because
of the exclusionary rule. In his 1970 book, "Crime in
America," Mr. Clark begins a chapter on confessions with
these words: "The history of confessions is full of torture,
treachery and lies." So much so, he says, that confessions
should be avoided. "Confessions also contain the same
psychological satisfactions that derive from punishment," he
wrote. "Such an impulse does not derive from a desire for
truth. It demeans human dignity. . . . Human dignity is the
central issue of our time."
   Here's a debate topic: Did the convictions of the Central
Park thugs add to or subtract from "human dignity"? All those
who think the verdict serves justice need to understand that
until the exclusionary rule is abolished, convictions through
confessions will be rare victories.
