   New York -- Denzel Washington is a screen actor of some
emotional breadth. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of a
Union soldier in "Glory" and currently is starring as a
single-minded jazz musician in Spike Lee's "Mo' Better
Blues."
   Starring in Shakespeare's "Richard III" (at Central Park's
open-air Delacorte Theater), however, Mr. Washington makes a
tepid villain. His performance is curiously lackluster, as if
his film roles have spoiled him for the more expansive acting
required on stage. There's little hint of the frenzied
ambition that drives Richard to murder after murder. Nor of
the sexual power that sweeps up two women who despise him.
Nor of the clear-minded calculation that directs his
evil-doing. Mr. Washington's rapid-fire delivery suggests
little emotion other than a wish to be home before midnight.
Richard usually is given a hump, but here Mr. Washington
suggests the king's deformity by slumping his shoulders and
keeping his left arm limp and his right leg straight. I kept
my eye on that right leg and am happy to report that during
the evening I was scrutinizing it, it fell out of character
and bent its knee only once.

   With a few exceptions, no one else in the cast deserves
more attention than that leg. Joseph Ziegler makes a
stirring, anguished Duke of Clarence, the brother Richard
arranges to have murdered in the Tower of London. Unhappily,
Clarence is dispatched in Act I. There's a long, dry spell
before Armand Schultz makes his appearance in Act V as the
stalwart Richmond, later Henry VII, who defeats the unhorsed
Richard on the battlefield. The women are uniformly dull,
especially Mary Alice as the dowager Queen Margaret, who
delivers her curses with about as much venom as the Queen Mum
declines a second cup of tea.
   This lusterless production is surprising, given that the
director is Robin Phillips, former artistic director of the
Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare Festival. There must be
better ways to benefit from the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement.

   It was with some trepidation that I entered the Ballroom's
tiny theater the other night to see "The Mask, Myth and Magic
of McBride." Jeff McBride is a master magician -- the
youngest recipient of the International Brotherhood of
Magicians' Star of Magic and winner of the Grand Prix Magique
de Monte Carlo. If your everyday, garden-variety stage wizard
can invoke a simple abracadabra to pull a rabbit from a hat,
I thought, there was no telling what was within Mr. McBride's
powers. At the very least, I prayed my notebook would spare
me from any audience-participation stunts. Clearly, a
critic's judgment would be impaired if she was subjected to
the indignity of having a Ping-Pong ball extracted from her
ear.
   I needn't have feared. Mr. McBride, who bills himself as a
"magical artist" or "magical visionary," isn't much
interested in ordinary magic. It's a shame, because when he
is, he produces stunning results. His opening card tricks are
dazzling, partly because he's a skillful illusionist but also
because, without uttering a word, he conjures up an
atmosphere that's eerie and elegant. Dressed in black and
wearing a skeleton-white mask borrowed from Japan's classic
Noh drama, he moves with reptilian grace to the accompaniment
of discordant electronic music. Mr. McBride is a splendid
stylist, often incorporating flamboyant elements from the
Japanese Kabuki theater -- a floor-length red lion's mane,
for instance. His trademark is masks, and a skit in which he
keeps removing one to reveal another is spooky and droll.
   The problems begin when he takes off his final mask and
launches into nutty New Age musings on the magic within us
all. A sampling: "Magic is the power that strips even the
masks that separate us," he intones in a thin voice that's
not suited for pomposity. Or, "Today's world needs magic, and
to heal this world we need as many magicians as possible."
   This New Age section clogs more than half of the show, and
Mr. McBride cheats a bit when it comes to the magic, letting
technology take over. His "temple of astral light," for
instance, owes its construction not to the skills of an
illusionist but to those of a lighting designer. In the
course of his solemn pieties, Mr. McBride manages to ply a
few of the ordinary tricks of the magician's trade -- he eats
some fire, makes a white dove appear from nowhere,
intertwines some metal rings -- but the stylish mood of the
opening scenes is gone, and the temptation to giggle is
great. For my part, I kept imagining what Shirley MacLaine
would look like sawed in two. Which half would be Shirley and
which of her previous incarnations would inhabit the other
half? I'd vote for the infant flown by an eagle to Africa.
   ---
   If I escaped being sawed in two in Mr. McBride's magic
show, it was only to be cut into little pieces by "Light Up
the Sky" (Roundabout), Moss Hart's hilarious savaging of
theater critics. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I found it an
entirely pleasurable experience.
   The plot takes place in an actress's hotel suite on the
opening night of a new play, just before the curtain rises,
just after it falls, and just after the first reviews come
in. The performances are all more than a bit outlandish,
which suits this zany play just fine. Notable are Charles
Keating, an accomplished Shavian actor, as the play's
histrionic director, and Bill McCutcheon in a cameo as a
drunk, stagestruck Shriner.
   Moss Hart was a virtuoso of the American theater; his
career as director and playwright encompasses some of the
greatest musicals, comedies and plays of this century. To
name just a few of his successes, he directed "My Fair Lady"
and "Camelot" and, with collaborator George S. Kaufman, wrote
nine plays, including "The Man Who Came to Dinner" and "You
Can't Take It With You." "Light Up the Sky," a solo effort by
Hart in 1948, is only half as witty and half as wacky as his
collaborations with Kaufman, but half of wonderful is still
pretty terrific.
