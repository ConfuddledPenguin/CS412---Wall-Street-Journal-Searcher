   Hasbro Inc., seeking to pull out of a sales slump,
announced a series of management changes, including the
surprise resignation of Stephen Schwartz, president of the
toy maker's Playskool division.
   Playskool, which makes mostly preschool toys, has helped
the company's overall performance with estimated sales of
$347 million last year, as the company's Hasbro division,
which makes toys like G.I. Joe, has suffered from a lack of
hits. In 1989 the Pawtucket, R.I., company had net income of
$92.2 million, or $1.56 a share, on revenue of $1.4 billion.

   Analysts say they are baffled by the reshuffling. Though
the company has been in a slump, the announcement comes at a
time when initial reports on sales of a number of new Hasbro
toys, like New Kids on the Block dolls and WWF wrestling
figures, have been good. Mr. Schwartz's resignation was
particularly surprising.
   "Steve Schwartz was one of the best marketing people I've
ever seen," said Alison Shinners, a former marketing
executive director now working at Ertl Co., a toy maker in
Dyersville, Iowa. "He knew what was out on the market and had
an uncanny ability to take a toy and make it better."
   The announcement was made after the market closed. By
then, Mr. Schwartz had left for the day and wasn't available
for comment, a secretary said.
   "My speculation is that Schwartz, who was tremendously
valuable to Hasbro, was upset that he didn't get the top post
{in the reshuffling} and left," said Sean McGowan, analyst
for Gerard, Klauer, Mattison &amp; Co. in New York. "I don't
think this should be viewed as being Stephen was forced out.
I think he was certainly doing a good job. I think there's
regret on the part of the company that this couldn't be done
without losing Shwartz," he said.
   Under the new management changes, Alfred J. Verrecchia,
currently co-chief operating officer and president of the
Manufacturing Services Division, will become chief operating
officer of the company's domestic toy operations. In that
role, Mr. Verrecchia, will have responsiblity for the Hasbro,
Playskool and Playskool Baby divisions.
   George R. Ditomassi will become chief operating officer,
games and international. He continues to be responsible for
the Milton Bradley division, of which he has been president.
   Among other changes, Barry J. Alperin, co-chief operating
officer, will become vice chairman.
   Messrs. Alperin, Ditomassi, Verrecchia and chief financial
officer John T. O'Neill will report to Alan G. Hassenfeld,
who remains chairman and chief executive officer.
