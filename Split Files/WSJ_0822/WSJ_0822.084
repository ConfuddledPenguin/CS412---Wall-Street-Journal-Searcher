   Airline pilots, worried about their image, are taking to
the airwaves.
   This week's news that three former Northwest Airlines
pilots were found guilty of drunken flying was another blow
to the reputation of commercial aviators. In recent years,
pilots have also been blamed for several crashes; in one
instance the crew was caught gossiping about flight
attendants just before the accident.

   To counteract this, the Air Line Pilots Association has
created a 30-second television advertisement and six
60-second radio spots to promote the image of pilots as cool
professionals who don't crumble under pressure.
   The television ad flips between an airline cabin, where a
little girl in blond pigtails plays with a teddy bear and
then naps serenely, and the cockpit, where pilots busily
perform their duties, professional even while flying through
fog. The ad ends with the girl running up to the captain and
showing him the fake wings she was given on the flight.
   "Look, daddy]" she says to the captain. "I have wings,
too."
   The image is in stark contrast to the one the public has
been receiving lately. Monday, a federal jury found the
former Northwest pilots guilty of flying a jetliner while
under the influence of alcohol -- the first drunken-flying
conviction of professional pilots.
   In fact, the public image of pilots took a nose dive after
the March arrest of the Northwest cockpit crew. While
boarding, some passengers would poke their heads into
cockpits and ask pilots, "Do you mind if I smell your
breath?" Comedians Jay Leno and David Letterman sprinkled
their monologues with one-liners about the arrests. TV
talk-show host Pat Sajak remarked: "We had sleet and hail in
Los Angeles last night. Either that or a Northwest Airlines
cockpit crew was having frozen Margaritas."
   There was even a joke making the rounds at Northwest's
headquarters: "How many Northwest pilots does it take to fly
a plane? Three and one-fifth." (The one-fifth refers to a
standard-size liquor bottle.)
   The pilots union acknowledges that many people think of
pilots as greedy, complacent and irresponsible. Pilots even
have a bad image among their own co-workers, who view them as
fat cats who earn higher salaries.
   "We would get pilots calling up, saying we need to do
something," says John Mazor, a spokesman for the pilots
union, which represents pilots at most of the country's
airlines. The first ads are expected to air in November or
December, at the earliest.
   This venture -- the first of its kind by an airline union
-- lacks Madison Avenue glitz. The union drew upon the
expertise of the AFL-CIO, known most recently for its "Union
Yes" ad campaign. Production costs were only $150,000. The
pilots union is relying on member donations totaling between
$1 million and $5 million to air the ads. Its board won't
finance the ads from membership dues.
   Other unions have turned to advertising to get their
messages out. The United Auto Workers ran several ads during
its latest round of contract negotiations with the big car
companies. But perhaps the most famous union ad is the
television advertisment in which members of the International
Ladies' Garment Worker's Union sing about looking for the
union label.
   "All unions feel that if the public can see the real
people rather than the faceless group, then they'll be more
sympathetic," says Susan Cowell, vice president of the
garment workers' union, which spent $4.2 million running the
ad nationwide from 1975 to 1977.
   The biggest hurdle unions face in creating ad campaigns is
money. The garment workers' union has sharply cut down on its
chorus ads in recent years because of budget cuts.
   Still, Ms. Cowell says the pilots union is making the
right move. She adds: "People know who our members are now.
They're 45 years old and look like your mother; they don't
sing terribly well, and they don't dress terribly well."

   SQUARE D: Square D Co., Palatine, Ill., named Creswell,
Munsell, Fultz &amp; Zirbel, a Young &amp; Rubicam unit in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, to administer its estimated $30 million
world-wide account. Young &amp; Rubicam offices in Europe, Latin
America and the Far East will also work on the business.
Square D, a maker of electrical equipment, previously had its
ad assignments spread over nine agencies.
                                                                                                       

   CRUISE FINALISTS: Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Miami, said
it selected four finalists in the review of its $30
million-to-$35 million ad account: Geer, DuBois; Rosenfeld,
Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss; Martin Agency; and the
incumbent, Chiat/Day/Mojo. A decision is expected in early
October.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN EXPRESS: Retaliating against Visa's ad campaign
prompting merchants to persuade consumers to use only Visa
cards, American Express yesterday ran a newspaper ad
reminding merchants of the benefits of offering its card.
"When you consider the profits the American Express card
delivers to your business, you'll realize Visa's just
spinning their wheels," the ad said, making fun of a gimmicky
profit "wheel" Visa offered to merchants.
                                                                                                       

   GREEN AD: Marcal Paper Mills next month begins airing a TV
ad pitching its new paper towels made from 100% recycled
paper. The commercial, created by Berenter Greenhouse &amp;
Webster, plays on the strategies other paper-towel makers use
to win consumers, like lint-free claims, color variety or
sweepstakes offers. "If you care about the environment . . .
we've just made your decision a lot easier," the ad says.
"Think of what you can save."
