   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., saying Cummins
Engine Co.'s capital structure and debt protection have
improved because of a recent equity investment by three
friendly corporate holders, raised its ratings on the
company's $861 million in debt.
   Last month, Ford Motor Co., Tenneco Inc. and Japan's
Kubota Ltd. agreed to pay $250 million for a 27% aggregate
stake in the maker of diesel engines. Moody's said it thinks
the Columbus, Ind., concern's "planned use of the proceeds
from the equity infusion to pay down outstanding debt and to
redeem preferred stock will lead to a significant reduction
in the company's leverage and fixed charges." Moody's also
said it feels that the alliances with strategic investors
associated with the buying "offer good opportunities for
profitable new business."

   The rating concern said, however, that it "expects
Cummins's earnings and cash flow to remain under pressure
over the intermediate term," because of "soft industry
demand, persistent price discounting and the ongoing need to
invest large sums in capital improvement and product
development programs."
   Moody's raised its ratings on Cummins senior debentures to
Baa-3 from Ba-1, increased its subordinated debentures to Ba1
from Ba-3, and raised its rating on Cummins preferred stock
to "Ba-1" from "Ba-3."
