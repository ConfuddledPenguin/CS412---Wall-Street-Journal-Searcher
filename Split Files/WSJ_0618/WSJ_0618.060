   LOS ANGELES -- Federal prosecutors are seeking "a
substantial period of incarceration" for the president of a
now-defunct company that pleaded guilty in April to
falsifying test results on millions of nuts and bolts that
are supposed to hold together aircraft engines.
   The government's attempt to jail the executive, McHaffie
Inc.'s Norman McHaffie, is likely to be bolstered by a diary
account of the scheme kept by another defendant in the case.
Sentencing is set for today.

   In the hand-written journal, McHaffie quality-control
supervisor James Hicks detailed the extraordinary lengths to
which he, Mr. McHaffie and a third defendant, shop-floor
manager William Whitham, went to keep the skullduggery a
secret. All three men have admitted wrongdoing.
   The scam, the government says, took place over a 10-year
period beginning in 1979 and involved more than 4,000
government and commercial contracts. According to documents
filed in U.S. District Court here, the employees of Sylmar,
Calif.-based McHaffie decided not to conduct
Pentagon-mandated testing on their products, but rather
filled out blank, certified reports as if they had passed.
   The court papers also assert that certain bolts sent to
General Electric Co.'s engine-making division had actually
failed testing performed by an outside laboratory. But the
words "does not" were whited-out of the lab reports, which
were then photocopied, so that only "meet specification
requirements" remained.
   Eventually, the government says, Messrs. Hicks and
Whitham, with Mr. McHaffie's "knowledge and approval,
performed the dirty work of removing a large quantity of the
fraudulently created test documents from" the company's files
and threw them in a trash dumpster.
   Stephen Mansfield, the assistant U.S. attorney handling
the case, said no engine failures have been attributed to a
McHaffie part. But he painted the company's conduct as a
clear threat to safety. Among the planes using McHaffie
fasteners are the B-1 bomber, the A-7 attack plane and the
F-18, F-16 and F-14 fighters.
   In addition, thousands of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. commercial jets were outfitted with GE engines during
the time of the illicit conduct. GE, while maintaining there
was no danger, ultimately scrapped all the McHaffie equipment
it had in stock.
   The McHaffie case is part of a larger effort by the
Justice Department to crack down on companies that peddle
substandard or poorly tested aircraft components. Just a few
weeks ago, for instance, a unit of Banner Industries Inc.'s
Fairchild subsidiary agreed to plead guilty and pay $18
million in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal
charges stemming from fraudulent testing documents it
submitted on its aerospace fasteners.
   "It's clear that ferreting out quality fraud is a top
priority for the department," said Bruce Carter, an assistant
U.S. attorney in Seattle who is leading a special task force
focusing on such crimes.
   In the McHaffie case, the company faces a maximum fine of
$1.5 million, which the government is seeking. The
prosecution is also pushing for Mr. McHaffie to cough up
$750,000, the maximum, and he could land in prison for as
many as 15 years as well. Messrs. Hicks and Whitham, whom the
government says cooperated with the investigation once they
became fearful of being implicated, could be sentenced to up
to 10 years in prison and $500,000 fines.
   Lawyers for Messrs. McHaffie and Hicks declined comment.
Mr. Whitham's counsel couldn't be reached.
   The government said it anticipates that Mr. McHaffie may
try to blame the fraud on "renegade employees." But, it said,
that stance conflicts with his sworn plea and the evidence at
hand.
   In fact, Mr. Hicks may have begun to keep his diary of
deceit after becoming worried that Mr. McHaffie would try to
pin the whole affair on him. At one point, he chronicled
efforts by a GE official, John Frassica, to get to the bottom
of what was happening.
   "John Frassica called and said he could not figure out why
their test failed and ours passed," Mr. Hicks wrote in a
March 28, 1989, entry.
   Then on March 31: "He called twice wanting answers. I told
Norm {Mr. McHaffie} there was no way to explain."
   April 4: "Norm's idea was for me to take the blame for
everything to protect the rest. I agreed and he said that if
I took the blame he would set up another business if
necessary and continue to pay me as normal. Everyone in the
meeting agreed with the plan. Norm committed that he would
see that all of us would be taken care of and shook hands."
   In a filing last week, the government contended that
McHaffie, which shut down operations in June 1989 and
eventually sold off its assets, saved more than $1.5 million
by its actions. The government also contended that Mr.
McHaffie's "10-year fraud . . . has enabled him to live a
comfortable life," citing his ownership of a $250,000-plus
yacht and several condominiums in Mexico.
   In one of his last diary entries on June 2, Mr. Hicks
wrote: "The people in the plant are very nervous about their
jobs. I'm doing the best I can to answer questions, but I
don't know much about what's going on. All Norm has said is
it's every man for himself."
   Mr. Hicks then penned two final words: "Nice guy."
