   Allegheny International Inc. said in Pittsburgh that its
Sunbeam Corp. (Canada) Ltd. unit will end manufacturing in
Canada, eliminating 200 jobs, some of them seasonal.
   Sunbeam will close its Solaray facility at Brantford,
Ontario, by mid-December, ending production of electric and
non-electric blankets, heating pads and humidification
products. Sales, marketing and other administrative functions
currently performed at Brantford will be consolidated with
Sunbeam's Toronto operation.

   In addition, Sunbeam will end production of gas barbecue
grills and lawnmowers at its Toronto facility, effective
immediately.
   Sunbeam said it will continue to sell a full line of
products in Canada, most of them manufactured in the
company's U.S. plants. Sunbeam Canada will employ about 160
people after the cutbacks.
   Allegheny is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
