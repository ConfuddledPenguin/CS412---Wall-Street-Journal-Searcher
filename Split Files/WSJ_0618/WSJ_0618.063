   AMSTERDAM -- The Dutch consumer price index was unchanged
in the month ending in mid-May, but up 2.2% from the
year-earlier period, the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics
said.
   It was the fourth month in a row that inflation showed a
rise of 2.2% over the year-earlier month. In January, the
price rise was 2.1% from a year earlier.
