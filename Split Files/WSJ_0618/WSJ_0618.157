   A principal law firm of American Continental Corp. and its
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association unit agreed to pay $20
million to settle suits filed by stockholders and bondholders
of the defunct thrift.
   In a statement released Friday, the New York law firm of
Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler said the settlement
represents less than two percent of the maximum total
recovery sought by the plaintiffs and is covered by the
firm's insurance policies.

   The law firm was an adviser to the thrift and Charles H.
Keating Jr., the former head of Lincoln and chairman of
American Continental.
   Almost 22,000 small investors purchased American
Continental bonds at the thrift's California branches. The
investors say they lost approximately $300 million when
American Continental collapsed and began operating under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1989. The
Lincoln Savings unit was seized by thrift regulators the same
month.
   The settlement covers all class action suits filed in
federal and California state courts. The allegations included
racketeering charges. The investors claimed they were
defrauded as a result of false financial statements made by
the thrift. The investors sought to recoup their losses from
Kaye Scholer and more than 60 other defendants, who they
allege bore some responsibility for the thrift's actions.
   "We are convinced that we committed no wrongdoing and are
not liable to anyone for the losses that have occurred," the
firm's statement said. The firm said it settled to avoid
protracted and costly litigation.
   Leonard Simon of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie &amp; Lerach,
a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the settlement represents a
"reasonable payment" by the law firm.
   One other defendant in the case has settled. In March, the
Los Angeles law firm of Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp;
Samuelian provisionally agreed to a settlement in which it
denied any wrongdoing. The arrangement calls for payment of
$4.3 million to the plaintiffs by the law firm's insurance
carriers and another $10 million in payments if that amount
isn't recouped from other defendants.

   REDLINING ALLEGATIONS against Fannie Mae are being
investigated.
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating allegations
that the Federal National Mortgage Association has been
discriminating against lenders who want to finance
development projects in predominately black sections of St.
Louis.
   Prosecutors with the department's civil rights division
wrote Fannie Mae last month seeking records for all the
mortgages that it bought for multifamily developments in St.
Louis, and seven surrounding counties since 1985, according
to a copy of the letter.
   The agency responded with a list of 37 developments. None
involved conventional financing for projects in the St. Louis
area's predominately black neighborhoods.
   Fannie Mae is a federally chartered, publicly traded
company that operates a secondary market in mortgage loans.
It buys mortgages from lenders and packages some into
securities for sale to investors. The agency buys
approximately one in eight mortgage loans nationwide and
recently has been touting its commitment to help low-income,
moderate-income and middle-income Americans buy homes.
   A spokesman for Fannie Mae said it is cooperating with the
investigation and said it does not discriminate in any way. A
spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
   The allegations first came to light in April, when St.
Louis developer Bruce Ring filed a suit in federal court
alleging that Fannie Mae and First Interstate Mortgage Co. of
Illinois, a local lender in St. Louis, were redlining in the
city's depressed northern section. Redlining is the practice
by which lenders reject loan applications in poor
neighborhoods. Mr. Ring's suit, the first in the country to
accuse Fannie Mae of redlining, is pending in U.S. District
Court in St. Louis.
   Mr. Ring claimed he applied to Fannie Mae through First
Interstate last August to refinance $3.6 million in
short-term loans so he could renovate seven run-down
apartment buildings in St. Louis. Five of the properties were
in North St. Louis. According to the suit, Fannie Mae turned
down the entire application after a First Interstate vice
president inspected the five sites and described them as
being in risky locations.
   The Justice Department has also written First Interstate
requesting "statistical data" on the mortgage company's
lending practices in St. Louis and surrounding counties.
Samuel C. Ebling, First Interstate's attorney, said he did
not comply.
   A spokesman for Fannie Mae said the company "does not
approve of or condone redlining and we carry out our business
in a way that reflects that."

   PAINT COMPANY SUES INSURERS for refusing to settle
products-liability suit.
   Cook Paint &amp; Varnish Co. is facing a $20 million jury
verdict that it says could have been avoided if its carriers
hadn't resisted negotiating a settlement. Conflicts over who
should pay such awards have long existed between an insured
defendant and its carriers, but recently suits alleging
damages for failure to settle have increased.
   "It's kind of a new trend in litigation," says Robert
Adams, an attorney in the Houston firm of Dunn, Kacal, Adams,
Pappas &amp; Law, counsel for St. Louis-based Safety Mutual
Casualty Corp., one of 10 insurance carriers named in the
case. The suit seeks $70 million in damages, including $50
million in punitive damages.
   Cook, a North Kansas City, Mo., paint manufacturer, was
held liable in a case brought by Allied Tank Services Inc., a
San Antonio, Texas, maker of drinking-water tanks. Allied
said it used Cook's paints to coat the interior of some of
its water tanks, but it alleged that the paint cracked and
bubbled, contaminating the water. Last week, a state court
jury in San Antonio found Cook negligent and awarded Allied
$20 million in damages.
   Thomas W. Wagstaff, an attorney with the Kansas City firm
of Blackwell Sanders Matheny Weary &amp; Lombardi, counsel for
Cook, said the Texas trial judge will be asked to set the
verdict aside. But in the meantime, he has sued the 10
carriers in state court in Liberty, Mo., alleging that they
acted in "bad faith." The suit says Cook demanded several
times that the carriers settle the Allied suit, but
defendants refused "even though the consequences . . . could
be devastating to Cook."
   Before trial, Mr. Wagstaff says, attorneys for Allied had
offered to settle their claims for $6.5 million, a figure he
contends could have been negotiated down to between $2
million and $3 million.
   Mr. Adams says many of the carriers weren't notified about
the Allied suit until it was being tried. They had
insufficient time to evaluate the extent of liability
coverage, whether the trial was being properly handled, or
whether it should be settled, he said.
   Also named as defendants are Missouri Insurance Guaranty
Association, St. Louis; Transport Indemnity Co., Los Angeles;
Fremont Indemnity Co., Los Angeles; International Insurance
Co., Chicago; Columbia Casualty Co., Chicago; International
Surplus Lines Insurance Co., Chicago; Constitution State
Insurance Co., Hartford; Granite State Insurance Co.,
Manchester, N.H.; and Union Insurance Co., Lincoln, Neb. They
either couldn't be reached or declined comment.
   Attorneys for Allied couldn't be reached for comment.

   A FORMER WEATHER UNDERGROUND radical is helping plan the
ABA's annual meeting.
   Bernardine Dohrn, who won notoriety two decades ago as a
revolutionary leader advocating "armed struggle" against the
U.S. government, will serve as program vice chair for the
American Bar Association's litigation section activities at
the August meeting, to be held in Chicago.
   Ms. Dohrn has been assisting the litigation section
program chairman for nearly a year in organizing panel
discussions and speeches. Topics to be discussed will range
from "The Ethical Example of Sir Thomas More" to "Using
Experts Cost-Effectively in Corporate Litigation."
   Ms. Dohrn spent the 1970s as a fugitive from
law-enforcement authorities. Soon after surfacing in 1980,
she was convicted of misdemeanor assault charges associated
with the 1969 "days of rage" demonstrations in Chicago. She
received a fine and was placed on probation. Ms. Dohrn worked
briefly at the New York office of Sidley &amp; Austin, but moved
to Chicago after her admission to the New York bar was held
up by its character committee. She is currently working in
Cook County's Office of the Public Guardian.
   Litigation program chairwoman Patricia Lee Refo said she
found Ms. Dohrn to be "a very capable person" and "a big help
in putting together the programs."

   THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS hired a law firm on a
contingency fee basis.
   Usually the state pays its outside lawyers on an hourly
basis. However, in a contingency arrangement, five attorneys
from the Boston law firm of Dangel &amp; de Benedictis, will act
as special assistant attorneys general in an asbestos case.
They are representing the state in a suit to recover the
costs of repairing asbestos-contaminated, state-owned
buildings. The defendants are asbestos manufacturers and
distributors. The firm will be paid on a sliding scale of no
more than 30% of the potential recovery, which has been
estimated at more than $100 million, according to a spokesman
for the state attorney general's office.
   The contingency fee arrangement is expected to be cheaper
for the state than hourly payments because if it looses, it
will not pay fees, and will incur no more than $2.5 million
for expenses.
