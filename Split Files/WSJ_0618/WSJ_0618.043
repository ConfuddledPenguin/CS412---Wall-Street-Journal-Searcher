   I want to correct a misquote in the May 23 "Heard on the
Street" column regarding Playboy's new recapitalization plan.
For the record, the recapitalization plan does not dilute the
voting power of any shareholder nor change control. It does
provide the company with additional flexibility to use equity
in future acquisitions, financings and employee-benefit
plans, which will benefit all shareholders.
   In my comments regarding the plan and voting rights of
stockholders, the reporter quoted me as saying, "I'm sort of
a believer in one share, one vote," which would be strange
and illogical on the eve of creating a nonvoting class of
stock. What I said was, "I'm a believer in one voting share,
one vote." Anyone who holds voting stock has a right and
responsibility to exercise his vote. This right has been
preserved under Playboy's recapitalization plan, and that is
why we did not disenfranchise the majority shareholder, as
most companies have, in his right to vote on this plan.
</LP>
