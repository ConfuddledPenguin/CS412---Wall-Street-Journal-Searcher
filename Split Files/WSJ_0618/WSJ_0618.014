   LONDON -- Britain's annual rate of inflation rose more
than expected to 9.7% in May from 9.4% in April.
   The so-called underlying rate, which by excluding
mortgage-interest payments and the recently introduced
"community charge" is more comparable with European inflation
measures, rose to 7% from 6.5%.

   A Treasury spokeswoman said the inflation rise, which was
caused by increased food and clothing prices and the residual
impact of higher excise duties on tobacco and alcohol prices,
is "not very welcome."
   Economists warned that the rise in the underlying level
indicates that inflationary pressures are even more
entrenched than expected, and that will make it even more
difficult for the government to achieve the economic
conditions it has set for taking the British pound into the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The government has repeatedly said that it won't take that
step until British inflation is down closer to European
levels. Although it remains unclear exactly what inflation
measure the government will use in making its judgment,
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major has said that an
underlying level will be used.
   Stephen Hannah, head of research at Natwest Capital
Markets, predicted that the underlying inflation rate won't
fall toward European inflation levels until early next year.
"If we take the government at its word," sterling probably
won't be able to join the exchange rate mechanism until the
spring, he said.
   Sterling rose sharply last week on speculation that the
government is considering taking sterling into the mechanism
as early as this autumn, but it slipped back after the
inflation report was released.
   The rise in the annual rate of inflation, as measured by
the retail price index, was higher than the 9.5% average of
economists' forecasts and took the rate back up to its
highest level since March 1982, when it was at 10.4%.
   The 0.5-point increase in the underlying rate took it to
its highest level since October 1982, when it was also at 7%.
   Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co.,
said price rises in clothing and food confirm that the
country is facing continued demand-led inflation. Retail
sales figures last week indicated that consumer spending
remains buoyant despite the government's tight-money policy.
