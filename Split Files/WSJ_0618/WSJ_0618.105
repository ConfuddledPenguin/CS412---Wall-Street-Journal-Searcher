   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
to $6.94 billion in April, primarily because a sharp drop in
imports offset a smaller decline in exports, the Commerce
Department reported.
   April's deficit, which compared with an $8.36 billion gap
in March, reflected a 6.2% plunge in imports to $39.25
billion. Exports fell 3.5% to $32.31 billion.

   Generally, economists said slow economic growth in the
U.S. pulled imports down in April, and they suggested the
drop in exports may have reflected a slight sag in economies
abroad.
   "This drop in imports is a reflection of the slowdown of
the general {U.S.} economy that has generated less demand,"
said Richard Rippe, chief economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York. "Now looking at exports . . . this kind of
bouncing around from month to month is not all that unusual;
it might reflect a little slowing down in overseas economies,
but there isn't enough data to substantiate that yet."
   Most economists were reluctant to read much into the
single month's trade numbers. Despite April's fall in
exports, many said they found the overall trend encouraging.
The economies of most major U.S. trading partners are still
quite strong, economists said, suggesting that demand for
U.S. products will continue to be vigorous for some time.
   "Exports are going to enjoy a certain amount of growth
over the next few months, due to demand abroad, particularly
in Western Europe," said Fred Sturm, senior economist for
Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Overall, economists say they expect the trade deficit to
continue to narrow in coming months. "We are seeing a lower
deficit already . . . and I think we will end this year with
a substantially improved merchandise-trade deficit," said
Kermit Baker, chief economist for Cahners Economics in
Massachusetts.
   Declines in imports were widespread in April. Imports of
cars, clothing, office machinery and general industrial
machinery all fell. Oil imports also dropped, reflecting a
fall in oil prices. But the volume of oil imports shrank as
well, to 226 million barrels from 261 million barrels in
March.
   Exports of aircraft and chemicals increased. But many
other categories showed declines, including office machinery,
power generating machinery, electrical machinery, cars and
general industrial machinery.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, consistently the
largest the U.S. has with any country, widened to $4 billion
from $3.62 billion in March. But the U.S. trade surplus with
Western Europe also continued to swell, nearly doubling in
April to $1.36 billion.
   All the numbers except the trade balances with individual
countries are adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations.
