   Among Far East nations, the outlook for corporate-earnings
growth improved in Hong Kong and Malaysia during May but
continued to deteriorate in Japan, according to the latest
survey of analysts by Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
   According to the survey, earnings prospects were
little-changed in Australia, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand
and South Korea. Because of insufficient data, IBES doesn't
generate estimates for Taiwan, the Philippines or Indonesia.
   IBES, a unit of the New York-based securities house Lynch
Jones &amp; Ryan, tabulates thousands of analysts' reports each
month to produce "consensus" earnings estimates for
individual stocks and markets throughout the world. The
consensus estimates always look 12 months into the future and
are derived by combining per-share earnings estimates for
each company's current fiscal year with estimates for its
next fiscal year.
   In the case of Japan, overall estimated earnings growth
fell to 5% from 8% last month, the lowest level since IBES
began tracking Japanese shares in February 1989. Although
analysts expected earnings in most market sectors to increase
at least 5% in the next 12 months, they predicted that
earnings growth will decline in three sectors: utilities,
financial services and energy-related companies.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN INFLATION
                                                                                                       

   A South Korean government think tank predicted the
nation's consumer prices would rise 12% to 13% this year,
about twice the government's original projection of 5% to 7%.
The Korea Development Institute said the 1990 inflation rate
would be the largest rise since 1981, when consumer prices
surged 21% on a year-on-year basis. The institute noted that
unless the high inflationary pressures are curbed, workers,
who had agreed to relatively low wage increases this year,
will demand high wage raises next year.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS BAN BRITISH BEEF
                                                                                                       

   Switzerland banned imports of British cattle and beef as a
precaution against "mad cow" disease, the nerve disorder that
has killed 13,000 cows in Britain over the past four years.
Last week, France, Germany and Italy lifted bans on British
beef imports after a compromise devised by the 12-nation
European Community, of which Switzerland isn't a member.
Under the compromise, EC farm ministers agreed to limit
British exports of live cattle to calves under six months of
age, and to certify that beef exports were from herds where
no traces of the disease were found in the past two years.
                                                                                                       

   MALAYSIA AIRLINES BONUS
                                                                                                       

   The 16,000 employees of Malaysia Airlines will get a bonus
of three months' pay because of increased profit in the
fiscal year ended last March 31, said Managing Director Abdul
Aziz Abdul Rahman. He said the airlines' financial accounts
were still being audited but that net profit for the last
fiscal year was estimated at 180 million ringgit ($66.4
million); the previous year's net profit was 154 million
ringgit, and two months' bonus was paid to the staff.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS IN THE PHILIPPINES
                                                                                                       

   AIDS is spreading at double its previous rate in the
Philippines, the government said. It said there were four
cases a month in 1990, compared with two a month last year.
Manuel Dayrit, government health director for AIDS control,
said the nation had a total of 172 AIDS-related cases on
record, of which 31 had the disease and 141 were infected
with the HIV virus. Twenty people had died of AIDS thus far,
he said. Mr. Dayrit said female prostitutes were the largest
group of those infected, totaling 93 cases.
                                                                                                       

   ANGER IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's Vice Economics Minister Chiang Pin-kung told
Taiwanese and Japanese industrialists that Japan "was sick
with fear of the rabid Chinese Communists" and treated Taiwan
with less respect than the smallest African country. Taiwan
had a record trade deficit of $6.96 billion with Japan in
1989. Mr. Chiang said Japan wouldn't address the trade issue
because it feared offending Beijing.
                                                                                                       

   RESTITUTION FROM EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East Germany agreed to return property and other assets
that its governments since 1949 have confiscated from
citizens and refugees, West German government officials said.
   Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said such property owners also can apply for financial
compensation for damages.
   The agreement came about as part of the economic and
monetary unification of the two Germanys set for July 1. It
doesn't cover property confiscated during the 1945-1949
Soviet administration of the territory that later became East
Germany. The Soviets and East Germans balked at that idea,
Mr. Seiters said.
   The pact does state that should a single parliament be
formed to govern both Germanys, the question of compensation
or return of assets seized between 1945 and 1949 would be
readdressed.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   In Australia, the Sydney Opera House will hand out 20,000
free throat lozenges over the next two months in an attempt
to achieve a coughless concert. . . . French couturier
Christian Lacroix will launch a ready-to-wear collection for
men in 1992. "I want to create for men all the things I can
never find myself," including red trousers, he told a French
newspaper.
