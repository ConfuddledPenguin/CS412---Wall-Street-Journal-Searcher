   CHICAGO -- William Farley's troubles with red ink may be
spilling over into his dealings with printer's ink.
   R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. has sued the investor for $2.5
million in unpaid bills arising from his troubled takeover of
West Point-Pepperell Inc. The Chicago-based printing concern
says Mr. Farley hasn't paid for the massive amount of
financial printing he ran up during his protracted $1.56
billion tender offer for the West Point, Ga.-based textile
company.

   Mr. Farley has been unable to complete the purchase of the
5% of West Point-Pepperell shares he doesn't own and is said
to be considering offers for his majority stake from other
investors in order to raise cash.
   Mr. Farley's difficulties have mounted in the wake of the
collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., earlier this year. His closely held Farley Inc. had a
pretax loss of about $40 million in 1989, analysts estimated.
   Farley spokesmen couldn't be reached for comment.
