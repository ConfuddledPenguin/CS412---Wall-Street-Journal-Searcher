   The workaholic generation is working to put its family
life back on track.
   After a decade of career obsession, more professionals and
managers are balking at grueling hours, frequent travel and
family neglect. There's a push for equilibrium between work
and home, even at a cost of lost promotions and pay.

   And that means pressing often reluctant companies for more
work schedule options. Last week, the Senate approved
legislation already passed by the House that would require
companies to give workers up to 12 weeks annual unpaid leave
for childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses. But
President Bush has threatened to veto it, saying such
benefits should be offered voluntarily. Business groups
likewise oppose the measure and say many companies already
offer such benefits.
   Even if it survives to become a law, the legislation
covers only special circumstances, and many employees say
day-to-day problems need addressing, too. To achieve balance,
some are negotiating part-time jobs or switching to
slower-paced careers. Others are staying in full-time jobs
but limiting business travel and their daily schedules.
   "Unless I'm inventing a cure for AIDS, unless I'm really
making a major social contribution, it's not worth missing my
daughter growing up," says Judy Pesin, 38 years old, who once
worked 12-hour days as a vice president of Citicorp but
switched to part-time work there after the birth of her child
four years ago. "I'm good at what I do, but delivering $50
million in banker's acceptances isn't worth the tradeoff."
   For the most part, it's women who are leading the push for
flexible work schedules, and getting them at a small but
growing number of companies. The drive is especially evident
for baby boomer women in their 30s and early 40s who've had
fewer and later-born children, and now want to invest as much
energy in their progeny as their deals.
   Consider Joan Cohlan, 35, who after her son was born
continued to work a frenetic pace as a marketing executive at
Citicorp. When she wasn't at the office, she was out-of-town
on business or grappling with a 90-minute commute. "The
challenge was to be like a man," she says. "But I missed the
first three years of my son's life." So she quit to do
consulting work from her home, and to learn she was "capable
of being a good mother."
   When her son was five, Ms. Cohlan took a full-time
management job at Nynex Corp. nearer to her home in White
Plains, N.Y., and tries to limit her daily work schedule to
10 hours. She believes she has the best of both worlds now --
a professional challenge coupled with family support. She
earns less than she did at Citicorp, so she and her husband
have shelved home-renovation plans, deferred vacations and
frequent dinners out. But she's gained "a sense of family."
   Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a research firm, noted a
similar shift in its annual surveys of American values and
life style. "We're finding that having it all and doing it
all is neither desirable nor practical," says Barbara Caplan,
the vice president of the firm. Both women and men are
beginning to "reassess" tradeoffs between work and family,
she says.
   Many women are still deeply committed to work, but "the
issue here is options," Ms. Caplan says. And "while men don't
want to be Mr. Moms, they're rethinking how much of their
family lives, friends and leisure they're willing to give
up."
   In fact, more than half of 500 men polled recently by
Robert Half International, the executive recruiting firm,
said they'd be willing to cut their salaries as much as 25%
to have more family or personal time; about 45% said they'd
likely turn down a promotion if it meant spending less time
with their families.
   Paul Whitehead, a 39-year-old attorney at the United
Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, has strong memories of
"hearing the back door shut in our house every day at 4:52
p.m., hearing my dad walk into the front hall and kiss my mom
hello. I associate my happy childhood with a father who was
home." Mr. Whitehead used to routinely put in 70 hours a week
at work. But since he married and subsequently had a son
three years ago, he's learned to do more in fewer hours, so
there's time left over for family.
   Not all bosses or colleagues understand, however.
Switching to the balanced track is a risky proposition that
almost always includes a price -- a cut in pay perhaps or
loss of a promotion. Sometimes it's a decline in career
status, or respect. "If you acknowledge that you like to
spend a lot of time with your family, you risk being seen as
not sufficiently dedicated to your job," says David
Machlowitz, who left a New York law firm three years ago for
a less-frenetic corporate counsel's job.
   He still works long days and travels out-of-town on
business, but he has "more control over scheduling," he says.
Nevertheless, after talking openly about his career switch, a
co-worker in another department sent his boss a snide note
saying, "Gee, can I get a job in your department?"
   Mr. Machlowitz warns those who want more time outside work
to "make sure you'll be judged on the basis of what you
accomplish rather than the mere hours you spend in the
office, even if you spend them talking about football or
office gossip."
   Indeed, many companies still equate high performance with
physical presence at work, rather than contributions, leaving
employees with responsibilities for children or elderly
relatives at a "distinct disadvantage," says Fran Rodgers,
president of Work/Family Directions, a Watertown, Mass.,
consulting firm.
   Linda Ortwein, a principal at Kurt Salwyn Associates, a
New York management consulting company, has squeezed her
weekly work load into a four-day, 40-hour schedule since her
daughter turned one. While her productivity hasn't slipped,
she believes that "in the short term I may not have the same
opportunities to advance." And although she often works at
home in the evenings, she worries about whether her staff
feels resentful when she leaves the office each day at 6 p.m.
   Slowing down in times of managerial and cost cutbacks can
be chancy, too. Says one Wall Street skeptic: "If your firm
is going through a 20% cutback, do you want to be the first
one to say you want part-time work?"
   Most corporations are only beginning to come to grips with
tensions in the modern work force, where more than half of
women return to their jobs within a year of having a child
and 60% of employed men have employed wives. Yet the
high-cost of replacing experienced employees and other
economic factors are propelling companies to offer more
family-supportive policies. A survey of 259 major employers
by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, shows that
55% offer some form of child-care aid, 31% provide elder-care
aid, 56% have flexible scheduling, 42% offer unpaid parental
leave and 14% provide adoption benefits.
   "Companies are being pressured to accommodate more -- but
they're reacting with schizophrenic sensitivity," says
Kathleen Christensen, a City University of New York professor
who surveyed flexible scheduling at 521 U.S. corporations.
"They say sure you can work at home as long as you do 80
hours a week, or they give one person part time, but don't
reduce that person's work load."
   And even compressed work schedules don't leave very much
time for families. Gloria Jacobs works four days a week as a
senior editor at New York Woman magazine. But on those four
days, she says, "I come home beat to kids who are also tired.
There's really no life with them during the week." She also
worries she may not be there for guidance. "There's a lot
going on at school -- racial tensions, boy-girl issues -- and
{my eight-year-old daughter} wants to talk about it when she
gets out for the day, not at 7:30 at night."
   Others believe some jobs simply can't be done on
flex-time. Marlee Myers, a partner at Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart
in Pittsburgh, says she's had to accept that her corporate
practice can't fit into a part-time or even normal full-time
work schedule. "You don't know if you'll be working until 10
p.m. or 2 a.m. or around the clock -- but you have to do
whatever it takes to get the deal done."
   She's able to do that, she acknowledges, because her
husband, a free-lance writer, can always be home for dinner
with their two children, ages seven and 10. Ms. Myers is also
"skeptical" about what critics deride as "the mommy track,"
and wonders if part-timers can really get ahead. "You can be
a part-time lawyer and not do the kind of work I do, but to
me it's not the most challenging work. You have to make a
choice, and there's a price you pay."
   That ability to make a choice is the point for many, and
it looks as if it may become available to more employees as
time goes on. Peter Friedes, chief executive of Hewitt
Associates, the benefits consulting firm, believes that over
the next 20 years a "normal career" will be replaced by
"multiple paths that people will take trying to be good
workers and good parents." Companies will operate like ski
resorts, he believes, with multiple starting points, paths
and ending points at the bottom of the mountain. "Even the
idea of stopping half way down the mountain for lunch seems
applicable to a career," he says.
   Laura Meyer, a 39-year-old Citicorp manager, felt her own
half-way stop was an enjoyable pause in a demanding career.
After her second child was born two years ago, she took a
one-year leave from her job as director of investor relations
to spend more time with her family. And because she'd left
her job "in a senior capacity with good exposure," returning
to another senior position was no problem.
   Similarly Susan Reid Morris, a 35-year-old Washington,
D.C., attorney who switched from full-time to a part-time
position after the birth of her daughter, says her path has
already produced a payoff for her daughter's future. "When
she's asked what she wants to do when she grows up, she says
she wants to be a lawyer and a mommy. In her mind, she's sure
it can work out."
