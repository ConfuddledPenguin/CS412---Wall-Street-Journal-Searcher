   TOKYO -- Japan said it will commit 420 trillion to 450
trillion yen ($2.72 trillion to $2.92 trillion) to public
works spending over the next 10 years in response to U.S.
calls that it spend more on roads, parks, and other social
infrastructure programs.
   Japan, however, will reject a U.S. request to specify the
size of public works spending as a percentage of gross
national product, government sources said. The figure of 450
trillion yen could be roughly 8% of Japan's GNP, they said.
The plan doesn't include works of the JR Group of railway
companies and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.

   Japan's 10-year public works plan will put emphasis on
programs aimed at raising living standards and protecting the
environment, the sources said. Japan will reveal the plan
during the fifth round of bilateral structural impediments
initiative talks set for June 25-26 in Tokyo.
