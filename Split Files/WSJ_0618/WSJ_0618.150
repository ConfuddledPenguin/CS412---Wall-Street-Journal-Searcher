   Micron Technology Inc., continuing to suffer from
cutthroat competition in the semiconductor industry, reported
net income for its fiscal third quarter plunged 93% to $1.8
million, or five cents a share.
   Micron's third consecutive quarterly decline in profit
came as revenue slipped 29% to $84.1 million from $119.2
million. In the year-earlier quarter, Micron earned $28.8
million, or 75 cents a share.

   For the nine months ended May 31, profit plummeted 98% to
$1.9 million, or five cents a share, from $90.1 million, or
$2.37 a share, a year earlier. Revenue tumbled 34% to $228
million from $343.4 million.
   Micron said the earnings declines reflect the effects of
"downward price pressure on the company's principal
products," as well as a slow and costly updating of its
product line to include the so-called one megabit dynamic
random access memory chips, or DRAMs.
