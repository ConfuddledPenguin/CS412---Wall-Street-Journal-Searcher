   Manpower PLC said that pretax profit for the six months to
April 30 declined 14%, principally because of lower profit in
its non-Manpower brand operations, which were sold June 4.
   The London-based company, an employment and financial
services group, said it isn't declaring an interim dividend
because of insufficient distributable reserves. Last year, it
declared an interim dividend of 0.6 penny a share.

   Pretax profit for the six-month period was #21.3 million
($36.4 million), down 14% from year-earlier profit of #24.8
million. Profit after tax was #12.7 million vs. # 15.6
million a year earlier. Per-share earnings eased 18% to 1.8
pennies a share from 2.2 pennies.
   Analysts said the results were slightly worse than
expected, with the average forecast for around #23.5 million
pretax profit.
   Manpower's share price rose 1 penny to 88 pennies on the
results, before easing to 87 1/2 around midday Friday on the
London Stock Exchange.
