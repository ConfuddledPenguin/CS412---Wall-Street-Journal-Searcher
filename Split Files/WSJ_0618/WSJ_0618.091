   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration reversed its policy
and announced it will support a special international fund to
wean developing countries from chemicals that destroy the
Earth's protective ozone layer.
   The change of course removes a stumbling block from an
international conference in London next week that is expected
to accelerate the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, which are damaging the upper-atmosphere ozone layer
that filters the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

   Developing countries, including such giants as India and
China, have insisted they need financial and technological
help, and the industrialized countries expect them to join in
switching to chemicals that are safer for the atmosphere.
   The White House drew strong criticism at home and abroad
last month, when the U.S. objected to an international
proposal to create a fund of at least $100 million. Chief of
Staff John Sununu objected to setting the precedent of a
special environmental fund and insisted aid should be
provided through existing organizations. But
environmentalists and industry and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher appealed to the White House to change its
position.
   A statement issued by Mr. Sununu on the new policy
stipulates the U.S. will support the new fund, and would
donate about $25 million to it over three years, on the
condition that this doesn't set a precedent for further
foreign aid for environmental causes.
