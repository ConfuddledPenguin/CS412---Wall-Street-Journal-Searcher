   TORONTO -- Gordon Capital Corp. said the Ontario
Securities Commission postponed a 10-day ban on principal
trading by Gordon, pending the brokerage concern's appeal of
the ban.
   The ban was imposed because of a regulatory violation that
Gordon says was inadvertent. Principal trading involves
trading shares for a securities dealer's own account.

   The ban was to have taken effect July 18. Gordon said no
hearing date has been set for its appeal.
