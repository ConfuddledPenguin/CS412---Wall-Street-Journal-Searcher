   MADRID -- Repsol S.A., the Spanish state-controlled oil
company, and La Caixa, Spain's largest savings bank, are
understood to be at an advanced stage in negotiations for the
creation of a giant Spanish gas utility.
   The principal remaining question, however, is understood
to be who will be Repsol's partner in the utility: Repsol
wants La Caixa itself as a partner, while the savings bank
would prefer to participate indirectly through water utility
Aguas de Barcelona S.A., of which it is a shareholder.

   At stake are Spanish government efforts to reorganize
Spain's fragmented gas industry and keep it under Spanish
control. Repsol officials say their aim is to create a single
large gas utility along the lines of British Gas, Gaz de
France or Belgium's Distrigas.
   Repsol's parent, the state oil and gas agency Instituto
Nacional de Hidrocarburos, is investing heavily through
Repsol's sister company, Enagas, in a project to bring
natural gas by pipeline to Spain from Norway.
   In parallel, Repsol began talks last year aimed at
regrouping its gas activities with those of Spain's biggest
gas utility, Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas S.A.
   But alarm bells rang a few months ago when the U.K.'s
British Gas disclosed it had bought around 8% of Catalana de
Gas.
   The prospect of foreign companies getting an inexpensive
back door into Spain's gas market added impetus to Repsol's
efforts to forge a unified national gas utility.
   To strengthen Repsol's hand, INH launched a bid last month
for control of Gas Madrid, Spain's second largest gas
utility. As a result of this bid, INH now controls 87% of
Enagas, directly and through Repsol.
   The plans under discussion between Repsol and La Caixa
call for the creation of a joint holding company owning
Repsol's holdings in Gas Madrid and a number of regional gas
utilities. The regional interests would include a sizable
stake in Catalana de Gas, which in turn has stakes in gas
firms in Andalusia and Valencia. Repsol owns 11.8% of
Catalana de Gas, and La Caixa owns 24%. Another
Barcelona-based savings bank, Caja de Barcelona, which is
planning to merge with La Caixa, owns 10% of Catalana de Gas.
   But a spokeswoman for La Caixa said the talks, though at
an advanced stage, appear for the moment to have reached a
dead end.
   The reason, she said, was the government's insistence that
La Caixa be Repsol's direct partner in the gas venture.
