   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. said
exports declined significantly in May from a year earlier,
although domestic sales and production rose.
   Officials of both companies attributed the continued drop
in exports to efforts to shift production overseas.

   Exports by Toyota, Japan's largest auto manufacturer, fell
3.6% in May to 147,377 units, the second consecutive monthly
decline. A company official cited a downward trend in exports
to North America.
   Toyota exports to the U.S. and Canada in May fell 11.6% to
68,319 units from a year earlier. Conversely, exports to the
Middle East rose 9.4% to 9,625 units, reflecting the region's
improving economy. Passenger car exports to the Middle East
jumped 12.5%, while exports to Europe rose 5.5%.
   Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, reported similar
results. It said exports in May fell for the ninth
consecutive month, declining 6% to 79,049 units.
   Exports to Southeast Asia tumbled 29.7% to 6,399 units, a
Nissan official said, while exports to Europe fell 16.5% to
32,592 units.
   Nissan's exports to the U.S. climbed 15% to 25,333 units,
but the company official said the rise was exaggerated. "The
volume remains consistent but the basis of comparison was
particularly low," she said.
   Toyota's domestic sales rose 8.4% from last May to
194,203, marking the 14th consecutive monthly increase. It
said the total represented a new high for the month, topping
the previous record of 179,165 units set in 1989.
   Total domestic market share held by Toyota slipped one
percentage point to 32%.
   Sales of Toyota's passenger cars rose 5.8% to 144,479
units, while sales of trucks and buses rose 16.6% to 49,724
units.
   Nissan's domestic sales grew 5.6% in May to 103,424,
putting its domestic market share for May at 23.3%, down 0.1
percentage point from May 1989.
   Nissan's sales of passenger cars rose 4.2% to 77,145
units, a record for the month. Truck and bus sales rose 9.9%
to 26,279 units.
   Toyota's overall production rose 9.1% to 357,503 units
last month, a record for the month of May. Overseas
production soared 58.7% to to 60,447 units. A breakdown of
output showed an 11.7% increase in passenger cars, to
284,173, while trucks and buses slipped 0.1% to 73,330 units.
   Nissan's overall production rose 6.5% to 252,173 units
last month, with domestic output rising 10.7% to 196,666
units.
   Overseas production by Nissan fell from a year earlier for
the second consecutive month, an indication that Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. (U.S.) and Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(U.K.) Ltd. are set to release new models, the company said.
   Nissan produced 161,162 passenger cars in May, up 10.6%,
and 35,504 trucks and buses, up 11.3%.
