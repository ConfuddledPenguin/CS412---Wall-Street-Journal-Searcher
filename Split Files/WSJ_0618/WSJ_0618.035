   MADRID -- The Koplowitz sisters get the construction
companies. Los Albertos get the finance firms.
   That, roughly, is the result of a settlement affecting one
of Spain's biggest private business empires, Construcciones y
Contratas S.A.

   In a pact ending months of wrangling, principal owners
Esther and Alicia Koplowitz agreed with their estranged
husbands, Alberto Alcocer and Alberto Cortina, known in Spain
as los Albertos, to divide the empire into the two zones of
influence. To maintain the group as an entity and avoid
possible fiscal charges, however, no shares are expected to
change hands. One result is intended to be the concern's
future passing to the two couples' six children, three on
either side.
   The nucleus of the group, Construcciones y Contratas, was
founded by Ernesto Koplowitz, the father of Esther and
Alicia, as a public works contractor in the 1940s. In the
1970s and 1980s, under the management of their husbands, who
are cousins, it grew to be one of Spain's most powerful
private business empires. But it failed in its most ambitious
project, launched in 1987, to gain control of Banco Central,
then Spain's biggest bank. The business conflict that ensued
led to tensions within the group, contributing ultimately to
the breakdown of the two couples' marriages.
   Under the agreement, the Koplowitz sisters will retain
control of Construcciones y Contratas, the construction
company Fomento de Obras y Construcciones S.A., the cement
company Portland Valderrivas S.A. and about 50 other
companies. Los Albertos will take charge of the group's
stakes in Banco Zaragozano, in Carlo De Benedetti's Spanish
holding company Cofir and in the planned Spanish
pay-television station Canal Plus, and will retain their
plush offices on the 43rd floor of Madrid's Torre Picasso,
owned by Portland Valderrivas, and two country estates. The
holdings involved have an estimated value of 10.6 billion
pesetas ($101.3 million).
   The pact brings to a close one of the most passion-filled
chapters of Spain's recent business history. Los Albertos
made repeated headlines in the past 2 1/2 years, first with
their abortive bid for Banco Central and later because of
their amorous affairs. They were the subject of a page-one
article in The Wall Street Journal in December.
