   In reference to a May 29 letter to the editor from David
B. Charnay, of Tarzana, Calif., on chic pets: Please, the
name of the noble breed to which he refers is spelled
Dalmatian, after the region of its supposed origin, Dalmatia.
   My two Dals, ages 12 and 5, would like you to note that.
This misspelling is a common error.
