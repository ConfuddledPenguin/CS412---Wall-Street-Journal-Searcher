   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc. dismissed its top
two marketing and sales executives, reflecting management's
concern that the computer retailer's performance in those
areas wasn't cutting it.
   The company said the two executives, James A. Heisch and
Murray Dennis, resigned. However, a company spokeswoman,
Beverley Bird, acknowledged that the two "basically" were
fired. Rumors that heads would roll in the marketing and
sales departments had been circulating for months, company
officials said.

   Mr. Heisch had been senior vice president, sales and
services. Mr. Dennis was vice president, marketing. Neither
could be reached for comment.
   Businessland has been plagued recently by shrinking
margins and a series of other problems that have dragged down
profits and left the company seemingly somewhat adrift. In
January, the company said it intended to trim as much as 10%
to 15% of its work force and to close poorly performing
stores. It had a loss of $1.7 million, or six cents a share,
on sales of $323.4 million in the third fiscal quarter ended
March 31.
   Furthermore, the company still hasn't recovered from a
bitter feud with Compaq Corp. Last year, Compaq's chief
executive, Rod Canion, cut off sales of its machines to
Businessland after Businessland's chief executive, David
Norman, criticized a new Compaq product. The two companies
re-established ties in March, but Businessland hasn't been
able to recapture many of the customers it lost as a result
of not being able to provide Compaq machines.
   Ms. Bird said the two executives weren't dismissed for any
particular gaffe. But she noted that both men started with
the company in fields other than marketing; Mr. Heisch had
been chief financial officer, and Mr. Dennis had been general
manager. "They both went into different areas where they
didn't have that much experience," she said. "We just feel
that we need more seasoned people in those roles, people with
large-company experience." She said a search is under way to
replace the two men.
   Analysts said one problem Businessland has faced on the
marketing side has been its inability to successfully
implement a decision to de-emphasize simple-computer
retailing and to broaden the company's so-called
"value-added" services, such as offering to tailor an entire
computer system to a particular business's needs.
   "They haven't been getting it," said Susan Yamada, an
analyst with Merrin Information Services Inc., Palo Alto,
Calif. "They're going to companies and saying, `We'll do this
and this and that for you,' but the companies are saying,
`Forget it.'" Businessland needs marketing and sales
executives "who know how to compete for that type of sale,"
she said.
   Ms. Yamada also saw the executives' departure as a
possible indicator that the company's fourth-quarter results
weren't good. She predicted that the company will have a loss
for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the nine
months, Businessland had net income of $1.4 million, or four
cents a share, on sales of $1 billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Businessland closed at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.
