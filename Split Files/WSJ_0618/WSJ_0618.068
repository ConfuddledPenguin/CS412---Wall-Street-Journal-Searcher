   WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department announced it will
comply with a federal court order and begin negotiations with
a TRW Inc. subsidiary on a possible award of a 10-year, $1
billion contract.
   TRW Environmental Safety Systems Inc. lost out in initial
bidding for the contract to a consortium led by Bechtel
Systems Management Inc., a subsidiary of Bechtel Group. But
TRW went to court and won a federal claims court order last
August barring award of the contract, as it was originally
solicited, to anyone but TRW.

   The Energy Department had been planning to appeal the
ruling. However, it announced Friday it is changing course to
try to prevent further delays in work on its high-level
nuclear-waste disposal program. The department said it will
drop its appeal "if a mutually satisfactory contractual
agreement can be achieved" with TRW.
   Although TRW wasn't the agency's first choice, it called
the company "a qualified contractor capable of successfully
performing the work." The contract is for systems
engineering, development and management services for the
government's waste program. The department currently is
evaluating a Yucca Mountain, Nev., site for possible use as
the first permanent dump for highly radioactive waste from
nuclear power plants.
   The department said the Bechtel-led consortium was barred
from receiving the contract "through no fault of its own."
TRW had alleged in claims court that the selection process
was illegal and that the department used different criteria
than it had said it would when it selected Bechtel.
