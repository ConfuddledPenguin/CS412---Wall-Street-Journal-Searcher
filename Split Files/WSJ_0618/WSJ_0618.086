   The federal government transferred the deposits of two
deeply insolvent thrifts in San Antonio, Texas, to Sunbelt
Savings of Dallas in hopes of creating an entity that will be
more attractive to potential buyers.
   Sunbelt assumed $2.1 billion in deposits from Bexar
Savings Association and Gill Savings Association, in a
transaction estimated to cost taxpayers about $1.68 billion,
the Resolution Trust Corp. announced.

   Sunbelt, a federally owned and subsidized thrift, was
created in the 1988 consolidation of eight S&amp;Ls that included
some of the most notorious thrifts from the Texas real-estate
bust. The government installed new management in hopes of
improving the institution's condition and eliciting investor
interest. But Sunbelt has been burdened by high-cost deposits
and a bleak lending market, and regulators now hope the
transfer of Bexar's and Gill's deposits will make Sunbelt a
more appealing acquisition target.
   Separately, the RTC said it sold its entire portfolio of
loan holdings in Alaska. The S&amp;L cleanup agency, under
increased pressure to speed sales of S&amp;Ls and their
investments, is beginning to make headway. The RTC has
targeted the sale of 141 institutions in the April-June
quarter, which would be its speediest pace ever. If all are
sold, about $200 million in operating costs for those thrifts
will be saved this year, said Lamar Kelley, who is in charge
of asset sales for the RTC.
   In what the RTC hopes will be the first step in a quick
disposal of its Alaskan assets, Security Pacific Bank Alaska,
the Anchorage-based unit of Security Pacific Corp., acquired
a portfolio of distressed loans, including commercial loans,
mortgages and consumer loans, for $29 million, mostly from
Home Savings of Anchorage. The loans were originally carried
on the thrift's books for roughly $70 million.
   The heavy write-down wasn't unexpected, Mr. Kelley said.
"These were severely distressed loans, so we were extremely
pleased with the transaction," he said. Security Pacific had
previously purchased the deposits of Home Savings.
   Moreover, a small amount of real estate holdings remain in
Alaska, Mr. Kelley said, and the agency expects to auction
the 352 properties, carried on RTC books at a value of $53.3
million. By selling all the Alaskan holdings quickly, the RTC
hopes to avoid the overhead of opening a permanent sales
office in the state, he said.
   About $140 billion of the RTC's $173 billion in assets is
held in financial instruments such as loans and securities,
and not all are performing. The agency hopes to begin
publishing a schedule of sales of loan packages this summer,
Mr. Kelley said.
   Several other loan packages were sold recently. American
Express Co.'s Lehman Brothers unit acquired $165 million in
commercial real estate loans originally held by Atlantic
Financial Federal Savings &amp; Loan, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The
package included separate pools of adjustable-rate mortgages
and fixed-rate loans.
   Other loan packages are to be sold in the form of
securities. First Boston Corp. has been selected to structure
a senior subordinated pass-through security to be completed
this summer for $350 million in single-family home mortgages,
and loans that aren't conforming with secondary-market
standards. These loans were originated by University Savings
&amp; Loan, Houston.
   The RTC is also in the final bidding stages for a $1
billion auto-loan operation from Empire of America, Buffalo,
N.Y., Mr. Kelley said.
   In the Sunbelt transaction, Sunbelt will absorb the
deposits of the two San Antonio thrifts, while the RTC will
retain all of their assets. The agency will advance $2.1
billion to Sunbelt, and asset sales are expected to reduce
the government's cost from this transaction to $1.68 billion.
   Gill had assets of $1.1 billion and liabilities of about
$2 billion, the RTC said, while Bexar had assets of $874
million and liabilities of $946 million. Sunbelt, with $9
billion in assets, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $7.4
million, which included an undisclosed amount of federal
assistance. It had repossessed assets of $2.57 billion and
past-due loans of $1.17 billion at year end, the largest pile
of bad assets at any thrift in the country.
   Other RTC actions Friday included:
   -- Unifirst Bank for Savings, Jackson, Miss., with $700
million in assets, was sold in a transaction that is expected
to ultimately cost the RTC $121.6 million. Mississippi buyers
of separate branches included Trustmark National Bank,
Jackson; Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., Belzoni; Merchants &amp;
Farmers Bank, Kosciusko; Hancock Bank, Gulfport; Newton
County Bank, Newton; Merchants National Bank, Vicksburg; Port
Gibson Bank, Port Gibson.
   -- First Savings &amp; Loan Association, Waco, Texas, with
$375.1 million in assets, was sold to Kilgore Federal Savings
&amp; Loan Association, Kilgore, Texas.
   -- Plano Savings &amp; Loan Association, Plano, Texas, with
$256.3 million in assets, was sold to First Gibraltar Bank,
Plano.
   -- New Mexico Federal Savings Association, Albuquerque,
N.M., with $201.9 million in assets, was sold to First
National Bank in Albuquerque.
   -- First Savings of Laredo, Texas, $175.5 million in
assets, was closed, and depositors are to be paid off within
several days.
   -- Sentinel Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Phoenix,
Ariz., with $171.5 million in assets, was sold to Biltmore
Investors Bank, Phoenix.
