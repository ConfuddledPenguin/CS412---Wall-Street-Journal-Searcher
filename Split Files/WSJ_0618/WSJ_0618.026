   WASHINGTON -- In the week since the Supreme Court struck
down the federal flag law, the debate has focused on whether
to amend the Constitution to protect the flag. But little
attention has been paid to how the proposed amendment would
work.
   At first glance, the amendment appears straightforward.
"The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag of the United States," reads
the text proposed in both the House and Senate and favored by
President Bush.

   But some constitutional law experts say that the wording
of the proposal, far from being straightforward, is ambiguous
and will lead to considerable uncertainty. "The proposal
creates a constitutional black hole," says Walter Dellinger,
a Duke University Law School professor and an opponent of any
flag amendment.
   The Supreme Court found that both the Texas flag law it
struck down last year and the federal law it invalidated last
week violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of
speech. Logically, then, a constitutional amendment to
protect the flag would have to modify the First Amendment.
   But the proposed amendment doesn't say what it would
modify, notes William Van Alstyne, also a Duke University Law
School professor. There is nothing in the proposal "that
suggests the First Amendment is to be deemed no longer
applicable to any state or national law providing penalties
for what the government may regard as the physical
desecration . . . of the flag," he says.
   Because the proposed amendment doesn't make clear its
effect on the First Amendment, Mr. Van Alstyne says, it is
possible that even if it is adopted the Supreme Court might
still find the Texas flag law unconstitutional under the
First Amendment when it is used to prosecute those who burn
the flag as a political protest.
   Mr. Van Alstyne argues that it is no accident that the
proposal doesn't mention the First Amendment directly. An
amendment that squarely removed "one particular kind of
symbolic expression" from the protection of the First
Amendment, he says, "would be unseemly" and "would embarrass
us."
   Mr. Dellinger says the proposal must be intended to alter
the First Amendment, because Congress and the states already
have the power to protect the flag in situations to which the
First Amendment doesn't apply. For example, the Supreme Court
suggested last week that Congress and the states still may be
free to protect publicly owned flags, and that Congress also
may be able to prohibit commercial exploitation of the flag.
   But Mr. Dellinger raises other concerns. The Supreme Court
has long held that laws restricting speech or other forms of
expression protected by the First Amendment are
unconstitutional if they are too vague or too broad. If 50
states and even more local governments pass new flag laws,
will they be subject to vagueness and overbreadth rulings, or
will they be exempt?
   And, he asks, what of the Eighth Amendment limits on
criminal sentences that are "cruel and unusual punishment?"
Are they applicable to new flag laws, or will they be swept
aside by the proposed amendment?
   Mr. Dellinger also notes that state and local governments
may define "physical desecration" in disparate ways. A city
or state could choose to include the waving of the flag at
political rallies or conventions as a form of physical
desecration, he says.
   Besides these uncertainties, there is another wild card in
the flag debate. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden, a Delaware Democrat, is drafting his own amendment,
which is intended to be less ambiguous than the one backed by
the administration.
   Moreover, congressional aides who are familiar with the
effort say Sen. Biden plans an approach like Prohibition,
which was established by the 18th Amendment. Aides say the
Biden amendment would prohibit desecration of the flag but
would say that Congress alone may pass laws to enforce it.
   Sen. Biden has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the
flag, but he isn't expected to reveal his proposal then. One
problem he faces, according to congressional aides, is that
he can't find constitutional law experts to testify in favor
of his plan.
