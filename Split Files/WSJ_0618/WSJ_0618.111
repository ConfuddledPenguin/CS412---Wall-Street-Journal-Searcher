   Wendy's International Inc., Dublin, Ohio, agreed to drop a
year-old lawsuit against Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.,
Anaheim, Calif., that related to conversion of 10 Wendy's
fast-food restaurants in Arizona to Carl's Jr. restaurants.
   Karcher bought the restaurants from Ronald Brown, owner of
Wendy's of Tucson Inc., a Wendy's franchisee, over the
objections of Wendy's International. Wendy's filed suit
against Karcher, Mr. Brown and his company, charging that the
transaction violated Wendy's franchise relationship.

   Under the settlement, Wendy's agreed to approve sale of
the restaurants and to drop its lawsuit, which sought damages
exceeding $100 million from Karcher and Mr. Brown. Karcher,
also a fast-food restaurant chain, agreed not to buy any
additional Wendy's restaurants without the consent of Wendy's
International.
