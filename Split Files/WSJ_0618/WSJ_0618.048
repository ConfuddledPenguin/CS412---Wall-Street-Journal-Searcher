   But Failure Persists

   Your April 24 page-one article "Report Cards: Connecticut
Grades Its Schools and Holds Officials Responsible" is a
tribute to a state that made a commitment to its children and
to the state's own destiny.
   I have found that government can no longer throw money at
a problem and expect it to go away. Illinois spends about $8
billion a year on education. Yet we have a 25% dropout rate
statewide, with 50% in Chicago alone. There are average test
scores, rampant drug abuse and a swollen bureaucracy.

   So, where's our education policy? What are the goals we're
trying to achieve? How will we know if test scores will climb
and drug use drop? How will we know tax dollars are going
into the classroom and not into the bureaucracy? Why should
we keep throwing money at this problem if we don't know
whether conditions are improving?
   State government must be held accountable for these
failures, especially when children can no longer wait for the
long-overdue federal standards to guide them.
