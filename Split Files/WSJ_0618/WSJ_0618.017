   PEND OREILLE COUNTY., Wash. -- "For Us, Every Day is Earth
Day," Plum Creek Timber Co. assured the Pacific Northwest in
an advertisement last April. Depicting a forester tenderly
planting a seedling, the ad concluded: "Our Roots are Here."
   But so are its stumps -- which may prove to be the
company's most enduring legacy.

   From the green mountain walls of western Montana to the
misty Cascades of central Washington, Plum Creek is
chainsawing a trail of profits and cut-over forests across
the Pacific Northwest. It is rapidly felling old-growth
forests, including trees that predate this nation by a
century or more. It has cut to the very banks of pristine
trout streams. It has bulldozed a road into one de facto
wilderness area and threatened to do the same to another.
   The land it is doing this to is its own, part of a 1.4
million-acre forest empire that was a gift from President
Abraham Lincoln himself. Nevertheless, Plum Creek, a publicly
held limited partnership spun off from Burlington Northern
Inc., has become one of the Pacific Northwest's most
controversial corporate citizens. By its own figures, the
company has been logging the forest Lincoln gave away at
perhaps twice the rate it can regenerate itself.
   "Within the industry, they're considered the Darth Vader
of the state of Washington," says Rep. Rod Chandler,
Republican of Washington, who is drafting more-restrictive
federal legislation covering private logging. "And I think
they've earned it."
   What is unfolding here is a case study in the public costs
of private decisions. It also demonstrates how a board-room
effort to maximize shareholder values can leave an enduring
mark upon the land -- and, some fear, perhaps contribute to
an economically crippling regional timber shortage in future
decades.
   Plum Creek's "only concern," charged an angry Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus after personally photographing a company
clear-cut in 1987, "appears to be cashing out their equity at
everyone else's expense."
   Plum Creek has grown accustomed to such talk. "There's no
question -- we can't deny the fact -- that we have a bad
image," says David Leland, president and chief executive
officer. He corrects himself: "Have had a bad image." He says
the company is reforesting its cut-over lands and argues it
has "tried to be good neighbors to the citizens who live
around us." He thinks the solution may lie in "more
professional publicity work," a better job of letting people
know "what we're doing and how we're going about doing it."
   Yet what Plum Creek does, and how it does it, has a way of
startling people.
   Last year it jolted Bozeman, Mont., by announcing plans to
log in South Cottonwood Canyon, an old-growth forest
treasured by hikers and hunters. Responding to anguished
citizens, Congress rushed through a $1 million
land-acquisition appropriation. But Plum Creek is holding out
for more. It now talks of bulldozing roads this summer.
Negotiations continue.
   Plum Creek also jolted northern Idaho last year by
bulldozing a logging road into prime elk habitat proposed by
both Gov. Andrus and Idaho GOP Sen. James McClure as a
special management area. After a furor, Plum Creek sold
12,055 acres for eventual exchange to the state fish and game
department. But the company continues to ask $1 million --
too much, environmentalists protest -- for the timber rights
on one key 640-acre tract. Logging there, at the headwaters
of an unspoiled trout stream, remains a possibility.
   Even what Plum Creek says, and the way it says it, also
has a way of unsettling people.
   Late last year, Rocky Mountain Regional operations
director Bill Parson spoke to the issue of "sustained-yield
forestry," in which forests are logged no faster than they
can regenerate themselves. On a company-sponsored tour of
Plum Creek operations, Mr. Parson told a Montana state
legislator: "We have never said we were on a sustained-yield
program, and we have never been on a sustained-yield program.
Let's get to the heart of it. Sure, it's extensively logged,
but what is wrong with that?" The company doesn't deny the
remarks, but CEO Leland says they are "not an accurate
statement" of company philosophy.
   Plum Creek's accelerated logging dates back to the early
1980s. One driving force is a voracious demand from Japan,
particularly for huge logs from ancient groves; the
beautifully grained wood looks exquisite in exposed-wood
construction. But increasing logging profits was part of a
larger Burlington Northern strategy, conceived in an era of
hostile takeovers, to boost shareholder values.
   Richard M. Bressler, chairman of both Burlington Northern
and Plum Creek, says Wall Street regarded Burlington Northern
as a stodgy railroad company, undervaluing its gas, oil and
timber holdings. "I was concerned that if we didn't do
something about that, somebody else would see those values .
. . and would do something to make those values known," he
says. "So that's when the scheme was hatched to separate the
business into its component parts."
   Thus, in 1988 Burlington Northern spun off Burlington
Resources Inc., an energy and natural-resources concern. A
year later, Plum Creek Timber was spun off as a limited
partnership. The spinoffs increased shareholder values by
"several billion dollars," says Mr. Bressler. Plum Creek also
loaded itself with $325 million in debt, another takeover
deterrent.
   Although little known nationally, Plum Creek is
intertwined with the nation's history. It is named for the
site of its first lumber mill, the Minnesota creek
immortalized by Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of "Little House
on the Prairie" and "On the Banks of Plum Creek." Today the
company is, after Weyerhaeuser Co., the Northwest's largest
timber owner.
   Its economic cornerstone is a framed document on the wall
of its corporate suites, signed "A Lincoln, Dec. 29, 1864."
Amid the Civil War, Mr. Lincoln granted the country's
railroads vast tracts of land as incentive to build lines to
the Pacific. A large share went to the railroads eventually
absorbed into today's Burlington Northern.
   For more than a century, Mr. Lincoln's timber grants were
treated as something of an afterthought. Even today,
volunteers Mr. Bressler, "I don't know anything about trees,
particularly."
   But buried within the land-grant document were always the
seeds of massive ecological disruption. The government
parceled out the lands to the railroads in corridors of
checkerboard squares, each square about three-fourths the
size of New York's Central Park. The railroads typically were
given every other square. Now the checkerboard on the map is
turning into ugly reality on the ground.
   A case in point is a company clear-cut here in the
mountains of northeastern Washington. Straight-edged as an
Iowa cornfield, oblivious to topography, the clear-cut runs
right up to the edge of a U.S. Forest Service square. On the
Forest Service side is a sweet-scented stand of cedar and
spruce, the ground springy with moss and the detritus of
decades. On the Plum Creek side is a desolation of stumps,
water-filled skid marks and roads that encoil the
mountainsides. Discarded beer cans litter the boundary
itself; an official Forest Service marker lies toppled in the
mud.
   "This is an accounting decision, not a forestry decision,"
charges John Osborn, a doctor and environmentalist who has
spearheaded the fight against accelerated logging. His fear:
"Plum Creek has already overcut their corporate forests. Now
they'll use their financial clout to {outbid others and}
overcut the public forests." The eventual losers, he
predicts, will be small sawmills and timber-dependent towns.
   Rep. Chandler shares that fear, foreseeing a timber
shortage that will approximately halve the next generation of
millerloggers. "I grew up in the kind of area where the dream
was to graduate from high school and own a logging truck," he
says. "I see a lot of dreams being smashed by what I consider
some pretty shortsighted decisions by private industry."
   The spreading blotches of logged-over land come at a
pivotal moment in Northwestern logging. "The timber wars,"
some call it. The leading protagonists in this multi-front
war seem alike only in their utter commitment to opposing
views.
   Environmentalist Osborn, who coordinates the Inland Empire
Public Lands Council, is a man driven by the ecological
destruction he sees all around him. His Spokane living room
resembles a military command post. Maps wallpaper every wall;
papers blanket the floor. Stuck to a file box is a one-word
sign: "Bugged." It is a warning to himself -- perhaps
unwarranted, he concedes -- not to trust the security of his
own phone lines.
   "We're kind of in the belly of the beast here," he says.
"The levels of intimidation are very high." Asked if he's
been threatened himself, his response is terse: "No comment."
   Dr. Osborn argues that the Northwest has reached the end
of the "timber frontier" -- the complacent certainty that
just over the next ridgeline would always be more virgin
forest to fell. "What's over the next ridgeline now is the
Pacific Ocean," he says. Of Plum Creek, he says: "There is no
more egregious example of rapid liquidation."
   "Liquidation" is a red-flag word to Mr. Leland, sitting in
Plum Creek corporate headquarters high above the Seattle
harbor. "As a matter of fact, we started accelerating our cut
in '82, '83 to get on to a sustained-yield cut," he argues.
"Our view, and the view of most people who have studied this,
is that to move from a natural stand to a managed stand we
have to get rid of the older, slower-growing trees."
   But Mr. Leland's own figures indicate something far
removed from sustained yield. Last year, he says, Plum Creek
cut 597 million board feet; this year it targets about 500
million; in a few years it expects to throttle down to 450
million. Even the lowest figure, however, is well above his
estimate of the annual growth rate of Plum Creek's forests:
About 250 to 300 million board feet. Moreover, a Plum Creek
prospectus last year put the figure even lower:
"Approximately 210 million."
   Much of Plum Creek's future course could be affected by
what is currently being discussed in the other Washington,
the nation's capital. Congress, concerned that the U.S. is
exporting jobs along with timber, is close to banning the
export of logs cut on state-owned lands; a similar ban
already applies to federal lands. But since neither ban would
affect private lands such as Plum Creek's, logging pressures
would if anything intensify there.
   In addition, Congress remains stalemated over Idaho and
Montana wilderness bills. In still another flashpoint issue,
the federal government must address the plight of the
northern spotted owl by June 23; declaring the tiny owl
"endangered" could well put great tracts of old-growth forest
off-limits.
   Meanwhile, there are signs that Plum Creek has become
somewhat more environmentally sensitive recently. For
instance, Marcy Golde, a leader of the Washington
Environmental Council, says the company has been "very
forthcoming" in negotiating standards for cutting in the
Cascades -- though she estimates that the company's
flexibility has come after it is already about two-thirds
done there. The company says its harvest is slightly less
than half finished.
   The company also now leaves buffers along streams, spares
individual trees where eagles and spotted owls nest, and
preserves tree corridors for wildlife migration. From the
air, they look like green sidewalks across cut-over areas.
Plum Creek says it is willing to swap ecologically sensitive
land for publicly owned lands elsewhere, but complains that
such swaps can take a decade. It has offered to sell land to
homeowners but, says Mr. Bressler, gets "very few takers."
   "Most people," he says, "would rather we own the trees so
they can look at them, rather than they own the trees so they
can look at them."
   But those moves have done little to assuage people like
the group of Spokane sportsmen who gathered one recent night
to hear from some Plum Creek middle managers. Dean Lydig, a
hunter and retired lawman, whipped out photos of Plum Creek
clear-cuts. "The land speaks for itself," he said, his voice
tight with emotion. "It speaks for itself."
   James K. Lehner, the easy-going manager of Plum Creek's
Coeur d'Arlene, Idaho, division, assured Mr. Lydig that the
company is trying to do better. Then he told the group:
"We've got a public-relations problem, and we've got a
problem where people just don't quite believe us."
