   Your May 10 page-one article "Getting Tough: SEC Under
Breeden Takes a Harder Line on Securities Crime" sounds like
the right man is in the right place at the right time.
   As one of thousands of grain and livestock producers who
despise the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we'd
welcome any ideas as to how we could get a clone of Richard
Breeden to take over as chairman of the despicably weak and
exchange-biased CFTC.
