   British pharmaceuticals group Wellcome PLC said the
Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European
Community recommended that Retrovir, Wellcome's acquired
immune deficiency syndrome drug, be approved for wider use.
   The committee has sanctioned the use of Retrovir in
patients other than those suffering from severe human
immunodeficiency virus infections, which include AIDS and
AIDS-related complex, Wellcome said.
