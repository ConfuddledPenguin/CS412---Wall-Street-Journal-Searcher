   BERN, Switzerland -- The Swiss wholesale price index
declined 0.1% in May from April and rose 1% on a year-to-year
basis, the government reported.
   The year-to-year rise was the smallest since January 1988.

<TEXT>
   The 1% rise compares with a 1.5% year-to-year rate in
April. In May 1989, however, wholesale prices were up 5.4%
from the same month in 1988.
