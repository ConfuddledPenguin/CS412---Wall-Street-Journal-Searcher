   ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Ireland's Department of
Health authorized the company to market the anti-viral drug
ribavirin for use in the "management" of patients infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus and other conditions
related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The approval, the Costa Mesa, Calif., company said, marks
the first time that a country has authorized the anti-viral
drug specifically for the treatment of HIV-infected patients.
Ribavirin already is used in the U.S. and in 16 other nations
for the treatment of infants and young children with severe
respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial
virus. Ribavirin is used in more than 30 additional countries
to treat other viral infections.

   ICN recently withdrew its request for U.S. government
approval to market ribavirin for the treatment of the HIV
virus.
   There were about 100 cases of AIDS in Ireland in 1989, and
about half of those victims have since died, according to an
ICN spokesman. He said researchers predict the number of AIDS
patients in Ireland will reach 12,000 by 1995.
