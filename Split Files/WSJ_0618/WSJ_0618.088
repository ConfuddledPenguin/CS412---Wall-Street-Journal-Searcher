   Station Sounds Out
   A Kids' Wavelength

   RADIO entrepreneur Christopher Dahl wants to become the
Wizard of Aahs.
   To put advertisers in touch with kids, he's trying to
establish the Children's Radio Network, a programming service
that would be distributed nationwide by satellite. His
prototype is called Radio Aahs, pronounced Oz.
   The format, being developed on WWTC-AM in Minneapolis,
includes youngster DJs spinning requests from listeners, a
call-in show, a theater of the air, Sesame Street-style
educational fare and reruns of such Golden Age of Radio shows
as "The Lone Ranger."
   If it works, Mr. Dahl's CD Broadcasting Co. hopes to link
up several dozen markets with feeds that would be
interspersed with live local programming. The target audience
is kids under 12, but the station figures it will reach
parents who are within earshot.
   "It's a market that hasn't been served," he says, adding
that many AM station operators are looking for a new niche.
"We're finding a lot of music out there that kids have been
listening to on their Walkman" that's not played on the
radio, he says.
   So far Radio Aahs has attracted advertisers such as
McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, the Target Stores division of
Dayton Hudson Corp., along with a record shop chain, a pet
store, an amusement park and even a car dealer. "A great deal
of buying decisions on cars are made by mothers and kids,"
Mr. Dahl contends.
   But some ads the under-age audience won't hear. Besides
such obvious no-nos as beer, Radio Aahs won't plug soft
drinks containing caffeine.

   The End of the Line?
   Overkill on Extensions
                                                                                                       

   LINE EXTENSIONS have long been a popular way to leverage a
lustrous brand name. Witness Arm &amp; Hammer, whose venerable
baking-soda franchise now has expanded into toothpaste,
fabric-softener sheets for dryers and room deodorizers.
   But brands, like businesses, can become overextended.
Eventually brand equity runs out, says Joel Rubinson, an
official of NPD Group Inc., a market research firm.
   Mr. Rubinson thinks the line-extension cycle has about
peaked. "There's a definite need for new brand names," he
says. In the 1970s, only 22% of the products tested by the
Port Washington, N.Y., concern were extensions; in the '80s,
that figure nearly tripled. Mr. Rubinson says a preoccupation
with product spinoffs has left some companies vulnerable
because they haven't put enough time or money into building
new brand franchises.
   As line extensions turn off consumers, some companies will
make brand acquisitions. Others will create new brands.
   That's what Honda Motor Co. did to market its Integra and
Legend luxury models. It launched the Acura brand rather than
add the cars into its Honda line. Similarly, to build new
foundations in pet foods, Mars Inc. dumped the Kalkan name
domestically in favor of three distinct labels, Whiskas and
Sheba for cats and Pedigree for dogs.
   But many companies still think line extensions are the
easiest way to go. And those managers looking for
acquisitions increasingly are likely to examine brand
beachheads for their line-extension potential -- and limits,
Mr. Rubinson says.
                                                                                                       

   Hoopsters Snuff Out
   Smoking, Cigarette Ads
                                                                                                       

   THE MINNESOTA Timberwolves are giving up smoking -- and
some big advertising bucks.
   When the National Basketball Association expansion team
moves into a new downtown Minneapolis arena this fall, fans
will be prohibited from lighting up anywhere in the building.
Most NBA arenas bar smoking in the game area but allow it in
the concourses.
   "We did it because I believe that if smoking were
introduced today it would be outlawed," says Marvin
Wolfenson, co-owner of the team.
   The ban goes beyond puffing. Tobacco advertising and
cigarette sales will be prohibited throughout the building,
which is shared with a health club. Mr. Wolfenson estimates
that the stand will cost the 'Wolves at least $500,000 a year
in lost ad revenue. "Sure it's a sacrifice," he says, "but we
think it's right."
   Alcohol is another story. The Timberwolves named Miller
Brewing Co. as the arena's exclusive beer vendor. Mr.
Wolfenson concedes it's ironic that Miller's parent is
cigarette giant Philip Morris Cos.
   Another NBA arena, the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City,
dodged a big beer-company ad revenue loss. Changes in Utah's
alcohol laws had forced the Palace to cover two large Coors
scoreboard signs, worth about $80,000 in revenue. But lawyers
found a loophole. The company will replace its beer trademark
with signs bearing the corporate name, Adolph Coors Co. The
rationale: The Golden, Colo., concern also bottles spring
water.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MCDONALD'S HOPES that its three new Fs -- "food, folks and
fun" -- satisfy its other big F: franchisees. Before rolling
out its latest marketing campaign, the chain got some
stinging criticism from licensee operators fed up with
earlier efforts. A recent survey found only 32% thought the
company's product promotions were working, compared with 77%
two years ago. A McDonald's spokesman says operators at last
month's national convention applauded the new ads. . . .To
push a book on child-rearing, Polybius Press of Houston sent
copies to hundreds of school superintendents asking them to
review "Mothers, Leadership and Success" for their local
newspapers. About 90 did.
