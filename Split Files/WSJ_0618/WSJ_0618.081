   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export Import Bank approved a $19.3
million grant and a $35.9 million loan guarantee for an
electric power plant project in Uruguay.
   The Ex-Im Bank said it dipped into its tied-aid "war
chest" for the grant after the French government offered a
similar subsidy in an effort to win the equipment contracts
for French suppliers.

   General Electric Co. will supply gas turbines and other
equipment for the power station from its factories in
Schenactady, N.Y., and Greenville, S.C.
   The guarantee will be on a loan provided by the Private
Export Funding Corp., New York, which is backed by a group of
U.S. commercial banks and other private financial
institutions.
