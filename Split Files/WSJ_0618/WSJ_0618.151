   NEW YORK -- Peter Canelo was right in mid-1987 when he
said it was time to sell stocks. Abby Joseph Cohen was right
immediately after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash in saying that a
recession wouldn't follow and that the time was right to buy
stocks.
   Today, Mr. Canelo is an unrestrained bull. He says the Dow
Jones Industrial Average could rise as high as 3350 before
the end of the year. Mrs. Cohen, now very much a bear, sees a
potential 25% drop in the stock market in the near term,
assuming interest rates don't decline further.

   These investment strategists can't both be right, and the
disparity of the positions they represent is producing a smog
of uncertainty that permeates the stock market these days.
   Mr. Canelo, of Bear Stearns, and Mrs. Cohen, of Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Research, dropped by The Wall Street Journal
offices last week for a debate about the market's future
course. The two-hour session was cordial, but the two
expressed sharply contrasting views of stock valuations,
earnings expectations, prospects for industrial growth, and
the outlook for interest rates.
   Mrs. Cohen believes the market is overvalued, that
investors have bid it up on the strength of overly optimistic
earnings expectations, and that the Federal Reserve Board
won't ease interest rates soon. She thinks investors ought to
be in bonds.
   Mr. Canelo believes the market is fairly valued. While he
agrees that earnings expectations generally are too high, he
is more optimistic than Mrs. Cohen, because he foresees a
surge in the industrial sector that Mrs. Cohen doesn't. And
he believes conditions may be right for the Fed to ease
interest rates, possibly as early as this summer.
                                                                                                       

   Stock Valuations
                                                                                                       

   "There's no measurement in my usual tool kit which tells
me this market is cheap," Mrs. Cohen says. "On a variety of
measures, this market is approaching the kind of valuation
levels you had in the summer of 1987. That's something that
doesn't give me great comfort."
   Mr. Canelo agrees that an overpriced market must top out,
but this isn't where the market is now, he says. "If you
think earnings {per share for the 500 companies in Standard &amp;
Poor's stock index} are $22, then the market is expensive,
but if you think earnings power is around $25 on the S&amp;P,
then price-earnings ratios are average for the last 25 years
-- 14.5."
   The critical factor, he says, is inflation. The ratio of
stock prices to per-share earnings falls when inflation
rises. So if inflation is moderating, a higher ratio is
acceptable. Even if earnings don't improve but inflation
continues to ease -- as Mr. Canelo expects -- then a ratio of
16 to 18 may be the result, which generally alarms some
investors. "I agree if multiples are too high, that's a
problem." he says. "I just don't think they're that high."
                                                                                                       

   Earnings Estimates
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Cohen believes the market has already been bid up on
the basis of sanguine earnings estimates. One consensus
measure says analysts are expecting the S&amp;P 500 companies to
earn a little more than $27 a share this year and $31.50 next
year. "If you believe those kinds of numbers, the market is
reasonabley priced," she says, but she is projecting $22 for
this year. "What I worry about is whether analysts and
investors are building into their heads -- when they pay
those multiples -- those consensus profit numbers."
   Mrs. Cohen believes earnings growth momentum peaked last
year. Mr. Canelo doesn't see a peak coming until the 1991
first quarter.
   Mr. Canelo agrees that consensus earnings estimates are
unrealistic. But "On the whole, I don't think investors are
that bullish," he says, noting that stocks are still
performing better than bonds. "The only time the stock market
has run into a valuation brick wall vs. bonds is when the
bond market is near or above the return on stocks. That was
the case in 1981, '84 and '87. We don't have that comparison
now."
   Mrs. Cohen, however, says that unless earnings do
fabulously well in the next two quarters, "There's going to
be disappointments" that will hurt stock prices.
                                                                                                       

   Industrial Growth
                                                                                                       

   At the core of Mr. Canelo's earnings-growth optimism is
the belief that the economy's industrial sector is poised for
a new surge. He believes that industrial prices, which were
weak in the fourth quarter, are firming, and that industrial
profits will soon follow. He notes that recent surveys of
purchasing managers indicate increased buying.
   Underlying this theme is Mr. Canelo's conviction that
Eastern Europe is providing a fertile new field for
industrial growth that will benefit U.S. companies.
   "Despite the continuing story on the Street that the
primary benefits from Eastern Europe will come to the
Coca-Colas and McDonald's and Levis, our greatest strength
and potential benefits come from the technology area," Mr.
Canelo says. "It's no accident that when the market was
tanking earlier this year, in January when interest rates
were rising, that some of the old-line technology stocks
actually rallied, along with some of the new-technology
stocks and some of capital goods companies. This is the
Berlin Wall coming down."
   But Mrs. Cohen doesn't expect such benefits from
developments in Eastern Europe any time soon. "Ultimately,
there could be quite a terrific benefit for U.S.
manufacturers," she says. "What I'm concerned about are the
mechanics of how that happens and the time frame. For
example, when you take a look at U.S. trade with Eastern
Europe, you've got to realize that less than 2% of U.S. trade
is done with Eastern Europe right now. Even if that were to
double, which I think is a grossly optimistic kind of
assumption in the near term, you're not talking about a very
big number."
   But Mr. Canelo says industrial companies are in better
shape than other businesses, because the era of merger mania
during the past five years generally bypassed the
industrials, "so their balance sheets actually look pretty
good."
                                                                                                       

   Interest Rates
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Cohen asks Mr. Canelo: "If you think the
re-acceleration {of industrial growth} has already begun, why
do you think the Fed will ease interest rates?"
   "Because you have softness in the consumer world," Mr.
Canelo replies, "which is more pronounced than any of us had
probably anticipated."
   Mr. Canelo believes gold prices are an important indicator
of Fed policy. "A 15% move {downward} in gold prices in the
past has always led to some kind of improvement in the
economy and one heck of a bull-market move in stocks," he
says. Gold has dropped that much since February.
   Mrs. Cohen, however, isn't convinced that the Fed is ready
to lower interest rates to increase liquidity. "Typically,
when you have a liquidity-driven market where it's the Fed
helping you out," she says, "you're emerging from a
recession, not from seven or eight years of continuing
growth."
   And while the Fed might decide to do something for
domestic purposes because of weak consumer spending, "There's
a limit to how much they can do, because ultimately they do
worry about the currency stability, and in a world with very
high real interest rates, there's a limit to how low rates
can go in the U.S."
   But Mr. Canelo counters, "Given the weakness in retail
sales, the slowdown in employment, a pronounced weakness in
gold and oil, it looks like the Fed might have some room to
continue easing. . . . If we get bond yields down to the 8%
area again, you're talking a market well over 3000."
   Mrs. Cohen responds: "Peter is answering the question,
`What could kill the bull market and is it present?' I'm
approaching it a different way, which is: `What's going to
start another bull market?' We are in the final stages of the
bull market, and I don't see anything that's going to give us
another major upward surge in equity prices."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Broader market measures closed little changed, but the Dow
Jones Industrial Average set another record high, driven by
program trading.
   Because several economic reports failed to provide
investors with a sense of direction, the market was pulled
and tugged by waves of trading related to the quarterly
expiration of stock-index futures and options, and options on
individual stocks.
   The industrial average gained 7.67 to 2935.89, a fraction
above the previous record of 2935.19 set June 4. For the
week, the Dow rose 73.51, or 2.6%.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.01 to 362.91;
the New York Stock Exchange composite index slid 0.12 to
197.86; and the Dow Jones Equity Market index fell 0.28 to
337.65. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1%; the Big Board
composite and the Dow Jones Equity Market indices each gained
0.9%.
   Expiration-related trading accounted for much of the
205,130,000 shares traded on the Big Board. Still, it was the
lightest trading on a quarterly expiration day, commonly
known as "triple witching hour," since Dec. 16, 1988, when
196.5 million shares traded. Declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange outpaced advancers 835 to 611.
   Many investors sat out the session to avoid "the inherent
volatility" that surfaces on triple-expiration days, said
Thomas Callahan, senior vice president at Yamaichi
International (America).
   The market showed little response to the news that May
consumer prices rose 0.2%; that the April trade deficit
shrank to $6.94 billion from $8.36 billion in March; and that
industrial production and capacity utilization rose in May.
None of the reports deviated sharply from expectations,
though bond prices dropped on the news that industrial output
gained 0.6%.
   Meanwhile, uneasiness about corporate profits continued to
haunt the market, traders said. Southeast Banking, which said
it expects losses for the second quarter and year, fell 2 3/8
to 11; the company also cut its quarterly dividend.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises fell 3/4 to 25 7/8 on 1.1
million shares, following the completion of a 2.15-million
share offering, sold at $26.625 a share.
   DeSoto skidded 3 1/4 to 40 1/4. Sutton Holding, which has
been pursuing a $50-a-share offer for the company, submitted
an alternative proposal, under which it would pay $45 million
for DeSoto's detergent business, following the sale of its
other operations.
   McDonnell Douglas's stock price had been dropping since
Monday amid concerns about its second-quarter earnings, and
it lost another 3/4 to 38 5/8. The company wouldn't comment
on its outlook for the quarter, but denied rumors that its
bankers have asked for a reduction in its dividend.
   Wahlco Environmental Systems, which said net income for
its current fiscal year would be about 10 cents a share below
an earlier estimate because of delays in expected orders,
fell 2 3/4 to 10 3/8. The company didn't give its previous
earnings forecast.
   Salant plummeted 3 1/4 to 2 1/2. The company defaulted on
its bank credit line, by failing to make $10.8 million in
principal and interest payments, and said it is reviewing the
possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing, along with
other alternatives.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.27 to 364.03, ending the week with a gain of 0.8%.
