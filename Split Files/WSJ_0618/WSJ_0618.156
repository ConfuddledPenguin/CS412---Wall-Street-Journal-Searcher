   "Dick Tracy," Walt Disney Co.'s much ballyhooed summer
movie release, opened last weekend on about 2,300 screens
around the country with a solid, albeit not mind-numbing,
showing. It grossed between $22 million and $23 million,
Disney reported.
   Industry sources independently confirmed these preliminary
results. "It augurs very well for the film," said Martin
Grove, box office analyst for Baseline, an entertainment
information service. He noted that the three-day gross was a
Disney record. Last summer, "Batman" broke box-office records
with a $40.5 million opening weekend.

   Three films vied for second place. Early indications were
that "Another 48 Hours," released by Paramount Communications
Inc.'s film unit, grossed about $10.4 million. And the
premiere of "Gremlins 2," from Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Brothers unit, took in about $10.1 million. Carolco
Pictures's "Total Recall" apparently finished fourth at $9.8
million. Official tallies are due out today.
   Although Warner officials had been upset that Disney would
include in its figures the sales of $12 to $20 "Dick Tracy"
T-shirts that counted as admission tickets for special Friday
morning showings of the film, the marketing ploy apparently
didn't have much of an impact on the box-office race.
Industry sources attributed only about $1.25 million of
Disney's gross to the T-shirt sales.
   The key for the new films' staying power will be their
second weekend: As each new mega-hyped release opens, it has
knocked back its predecessor: "Back to the Future III"
dropped 43% in its second weekend; "Total Recall" dropped
41%. "Another 48 Hours" is expected to have dropped 47%.
