   Moleculon Inc., Elizabeth, N.J., said a federal court
upheld Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc.'s patent for an antibiotic
that a Moleculon unit also sold.
   Moleculon said the U.S. District Court in New Jersey ruled
the patent valid on Bristol-Myers's cefadroxil. Moleculon's
Kalipharma Inc. unit had been selling cefadroxil imported
from Europe. A spokesman said the antibiotic accounted for
about 23% of Kalipharma's sales of $30 million in the year
ended last Nov. 30.

   The International Trade Commission in March found that the
patent was valid, a setback for Moleculon and another
marketer of cefadroxil, Biocraft Laboratories Inc., Elmwood
Park, N.J. Biocraft has settled its dispute with
Bristol-Myers. Moleculon said it expects a subsequent court
hearing on the assessment of damages to Bristol-Myers and
that Kalipharma intends to appeal the court ruling.
   Bristol-Myers officials couldn't be reached for comment.
