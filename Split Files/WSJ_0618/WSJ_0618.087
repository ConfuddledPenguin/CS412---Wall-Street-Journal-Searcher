   Your employer may be willing to pay you good money to get
out of the company health plan. Think twice, or maybe three
times, before you accept.
   More and more companies are offering such choices these
days in response to soaring medical costs and the growing
number of two-income families with overlapping
health-insurance plans.

   The idea is that some of those with duplicate coverage may
prefer to drop out of one of the plans in return for cash or
some alternative benefit. Companies, meanwhile, get to pare
their soaring medical costs.
   But although that can seem appealing, benefits consultants
say a careful comparison of what you'd be giving up and what
you'd be getting is essential. Employees, they say, should
pay special attention to details such as deductibles and
limitations on coverage. It's also important to know what it
would take to get back into the plan if you decide you want
to later.
   "It's something we hope {employees} don't take lightly,"
says Earl W. Hunt, director of employee benefits at Buffalo,
N.Y.-based Marine Midland Bank. About 20% of the bank's
12,000 full-time employees choose not to take medical
insurance every year, opting instead for as much as $400 in
cash or credits for other benefits, such as increased life or
disability insurance or extra vacation days.
   A recent survey of the 5,000 largest U.S. employers by
consultants William M. Mercer Inc. showed that 47% offer or
plan to offer "flexible benefits," compared with 23% just
five years ago. Most of these companies allow employees to
opt out of health coverage. Between 5% and 20% of workers do,
generally getting between $300 and $800 a year in cash or
other benefits.
   "It's partly financial, partly philosophical," says Steven
Fein of Towers Perrin, the New York-based consulting firm.
Employers are saying, "Who are we to tell employees what kind
of coverage they need?"
   Still, many companies require that employees have other
medical insurance before they can opt out of their own plan.
They "don't want someone {who didn't have insurance} sitting
outside corporate headquarters in a wheelchair" after an
accident, says Mr. Fein.
   But it isn't just a question of taking a $70-a-month
payment from one spouse's employer and paying $20 a month for
coverage from the other's. One policy may have a $150
deductible, another $300. One may pay 80% of most medical
expenses, the other 75%. Some plans pay for outpatient
psychological and psychiatric care, others don't.
   Employees have to determine "what coverage is available
and what level of coverage is important to them," says Joan
Gianico, first vice president, benefits compensation, of New
York's Republic National Bank. "We try to remind them of what
their individual circumstances are."
   Whether a plan covers prescription drugs, for instance,
can be important to someone taking regular medication for a
heart condition or asthma. A family with children might not
want to give up a plan that covers well-child care.
   Benefits professionals say the two key questions for
employees before opting out of a medical plan are how well
they would be covered in case of a catastrophe and how easy
it would be to get back into the plan if their circumstances
change.
   Limits on out-of-pocket expenses can vary from one plan to
another. Some plans set a lifetime maximum on payments, which
could have a severe impact on someone permanently injured in
an auto accident, for instance, who might require full-time
care for life. There are plans that would pay for 365 days of
hospitalization, while others only cover 120. Cancer, heart
disease or a premature birth can easily become a financial
disaster without adequate insurance coverage.
   Companies can be tough if someone wants to get back into a
medical plan. Most allow immediate re-enrollment if other
coverage is lost, as in the case of divorce or because the
spouse loses a job. But sometimes the deductible is higher or
pre-existing conditions aren't covered for some period of
time.
   Employees who just change their minds about coverage
generally have to wait for the annual re-enrollment period,
usually in the fall, to take effect the following Jan. 1.
Pre-existing conditions often aren't covered for the first
year, and some companies require proof of insurability,
usually based on a medical examination. "You may find that
you're not covered for just what you need {insurance} for,"
says Douglas Carey of Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire,
Ill., consulting firm.
   Few companies require actual proof of other coverage. In
such cases, the employee generally is required to sign a form
stating the name of the company providing the alternate
coverage. Mr. Hunt of Marine Midland says a recent survey of
employees did turn up a few who were going without medical
insurance, despite having signed a statement that they had
coverage.
   As tempting as the extra vacation days or cash may be to
the young and healthy, "it's real dangerous" not to have
medical insurance, says Mr. Carey of Hewitt Associates. "You
never know when you're going to be in an accident, when
something serious is going to happen. The fact is that
hospitals in this country treat you better if you have
coverage than if you don't."
   Companies surveyed last year by Towers Perrin said that
even in the event of a catastrophe, employees would have to
live with their decision to turn down medical coverage. A few
companies said they would help the employee find other
assistance, such as welfare. Mr. Fein, the consultant, says,
"If word got out that you could take the {cash payment} and
still be covered, everyone would take the cash."
