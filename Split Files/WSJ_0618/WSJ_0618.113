   LONDON -- South African platinum producers, the biggest in
the world, are buying the metal and an important byproduct,
rhodium, on the international open market because their own
mines and refineries aren't turning out enough, dealers say.
   The metal is being bought to meet sales commitments and
for stockpiling against the possibility of further production
disruptions, dealers explain.

   Mainly as a result of these purchases, platinum at $475 an
ounce is performing far better than gold, which is
languishing around $346 an ounce, a four-year low.
   Its premium over gold has widened to $129, or 38%, against
a premium of $90, or 21%, at the beginning of the year. In
the mid-1980s, platinum traded at a discount to gold.
   Meanwhile, the price of rhodium -- an important byproduct
that is used with platinum and palladium in "three-way"
catalysts to reduce auto pollution emissions -- soared to a
record $3,100 an ounce because of an acute shortage.
   "Earlier this year we gave the first customer who bought
rhodium at $2,000 an ounce a bottle of champagne," says Brian
Nathan, managing director of Ayrton Metals Ltd., London
platinum merchants. At the time, such a price, up from around
$1,250 last August, appeared extraordinary, he says. Now
rhodium's surge shows no signs of slowing. The U.S. General
Services Administration has advised the federal government to
buy 6,000 ounces of rhodium a year to build a stockpile of
30,000 ounces, Mr. Nathan says.
   Tight supply rather than robust demand is bolstering
platinum, rhodium and to a lesser extent palladium, dealers
say. The slim supplies are mainly blamed on the South African
mines, dealers say. They produced 2.6 million ounces of
platinum last year and accounted for 77% of world supplies,
says Johnson Matthey PLC, precious metals refiners and
distributors. The Soviet Union, the next biggest producer,
which last year sold 550,000 ounces or 16% of total supplies,
is also selling smaller amounts this year, Johnson Matthey
says.
   Secretive about their activities in the market, South
African producers are reluctant to disclose details of their
open market purchases.
   The buying could be from several sources, says Edwin
Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith
in London. First, there was a two-week strike last month at a
mine of Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd., the largest producer
in the world.
   Production at the operation, known as Atok, almost came to
a standstill and the loss of platinum output was nearly 4,000
ounces, estimates Mr. Arnold. Although the loss was small in
relation to Rustenburg's estimated annual production of 1.4
million ounces, the company probably needs to buy platinum on
the open market for a stockpile as a buffer against any
future disruptions, he says.
   The stockpile idea may look especially good to Rustenburg
because it was production difficulties at Rustenburg's
refinery earlier this year that precipitated the rhodium
price surge.
   Another factor in tight supplies is that output of a new,
though smaller South African mine, Barplats Mine Ltd., is
coming on stream later than expected, Mr. Arnold says. As a
result, the mine had to buy refined metal on the market to
meet sales commitments that were negotiated last year, he
says.
   Shortages of platinum, however, could be less critical in
the next few months, dealers say. Production at Rustenburg's
refinery is back to normal, says Jeremy Coombes, an analyst
at Johnson Matthey, a sales agent of the South African mine.
   Yet prices aren't likely to fall much because demand is
holding up. Although auto sales are declining in the U.S. and
Europe, says Mr. Coombes, the European motor industry needs
three-way catalysts to meet new anti-pollution standards in
the next three years. There are also more stringent
anti-pollution rules in the U.S., so their demand for
platinum and rhodium hasn't fallen.
   "Unless the Soviet Union increases sales, prices of
rhodium could continue to surge," says Oscar Prager, managing
director of Ayrton &amp; Partners Ltd., London metals merchants.
World supplies of rhodium are only a tenth of platinum
supplies, he says. But such a small proportion is used in
auto catalysts that the motor industry isn't concerned about
the price, he says.
   Despite short-term problems, South African platinum mines
are planning to raise production by one million troy ounces,
or 39%, during the next five years, Mr. Coombes says.
Moreover, supplies from South Africa "will rise in 1990 as
new mines build up capacity," he adds.
   Yet some analysts are wary and contend that strikes,
strife and cost inflation will pare the mines' expected
output over the next few years. Platinum will surge to $2,000
an ounce following violence, sabotage and eventually
nationalization of the South African mines, predicts James E.
Ryan, a Bellevue, Wash., precious metals analyst and author
of "Platinum -- The Metal That Could Make You Rich in the
1990's."
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   If tight gasoline supplies keep pushing prices higher on
the West Coast of the U.S. and East Coast supplies come under
pressure from an oil workers' strike in Brazil, gasoline
futures prices will continue their meteoric rise in trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, analysts say.
   The strength in gasoline, which tested trading limits much
of last week, doesn't necessarily mean good news for crude
oil, however. The July Nymex crude contract, which expires
midweek, fell sharply two days running last week, even as
gasoline made its strong showing. In fact, many trading
decisions were based in part on the relative difference in
prices between the two.
   Several disparate factors that might have helped the
overproduction picture didn't materialize. Oil workers in
Kuwait, a major producer, canceled a planned strike. The Mega
Borg, a Norwegian tanker that was on fire last week in the
Gulf of Mexico, failed to disrupt other tanker traffic. The
tanker, carrying 38.2 million gallons of crude oil, spilled
4.6 million gallons of its cargo before fires were
extinguished and the leaking stopped. Much of the spilled
crude burned, evaporated, was sucked up with skimmers or
eaten by microbes. Tar balls were expected to reach the Texas
and Louisiana coasts late yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Analysts predicted upward trends in the prices of corn and
soybean futures this week, after prices plunged late last
week as weather improved in some central growing regions. "I
think we're very close to the bottom price levels right here
at these ranges," said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource
Co., Chicago. Mr. Loewy said he expects the weekly progress
reports issued by Midwest states today to show that farmers
were unable to do much last-minute corn planting in
rain-plagued areas. That should support corn futures prices
throughout this week, he said. The deadline for planting corn
usually is early June.
   Soybean planting also is behind schedule in many Midwest
states, though a week of consistently good weather could give
farmers time to finish planting. Some analysts expect soybean
prices to rise for the week in sympathy with corn.
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices plunged Friday on a rumor that Brazil might
cut its selling prices, but analysts said they expected a
steady market this week. The July contract ended with a loss
of 10.65 cents a pound at $1.7950 after trading as low as
$1.7530.
   One analyst said the report was denied by the three major
Brazilian processors, who also said they had no present plans
for changing prices.
   The rumor was apparently sparked by a report that some of
the concentrate had been sold in Europe at a discount and
that price declines would follow, the analyst said. As a
result, widespread futures selling developed, causing prices
to fall below several main support price levels, which
accelerated the decline.
   One analyst said he expected prices to continue to be
steady for a while. Another said that although U.S. consumer
demand for orange juice has slackened somewhat because of
high prices, tight supplies should continue to persist during
the summer.
