   Edward Sargent, on how Washington Mayor Marion Barry was
once his role model, in the April Regardie's:

   . . . when black leaders blame racism as a major factor in
Marion's saga, they shame him, themselves, and blacks in
general. Such charges make us seem like wimps, for in effect
we're saying that the white man captured our king with the
easiest trick in the book: a willing woman, an intoxicating
substance, and a lair in swank surroundings.
