   Which of these futures do you prefer?
   (a) Between now and 2000, the American economy grows a
respectable 25%, but the Japanese economy grows a whopping
75%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   (b) Between now and 2000, the American economy grows only
10%, and the Japanese economy grows an anemic 10.3%.
   If you chose (b), you're in good company. I've posed the
same choice to several groups of people in recent months -- a
class of Harvard graduate students, a conference of
executives of large American corporations, a conference of
Wall Street investment bankers, a gathering of senior State
Department bureaucrats, a meeting of several hundred citizens
of Belmont, Mass., and a gathering of professional
economists. A majority of every group except the last voted
for (b). The economists all voted for (a).
   Why would so many people prefer (b)? The economists had a
hard time believing that thoughtful Americans willingly would
choose to sacrifice a gain in wealth of 15 percentage points.
The answer, I think, is that the non-economists looked at
relative gains. They don't want the Japanese to catch up with
us and then move ahead. The specter of an economic goliath
towering over the U.S. from across the Pacific frightens them
to the core.

   This is the dark side of America's relationship with Japan
that never gets talked about, but colors everything else.
Forget the trade imbalances, the negotiations over whether
they'll buy our baseball bats or allow Boone Pickens to buy
their companies, the interminable "structural impediments
initiatives" and summit meetings, the righteous American
indignation over Japanese "dumping" and unfair subsidies to
Japanese companies. We say that all we want is a "level
playing field," but that's not quite true. We also want our
team to remain bigger and stronger than theirs.
   Japan could agree to every one of our demands to buy more
American goods and invite in more American investors, and yet
the (b) problem would remain and probably get worse. The
Japanese economy is growing fast not because Japan keeps us
out but because the Japanese are investing like mad and
working like hell. America is growing slowly because
Americans are doing neither.
   Americans who choose (b) won't be satisfied until the
widening gap in the growth rates of Japan and the U.S. begins
to close and America regains the lead. But for this to happen
we would have to radically step up our investment in
factories, machinery, research, education, training, roads,
ports and everything else that would equip us to produce
more. And we'd have to work harder, longer and better. The
Japanese, on the other hand, would have to learn to live it
up -- stop investing as much and be less diligent on the job.
   ---
   If all this seems unlikely to happen, there's another,
more insidious, remedy the (b) choosers might ultimately
pursue. Disconnect the trade and investment lines between the
two nations -- lines that have fueled our growth and fueled
theirs even faster: Block Japanese imports, bar Japanese
investments, prevent the Japanese from acquiring U.S.
technologies. Both nations would lose -- but the Japanese
would lose more. America would sacrifice the gains of (a) to
prevent Japan from enjoying the much larger gains of (a).
   It has not yet come to this, but it may. American
anxieties temporarily subside each time the Japanese
cautiously accede to U.S. demands to open their market and
buy more American goods, as in the most recent accord. But in
a few months, when Americans once again ponder Japan's
growing economic might, the anxieties may come back even
larger than before.
   Are the (b) choosers irrational and irresponsible? Or are
they wisely responding to the "Realpolitik" of global power,
and the lessons of world history? I'm enough of an economist
to think it must be the former, but not so much of one that I
don't have a lingering doubt. I do know that unless we
confront the (b) crowd's fears openly and directly, our
long-term relationship with Japan will continue to
deteriorate -- regardless of how many American baseball bats,
modems, Toys `R' Us franchises, and Boone Pickenses they
allow in.
