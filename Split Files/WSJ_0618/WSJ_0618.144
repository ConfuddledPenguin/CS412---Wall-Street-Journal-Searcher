   WASHINGTON -- Here is James Watson's recipe for winning
support for a vast international science project: Taunt the
Germans for their fears about science, bash the Japanese for
"freeloading," and dish out money to your opponents to knock
the program.
   Somehow it works for Mr. Watson, the brash Nobel Prize
winner who heads the U.S. government's $3 billion effort to
decipher the human genetic code. "He administers by
petulance," says Norton Zinder, a biologist who chairs a
National Institutes of Health advisory committee for this
so-called human genome project.

   Mr. Watson compares the genome project's ambitious goals
-- mapping the body's 100,000 or so genes and figuring out
exactly how they're constructed -- to landing a man on the
moon. In contrast to the U.S.'s Apollo moon program, though,
he proposes that all major industrial nations share in the
cost of the work and the rewards, which could include new
medical technology, drugs and treatments. "Our main
motivation is to find out the nature of diseases," he says.
   In pursuit of this laudable goal, the 62-year-old official
employs a sharp-edged nationalism rarely seen among
scientists. His views reflect mounting fear among U.S.
officials that this nation can't keep its technological lead
without getting tough with competitors. For example, Frank
Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, is
pushing Japanese industry to pay U.S. colleges $100 million a
year to close a "training" trade gap that he says is produced
by the 24,000 Japanese students who study here. And the
Energy Department is pressing Japan and South Korea to
contribute a total of as much as $2.6 billion to its
superconducting supercollider.
   "Everybody is skittish; they {U.S. officials} are elbowing
people" to raise money from abroad, says Rep. Ralph Hall, a
Texas Democrat who chairs a House Science Committee panel on
international cooperation.
   No one has sharper elbows than Mr. Watson. He started his
international campaign last spring, hectoring Germany for
hesitating to join the genome project because of fears that
genetic information could be abused, as it was by the Nazis.
"This may tell us something about Germany," he told a
conference here. "That it's so horrified of what it did in
the past, that it's afraid to move into the future."
   Then he turned to Japan, whose government funds scientific
research at less than half the rate of the U.S. In July, he
sent three bitter letters to Kenichi Matsubara, a Japanese
scientist trying to organize a genome effort there. Unless
Japan coughed up more money for the genome project, Mr.
Watson implied, the U.S. would block Japanese scientists from
getting valuable research. "I have little enthusiasm for
being a supplicant before a nation that should much more
spontaneously begin to return the generosity with which
America has treated Japan ever since the war ended," he
lectured Mr. Matsubara.
   After the letter was leaked, Mr. Watson made his threats
about withholding data from the Japanese more explicit at
congressional hearings, which only added to his luster here.
According to William Raub, acting director of the National
Institutes of Health: "He's captured a set of concerns, if
not angst, of many in industry, high levels of the executive
branch and Congress."
   In Japan, the reaction has been one of consternation.
Nobuyoshi Shimizu, a Keio University scientist, called Mr.
Watson's letters "blackmail." Mr. Matsubara says he agrees
that Japanese science is underfunded but says "we don't work
according to his {Mr. Watson's} suggestions." Japan now
spends about $6.6 million on genome work, Mr. Matsubara
estimates, and may increase that next year to between $10
million and $13 million.
   But that's a pittance compared with the U.S. For the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the Bush administration proposes
nearly doubling genome funding to $155.9 million from the
current $87.4 million. Over 15 years, the federal government
is expected to spend $3 billion on the project.
   In light of those figures, Mr. Watson complains that
Japan's contribution "isn't proportional to their national
wealth." A U.S. genome consultant, Robert Cook-Deegan, wrote
Mr. Matsubara suggesting Japanese funding of between $30
million and $50 million, which he said should double in a few
years.
   Personality partly explains Mr. Watson's demands. He
revels in the outrageous. He made one of the century's
greatest discoveries -- the structure of the genetic material
called DNA -- then wrote a best-seller about it, twitting his
colleagues and competitors. He wanted John McEnroe to play
him in his life story, says a Watson aide, because he
identifies with the tennis star's rudeness and brains. He is
also miffed at the Japanese for inviting him to head a
proposed Asian research organization in the early 1980s and
never coming through with the money to start the project.
   But Mr. Watson can be a canny science politician, too; he
understands the effect his fame and stature have on people.
He prodded NIH to back the genome project and revise it, well
after the Energy Department originally proposed it. Then he
successfully lobbied Congress for extra funds for NIH, so
that it now dominates the joint NIH-Energy program.
   As NIH's genome chief, Mr. Watson has become the de facto
leader of the federal effort -- though he retains his other
position as head of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a
privately owned laboratory on Long Island that gets $13
million in NIH research grants. "Jim is standing like a
colossus over the whole program," says Mr. Zinder, who chairs
the NIH advisory panel.
   Mr. Watson's Japan initiative may turn out to be a shrewd
move. By publicly embarrassing the Japanese, he wins friends
in Congress for a project that has been bitterly attacked in
the U.S. by rival scientists, and he gives allies in Japan a
weapon to prod their government to increase spending on
science. The Japanese call this "gaiatsu," literally "foreign
pressure," but pressure of a kind that lets Japanese
bureaucrats make changes that they want to make but fear to
because of domestic opposition.
   "Watson makes this human genome project a big issue," says
Michio Oishi, a Tokyo University biologist trying to organize
the genome project there. "That makes the government want to
get into the business. It helps."
   Not all of Mr. Watson's attention is focused abroad, of
course. He helps set priorities for U.S. genome research,
lures leading researchers to join the project and brokers
deals among scientists whose work may overlap. Persuasion and
prestige are his main tools. At NIH, the power to direct
funds largely resides in independent panels of scientists
that judge the merit of research proposals, not in center
directors such as Mr. Watson.
   From the beginning, Mr. Watson also has insisted the
project spend at least 3% of its money studying the ethical
implications of genetic advances and holding town meetings on
the problems. Among the tough questions to be resolved:
Should employers and insurance companies have access to DNA
records of employees?
   Much of the ethics money will probably go to critics of
the program, worries Mr. Cook-Deegan, the genome consultant,
and that could backfire politically.
   So what, responds Mr. Watson. He has already charmed
Jeremy Rifkin, biotechnology's most vociferous critic, by
backing Mr. Rifkin's call for an "absolute" right of privacy
over genetic records. "On important issues, I find that it
pays not to hide your feelings," Mr. Watson says.
