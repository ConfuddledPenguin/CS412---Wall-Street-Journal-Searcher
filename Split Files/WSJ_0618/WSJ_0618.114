   Scott Paper Co. said it will form a joint venture with
Feldmuhle AG, a West German company, to own and operate
Feldmuhle's sanitary-tissue business.
   Scott, a Philadelphia-based maker of paper products, said
it plans to pay $125 million for a 51% stake in the joint
venture. At Feldmuhle's option or after three years, Scott
would have the right to acquire the remaining 49% of the
joint venture and would have to pay Feldmuhle an equivalent
price for that stake.

   The joint venture is subject to approval by the German
Federal Cartel Office and both company's boards. Scott said
it expects the joint venture to be formed in the fourth
quarter.
   Feldmuhle markets sanitary-tissue products in Europe and
manufactures tissue products in Germany and in the
Netherlands. The company had gross sales of about $300
million in 1989; Scott had European sales of about $1.2
billion in 1989.
