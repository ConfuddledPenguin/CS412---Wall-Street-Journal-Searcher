   For years, Donald Trump has said he never uses his own
money to purchase what he calls his trophies. But now it has
become clear that the developer personally guaranteed more
than $500 million of the $2 billion in bank loans to buy
them.
   If the troubled entrepreneur should be forced to sell his
major assets, and the proceeds don't cover the debt, he could
be left not only with a collapsed empire but with a huge
personal liability.

   And right now, the market value of his properties does
fall well short of the total amount of his indebtedness, both
his bankers and some of his advisers agree.
   Perhaps more ominously, a sale of most of Mr. Trump's
major properties now looks more and more likely. His bankers,
even as they consider a new $60 million credit, aren't
focusing primarily on trying to help him get back on his feet
so he can repay them. Instead, they increasingly are trying
simply to prepare for an orderly liquidation of assets.
   The only mystery remaining, several bankers say, is
whether the dismantling of Mr. Trump's real-estate and casino
empire takes place under the watchful eye of his creditors or
in bankruptcy court.
   In fact, says a person familiar with the Trump-bank
negotiations, Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened a
bankruptcy-court filing, telling the banks this could wipe
out a billion dollars worth of his debt.
   Mr. Trump, through a spokesman, declined comment over the
weekend. But while he has been uncharacteristically press-shy
of late, his few public remarks indicate he retains his
confidence. At his 44th birthday party in Atlantic City
Saturday, Mr. Trump told throngs of employees, according to
the Associated Press, that "over the years I've surprised a
lot of people. The largest surprise is yet to come."
   What that surprise may be is still anybody's guess. People
close to the negotiations say one positive development is
that talks are going on with a potential buyer of the Plaza
Hotel at a price greater than the approximately $450 million
Mr. Trump has in it.
   Such is the power of Mr. Trump's reputation that many in
financial circles continue to believe he will somehow
extricate himself from his troubles. Indeed, if the real
estate and Atlantic City markets took sharp turns for the
better, Mr. Trump could probably emerge from his troubles a
wealthy man.
   Mr. Trump's lead bankers now are demanding that he appoint
two top executives of Trump Organization -- a chief executive
officer and a chief financial officer -- a move that would
effectively rob him of day-to-day control of his own
operations. Mr. Trump, who now functions as chief executive
himself, is resisting the effort to replace him in that
position, though not the CFO appointment.
   On Friday, Mr. Trump's situation grew more precarious as
he missed the deadline on $43 million in payments on Trump
Castle bonds, and a $30 million payment to Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. If he does not come up with the money within 10
days, he could be held in default, a move that could lead to
his first loss of an asset to creditors, one of his three
Atlantic City casinos. A default also would put Mr. Trump in
jeopardy of losing his New Jersey casino licenses.
   Beyond this, a default could have consequences for the
rest of his empire as well. A single default, one of Mr.
Trump's bankers says, could trigger other defaults. Mr.
Trump's largest bank creditors are units of Bankers Trust
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp, and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. All four banks formally declined to comment.
   Last week Mr. Trump and his major creditors agreed to a
new $60 million credit package. Some of Mr. Trump's smaller
bank creditors are opposed to the plan. Mr. Trump's major
bankers continued to work through Saturday to persuade them
to go along.
   But even if Mr. Trump gets $60 million in breathing room,
it is unlikely to help preserve his wealth. The idea behind
the plan, say several bankers involved in the discussions, is
to wait until Mr. Trump's assets rise in value to avoid
fire-sale prices.
   "The misconception people have is that the $60 million
would give Trump time," says one person familiar with the
negotiations. "In fact, it is the banks who bought the time
to have an orderly sale of his assets" -- a strategy that may
prove risky given the current real estate and gaming markets.
   The disclosure over the past two weeks that Mr. Trump had
personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in bank
loans have come as a surprise even to some of his closest
aides. Most of these personally guaranteed loans were made
within the past two years, when Mr. Trump's celebrity status
was at its peak.
   Developers usually shun such guarantees. But for the
supremely self-confident Mr. Trump, such personal guarantees
appear to have been a key part of his leveraged modus
operandi. In fact there are indications the guarantees could
total over $600 million.
   The loans he guaranteed include three from Citicorp: $135
million on the money-losing Trump Shuttle, $125 million on
the Plaza Hotel in New York and $60 million of a construction
loan for the Trump Palace condominium tower in New York. Mr.
Trump also is believed to have guaranteed a personal loan
from Bankers Trust for over $100 million, a $75 million loan
from First Fidelity Bancorp on the Taj Mahal casino in
Atlantic City, N.J., a $10 million loan to buy his yacht and
various personal lines of credit. The yacht loan is from
Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.
   The missed bond payment Friday caused the prices of Mr.
Trump's three casino bonds to spiral downward. Moody's
Investors Service Inc. also lowered its rating on the bonds
secured by his new Taj Mahal casino.
   After the close of business Friday, First Fidelity said it
planned to resign as the Trump Castle bondholders trustee, to
avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. It also is a
major Trump creditor. Before resigning the account, the bank
sent a notice of default to Mr. Trump, and said that if the
payment was not made within 10 days, an event of default
would occur.
   There could be serious repercussions for other properties,
say bankruptcy experts, if so-called cross-default provisions
exist allowing other creditors to start calling in their
loans too after a first default. "If one project is in
default and it's owned by an entity with other interests, it
could be a problem for him," says Alan Kornberg, a lawyer
with the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.
   According to one banker involved in the talks, certain
such loan agreements exist, providing for creditors to claim
a loan is in default if Mr. Trump defaults on any other
asset. Those provisions raise the ante; if Mr. Trump fails to
make his bond payments within 10 days, he could default on
other properties too, giving creditors the right to
foreclose.
   Following two weeks of grueling negotiations, Mr. Trump's
four major bank creditors suspended their negotiations for
Father's Day. They are expected to be back at the table this
morning, trying to win over the smaller creditors to their
plan to extend $60 million in credit and suspend interest
payments on existing debt. Bankers say they are no closer to
an agreement than they were a week ago. Under the plan, all
of Mr. Trump's assets would be cross-collateralized, and the
money from asset sales would be thrown into a single pool.
   Banks would then take money from asset sales according to
their share of the loans. By extending further credit, the
banks are in effect betting $60 million that orderly,
well-spaced-out asset sales would bring them much more than
would a distress sale. Because some of Mr. Trump's largest
loans were syndicated to smaller creditors, about 70
institutions are involved in the discussions. Participants in
the negotiations say there are at least three major hurdles
still to be overcome.
   First, Citicorp, which has lent Mr. Trump over $1 billion,
has yet to persuade its pool of 54 creditors to go along with
the deal. The group, which includes banks from Japan,
Ireland, Brazil, South Korea, Italy and France, is an
unwieldy consortium; in particular, the banks with superior
security are reluctant to go along with a deal that puts them
on par with banks with lesser security.
   Another obstacle remains the 11 or so banks that have
purchased portions of Chase's $75 million loan securing the
retail and commercial space in Trump Tower, overlooking
Central Park. Those predominantly foreign banks are said by
people close to the discussions to be unwilling so far to
have their strong collateral mixed in with the less-secured
assets.
   Finally, Mr. Trump's New Jersey bankers, which include
First Fidelity and Midlantic, are similarly unwilling to pool
their loans with the larger banks' less-secured loans.
   Just as Mr. Trump has used the threat of a bankruptcy
filing against the major creditor banks, they have used such
a tactic against smaller creditors. They've told the smaller
creditors that even if their collateral is strong, collecting
could take years in the event of a Trump bankruptcy filing.
Thus it is in their interest to compromise, big creditors are
telling them.
   If the banks do patch together a deal in the next week and
a half, Mr. Trump and his creditors are likely to immediately
begin the painful process of selling off the exceptional
properties the high-profile developer has acquired over the
past decade.
