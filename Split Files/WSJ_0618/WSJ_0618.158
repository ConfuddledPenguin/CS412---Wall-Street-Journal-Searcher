   NEW YORK -- The third and "final" reading on first-quarter
economic strength is likely to be unchanged, but that's about
where agreement ends.
   Consensus holds that the government's third version of
first-quarter gross national product, due Thursday, will be
unchanged from the 1.3% annual growth rate estimated in May.
Still, many economists expect wrenching revisions in July
when the government tidies up past reports with annual
benchmark and seasonal revisions. What's more, some analysts
disagree on just what GNP numbers mean these days, revised or
not.

   The week's other indicators include May housing starts and
building permits, durable goods and personal income and
consumption.
   Real GNP, or the value of the nation's total output of
goods and services, is only one of the indicators whose
reliability has been questioned lately. But it is an
important one because GNP is a critical part of both
policy-making and economic forecasting.
   David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Jesup &amp; Lamont
Inc., believes that the "dramatic deterioration" in the
quality of GNP data obscures the fact that "we're in a
recession now." On the other hand, Michael R. Englund,
economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.,
defends a brighter GNP outlook. He notes that he raised his
second-quarter GNP forecast a bit to 2% from 1.8% Friday
after favorable reports on both May industrial production and
the April trade deficit.
   Mr. Bostian says that recent downward revisions to 1989
data indicate that this past year was weaker than generally
thought. What's more, he adds that revisions to industrial
production dragged the second half of 1989 into negative
territory, and that revised estimates of 1989 wage and salary
income suggest a broad overstatement.
   He believes there's a "50-50 chance" that GNP reports for
both the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of this
year will be revised to show negative growth. Mr. Bostian
adds that the economy may be close to a "real-time" negative
GNP in the third quarter. Based on recent weak indicators,
including this past week's report on a drop in May retail
sales, he says: "The economy is going to slow down further.
So, we are going to see one or more negative {GNP} numbers."
Mr. Bostian acknowledges that his is one of the more
pessimistic economic views these days.
   A survey of GNP forecasts taken by MMS after Friday's data
were disclosed showed positive, albeit small, growth
forecasts. The consensus view called for GNP growth of 1.5%
in the second quarter, 2.1% in the third quarter, and 1.7% in
the fourth quarter -- all down 0.5 percentage point or less
from the mid-March consensus.
   MMS's Mr. Englund has one of the rosier views. He defends
his outlook by noting that recent, unusually bumpy data only
mask some fundamental, long-term changes in the nature of the
economy. In short, Mr. Englund holds that U.S. economic
strength has been moving geographically to West from East,
spatially to small from big, and sectorally to aerospace from
autos. So, classic indicators like industrial production are
skewed toward large auto makers and tend to undercount the
contribution of smaller companies.
   "The composition of the economy at the end of this
recovery is quite different than at the beginning," says Mr.
Englund.
   Economists are keeping a close eye on consumer spending,
which so far continues to be one of the economy's main
engines. The consensus view on May personal consumption, due
Friday, calls for a small increase of 0.2%, following April's
0.6% gain. Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group, Providence, R.I., says spending on services
probably grew 0.7%, only to be offset by a 0.7% decline in
goods consumption. The consensus view on May personal income
calls for a gain of 0.4%, down slightly from April's gain.
   Economists say durable goods orders in May probably
rebounded with the help of better aircraft orders. The goods
report, due Friday, is expected to show an increase of 2%
following April's 4.3% drop.
   May housing starts, due tomorrow are expected to have
another lackluster month, slowing to an annual pace of 1.22
million units from 1.25 million units the month before.
