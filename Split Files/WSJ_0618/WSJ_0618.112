   Tomkins said it entered into an underwriting agreement
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., London, covering a rights
offering to Tomkins shareholders in the U.K. that will
provide most of the funds for the acquisition. Barclays
agreed to purchase any shares not purchased by Tomkins
holders under the rights offering, Tomkins said.
   Philips is a Dayton, Ohio, maker of windows, bathtubs,
air-moving equipment and certain other items for residential,
commercial and industrial buildings, mobile homes and
recreational vehicles.
