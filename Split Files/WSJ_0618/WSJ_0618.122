   The war on penny-stock fraud is heating up in several
states, and the latest shot has been fired by Colorado, a
hotbed of penny-stock trading since the turn of the century.
   Colorado passed a law this month that will vault the
state's notably lax securities regulation "into the
mainstream," says Philip Feigin, the state's securities
commissioner. In cracking down, Colorado follows the path
taken in recent years by a number of former penny-stock
havens including New Jersey, Utah and Florida.

   "Everybody knew the Denver penny-stock game was nothing
more than gambling," says William McDonald, chief of
enforcement for the California Department of Corporations.
"It was anarchy out there for a long time. So was Utah. Both
of them have improved."
   The states aren't waiting for lawmakers in Washington to
pass a recently proposed bill that would strengthen federal
policing of penny stocks. They have already joined forces
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to chase
after scams in low-priced stocks.
   Penny-stock fraud generally involves shares that sell for
$1 or less.
   And there are signs that penny-stock abuse may be abating,
says Joseph Goldstein, chairman of a two-year-old SEC task
force on the matter. For the six months through March, the
SEC received 1,075 complaints of penny-stock fraud. That pace
puts it well behind fiscal 1989, when a total of 3,776 such
complaints were filed.
   Some regulators, however, are skeptical, expressing doubt
that deceptive salesmen of cheap shares will abandon their
lucrative swindles for long.
   "Some penny-stock firms are going away," says Deborah
Bortner, assistant securities administrator for Washington
state. "But for a lot of these people, it's the only way they
know how to make a living. They may be gone shortly, but
they'll figure out a way to get back." Penny-stock fraud
costs investors in the U.S. an estimated $2 billion a year,
according to the North American Securities Administrators
Association, a group of U.S. state and Canadian regulators.
   Colorado's new law, modeled on a measure Utah adopted in
1986, takes aim at "blind pools" in which investors put up
money to buy stock in a company without any definite business
purpose. Colorado now requires that money invested in a blind
pool remain in escrow until a business plan is adopted and
the state securities commissioner is notified.
   In Utah, the tactic helped slash the number of blind pools
to just five (raising $500,000) in 1988, compared with 217
(raising $19.8 million) five years earlier, according to the
North American regulators' group.
   Nationwide, about 70% of all new penny-stock offerings in
recent years have been blind pools, the group says. Promoters
typically raised $50,000 to $200,000 at a time by selling
millions of shares of stock, for pennies a share, in
businesses that generally had no assets, no employees and no
written business plan.
   Colorado's new legislation requires that all securities
offerings be registered with the state, creates licensing
requirements for broker-dealers and sales agents, and beefs
up state enforcement powers. Although the new measures are
aimed at restoring investor confidence in Colorado offerings,
they don't have quite the teeth that other state laws do, Mr.
Feigin says. "We'll see how that works."
   Colorado's penny-stock operators already are "treading
water," says Frank Birgfeld, director of the National
Association of Securities Dealers' Denver office. He ties a
slowdown in low-priced share promotions to the 1987 stock
market collapse, greater public awareness of stock fraud and
a new federal rule making it tougher for brokers to take
advantage of first-time customers.
   In Washington, the SEC's Mr. Goldstein says shady dealers
have been pressured by the SEC's "cold-call" rule, which took
effect Jan. 1. Designed to protect unsophisticated investors
from high-pressure telephone sales tactics, the rule requires
brokers to determine whether an investment in penny stocks is
financially suitable for first-time customers.
   California's Mr. McDonald says the regulation has been
largely responsible for cutting to six from 22 the number of
penny-stock brokers in that state.
   Mr. Goldstein also praises heightened public-awareness
campaigns and tougher policing by state regulators. In a
joint effort with the SEC, Florida has become a model for
apparently successful crackdowns coordinated with federal
authorities.
   More than one million brochures warning investors about
abuses by investment dealers were mailed to Floridians with
their utility bills, banking statements and corporate and
state employer letters, Mr. Goldstein says. Titled "Don't Be
a Victim of Penny Stock Fraud" and printed in English and
Spanish, the brochures describe frequently used high-pressure
sales tactics, risks involved in trading penny stocks and how
to file complaints. A toll-free advice number is provided.
   Florida, after more than doubling its enforcement staff,
in 1988 put 70 examiners, attorneys and investigators to work
full time on penny-stock abuse, says Florida Deputy
Comptroller Larry Fuchs. Complaints are beginning to decline,
he says. Since Jan. 1, 10% of all complaints received by his
office involved penny-stock investments, down from 31% in the
first half of 1989. Since January 1988, the state has revoked
the licenses of 3,800 of Florida's 142,000 registered
securities agents, he says.
   Georgia and Southern California inherited a number of the
illegal dealers who fled Florida, Mr. Fuchs says. Georgia
recently passed legislation to fight the proliferation of
abuse there. California regulators are struggling to keep up
with a growing number of "boiler-room" salesmen of
commodities and other investment vehicles, rather than
penny-stocks, says Mr. McDonald.
   To avoid U.S. regulators, some penny-stock operators are
moving their operations offshore to Latin America and Pacific
island countries, some regulators say. "We can't get bank
records in those places," says Washington state's Ms.
Bortner.
   Also on the rise: a phenomenon in which broker-dealers who
have lost their licenses (or others who want to evade
licensing requirements) suddenly surface in branch offices of
licensed firms. They identify themselves as financial
consultants or account executives, aggressively tout penny
stocks and reap large profits for the branch office.
   "That's the coming way out of getting out of registering
as broker-dealers," Ms. Bortner says. "They are popping up as
owner-operators of branch offices."
   Crooks will remain elusive as long as their profits
outweigh the penalties and settlements they may have to pay,
she says. "I've seen agents with $30,000, $40,000 settlements
-- four or five of them" -- who are still active, she says.
"Even though some of them may be slightly sleazy, they have a
pretty easy time of keeping jobs" if they produce big
profits.
   Restricting blind pools at the federal level might further
curtail the penny-stock market, suggests Ms. Bortner, who is
vice chairwoman of a committee on penny-stock telemarketing
for the North American securities group. The reason: Blind
pools still can register in states with lax laws. Limits on
blind pools are part of a federal bill introduced in April by
Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of a House Finance
subcommittee.
