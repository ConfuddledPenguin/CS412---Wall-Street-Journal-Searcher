   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Caesars World Inc. said it signed an
agreement with Cosmo World, a Japanese development concern,
to manage a non-casino luxury hotel as part of a $600 million
master planned community near Henderson, Nev.
   The 1,228-acre Cosmo World project, situated roughly 15
miles from Las Vegas, will include 2,500 homes, a
championship golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, a tennis
complex and other facilities. The project, called Silver
Canyon, is scheduled to open in 1992.

   The 350-room hotel, Caesars Canyon Resort, would be
Caesars' first non-casino luxury resort. Caesars also
operates honeymoon properties in the Poconos, which are aimed
at a middle-class market.
   Caesars World didn't break out the details of its
management contract with the developers, but Henry Gluck,
Caesars chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company may consider other joint projects with Cosmo World in
the future. He also said the company's newly created Caesars
World Resorts subsidiary will seek similar projects, mostly
through management agreements.
   Cosmo World executives couldn't be reached to comment.
Cosmo World builds and operates golf courses in Japan, where
it currently has six courses under construction. The company
recently opened a golf course in Salzburg, Austria, and is
planning other projects in the United States and Europe. The
company also makes golf clubs and professional photography
equipment.
   Silver Canyon, as well as other planned projects, is part
of a new wave of development here that regional officials say
will help position the area as a destination resort rather
than just a gambling mecca. The Cosmo resort also is designed
to attract international visitors who travel with families or
who dislike staying in a casino-hotel.
   Mr. Gluck said the hotel venture is part of the company's
efforts to cash in on the Caesars name, which is particularly
well known in the international market. "We have a tremendous
consumer franchise," Mr. Gluck said.
   Some Wall Street analysts, however, have voiced skepticism
about Caesars' other marketing ventures, such as its
fragrance line. Also, they note, major new competitors in
Caesars' key casino markets are targeting the company's
high-rolling clientele. Mr. Gluck said the resort will be a
good marketing tool for its casinos, and doesn't demand the
hundreds of millions in capital that Caesars would need to
launch a similar project by itself.
   Despite the added competition to its casinos, Mr. Gluck
said Caesars' basic business remains strong. The retail
shopping project at its flagship Caesars Palace, which is
scheduled to open in late 1991, is already 65% leased, he
said.
