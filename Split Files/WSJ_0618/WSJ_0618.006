   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said it extended
the expiration date of its $1.2 billion tender offer for
MGM/UA Communications Co. by another week. The offer now
expires Friday.
   Pathe Communications's $20-a-share offer, launched last
March, has already been extended several times, and this
latest delay was expected. The originally agreed-upon
"drop-dead" date is June 23. However, "if all parties agree,
it's possible" there could be another extension, a Pathe
Communications spokesman said. An MGM/UA representative said,
"additional discussions would have to be scheduled" if Pathe
Communications asked for more time.

   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to lend Pathe Communications
$650 million toward the transaction in exchange for certain
distribution rights to its films and a security interest in
the valuable United Artists film library. Pathe
Communications has indicated it won't meet all the terms of
its agreement with Time Warner, but Time Warner has already
made one concession and discussions are continuing about
more. Despite the complexity of Pathe Communications's
financing and the fact that Pathe Communications principal
Giancarlo Parretti is appealing a prison sentence in Italy
for fraudulent bankruptcy, Time Warner is believed to be
anxious to see the transaction completed.
   Pathe Communications last week revealed that it is raising
about $368 million from a variety of European asset sales and
bank loans. The company has already deposited $200 million in
cash as a down payment.
   MGM/UA shares closed Friday at 18.625, down 37.5 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Separately, Mr. Parretti suffered another blow as France's
Finance Ministry, citing a threat to "public order," blocked
his latest effort to take over Pathe Cinema.
   Mr. Parretti's Paris representatives said they would fight
the French move.
   The government decision doesn't have any direct impact on
Mr. Parretti's main holdings, which are grouped in Pathe
Communications. Despite the similar names, Pathe
Communications and Pathe Cinema aren't legally related.
