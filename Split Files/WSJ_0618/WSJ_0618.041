   NEW YORK -- Despite turbulent times marked by lots of
executive changes and several big write-downs, book
publishers are enjoying healthy sales, which are expected to
continue to grow about 8.3% a year for the next five years,
according to a new industry survey.
   The Book Industry Study Group, a trade group with members
including publishers, manufacturers and distributors of
books, is releasing its annual Book Industry Trends survey
today. The group forecasts "steady growth" in book sales for
the next five years, though at a slightly lower rate than in
the past several years. Total U.S. book sales, excluding
exports, are expected to reach $21.1 billion by 1994 from an
estimated $13.1 billion in 1989.

   But the survey states that the sales advances "will be due
far more to price advances than to increased unit sales."
Thus, the expected 8.3% annual increase in book sales
translates to an average 3.1% rise in unit sales. For most of
the '80s, total book sales rose about 8.4% a year, with the
growth rate shooting up to 8.8% from 1985 to 1989.
   Breaking down the forecast by categories, the group said
it expects the substantial gains of the 1980s to continue for
professional, trade (general-interest fiction and
non-fiction) and especially juvenile (from toddler to teen)
books. Juvenile books have been growing faster than any other
category, about 17% a year for the past five years, and by
1994, they sales are expected to account for more than 25% of
all trade books.
   Because of the economic crunch in many public school
budgets and the cyclical nature of textbook adoption in major
states, school books are expected to show the slowest growth,
increases of only 6.6% in sales and 1% in unit sales. The
group forecast only modest growth in mail-order books, which
could be hurt further by expected postal rate increases.
   Seymour Turk, treasurer of the Book Industry Study Group,
said publishers got "unnecessarily nervous" in late 1989,
because a huge jump in sales of general-interest books from
1988 to 1989 was followed by a decline in sales growth and by
climbing numbers of books returned unsold from bookstores.
   Industry specialists said publishers became
over-aggressive in recent years in the advances paid to
authors and in the initial number of copies printed. Then,
when the growth of the big bookstore chains slowed in the
late '80s, the pipeline more or less backed up, and
publishers weren't prepared for it. The sense of crisis in
publishing was further fed by the continuing consolidation
after a period of big publishing mergers; some big publishing
houses are still saddled with heavy debt loads and some have
cut staffs.
   Still, the optimism of the forecast doesn't surprise
Robert Di Romualdo, chief executive officer of Book Inventory
Systems Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., which operates 10 enormous
bookstores and supplies books for other megabookstores
stocking about 100,000 titles.
   "Our sales have been healthy for a long time," Mr. Di
Romualdo said. "We hear so much about illiteracy and the
drop-out rate that we tend to forget there are more college
graduates in this country today than ever before. And there
are more categories of books than ever before. There's been
explosive growth in areas like self-help, medical and
science, computer books, cookbooks, diet books and all kinds
of gift books. Women today wouldn't consider having a baby
without buying 10 books about it." More than 57,000 titles
were published in 1989; the total has been edging up for
years.
   Also unsurprised by the forecast is Richard Snyder,
chairman of Paramount Communications Inc.'s Simon &amp; Schuster,
who said press coverage of the publishing industry in 1989
focused too much on short-term upheaval at a handful of
publishing houses. "We are still in a golden age of book
buying," Mr. Snyder said. People who are between the ages of
35 and 50 buy the most books, he said, noting that many baby
boomers now fall within that range. "That's prime book-buying
time," he said. "They are affluent enough to buy books and
they are educated and read more. They also buy a lot of books
for their children, much more than previous generations."
   Simon &amp; Schuster took a $140 million write-off in its past
fiscal year, mainly related to the adoption of more
conservative accounting methods for educational publishing,
and Mr. Snyder conceded that in trade publishing, the company
"had been profligate, as had many other companies," spending
too much on advances and printing too many copies. But he
said the company has become much more disciplined, publishing
more selectively and becoming more efficient in a variety of
areas, including manufacturing and order-taking.
   Mr. Snyder agreed with the industry group's robust sales
forecasts for professional, trade and children's books, but
said he believes the forecast for elementary and high school
textbook sales is too low. He said he anticipates some form
of "peace dividend," with money formerly used to fight the
Cold War available for domestic problems. "I don't know how
much money it will be, but I believe some of the money will
be used to strengthen our schools, and that will help
textbook sales," Mr. Snyder said. "This country must educate
its children better to be competitive in the global economy."
