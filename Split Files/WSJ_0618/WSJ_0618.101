   ROME -- Italy's unadjusted index of industrial production
rose 1% in April from a year earlier, the state statistical
institute Istat said.
   Istat said the index, on which 1985 equals 100, registered
116.0 in April, compared with 114.9 in April 1989.

   The index was based on 19 working days in April, the same
as in April 1989.
   The increase in April followed a year-on-year rise of 2.8%
in March.
   Industrial production in the first four months, which had
a total of 83 working days, rose an average of 2.1% from the
year-earlier period, which had 82 working days.
   In the first four months, production of capital goods rose
5.9% from a year earlier. Production of consumer goods was up
1.2%, while output of intermediate goods was up 1.5%.
   The increase in capital goods was due to an 8.5% rise in
the production of transportation goods, a rise of 5.9% in the
production of machinery and equipment and a drop of 1.6% in
the production of other goods.
