   TOKYO -- Chrysler Corp. will soon get help selling its
vehicles from an unlikely ally -- Honda Motor Co.
   Honda, the target of a recent Chrysler advertising
campaign, said it agreed to help the No. 3 U.S. auto maker
sell its Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler models in Japan beginning
this fall.

   Honda said it plans to sell 2,000 Jeep models in 1991.
Chrysler sold only 1,500 cars and Jeeps in Japan last year.
   Honda and Chrysler officials previously disclosed they
were negotiating a distribution agreement, but details
weren't announced until Friday.
   A Chrysler spokeswoman said there is "potential for
discussion about Honda distribution of other Chrysler
vehicles" but declined to elaborate.
   Honda, which doesn't build off-road vehicles or minivans,
said it entered into the agreement to help broaden its appeal
in the Japanese market. A Honda spokesman said the Chrysler
ad campaign that claims Chrysler models are superior to
Honda's Civic and Accord never deterred the Japanese company
from going ahead with the marketing alliance.
   "This agreement is not a matter of helping anybody; it's a
matter of Honda dealers expanding sales," the Honda spokesman
said.
   Honda said it will sell and service Chrysler vehicles
through its 1,375-dealer Primo chain.
