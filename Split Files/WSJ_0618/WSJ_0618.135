   First Commerce Corp. said its nonperforming assets have
increased $14 million since March 31 and are $6 million
higher than it reported at the end of the second quarter of
1989. The primary reason, it said, is the placement on
nonaccrual status of several credits at the New Orleans bank.
   Nonperforming assets now total about $79 million, or 3.4%
of all loans.

   The company's provision for loan losses is expected to be
about $12 million for the second quarter, compared with $8
million in the first quarter and $6 million in the
year-earlier period. Because of weaknesses in the loan
portfolio, bank officials said, second-quarter earnings are
expected to fall in a range of 35 to 40 cents a share,
compared with 62 cents a share in the first quarter and 58
cents a share a year earlier.
