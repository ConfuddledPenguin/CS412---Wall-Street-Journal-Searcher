   LOS ANGELES -- Telecredit Inc., a provider of
check-guarantee and credit-card processing services, said
that it is holding talks with several companies about a
possible business combination.
   "Telecredit believes it is in the best interests of its
shareholders to explore the possibility of such a
transaction," said Lee A. Ault III, chairman and chief
executive officer.

   Telecredit told shareholders last year that it was
considering various ways to use its excess cash, including a
stock buy-back, recapitalization or leveraged buy-out. After
"we were approached by some companies of substance, we
thought we might as well include {a merger} as one of the
alternatives, " Mr. Ault said Friday.
   The announcement propelled Telecredit shares up $9.375 to
$52.50 in national over-the-counter trading. Nearly 1.2
million shares changed hands, more than 25 times the stock's
average daily volume. The closing price gives Telecredit a
market value of about $578 million.
   Telecredit is best known for its check service used by
retailers and other merchants to verify customers' personal
checks. If a check bounces after Telecredit approves it,
Telecredit "purchases" the check from the retailer.
Dominating the market, Telecredit guarantees more than $7
billion of checks annually.
   Credit-card and debit card processing services, mainly for
MasterCard and Visa transactions, make up the other main part
of Telecredit's business. The company's customers are 1,700
credit unions and small and medium-sized financial
institutions that don't process their own credit-card
payments.
   Analysts suggested that Telecredit's suitors probably are
large financial institutions seeking to expand existing
services or add new ones. Most banks wouldn't be interested
because they wouldn't want to reduce their regulatory capital
by putting substantial goodwill on their books, the analysts
said.
   Mr. Ault wouldn't describe the suitors, but he said that
"the only {companies} that make sense would be those where
there is a strategic fit and they have some size to do it."
   The board hasn't set a deadline to review the options, but
the process "won't drag on for a long time," he said.
Telecredit has retained Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons Inc. as financial advisers.
   Telecredit isn't widely followed by securities analysts,
possibly because its niche business doesn't neatly fall into
any large industry group. Joseph A. Stieven, an analyst at
Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St. Louis, counseled clients Friday
to "take profits" because the stock "could drop as quickly as
it came up" if a transaction doesn't materialize.
   Mr. Stieven, who has followed Telecredit for four years,
praises management for achieving pretax profit margins of 27%
for the nine months ended Jan. 31. After more than 20 years
at the helm, Telecredit's 53-year-old chief executive, Mr.
Ault, "is highly energetic and has sharp people working for
him."
   One of Telecredit's attractions is that it throws off a
lot of cash. The company currently has about $82 million, or
$7 a share, in cash and no debt. While earnings growth has
slowed a bit in recent years, analysts are forecasting future
growth of about 13% to 15% a year.
   Telecredit was hurt in recent years by the disappointing
performance of a subsidiary that launched a computerized
system to prevent counterfeiting of stocks and bonds. The
unit, most of whose operations have been phased out,
accounted for $38 million in operating losses in fiscal years
1984 through 1988, one analyst calculated.
   In the year ended April 30, 1989, Telecredit posted net
income of $24.9 million, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of
$158.7 million. For the nine months ended Jan. 31, the
company had net income of $21.9 million, or $1.98 a share, on
revenue of $129.2 million.
