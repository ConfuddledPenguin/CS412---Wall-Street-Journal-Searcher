   JERUSALEM -- Pushed by rapidly rising housing prices,
Israel's consumer price index rose 1.6% in May, the
government announced.
   The rise in the index, which measures price changes in a
fixed market basket of goods and services, compares with 2.5%
in April and 0.9% in May 1989.

   The government-run Central Bureau of Statistics projected
that inflation for the year would probably be about 18%, or
little changed from the three preceding years.
   The bureau attributed May's increase to price rises for
fruit and vegetables, clothing, footware and housing. The
housing component climbed 2.2% during the month, the bureau
said.
   Housing costs have been pushed up by a shortage caused by
an influx of Soviet Jews to Israel, expected to reach up to
150,000 this year.
