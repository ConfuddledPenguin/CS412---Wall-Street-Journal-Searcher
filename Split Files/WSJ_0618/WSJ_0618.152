   NEW YORK -- Salant Corp., which emerged from bankruptcy
court three years ago, said it may again seek Chapter 11
protection after defaulting on a $10.8 million payment of
bank debt.
   The news sent Salant's shares tumbling $3.25 to close
Friday at $2.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
wiping away more than half the company's market value. Salant
had 3.4 million common shares outstanding at the end of 1989.
At this time last year, the shares traded in a range of
$24.50 to $28.

   The apparel manufacturer, which owns Manhattan Industries
Inc. and Denton Mills Inc., said that in addition to
defaulting on the payment of interest and principal, it had
failed to comply with certain covenants in its credit
agreements with its banks. And it said it was not able to
make an interest payment of $1.9 million on its 13.25% senior
notes, which was due Friday.
   Moreover, the company said it didn't expect to complete a
new factoring arrangement on its accounts by Friday, as it
had hoped, or to amend its credit agreements.
   The company said in a statement it's "in discussions with
its lenders concerning the refinancing of its credit
arrangements, and is continuing to review its financial
conditions and its options, including among others, whether
it should seek relief from its creditors" under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Telephone calls to Salant and its investment banking
advisers at Lubin Delano &amp; Co. for an explanation on the
company's announcement were not returned.
   The past year has been difficult for Salant. The company,
citing a depressed retail environment, posted a loss of $2.3
million, or 67 cents a share, in the first quarter. A year
earlier, it posted a loss of $427,000, or 12 cents a share.
Sales fell 7.8% to $101.9 million from $110.5 million.
   In 1989, although revenue rose 27% to $469.6 million, the
company reported a loss of $9.35 million or $2.72 per share
compared with a profit of $7.65 million or $2.10 per share
the year before. Most of that came from a $6.5 million charge
in the 1989 second quarter after closing its Perry Ellis
Portfolio for Women division.
   The company reported at the end of 1989 that long-term
debt totaled $169 million, with $19.8 million due in 1990.
Shareholder equity in 1989 fell to $16.5 million from $31.6
million in 1988.
