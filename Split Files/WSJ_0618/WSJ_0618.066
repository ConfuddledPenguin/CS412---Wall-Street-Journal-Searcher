   NEW YORK -- The exchanges' battle for positions in the
budding after-hours stock trading market is heating up.
   Today, the American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options
Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC
of Britain are expected to announce a major nighttime trading
effort. The strategic alliance between the U.S. exchanges and
Reuters is a direct response to the New York Stock Exchange's
recently announced after-hours trading proposals.

   The alliance will mark an unprecedented partnership
between two big options exchanges, the Amex and CBOE; the
latter is the world's largest options exchange. The
consortium also will expand Reuters' already powerful
foothold in electronic trading systems.
   The plan also could revive interest in the lackluster
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which trades about 500 Big Board
issues electronically but in relatively light volume.
   The new after-hours trading system, to be announced at a
news conference in Chicago and New York this morning, is
primarily designed for options trading, according to people
familiar with the still-incomplete negotiations. The network
is to be built by Reuters and isn't expected to be in
operation until next year at the earliest.
   The new Amex-CBOE network could accommodate after-hours
trading in most Big Board issues in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index. It wasn't clear whether the system will run
all night, but it would be capable of doing that. The system
could match orders for stocks and options, such as the
Instinet electronic trading network, a Reuters subsidiary,
and provide market making through traders who already deal on
the three exchanges.
   Officials of the Amex and CBOE, the main partners in the
new options network, wouldn't comment prior to today's news
conference. A Reuters spokesman declined to discuss details
of the project.
   The partnership between the Amex and CBOE comes at a
moment of increased competition for both exchanges --
possibly with each other. Under a mandate from the Securities
and Exchange Commission, options listed for trading after
Jan. 22, 1991, may be traded on more than one exchange. And
the SEC requested that by June 30, exchanges come up with a
system to link their markets, so investors can have access to
the best price. A person familiar with the alliance between
the exchanges said the after-hours system could serve as a
partial response to SEC demands. On Jan. 21, all exclusive
options-trading privileges will be eliminated.
   Options give a holder the right, but not the obligation,
to trade a security at a predetermined price within a set
period.
   The new options network completes other efforts toward
after-hours trading of securities by U.S. exchanges. Besides
the plan for periodic night trading of stocks at the Big
Board in New York, the Globex system for after-hours trading
in currency and interest rate futures is under development by
two Chicago exchanges and Reuters. The big S&amp;P 500
stock-index futures contract could be put on Globex, once the
system is up and running, executives of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange said. Trading on Globex is expected to
begin as early as November.
   But there is much skepticism about how many investors will
use all these products. Last week, Big Board Chairman John J.
Phelan Jr. indicated that he is still gauging demand for
after-hours trading. A person familiar with the Amex-CBOE
consortium said the customer base has yet to be discovered.
Still, he said, the options exchanges believe they have to be
prepared for after-hours trading, especially because of the
Big Board's move.
   "If night trading on stocks becomes common, it's only
logical we'll have options, too," an exchange official who is
familiar with the plans said.
   Despite the questions about customer demand, the new stock
and options network represents yet another potential threat
to the New York Stock Exchange, the central stock market for
the biggest U.S. stocks. The Big Board has stepped up its
after-hours trading efforts, to head off erosion of its
traditional trading volume to electronic, regional and
overseas markets.
   "It's going to be a real challenge for the New York Stock
Exchange, but the ultimate alignment {in nighttime trading}
is still in question," a person close to the talks said.
"Everybody is positioning."
   The Amex and CBOE, which account for about 75% of all U.S.
options trading volume, have other products in addition to
stock options that might be attractive to investors, once
after-hours trading in stocks takes off. The Amex lists the
Major Market Index options and the CBOE lists the Standard &amp;
Poor's 100-stock index options, both favorites of program
traders and other large investors looking to hedge their
stock portfolios.
   A person familiar with the Amex-CBOE plan said it wasn't
clear whether the two big option-index products will be
listed on the new electronic system, rather than just options
on individual stocks. But it is possible. Also, just as in
the Big Board's proposed new system, the Amex-CBOE plan has a
different role for the exchanges' market makers on the floor;
these people wouldn't be physically present during the
after-hours electronic trading, but are expected to have some
role and possibly share in the profits.
   Meanwhile, the over-the-counter market is gearing up for
after-hours trading, as well. The National Association of
Securities Dealers' Nasdaq automated quotations trading
system is scheduled to launch an after-hours trading venture
Sept. 1.

   OPTIONS LISTED for trading since Jan. 22, 1990, may be
traded on more than one exchange under a Securities and
Exchange Commission mandate. Yesterday's edition misstated
the year the mandate took effect.
