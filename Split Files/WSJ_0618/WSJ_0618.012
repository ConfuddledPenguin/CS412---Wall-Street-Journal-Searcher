   Just Don't Want to Visit There

   If you're looking for a rustic summer vacation, West
Virginia has a few vacancies these days.
   That's because the Mountain State got cut from a "Third
World in the U.S." tour of Appalachia. The reason: West
Virginia is too remote, even for this tour.

   Global Exchange, the San Francisco group that organized
the tour, says it would take too long to get to West
Virginia. Besides, local officials weren't exactly receptive
to a group that compares their state to the Third World.
   "If they're looking for the Third World, they don't have
to leave the state of California," grouses John H. Brown Jr.,
West Virginia's commissioner of tourism and parks. "They've
got more poor people in the barrios of Los Angeles than we
have in the whole state."
   West Virginia officials suggested that the group skip the
southern coal fields, a depressed region, and focus on the
state's scenic charms: lakes, mountains and golf courses.
"They suggested we come and go white-water rafting," says
Laurie Adams, tour planner.
   No dice. These are reality tours, says Ms. Adams. So the
10-day trip, which began yesterday, will skip West Virginia
and focus on Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. Nine people,
including a teacher, a convention planner and a film maker,
have signed up for the $500 excursion to coal mines, farms
and rural households.
   So West Virginia feels a bit left out. "I'm disappointed,"
says Mr. Brown. "I didn't mean to keep them from coming."
   Folks in the states still left on the itinerary express
mixed feelings about the tour. Ms. Adams has received some
nasty letters and irate phone calls from residents who are
fed up with the stereotypes of their mountain communities.
"One person wrote to say she never married her cousin and has
used an outhouse only once," says Ms. Adams.
   For their part, Kentucky officials say they welcome any
visitors to the Bluegrass State. Jim Carroll, a state tourism
spokesman, considers the tour's name offensive, but "we
haven't taken it too seriously."
   Personally, he questions the premise of a so-called
reality tour by these city slickers from the West: "Reality
in San Francisco is an oxymoron," he jokes.
   But Mr. Carroll says Kentucky officials might turn out to
greet the out-of-towners. "We just hope we have enough time
to put on our shoes and kick the pigs out of the yard before
they get here."
