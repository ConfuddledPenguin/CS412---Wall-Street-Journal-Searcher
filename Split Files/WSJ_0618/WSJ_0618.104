   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. and International
Business Machines Corp. said they will jointly develop an
improved computerized publishing system that permits
publishers to add business and other functions to the
electronic system.
   Kodak, of Rochester, N.Y., has been selling Atex
publishing systems for several years. The systems control the
editorial, advertising and production activities involved in
publishing a newspaper or magazine. Kodak said it will
contribute that expertise, focusing on imaging and publishing
systems software.

   IBM, White Plains, N.Y., the world's largest computer
company, is a major supplier of computerized business systems
to the publishing industry. IBM will provide technical,
marketing and development assistance and some financing for
the project. The big computer producer and Kodak both
declined to disclose how much financing IBM will provide.
   Kodak, a photographic products, chemicals and drug
company, has a sizable office-equipment business.
   Automation suppliers in the past few years have been
developing systems that include sales, purchasing,
administration and other functions in the same computerized
system that controls production. The Kodak-IBM venture
intends to supply such a system for publishers. In addition,
they want to establish a system that can readily accept and
communicate with other equipment that third parties currently
manufacture, Kodak said.
