   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's foreign trade surplus narrowed to
1.4 billion kronor ($229 million) in May from 2.4 billion
kronor in April but was wider than the May 1989 surplus of
700 million kronor, Statistics Sweden said.
   The national statistics agency said preliminary May
figures showed that exports totaled 29.8 billion kronor, up
9% from May 1989, while imports amounted to 28.4 billion
kronor, up 7% from the corresponding month last year.
