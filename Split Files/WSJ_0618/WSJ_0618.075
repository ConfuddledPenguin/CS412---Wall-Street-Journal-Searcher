   MADRID -- The Madrid stock exchange plans to spend 1.1
billion pesetas ($9.6 million) to launch Spain's first share
options market, expected to come into operation sometime in
1991, officials said.
   As a first step, a 340 million peseta agreement is
expected to be signed in Frankfurt this week covering
computer software, technical assistance and personnel
training.

   The system to be acquired is the DTB system in use on the
Frankfurt stock exchange. That system is based on the Zurich
stock exchange's Soffrex system, Madrid officials said.
   The total cost of the project, including the computer
equipment, is expected to be about 1.1 billion pesetas. The
Madrid exchange hopes part of this cost will be borne by
Spain's three regional stock exchanges, making the options
market a joint project.
   Separately, market sources said Volkswagen AG of West
Germany is expected to become the first foreign company
quoted on the Madrid stock exchange. They said Volkswagen
shares are expected to be quoted in the next few weeks in the
form of depositary receipts.
