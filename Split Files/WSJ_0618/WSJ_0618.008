   Bell Atlantic Corp. and U S West Inc. said they were
selected to form a joint venture with Czechoslovakia's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to build and operate
a cellular telephone network.
   Under the arrangement, the Czech ministry will own 51%,
and the two regional Bells together will own 49%. Bell
Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, and U S West, based in
Denver, said they expect to invest about $60 million over 10
years to develop the analog cellular network for the Eastern
European country. Both companies view the award as a
strategic victory.

   As part of the agreement, the companies will have
long-term opportunities to help the Czech ministry upgrade
the country's telephone system. Even the cellular system they
are planning is likely to be upgraded at some point in the
future because most of Europe already has adopted a digital
standard.
   Czechoslovakia has a population of about 15.5 million and
about 2.2 million telephone lines. Czechoslovakia's serious
need for more and better phone service "warrants our
attention," a U S West spokesman said. "As an example, there
are about 300,000 pending orders for service in
Czechoslovakia that cannot be accommodated by the present
wire-line system."
   Construction on the cellular network is expected to begin
in the third quarter, with service starting in mid-1991. A
Bell Atlantic spokesman said his company and U S West expect
to pay for design, construction and operating costs of the
venture with hard currency, while wages would be paid in
local currency.
   Steven Andrews, president of U S West's international
unit, said the Czech award and the cellular network that U S
West is already building in Hungary provide "a firm base"
from which to develop "a wireless network serving Eastern
European customers."
   For Bell Atlantic, the agreement was its second
international victory in a week and its first successful bid
in Europe, a market all seven regional Bell companies are
eager to enter. Bell Atlantic views the cellular award as a
foot in the door. "This is hardly the end of it," a Bell
Atlantic spokesman said.
   On Wednesday, Bell Atlantic announced that it, along with
Ameritech, had been selected to buy New Zealand's state-owned
telephone system. Two New Zealand companies, the Freightways
Holdings Ltd. conglomerate and Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd.
merchant bank, also will have a small share.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Bell
Atlantic closed at $51.125 a share, down 62.5 cents. U S West
finished at $37.875, up 37.5 cents.
