   Six years ago, Roger and Joyce Stewart were seeking a
sideline business that their son could help run.
   On a visit to Dallas, the Tucson, Ariz., couple saw a busy
Steve's Ice Cream outlet, marked by a product made fresh
before customers' eyes. Sensing a winner, the family paid
$95,000 in franchise fees toward eight projected Arizona
franchises, spent $170,000 more to equip and open the first
one, and waited for the earnings to roll in.

   But instead of lapping up profits from ice cream, the
Stewarts now are licking their wounds. No longer in the
business, they say they are more than $1 million poorer. And
they're embroiled in a costly legal dispute with both
Integrated Resources Inc., the chain's former franchiser, and
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc., the current franchiser.
   Site selection errors, heavy debt and other factors may
have contributed to the Stewarts' failure, Mr. Stewart
concedes in an interview. But he also points a finger at the
chain's decision to sell factory-made ice cream.
   The case illustrates a common problem: Even a franchisee's
best-laid plans can go awry if a franchise promoter
unexpectedly reverses the very policies that attracted
investors. The case raises the question of what recourse the
franchisee has when the franchiser changes gears.
   "There's a gut-wrenching problem with franchisers that
have been around for a while," says Patrick J. Boroian,
president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia Fields, Ill.,
franchise-development and consulting firm. "They have to keep
remaking themselves, but often they must repudiate the things
that made them successful in the first place." Though
well-motivated, the reversals can conflict with the interests
or desires of entrenched franchisees, Mr. Boroian adds.
   In federal court in New York, the Stewarts face a lawsuit,
filed by Steve's Homemade, charging breach of contract and
trademark infringement. In their own lawsuit filed in the
same court, the Stewarts accuse Steve's Homemade -- and
Integrated as well -- of breach of contract and fraud. They
complain that Steve's Homemade, despite its name, began
requiring factorymade ice cream to be sold at new outlets.
The Stewarts contend that the switch was illegal, while the
franchisers argue the opposite.
   In January, U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo dismissed the fraud
charges against Steve's Homemade; the breach of contract
charges await trial. Meanwhile, the Stewarts have asked the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals to restore a portion of the
dismissed charges. In so doing, they have asked the court to
decide, in part, whether it is legal in New York state --
where both Integrated and Steve's Homemade are based -- for a
"successor franchiser" to break the original franchiser's
promises. All parties deny wrongdoing.
   "Our view is that this is a frivolous case," says Stephen
D. Weinroth, chairman of Integrated. The case against
Integrated has been stayed because the financial-services
company, for reasons unrelated to its former ice cream
business, last February filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Gary P. Stevens, vice chairman of Steve's Homemade,
declined to comment on the case. But in court papers, lawyers
for Steve's Homemade say the company honored franchise
agreements and committed no fraud. From a legal standpoint,
they add, the Stewarts' appeal is an unjustified attempt "to
convert a questionable contract action into a tort action."
   In a market glutted with look-alike stores that sold
factory-made ice cream, the original Steve's store, opened in
1973, became a sensation. Under founder Stephen Herrell,
Steve's made its own ice cream at its single location, in
Somerville, Mass. "People are interested in the local-hero
kind of thing where they know the ice-cream maker," says Mr.
Herrell, now president of Herrell's Ice Cream Corp., a
Northampton, Mass., operator and franchiser of ice-cream
stores. In addition, Steve's had appeal because of its
pioneering candy, fruit and nut "mix-ins."
   By 1984, after changing ownership twice, Steve's had begun
growing into a multi-regional chain. It then had about 15
franchises overseen by Integrated. Like other franchisees,
the Stewarts paid fees and royalties in return for using an
established business name and receiving help from the
franchiser.
   "It went very well initially," says Mr. Stewart. The
family's first outlet, near the University of Arizona in
Tucson, opened in November 1984 to brisk business, he
recalls. Steve's officials from Integrated paid visits, he
says, and pitched in with advertising materials and
promotional ideas.
   Though it urged the Stewarts to proceed with more stores,
Integrated reduced its support of the Tucson store and, it
turns out, quietly negotiated to quit the business, Mr.
Stewart says. In December 1985, only about five days after
the Stewarts opened a second store, Integrated sold the
assets of its Steve's Ice Cream operations to Steve's
Homemade. The new Lindenhurst, N.Y., company was headed by
investor Richard E. Smith, who already had interests in some
factory-made ice cream brands, such as Dolly Madison.
Integrated initially retained a 20% interest in Steve's
Homemade, but eventually sold it.
   Steve's Homemade has expanded the chain to about 100
Steve's franchises in the U.S. and 20 in Japan. It insisted
that new outlets use factory-made ice cream, the Stewarts
complain. This gave the franchiser a new source of income --
from supplying the product. The move also improved the
quality of Steve's ice cream and ensured "a uniform product
throughout the chain," says David M. Smith, Richard's son,
marketing vice president of Steve's Homemade. Many
franchisees, he adds, were happy to be freed from the demands
of making their own ice cream.
   But the change in franchisers came at the worst possible
time for the Stewarts. Their second store -- in Tempe, a
Phoenix suburb -- opened before the Stewarts had a franchise
agreement covering it. When the new franchiser sent the
contract, it called for factory-made ice cream. But the
Stewarts and a new partner say they had already invested
about $100,000 in the store, largely for equipment to make
ice cream.
   In a court deposition, Mr. Stewart says Steve's Homemade
advised him to keep the machines -- but only to maintain the
fiction that the store was making fresh ice cream. (The
company's Mr. Stevens declined to comment on this
allegation.)
   The family was also upset because Richard Smith planned to
sell factory-made Steve's Ice Cream in supermarkets. Steve's
outlets no longer enjoyed an exclusive on the brand name --
and, according to the Stewarts, now faced price competition
from low-margin supermarkets.
   On top of all that, the Stewarts say they were having
second thoughts about their obligation to develop eight
stores. Though brisk initially, sales at their first store
had slowed and weren't meeting projections. And sales at the
new Tempe store -- in a location that Mr. Stewart now says
was poor -- were even worse. The stores never became
profitable, the family says.
   Faced with all the problems, the Stewarts balked at
signing the new franchise agreement and began withholding
fees and royalties. Steve's Homemade then filed its lawsuit.
The Stewarts agreed to stop using the Steve's name, pending
the outcome of the litigation. They sold the Tempe store at a
loss in 1988. Last year, the Tucson store closed after the
city, in order to allow for a wider street, condemned the
building in which it was situated.
   Now the Stewarts hope to recover their losses in court,
while possibly setting a precedent that helps other
franchisees. Meanwhile, an amused Stephen Herrell notes how
much has changed at the chain that bears his first name. He
says, "If people want to see what the original Steve's was
like, they have to go to Herrell's."
