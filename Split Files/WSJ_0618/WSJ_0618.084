   NEW YORK -- In a move that reflects the extraordinary
value that courts and prosecutors place on cooperation by
defendants in securities fraud cases, former Wall Street
investment banker Martin A. Siegel was sentenced to two
months in prison for his crimes.
   In imposing the lenient sentence, U.S. District Judge
Robert J. Ward said that the two securities fraud-related
felony counts to which Mr. Siegel pleaded guilty in February
1987 were "serious." But Judge Ward added that Mr. Siegel's
"cooperation, his contrition and his candor under difficult
circumstances" prompted him to order a much lighter sentence
than many had expected. Mr. Siegel could have been sentenced
to as long as 10 years in prison.

   Judge Ward also noted that the government's position, put
forth in a sentencing memo released on Friday, was "not
typical." The government, in its memo and in court, praised
Mr. Siegel as a "credible and reliable" witness who
cooperated despite "an intense campaign of villification."
The government said the assistance of the 42-year-old Mr.
Siegel enabled prosecutors to learn about wrongdoing they
would not otherwise have uncovered.
   The sentencing of Mr. Siegel, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.'s
former chief takeover strategist, ended a saga that began on
Nov. 14, 1986, when a federal marshal thrust a subpoena into
Mr. Siegel's hands relating to his dealings with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator. Mr. Boesky's
cooperation, which began the insider trading investigation,
led the government to Mr. Siegel.
   Mr. Siegel began cooperating with the government and
eventually pleaded guilty to exchanging insider information
with Mr. Boesky and with Robert M. Freeman, the former head
of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Mr. Siegel also paid
more than $9 million in fines.
   Mr. Siegel's cooperation proved a bonanza for the
government. The Kidder unit agreed in June 1987 to pay $25.3
million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges
in connection with Mr. Siegel's actions. The government also
disclosed for the first time in its sentencing memo that
leads provided by Mr. Siegel resulted in the conviction last
year of five officials of Princeton/Newport Partners and a
former Drexel trader on racketeering and other charges.
   Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty last August to one felony
count. Mr. Freeman, who had long denied that he had done
anything wrong, admitted to using inside information received
from Mr. Siegel in connection with the proposed takeover of
Beatrice Cos. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. In April, Mr.
Freeman was sentenced to four months in jail.
   The government has said the crime to which Mr. Freeman
pleaded guilty was one of many he committed. But until
Friday, the government hadn't elaborated on Mr. Freeman's
other alleged misdeeds. In its memo, the government said that
beginning in 1984, Messrs. Freeman and Siegel passed inside
information to each other about companies involved in "at
least twelve takeover situations."
   The government also said that Mr. Siegel provided credible
information about a 1985 telephone call in which Mr. Siegel
received a tip from Mr. Freeman about Unocal Corp. Mr. Siegel
then ordered Kidder traders to buy securities based on that
tip. The government said in the memo that it also seized a
tape from Princeton/Newport on which Mr. Freeman is heard
giving that defunct firm similar information about Unocal.
   On Friday, Mr. Freeman's attorneys continued to deny that
he had engaged in further wrongdoing. "Mr. Freeman has taken
and passed a lie detector test on his statements that no
illicit arrangement with Siegel ever existed and that he
never deliberately gave Siegel confidential information to
help Siegel make a trading decision," the attorneys, Paul
Curran and Robert Fiske Jr., said in a statement.
   According to individuals familiar with the drafting of the
government's memo, Messrs. Curran and Fiske successfully
sought to block the government from including more details
about Mr. Freeman's actions. Those details were included in a
probation report that was not made public. Mr. Curran
declined to comment.
   Mr. Siegel had accepted $700,000 in cash payments from Mr.
Boesky in 1983 and 1984 in exchange for information he
provided to Mr. Boesky. Judge Ward noted that the profits of
Mr. Boesky, who recently completed a three-year prison term,
totaled $30 million.
   "After Mr. Boesky received a three-year sentence {in
1987}, I began to think about Mr. Siegel," Judge Ward said.
"At that time, I was of the view that" a prison term of "18
months to two years would be reasonable" for Mr. Siegel.
   Judge Ward said that in the "intervening period, I was
advised that the government wished to defer Mr. Siegel's
sentence because of his cooperation." Largely because of that
cooperation, Judge Ward decided that Mr. Siegel should serve
"a sentence less than imposed on Mr. Freeman," who has
refused to cooperate with the government.
   Legal experts say that Judge Ward is likely to be attacked
for the lenient sentence. Jed Rakoff, an attorney for Mr.
Siegel, said: "The sentence was fair and just and reflected
very well on the degree to which Judge Ward immersed himself
in the particulars of the case."
   Mr. Siegel was also sentenced to five years probation and
ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service in
Jacksonville, Fla., near his home. He is to begin serving the
sentence on July 16.
