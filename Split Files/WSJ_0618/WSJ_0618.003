   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc., continuing its effort to
ease back into the personal computer market after an absence
of nearly a decade, will today introduce its entry into the
crowded field of so-called "notebook" personal computers.
   The TravelMate 2000, to be introduced at the annual PC
Expo trade show in New York, is a 4.4-pound notebook-sized
laptop computer that measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches and is
just 1.4 inches thick. The machine runs on an Intel 80C286
microprocessor, has a 20 megabyte hard disk drive, has a
rechargeable, nickel cadmium battery that will run for two
hours, an optional battery pack that will extend operating
time to five hours, and will retail at $3,999.

   Having survived a disastrous plunge into the personal
computer market in the early 1980s, Texas Instruments
returned to the business last fall with three laptop
computers. But those machines were market followers. With the
TravelMate 2000, which the company claims is the thinnest and
lightest of the notebooks that run on the 286 chips, Texas
Instruments hopes to get a leadership position.
   But it won't be easy to gain or maintain a leading
position in the competitive new market for notebooks. The
field has gotten crowded with formidable competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp. and NEC Corp. And the technology is
advancing rapidly.
   Also to be unveiled at PC Expo, for example, is a notebook
designed by Airis Computer Corp. that weighs 6.5 pounds, runs
an Intel 80C286 microprocessor and has a 20-megabyte hard
disk drive. But the Airis machine runs on C batteries, rather
than the heavy and expensive rechargeable batteries now in
general use, and will retail for only $1,899 -- roughly half
of what Texas Instruments, Compaq Computer Corp. and
virtually every other manufacturer is charging for a
comparable machine. Some analysts, however, question whether
the Chicago-based start-up company will have the resources to
mass produce the machine in a reasonable amount of time.
   Faced with such formidable competition and chastened by
its earlier failure, Texas Instruments is trying to share the
risks and costs with other computer resellers. The company
manufactures a virtually identical machine that was recently
introduced by Sharp Corp.
   The machine being introduced today will be marketed under
the Texas Instruments label. But unlike many of the competing
notebooks, the TravelMate is being targeted primarily for
business users and won't generally be available at
consumer-oriented retail stores.
