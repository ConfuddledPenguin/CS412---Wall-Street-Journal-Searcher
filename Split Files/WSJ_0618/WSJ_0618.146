   EAST GERMANY CONSIDERED immediate unification with the
West.
   In a move underscoring the nation's political volatility,
East German lawmakers debated a proposal to simply dissolve
the country and merge with West Germany. But after pleas of
moderation from East German leader de Maiziere, they referred
the issue to a committee. The premier argued there were many
questions to be sorted out. West German Chancellor Kohl, who
attended the session in East Berlin, said the Germanys
settled on wording for a declaration guaranteeing Poland's
western border.

   LITHUANIA IS TO VOTE on a plan to break an impasse with
the Kremlin.
   Legislators in Vilnius were expected to vote, possibly as
early as tomorrow, on a moratorium on the Baltic republic's
March 11 independence proclamation in an attempt to break a
deadlock with Moscow. But a senior official said he doubted
the Parliament would approve the compromise. In Moscow,
progressive lawmakers in the Communist Party announced that
they would walk out of a party congress that is to start in
two weeks, setting the stage for the first split in the
ruling party in 68 years.
   The mainstream party group in Moscow published a
pre-congress platform criticizing leaders for drifting into
"an ideological and organizational crisis."

first round of voting was last Sunday.

new interior minister offered to start a dialogue.

defense policy.

partisan political activity.

much popular support because of an economic crisis.
