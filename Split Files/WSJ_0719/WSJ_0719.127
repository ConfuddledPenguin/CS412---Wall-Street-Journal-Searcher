   NEW YORK -- The board of the Commodity Exchange Inc., as
expected, named David A. Halperin its new president.
   Mr. Halperin, 47 years old, had been executive vice
president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a post he
occupied since December 1989. He came to the Merc from the
Comex, where he had been employed for eight years. His last
post at the Comex was executive vice president responsible
for economics and research, new product development,
operations and computer systems. Mr. Halperin moved to the
Merc last year as part of a reorganization plan.

   "I feel very fortunate to have been able to work at the
highest level of policy development and operations" at both
Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange, "which has given
me insight into the needs of both exchanges," he said.
   Martin Greenberg, Comex chairman, said, "His (Mr.
Halperin's) professional experience with our organization and
his industry insight make him the perfect man for the job."
   One former exchange official says he thinks Mr. Halperin
will do well at the Comex because "he knows where all the
bodies are buried."
