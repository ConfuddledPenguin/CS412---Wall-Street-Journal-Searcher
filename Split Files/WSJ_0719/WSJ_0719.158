   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade modified their "circuit breaker" trading halts
that would be activated by sharp one-day swings in stock and
stock-index futures prices.
   The revisions were made in accordance with recent
recommendations from a New York Stock Exchange panel on
market volatility, and have been submitted to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for approval. The changes are
conditional on their acceptance by the Big Board and other
stock and stock options exchanges, the Chicago futures
exchanges said.

   Wild price swings in stock-index futures prices were
blamed by many for worsening the slide in stock prices during
the October 1987 stock market crash and last October's
mini-crash. Futures industry officials generally reject that
notion, but have acceded to circuit breakers and other
restrictions to avoid more onerous oversight from federal
regulators.
   Trading would be halted for one to two hours in Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading at the Merc each time
the S&amp;P 500 contract moved up or down 12, 24, 36 and 44 index
points. The Merc's current circuit breakers are triggered
when the S&amp;P 500 contract moves 12 and 20 points. A
five-point price limit during the opening minutes of trading
will remain in effect.
   The Board of Trade revised circuit breakers for its Major
Market Index of 20 blue-chip stocks to take effect at swings
of 20, 40, 60 and 80 index points. The exchange's existing
circuit breakers take effect at downward moves of 20, 30 and
50 index points, and as a result of an upward spike of 50
index points.
   The stock-index future circuit breakers correspond with
moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 100, 200, 300
and 400 points.
