   AMR Corp. said second-quarter earnings plunged 27% because
of soft traffic and higher costs at its American Airlines
unit, a harbinger of things to come for the industry.
   Net income for the company, based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell to $129.2 million, or $2.05 a share, compared with
$177.9 million, or $2.83 a share, a year earlier. Revenue,
however, was up 9.5%, to $2.97 billion from $2.72 billion.

   In a statement, AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall attributed
the lower earnings to rising costs, such as for fuel,
maintenance and facilities rentals, while "domestic traffic
is weaker than we had hoped it would be."
   In addition, the airline restructured its European routes
and incurred start-up costs associated with its acquisition
of Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines.
   As the pacesetter for the airline industry, American
usually reports larger profits and narrower losses than its
rivals. Most airline stocks fell yesterday after AMR released
its results. AMR's stock fell $2.875 to $61.625 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   First-half earnings fell 60.6%, to $109.9 million, or
$1.75 a share, from $278.9 million, or $4.43 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 9.6%, to $5.66 billion from $5.16
billion.
   Industry analyst Timothy Pettee of Merrill Lynch said most
airlines will report results along the same lines. "It's the
bellwether airline, so when its operating earnings are down
20%, the industry's is likely to be down 20% to 30%."
   In the most recent quarter, the villain was excess
capacity, said analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody.
"You have too many seats chasing too few people," he said.
   Separately, American said it would acquire two new Boeing
Co. 747-400s from Canadian Airlines International for $330
million. The airline, which is expanding its international
service at a fast clip, has been seeking to acquire the
wide-body jets for some time.
   The agreement also includes the purchase of four General
Electric Co. CF680C2B1F engines for each of the jets, and
spare parts. American said the purchase is contingent upon
securing authority from the Department of Transportation's
chief administrative law judge to fly a Chicago-Tokyo route;
American has already received preliminary approval from the
department.
