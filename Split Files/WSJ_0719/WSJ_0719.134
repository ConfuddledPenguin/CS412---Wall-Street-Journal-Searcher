   Tokyo stocks finished lower as growing expectations for
higher domestic interest rates increased a wait-and-see mood
in the afternoon session, traders said.
   In London, shares ended near intraday lows in relatively
active trading, pressured by sagging Wall Street share
prices.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues, which had advanced for
five consecutive trading days, fell back 124.17 points to
33048.11.
   The index, a 150.55-point gainer Tuesday, fell as low as
32971 at midafternoon Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei eased 67.77
points to 32980.34.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, down slightly from 628 million shares
Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 505-446, while 176
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 9.53 points, or 0.40%, to 2397.78.
   The second section index dropped 29.42 points, or 0.66%,
to 4402.08. Volume in the section was estimated at 22 million
shares, down from 23.8 million shares Tuesday.
   Discouraging the market was speculation on the bond market
that the Bank of Japan wants to push up both long-term and
short-term interest rates.
   "It was a blow to investors who were just ready to come
out to the trading floor," said Shigeru Akiba, head of equity
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   After the federal fund rate reduction by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Friday, expectation grew Monday that Japanese
interest rates, if not falling, at least may not rise higher.
   Such expectations were about to bring institutions off the
sidelines, Mr. Akiba said. "But now they are unable to move"
out of fear of higher interest rates, he said.
   Kimitoshi Hasegawa, head of group pension management at
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, said continuing high interest rates
despite the yen's strength lead to a consensus among
investors that the overall funds invested on stocks won't
increase. Therefore, strong gains for large-capital domestic
demand-related shares are least expected.
   Fund managers are more and more focused on small-capital
shares with strong earnings predictions, he said.
   Traders said that although the market lacked strength to
push up stock prices, the sentiment wasn't too bearish.
Buying orders constantly placed at lower levels prevented
stocks from plunging.
   Public spending-related shares advanced, helped by buying
by the Big Four brokerage houses.
   Nippon Hodo rose 50 yen to 3,830 yen (34 cents to $25.90).
Taisei gained 10 to 1,330, while Ohbayashi was up 20 at
1,700.
   Stocks that appeared to be targets of buying by some
speculator groups rose strongly, traders said. Among these
were Jujo Paper, which advanced 100 to 970, and Kurabo, which
gained 80 to 1,150.
   Pharmaceutical shares advanced, with Sankyo up 70 to 2,710
and Ono gaining 50 to 5,900.
   High-technology shares finished generally lower as
investors took profits after recent gains, traders said. Sony
was down 80 at 8,900, while Kyocera fell 170 to 8,970 yen.
Fanuc fell 50 to 7,500.
   The London market opened higher but rapidly lost ground on
expectations of a lower Wall Street because of an anticipated
inflationary U.S. consumer price report for June. Those fears
came true, with the data showing a rise of 0.5%, compared
with the consensus forecast of 0.3%.
   However, traders said some of London's losses could be
ascribed to profit-taking after the recent rally. Overall,
sentiment remains optimistic, with "people looking for buy
ideas rather than sell ideas," one dealer said. "People are
using bad news to pick up cheap stock."
   Also affecting prices was sterling's new highs compared
with the dollar and several European currencies. The rise put
pressure on overseas earners.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index dropped
13 points to 2402. The intraday high of 2424.8 was reached in
the midmorning. The Financial Times 30-Share Index closed off
12.3 points at 1900.6.
   Volume was a reasonably robust 595.2 million issues,
compared with 374.9 million Tuesday, even after taking into
account the placing of 54 million British Gas shares.
   These shares represent a line of reserved stock offered as
a bonus to holders but not all taken up. British Gas was off
a penny at 222 pence ($4.03).
   British Steel's announcement that it had agreed in
principle to acquire 40% of Spain's Aristrain for an
undisclosed sum was unsurprising and therefore had little
effect on the company's share price. The stock ended
unchanged at 142 1/2 pence.
   British Aerospace was down 5 at 550. However, dealers said
the shares were hit by the falling market, as the news was
largely discounted in the price because the government move
was disclosed several weeks ago.
   Among overseas earners to be hit by the pound's strength,
ICI dropped 9 to #11.56, Glaxo shed 22 to 853, and B.A.T fell
8 to 963. Reuters dropped 17 to #12.65, and Wellcome finished
at 580, off 13.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt
and Milan, mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam, and lower in
Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed lower.
   Meanwhile, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Manila
and Taipei, mixed in Wellington, and higher in Hong Kong and
Seoul.
