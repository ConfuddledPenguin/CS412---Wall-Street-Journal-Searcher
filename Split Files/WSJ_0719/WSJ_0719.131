   ATLANTA -- Georgia Gulf Corp., in its first earnings
report since it recapitalized to thwart an unwanted takeover,
said second-quarter net income plunged 68% on a 25% drop in
sales.
   The chemical company reported net income of $15.7 million,
or 50 cents a share, compared with $49.3 million, or $1.91 a
share, a year earlier. The latest results reflected
recapitalization costs, including such items as legal fees,
of about $15.2 million. The quarter's earnings also included
$16.9 million in interest expense related to the
recapitalization.

   Georgia Gulf adopted the recapitalization plan in April,
ending a protracted and bitter takeover battle with Dallas
investor Harold C. Simmons.
   Sales dropped to $218.7 million from $292.3 million.
Georgia Gulf attributed the decrease largely to the recent
sale of its Freeman Chemical Corp. subsidiary.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
exchange yesterday, Georgia Gulf fell 12.5 cents to close at
$10.375. The company released its earnings after the market
closed.
   For the first half, earnings fell 49% to $53.1 million, or
$1.90 a share, from $104.7 million, or $4.04 a share, a year
earlier. Sales dropped 23% to $470.4 million from $610
million. "Considering that in the first six months of last
year the chemical industry experienced some of its strongest
markets ever, the current level of earnings, while down,
represents a good performance," a company news release said.
