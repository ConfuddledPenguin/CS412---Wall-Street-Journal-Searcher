   NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. directors approved
the establishment of a leveraged employee stock ownership
plan valued at $140 million.
   The investment banking firm said it will fund the ESOP
through a loan to an independently managed trust, which will
purchase a new issue of convertible preferred stock from the
company. The ESOP is being established to broaden internal
ownership in the firm and to provide benefits to its
employees in a cost-effective manner, the company said.
