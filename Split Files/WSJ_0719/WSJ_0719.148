   I am a Goddess worshiper who read your June 7 page-one
article "Is Goddess Worship Finally Going to Put Men in Their
Place?" As you say, Goddess worship is not anti-men or
anti-male. But your overall emphasis and tone contradict that
statement. Many (if not most) branches of Goddess worship
include a male deity and stress love and understanding
between the sexes. My personal experience is of a roughly
equal number of men and women who participate; the men are
not wimps and the women are not bitches.
   Some rituals and services in Goddess worship are designed
to let go of things that hold us back from our full human
potential and they may seem peculiar to those not familiar
with Goddess worship. You made almost no mention of the
reverence for nature, the acknowledgment of both female and
male energies in life, and the fulfillment for human
potential that truly make up Goddess worship as we know it
today.

   Shame on you for your patronizing and superficial article
about Goddess worshipers. I suppose if you went to a
Christian church, you would tell of a cannibalistic death
cult (referring to its practice of communion and the
crucifixes adorning church walls and worshipers' necks).
   Although you did touch on one of our basic beliefs -- that
all life is interconnected and that we strive for harmony
between all life on earth -- you failed to report how this is
related to our rituals, thus trivializing them. You also buy
into mainstream culture's "war between the sexes" when you
attempt to pit the men's spirituality movement against the
womens's.
   Most of us are working for a new kind of partnership
between women and men in which each is honored and respected.
Honor and respect are the last things present when women
treat men as success objects and men treat women as sex
objects. A lot of healing and relearning will have to happen
to overcome thousands of years of dominator/manipulator
culture.

   Your article reflected the patronization of women by the
establishment that we are trying to combat. The women
portrayed (all of whom took some other name, as if playing
make-believe) are shown as "giggling," primal screaming
man-haters.
   I do not use an alias, and I take my religion seriously.
This includes laughing and dancing and a sense of humor not
portrayed in your article. I do not worship on Groundhog Day,
but on Imbolc, the eve of February.

   A prehistoric, Goddess-centered culture has now been
described, marked by egalitarianism (not woman-dominance),
nurturing and focus on life-giving rather than life-taking.
   The overthrow and subsequent attempts at revival of that
nonviolent culture are a valuable part of this Goddess
scholarship. Dynamics between dominating forces vs.
equalizing/nurturing forces are presented as a useful tool
for the study of history and current events.
   I must confess that the religion and ritual of Goddess
culture do little for me; but the scholarship associated with
an ancient history too long obscured from our view may shed a
valuable, hope-rekindling light on the human condition. We
could use it.

   The laws and the national social philosophy of this
country are based on the Judeo-Christian tradition.
   In that religious tradition, the First Commandment refers
to one true God: "I am the Lord, thy God; thou shalt not have
strange gods before Me."
   The Bible is full of terrible, historical events, which
resulted in the collective spiritual judgments on the Jewish
and Christian peoples because of their worship of false gods.
