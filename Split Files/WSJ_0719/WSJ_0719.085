   HONG KONG -- Confronted with rising claims by foreign
banks, the Chinese government is dragging its feet in
honoring loan guarantees issued by troubled state
enterprises.
   Many state-owned concerns, squeezed for cash by an
austerity program implemented in late 1988, have defaulted on
their loan guarantees. Foreign banks stung by the defaults
have aired their grievances with the guarantors' parent
organizations at the provincial and central government
levels. But no one is willing to accept responsibility for
the bad debts.

   Some Chinese officials say the guarantees are invalid,
having been issued without central government approval.
Others wash their hands of the matter, saying that under
revisions of recent years, Chinese enterprises are
responsible for their own profits and losses. Those few who
acknowledge that the government is obliged to repay bad loans
say the money should come from anywhere but their own agency.
   More generally, as the number of disputes between foreign
banks and Chinese agencies grows, China's international
financial standing is being affected.
   "Every bank world-wide is watching to see if Beijing will
assume eventual responsibility for these loan defaults," a
foreign banker with exposure to several China loan defaults
says. "We would go from the city government to the provincial
government and all the way to {Premier} Li Peng's office. If
the premier says it's not his problem, fine: Lending to China
would be an entirely new ball game."
   Because most China loan agreements specify the application
of Hong Kong law, an increasing number of foreign banks are
seeking repayment from their Chinese guarantors through the
British colony's courts. To their chagrin, many bankers have
found that Hong Kong court decisions are practically
unenforceable in China.
   "When the first loan documents were written, nobody
actually knew what went into a dispute," says Michael Moser,
a U.S. lawyer who specializes in China. And a Japanese banker
says, "Everybody was running a high fever" in the early
1980s, when most of the loans that now are problems were
signed.
   Of China's total foreign debt of $41.3 billion at the end
of 1989, $5 billion was covered by government guarantees, and
an additional $1.3 billion was guaranteed by foreign-invested
joint ventures. The People's Bank of China, the central bank,
recently released the debt breakdown to the World Bank to
dispel rumors about the country's financial health, says a
foreign banker with access to the data.
   But bankers say government-guaranteed obligations far
exceed $5 billion, because many guarantees were issued in the
early 1980s, before regulations went into effect that
required registration of loan guarantees with the central
government.
   The repayment records of central government institutions,
such as Bank of China and China International Trust &amp;
Investment Corp., remain impeccable, as are those of many
local guarantors, such as the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone
Development Corp., which paid promptly when called upon by a
bank syndicate led by Lloyds Bank PLC of Britain.
Furthermore, a sharp drop in imports has bolstered China's
foreign-exchange reserves, increasing government agencies'
ability to service their debts.
   But all of this brings little comfort to the foreign
creditors of Guangdong Overseas Chinese Enterprises Co., for
example. The large land-owning concern failed to honor its
multimillion-dollar guarantees when called upon by Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Bank PLC, First
National Bank of Chicago and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
   In the early 1980s, Guangdong Overseas was among foreign
banks' most favored customers. It came under the powerful
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, which has ministerial
ranking and substantial foreign-exchange revenue from its
China Travel Services unit.
   Such factors are crucial in China, where conventional
methods for assessing creditworthiness don't apply: Many
foreign banks lent to projects and enterprises on the
strength of their guarantors, which were graded in accordance
with their political leverage. For example, if the parent of
a guarantor could be traced to the State Council, the loan
was considered nearly as safe as sovereign debt.
   "To a certain degree, our lending hinged on the degree of
central and provincial support on the project," says a
creditor whose bank lent to projects guaranteed by Guangdong
Overseas. When several of the projects flopped, the bank
called upon Guangdong Overseas, which said it hadn't any
money to honor its guarantees. The bank then turned to the
guarantor's Beijing parent, only to discover that Guangdong
Overseas had undergone a restructuring that severed its ties
to the central government and placed it under the Guangdong
Agricultural Commission.
