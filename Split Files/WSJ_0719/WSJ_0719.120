   The Bush administration, abandoning its failed Cambodia
policy, said it will hold talks with the U.S.'s old enemy
Vietnam to try to revitalize the Cambodia peace effort.
   Secretary of State James Baker, speaking to reporters in
Paris, said the administration will begin talking with
Vietnam to try to prevent the murderous Khmer Rouge
guerrillas from again taking over Cambodia. As part of its
policy shift, the U.S. won't any longer back the awarding of
Cambodia's United Nations seat to a three-party coalition
that includes two non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge.
The U.S. also plans to loosen restrictions on
humanitarian-aid projects for Vietnam and for Cambodia, which
is dominated by Vietnam.

   The diplomatic shift reflects growing congressional and
international concerns that the U.S. policy inadvertently
might have been aiding the Khmer Rouge. "It's very important
to do what we can to prevent a return to power of the Khmer
Rouge," Mr. Baker said.
   A senior U.S. official in Washington said the talks with
Vietnam will be at the same diplomatic level as discussions
under way over locating and returning the remains of U.S.
soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. Top administration
officials, including Vice President Dan Quayle, have
emphasized recently that if Vietnam cooperates on that issue
and the Cambodian peace issue, normal diplomatic relations
could follow. The senior U.S. official said that the
administration would consider talking to Cambodia's Communist
regime if that would advance the process of holding free
elections in Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge
regime, which slaughtered about one million people in
Cambodia. After it occupied Cambodia, Vietnam set up a puppet
regime there. The U.S. has been backing non-Communist forces,
led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, that are fighting Cambodia's
government.
   Over the past decade, Vietnam was viewed by U.S. policy
makers as a client of the Soviet Union, and U.S. policy
toward Asia was driven by the goal of blocking Soviet
expansionism. This included supporting the insurgents who
were battling against the regime installed in Cambodia by
Hanoi.
   The end of the Cold War is altering this view. The senior
U.S. official said that although the Soviets continue to
supply Vietnam and Cambodia, "it's clear they are prepared to
engage in dialogue on regional issues." Mr. Baker announced
the new policy in Paris after explaining it to Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at a meeting.
   But recent battlefield successes by the Khmer Rouge,
combined with its stalling tactics at the negotiating table,
set off alarm bells in the U.S. Last month, the Senate
Intelligence Committee voted to cut off covert assistance to
the non-Communist forces because of concern over the
administration's policy and fear that some of the aid was
going to the Khmer Rouge. And the House approved $7 million
in non-lethal aid to non-Communist forces only after imposing
restrictions in response to criticism that those forces were
mounting operations in cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.
   This month, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine), with GOP support, drafted a letter calling on the
administration to "re-examine that policy." The letter, which
is circulating in the Senate, urged the administration to end
U.S. support at the U.N. for any Cambodian forces that
include the Khmer Rouge and to base its policy on preventing
that group from returning to power.
   In a statement, Sen. Mitchell welcomed the policy changes
but said they didn't go far enough in "clearly and
effectively preventing future Khmer Rouge domination of
Cambodia." He urged the administration to start talking with
the regime in Cambodia and to exert pressure on China, the
key backer of the Khmer Rouge. President Bush has resisted
calls for stiff penalties to influence China's behavior,
claiming such measures are counterproductive.
   It would be difficult in any event for Mr. Bush to change
China's policy. China believes that its long-term interests
in Southeast Asia are best served by protecting smaller
states against Vietnamese aggression. Thus, it aids the Khmer
Rouge against the Cambodian regime installed by Hanoi.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said the
administration's new approach "should help solidify support
on Capitol Hill for assistance to the non-Communist
resistance."
   The senior U.S. official who briefed reporters in
Washington yesterday said that "we stand strongly behind"
requests for aid to the non-Communist insurgents. He
underscored that the administration was withdrawing its
support for the coalition at the U.N. only because it
included the Khmer Rouge and wouldn't support Cambodia's
Vietnam-backed leader for the seat.
   It isn't clear how the shift in U.S. policy will lead to a
breakthrough at the peace table. The U.S. hasn't yet
determined specifically what it will ask Vietnam to do once
the talks begin, nor is it clear it can persuade China to be
more cooperative. And the policy assumes a continuing
military stalemate in Cambodia. However, the Khmer Rouge,
taking advantage of the rainy season, which favors mobile
guerrilla groups over heavily equipped government units,
appears to have scored a string of recent military successes.
   The policy shift may anger some congressional Republicans.
Mr. Baker said the administration felt free to open the
dialogue with Hanoi because the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia, the original U.S. policy goal, has been
accomplished. The senior U.S. official in Washington said
that all combat troops have been removed and that there were
no more than 10,000 Vietnamese military advisers left in
Cambodia.
   But the House GOP task force on terrorism and
unconventional warfare, in a report in April, said that
Vietnam has "re-invaded" Cambodia and has about 65,000 troops
there. In an interview yesterday, Vaughn Forrest, the group's
chief of staff, said: "The withdrawal is incomplete at best.
That doesn't signal to me that there's a government there
dealing forthrightly."
