   MCI Communications, which came under pressure Tuesday
after competitor United Telecommunications's US Sprint unit
reported a huge loss, fell further yesterday even though its
second-quarter income was at the high end of analysts
expectations. The stock lost 1 7/8 to 36 1/2.
   Intel, which reported strong second-quarter results
Tuesday, came under further selling pressure yesterday,
dropping 2 points to 48 1/2.
   "I've never seen a market go from euphoria to complete
pessimism in such a short amount of time," says Jim
Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco.
   The selling sent the Nasdaq Composite Index careening 3.66
points for a 0.8%-drop to 460.82. The New York Stock Exchange
didn't fare any better, with the composite index there losing
0.83%
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 791 to 1,107. Volume
eased to 159 million shares from Tuesday's 167.8 million
shares.
   Hambrecht &amp; Quist's Mr. Tarrantino says the profit-taking
has been orderly. But analysts and investors are franticaly
reassessing outlooks for many of the OTC market's largest
companies.
   MCI Communications reported profit of 67 cents a share in
the latest second quarter, up from 56 cents a year ago. That
was at the high end of the range of 64 cents to 68 cents a
share estimated by analysts.
   But MCI's stock fell yesterday on concerns that revenue
growth from the first quarter was not as robust as some
investors had hoped. The second quarter's $1.86 billion in
revenue was up about 3% from the first quarter.
   PaineWebber telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman says
the revenues were about $40 million below what he had hoped
for, adding that many people were looking for 5% growth in
revenue from the first quarter.
   "People are worried about the longterm growth rate," Mr.
Grubman says. He adds that both MCI and US Sprint are losing
market share to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in the
high-margin general business market. Mr. Grubman hasn't
changed his rating on the stock or estimates for the
company's future earnings.
   "The stock market isn't being driven by Wall Street
analysts, but by investors who are beginning to worry about
the revenues," the PaineWebber analyst says.
   Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Rajiv
Chaudhri removed Intel from the firm's "focus list" of stocks
that are attractive on the short-term basis.
   Mr. Chaudhri says this stock remains on Goldman's
"recommended for purchase list" for long-term oriented
investors. But he says the company's microprocessor revenue
is slowing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, while analysts'
earnings estimates continue to rise. That means Intel is less
likely to do much more than meet analysts estimates in the
near future, Mr. Chaudhri says.
   Lotus Development sank 2 7/8 to 31 1/4 despite reporting
that its profit surged to 54 cents a share in the latest
second quarter from 25 cents a year earlier. But the company
told analysts at a meeting later in the day that it thinks
Wall Street's third quarter earnings estimates are too high.
   Apple Computer was a rare winner among the big OTC
technology stocks yesterday. The computer maker's stock rose
3/8 to 44 5/8 in anticipation of its third quarter earnings
report, released after the market closed. Apple reported that
it earned 96 cents a share in the quarter, compared to 74
cents a year earlier. But Apple cautioned that its operating
earnings for the fourth quarter may not match those posted a
year earlier. For the fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, 1989,
Apple reported profit of $161 million, or $1.24 a share,
which included a gain of $8 million, or 37 cents a share,
from the sale of Apple's stake in Adobe Systems.
   Hambrecht &amp; Quist computer analyst Bruce Lupatkin said
Apple "painted a pretty dismal picture" in a conference call
with analysts late yesterday. The company told analysts it is
in a "transitional period" that is likely to continue through
the first half on fiscal 1991, Mr. Lupatkin said.
   Cetus fell 1 1/4 to 17 1/2 on volume of more than 3
million shares. The company has announced that it had
temporarily stopped testing of Proleukin as a potential
hypertension drug, citing difficulty in replicating results
from animal testing. The drug is currently pending approval
by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment
of kidney cancer. An FDA advisory committee panel will hear a
presentation on the drug at the end of July.
   American Ecology rose 2 3/4 to 8 1/4 after it reported
second quarter profit of 57 cents a share, compared with a
loss from continuing operations of 11 cents a share a year
ago. The company's revenue rose to $14.7 million from $9.6
million.
