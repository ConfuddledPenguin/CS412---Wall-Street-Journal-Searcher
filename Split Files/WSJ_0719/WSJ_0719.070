   House Republicans have sent a message to both the White
House and the Democrats that a budget-summit deal that
includes any new taxes won't have their support. Yesterday,
by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, they passed a resolution by
Texas Rep. Dick Armey opposing the use of "new taxes, and all
tax rate increases" to reduce the deficit. To make sure
everyone can read their lips, they defined tax rate increases
as "all rates on all existing taxes under federal
jurisdiction." The Armey resolution makes it difficult to
pass another TEFRA-like sham budget agreement. With a
majority of House Republicans on record against higher taxes,
Democrats may have to give up more than they bargained for on
budget-process reform and spending if they want an agreement.
