   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation giving the
Securities and Exchange Commission far broader enforcement
powers, including expanding the agency's fining authority
beyond insider trading for the first time.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, also would allow the
agency to police corporate America more actively. That area
had been somewhat de-emphasized in recent years as the SEC
focused on Wall Street insider-trading cases. One provision
would grant the SEC authority to ask a federal court to bar
an officer or director from serving at a public company if
that person violates securities law and "demonstrates
substantial unfitness to serve."

   Moreover, the legislation would grant the SEC
"cease-and-desist authority" to block allegedly fraudulent
investment activity from continuing.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), chairman of the
securities subcommittee, said the bill "sends a strong
message to would-be law violators that they will be detected
and prosecuted with remedies that fit the crime."
   Some securities lawyers, however, worry that the agency is
being granted more power than it needs to police the markets
adequately. For example, Theodore Levine, a Washington
securities lawyer, expressed concern in a letter to clients
that "neither the House nor the Senate have addressed the
fact that the SEC has produced absolutely no evidence" that
it needs cease-and-desist authority to supplement traditional
court action.
   The bill was first proposed by the SEC in 1988 to fill
what it perceived as holes in its enforcement program. For
example, SEC officials had complained that they can either
slap the wrists of offenders by simply requiring them to
promise not to repeat an illegal act, or they can bar them
from the business. That didn't leave much ability to punish
medium-sized violations such as failure to file disclosures,
the agency argued.
   The bill would allow the agency to fine securities-law
violators on a tiered system, with maximums of $500,000 for
corporations and $100,000 for individuals.
   The measure is awaiting floor approval in the House.
Energy and Commerce Committee staff members expect the bill
to pass easily in a vote scheduled for Monday. The House bill
generally matches the Senate legislation, although it doesn't
have tiers for fines, and it has tighter procedural rules for
the cease-and-desist authority.
