   NEW YORK -- Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan, a joint venture
between PepsiCo Inc. and Mitsubishi Corp., is expected to be
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's second section Aug. 21,
said Hidemi Suzuki, executive vice president of corporate
finance at Nikko Securities International Inc.
   Nikko Securities International's parent, Nikko Securities
Co. Ltd., is the lead manager for the planned, initial public
offering of six million shares of KFC Japan. Suzuki confirmed
that the offering price range of between 6,510 yen and 8,470
yen "is the one Nikko Tokyo is going to use." At the current
exchange rate of 148 yen to the dollar, that equals a range
of about $44 to $57.

   Suzuki said that U.S. law bars U.S. residents or
institutions from buying new Japanese issues. However,
Japanese branches of U.S. securities firms and foreign
brokerages are allowed to participate.
   Pepsi and Mitsubishi each currently own 48.7% of KFC
Japan's 15.75 million shares, and the balance is held by an
employee stock-ownership plan.
