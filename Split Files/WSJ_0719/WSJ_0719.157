   LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued Dataproducts Corp. and
its chief executive officer, Jack C. Davis, for allegedly
issuing false and misleading positive statements about the
company before its stock took a tumble last September.
   The drop in the stock price, to $9.50 a share on Sept. 8
from as high as $13.875 in August, came after Dataproducts
announced a restructuring that resulted in a one-time charge
of $45 million. That move came as Dataproducts sought to
resist a hostile bid from DPC Acquisition Corp., a New York
investment group led by Crescott Investment Associates. This
year, Dataproducts was acquired by a venture formed by two
affiliates of Hitachi Ltd., the Tokyo-based electronic
equipment maker, for about $160 million.

   Nadeem Faruqi, a purchaser of 100 Dataproducts shares,
said in his lawsuit filed in federal court here that the
misleading statements began May 3, 1988, with a news release
calling "solid ink technology" the future of office printing,
when the company knew it was facing technical and marketing
difficulties.
   The Woodland Hills, Calif., maker of computer printers and
other data handling equipment also covered up problems with
its SI 480 printer and airline ticket printing products, the
suit charges.
   Mr. Davis said yesterday that he hadn't seen the suit and
thus couldn't comment on it.
   The suit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of
those who purchased stock between May 3, 1988, and Sept. 7,
1989, seeks unspecified damages.
   In the year ended March 31, Dataproducts had a net loss of
$8.1 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $333.7
million. It had net income of $3.8 million, or 19 cents a
share, on revenue of $353.4 million the year before.
