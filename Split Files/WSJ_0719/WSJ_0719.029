   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Leafing through yet another
autopsy report as he prepared to meet the Swiss ambassador,
President Alfredo Cristiani appeared haunted by ghosts.
   This particular ghost was of a Swiss national who fought
with the nation's insurgent Marxist guerrillas. Judging from
the forensic report, the young Swiss may have been captured,
tortured and executed by the Salvadoran army 19 months ago --
months before Mr. Cristiani assumed the presidency. Mr.
Cristiani was ready for the Swiss ambassador to bring up the
death. Diplomats from several nations had brought similar
cases to him, he said.

   "They blame 70,000 deaths on me," said Mr. Cristiani,
throwing up his arms in exasperation. "This is a constant
problem."
   As the government and the guerrillas grope toward a
negotiated solution to El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war,
the ghosts of the victims of that war -- in particular those
of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter,
allegedly murdered by Salvadoran soldiers in November -- cast
a shadow on the future.
   Nine soldiers, including Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides,
who at the time of the killings was head of the military
academy here, have been arrested on murder charges. But since
their arrest, the investigation into the killings of the
Jesuits appears to have stalled. The priests were professors
at San Salvador's Central American University and key members
of the nation's intelligentsia.
   Evidence that could implicate other high-ranking officers
has been destroyed or lost. The missing evidence includes
Col. Benavides's personal notebooks and a logbook recording
comings and goings at the military school on the night of the
murder. (The Salvadoran government says the case is moving
forward, pointing to the recent detention by the military of
the officer who destroyed the logbook. "There have been
advances," says Ernesto Altschul, vice minister of the
presidency.)
   In Mexico, Miguel Saenz, a representative of the Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front, the guerrillas' umbrella group that
is negotiating a cease-fire with the government, says that if
the government can't clear up the case of the Jesuits, among
others, then it won't be able to guarantee the guerrillas'
physical safety if they put down arms and return to civilian
political life. "How do you convince the guerrillas they
won't become the ghosts of the future?" asks William
Leogrande, a Latin American expert at American University in
Washington.
   Outrage at the murders -- which many in Congress thought
made a mockery of the U.S. effort to turn the Salvadoran
military into a professional force -- and the slow pace of
the inquiry were the main reasons that the House of
Representatives voted in May to cut this year's military aid
to El Salvador 50%. U.S. aid to El Salvador is $315.4 million
this year, of which $85 million is military aid.
   Last month, the House approved the same level of military
aid cuts for fiscal year 1991. The final aid cuts will be
subject to negotiations between the administration and
congressional leaders, but opponents of military aid say they
count on a solid majority to cut back aid as part of a plan
to encourage a negotiated solution to the war. "The Jesuit
case is the straw that broke the camel's back," says a House
staffer.
   Mr. Cristiani worries that such an aid reduction would
jeopardize the current United Nations-sponsored peace
negotiations with the FMLN. For different reasons, both sides
think the negotiations have a real chance of ending the
country's bitter civil war.
   "What the {U.S.} Congress is doing is to pose the
possibility that the FMLN will take the military route," says
Mr. Cristiani, as he drives a 10,000-pound armored jeep
across town.
   Since the first round of negotiations in Caracas in May,
the guerrillas have continued their attacks, even knocking
out electricity in part of the capital on the anniversary of
Mr. Cristiani's first year in office. Recently, unidentified
gunmen killed an army major in the capital.
   But even as the attacks continue, enormous pressures exist
on both sides to reach a negotiated peace. Internationally,
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, and the
electoral defeat of their Sandinista allies in next-door
Nicaragua, have greatly isolated the guerrillas, challenging
some of their fundamental assumptions, although not their
ability to wage war.
   Conversely, the new era of U.S.-Soviet cooperation means
that for the U.S., El Salvador has lost whatever strategic
importance it had. In an era of tight budgets, it becomes
difficult to justify continued U.S. involvement. "The only
problem left is El Salvador," says Mr. Cristiani to a
visiting diplomat. "It's possible that the U.S. has grown
bored with it."
   Analysts say last year's bloody November guerrilla
offensive may have convinced both sides that the only way out
is through negotiations, which are expected to resume
sometime later this month. For, while the guerrillas failed
to spark a mass insurrection, they nevertheless demonstrated
impressive military capacity and brought the war to the
capital's wealthy suburbs. "The armed forces now sees that a
military defeat is impossible, that it's better to
negotiate," says the FMLN's Mr. Saenz. "The military
offensive opened up a political space for a negotiated
solution."
   But since the offensive the guerrillas have also softened
their demands. Both sides agreed to reach a mid-September
cease-fire contingent on first reaching agreement on ways to
"demilitarize" the country and instituting political and
military reforms. A second round of negotiations in Mexico
City failed to bring about agreement on those reforms, but
both sides say that tough issues were aired and progress was
made. "We see things with some optimism," says Mr. Altschul.
"We want to stop the armed encounters as quickly as
possible."
   Analysts say Mr. Cristiani may not be able to deliver on
that, given strong opposition from hard-liners in the armed
forces and in the ruling right-wing Arena party, where former
Maj. Roberto D'Abuisson, a charismatic politician with
alleged links to death squads, holds sway. Mr. Cristiani
insists both the party and the military are ready to
negotiate in good faith. "There are many people who have
criticized the armed forces," he says. "They will be
pleasantly surprised."
