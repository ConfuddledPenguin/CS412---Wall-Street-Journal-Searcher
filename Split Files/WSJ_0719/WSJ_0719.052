   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $50.35 billion
agriculture bill that would deny funding for new federal
crop-insurance policies in fiscal 1991 and tighten spending
limits on export-promotion programs favored by the Bush
administration.
   Operating funds for the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. would
be cut by more than half to $101.6 million. While money is
provided to meet current commitments, the measure calls for
the government to issue no new crop-insurance policies after
Sept. 30.

   The action adds to the pressure on House and Senate
Agriculture Committees to revise the troubled program. More
broadly, the underlying bill reflects the determination of
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten to
remain a major player in farm policy. Long impatient with the
administration's export policies, the Mississippi Democrat
was also a force behind a proposed $500 million cap for
spending on commodities provided under the Export Enhancement
Program -- or $400 million below President Bush's proposal.
   Among major nutrition programs, food stamp expenditures
would grow to more than $19 billion, or 12% above current
levels, and an estimated $2.35 billion is provided for the
so-called WIC nutrition program aimed at low-income pregnant
women and their infants. The new WIC appropriations represent
a 10% increase from fiscal 1990, but $25 million would be
held indefinitely as a reserve against higher-than-expected
prices and a shortfall of funds at the state level, such as
those seen earlier this year.
   Among regulatory agencies, $688.7 million is provided for
the Food and Drug Administration, or more than 30% above the
administration's budget.
   But in a major blow to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the bill would effectively freeze the agency's
funding at $39.7 million, or almost $5.3 million below the
president's request. The lower level is based on pending
legislation that would shift oversight of stock-index futures
from the CFTC to securities regulators.
   Adopted 335-86, the overall measure is the seventh of the
annual spending bills to clear the House in recent weeks. The
action comes as the Senate Appropriations Committee has begun
to draft its own legislation under what amounts to a shotgun
budget resolution for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
Domestic programs, including agriculture, face cuts from
House-passed levels. But in a striking study of power, the
Senate committee leadership has used its position to protect
energy and water accounts that have been a longstanding
preserve for senior members from the South and West.
   An estimated $20.9 billion energy and water bill reported
from subcommittee yesterday represents a 13% increase from
current appropriations. Within these limits, tens of millions
of dollars are earmarked for projects favored by those
senators who have been instrumental in helping the Senate
appropriations leadership resolve its budget hurdles.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, preserved $20.6 million -- which was cut by
the House -- for special nuclear-material research at the Los
Alamos laboratory in his home state of New Mexico. Meanwhile,
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole would secure at least $4
million for a new physical-science center at Fort Hays State
University near his home town of Russell, Kan.
   The Appalachian Regional Commission would receive $180
million, or more than triple the administration's request,
with $45 million slated for road projects in southern West
Virginia, home of Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd. Mr. Byrd, a Democrat, separately secured $6 million in
additional funds for the Tug Forks dam project in West
Virginia, and $10 million is earmarked for a medical research
facility at West Virginia University.
   The chairman and ranking Republican on the energy and
water subcommittee, Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) and Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.), split $25 million in university
funds for two projects in their home states, and Mr. Johnston
added $30 million for the Red River waterway to Shreveport
within accounts for the Corps of Engineers.
   Overall totals for the bills follow the patterns set in
the House. Construction funding for the Corps of Engineers
would grow to more than $1.3 billion, with another $641
million provided for Bureau of Reclamation construction. An
estimated $10.98 billion is allocated for atomic-energy
defense activities, and though marginally less than the
House, the Senate bill provides $2.68 billion for cleaning up
nuclear weapons plants, or $318.9 million more than the
administration's request.
   Among major research priorities, the measure provides
almost $318 million for the massive superconducting
supercollider, which is an atom smasher, to be built in
Texas. Solar-energy funding would increase by more than 40%
to $129.6 million, including $46.9 million for photovoltaic
energy systems.
