   A Forum for Blacks
   In Leadership Roles

   LOOKING FOR black role models? "SuccessGuide" is to
publish the names and phone numbers of 44,500 black achievers
in seven major markets, including New York, Chicago,
Washington and Atlanta, next January.
   George Fraser, a former Procter &amp; Gamble marketing
manager, launched the directory two years ago with a
5,000-name guide for the Cleveland area. The four-color 1990
Cleveland book includes names of executives, high school
principals, visiting nurses and even caterers.
   Mr. Fraser says his directories answer a need by ambitious
African-Americans for information about other blacks who can
help them succeed. This "intellectual capital," he says, is
the black community's least-developed asset. Black magazines
feature stories about blacks and black-owned businesses, but
SuccessGuide aims "to identify role models not by tens, but
by the thousands," says Mr. Fraser.
   People listed must agree to accept phone calls from
SuccessGuide users. At $10 each, some 12,500 of the 1990
Cleveland books have been sold on newsstands and by direct
marketing to those listed in the directory. Advertising will
account for 70% of the $2.5 million Mr. Fraser expects to
gross this year, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Sneaker Makers Face
   Scrutiny From Push
                                                                                                       

   BLACKS SHOULD shun some sneaker brands if their makers
don't spend more with black businesses, says the Rev. Tyrone
Crider, executive director of Operation Push.
   Representatives of black-owned ad and media firms decided
to press sneaker makers to procure more services from black
companies at a meeting last month at the Chicago headquarters
of Push, an activist group.
   The athletic shoe market is driven by the preferences of
minority youth, but black media received little of the $94
million reportedly spent by the top five brands on ads last
year. Mr. Crider expects Push's board to approve plans to
target a sneaker firm for negotiations at the organization's
convention in Chicago next week. If negotiations fail, a
boycott could be urged, he says.
   Nike Inc., the domestic sales leader, has a good chance of
being that target, he says.
   Nike recently cited its absence from black media in
response to another race-related controversy. The Beaverton,
Ore., company had been under fire for marketing its expensive
sneakers directly to poor black youth. A sportswriter had
sparked widespread interest when he charged that black
teenagers were killing for the sneakers. "We don't market by
race," a spokeswoman says. "We market our product by sport."
   Push has had a low national profile in recent years as
founder Jesse Jackson focused on two presidential bids. In
1980, after a 40-day boycott organized by Push, Coca-Cola Co.
agreed to buy some $30 million in products and services from
black businesses and granted its first black-owned bottling
franchise.
                                                                                                       

   Minority Dealerships
   Hurt in Auto Slump
                                                                                                       

   WHEN DETROIT'S fortunes slide, minority car dealers can be
the hardest hit.
   Slow domestic auto sales are causing a shakeout among
black dealers. At the end of 1989, General Motors Corp. had
104 black-owned franchises, most nurtured by a program to aid
minority dealerships. At the end of June, the company had 90.
Total 1989 sales for the top 10 Hispanic-owned dealerships
ranked by Hispanic Business magazine fell 5% to $764 million.
   Minority dealers tend to be new to the business, with less
of a cushion built up to soften downturns. For example, 57 of
the top 100 dealers ranked by Black Enterprise magazine were
started since 1985. Another problem is that minority dealers
-- with only a tiny share of Big Three dealerships -- have
been nearly shut out of the healthy import-car business.
Import leader Toyota, for example, has only seven black and
seven Latino dealers out of 1,100. A Toyota spokeswoman says
the company is always looking for qualified minority dealers,
but doesn't include race in the selection criteria.
   Gregory Baranco, a multi-franchise dealer in Atlanta and
the nation's only black dealer of Honda's Acura luxury cars,
says that black import-car buyers might think twice about
their purchases if they knew the lack of minority
participation in the market, "but these facts aren't printed
in Consumer Reports."
                                                                                                       

   Solar Energy Powers
   Puerto Rican Quest
                                                                                                       

   PUERTO RICO'S hopes for a place in the high-tech market
are riding on three slim tires this week.
   A solar-powered vehicle built by students from the
University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez is in a race from
Florida to Michigan sponsored by General Motors. The team is
up against 31 other schools in the 10-day "Sunrayce" contest
for solar-powered cars that is to end today.
   "The Shining Star of the Caribbean," as the University of
Puerto Rico car is called, was conceived, designed, built and
promoted by a team of students and faculty members. It is
billed as Puerto Rico's first home-grown high-tech product.
   The car has run near the rear of the pack, but win or
lose, its backers hope to attract attention to Puerto Rico's
technological potential. A new public agency with a mission
to promote the island's high technology ventures pitched in
$300,000 to get the project started a year ago.
   The real goal, says Diego Loinaz, director of the agency,
is to prove to the world that "we `browns' are not less at
all."
