   CyCare, a data processing concern, plans to "go back to
working with physician-controlled medical groups and
hospitals," said a spokesman. In recent years, CyCare had
begun providing systems to certain kinds of health
maintenance organizations and other non-physician controlled
health-care concerns.
   The "strategic redirection" reflects a six-month review of
company operations initiated by Raymond R. Maturi, who became
president and chief operating officer in January, the
spokesman said. In the next 18 months, the company plans to
close, or significantly reduce in size, four of its 15 major
offices.
