   Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a larger-than-expected net loss
for its second quarter, a further sign that the company's
position in the database software market is slipping.
   Ashton-Tate posted a net loss of $12.6 million, or 47
cents a share, for the quarter. Net revenue declined 19% to
$48.1 million.

   The Torrance, Calif., company's fortunes have been hurt by
a long delay in the release of a new database product and
failed effort at diversifying into other software markets.
   "It was expected to be a bad quarter, but this was worse
than expected," said David Bayer, an analyst at Montgomery
Securities, who had anticipated that Ashton-Tate would have a
loss of only $500,000 for the quarter.
   Mr. Bayer said the company's sales fell in the quarter
because customers anticipate that Ashton-Tate will shortly
introduce a revamped version of dBASE 4, its flagship
product. The company declined to comment on the introduction
date.
