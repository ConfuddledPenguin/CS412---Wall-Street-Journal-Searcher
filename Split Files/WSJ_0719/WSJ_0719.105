   WASHINGTON -- A top investigator for the Resolution Trust
Corp. said the agency expects "major" criminal actions to be
brought eventually against officials of 40% of the failed
savings-and-loan associations taken over by the government.
   James Dudine, assistant director of RTC investigations,
said the agency also expects to bring civil actions charging
malfeasance by directors and officers at 55% of the insolvent
thrifts. The RTC, created by last year's S&amp;L legislation to
sell off and liquidate hundreds of insolvent thrifts, has
taken over about 450 thrifts and has sold or liquidated about
210.

   The RTC believes civil claims against accountants will be
brought in 22% of the cases, and against attorneys in about
18%, Mr. Dudine said.
   RTC investigators also believe about 15% of the failed
thrifts colluded with other thrifts in fraudulent
transactions such as joint real-estate deals and loan swaps,
he added.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said that agency was concerned that judges
aren't giving sufficiently stiff sentences to those convicted
of S&amp;L fraud. Though the Justice Department has pointed to
some executives who have received as much as 30-year
sentences, that is "the exception," Mr. Ryan said.
