   NEW YORK -- Investors knocked prices of long-term Treasury
bonds sharply lower yesterday on fears that the Federal
Reserve is temporarily giving up its fight against inflation.
   Bond prices dropped as soon as New York Trading began,
falling about 1/2 point on news that the consumer price index
-- a key measure of inflation -- jumped 0.5% in June, higher
than expected.

   The market tumbled further on comments made by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Some investors interpreted
Mr. Greenspan's comments to suggest that the nation's central
bank may be forced to ease credit conditions further, if it
appears that the credit crunch is growing worse. Mr.
Greenspan made his comments to Congress in his semiannual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
   The news about possible easing, coming on top of a
disappointing inflation report, "left the distinct impression
that the Fed was biased toward easing policy and that its
fight against inflation has taken a back seat to other
considerations," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa
Securities America Inc.
   Rising inflation is the bond market's worst fear. The
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly one point, a
loss of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,
rose to 8.54%
   Several weeks ago, bond investors would have cheered if
the Fed Chairman were to hint that lower rates were on the
horizon. But investors now view inflation as a growing threat
to the value of their portfolios and they have become
suspicious of Mr. Greenspan's motives for easing credit
conditions at this time.
   "If you had asked many people last week if the Fed should
ease, most would have said yes. But now investors are worried
because they believe that if the Fed eases monetary policy
again, inflation will get worse. I think it is an unwarranted
fear, but it's out there," said Charles Lieberman, a managing
director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
   Mr. Greenspan confirmed that the Fed nudged the Federal
Funds rate to 8% from 8.25% just last week. And holding out
the possibility of a further ease in policy, the Fed chairman
said the central bank must remain alert to the possibility
that an adjustment in bank reserves might be needed to
maintain stable overall financial conditions.
   "Investor faith in the Fed's commitment to turn back
inflation is now being tested," said John Lonski, senior
economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. "Without a
meaningful slackening of the economy, additional reductions
in the federal funds rate are likely to feed inflation
expectations and thereby push bond prices lower despite lower
money-market rates."
   But Mr. Lieberman believes that investors "got a little
carried away. The fact that Greenspan has eased, is an
indication to me that he must have significant concerns,"
about the economy.
   In any case, investors are very worried. The CPI report is
"very disappointing and it brings up memories of
stagflation," said Michael M. Spencer, a vice president and
portfolio manager at One Federal Asset Management, Boston.
"It's too soon to say if {stagflation} is actually happening,
but that's the fear in the markets," he said. Stagflation is
a term created in the 1970s to describe the previously
unprecedented combination of slow economic growth and rising
prices and unemployment. So far, unemployment hasn't risen.
   Also weighing on prices in the long end of the market,
traders and analysts said, are signs of a possible snag in
Congressional negotiations to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
   "There is some concern about the near-term outlook on
budget negotiations with the passage of the House Republican
resolution," said James Capra, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. Earlier yesterday,
Republicans in the House of Representatives approved a
resolution in a voice vote that declared their opposition to
any deficit reduction plan that includes new taxes.
   Meanwhile, as yields on long-term bonds jumped, yields of
short-term securities were only slightly changed. Thus the
spread, or gap, between rates on long-term and short-term
rates widened sharply yesterday. Bond market analysts refer
to that condition as a steepening yield curve.
   The Treasury's key long bond now yields .40 percentage
point more than the outstanding two-year note. That spread
stood at .30 percentage points late Tuesday. A little less
than a week ago, just before Mr. Greenspan disclosed that the
Fed was poised to ease policy to offset a credit crunch, the
30-year bond yielded just 0.17 percentage point more than the
two-year note.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
102 4/32, down from 103 3/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield
rose to 8.54% from 8.45%. Two-year notes were quoted late at
a price of 100 13/ 32, little changed from 100 12/32 on
Tuesday. The yield was virtually unchanged at 8.12%.
   Rates on Treasury bills were also little changed to
slightly lower. The discount rate on three-month bills ended
at 7.56% compared with 7.61% on Tuesday while the rate on
six-month bills ended at 7.48% compared with 7.49% on
Tuesday. The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills eased
yesterday to 7.79% from 7.85% while the yield on six-month
bills eased to 7.86% from 7.87%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Modest profit-taking pressured junk bond prices after they
rose to sharply higher levels during two explosive days of
trading.
   Prices on most high-yield debt issues were 1/8 to 1/4
lower after gaining between one and three points since
Monday.
   The recent stampede to invest in the junk bond market was
set off by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s release on Monday of the
details of its $6.9 billion recapitalization plan.
   Trading in RJR's most widely held debt, the pay-in-kind
bonds, more than tripled in the wake of the announcement.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities. Volume in the broader market nearly doubled on
Monday, and remained sharply higher for much of Tuesday.
   But investors have largely digested RJR's refinancing
package, and the junk bond market has resumed the modest
volume that has characterized high-yield trading for most of
the month, traders say.
   Some investors have seen the calm after the storm as a
chance to consolidate their positions and take profits,
traders say.
   But RJR's junk bonds continued to post strong gains. The
company's convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009, for
example, added 3/8 point to end at 116 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The bonds have gained 10 1/8 points since
Monday.
   In the high-grade corporate bond market, prices were flat
to lower. Bonds of shorter maturity were little changed,
while the longer end of the market slipped 1/8 to 1/4 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds followed the Treasury market lower, with
prices generally ending off 1/8 to 1/4 point, while some
issues fell as much as 5/8 point.
   After more than $1.3 billion in new municipal debt hit the
market Tuesday, the pace of new issuance leveled off
considerably, with only more than $272 million in debt being
priced yesterday.
   In one of the largest deals of the day, a Chase Securities
Inc. group placed the winning bid for $195 million Washington
state general obligation and motor vehicle fuel tax revenue
bonds.
   The bonds were priced for reoffering to yield from 5.75%
in 1991 to 6.96% in 2010.
   No large new municipal issues are expected to be priced
today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   West German government bonds rose sharply yesterday as
heavy domestic buying boosted prices.
   Bonn's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.80 point to yield
8.36% while five-year notes rose 0.36 point to yield 8.60%.
   Among yesterday's buyers, which included pension funds and
other institutional investors, was the Bundesbank, West
Germany's central bank.
   "I don't know if they {the Bundesbank} are preparing the
ground for new bonds or what, but they've been good buyers,"
said one London trader.
   Analysts believe that either a new government bond or
another German Unity Fund Bond is expected in the next few
weeks.
   In Japan, a firmer yen kept bond prices from posting large
declines and prices ended just modestly weaker.
   However, some dealers believe the continued rise in
Japanese short-term interest rates ultimately will swamp
whatever support that the yen can give the bond market.
   One dealer said the "Bank of Japan {the central bank}
wants rates higher" but they want to move cautiously to keep
the Japanese financial markets from nearly collapsing as they
did early this year. Nonetheless "the Bank of Japan does want
the yield curve steeper," he said. So "the money market is
clearly pricing in higher rates" and "there is a defensive
psychology in the Japanese government bond market" as a
result, he said.
   In exchange trading, Japan's benchmark 10-year bond fell
0.07 point to yield 7.27%. (Foreign bond yields are quoted
here in local terms and therefore differ from yields
calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms, which
tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare yields
across markets.)
   In London, the British gilts market ended little changed
after a quiet day as market participants await additional May
and June U.K. economic data today.
                                                                                                       

   Asset, Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities fell as much as 3/8
point, taking their cues from the Treasury market.
   The asset-backed market was abuzz yesterday with news
about several new offerings. There was talk of a $1 billion
   Chrysler Corp. offering backed by auto loans soon-to-be
priced by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Chemical Banking Corp. said it will handle the debut of
Allied Stores Corp. asset-backed commercial paper. The deal
would represent the first time a company under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection will access the investment grade
asset-backed commercial paper market. Allied is a unit of
Campeau Corp.
   Separately, a unit of General Motors Corp., GMAC
Residential Funding, said it filed a $4 billion shelf
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
the issuance of registered securities backed by residential
mortgages.
   It is the largest private-label mortgage-related
securities shelf registration on record, the company said.
GMAC Residential purchases "jumbo," or "nonconforming,"
residential mortgages that exceed the purchasing-size limits
used by Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. It then securitizes those loans and
issues double-A or triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities.
The firm was the leading private-label issuer of
mortgage-backed securities in 1989.
