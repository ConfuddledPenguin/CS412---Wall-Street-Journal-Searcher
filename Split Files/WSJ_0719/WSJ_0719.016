   Your June 18 page-one story about Plum Creek Timber
("Unkindest Cut: Timber Firm Stirs Ire Felling Forests Faster
Than They Regenerate") is a rehash that all but ignores the
significant environmental and financial strides we've been
making over a number of years. You left the reader with no
sense of our direction and commitment. There clearly was no
effort to balance the positions of our critics with Plum
Creek's record on the ground.
   You leave the mistaken impression that Plum Creek is
financially unsound. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Our debt-to-capital ratio is average for our industry and we
have no junk-bond financing. Moreover, we have a strong
balance sheet with excellent cash reserves.

   At Plum Creek, profitability and environmental
responsibility go hand in hand because we are committed to
being in the timber business long-term. Plum Creek is a
leader in developing alternatives to clear cutting and
implementing "new forestry" practices that better preserve
wildlife and the forest ecosystem while allowing reasonable
timber harvests.
   At a time when it makes economic sense to have 200-plus
acre harvests, we have voluntarily limited ours in Washington
state's Cascades to 90 acres. While several of our
longstanding critics cited in the article allege that Plum
Creek is overcutting its land in response to overseas
markets, the numbers tell a different story altogether. We
have scaled back our Cascade harvest by 45% since 1986
despite near-record prices for timber. We expect further
reductions in our harvest firm-wide as we move to managed
stands. These initiatives demonstrate our sensitivity to the
environment, our communities and our commitment to the
long-term.
   Your reporter completely neglected our positive record on
threatened and endangered species, on habitat preservation
and water quality, one that is second to none. Our wildlife
biologist and hydrologist play an integral role in our
planning and harvest decisions.
   In Washington state, Plum Creek has adjusted plans and
harvest schedules as a result of spotted-owl surveys it has
conducted. It is deferring harvests and is involved in road
management and cooperative research to protect elk migration
and calving. In Montana, we sponsor research and implement
management plans to protect bald-eagle and grizzly habitats.
In all our states, we monitor water quality and conduct
studies of aquatic insects and sediment samples in
cooperation with state, federal and tribal organizations.
   I am proud of our loggers, foresters and scientists and
their forestry practices. Their record is a good one and it's
getting better. Our employees, unit holders and customers are
angry that your article missed so much.

   You fail to explain what most grade-school kids out here
in Montana know: Mature forests generate negligible growth.
If growing more timber is a desired goal, the only way is for
firms to manage a transition to second-growth forests, where
the mean annual-growth increment per acre is significantly
higher. To chastise Plum Creek on the one hand for harvesting
more than it grows and on the other for cutting mature timber
reflects a misunderstanding of forest management.
   The controversies facing the forest-products industry in
the Pacific Northwest are technically complex and emotionally
charged. Prudent policy responses must be rooted in keen
understanding of economic processes as opposed to knee-jerk
reactions to environmentalists whose voices, in your words,
are "tight with emotion."

   It's clear that the 19th-century robber baron of the
Burlington Northern is alive and well today. The barony
remains intact, but the times have changed.
   There's something terribly wrong with our values and
concepts of ownership when a bunch of vandals like this are
allowed to destroy irreplaceable natural resources in search
of short-term profit.
   It's particularly grating to hear this kind of
self-justification from a company that has enjoyed a generous
bounty from our citizenry in past generations. It's time for
a "giveback."

   It is disturbing to me that while Eastern Europe is
attempting to "privatize," there is a growing tendency in the
U.S. to restrict private-property rights in the name of
"commonality."
