   NEW YORK -- Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. is a classic Wall Street
"smart money" investor.
   From 1971 to 1978, Warburg Pincus and its affiliated
partnerships invested $15 million in Waste Management Co.; it
cashed out in 1981 for $66 million. The low-profile
partnership scored another coup in 1983, when it led a group
that bought 45% of troubled toy-maker Mattel Inc. Since then,
Warburg Pincus has quadrupled its money in Mattel.

   "They're brilliant," says John Myers, an executive vice
president at General Electric Co.'s pension fund, which
invests with Warburg Pincus. Adds another investor, William
Snow, treasurer of Johns Hopkins University: "They pick good
companies, and they get very involved in management."
   The only trouble is, Warburg Pincus's knack for smart
investments may be waning. The firm still boasts an
extraordinary long-term record: profits that average 25% a
year since 1971. For most of the 1980s, though, its gains
have slipped to about 18 1/2% a year after fees -- only
slightly ahead of the stock market's performance, investors
say.
   Currently, Warburg Pincus is mired in a losing position in
Community Newspapers Inc., a joint investment that it made
with newspaper publisher Ralph Ingersoll in 1987. Last year
-- when stock market averages jumped 31% -- Warburg Pincus's
$1.1 billion 1986 fund posted only a 10% gain. Concedes
Chairman Lionel Pincus: "It wasn't a great year for us."
   All the same, money has poured in from backers such as the
pension funds of GE, General Motors Corp. and Pacific Telesis
Group. Headed by the 59-year-old Mr. Pincus and Vice Chairman
John Vogelstein, 56, Warburg Pincus invests $3 billion of
institutional money.
   Mr. Pincus "is one of the most effective money raisers I
ever saw," says Stanley Pratt, a general partner in Abbott
Capital Management. Mr. Pratt adds that Mr. Vogelstein, a
former partner at the investment bank Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
"is very bright -- the Mr. Inside of the outfit."
   This spring, Warburg Pincus raised $1.78 billion, the New
York firm's biggest investment fund ever. That money, says
Mr. Pincus, will be used for "venture banking," an eclectic
mix of venture capital, turnaround investments in troubled
companies and minority stakes in companies that Warburg
Pincus partners think are cheaply valued.
   Just how well Warburg Pincus performs depends in part on
several big turnaround bets made between 1987 and 1989. The
biggest, at more than $190 million, is a battery of newspaper
investments that Warburg Pincus jointly made with Mr.
Ingersoll. This spring, Warburg Pincus bought out Mr.
Ingersoll's financially troubled U.S. interests in a swap for
Warburg Pincus's holdings in a few European newspapers.
   Mr. Pincus, though known as affable and easy-going to
outsiders, negotiated a tough deal with Mr. Ingersoll.
Although both parties insist that the negotiations produced
an even swap, Warburg Pincus ended up with U.S. publications
that at year-end 1989, at least, had a significantly larger
equity value than the European operations.
   Mr. Pincus asserts that the one-time Ingersoll newspapers
"will turn out to be a profitable investment" for Warburg
Pincus. That may be news to bondholders of Community
Newspapers Inc., one part of the former Ingersoll empire.
Community Newspapers failed to make an interest payment due
July 1 on its 13% bonds, which currently trade at about 64
cents on the dollar.
   In coming weeks, Mr. Pincus and his partners must
negotiate a repayment plan for bondholders. That probably
will involve putting in more equity to ward off the risk of
having the company thrown into bankruptcy proceedings.
   "We do have a loss in Community Newspapers," Mr. Pincus
says. But he expects to make that up in other parts of the
Ingersoll U.S. newspaper empire, notably Ingersoll Newspapers
Inc., which publishes suburban newspapers around St. Louis
and other U.S. cities. New management under Warburg Pincus
has indicated a willingness to cut costs and sell off assets;
Mr. Ingersoll had by his own admission taken "higher risks,"
such as starting the defunct St. Louis Sun. That left Warburg
Pincus "uncomfortable," Mr. Ingersoll had told an
interviewer.
   Another of Warburg Pincus's big turnaround bets, a $150
million investment in Mellon Bank, is about at break-even.
Here, too, Mr. Pincus and his partners had negotiated fine
terms for the initial investment in the then-slumping
Pittsburgh bank. They bought convertible preferred stock in
1988 that some analysts suggested was priced at 20% or more
below market value. (Mellon has disputed that valuation.)
   Mr. Pincus is convinced that Mellon's management team can
sort its way through problem real-estate loans and boost
profitability. Mellon Bank's stock has traded in the area of
$25 a share ever since Warburg Pincus bought in, but that
doesn't trouble Mr. Pincus. "We're patient longterm
investors," he says. "The banking system is a mess. That's
what makes it interesting."
   Other major holdings by Warburg Pincus, such as 47% of
personal-computer retailer ComputerLand Inc. and 29% of Magma
Copper Co., have been on the books too briefly to warrant
revaluation.
   Warburg Pincus also has a wide scattering of investments
in the $2 million to $5 million range in fledgling companies.
Their carrying value on Warburg Pincus's books won't be
adjusted for years, until the companies go public. But an
executive familiar with Warburg Pincus's portfolio says that
three or four of these companies may go public this year,
producing as much as fourfold profits for Warburg Pincus.
   However, one big source of investment opportunities for
Warburg Pincus, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is gone for
good. In the 1980s, Warburg Pincus used junk bonds
underwritten by Drexel to help finance some of its
investments; it also teamed up with loyal Drexel clients such
as Mr. Ingersoll. Drexel "charged a great deal of money, but
they delivered," Mr. Pincus says. "It was a very good and
professional relationship."
   Near-term, Mr. Pincus isn't certain where his firm's next
deals will come from. Stocks seem overpriced, he says. He is
inclined to wait a bit to see if prices come down. "If you
buy high," he says, "you've got a lot more work to do to make
a profit."
