   WASHINGTON -- New government figures suggest the housing
industry is suffering from a slump that rivals the 1982
recession.
   Housing starts dropped for the fifth consecutive month
during June, according to the Commerce Department, falling a
steep 2.3% to an annual rate of 1,177,000. That's the lowest
level since the 1,173,000 rate in October 1982, near the
bottom of the most recent recession.

   "The multifamily market is in a genuine recession, if not
depression," said David Seiders, chief economist of the
National Association of Homebuilders. "The outlook there is
very dim indeed." Mr. Seiders said a survey conducted by the
homebuilders group shows increasing pessimism for
single-family home construction as well.
   Separately, the Labor Department reported consumer prices
jumped 0.5% last month, signaling that inflation continues to
be a problem. Prices for food and housing led the way,
posting their largest increases since January.
   Economists expressed disappointment over the inflation
figures, worrying that the rise in prices, particularly in
the cost of services, could damp consumer confidence. The
June price increase "is higher than the wage increase,"
commented Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic
forecasting project at Georgia State University, "so the
average American worker found that their standard of living
fell, and that cannot be good for the economic expansion."
   The new figures illustrate the dilemma that faces Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Economic growth is
very slow, and in some sectors such as housing a full-fledged
recession is clearly under way. But inflation remains a
threat, leaving the central bank with little room to ease
credit. Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee
yesterday that the inflation figures are "higher than we
would like to see." But he added that "the core of inflation
in consumer prices . . . has moderated in recent months."
   The biggest factors in the jump in consumer prices were
increases of 0.7% in the cost of food and beverages and 0.6%
in housing. Food and beverages account for nearly 18% of the
Labor Department's consumer price index, and housing for more
than 40%. Medical care costs, which account for about 6% of
the index, rose 0.7%.
   Medical care costs have risen 9% over the 12 months ended
in June, faster than any other category in the index. Meat
and poultry products rose 1.5% for the month, as did fruits
and vegetables. Gasoline prices also rose sharply, up 2.5%.
   The continued decline in housing starts gave analysts
little evidence that the housing industry will snap out of
its slump in the near future. Tighter lending by banks and
high interest rates helped to keep starts down, with last
month's housing down 16.8% from the level of a year earlier.
   "The revision last month and the numbers this month are
really very low numbers and are certainly not heartening to
us," remarked Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National
Council of Savings Institutions. "Poor consumer confidence,
higher-than-desired interest rates, and lower income growth
-- the combination makes housing less affordable than we
would like to see."
   Mr. Regalia said he found a glimmer of hope in the rise in
building permits in June, up 3.9% from May for an annual rate
of 1,107,000 permits. "It tells me that we have fallen off
the cliff and are still able to crawl away from the
situation."
   Figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal
variations.
