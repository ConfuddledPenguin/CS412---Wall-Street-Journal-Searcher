   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and its major unions
took a big step toward trying to rein in soaring health care
costs by selecting three companies to manage a health care
system for 100,000 nonmanagement employees in the U.S.
   The new system gives a huge boost to a recent trend among
companies to develop health care networks of doctors and
hospitals to provide care for their employees at lower costs.
It also represents an unusual management-labor effort to
address the health cost issue, consultants said, and could
influence labor negotiations in a variety of industries.

   "There's been a real movement in the past two years for
these kinds of arrangements," says Robert Levin of the
Washington Business Group on Health. The AT&amp;T plan "is
characteristic of the growing corporate interest" in more
effective purchasing of health care.
   AT&amp;T spends $3 million a day on health care overall and
about $500 million a year for its non-management employees.
Costs have risen about 10% a year since 1984, not as sharply
as at many other companies, but nevertheless troublesome
enough to reflect the crisis corporate America sees in
medical costs. The company hopes the managed care program
will hold annual increases to single-digits by 1993.
   The nuts and bolts of the system don't break much new
ground in managed care, however. And both the company and the
union now face the challenge of encouraging non-management
employees and their 225,000 dependents to use the doctors and
hospitals belonging to the various networks.
   The company selected Prudential Insurance Co., Newark,
N.J., Travelers Corp., Hartford Conn., and Empire Blue Cross/
Blue Shield, New York, to manage the plan in 23 metropolitan
areas across the country. They were selected from among some
20 companies, including all the major insurers and several
health maintenance organizations that initially expressed
interest in the program. The companies were evaluated by a
health cost-containment committee set up in the aftermath of
a labor contract settlement in 1989 between the company and
its two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Under the plan, employees who get health care from members
of the networks set up by the insurers will pay $150
deductible and up to 10% of nonhospital medical procedures.
Hospitalization will be 100% covered. Those who see
physicians outside the plan will have a $200 deductible and
pay 20% of all care, in and out of the hospital, up to a
maximum of $1,000 a year.
   Hospitals and doctors in the plan agree to provide the
care at reduced prices. The three insurers will share in the
risk of providing the care: If they meet or exceed
predetermined targets of health costs per covered employee,
they will share in the savings; if they fail to meet the
goals, they will have to absorb a share of the overruns. AT&amp;T
wouldn't disclose the targets.
   "This plan will allow us to gain some kind of foothold to
flatten out the growth curve" in health costs, says John
Barry, division manager, human resources at the New York
communications giant. And rather than shifting costs to
employees, he added, "the terms will shift it to the provider
community-hospitals and doctors."
   Adds Joseph Martingale, of consultant Towers Perrin: "It
rewards efficiency, which isn't being done in indemnity
arrangements with fee-for-service medicine."
   Such terms are similar, and even less stringent than those
of some managed care plans adopted by other companies,
notably Allied Signal Corp. And the anticipated savings
aren't guaranteed. Both the company and the union must
persuade employees to use providers who are in the network.
   The out-of-pocket difference for employees might not be
enough to encourage them to leave their own doctors and steer
them into the network, says Robert Eicher, a consultant with
A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co.
   Few if any companies have been willing to force employees
to use company-selected doctors. If the AT&amp;T plan fails to
attract a significant number of workers, unrealized savings
would likely become the subject of labor talks in 1992,
consultants say.
   Union members on the health cost-containment committee won
some features in the plan that could help overcome barriers
to employee acceptance, says John Agee, a CWA representative
on the committee. For instance, any employee who currently
has a chronic or long-term illness such as cancer won't have
to change doctors and will be covered under the plan whether
the doctor is a member or not. And employees may nominate
doctors who aren't members to join the network; the doctors
would then be evaluated by the carriers to make sure they
meet requirements, Mr. Agee says.
   The selection was a boost for both Prudential and
Travelers. Prudential has handled dental insurance for AT&amp;T
but no other health care business for the company. Travelers
may lose some of the nonhospital business it now handles for
AT&amp;T, but consultants and an AT&amp;T spokeswoman said its share
of the contract boosts its effort to move into managed care,
not considered one of its strengths. Empire Blue Cross has
handled all of AT&amp;T's hospital business and now will lose
much of that business, even while winning a spot in the
nationwide system.
   The system will begin operation in October in seven areas
handled by Empire Blue Cross, including Minneapolis, Oklahoma
City, Atlanta and South Carolina. All 23 areas, accounting
for 72% of the nonmanagement employees, are to be in the
program by July 1991.
