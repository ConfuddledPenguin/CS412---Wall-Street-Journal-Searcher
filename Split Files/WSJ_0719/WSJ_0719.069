   As Gov. Mario Cuomo prepares to campaign for a third term,
and ponders a run for the White House in 1992, his role in
New York's fiscal deterioration is under increased scrutiny.
   Earlier this year, while unexpectedly slow revenue growth
was forcing the governor's budget office to increase its
deficit estimate by $2 billion, Mr. Cuomo called for a
double-digit rise in state spending. As a result, New Yorkers
-- already the highest-taxed people in the country -- will
pay an additional $1.8 billion in state taxes and fees this
year, including $400 million in higher income taxes. Despite
the state's pledge to reform future fiscal operations,
Moody's lowered its rating on the state's long-term debt.
Only the bonds of Massachusetts and Louisiana are rated
lower.

   So far the governor has successfully side-stepped
questions about his fiscal competency. He insists that the
state's problems stem from the economic slowdown in the
Northeast, and many New Yorkers accept this view. But New
York state has incurred deficits for eight of the past 10
years. During most of that period, the state's economy
performed better than the most Polyannish futurist would have
dared to predict in 1980.
   Population, after declining by 683,000 between 1970 and
1980, rose 2.2% between 1980 and 1989. Real income rebounded
from no growth to average annual increases of more than 3%
since 1980. Although it lagged neighboring states, New York
grew faster than the nation, with per-capita income rising
from 8.1% above the national average in 1980 to 16.9% above
in 1989. There are 1.2 million more New Yorkers working today
than when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983, and the state
jobless rate has been cut to below 5% from 8.6%.
   Had state spending merely kept pace with personal income,
Albany would be dispensing a multibillion-dollar surplus
today. But this opportunity was squandered: Spending rose
from 14.7% of personal income in 1983 to 16% in 1988.
   Paying for this profligacy is fairly painless when
personal income taxes, business taxes and taxes on real
estate transfers automatically rise relative to personal
income. Comes an economic slowdown and the process is
reversed -- last year business taxes fell 3.1% and
real-property gains taxes were off 28.6% even as personal
income continued to grow. But old spending habits die hard.
The fiscal 1991 budget, hammered out after the longest, most
contentious budget debate in state history, compromised on a
7.5% spending increase. The governor had requested a 10.9%
rise.
   Assessing the true size or even the direction of state
spending is not easy. The state's affairs are tangled in a
network of trust accounts, special funds and off-budget
enterprises expressly designed to confuse outsiders. Thus the
governor can claim to have "cut" school aid by $400 million
this year simply by waiving the state's annual pension
contribution to the teacher retirement fund. Similarly,
revenues will be "increased" by selling a state office
building to the state-run Urban Development Corp.
   These shenanigans are reminiscent of New York City before
the financial community shut it out of the credit markets in
1975. Ironically, part of the legacy of that crisis is that
New York state now requires the city to balance its budget on
the basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
fiscal discipline imposed by GAAP forced the city to lay off
workers and reduce essential services to close its budget gap
this year. In contrast, the state simply sold short-term
notes (a record $4.1 billion this spring) to cover its
shortfall, thereby avoiding unpleasant spending choices
during this election year.
   Is New York's deficit due to circumstances beyond its
control? Hardly. The state's payroll, for example, ballooned
from $3 billion in 1983 to $6.9 billion in 1988, a 130%
increase during a period when consumer prices rose 19%. In
1988 New York had 158 full-time employees for every 10,000
residents, compared with 107 in California, 124 in Texas, 114
in Florida and 104 in Pennsylvania. Over-staffing is obvious:
The newly established New York State Grace Commission might
explore why the Highway Department employs more than twice as
many workers per lane mile as the national average, and why
there are only 1.5 inmates per corrections worker here vs.
two per worker nationwide.
   The big money -- more than 50% of state spending -- goes
to education and social services. The Aid to Families with
Dependent Children grant has been increased four times in the
past six years, most recently a 15% rise that took effect
Jan. 1. It's politically untouchable. But why should the
state Department of Social Services, a $150 million agency
that does not issue a single welfare benefit check, be
allowed a 22% increase in its operating budget this year?
Medicaid costs three times more per recipient here than in
California, yet Albany shows no inclination to try the
market-oriented reforms that have successfully controlled
costs in that state.
   The highest per-pupil expenditure in the country has not
prevented New York's average SAT scores from sinking below
the national average. The school bureaucracy has flourished,
however. According to Albert Shanker, president of the
American Federation of Teachers, there are more school
administrators in New York than in all of Western Europe.
   New York City (which receives 34% of state education aid
and 60% of total state welfare allotments) is arguably in
worse fiscal shape than the state. Although state money to
bail out the city may be lacking, Albany's power to do so is
not.
   The state has imposed rent control on certain New York
City buildings since World War II. Decontrolling high-rent
apartments would increase city property taxes by more than
$370 million each year, according to Peat Marwick. A
capital-gains tax cut would increase the value of New York
real estate and breathe life into a securities industry that
has cut its New York City work force by 21,000 employees. The
privatization of state assets, ranging from airports to the
World Trade Center, could raise funds to restore the city's
crumbling infrastructure. Unfortunately, the political
establishment in both Albany and City Hall rejects these
policies.
   Many New Yorkers are encouraged by the apparent end of the
tax revolt in California. Few know that this flip-flop comes
after stringent spending limitations pushed that state's
spending down relative to personal income. (At one point Gov.
George Deukmejian actually rebated $1.1 billion of excess
revenues to state residents.) More important, few New Yorkers
know that their own governor wields both a line-item veto and
a broad impoundment authority -- powers for spending control
that President Bush can only dream about. Gov. Hugh Carey
used these weapons to reduce spending as a percentage of
personal income. It can be done again.
