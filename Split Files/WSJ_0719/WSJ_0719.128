   After listening to legal arguments by secular lawyers, a
special disciplinary committee of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America suspended a San Francisco congregation for
five years for hiring a lesbian couple as ministers.
   In addition, the committee of the nation's third-largest
Protestant denomination warned another San Francisco
congregation, which hired a gay man as a minister, that it
faced suspension within 30 days unless it made efforts to
comply with church law.

   The ruling yesterday -- unprecedented within the 5.2
million-member church -- stopped just short of expelling St.
Francis Lutheran Church, which installed Ruth Frost, 42 years
old, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, as assistant ministers six
months ago. Instead, it revoked the congregation's political
rights within the church, barring it from voting or
introducing legislation at church assemblies.
   The suspension will run until Dec. 31, 1995, after which
the 130-member congregation will face expulsion from the
church if it still doesn't comply with church law, said
Charles Ruthroth, assistant to Bishop Lyle Miller, who
brought the charges against the two congregations.
   The question of whether homosexuals should be allowed to
serve as clergy is becoming a deeply divisive issue within
several Protestant denominations. Some church leaders admit
to being torn between upholding biblical injunctions against
sex outside marriage and a more modern desire not to
discriminate against a minority group.
   Last month, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
head of the of 1.3 million-member Reform branch of Judaism,
voted to accept homosexuals into their ranks.
   Bishop Miller, head of the Lutheran church's Sierra
Pacific Synod -- a district that includes San Francisco --
charged that St. Francis Lutheran, by hiring Ms. Frost and
Ms. Zillhart, and First United Lutheran Church, by hiring
Jeff Johnson, 28, had violated the church's constitution.
   At hearings before the disclipinary committee earlier this
month, Bishop Miller said the church -- formed in 1988
through the merger of three smaller Lutheran denominations --
might collapse if individual congregations were allowed to
set their own rules for calling clergy. He charged the two
congregations with violating the church's provision that
ministers may be hired only if they are listed on a roster of
clergy candidates.
   The roster is compiled by a special committee within each
synod. A church rule prohibits the listing of anyone who is a
"practicing" homosexual. Ms. Frost and Ms. Zillhart were
never approved for the roster; Mr. Johnson was originally
listed, but then dropped after refusing to promise to lead a
celibate life.
   In the ruling, the disciplinary committee said that if Mr.
Johnson reapplied for listing on the clergy roster and was
approved, charges against First United Lutheran would be
dropped.
   The attorneys involved in the case found themselves in
unfamiliar waters. "From our perspective, it's difficult in
that it involves ultimate issues of life and being," said
Kathleen Kelly, chairwoman of the disciplinary committee and
a professor at McGeorge Law School of the University of the
Pacific in Sacramento, Calif. Tony Tanke, a staff attorney
for the California Supreme Court, worked with Ms. Kelly in
writing the decision.
   Ms. Kelly said she and Mr. Tanke were originally elected
to the committee as active lay people in the Lutheran church,
rather than as lawyers.
   Ms. Kelly said attorneys on both sides attempted to limit
their arguments to church law and theology. However, she
said, the attorney representing the congregations -- Richard
D. Warren of the San Francisco law firm of Landels, Ripley &amp;
Diamond -- appealed to the committee to follow the example of
the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1803 case of Marbury vs.
Madison, in which the court asserted the power of judicial
review. The analogy was used to prompt the committee to
review critically the church's law against the hiring of
homosexual ministers.

   SCRAMBLE OVER ASBESTOS class action heats up as judge
issues new order.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Parker, who is presiding over
asbestos cases in his court in Beaumont, Texas, said a class
action may be necessary to consolidate the hundreds of
thousands of asbestos personal-injury cases in the U.S. But
he said no action should be taken until all federal judges
handling major asbestos litigation can meet and agree on how
a nationwide class action should be structured. In a typical
class action, all similar cases are consolidated in a single
court and then tried together.
   Earlier this week, a federal judge in Cleveland ordered a
nationwide class action for the cases. Lawyers have said that
the impact of the Cleveland order was unclear because it
allowed cases in many courts to continue separate from the
class-action lawsuit.
   "The problem is a national one, and it calls for a
national solution," Judge Parker said. "Courts must set aside
regional concerns and become the problem solvers our society
rightly expects."
   He said the judges also will have to determine whether
defendants in the cases -- former makers and distributors of
asbestos -- lack sufficient funds to continue litigating the
cases.

   CURBSIDE GARBAGE can't be searched without a warrant,
state court rules.
   Rejecting precedents set by the U.S. Supreme Court and
nearly every state court that has confronted the issue, the
New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that police officers can't
search through curbside garbage bags without a search
warrant. However, the court said that officers can seize the
bags as part of a criminal investigation, as long as they
obtain a warrant before examining their contents.
   The court said the state's constitution guarantees New
Jersey citizens greater protection against unreasonable
searches than does the U.S. Constitution. In 1989, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment's prohibition
of unreasonable searches and seizures doesn't apply to
garbage left for collection in an area accessible to the
public.
   Two of the New Jersey court's seven justices dissented
from the opinion, criticizing the majority for departing from
the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

President Quayle and a former special assistant to President
Reagan for domestic affairs, will join the law faculty at
Northwestern University in the fall. Mr. Calabresi is
