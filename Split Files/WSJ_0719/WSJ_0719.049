   "Arachnophobia" could be thought of as the movie
equivalent of "lite beer": pleasant enough, not nearly as
enervating as the real thing, but not as satisfying either.
   This picture about deadly spiders taking over a peaceful
California town marks the directing debut of Frank Marshall,
who for the past decade has worked as a producer at Steven
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. Mr. Marshall also has
directed action sequences for several Spielberg projects,
including two of the Indiana Jones films and "Back to the
Future."

   So it isn't surprising that many of Mr. Marshall's tricks
have been pulled out of Mr. Spielberg's cabinet. There are
many familiar elements in this story of an ordinary man who
has to overcome the mysterious, fearsome forces of nature.
   Here, instead of an omnipotent shark, the menace arrives
in the form of large, ultra-poisonous spiders, unwittingly
imported from South America by an obsessive scientist. Having
set up this conceit, Mr. Marshall and screenwriters Don
Jakoby and Wesley Strick proceeded to figure out variations
on the spiders killing or threatening to kill the
townspeople. It's all laid out like a package tour; the film
moves from one destination to the next without the
troublesome detours that can result in either disaster or
something unexpectedly wonderful.
   Mr. Marshall has done an impressive job with much of the
creepy-crawly stuff. The picture builds nicely from the
portentous opening sequence, shot in Venezuela, that
introduces the long-hidden species of spider whose excavation
sets the story in motion. The British actor Julian Sands,
with his narrow-lipped aristocratic bearing and intensity, is
well cast as the scientist who leads the fateful expedition.
   The film takes on a lighter tone when the action moves to
Canaima, the fictional gingerbread-house town where the
spiders land, following an amusing series of coincidences.
The spiders arrive almost simultaneously with a new doctor
and his family, who have moved to Canaima from San Francisco
to escape the rigors of city living.
   Jeff Daniels endows the young doctor, Ross Jennings, with
the actor's trademark characteristic: the conventional man
who slyly mocks his own conventionality. His ordinariness
becomes comic when he's put in an extraordinary situation, as
he was in "Something Wild," and as he is here. Yet there's
something a little off-kilter with the way the film makers
casually kill off various characters without obvious satiric
purpose. For example, they take a nasty, sneering attitude
toward the old town doctor who spoils Ross's plans by
deciding not to retire, because his work keeps him alive.
When the spiders get him anyway, the Jennings family takes
over the dead doc's practice a bit too cheerily.
   In general, this efficiently made production cleverly
pushes the right buttons on cue. Yet its flippant tone blunts
any real sense of terror, and some of the more obvious comic
stunts seem mechanical. John Goodman appears in yet another
variation on his beer-guzzling fatso, this time as a somewhat
metaphysical exterminator. Not much thought seems to have
gone into this character. It's as though the film makers
figured it's enough to have Mr. Goodman show up looking
cutely porky. And perhaps they figured it exactly right, from
a commercial point of view: The preview audience I saw the
movie with yowled the instant Mr. Goodman appeared on screen.

   One of the most dangerous phrases to drop from an actor's
lips may be the words: "I'd like to direct." Luckily only a
powerful few are allowed to discover for themselves that
pulling a picture together isn't as simple as it might seem.
   The directorial training school of hard knocks for comedy
star Bill Murray was "Quick Change." He couldn't have picked
trickier territory than this wry comedy whose loose-limbed
deadpan humor would have challenged the most experienced
director. Mr. Murray and his co-director, Howard Franklin,
who adapted Jay Cronley's novel for the screen, succeed
mainly in illuminating what made them want to direct the
material. At least this picture struggles to emit a few gasps
of fresh air as it goes down.
   Mr. Murray, who also co-produced, plays Grimm, a
disillusioned city planner. He decides to abandon New York
with his girlfriend (Geena Davis), his slow-witted pal (Randy
Quaid) and the million dollars they plan to rob from a bank.
The robbery is successful (and involves an ingenious escape
ruse); the escape is not. As the novice criminals attempt to
flee the city, they are beset by every imaginable obstacle:
thieves, angry apartment sublessees, unhelpful construction
workers, the mob, and taxi drivers who don't speak English.
Few of these exaggerated cameos make the leap from script to
screen. The co-directors find their way only with Philip
Bosco's marvelous transformation of a rule-obsessed bus
driver into a comic gem.
   Mostly the film makers founder as they try to meld their
wayward humor with inane convention. Jason Robards gamely
marches through the role of the police chief pursuing the
robbers, looking less and less enthused as he trudges ahead.
Nothing exemplifies the picture's failings more than the
music, the forced energy of which brings to mind a certain
kind of television cop show -- "Mannix," not "Hill Street
Blues."

   VIDEO TIP: Messrs. Murray and Franklin may have benefited
from watching, and watching again, "After Hours," Martin
Scorsese's vision of all the things that can go wrong in a
single night in New York. Mr. Scorsese's tale of a yuppie
stranded in SoHo was a wisp of a story blown up into
something wild and exciting by a director who knew what he
was doing.
