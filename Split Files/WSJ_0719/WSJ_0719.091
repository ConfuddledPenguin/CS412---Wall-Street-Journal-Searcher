   NEW YORK -- In a deal that could trigger the latest round
of inflation in the movie business, Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc. unit has reportedly agreed to pay
$6 million for the services of the team of star director
Richard Donner and his wife, producer Lauren Shuler Donner.
   According to executives familiar with the transaction,
Columbia offered Mr. Donner $5 million to direct the movie
"Radio Flyer," and an additional $1 million producer fee for
Mrs. Shuler Donner. As reported, Columbia last month halted
production on the movie and fired the previous director, just
a few weeks into production.

   A Columbia spokesman declined comment. Mr. Donner, through
an assistant, would say only that he is working on "The Last
Boy Scout," a movie for producer David Geffen and Warner
Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc. People close to Mr. Donner
said he is trying to juggle both projects and hasn't formally
signed his agreement with Columbia.
   Executives at rival studios said "Radio Flyer," which
started out as a modestly budgeted movie, is likely to become
considerably pricier if Mr. Donner, as expected, begins
making changes in the screenplay and cast. Because production
was shut down, they note, Columbia must effectively start
from scratch.
   Although most of the industry inflation had been in movie
star salaries until recently, the price tags for directors,
writers and producers have been ratcheting upward lately,
too, despite mounting concern in the movie business that
costs are out of control. Screenplays that went for $300,000
last year are fetching $1 million.
   But industry executives say Mr. Donner's fee appears to
set a new high for a director, though some directors get
higher fees if they also produce and write. Recently, "Die
Hard 2" director Renny Harlin made news when Carolco Pictures
Inc. agreed to pay him $3 million for his next directing job.
   Mr. Donner, whose company has headquarters at Warner, has
a number of projects in the works for that studio, in
addition to "The Last Boy Scout." Warner executives said they
didn't expect that or any other current projects to be
directly affected by Mr. Donner's move.
   Mrs. Shuler Donner has been involved in producing the
films "Ladyhawke" "St. Elmo's Fire," "Mr. Mom" and "Three
Fugitives."
   "Radio Flyer" is the story of two young brothers who
escape into their fantasy worlds to cope with a harsh life
and abuse by their stepfather. Among its cast are Rosanna
Arquette and Joe Mantegna.
