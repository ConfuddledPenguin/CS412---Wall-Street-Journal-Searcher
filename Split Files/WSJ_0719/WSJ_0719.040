   Monday, July 23, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "Lost Man's River: An
Everglades Journey With Peter Matthiessen." A trip through
crocodile country with the aging but still springy novelist,
naturalist and student of Zen. The natural lore of island and
swampland is fascinating, a good deal more so than Mr.
Matthiessen's philosophic reflections on life. Indeed, our
guide's many admonitions on living in the present, the
importance of seizing the moment, and various sub-Buddhist
babblings make something of a swamp all by themselves. Still,
it is worth paddling through to get to the reptiles, and to
gather potentially useful information such as how best to
kill a large alligator -- plug him dead in the eye.

   Monday, July 23, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT: "Rising Son." A
grim saga assaying an assault on the ever-fashionable theme
of corporate greed. Set in the early '80s, it deals with
joblessness and factory closings, and, with equal grimness, a
conflict between an overambitious father and his son. Thick
with denunciations of slimy corporate types in suits who are
selling out the honest workers, and also the nation's future,
this talky enterprise is rescued by Brian Dennehy in the role
of the Willy Loman-like father. The naked steals from "Death
of a Salesman" are hard to miss and also hard to take, as is
the relentless propagandizing. Still, thanks mostly to Mr.
Dennehy, there are long, absorbing patches between the
preachments.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, July 23, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "You're the Top:
The Cole Porter Story." This "American Masters" segment is a
treat for lovers of Porter songs and musicals. It's also a
far cry from Hollywood's version of the Cole Porter story, in
which Cary Grant played the songwriter. Anything but Cary
Grant-like in appearance, Porter was a small, pop-eyed man
from a rich family whose taste for luxurious living was
legendary among his friends. The treat includes some
first-class stories about the making of "Kiss Me Kate" and
anecdotes by Bob Hope, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Cyd
Charisse. You also get to hear Fred Astaire singing "I Want
All of You" and Alfred Drake doing "Where Is the Life That
Once I Led," along with others belting standards such as
"Night and Day" and "I Get a Kick Out of You," in between
historical segments about how they were composed. The music
is wonderful, the personal data tragic. Who could ask for
anything more?
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, July 24, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Salesman."
Albert Maysles's classic documentary about four door-to-door
Bible salesmen. This black-and-white film from the early '60s
is airing on television for the first time and it is an event
not to be missed. The unobtrusive camera and microphones
record everything -- the bullying and pep talks of the sales
manager, who tells his troops, "the best seller in the world
is the Bible . . . the money is out there"; the anxiety
etched in the salesmen's faces; the motel rooms; the awful
conviviality of the sales pitch. It is the drama of ordinary
life such as it is rarely seen on American television or for
that matter the movies.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, July 25, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Fox: "Glory Days." A
new six-week series about the coming of age of four young men
with varying neurotic and spiritual problems. Here too, we
have a father-son conflict, at least in this first episode,
along with a rich assortment of platitudes about false
values, etc. But some of the characters are sharply drawn,
and the dialogue often is quirkily interesting.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, July 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on U.S.A.: "Snow-Kill"
is about five business executives who run afoul of murderous
outlaws while on a jaunt to the wintry mountains of the
Pacific Northwest. In the spirit of those "Outward Bound"
expeditions conceived by management psychologists as a means
of helping to build corporate teamwork, the executives go
forth to the wilderness to find their true selves. Alas,
while they are out hunting themselves up, they also find
mayhem and gore. This made-for-TV movie is not going to
enhance the status of those wilderness seminars. It does,
however, deserve credit for a fair approximation of the kind
of psychobabble being dished out in the corporate world. The
excellent David Dukes is happily almost unrecognizable under
mustache and hair as the murderous stalker.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, July 29, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Arts &amp; Entertainment:
"No Time to Say Goodbye." A distinguished BBC import,
haunting and elegiac, but also hard-edged in its probing. In
1938, England allowed the entry of 10,000 Jewish children
fleeing the Nazis. For nearly all, the farewells at the
station were the last the children would ever see of their
parents. Its forthrightness and its psychological complexity
are unrivaled among television war memoirs of this kind.
