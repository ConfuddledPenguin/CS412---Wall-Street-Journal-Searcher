   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc., trying to defuse a
heated proxy battle, said it would expand its board to 13
from 10 and give a seat to dissident shareholder Centaur
Partners.
   But there's a catch. The offer is contingent on the
company winning the proxy fight next week against Centaur.
Moreover, the Centaur director would be named only to a
one-year term.

   National Intergroup directors voted the plan at a special
meeting yesterday. One new director would be chosen from
Centaur's slate and a second director would be selected from
a list compiled with the advice of the company's
institutional stockholders. The third seat would go to Robert
King, president of FoxMeyer Drug, the company's wholesale
drug-distribution unit. Mr. King has been tapped to succeed
Howard M. Love, National Intergroup's chairman, when Mr. Love
steps down early next year.
   While Centaur's director would have only a one-year term,
Mr. King would be a director for three years and the
institutional representative for two years.
   Centaur, in a statement, said it views National
Intergroup's move as "a blatant, last-minute attempt to buy
institutional support for their nominees."
   Centaur rebuffed another board seat offer about a month
ago, according to a National Intergroup executive. Centaur
Partners, along with another dissident group, Walker Street
Associates, owns 25% of National Intergroup and is seeking to
elect three directors at the shareholder meeting on
Wednesday.
   This marks the second major move by National Intergroup to
appease investors who have grown steadily impatient with the
company's poor performance. Last month, the company said Mr.
Love would step down as top executive and all operations,
except FoxMeyer, would be sold.
   While radical, those moves failed to appease Centaur. The
group, urging a complete liquidation, noted that National
Intergroup has had losses from continuing operations for
seven years in a row. It also has questioned whether the
company's proposed restructuring would result in shareholder
dividends and why the board awarded Mr. Love a $300,000 bonus
in 1990 and granted him options to buy 325,000 shares of
stock at $16.80 each.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, National Intergroup closed at $17.625, off 50
cents, on volume of 93,600 shares.
   The two sides have been fighting since January. Centaur
wanted to increase the size of the board to 15 and elect
eight directors, effectively seizing control of the company.
Although 54% of stockholders, including Centaur, backed the
plan, it was defeated because an 80% majority is needed to
amend bylaws.
