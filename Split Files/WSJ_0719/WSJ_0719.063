   Boston -- In a small, windowless room somewhere inside
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), two men in pale blue lab
coats and plastic gloves hoisted a 3.4-foot roll of film onto
an oversized steel roller. An infrared light shone from the
black ceiling, and the accordion-like pleats of an immense
bellows folded out from one of the black walls.
   "You're inside the bellows of a camera," said Peter Bass,
Polaroid senior technical specialist, as he reached for the
light switch.

   An image of peasants walking on a country road amid fields
and swaying poplars flashed across the darkened room, hitting
the long sheet of film the technicians had lowered in the
dark. Whirring rollers sandwiched the exposed negative
against a sheet of printing paper, bursting a long
aluminum-coated tube of processing chemicals. And just 105
seconds later, Mr. Bass pulled back the top sheet of a
life-size snapshot of Ivan Shishkin's "Midday in Moscow
Countryside."
   Mr. Shishkin's painting is hidden from public view in
Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. But its photographic replica,
which duplicates every dab of color, brush stroke and crack,
soon will grace a select number of museum gift shops and
retail stores. With a handsome gilt-embossed frame and a
coyly calculated retail price of $998, this oversized
snapshot is being touted as the next best thing to owning a
real artwork.
   Invented in 1976 as a show-stopper for an annual
shareholders' meeting, Polaroid's room-sized camera has long
been used to record conservation work on rare paintings and
tapestries. Now the camera is being teamed with computer
imaging technology to mass produce replicas of popular
masterpieces.
   "Imagine having the opportunity to own and actually live
with works of proven importance by artists such as Monet,
Cezanne, Sargent, Homer and more," Polaroid's "Museum Replica
Collection" catalog enthuses, amid pages of photo
reproductions priced from $110 to $1,955. "Chosen . . . for
their ability to fit comfortably into your home or office
environment."
   The process works like this: Take your Monet or your Homer
and photograph it with a large-format camera. Run that
photograph through a computer scanner, which digitizes the
image into microscopic points called pixels (1.5 millionth of
an inch) that are color-coded to create a new image that will
translate accurately on Polaroid film. A digital record of
this image is stored on a 20-inch, 300-megabyte computer
disc. Meanwhile, an 8-by-10 transparency of the new
color-calibrated image is whisked off to the room-sized
camera, framed in front of the lens and snapped, with any
color discrepancies corrected by tinted gels. The final
product -- life-size, provided the original picture is no
larger than the camera's 40-by-80-inch focal plane -- is
sprayed with a "protectant" that also cuts the glossiness of
the print, which is then mounted and framed. The result: a
photograph that reproduces the colors and textures of a
painting so closely that it almost looks three-dimensional.
   Of course, some paintings "replicate" better than others.
Van Gogh's "The Sea at Saintes-Maries" ($480) looks a lot
like the painting it pretends to be, thanks to heavy brush
strokes and thick applications of paint that created shadows
when the painting was photographed. But Renoir's "The Actress
Jeanne Samary" ($495), with its delicate pastels, is flat and
unconvincing.
   The models for the more than 100 replicas available in
this country are almost exclusively from the collection of
the Museum of Fine Arts, with recent additions from Moscow's
Tretyakov Gallery and Pushkin Museum. The museums receive a
royalty fee, and the MFA also sells many of the replicas in
its own gift shop. Francois Poulet, general manager of the
museum's retail operations, said the shop netted nearly
$50,000 from replicas sold in conjunction with the museum's
Monet exhibition last winter.
   Other American museums are slowly following suit.
Replicated images from the Pushkin Museum now are on sale at
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. And the Art Institute
of Chicago recently allowed some of its paintings to be
replicated -- on the condition that the replicas be sold
outside the country only.
   But not every museum director is eager to hawk these
framed facsimiles. Kirk Varnedoe of New York's Museum of
Modern Art balked at the idea. "We sell slides for
educational purposes, we sell books . . . (but) the market
for decorative replicas; we haven't felt that it was our
business to get into," he said. "It's one of the tough jobs
that a museum has in front of it, to value the original
object, to insist on discrimination between that which almost
is and that which really is. The risk here is that the museum
seems to be the agent of blurring that distinction."
   In a move that may further blur that distinction, Polaroid
now is inviting museums to move the replicas right into their
own galleries. Norma Pasekoff of Polaroid Corp.'s replica
division recently visited the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C., to promote the "potential uses" of replicas
in "traveling exhibitions, for broadening exhibitions, {as
substitutes for} works that are missing," she said.
   "With today's technology, it is the closest to the real
thing you can get," said Ms. Pasekoff. "When you think you
can see every brush stroke and every crack, yes, it's art.
It's not original, but it's art."
   She makes a passionate case, but Mr. Varnedoe isn't having
any of it. "Oil on canvas takes light differently than does
Polaroid die on coated paper," he said. "The painted surface
is composed of matte and glossy, dry and oily . . . they are
the vocabulary in which the artist worked, and they don't
translate when everything comes down to a coat of
photographic emulsion on paper."
   But Polaroid is betting that for art lovers intent on
owning a dandy copy of their favorite Picasso or Degas, such
considerations may not matter. The camera and film company
now is taking special requests for replicas, provided that
the owner or museum in question agrees. Mike Murray, a
general manager for Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash., has
been hooked on Leon Augustin L'Hermitte's "Friend of the
Humble" ever since he saw a copy of the 1892 religious
painting hanging in a friend's house in 1975. Fortunately for
Mr. Murray, the real thing -- which he has never actually
seen -- is in the MFA's storage room.
   "It had personal significance to me, and I've always
thought it would be nice to have a copy of that print in my
home someday," Mr. Murray said. "What I may do is have
smaller prints made for my children."
   For G. Peabody Gardner Jr., former director of development
at the Museum of Fine Arts, the replica process seemed a good
way of filling in a few gaps in the family picture gallery.
In one case, the gap was left by a portrait of Mr. Gardner's
great grandfather, George P. Gardner, by Swedish artist
Anders Zorn, which had been donated to the museum years ago.
   "You don't pretend it's an original painting by Zorn; it
nevertheless does meet you halfway," Mr. Gardner said. "It
doesn't really look cheap, if you put it in a nice frame."
   Perhaps Mr. Zorn, who died in 1920, would have liked the
idea of such machine-generated replicas of his work.
Certainly it appealed to Mario Fernandez. This artist, known
for his sweeping paintings of nature and wildlife, sees the
photos as a colorful -- and lucrative -- new art form. He
recently ordered up 30 replicas of one of his paintings, and
plans to enhance each one with a different painted detail.
Every "unique" will cost $6,500.
   "At a certain point in the market, pricewise, people are
looking for something more exclusive . . . than off-set
lithography," Mr. Fernandez said. "If you only have 10 copies
of {an artwork}, you know it's going to be priced at a level
that is going to increase your presence in the market, your
reputation, everything else."
   But for artist Larry Rivers, photo replicas are just the
latest twist in art reproduction. "It's nothing that Polaroid
dreamt up, they're just reproductions and maybe they're
pretty good," Mr. Rivers said. Besides, Polaroid replicas may
be just the thing for some art lovers, he conceded: "Some
people can buy Mercedes Benzes -- but a lot of people buy
Chevrolets. They're not unhappy."
