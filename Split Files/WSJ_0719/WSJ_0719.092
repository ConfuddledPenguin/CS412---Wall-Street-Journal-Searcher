   Kerr-McGee said it will report a $35 million after-tax
loss on the sale, but the company didn't say when it would
post the loss. A company spokesman said he couldn't
immediately elaborate on the news release issued late
yesterday.
   The company said assets of the division include three
chemical processing facilities in Trona, Calif., that produce
soda ash, sodium sulfate, potash and boron products. The
division has 1,100 employees and had 1989 sales of $200
million.
