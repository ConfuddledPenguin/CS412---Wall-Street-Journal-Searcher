   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved broadly lower as inflation
jitters further unsettled a market already pressured by
disappointments in second-quarter earnings reports.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surpassed 3000
during each of the previous three sessions and ended both
Monday and Tuesday at 2999.75, headed lower at the opening
and never mounted a serious challenge to that level. The
average closed 18.07 lower at 2981.68.

   Declining stocks topped advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,030 to 483, and broader market indexes fared
substantially worse than the industrial average for the
second consecutive session.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, recorded
the equivalent of a 24-point loss in the 30-stock average by
falling 3.30 to 364.22. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index
lost 3.16 to 338.19, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 1.66 to 198.83.
   The market's initial setback followed news that consumer
prices went up 0.5% in June, a sharper rise than generally
expected. Analysts said the increase reduced the chances that
the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy further; in
testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said
the rise was "higher than we would like to see."
   Although prices rebounded briefly as Mr. Greenspan held
out the possibility that the central bank would nonetheless
consider taking additional steps to loosen credit, the
rebound was thwarted by a wave of sell programs linked to the
Chicago Board of Trade's futures on the Major Market Index.
   Index-arbitrage buying that involved the MMI, a 20-stock
measure designed to mirror the Dow industrials, had spurred a
late recovery in the market Tuesday. Following the reversal
of that move, stocks spent the rest of the session at lower
levels.
   Big Board volume totaled 168,760,000 shares, down from
176,790,000 Tuesday, as the flow of companies' second-quarter
results continued to dictate a large chunk of market
activity.
   "People are intolerant of bad (earnings) reports, but by
and large they're not leaving the market," said Peter Canelo,
an investment strategist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Instead, he
said, investors are moving out of stocks where earnings
aren't meeting forecasts and putting their assets to work in
other issues.
   With the industrial average having jumped about 3.8% in
four sessions before stalling close to 3000, Mr. Canelo said
the downturn didn't appear to be a sign of serious difficulty
ahead for the market. The 3000 mark represents "a
psychologically treacherous level, and it's to be expected
after a good rally that people would take some profits," he
said.
   Polaroid, which plummeted 3 1/4 to 36 on Big Board
composite volume of 1.3 million shares, became the latest
major casualty of an earnings disappointment. Its
second-quarter net income dropped 23% from a year ago, and
the company said it expects operating profit for the full
year to be flat to slightly lower.
   Other recent victims of earnings-related selling also fell
in active trading, including United Telecommunications, the
Big Board's most active issue for the second consecutive
session. The stock, which plunged 8 3/4 Tuesday as 11.8
million shares changed hands, went down another 2 1/4 to 27
1/4 on 10 million shares.
   GTE, second on the most-active list, slid 3/8 to 27 7/8 as
3.5 million shares were traded, while Lowe's fell 3 1/4 to 38
1/8 on 1.2 million shares and Computer Associates
International was unchanged at 9 1/2 on 1.8 million shares.
   Investors also bailed out of a number of growth stocks,
which have been strong performers for some time. Wal-Mart
Stores dropped 1 3/4 to 33 3/4 on 2.9 million shares, Waste
Management tumbled 1 1/4 to 42 3/4 on 1.6 million shares,
Procter &amp; Gamble lost 3/4 to 89, Boeing fell 3/4 to 59 1/2
and Home Depot dropped 2 to 39 5/8.
   AMR, whose second-quarter net income fell 27% from a year
ago, retreated 2 7/8 to 61 5/8. First Boston lowered its 1990
and 1991 earnings projections on the parent of American Air
and several other airline companies; Delta Air Lines dropped
2 3/8 to 73 and USAir Group lost 5/8 to 24 3/4.
   But UAL, which owns United Airlines, rose 1/2 to 162 1/2.
Nonunion workers at United decided to support the $4.38
billion buy-out proposed by the unions representing pilots,
machinists and flight attendants.
   Upjohn climbed 2 3/8 to 43 7/8 on 2.2 million shares amid
renewed takeover rumors, focusing on a possible bid from
American Home Products, which fell 2 1/8 to 52 1/4. Upjohn,
which has previously said it isn't for sale, declined to
comment on the latest speculation. American Home and
Britain's Glaxo Holdings, another rumored suitor, also
declined to comment.
   Eli Lilly skidded 3 7/8 to 85 on 1.6 million shares as a
lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York drew attention to
accusations that the anti-depressant drug Prozac, which the
company markets, induces thoughts of suicide in some users.
   Pfizer rose 2 to 71 1/4 as 1.3 million shares changed
hands. PaineWebber upgraded its investment rating on the
stock to "attractive" from "neutral" and increased its 1990
and 1991 earnings estimates; analyst Ronald Nordmann said the
"excellent quality" of the company's second-quarter earnings,
released Tuesday, prompted those moves.
   Reebok International dropped 5/8 to 15 3/4 on 2.3 million
shares. Although second-quarter earnings rose 6.5% from a
year ago, earnings per share of 38 cents were on the lower
end of analysts' expectations; Montgomery Securities
downgraded its investment rating on the stock Tuesday.
Separately, Reebok called off its contract negotiations with
pop singer Madonna, who was to star in a new ad campaign.
   Whitman, whose second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations dropped 26%, fell 7/8 to 26 1/8. Separately, Sanyo
Electric of Japan denied a report that it submitted the
highest bid for the company's Hussmann unit.
   U.S. Shoe slid 2 1/4 to 22 1/4. McDonald &amp; Co. analyst
Joffrey S. Stein said he expects earnings for the company's
LensCrafters division to be flat to lower for its second
quarter, ending this month.
   Other issues battered by earnings-related sell-offs
included Fedders, which plunged 2 1/2 to 12 7/8; Great Lakes
Chemical, which dropped 3 to 63 1/4, and Square D, which
tumbled 2 5/8 to 56.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.33
to 362.06. Volume totaled 11,490,000 shares.
