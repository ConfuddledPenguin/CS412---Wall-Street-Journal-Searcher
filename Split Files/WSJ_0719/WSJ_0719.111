   AmeriTrust Corp., reeling from bad loans, said
second-quarter net plunged 39%, and the Cleveland-based bank
holding company indicated that the problems could increase
further during the third quarter.
   AmeriTrust attributed its second-quarter decline to higher
provisions for loan losses and an increase in other expenses.
The bank earned $18.4 million, or 45 cents a share, compared
with year-earlier results of $30.3 million, or 83 cents a
share.

   AmeriTrust also announced a plan to exercise greater care
in making loans. The move is a response to bank regulators'
assessment of the company and to concerns of management and
board members.
