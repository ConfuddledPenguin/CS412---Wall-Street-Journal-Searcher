   Bamberger Polymers Inc. said it secured a temporary
restraining order against 11 former sales and marketing
employees, who, it said, are starting a competing plastics
business.
   Bamberger, a New Hyde Park, N.Y., plastics merchant,
earlier this week said loss of the employees would have a
"material adverse effect" on its sales and earnings from the
Northeast and West Coast operations in the third quarter.

   The order restrains the former employees from operating a
plastics business.
   Walter Craig, legal counsel for Helm Resources Inc., a
holding company that controls about half of Bamberger, said
the defecting workers are "engaged in basically the same
business they were involved in, the trading and sale of
thermoplastic resins." Mr. Craig said that Bamberger suspects
another company provided the workers financial backing.
   The company also is seeking damages against the former
employees in a proceeding in New York state Supreme Court in
Nassau County. A request for a preliminary injunction will be
considered Tuesday.
   None of the defendants could be reached for comment.
