   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Stable imports and slipping exports
caused Brazil's trade surplus to shrink 32% to $1.15 billion
in June from a year earlier, the Federal Trade Bureau said.
   Exports totaled $2.5 billion f.o.b., which means the
seller agrees to put an item on a transportation vehicle at
no charge, but the buyer pays the actual transportation
costs. The figure was down from $3.23 billion in May. Imports
were $1.35 billion f.o.b., down from $1.5 billion last month.

   The trade surplus accumulated over the past 12 months
reached $13.26 billion f.o.b., down from $19.52 billion
f.o.b. registered in the previous 12 months.
