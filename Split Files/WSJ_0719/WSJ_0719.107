   Wavetek Corp. posted disappointing fiscal third-quarter
profit and said it retained a financial adviser to explore
various options to maximize shareholder value, including a
possible sale of the San Diego company.
   John F. Kessler, chief executive officer, said
"operational results weren't adequate" although net income
more than doubled to $515,000, or six cents a share, in the
June 30 period from $234,000, or three cents a share. Revenue
rose 9% to $22.9 million from $21 million.

   Pretax earnings of $522,000 were about half of what the
company had hoped for, Mr. Kessler said. New orders in the
quarter fell to $17.4 million from $23.7 million in the
year-ago period. He said the main problem is erosion in
demand for the company's electronic test-and-measurement
equipment, which accounts for about 60% of sales.
   Mr. Kessler said Wavetek expects to dismiss about 100
people, or about 10% of its work force, by the end of the
week, reflecting the company's lowered sales and profit
expectations. After the cuts, the company will have 850 to
900 employees.
   Wavetek retained Peers &amp; Co., a Chicago investment banking
concern, to assist it in arranging a "strategic alliance" or
sale of the company.
   Wavetek closed yesterday at $4.25, up 37.5 cents, in
over-the-counter trading.
