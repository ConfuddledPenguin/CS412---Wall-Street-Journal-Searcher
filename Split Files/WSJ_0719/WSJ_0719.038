   NEW YORK -- Citicorp said it will soon disclose details of
a plan to curb out-of-line expenses in its North American
corporate banking operations.
   The nation's largest bank didn't provide any further
information, but analysts said it is almost certain that such
expense reductions will result in layoffs.

   Thomas Jones, executive vice president for financial
control, told analysts that "expenses are going up too much
for the level of business" in North America. "We'll be
bringing that in line."
   Mr. Jones said the problems in Citicorp's North American
business stem mostly from the reduced level of corporate
mergers and acquisitions and from the cost of credit.
   James McDermott, a banking analyst and executive vice
president of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said that any
effort to significantly reduce expense growth would almost
certainly involve layoffs. "The thing is, I have no idea what
dimension they're talking about."
   He said that a comprehensive expense control effort
presumably would also involve "a review of business lines and
decisions about where they want to operate and in what
fashion."
   Other money center banks already have announced plans to
restructure their corporate business to reflect the lower
volume of business since the leveraged buy-out and merger and
acquisition binge of the late 1980s dried up.
