   The partnership that controls Great American Management &amp;
Investment Inc. agreed to sell an 18% Great American stake,
for $50 million, to two investment funds affiliated with the
investment-banking partnership of Hellman &amp; Friedman.
   Great American, Chicago, has interests in manufacturing,
real estate, financial services, agricultural chemicals and
fertilizers. Investor Sam Zell serves as chairman, chief
executive officer and president. Along with the estate of the
recently deceased Robert Lurie, Mr. Zell controls Great
American through a partnership known as Equity Holdings Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, the partnership controlled by Mr.
Zell will sell the Hellman &amp; Friedman funds two million
common shares, at $25 each. The sale will trim the Equity
Holdings stake to 74% from 92%; the publicly traded portion
of Great American shares will be unchanged at about 4.5%,
with the remainder in the hands of other Great American
insiders.
   Great American has approximately 11.1 million common
shares outstanding.
