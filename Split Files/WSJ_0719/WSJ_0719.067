   NEW YORK -- Simon says buy-outs are back.
   After four years of sitting on the sidelines of the
leveraged buy-out field that made him millions, William E.
Simon is getting ready to re-enter the game. This time, he
will do it with a money chest provided by a Japanese
insurance company and what he expects will be a "club" of
other big investors from the U.S., Asia and Europe.

   Mr. Simon and partner Gerald L. Parsky said that Tokio
Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. of Tokyo has invested $100
million in a partnership formed to take over all of the
Simon-Parsky investment projects, except those involving
savings and loan associations.
   In turn, the new partnership, WSGP Partners, hopes to
raise a pool of at least an additional $300 million from a
group of no more than 10 pension funds, insurers and other
institutions world-wide. This fund will target medium-sized
companies for friendly takeovers, including some overseas. It
also will invest in real estate ventures.
   The investment by Tokio Marine, the world's largest
property and casualty insurer, reflects the continuing hunger
of Japanese financial institutions for U.S. deal-making and
money-management skills. Most big Japanese brokerage firms,
insurers and commercial banks have formed links with U.S.
investment firms, either by buying stakes or setting up joint
ventures.
   Tokio Marine itself paid $42 million last year for a 10%
stake in Delaware Management Holdings Inc., a
Philadelphia-based money management firm. Wilshire Associates
of Santa Monica, Calif., served as investment adviser to
Tokio Marine in taking both the Delaware Management and
Simon-Parsky stakes.
   For Mr. Simon, a former Treasury secretary, the new
partnership ends an absence from the leveraged buy-out arena,
when he and Mr. Parsky concentrated on S&amp;L and real estate
investments for several years. Mr. Simon helped spark the
buy-out boom of the 1980s with his hugely profitable buy-out
and resale of Gibson Greetings Cards Inc. in 1982-83. He
dropped out of the field when he believed skyrocketing deal
prices no longer made buy-outs attractive.
   This may change, with the demise of the high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond market and companies'
running into trouble because of debt-heavy balance sheets,
according to Messrs. Parsky and Simon. "We both believe that
realistic prices are coming and that there will be
opportunity for acquisitions from some of the overleveraged
{buy-out} transactions" done by others, Mr. Parsky said.
   Deals financed by the WSGP buy-out fund will probably
involve as much as 30% equity, compared with as little as 5%
or 10% in the heyday of the highly leveraged buy-outs. The
fund itself might provide 10% of the equity for a particular
investment, while fund investors would get the option to
supply the remainder directly, as well as get first crack at
financing the debt for the deal, Mr. Parsky said.
   Tokio Marine declined to disclose terms of its investment
pact with Messrs. Simon and Parsky. Mr. Parsky said the
insurer received a minority stake and won't be involved in
running the partnership, though the company will be active in
helping set investment strategies.
   At $300 million, the WSGP Partners buy-out fund would be
tiny, compared with such behemoths as the $5.6 billion
leveraged buy-out pool raised by Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts &amp;
Co. But the "investment club" approach for the new fund would
greatly expand its buying power because participants could
elect to invest more money on a deal-by-deal basis.
   This added degree of control could appeal to big pension
funds, which were criticized by politicians during the
buy-out boom for getting locked into controversial takeovers.
   Mr. Parsky said the fund will target companies and
divisions with purchase prices of $300 million to $2 billion.
He said the fund isn't aimed at investing in troubled
companies but will be in the market for operations being
divested by cash-strapped companies.
   In real estate, the fund will shun downtown "trophy"
buildings in favor of buying less-visible properties, perhaps
from banks and thrifts paring their portfolios. About $800
million in commercial and residential properties, mostly in
Southern California and assembled by Messrs. Parsky and Simon
through earlier partnerships, won't be transferred to WSGP
Partners. But all new real estate purchases will be made
through the new partnership, Mr. Parsky said.
   He said that while the buy-out fund will be WSGP's main
focus, the partnership with Tokio Marine hopes to raise a
series of investment funds. Another one aimed at attracting
pension funds as investors will put money into companies
owned or being taken over by minority executives.
   The new buy-out fund won't invest in S&amp;Ls, an area in
which Messrs. Parsky and Simon remain active and for which
they continue to try to attract pension funds as investors
for a separate investment pool. Mr. Parsky said Tokio Marine
"wasn't interested" in getting involved in S&amp;L investments.
   The Simon-Parsky group, as previously reported, last year
made a proposal to the Los Angeles County Employees
Retirement Association and other big pension systems to form
an S&amp;L acquisition fund. This plan stalled, but Mr. Parsky
said he and Mr. Simon recently presented a new proposal to
potential investors, including the Los Angeles County fund
and the California Public Employees Retirement System.
   The new plan involves setting up the proposed fund using
Marina Del Rey, Calif.-based Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association, owned by the Simon-Parsky group, as a vehicle to
buy other thrifts. The initial plan called for the fund to
start buying thrifts from scratch. Mr. Parsky said the
pension funds and their consultants haven't responded to the
revised proposal yet.
