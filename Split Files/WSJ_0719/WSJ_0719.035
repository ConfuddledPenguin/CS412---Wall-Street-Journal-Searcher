   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission sued to block
Arco Chemical Co.'s $220 million acquisition of certain
business lines from Union Carbide Corp.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, seeks an
injunction stopping the sale and rescinding the agreement on
antitrust grounds. The agreement provided for the sale to
Arco Chemical of two Carbide chemical lines.

   The FTC authorized its staff to file the suit last month.
But at the time Arco Chemical held out hope that antitrust
issues could still be resolved through negotiation. The
company, based in Newton Square, Pa., has already made full
payment to Carbide, and both companies say the payment is
nonrefundable under the terms of their agreement.
   The FTC has declined to comment on whether the
court-ordered rescission it is seeking would entail the
return of Arco's payment.
   In any case, the agreement provides that Arco Chemical has
rights to proceeds from a subsequent sale of the Carbide
assets to a third party. Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn.,
still operates the businesses at issue.
   Arco Chemical is 83% owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., Los
Angeles, although Arco Chemical's stock trades separately.
   Both companies issued statements saying they believe their
positions will be upheld in court. An FTC spokeswoman
declined to comment.
