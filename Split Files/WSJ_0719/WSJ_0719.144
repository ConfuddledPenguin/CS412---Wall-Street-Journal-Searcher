   WASHINGTON -- The budget talks suffered a setback as a
White House meeting with top lawmakers failed to produce any
tangible results, and House Republicans overwhelmingly voted
to oppose raising any taxes to shrink the deficit.
   Top congressional Democrats said they agreed with
President Bush to strive for a fiscal 1991 deficit-reduction
accord in the next month, but they provided no reason for
optimism.

   "No startling decisions were made," House Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) said after the White House session.
   Mr. Foley said Democrats complained to the president about
a resolution approved yesterday by House Republicans that
opposes "new taxes and all tax rate increases as a means of
reducing the federal budget deficit."
   The speaker said it was "unfortunate" that Republicans
"approved a statement that repudiates the president," but
added that it wouldn't derail the summit. Other Democrats
gave harsher assessments. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said, "It certainly will
have a chilling effect on how the Democrats approach the
summit." Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,
Texas), referring to the House Republicans, said, "Those
people are living in a dream world."
   Mr. Bush said he asked White House Budget Director Richard
Darman to continue talks with House Majority Leader Dick
Gephardt (D., Mo.) during the next few days. The budget
summit hasn't met for a week, but Mr. Gephardt said he may
convene a session as early as today. Congressional leaders
are to meet again with Mr. Bush on Monday, the White House
said.
   In the budget summit, negotiators are seeking a package of
tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit by
about $50 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Democrats have been working on a tax package in
anticipation that the administration will soon offer one of
its own. Both the Democrats and the administration are
looking closely at a broad-based energy tax, particularly one
that levies a flat percentage on the prices of all types of
fuel.
   Rep. Rostenkowski said in an interview with NBC News
yesterday that "there will be a general increase in energy
taxes." Sen. Bentsen also spoke favorably about the energy
tax, saying in an interview that it "does not
disproportionately hurt any single region." Sen. Bentsen said
some way would have to be found to offset the regressivity of
such a tax.
   Earlier, Bush administration officials had been pushing a
so-called British Thermal Unit tax, which would have been
levied on different energy sources based on the amount of
energy they produce. But that approach has been criticized as
too complicated and as especially burdensome to
coal-producing regions. Congressional staffs are exploring
ways to raise between $12 billion and $15 billion a year from
a price-based energy tax.
   Shortly after his meeting with congressional leaders, Mr.
Bush said aboard Air Force One: "The deficit problem is so
serious that there must be a bipartisan, responsible answer,
and I will keep saying that."
   But the House Republicans' resolution, drafted by Rep.
Richard Armey (R., Texas), singles out Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell (D., Maine) for having "abandoned the summit
goals and emerged as a consistent roadblock," and asserted
that he "has championed tax increases at every turn."
   Asked for his reaction, Sen. Mitchell smiled broadly and
said, "This is essentially a dispute between the House
Republicans and the president. I don't want to get involved."
The senator reiterated his position that any accord requires
support from a majority of both parties.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he urged Mr. Bush
and the Democrats not to let the vote by his rank-and-file
interfere with their objective. Another Republican budget
negotiator, Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, sought to play down
the significance of the vote, arguing, "All it says is that
Republicans oppose taxes. We've always opposed taxes."
   Separately, the Senate Budget Committee voted 20-1 in
favor of legislation offered by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.) that would exclude the Social Security surplus from the
calculation of the deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law. The
bill doesn't alter the deficit targets set in the law; Sen.
Hollings said that was up to the budget summit.
