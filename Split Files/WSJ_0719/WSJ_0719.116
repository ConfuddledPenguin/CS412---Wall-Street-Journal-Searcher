   H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of America,
said its second-quarter earnings increased 51% to $60.1
million, or 61 cents a share.
   The Los Angeles thrift holding company attributed the
results to strong growth in new mortgage loans, which totaled
a record $4.2 billion for the quarter.

   The growth is impressive because it comes at a time when
home sales are slowing and "generally mortgage lenders are
having trouble putting loans out the door," said Allan
Bortel, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co.
   Ahmanson's said its second-quarter nonperforming assets
increased by $51 million to $597 million, or 1.25% of total
assets. It also said that it may sell its real-estate
development operations because of new capital rules it said
will take effect by 1994.
   The thrift company's stock fell 12.5 cents to $21.875
yesterday.
