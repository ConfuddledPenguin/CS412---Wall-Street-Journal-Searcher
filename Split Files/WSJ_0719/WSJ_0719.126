   WASHINGTON -- After weeks of sometimes angry negotiations
and heated debate and despite a White House veto threat, the
Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
   The legislation, which was approved 65-34, would overturn
five 1989 Supreme Court decisions that made it more difficult
for victims of employment discrimination to win court cases.

   Though the bill said nothing in it should "be construed to
require an employer to adopt hiring or promotion quotas,"
President Bush and Senate Republicans insisted the measure
would result in businesses setting quotas to protect
themselves from litigation.
   "Quotas, schmotas," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.),
floor manager of the bill, adding that the "false cry of
quotas" is a "disreputable tactic by those who oppose full
civil rights" for women and minorities.
   He said there wasn't "one iota of evidence" that quotas
resulted from the law that was in place for 18 years before
the Supreme Court overruled it. The court's unanimous 1971
decision in what is commonly called the Griggs case placed
the burden of proof on employers to demonstrate the business
necessity of employment practices that work to exclude
minorities and women.
   That employer burden of proof would be restored by the
legislation. Under the bill, "the only way employers can
avoid costly lawsuits they are sure to lose" is to use
quotas, argued Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
   The language indicating the measure doesn't require quotas
is meaningless, a "feel-good provision," said Senate
Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas. "To assert that a
duck is not a duck does not transform a duck into a pigeon,"
he said.
   Another provision fought by Republicans would allow women
and members of certain religious groups who are victims of
intentional discrimination to sue for compensatory and, in
some cases, punitive damages. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) said he will try to have the bill's
final language, after House action, include a provision that
punitive damages couldn't exceed $150,000 or the amount of
the compensatory damages, whichever is greater. An amendment
to that effect wasn't voted on, for procedural reasons.
   The legislation also would prohibit lawsuits challenging
court-approved employment agreements except in certain cases
and would facilitate lawsuits against discriminatory
employment policies involving seniority systems.
   The affirmative vote fell two short of the two-thirds
necessary to override a presidential veto. Ralph Neas,
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, said negotiations with the White House will continue
as similar legislation is considered by the House.
   Mr. Neas, who lobbied strongly for the measure, said he
was confident "this bill will be enacted into law." He said,
"There will be a two-thirds bipartisan majority in both
houses."
   White House officials repeatedly have said Mr. Bush wants
to sign a civil rights bill, but one that wouldn't result in
quotas. For a Republican president, he is relatively popular
among black Americans, and he doesn't want to hurt that
standing.
   "No one wants to be branded, no matter how incorrectly,"
Sen. Hatch said, "with all the baggage that comes with a `no'
vote on a measure some claim is anti-discrimination."
