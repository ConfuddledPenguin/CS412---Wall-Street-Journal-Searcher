   Journalists who lie in their news reports -- and who do so
knowingly, deliberately, programmatically -- are not,
perhaps, as uncommon as the folklore of their trade would
sometimes have us believe. A comprehensive history of
reporters' prevarications about the major events of the
present century would make a fat and melancholy book. So
would a history of the rewards and acclaim that have often
been lavished on the most outrageous perpetrators of such
journalistic falsehood.
   Yet in any chronicle of calculated mendacity, a special
chapter would have to be reserved for Walter Duranty, the
infamous Moscow correspondent of the New York Times during
the height of Stalin's terror. He was said by Malcolm
Muggeridge, who knew Duranty in Moscow at the time, to be the
"greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of
journalism." Joseph Alsop concurred in this judgment --
"lying was his stock in trade," he said. History has amply
confirmed the truth of these charges, and now an excellent
biography of Duranty -- "Stalin's Apologist" (Oxford, 404
pages, $24.95) by S.J. Taylor -- recounts in lurid detail the
story of the writer who, against some very stiff competition,
won the distinction of lying the most, and most effectively,
about the worst of Stalin's crimes.

   He lied about the enforced famine in the Ukraine that
accompanied Stalin's collectivization of the peasants -- a
program that caused more deaths than Hitler's war against the
Jews. He lied about the Moscow Trials. He lied about the
terror, about the gulag, and about virtually every aspect of
Stalin's consolidation of power. And he did much of this
lying on the front pages of the New York Times, which
rewarded him for his efforts by making him one of the
highest-paid correspondents in the world. For this record of
lies, moreover, Duranty was given the Pulitzer Prize. As Ms.
Taylor -- an American writer now living in London --
correctly observes, in Duranty "the Western establishment
that feted him, no less than the Kremlin, had found their
man."
   To appreciate the enormity of Duranty's performance, it
has to be understood that he was neither the victim of
misinformation nor the dupe of some deeply held political
conviction. Not a communist himself -- nor, indeed, a
believer in much of anything but his own career, his
pleasures and his privileges -- Duranty simply held Stalin in
high esteem, and systematically withheld from his readers the
kind of information that would have cast doubt on the Soviet
dictator's benign objectives. "You can't make omelets without
cracking eggs," he liked to say.
   The man who harbored these views seems always to have
lived a dissolute and disorderly life. He was born in
Liverpool in 1884 into a middle-class family that lost its
money when Duranty was 15. He nonetheless managed to get to
Cambridge and then to Paris, where he soon fell in with
Aleister Crowley, a professional occultist known as "the
Beast," who specialized in organizing mystical orgies and
smoking opium. With Jane Cheron, Crowley's favorite Scarlet
Woman (as he called her), who also was an opium addict,
Duranty quickly formed what Ms. Taylor describes as "an
affable menage a trois: sex with one partner, drugs with the
other, a little magic on the side." Duranty later married
Cheron, with whom he established yet another menage a trois
with his Russian mistress in Moscow.
   It was in Paris, on the eve of World War I, that Duranty
made his first contributions to the Times, and by the end of
the war he was an important part of the paper's European
coverage, even though the Times had been warned that Duranty
was a shady character. His boss in the Paris bureau had
described him as "unreliable and tricky," and other judgments
were harsher.
   Yet the Times stuck with him for nearly two decades. His
energy, drive and intelligence -- for Duranty was a very
clever man -- made him seem a formidable journalistic talent,
and his sheer ruthlessness was a professional asset in an era
of fierce journalistic competition. In the '20s he had
guessed correctly that Stalin would be Lenin's successor, and
this gave him an authority that defeated every effort to
dislodge him from his post. He is even credited with coining
the term "Stalinism" (in 1931). For Duranty, it would remain
a term of praise to the end.
   As far as the Times was concerned, however, the end came
in 1940 when the paper shut down its Moscow bureau and fired
Duranty, who was at long last seen to be an embarrassment. He
was 56 and virtually penniless. None of his efforts to earn a
living as a writer or lecturer succeeded. Years of high
living and heavy drinking had ruined his health, and he was
soon existing on handouts from other journalists. When Stalin
died in 1953, he made the front page for the last time -- but
this time it was the front page of the Morning Sentinel in
Orlando, Fla., where he was living in penury. It was his last
opportunity to pay tribute to Stalin's "strength and
influence."
   Four years later he wrote to the Times begging for a
pension of $155 a month. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the
publisher, responded by writing a personal check for $2,500.
A month later Duranty died in the Orlando hospital. He was
73. About this despicable character Ms. Taylor has written a
book that is splendid in every respect but one: We never do
discover how it was that the Times tolerated this record of
mendacity for as long as it did. Perhaps she should make that
the subject of her next book.
