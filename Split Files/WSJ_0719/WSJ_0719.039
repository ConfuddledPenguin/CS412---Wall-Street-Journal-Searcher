   For lawyers, switching sides is easy -- and almost always
profitable.
   Nearly every day, a crime-busting prosecutor changes
allegiances and starts raking in big bucks representing
accused criminals. Often, too, a civil rights lawyer shows up
defending an alleged violator of civil rights, or an
environmental crusader is hired to fight back against the
environmentalists.

   Changing sides is perfectly legal, of course, and many
lawyers say it's also morally defensible in a legal system in
which lawyers are trained to argue any side of an issue with
equal fervor.
   But public-interest lawyers complain that their former
colleagues are unfairly exploiting what they learned on one
side of the fence to benefit clients on the other side. And
the phenomenon is starting to worry some lawyers who are
concerned about the legal profession's already shaky image.
They say lawyers who switch sides generate cynicism about
their commitment to their clients and lend credence to the
derisive label "hired gun."
   Jerry Jackson, for one, doesn't think the label fits. He
left the National Wildlife Federation in 1988, worked briefly
in government and then landed at one of the nation's largest
and most profitable law firms, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom. There, demand was increasing among corporate clients
for lawyers who could guide them through an increasingly
dense thicket of environmental laws and regulations. Mr.
Jackson says he believed that helping those corporations
could also benefit the environment.
   Only two months later, Mr. Jackson found himself pitted
against none other than the National Wildlife Federation in a
Florida case charging his client, a state water management
agency, with polluting the Everglades and a nearby wildlife
refuge. Mr. Jackson says he thinks even this role is
consistent with a commitment to the environment: "I don't
feel like my client's got a different goal from the National
Wildlife Federation as far as the Everglades are concerned,"
he says.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Jackson's former compatriots at the
Wildlife Federation disagree. "The only way we could force
them to initiate cleanup and to start taking some positive
actions was to file a lawsuit," says David White, the
federation lawyer assigned to the case.
   Mr. Jackson won't say how much money he has made by
switching to the private sector, but he concedes it is a
substantial sum. A lawyer on the staff of the National
Wildlife Federation makes about $45,000 annually; at a firm
the size of Skadden Arps, a starting associate with a few
years' public-sector experience can earn $150,000 or more.
Says Brad Hildebrandt of the legal consulting firm
Hildebrandt Inc., "It's quite easy to double or triple or
more your compensation by making that move if you are going
to a firm of any size."
   Mr. Jackson is hardly alone in failing to generate
understanding among his former colleagues. Charles Morgan,
former head of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Washington office, enraged many in the ACLU by building a
private practice defending clients like Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
against race and sex discrimination charges, and the New York
Power Authority in its effort to continue operating a nuclear
power plant near New York City.
   Mr. Morgan maintains that his change in clientele didn't
reflect any change in values; even at the ACLU, he says, he
never considered himself an "issues" lawyer. Instead, he
says, he took the view that a lawyer is the advocate for
whatever client comes his way.
   It's a philosophy that angers cause-oriented advocates --
and one that some public-interest lawyers claim is
disingenuous. Recalling Mr. Morgan's days as a civil rights
lawyer in the South, consumer activist Ralph Nader says,
"Nobody could have gone through what he went through and not
been a cause lawyer."
   Other lawyers who move into the private sector readily
acknowledge that their philosophies have, indeed, changed
over time. James Neal, a Nashville lawyer who prosecuted
Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa and Nixon Attorney General John
Mitchell, says he has had a change of heart since his days as
a federal prosecutor. "I was a zealot," he says, adding that
if he were ever to take on prosecution work again he would be
"more tempered."
   "I thought we would rid the world of all of its ills if we
put Jimmy Hoffa in jail," Mr. Neal says. But since then, he
laments, "the Teamster chieftains have gone from bad to
worse."
   To still-zealous prosecutors, Mr. Neal's list of clients
probably looks as though it has gone from bad to worse. He
took on Ford Motor Co.'s defense in the highly publicized
criminal trial over lethally defective Ford Pintos, and he is
defending Exxon from criminal charges tied to the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   Barbara Brown, who worked for a women's rights advocacy
group before joining the law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp;
Walker in Washington, D.C., says she has acquired a better
appreciation for corporations and their needs since she made
her move. Ms. Brown, who now defends companies faced with sex
discrimination charges, is unabashed about her new-felt
sympathies toward management. "I'm uncomfortable with a lot
of what I see as plaintiffs not willing to take
responsibility for their own careers," she says.
   Not all erstwhile public interest lawyers are quite as
happy with their decisions to head into the private sector.
Harrison Wellford, a former executive director of the Center
for Responsive Law who is now with a Washington, D.C., law
firm, says private practice can be frustrating because the
client's objectives set the parameters of the lawyer's work.
He says that means he often can't attack defects in the law
even when the problem adversely affects his client.
   But for most public interest lawyers who go behind enemy
lines, the decision to switch sides -- however agonizing
initially -- seems to bring few regrets. Indeed, many of
these lawyers argue that the public interest is in fact
better served when a lawyer's practice includes clients on
more than one side of a particular issue. "Cause" lawyers,
they say, often lack an adequate understanding of their
adversaries' positions, forcing the parties into rancorous,
costly lawsuits when more amicable resolutions might be
possible.
   Mr. Neal argues, for example, that lawyers who remain
prosecutors for too long often "become absolutely insensitive
to people in trouble." In an adversarial system, he says,
"it's unhealthy to become an issues lawyer."
