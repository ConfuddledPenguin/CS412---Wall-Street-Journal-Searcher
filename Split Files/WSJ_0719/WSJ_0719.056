   General Dynamics Corp. posted a second-quarter loss of
$240 million after taking a $450 million charge on the
delayed A-12 attack plane program.
   But its teammate on the Navy project, McDonnell Douglas
Corp., avoided taking such a charge and posted a $57 million
profit.

   Had McDonnell Douglas taken a charge plus an adjustment
for upgrades it's making on the T-45 Navy trainer jet, the
embattled defense contractor would have had a net loss of
$109 million. The company is filing claims against the
government for reimbursements it believes are due on those
programs; it included an estimate of the value of those
claims in its earnings report.
   General Dynamics is joining in the claims against the
Navy, but didn't include a provision for any possible
recoveries.
   Industry observers say McDonnell Douglas's more optimistic
approach, while an acceptable method of accounting, could
come back to haunt the nation's No. 1 defense contractor. "If
Douglas were truly honest, they'd know they're not going to
get a 100% adjustment from the Navy," said First Boston
Corp.'s Peter Aseritis. "Will they get half of that?
Possibly. Sixty percent? Possibly, but not likely."
   A Navy spokesman in Washington said the service "does
believe that the A-12 contract is solid and doesn't require
revision."
   Pentagon officials familiar with the issue said that
ultimately, Navy brass may agree to cover at least part of
the companies' claims because the A-12 is one of the
service's top-priority programs. "But the final shape of any
agreement is still hard to see," said one official.
   John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas's chairman, said that
"at this point, we do not believe we have losses inherent on
the program." He noted that the company chose its tack after
consulting with numerous outside auditing and legal experts.
   But the fact that General Dynamics chose a more
conservative outlook for the financial fate of the A-12
raises a question for investors: Whose vision of the future
is correct?
   Part of the difference between the methodologies used by
the firms, both based in St. Louis, reflects several factors:
General Dynamics has used a higher cost estimate for what it
will take to complete its portion of the plane; McDonnell
Douglas, which recently launched a cost-cutting drive, thinks
it can complete its share of the A-12 more cheaply than
General Dynamics has given it credit for; General Dynamics
has to reverse $24 million of earnings it had recorded on the
A-12 program, while McDonnell Douglas never booked any
expected profits; and McDonnell Douglas doesn't write down
any general and administrative expenses until they occur.
   General Dynamics's $450 million pretax charge on the A-12
included 50% of the company's current estimate of the team's
anticipated overruns from the $4.8 billion contract ceiling
and the fixed price of the initial production lot of planes.
McDonnell Douglas said its loss on the A-12, had it
registered one, would have been $89 million.
   Some analysts noted that McDonnell Douglas can ill-afford
to post a poor quarter now. The company, which earlier this
week said it will eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs this year,
recently negotiated an estimated $4 billion line of credit
whose terms are tied to the company's net worth. "If they'd
taken a similar write-off to what General Dynamics did, that
would have reduced the line of credit by about $600 million,"
said Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   McDonnell Douglas's $57 million net income was equal to
$1.49 a share, and included $16 million from the sale of the
company's computer-servicing business. A year earlier, the
company had a net loss of $48 million, or $1.25 a share.
Revenue rose 22% to $4.12 billion from $3.37 billion.
   Operating losses at the company's transport aircraft
segment in Long Beach, Calif., narrowed to $33 million from
$152 million, when the company took a stunning $93 million in
write-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10 tanker
programs. The company is still dogged by high development
expenditures on the MD-11 tri-jet as it gets ready for
federal certification by year end.
   There were some bright spots. Mr. McDonnell noted that the
company's MD-80 line posted a small profit, compared with an
operating loss of $34 million a year ago. Most importantly,
the company delivered an impressive 34 of the narrow-body
jetliners in the latest quarter. "From an-ability-to-deliver
point of view, the worst is over," Mr. McDonnell said.
   The chairman added that he has been frustrated by Wall
Street's reaction to the company's job-reduction plan,
insisting that the cutbacks "are going to contribute
substantially to our future strength."
   He implored the financial community to "look at the
potential" at McDonnell Douglas, noting that if the company
achieves merely half its goal of paring $700 million a year
from the cost structure, that would add nearly $6 a share to
earnings. "The message I'd like to get across is look at the
opportunity," Mr. McDonnell said, promising "fairly quick
results" from the cost-savings program. He noted, too, that
backlog continued to swell in the latest quarter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell Douglas closed at $43, up $1.75. Also on the Big
Board, General Dynamics finished at $31.50, off 12.5 cents.
   In addition to the A-12 charge, General Dynamics's $240
million loss, or $5.75 a share, included a separate $50
million write-down for estimated overruns on the Army
single-channel ground and airborne radio system, or Sincgars.
A year ago, net was $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share. Sales
rose 3.7% to $2.62 billion from $2.53 billion.
   The quarter included improvement in the projected recovery
schedule for F-16 deliveries by the company's Fort Worth,
Texas, division and a continued strong performance by Cessna
Aircraft, which makes business jets.
   Separately, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp. posted
second-quarter net of $29.3 million, or 63 cents a share. It
had a loss of $78.1 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier
after a $150 million loss provision on a classified research
and development contract in its missiles and unmanned vehicle
systems business segment. Sales inched up to $1.41 billion
from $1.4 billion.
