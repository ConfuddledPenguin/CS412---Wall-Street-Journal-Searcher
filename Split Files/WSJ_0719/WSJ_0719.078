   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s second-quarter profit
fell 18% as results reflected the negative impact of a
controversy surrounding sales practices in the company's
credit services business.
   Analysts said the results were in line with their
expectations and the company's indications. Dun &amp; Bradstreet
has reiterated a forecast of 1990 per-share earnings of about
$2.80, indicating an 11% decline from 1989's $3.14 a share.

   In the quarter, the company said net income fell to $123
million or 67 cents a share, from $150.4 million or 80 cents
a share a year ago. Revenue climbed 13% to $1.2 billion from
$1.06 billion. However, adjusted for the acquisition last
December of Management Science America, a software concern,
and the divestiture of Thomas Cook Travel USA in April 1989,
revenue rose 7%.
   The business-information concern said the earnings decline
was due in part to "a high single-digit decline" in revenue
at U.S. Credit Services and a sharp rise in costs relating to
the company's repositioning actions at that division.
   Last year, many customers accused Dun &amp; Bradstreet
salespeople of misleading them to buy far more credit
services than they needed. The company has conceded that, in
some cases, customers were abused. In addition, without
admitting any wrongdoing, the company reached an $18 million
agreement to settle five major lawsuits that similarly
alleged customers were deceived into overbuying services. As
part of the settlement, the company agreed to modify its
business practices in several important respects. And the
resulting changes accounted for substantial cost increases in
the credit services business.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's profit had continued to increase until
the first quarter of this year, when the effects of the
controversy began to be felt.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet shares closed at $46.125, down 75
cents.
