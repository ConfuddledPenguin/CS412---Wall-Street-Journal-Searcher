   BITING THEIR LIPS: Small business holds its fire on Bush's
tax switch.
   "Our feeling is there's nothing on the table to criticize
yet," says John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business, the largest
small-business trade group. He notes that the president could
take new taxes off the table if he doesn't reach a budget
agreement with Congress. National Small Business United calls
Mr. Bush's move "necessary and responsible" to get the
deficit and interest rates under control. Small-business
groups still want a cut in capital gains tax rates to be part
of any budget package.

   "I just hope he trades that for something," J. W. Kisling,
chairman of the small manufacturers council of the National
Association of Manufacturers, says of Mr. Bush's pull-back
from his no-new-taxes pledge. Small businesses say new
broad-based energy taxes would hurt more than an excise tax.
They argue that changing tax rates or charging businesses
environmental or energy taxes could damp a recent push among
small manufacturers to export and be more competitive.
   Interest in exporting has doubled among small
manufacturers, who see it as a new source of growth in a
sluggish U.S. economy, Mr. Kisling says.

   ENABLING THE DISABLED: Small firms get advice on the
disability law.
   Several groups focus on helping smaller companies comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act passed by Congress
last week barring discrimination in the hiring and serving of
the disabled. Phone calls seeking compliance guidance from
the Job Accommodation Network, part of the President's
Committee on the Disabled, and Mainstream Inc., a nonprofit
group, have increased about 20% in the last month. Even more
inquiries are anticipated once President Bush signs the bill
into law, as expected. The groups' advice still is general
because regulations governing the law probably won't be
completed for another year.
   Most small storefront businesses can begin by installing
ramps or widening doors for wheelchair users, the groups say.
An easy way to widen a doorway is by applying "swing clear
hinges" that let a door swing back beyond a 90-degree angle
when open, says the federal Architectural and Transportation
Barriers and Compliance Board. While some computer equipment
for disabled workers is expensive, "most state vocational
rehabilitation organizations will pay all or part of the cost
to help a company or an individual," says Larry Pencak,
Mainstream's executive director.
   The Small Business Legislative Council holds a seminar
this week on complying with the law, and the National
Restaurant Association plans a symposium in January.

   FALLING SHORT: The Federal Reserve Board's action last
week easing the rate banks charge each other for loans was
"too little, too late, and won't have any major effect on the
interest rates impacting small manufacturers," says Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers. He urges more aggressive efforts to bring down
the prime lending rate. Last month, a survey of the NAM's
small and medium-sized members showed that a third of them
are finding it more difficult to obtain credit. Mr.
Jasinowski says the tone of the responses reflected even more
concern about the economy's slow growth.

   TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY the expenses of delegates who
otherwise couldn't afford to attend the proposed White House
Conference on Small Business is the question the House Small
Business Committee will debate next week. Rep. Neal Smith,
(D., Iowa), argues that without a subsidy, the 1994 meeting
could be controlled by the organized small-business lobbying
groups. Other committee members say the offer will encourage
those who can afford the expense to claim they can't. The
Senate Small Business Committee hasn't considered a bill on
the conference.

   ENTREPRENEURS studying Eastern Europe to get a boost from
Congress.
   Lawmakers are moving to help such business owners with a
new version of the Support for Eastern European Democracies
bill (SEED II). The legislation would establish at least two
American business centers in Eastern Europe to provide
translation and telecommunications services and market
research for smaller concerns. Poland and Czechoslovakia are
likely candidates for the first two centers, which are
expected to cost from $3 million to $5 million apiece to
establish, Senate staff members say.
   SEED II would also reauthorize a fund to provide venture
capital and loans for U.S. business projects, especially
joint ventures, in Eastern Europe. The first so-called
enterprise fund was aimed only at Poland and Hungary. "This
bill is designed to stimulate a program that's been slow to
get off the ground," says Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), one
of the bill's sponsors. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is expected to vote on the measure in the next few
days, and quick congressional approval is anticipated.
   In addition, the Small Business Administration says it
will recruit American small business owners to help train
East European entrepreneurs during six-week internships in
the U.S.

   SMALL TALK: With no new nominee on the horizon to head the
SBA's Advocacy Office, Mark Hayward, the agency's liaison
with state and local governments and a former mayor of East
Providence, R.I., takes on the job until the Senate approves
a permanent boss. . . . What do you do during happy hour
after a small-business workshop on combating drug use in the
workplace? The Corporation Against Drug Abuse, a nonprofit
group, plans to serve an elegant British "high tea."
