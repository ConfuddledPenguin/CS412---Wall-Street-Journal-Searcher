   GREENSPAN SIGNALED that no further credit easing is
imminent, saying last week's move was in response to a
lending crunch rather than a deterioration in the economy.
Meantime, housing starts skidded 2.3% in June while consumer
prices jumped 0.5%, indicating that inflation continues to be
a problem.
