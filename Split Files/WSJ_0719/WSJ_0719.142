   MONTREAL -- A group led by Canam Manac Inc. said almost
all of the approximately 27% of Noverco Inc.'s shares it
didn't already own were tendered under the group's offer of
15.25 Canadian dollars (US$13.22) a share.
   The offer by Canam Manac and two Quebec government
agencies was valued at about C$220 million. The offer expired
Monday. The group said it would exercise its right to acquire
the remaining Noverco shares.
