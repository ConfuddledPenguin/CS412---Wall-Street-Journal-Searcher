   International Business Machines Corp. gave a boost to the
fledgling market for computers that recognize handwriting,
announcing it plans to build electronic pads that will allow
mobile workers uncomfortable with conventional computers to
take handwritten notes.
   Big Blue said that rather than develop the basic software
for such note-pad computers itself, it will rely on a tiny
California company to supply it. The company, Go Corp., is
attempting to establish its basic software as the standard
for electronic note pads, which are expected by some
observers to make up a major part of the computer industry by
the mid-1990s.

   IBM's decision to rely on Go marks a departure for the
world's biggest computer maker. For the past decade, Big Blue
has relied almost entirely on Microsoft Corp. to supply it
with the basic operating software for its families of
personal computers.
   "I don't think this diminishes the role of Microsoft,"
said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
"It just makes good business sense. IBM can't possibly want
all of its computing future in the hands of one company."
   Microsoft is developing its own software to take advantage
of handwriting recognition, but IBM says it won't use such
software for its electronic note pads because Microsoft aims
to keep the software compatible with DOS, the standard
operating system for many personal computers.
   M.J. Quinlan, the IBM executive who crafted the licensing
deal with Go, said he didn't think note-pad computers would
reach their intended market of computer novices "by just
extending existing software environments such as DOS." He
said that handwriting devices required new operating software
and that DOS wasn't acceptable because it was designed to be
used with a keyboard.
   Microsoft disagrees. "There's nothing about DOS that says
it can't support {handwriting} input," said Jeff Raikes, who
oversees the company's note-pad software project. Mr. Raikes
added that he felt that in licensing Go's software "IBM is
simply doing what they have always done -- investing in many
different technologies." He said that such investments don't
always result in IBM products and that he still believed Big
Blue might embrace Microsoft's approach to the note-pad
field.
   IBM's endorsement figures to help Go in its efforts to
persuade other computer makers to adopt its handwriting
software. "IBM is the best possible strategic partner from
those purposes," Mr. Shaffer said.
   Jerry Kaplan, Go's chief executive, said the company
hasn't signed any other licensing deals yet, but that it is
in negotiations to do so with several other companies.
   Not everyone is persuaded that a new operating software is
needed for note-pad computers. Tandy Corp.'s Grid Systems
Corp. subsidiary, which is the only U.S. company currently
selling note-pad computers, relies on DOS for its basic
software. "Right now, that's an easier way to go, for the
vendor and the customer, because both are familiar with DOS,"
said Alan Lefkof, president of Grid.
   However, Mr. Lefkof conceded that "maybe the Go and IBM
{approach}, once we all see it, will be fabulous. Then we
might license it."
   Mr. Quinlan wouldn't say when IBM plans to introduce its
first note-pad computers, but said that a team devoted to the
product had been created in the company's Boca Raton, Fla.,
facility and that major customers were working with IBM on
figuring out just how these new devices might best be used.
   The technology underlying note-pad computers has been
under development for years, and even today the means of
recognizing handwriting is primitive. Grid's note pad, for
instance, only recognizes neatly printed capital letters,
forcing users to write in an unnatural fashion. Still, the
company said it shipped 1,000 units last month.
   IBM's interest in the market seems likely to heighten
interest in it. Apple Computer Inc. and several start-up
companies are considering entering the market, and at least
two Japanese companies are selling such devices in Japan.
