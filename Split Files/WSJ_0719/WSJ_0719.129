   Cap Gemini Sogeti S.A. has agreed to buy the 69.5% of
Hoskyns Group PLC owned jointly by West Germany's Siemens AG
and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC for #199 million
($361.5 million), the companies said yesterday.
   CGS, a French data processing service group, also said it
would make an offer for the balance of Hoskyns shares.

   Hoskyns, a computer services group, saw its shares rise 58
pence to 353 ($6.41) following the announcement.
   CGS said it is offering 330 pence a share for Hoskyns,
valuing the whole of the company at #286 million.
   Although the board of Hoskyns said it isn't recommending
whether or not shareholders should accept the CGS offers, it
said "the terms of the offer are fair and reasonable."
   A spokesman for the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, the
U.K. body which governs regulations on bids, said the panel
hasn't yet studied the proposal.
