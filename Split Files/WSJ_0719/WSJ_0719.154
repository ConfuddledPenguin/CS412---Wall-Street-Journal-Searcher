   NEW YORK -- Confounded by the congressional testimony of
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, foreign
exchange dealers left the dollar about where they found it
yesterday.
   After hectic, seesaw trading, the greenback was up
strongly against the Swiss franc and marginally against other
European currencies but was slightly lower against the
Japanese yen.

   At no point in his testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee did Mr. Greenspan give a clear signal on the
central issue of whether markets can expect lower U.S.
interest rates.
   The Fed chief confirmed that the recent quarter-point
decline in the federal funds rate to 8% was the result of
deliberate central bank action, but he said the move
addressed a technical constriction rather than an economic
stall.
   Mr. Greenspan said the Fed wants to keep credit conditions
"about where they are" and held out the possibility of
further monetary easing to offset tightness in the market.
   The central banker said the 0.5% rise in June consumer
prices reported yesterday was "higher than we would like to
see." He allowed that, for the U.S., the risk of recession is
"a shade larger" than that of inflation but said the
likelihood of a near-term recession "seems low."
   Mr. Greenspan "is obviously dancing on the edge of a very
teetery fence," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities. "Doing one thing and saying something
else," he said, allows the Fed chief to ease monetary policy
without losing the market's confidence in him as an
inflation-fighter.
   Jesse Torres, chief foreign exchange trader in New York
for Bank Brussels Lambert, concluded that Mr. Greenspan is "a
bull on the dollar."
   Valerie Walker, New York corporate foreign exchange
manager for Chicago's Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, said the
Fed chairman "did a good job at balancing the Fed's
conflicting signals" and added that "we got pretty much what
the market expected."
   Still, Mr. Brusca said, "It was a very, very confusing
day. It always is when Greenspan speaks."
   It was also a tumultuous day, as dealers and investors who
had shorted, or oversold, the dollar ahead of the Greenspan
question-and-answer session bought that money back when the
resulting headlines proved ambiguous.
   The dollar-buying wasn't strong enough to break the dollar
out of its bounds. Several times, for example, the greenback
was slapped back down just after exceeding a technical
ceiling at 1.6490 marks. The last attempt to push the dollar
out of its range against the German currency occurred about
an hour before the close of global trading, when the U.S.
unit hit its intraday high of 1.6495 marks.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6480 marks, up from 1.6440 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 147.75 yen, just
below 147.80 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.8155, down from $1.8165.
   The dollar also ended in New York at 1.4165 Swiss francs,
well above 1.4045 francs Tuesday. The U.S. unit's gains
against the Swiss currency were abetted by the selling of
francs against other nondollar currencies.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 148.10 yen
soon after the opening; it closed at 147.25 yen in Tokyo
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6490 marks, up a bit from Tokyo's Wednesday close of 1.6436
marks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.60 an ounce, down 40 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$361.75 an ounce.
