   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose modestly against most
currencies in quiet dealings as participants found ways to
discount several developments with market-moving potential.
   Statements by top U.S. monetary officials on interest
rates and the release of figures on U.S. durable-goods orders
for April caused little change in dollar rates, traders said.

   The U.S. unit likewise remained little changed against its
Canadian and British counterparts in spite of the continuing
constitutional impasse in Canada and the release of
statistics showing a wider-than-expected U.K. merchandise
deficit for April.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6765 marks, up from 1.6736 marks late Tuesday, and at
151.45 yen, up from 151.20 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6940, up from $1.6928 late Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency was
trading at 151.18 yen, down a bit from Wednesday's Tokyo
close of 151.35 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading in
Tokyo at 1.6673 marks.
   Comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that
substantial Treasury borrowing will be necessary to pay the
debt of insolvent savings-and-loan institutions had little
effect on the dollar.
   There was little reaction to the statement, said Martin
McNulty, a vice president at Lloyd's Bank in New York. He
said participants reasoned that any positive impact on the
dollar caused by a rise in U.S. interest rates stemming from
increased Treasury borrowing would be offset by the
potentially bearish impact of a wider U.S. federal budget
deficit.
   The impact of Mr. Brady's comments, in which he said the
S&amp;L bailout could cost as much as $132 billion, was further
diluted because it has been widely assumed in the market that
the cost of rescuing insolvent S&amp;Ls would be far higher than
the $30 billion currently authorized, Mr. McNulty said.
   A statement later by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan that the resolution of the S&amp;L crisis will have
only minimal effect on interest rates served to confirm the
market's initial assessment of the situation, said Bill
Chepolis, a trader at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   The release early in the New York day of a
larger-than-expected 4.1% fall in U.S. April durable-goods
orders from March didn't affect dollar rates to a great
degree because the market is focused on budget-deficit talks
currently under way in Washington between the Bush
administration and Congress, dealers said. A fall of 2.2% had
been expected.
   While the fall in orders was seen as another sign of a
slowing U.S. economy, the market is more interested in
today's revision of first-quarter gross national product and
its attendant price deflator because of its implications for
interest rates, participants said.
   Revised first-quarter GNP is expected to show a downward
adjustment to 1.8% from an originally announced 2.1%. The
price deflator is expected to remain at 5.7%.
   Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar stabilized at slightly
higher levels against the U.S. dollar as participants settled
back following Tuesday's wild swings to assess the political
situation there, said Diego Giurleo, corporate
foreign-exchange manager at Royal Bank of Canada in New York.
   "The political situation there is not out of control," Mr.
Giurleo said, noting that the June 23 deadline for
ratification of the controversial constitutional amendment on
Quebec is still a month away.
   In the meantime, the Canadian unit will be volatile but
the currency will be prevented from falling too far by
Canada's high interest rates, he said. As was the case
yesterday, the high rates and occasional dips in the Canadian
currency will prove very attractive to bargain hunters, he
added.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery plummeted $11.50 to $364.10 an ounce. The close was
the lowest since Oct. 13. Estimated volume was a very heavy
seven million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an
ounce.
