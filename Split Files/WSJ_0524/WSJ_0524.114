   NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average kept this
week's string of all-time highs intact, as late buying pushed
the stock market higher in moderately active trading.
   Although profit-taking in response to the market's
record-breaking rally put share prices under pressure for
most of the session, the industrial average eked out a gain
of 4.03 to 2856.26.

   The average managed to set its third consecutive record
close -- and the sixth in the past eight sessions -- despite
heavy selling in Westinghouse Electric and weakness in a
number of blue-chip oil stocks, reflecting a sharp decline in
oil prices.
   "The market is still exhibiting a decided reluctance to
give in to profit-taking," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr.,
director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott,
Philadelphia.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.86 to 359.29,
about half a point from its all-time high of 359.80, set last
Oct. 9. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index went up 0.68 to
334.28 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained
0.27 to 195.85.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 761 to 745 on
the Big Board, where volume fell to 172,330,000 shares from
203,350,000 Tuesday.
   Stocks got off to a slow start as market players reacted
negatively to early weakness in bonds, which dropped in spite
of news that April orders for durable goods fell 4.1% -- a
sharper decline than expected.
   After sliding to session lows at midday, the market
briefly turned mixed at midafternoon on some
arbitrage-related buy programs, in which traders sold
stock-index futures contracts and bought baskets of stocks in
order to lock in profits from price differences between them.
   But when the bond market rebound that preceded the move in
stocks faded, share prices did the same, and they didn't turn
higher until the final minutes of trading.
   Some additional arbitrage-related buying and short
covering contributed to the upturn, said John Burnett, a
senior vice president of block trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, but he added that "real, no-kidding-around buying"
from institutions also surfaced.
   "We saw good solid buying across the board," Mr. Burnett
said, adding that portfolio managers are "afraid of missing
the boat" if the market should continue its advance instead
of giving them a chance to purchase stocks at lower prices.
   "Any kind of pullbacks here are going to be very nominal,
and I think you're going to see a lot of money flooding into
the market" on any weakness, added Alexander M. Purdie Jr.,
head of block trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta. "The
market's still looking very attractive in a lot of ways."
   Westinghouse fell 1 1/4 to 34 3/4 in Big Board composite
trading of 1.9 million shares. Shearson Lehman Hutton reduced
its investment ratings on the stock, citing expectations of a
slowdown in its earnings growth next year, and lowered its
1990 and 1991 earnings estimates.
   Oil stocks among the Dow industrials to show weakness
included Exxon, which went down 1/2 to 47 3/8; Texaco, down
1/2 to 59 3/8, and Chevron, off 5/8 to 69 3/8. But USX gained
3/4 to 33 3/4 and Du Pont, which owns Conoco, rose 1/2 to 40
3/8.
   July crude-oil futures tumbled 78 cents a barrel to $18.14
in New York trading, and the plunge left its mark on other
major oil stocks. Amoco fell 1/2 to 53 1/4, Mobil slipped 1/4
to 62 1/8 and Unocal slid 1/2 to 30 3/4.
   Several airline stocks dropped despite the oil market's
weakness, which could lead to lower fuel costs, after Trans
World Airlines announced that it would lower domestic
round-trip fares by as much as 30%. AMR, which owns American
Airlines, fell 1/2 to 64 1/2; Delta Air Lines lost 1 to 76
1/2, and USAir Group lost 1 3/8 to 27 7/8.
   Deere tumbled 2 7/8 to 73 on 1.7 million shares as a
second day of profit-taking weighed down the stock, which set
a 52-week high during Tuesday's session but posted a decline
of 1 5/8 points. Wertheim Schroder removed the stock from a
list of recommended issues and lowered its investment rating,
citing its belief that Deere's shares were fully valued.
   Compaq Computer, a star performer in the market's climb to
record highs, added 3 1/2 to 122 7/8. Moody's Investors
Service upgraded its rating on a $200 million debt issue that
Compaq has called for redemption; the agency cited the
company's cash flow and strong balance sheet as reasons for
its action.
   Other technology issues also added to their recent gains,
including Texas Instruments, which gained 2 1/8 to 43 3/8 as
1.3 million shares changed hands. International Business
Machines advanced 1 to 118 3/4, Digital Equipment gained 1
3/4 to 93 1/4 and Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/8 to 47 3/8. But
Unisys, left behind in the sector's rally, slipped 1/8 to 14
1/8.
   On the other hand, precious-metals stocks paced the
market's retreat amid a sharp decline in the price of gold.
Homestake Mining dropped 1 3/8 to 18 3/8, Placer Dome dipped
1 to 16 1/8, Battle Mountain Gold lost 5/8 to 13 1/4 and ASA
Ltd. retreated 2 3/8 to 49 1/8 in Big Board dealings. On the
American Stock Exchange, Echo Bay Mines fell 1/2 to 13,
Pegasus Gold lost 3/4 to 11 1/4 and Corona A dropped 1/2 to 7
1/8.
   Citicorp fell 7/8 to 22 7/8 in the aftermath of Moody's
downgrading of credit ratings on the bank holding company and
its Citibank unit. The move included Citicorp's commercial
paper, which hadn't been affected last month when Standard &amp;
Poor's made a similar move.
   Meanwhile, shares of two other big city banks --
BankAmerica, which gained 3/4 to 30 1/8, and Bankers Trust
New York, which added 1 5/8 to 43 1/2 -- rallied after County
NatWest Securities cited the stocks as better values than
Citicorp. Analyst Stephen Berman said the two companies have
good balance sheets and reasonably good loan quality.
   Ranking high on the Big Board's mostactive list was
Alliance Global Environmental Fund, a new issue, which closed
well above the price of its initial offering. Six million
shares of the closed-end mutual fund were sold at $15 apiece;
the stock rose 6.7% to 16 on trading of 2.1 million shares.
   Thai Capital Fund, the latest entry among single-country
mutual funds, also fared well on its initial day of trading.
The stock closed at 12 3/8, above its initial offering price
of $12 a share.
   British Gas fell 3/4 to 36 after a possible rival bidder
surfaced for Consumers' Gas, which the company has agreed to
acquire.
   ProNational Gas, a firm headed by a former chief financial
officer of Consumers' Gas, said it opposes the proposed
acquisition and plans its own offer.
   Circuit City Stores fell 1 5/8 to 24 7/8. Securities and
Exchange Commission filings show that the company's chairman
and president sold significant portions of their stakes in
Circuit City last month.
   Donaldson, which reported that net income for the fiscal
quarter ended in April rose 61% from a year earlier and
increased its quarterly dividend by about 16%, jumped 2 3/4
to 30.
   The Amex Market Value Index, hurt by the weakness in oil
and gold stocks, fell 0.20 to 359.65. Volume totaled
16,550,000 shares.
   Forest Laboratories rose 1 5/8 to 44. Wertheim Schroder
repeated a buy recommendation on the stock and set price
targets of $55 to $57 a share for the next 12 months and $70
for the next 24 months.
