   Union Carbide Corp. appointed H. William Lichtenberger,
who has been president of its chemicals and plastics unit for
the past four years, to the additional post of president and
chief operating officer of the corporation.
   Robert D. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer,
gave up the title of president, and the chief operating
officer slot is a new one at Carbide.

   In addition, Mr. Lichtenberger, 54 years old, and Joseph
E. Geoghan, 52, vice president, general counsel and
secretary, were elected directors, bringing board membership
to 14.
   The Danbury, Conn., company also named John A. Clerico
chief financial officer. Mr. Clerico, 48, has been vice
president, treasurer and principal financial officer, and has
filled the top financial officer slot since J. Clayton
Stephenson, former vice chairman and chief financial officer,
retired a year ago.
   Mr. Kennedy, in an interview, said the promotions
"recognize some very capable people," and take some pressure
off him. Mr. Kennedy, 57, said that Mr. Lichtenberger's new
responsibilities "will broaden his experience." Asked whether
the moves were intended to set up a succession, he said: "We
don't get into the business of nominating heirs apparent. But
the organization speaks for itself."
   Mr. Lichtenberger joined the big chemical company 31 years
ago as a research engineer and held a number of positions in
Carbide's industrial gases business before being named
president of the solvents and coatings materials division in
1985. In 1986, he was named president of the chemicals and
plastics operation. The unit had $5.6 billion in revenue in
1989 and contributed nearly 80% to the company's operating
profit last year.
   Reporting to Mr. Lichtenberger are vice presidents for
strategic planning, human resources and the controller and
principal accounting officer. Other top executives will
continue to report to Mr. Kennedy.
