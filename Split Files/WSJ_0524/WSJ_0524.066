   NEW YORK -- Big Wall Street securities firms want their
employees to know: For better or for worse, we're in this
together.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. will
soon join a growing roster of big securities firms in
requiring employees to plow back more of their salaries into
the firms.

   The two firms' new compensation plans, due to be announced
in the coming weeks, follow the lead of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. Amid Wall Street's recent bad times, these
firms now require staffers to take less cash and take a
significant part of their salaries in their firm's stock, or
in other incentives tied to the firm's performance.
   The new payout plans among publicly traded securities
firms mark a return to payment practices during Wall Street's
old private-partnership days. Then, spending was carefully
controlled because the partners' financial success was
directly linked with that of the firms'.
   "Eventually {Wall Street compensation} has got to become
more of a business than an art form," says Michael D. Madden,
cohead of investment banking at Shearson, a unit of American
Express Co. "The fruits of our labor should reflect
performance."
   Investment banks, many of whom are struggling these days,
save money when they keep more of employees' salaries in the
firm. Bonuses make up as much as half of the total
compensation for a typical top-level Wall Street executive;
the bonuses often are several times the size of a low
six-figure salary.
   Salomon's proposed new payment system was first outlined
by Chairman John Gutfruend at the firm's managing directors
weekend in Orlando, Fla. Under the so-called equity
partnership plan, Salomon employees would receive anywhere
from 5% to 33% of their compensation in publicly traded
Salomon Inc. stock. The higher their salary, the bigger the
percentage Salomon employees would receive in stock,
executives say.
   The plan is expected to be presented soon to Salomon's
board, and is likely to be approved within 60 days. Although
some Salomon employees aren't thrilled, a number of managing
directors say they are enthusiastic about the plan, which is
expected to significantly increase employee ownership in
Salomon above the current level, which is below 5%.
   "You can preach {return on equity} until you're blue in
the face, but you've got to have enough of your net worth
tied to the institution where you're working to have a
significant stimulus to be felt," a Salomon spokesman said.
   The Shearson compensation plan now under consideration
isn't as clearly defined. But it is aimed at more closely
tying the salaries of employees to the performance of their
specific division, rather than the past practice of linking
pay to the results of the entire firm.
   Shearson tried to restructure its payout practices last
fall, but those efforts were sidetracked by the firm's recent
financial and management problems.
   But tomorrow, Shearson expects to receive the preliminary
results of a compensation study it commissioned from McKinsey
&amp; Co., a management consulting firm, Shearson executives
said. The review will reflect Shearson's soon-to-be-announced
reshaping, which will split the firm's investment banking
business from its big brokerage network.
   "It's a top-to-bottom review at all levels and all forms
of compensation," a Shearson spokesman said.
   Unlike the Salomon proposal, however, the Shearson plan is
likely to include so-called phantom Shearson stock, instead
of publicly traded shares. American Express is scheduled to
soon buy the remaining 30% of Shearson stock now in public
hands. Phantom stock, which has no public market, is used in
the compensation plans at Prudential-Bache and Merrill.
   Other big securities firms are likely to follow suit in
requiring employees to invest in the firm, securities
executives say, in part, because Wall Street firms are
seeking ways to keep key employees from jumping ship.
   "With the tremendous number of people leaving Wall Street
because of budget cuts, there is a need to maintain the
quality of people within firms," says Stanley W. Butterfass,
president of Butterfass/Pepe Associates Inc., a New York
executive-search firm.
   At least one big securities firm recently launched a
voluntary payout plan. Bear Stearns Cos. has offered managing
directors and other high-level employees the option of
putting as much as 50% of their bonus into publicly traded
Bear Stearns stock. Employees can then defer receiving the
stock portion of their bonus until retirement.
