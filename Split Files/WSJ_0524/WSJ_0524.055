   TOKYO -- Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in
April increased 3.2% from a year earlier to 1,127,000 units,
a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association said.
   In March, production dropped 2.8% from the year earlier.

   The association said motor vehicle sales in recent months
have been supported by continuing strong domestic demand.
   The association said domestic sales of motor vehicles in
April rose 7.7% year to year, and predicted export figures,
to be released later in May, will show a roughly 18% decline
from a year earlier.
