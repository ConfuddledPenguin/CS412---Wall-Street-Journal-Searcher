   Assets of money-market mutual funds rose for the first
time in eight weeks, although yields remained in the narrow
range of the past four months.
   Investors added $2 billion to taxable money funds,
bringing total assets to $376.7 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 427 funds eased to 7.98% from 8% in the
week ended Tuesday. Compound yields assume reinvestment of
dividends.

   "As yields on alternative investments dropped last week,
money funds became more attractive," said Brenda Malizia
Negus, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.
   The average yield on a three-month certificate of deposit
at major banks, for instance, has fallen to 7.56% from 7.63%
two weeks ago, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New
York information service. Treasury-bill yields turned up a
bit at Monday's auction, to 8% for three-month bills and
8.22% for six-month bills, but they're still lower than a
month ago.
   Money-fund yields have been at or just below 8% since late
January.
   The average maturity of the funds' investments remained at
44 days for the sixth consecutive week, indicating that a
substantial change in yields isn't likely anytime soon. Money
funds invest in such things as commercial paper (short-term
corporate IOUs), Treasury bills and bank CDs.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the funds slipped to
7.68% from 7.70%. The average 30-day simple yield remained at
7.68%, and the average 30-day compound yield remained at
7.98%.
   Assets of tax-free funds also increased, by $403.5
million, Donoghue's reported. This brings the total for the
222 tax-exempt funds tracked by the newsletter to $75.7
billion.
   The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free funds
fell in the latest week, to 5.59% from 5.67%. That's
equivalent to 7.76% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 8.34% for someone paying 33% in taxes. Average maturity
shortened by a day, to 40 days.
