   Michigan's utility commission restricted the ways CMS
Energy Corp. can use $1.5 billion it planned to get after the
sale of Midland Cogeneration Venture assets.
   The order comes after a state court injunction that barred
CMS from transferring the funds. CMS was scheduled to receive
$1.2 billion in notes and $341 million in equity related to
the cogeneration venture from its Consumers Power Co. unit,
in exchange for CMS debentures.

   CMS stock fell a sharp $2.375 to close at $28.625
yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The commission said in its order that CMS, based in
Dearborn, can use proceeds from the transaction only "in ways
that will secure {Consumers Power's} financial health." The
commission said that may include repaying about $750 million
in Consumers Power bank debt and maintaining a balanced
capital structure for the unit.
   CMS called the order "unlawful," particularly the
"attempted assertion over the non-utility, non-jurisdictional
assets of the company." CMS said it will appeal.
