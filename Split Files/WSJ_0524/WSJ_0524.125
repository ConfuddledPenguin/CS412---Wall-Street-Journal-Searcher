   CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government said it
won't approve a proposed merger of Australia &amp; New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) with National Mutual Life
Association of Australasia Ltd.
   The proposed merger, announced in April, would have
created the biggest financial concern in Australia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Paul Keating, Australia's treasurer, said the merger would
be "contrary to the national interest and shouldn't proceed."
   ANZ is one of Australia's four biggest banks, while
National Mutual is the second-largest life-insurance company.
Therefore, Mr. Keating said, a merger "carries substantial
implications for the future structure and direction of the
financial system in this country."
   He said Australia needs effective competition in banking,
life insurance and financial services in general.
