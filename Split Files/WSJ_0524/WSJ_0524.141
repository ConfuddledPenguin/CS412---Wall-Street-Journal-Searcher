   GOLD PRICES PLUNGED for the second time in two months,
sparking a volatile bond rally that also boosted stocks. The
decline by gold, which closed down $11.80 an ounce on the
Comex, at $364.60, was attributed again to heavy selling by
Saudi Arabia. The Dow Jones industrials closed up 4.03, at a
record 2856.26. The dollar edged higher.
