   A dissident shareholder filed suit, demanding that
Builders Transport Inc. set a date for the company's annual
meeting.
   The holder, David C. Walentas, filed the suit in Delaware
Chancery Court. Mr. Walentas and Stanford M. Dinstein,
another holder, hold a total of roughly 6.8% of the Camden,
S.C., trucking company's 4.9 million shares outstanding.

   In February, Builders Transport signed a non-binding
letter of intent to be acquired for $15 a share, or $73.6
million, by closely held Comcar Industries Inc., an
Auburndale, Fla., trucking company. In December, Builders
Transport rebuffed a $13-a-share offer from the two
shareholders.
   Mr. Walentas intends to solicit proxies at the annual
meeting in an effort to replace the board, said Jonathan
Wagner, attorney for Mr. Walentas.
   The company hasn't scheduled the annual meeting because it
is reviewing another takeover proposal it received from Trism
Inc., the Joplin, Mo., parent of trucking firm Tri-State
Motor Transit Inc. of Delaware, said Robert E. Lee Garner,
Builders Transport's general counsel and corporate secretary.
Trism has proposed to pay $14 cash plus $3 of preferred stock
for each Builders Transport share.
   The company has sued Mr. Walentas in federal court in
Columbia, S.C., charging him with violating securities laws;
Mr. Walentas has countersued to invalidate an employee stock
ownership plan.
