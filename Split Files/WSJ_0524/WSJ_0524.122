   Carnival Cruise Lines Inc., Miami, said it is seeking more
than $700 million in damages from two Finnish companies that
contracted to build three cruise ships for Carnival.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, Carnival
alleges that Oy Wartsila AB and Valmet Oy AB, both based in
Helsinki, procured contracts to build the ships by
misrepresenting the financial condition of their shipbuilding
subsidiary, Wartsila Marine Industries Inc.

   Wartsila Marine filed for bankruptcy in October 1989
without fulfilling the contracts, Carnival said. Masa Yards,
a shipbuilding operation formed by Wartsila Marine's
customers, eventually completed construction of two Carnival
ships -- the Fantasy, which began service in March, and the
Ecstasy. A third ship, the Sensation, is yet to be built.
   Officials at Oy Wartsila and Valmet Oy couldn't be reached
for comment.
