   New Jersey doesn't take kindly to lip service.
   Two state assemblymen recently introduced a bill requiring
performers to announce before concerts whether they'll sing
live or lip-sync to recorded music.

   Use of recordings struck a responsive chord in the two
legislators after constituents complained of paying $20 to
$30 for tickets to concerts at which big-name singers weren't
singing.
   "Is it live or is it Memorex? People have a right to
know," says Assemblyman Neil Cohen, bill co-sponsor and vice
chairman of the Consumer Affairs Committee.
   Concert promoters may hit a sour note if the bill becomes
law; penalties could be as high as $50,000 if promoters fail
to inform ticket buyers whether a performer plans to use
recordings.
   Carl Freed, executive director of the North American
Concert Promoters Association, agrees with the spirit of the
bill, but says: "I think the bill is a little farfetched.
There's got to be a compromise." Printed warnings might hurt
ticket sales, and the audience would "lose the ability to
suspend disbelief."
   Some performers have used taped music as a background prop
for years. Increasingly, though, such performers as Paula
Abdul and Janet Jackson have come to rely on taped music as
they pursue perfection in their elaborate stage shows and
complex dance routines. Milli Vanilli and New Kids on the
Block use taped vocals for as many as half their concerts,
reports Billboard, a trade publication. Agents for the groups
didn't return phone calls.
   Moreover, "kids today are reared on MTV, and they've come
to expect studio-quality performances," says New Jersey
Assemblyman Joe Mecca, a co-sponsor of the bill.
   But such precision acts can backfire. On tour last summer,
Billboard reports, the group Milli Vanilli (which received a
1990 Grammy for best new artist) walked off the stage after a
malfunction stopped its vocals. Minutes later, the band
played on, but no one was on stage.
   Taped vocals can save a lot of breath when singers stage
spunky dance routines, and can be insurance against illness.
   But fans, and even some ticket brokers, decry the
practice. "It's sort of like going to an opera and having
them play the album," says Chris White, office manager of
American Ticket Service. "Hey, if I wanted to hear
prerecorded music, I'd go to listen to a deejay."
