   NEW YORK -- The television industry's May "sweeps" ratings
period concluded last night with a surprise ending that would
rival a Hollywood script. CBS, the beleaguered last-place
network, came close to finishing No. 1 for the month, while
powerhouse NBC won -- but lost 18% of its audience from the
same period a year earlier.
   National Broadcasting Co. won the May sweeps by the
narrowest margin in years, attracting 12% of U.S. homes with
TV sets each night, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. CBS, mired
in the ratings basement for three years, ran a surprisingly
close second, thanks to scheduling gimmicks and one-time
specials, drawing 11.8% of homes. ABC came in third with
11.4% of households tuning in each night.

   The May sweeps is one of the four months in each year when
local stations' future advertising rates are determined by
ratings performance. Network executives don't expect the
final tally to change much from the figures available
yesterday, despite last night's finale of "Twin Peaks," the
loopy and stylish series on ABC.
   The CBS Inc. TV network's strong finish was bolstered by a
most unusual program: the lost pilot of the 1950s series "I
Love Lucy." CBS also was helped by a strong slate of movies
and specials, including celebrity interviews by Connie Chung.
But David F. Poltrack, a CBS senior vice president, said the
network's regular series also helped jump-start ratings.
"Murphy Brown" was up 20% in ratings from last year and
"Designing Women" rose 16%.
   The razor-thin victory for NBC, a unit of General Electric
Co., underscored the recent unexpected vulnerability of the
network, which has been No. 1 in prime time for five years.
"This was the most competitive sweeps in seven years,"
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, said.
   CBS "stunted effectively" against NBC and ABC, Mr.
Tartikoff said, admitting that "we have a vulnerable network.
We're still No. 1, but vulnerable."
   Some of NBC's core series were significantly down from
last May, including "L.A. Law," down 9%, "The Cosby Show,"
off by 11%, and "The Golden Girls," down 17%. NBC will make
changes in six nights of its weekly schedule and will replace
six hours of programming with nine new shows next fall. To
hold on to its No. 1 title, NBC will have to come out "with
both guns blazing" when the new TV season begins next fall,
Mr. Tartikoff said.
   Preston Beckman, an NBC vice president, said last May's
victory was particularly strong because of final,
series-ending episodes of "Family Ties" and "Miami Vice."
There were no such special broadcasts this month, he said.
   But CBS's Mr. Poltrack countered that even when the
ratings of regular, ongoing series are counted, they still
showed a sharp drop of 14% from a year ago on NBC. ABC, a
unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., was down 12%, by comparison
and CBS's series ratings were off 5% compared with May 1989.
   ABC ran third, albeit by a slim margin, despite boasting
the only bona fide hit of the season, "America's Funniest
Home Videos" and the most talked about show of the year,
"Twin Peaks." Instead of loading up on one-time specials, ABC
used the May sweeps to try out new series, including "The
Marshall Chronicles" and Oprah Winfrey's "Brewster Place,"
neither of which were picked up for the new TV season next
fall.
   CBS's strong showing is likely to help placate the
network's 200-plus affiliate stations, whose managers gather
in Los Angeles beginning June 26 for the annual affiliate
convention. The stations benefit from CBS's May performance
because local ads are sold based on the number of households
watching a program, as opposed to how many viewers in various
age groups are tuning in.
   National network ads, however, are sold based on
demographic groups and CBS, despite its finish, continues to
attract an older audience that is less desirable to
advertisers. ABC pulls in the younger adult audience, a
segment that used to be dominated by NBC. NBC recently has
been forced to give advertisers free time, or "make-goods,"
to compensate for delivering fewer 18-to-49-year-old viewers
than promised.
   "We think it's going to be an open battle in the fall,"
said an ebullient Mr. Poltrack of CBS between screenings of
CBS pilots. CBS is expected to announce its new fall line-up
late this week or early next week.
