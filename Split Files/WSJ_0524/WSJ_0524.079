   COMPAQ COMPUTER Corp. (Houston) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it upgraded the convertible subordinated
debt rating to Baa-3 from Ba-2 on the computer company's $200
million of debt, which has been called for redemption and is
expected to convert to equity in its entirety. The rating
service cited Compaq's "cash flow generation and its strong
balance sheet," as well as its asset-management capability
and the broadening of its global presence.
