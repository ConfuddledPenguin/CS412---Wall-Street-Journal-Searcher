   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. agreed with
the Soviet Ministry of Communications to explore joint
ventures in telecommunications services, equipment
manufacturing, and research and development.
   AT&amp;T said it will send scientists from AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories to Moscow later this year to discuss projects
ranging from digital switching technology to satellite
networks aimed at upgrading the Soviet Union's rickety phone
system.

   News of the agreement, signed quietly earlier this month,
surfaced in CommunicationsWeek International, an industry
newspaper. Last December, AT&amp;T agreed to use the U.S.S.R.'s
Intersputnik satellite network for the first time to handle
communications traffic between the U.S. and the Soviet Union,
a proposal the State Department has asked the Federal
Communications Commission to reject.
   AT&amp;T also is seeking to supply fiberoptic cable and
transmission equipment to one of Moscow's biggest
telecommunications projects, planned construction of an
8,680-mile, $500 million cable linking Europe and Asia.
   In serving technology-starved Eastern Europe, AT&amp;T Network
Systems International recently received a contract to supply
digital switching equipment to Poland to handle international
phone traffic. Yesterday, AT&amp;T Bell Labs said 10 of Poland's
top telecommunications engineers will visit Bell Labs as part
of a free training program sponsored by the U.S.
Telecommunications Training Institute, also hosted by
BellSouth Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp., AT&amp;T said.
