   NEWARK, N.J. -- B. Manischewitz Co. said it will fight a
federal indictment that it conspired to fix the price of
matzo served during Passover.
   The Jersey City maker of kosher foods decided to plead
innocent after U.S. District Judge Harold Ackerman refused to
accept the company's request to plead no contest to the
charges. The U.S. attorney had objected to the company's plea
request.

   In court papers, the government said accepting
Manischewitz's request would "blur the question of guilt" and
permit the company "to deny any wrongdoing and to argue that
its plea was entered solely to avoid litigation and business
expense." It also said a no-contest plea would assist
Manischewitz in defending itself in other related civil
suits. Five civil lawsuits connected to the indictment have
been filed against the company in state or federal courts in
New Jersey, California and Illinois, according to Justin P.
Walder, Manischewitz's lawyer.
   Mr. Walder said the company hoped its no-contest plea
would save it from a costly legal defense. But following
Judge Ackerman's decision, he says, "We are prepared to
proceed and test the stale allegations of these charges in a
traditional proceeding."
   An arraignment date hasn't been set.
   Manischewitz, according to the complaint, took in about
$25 million of revenue from sales of Passover matzo products
in the U.S from 1981 to 1986.
   The government hasn't named Manischewitz's alleged
co-conspirators. But in court papers, it said the company
"acquired most of the assets of its major co-conspirator
after Passover 1986." According to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, Manischewitz, in August 1986, purchased
certain assets from Horowitz Bros. &amp; Margareten, a New York
matzo maker, for $1.7 million in cash and notes.
   Regardless of its plea, Manischewitz faces a penalty of $1
million or more, if convicted.
