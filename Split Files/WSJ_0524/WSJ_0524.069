   WASHINGTON -- The House Democratic leadership, stepping
away from confrontation with the Bush administration, agreed
to expedite aid to Central America without resolving first
the issue of military assistance to El Salvador.
   Their agreement clears the way for adoption this week of
legislation that would provide more than $4 billion in new
spending for the current fiscal year. The measure includes
$720 million to help the new governments in Panama and
Nicaragua reduce their debt and finance private investment.

   President Bush has insisted Congress complete the aid
package before its Memorial Day recess. But that appeared in
doubt after a stormy debate Tuesday night, in which the
administration and its Republican allies scuttled related
authorizing legislation after the House approved a Democratic
amendment that would have cut aid to El Salvador because of
alleged human-rights abuses there.
   Yesterday, after a telephone conversation with Secretary
of State James Baker, House Rules Committee Chairman Joseph
Moakley said he had been promised "good faith" negotiations
on the Salvador question in the coming weeks. Still, the
leadership's decision to let the spending bill advance even
though the issue of aid to El Salvador wasn't settled left
liberals bitter.
   The El Salvador debate reflects increasing concern in
Congress over continued human-rights abuses by the military
there. Moreover, maneuvering by both sides showed the
increased vulnerability of foreign aid in general. The swing
voters included a bloc of more than 40 Southern and border
state Democrats who supported putting conditions on aid, but
then abandoned the entire package when the GOP backed away
from it.
   "Foreign aid is in serious trouble," said Rep. Thomas
Downey (D., N.Y.).
   As much as the administration has ridiculed domestic
spending that Congress has added to the pending
appropriations bill, it may now be the best way of saving the
Central America package. Expenditures for education,
veterans, and nutrition are sure to be highlighted as the
bill moves toward a final vote, and lawmakers have salted the
legislation with assorted provisions for parochial interests.
