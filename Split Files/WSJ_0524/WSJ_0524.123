   THE SOVIET UNION WILL HOLD a national referendum on
economic changes.
   Indicating that Moscow believes the government must have
clear public support before starting a potentially
destabilizing five-year transition to a market economy, the
Kremlin said it would hold a nationwide vote on the plan. It
was unclear whether the public would endorse the economic
program, which would double food prices, lead to closures of
inefficient factories, and eventually allow private ownership
of most businesses. Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost.
Premier Ryzhkov is to present the plan today to the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament.

   Lithuania offered to suspend some laws passed since
declaring independence March 11, but the republic stopped
short of meeting Gorbachev's demand to rescind the
declaration itself.

   THE HOUSE VOTED to approve wideranging anti-pollution
legislation.
   The clean-air bill, cleared by a 401-21 vote, would impose
$21.5 billion a year in costs on industry when it is fully in
effect. Prior to passage, the chamber defied a presidential
veto threat and added a $250 million unemployment-assistance
program. The lawmakers also approved plans to launch a pilot
program in California requiring production of cars capable of
using non-gasoline fuels. The Senate approved a clean-air
bill last month.
   House Democratic leaders agreed to expedite $720 million
in aid to Panama and Nicaragua without resolving the issue of
Salvadoran military assistance.

   NATO defense ministers called for a quick East-West
agreement to reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms
in Europe. At the two-day meeting in Brussels, Cheney
acknowledged a safety problem with U.S. artillery shells on
the Continent, but said it was fixed and there never was a
risk of accidental nuclear explosions.
                                                                                                       

   Baker said Bush will press Gorbachev to cut conventional
forces in Europe. The secretary of state, discussing the
agenda for next week's superpower summit, also said it was
unlikely that the Soviet Union would be granted
most-favored-nation trade status at the meeting in Washington
because Moscow hasn't moved to ease emigration laws.

   The Senate cleared a provision banning nine types of
semi-automatic weapons, a defeat for gun lobbyists that cast
doubt on the future of an omnibus anti-crime package. The
senators also narrowly rejected an attempt by Republicans to
toughen Democratic proposals to limit appeals by deathrow
inmates.

   HHS Secretary Sullivan plans to recommend to states
restrictions on cigarette vending machines, a legal smoking
age of 19, and tougher licensing provisions as part of a
stepped-up campaign against smoking by minors. Separately,
Harvard University said it has sold most of its investments
in tobacco companies.

   Israeli troops enforced curfews in the occupied lands, and
Palestinians observed a strike to protest Sunday's killing of
Arabs. Israel's government, meanwhile, indirectly accused the
U.S. of perpetuating violence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, while Washington said it was prepared to consider the
use of U.N. observers in the region.

   Poland offered to meet with strikers who have disrupted
rail traffic across the northwest part of the country. But
Warsaw ruled out pay increases, saying such raises would
sabotage efforts at economic restructuring. Solidarity
founder Walesa said the four-day-old walkout threatened
democracy, and he urged the railwaymen to return to work.

   British researchers found that a long-ignored form of
cholesterol in the blood, lipoprotein (a), may be capable of
causing coronary heart disease and heart attacks. The new
finding is likely to be important in doctors' decisions on
which drugs to use to lower high cholesterol levels in
certain patients.

   Federal health officials reported that overall conditions
in the nation's nursing homes have improved. But a 93-volume
survey of 15,600 homes that receive Medicare and Medicaid
payments found that many fall short of standards for handling
food and administering drugs.

   North appeared before a federal judge in Washington, but
left the courthouse without testifying before a grand jury
empaneled last week to investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
The former Reagan aide's short appearance suggests he may
have been subpoenaed and is challenging the order.

   South African police conducted house-to-house searches in
the black township of Thabong in the Orange Free State
province, where 12 people have died this week in clashes with
security forces and in mob attacks. The police confiscated
weapons and then drove a convoy to a neighboring white town
to allay fears of possible violence.

   Hungary's new coalition assumed power, pledging to seek
withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and membership in the
European Community. The non-Communist legislature in Budapest
approved a program of national renewal that calls for
economic changes to slow the current 20% rate of inflation.
