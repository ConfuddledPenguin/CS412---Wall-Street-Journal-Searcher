   WASHINGTON -- In a surprising defeat of the powerful gun
lobby, a provision banning nine types of semi-automatic
weapons survived two close votes in the Senate and remained
part of an omnibus anti-crime bill.
   The gun-control victory startled even its proponents and
cast doubt on the future of the overall anti-crime package.
Republicans immediately threatened to filibuster the
Democratic-sponsored omnibus legislation. Bush administration
lobbyists predicted a veto if the package made it to the
White House with the prohibition on military-style "assault"
weapons.

   "There's definitely a possibility of a filibuster," said
an aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who led the
unsuccessful attack on the gun-control measure. The timing of
a potential filibuster was unclear.
   In action on another part of the bill, the Senate narrowly
rejected a Republican attempt to toughen Democratic proposals
to curb appeals by death-row inmates. The Republican
amendment was defeated by a vote of 50-47, but will be put to
another vote today. Both versions of the limits on death-row
appeals would appear to overturn Supreme Court precedent
restricting such appeals, according to a Bush administration
lobbyist. The president has threatened to veto a bill that
would have such an effect.
   The omnibus anti-crime package has a long way to go before
reaching the White House. Even without a filibuster, a final
vote on the bill probably won't come until next week. The
House, meanwhile, is far behind in considering comparable
legislation.
   Smarting from yesterday's defeat, the National Rifle
Association vowed to continue fighting the ban on
semi-automatic weapons. "We lost a skirmish today," said
James Baker, the NRA's director of federal affairs. He
predicted another tough battle when the House debates an
assault-weapon ban later this year.
   The Senate version would bar for three years the import of
five foreign-made assault weapons and the manufacture or sale
of four domestic types. Even with the proposed ban, about a
dozen models of assault weapons would remain available in the
U.S. In a seeming contradiction to its opposition to this
measure, the Bush administration last year banned the import
of certain assault rifles because they aren't suitable for or
adaptable to "sporting purposes."
   Gun-control advocates contend that assault weapons don't
have any legitimate use and have become favorites among
criminals.
   The Senate defeated an amendment to kill the weapons ban
on a vote of 52-48. The narrow margin prompted opponents to
move for a second vote, but the Senate voted 50-49 not to
reconsider. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) didn't participate in
the second vote, and Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas,
who initially voted for the gun-control measure for purely
parliamentary reasons, switched sides on the second vote.
   In a desperation maneuver, NRA lobbyists contacted the
office of Vice President Dan Quayle to secure his vote in
case of a tie. But the vice president never appeared in the
Senate yesterday, and the effort became moot when the pro-gun
forces came up one vote short.
   Several longtime NRA supporters ultimately supported the
assault-weapon ban sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D.,
Ariz.) after voting against broader restrictions proposed by
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio).
   Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, for example,
risked angering hunters in his home state by voting for the
DeConcini version. "Our nation can accept some limits on
firearms ownership when the firearms in question have no
valid hunting or sporting purpose," he said in a prepared
statement.
