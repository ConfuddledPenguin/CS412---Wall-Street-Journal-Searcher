   FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Prime Motor Inns Inc. said it agreed to
sell a 65% stake in its Ramada and Howard Johnson franchise
systems to an investment partnership.
   The agreement calls for Prime to retain roughly a 35%
equity stake in a joint venture consisting of 490 Ramada
locations and 430 Howard Johnson locations. The joint venture
will be managed by the investment partnership, Blackstone
Capital Partners L.P., an affiliate of the Blackstone Group.

   Prime, one of the largest U.S. hotel companies, is
retaining its AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inns chains and its
Rodeway Inns international franchise system.
   Prime also said it had signed a confidentiality agreement
related to the Ramada and Howard Johnson franchises with
Manor Care Inc., the Silver Spring, Md.-based franchiser of
rival Quality Inns hotels. When Prime first announced its
accord with Blackstone earlier this month, Manor Care made
public a letter to Prime indicating interest in buying the
two franchises without making a formal offer.
   Prime said its agreement with Blackstone allows Prime's
board to entertain other offers made before the transaction
with Blackstone closes, if Blackstone is paid certain
unspecified fees. It isn't clear when the transaction,
subject to certain conditions, is expected to close.
   Under the agreement with Blackstone, Prime will receive
about $140 million, including $133 million in cash and $7
million in receivables, plus other consideration which Prime
didn't outline. The company previously valued the total
transaction at about $200 million, including about $60
million in notes.
   An official recently said Prime had paid down about $40
million of its $320 million bank debt, and that proceeds from
the Blackstone accord would be used to pay half the remaining
$280 million.
   Manor Care Inc. couldn't be reached for comment on the
confidentiality agreement it signed with Prime Motor Inns.
