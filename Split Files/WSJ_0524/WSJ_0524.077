   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration acknowledged that
the cost of the savings and loan cleanup could nearly double,
and said the government borrowing needed to finance it could
produce upward pressure on interest rates.
   Ultimately, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told
Congress yesterday, the taxpayer is on the hook for the new
costs.

   Previously, the Bush administration estimated that $50
billion would cover the costs of closing down all the S&amp;Ls
that became insolvent through 1992, with another $23 billion
required for thrifts that went under after 1992. The
administration now estimates those costs at between $90
billion and $130 billion.
   Those numbers don't include billions of dollars in
interest on borrowings to finance the cleanup, plus
additional costs of S&amp;L sales in 1988. When those expenses
are added, the cost over 10 years could approach $300
billion, compared with $166 billion that the administration
previously forecast.
   The S&amp;L industry, paying higher deposit-insurance premiums
and other assessments associated with the bailout, can't
provide any of the added cash. "Additional resources will
have to come from Treasury funds," Mr. Brady told the Senate
Banking Committee.
   Mr. Brady played down the importance of the current S&amp;L
costs in President Bush's call for a budget summit with
congressional leaders. When asked why the summit was called
at this time, the secretary replied: "It's budget time."
   But at a separate Senate hearing yesterday, White House
Budget Director Richard Darman said the S&amp;L costs figured
prominently. "The prospect of all this additional borrowing
in a compressed period . . . could lead to upward pressure on
interest rates," threatening economic growth, Mr. Darman
said.
   "Higher interest rates could mean the economy goes from
growth -- although it's too slow growth -- into recession,"
Mr. Darman told a Senate appropriations subcommittee. "It's
important we have a deficit-reduction package to avoid upward
pressure on interest rates." Because the government can't
avoid borrowing to finance the S&amp;L cleanup, he argued, it
should reduce borrowing for other purposes.
   Congress has been skeptical of the cost estimates of the
bailout since the plan was announced in February 1989. The
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
estimated last month that the total cleanup costs would reach
$140 billion, not including interest.
   The original Bush plan assumed there would be no
inflation, that thrift deposits would grow steadily, and that
fewer new S&amp;Ls would fail. Instead, interest rates have risen
about one percentage point, the real estate market -- the
investment vehicle for most S&amp;Ls -- is weak, more thrifts
have become insolvent than expected, and buyers for insolvent
thrifts have been scarce.
   "This is an unmitigated disaster," said Rep. Thomas
McMillen (D., Md.). "I think we are going to continue to see
these numbers racheted upward."
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency that sells
insolvent thrifts, already has 423 thrifts under its control,
and in new estimates announced yesterday, the Office of
Thrift Supervision said that it projects another 299
failures. Beyond that, 315 other S&amp;Ls are considered possible
failures, depending on economic conditions. If many more in
the borderline group fail, it would push the costs toward the
high end of the administration estimates.
   The final costs won't be known until the investments of
the government-seized thrifts are sold to the private sector.
In the thrift assets sold so far, losses have ranged from 14%
to 23% of book value, a senior administration official said.
That doesn't include losses that the government acquired when
it took over the thrifts.
   Despite slow sales of the thrift assets and added costs,
Congress should resist the temptation to tinker with the new
S&amp;L law -- with the exception of appropriating new funds, Mr.
Brady said. He advised Congress to provide indefinite
authority to fund the rest of the cleanup, rather than in
increments.
