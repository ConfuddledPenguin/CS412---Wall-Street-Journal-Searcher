   WASHINGTON -- Neil Bush, the son of the president,
staunchly defended his actions as a director of a big Denver
savings and loan association that collapsed, arguing that he
"absolutely" didn't have a conflict of interest despite
business ties to big borrowers who defaulted on millions of
dollars in loans.
   Mr. Bush, testifying before the House Banking Committee,
said that while his business partners invested in his oil and
gas operations, he had no investment in their businesses.
Thus, Mr. Bush argued, he didn't stand to benefit from
approving or helping the business partners obtain loans. The
committee is looking into the collapse of the S&amp;L, Silverado
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association, which is expected to
cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion.

   Mr. Bush's view of conflict of interest drew a skeptical
reaction from many Democrats on the panel, though Republicans
defended the president's son. "I think you are seriously
flawed about what a conflict of interest is," said Rep. Paul
Kanjorski (D., Pa.).
   In one unusual transaction that hadn't been previously
disclosed, Kenneth Good, a business partner of Mr. Bush's,
lent him $100,000 to be invested in a "high-risk" commodities
pool, Mr. Bush said. But the loan didn't have to be repaid if
the investment wasn't successful. The investment was lost and
Mr. Good forgave the loan. Mr. Good was a preferred
shareholder in and a major borrower from Silverado.
   "I know it sounds a little fishy, but I've heard this
happen before," Mr. Bush said.
   Mr. Bush said he didn't believe the risk-free loan created
any conflict of interest for him because the transaction and
the loss occurred in 1984, a year before Mr. Bush joined the
Silverado board. But Mr. Bush said the loan was never
disclosed to other board members, even though it wasn't
actually canceled until this year.
   Mr. Bush said he abstained from voting on any loans that
Mr. Good sought from Silverado, because in September 1986 Mr.
Good obtained an option to invest $3 million and gain an 80%
interest in Mr. Bush's oil and gas firm, JNB Exploration Co.
"I never talked with Ken Good about any of his transactions
that came before the Silverado board," Mr. Bush said
yesterday. "That wasn't our relationship."
   But the committee released a letter from Mr. Bush to
Silverado's chairman, Michael Wise, dated Nov. 5, 1986,
asking for a $900,000 line of credit to back up a partnership
of Mr. Good's. The partnership, in conjunction with Mr. Bush,
was trying to obtain oil and gas business in Argentina. The
line of credit was never funded, Mr. Bush said.
   As disclosed previously, Mr. Bush as a director did vote
to approve $106 million in Silverado loans to William
Walters, a Denver real estate developer. The loans later went
into default. Like Mr. Good, Mr. Walters was also an investor
in JNB Exploration. But because Mr. Walters was a "passive
partner," Mr. Bush said, he didn't feel he had to abstain
from Silverado dealings with Mr. Walters.
   But Mr. Walters also lent Mr. Bush $1.75 million through a
bank he controlled, Cherry Creek National Bank, noted Rep.
Stephen Neal (D., N.C.). "In this set of facts lies the
potential for conflict of interest," said Mr. Neal. Mr.
Walters "is a major stockholder in your company. He is a
major lender to you. For that reason you would be inclined to
be friendly to him. Now we have $106 million in loans for
which the taxpayer has to pick up the tab."
   Mr. Bush argued that the loans to Mr. Walters were
carefully studied and approved unanimously by the full
Silverado board. He also said he "never viewed Mr. Walters as
being the owner of the {Cherry Creek} bank because I never
dealt with Mr. Walters." Mr. Bush dealt with another loan
officer, he said.
   Mr. Bush blamed the collapse of Silverado on the free-fall
in commercial real estate values in the Denver region. "I
don't think it was mismanagement or fraud or any other evil
that's out there," Mr. Bush said. "The Colorado economy is
flat on its back."
   He also lashed out at Democrats on the committee critical
of his actions. "To finger-point and to look for crooks where
there are none is not a service to this country," he said.
   In response to a question from the committee's ranking
Republican, Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio), Mr. Bush said he
never intervened with regulators or tried to use any
political influence to slow down the closing of Silverado in
December 1988.
   Five former directors and officers of Silverado have
signed consent agreements with federal regulators barring
them from working in the financial industry. Mr. Bush refused
to sign a consent agreement in January, and the matter is
being pursued in an administrative proceeding. Regulators are
seeking an order that would ban Mr. Bush, if he ever is a
director of a financial institution again, from engaging in
agreements similar to those in which he was involved at
Silverado.
