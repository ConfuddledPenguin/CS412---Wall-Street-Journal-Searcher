   NEW YORK -- Telecommunications companies attracted the
most computer-technology venture capital investment in 1989
while funding of computer software and services companies
fell sharply, according to a survey by Technologic Partners.
   Of the $1.24 billion invested, more than 25%, or $320
million, went to telecommunications products and services
companies. That's an increase of 55%, said Technologic
Partners, a Manhattan-based research firm. It found that
1988's No. 1 target for investment, computer software and
services, fell 23% to $208 million.

   "In the last five years some of the most successful new
companies have been telecommunications companies," said
Richard A. Shaffer, principal at Technologic. Meanwhile, he
said, the computer business has become a hodgepodge of
technologies and players that confounds investors.
   "Seed," or early stage financing, a growing segment in the
past five years, was another loser in 1989, falling 10% to
$62 million, or 33 seed financings, compared with $69
million, or 41 seeds, in 1988.
   While later-stage, or "mezzanine," financings also
declined, middle-stage investments garnered greater support
from investors who held back until companies were well under
way. Mr. Shaffer said this should continue as long as the
market for initial public offerings remains slow.
   Other top targets for investment, according to
Technologic, included computer peripheral companies,
third-ranked at $140 million; integrated circuit
manufacturers ($133 million); and computer systems suppliers
($130 million).
