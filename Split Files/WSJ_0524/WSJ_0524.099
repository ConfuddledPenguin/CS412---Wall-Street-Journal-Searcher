   NEW YORK -- Put four money managers in a room and you'll
get five opinions on where the market is headed. It happened
again yesterday as the pros gathered to speculate on where
stocks go from here.
   Gamco Investors' Mario Gabelli is starting to buy
cable-television stocks for the first time in a year. Morgan
Stanley's Byron R. Wien thinks stocks will finish the year
higher, but still expects a second-quarter correction.

   Windsor Fund's John B. Neff remains highly skittish about
the market, but he likes some banks and thrifts. Comstock
Partners' Stanley D. Salvigsen favors gold.
   The four money-management superstars held forth at the
first annual conference of the Association for Investment
Management and Research (newly formed from a merger of
Financial Analysts Federation and the Institute of Chartered
Financial Analysts).
   The market's run of record-breaking days hasn't dried up
the supply of undervalued stocks, says Mr. Gabelli: "We see
more values today than we have in a long time." His list of
favorites includes Paramount Communications, despite its
price drop this year. "All roads lead to Hollywood," he says,
and "Paramount is dominant."
   He also likes BHC Communications, spun off to former
Warner Communications shareholders as part of Time's
acquisition of Warner. He says the company, headed by Herbert
Siegel, holds cash equal to $51 a share -- less than
yesterday's closing price of 48 3/4.
   Then there's an old Gabelli mainstay: cable TV. "The
stocks have overreacted to all the negatives and are selling
at such a bargain price," he says, that "I for the first time
in a year am out there with a basket buying things" such as
United Artists Entertainment.
   Mr. Gabelli also is "starting to look at" venture capital.
There are "a lot of little companies out there that just
don't have access to the capital markets {and} are going to
be very, very attractive," he says.
   Mr. Wien, Morgan Stanley's investment strategist along
with Barton Biggs, said in January that he expected an up
year for stocks, a forecast that looks much better in view of
the market's reversal. Now he offers a cautionary word,
despite the new records on the Dow industrials. "Fewer than
50% of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are above
their 200-day moving average," he says. "This is the
narrowest market that I can find in history. . . . My own
feeling is that it will broaden out, but an alternative view
is that the narrowness is a warning signal."
   Mr. Wien describes himself as "probably the last living
American who thinks that corporate profits are going to be
higher in 1990 than those in 1989." He sees earnings of the
Dow industrials totaling $26 a share, about $2 above the Wall
Street consensus.
   Technology stocks account for 22% of Mr. Wien's model
portfolio, with Tandem Computers and Centex Telemanagement
among his favorites. An airline shakeout will benefit the
survivors, he says. His overall view hasn't changed from the
start of the year: "The market has a serious correction in
the second quarter from a level above 3000, but ends the year
at 3100."
   Mr. Neff is keeping faith in his beloved low P/E stocks,
the ones priced at low multiples of corporate earnings,
although his picks trailed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by 17
percentage points in 1989 and almost three points so far this
year. He's trying to regain ground by prospecting in one of
the market's minefields: financial institutions.
   "This is a difficult area and there is going to be some
{more} carnage, but not every bank and every savings and loan
is overconcentrated" in problem loans, says Mr. Neff.
Meanwhile investors' fear of financial-services stocks is
making the good ones better buys.
   Mr. Neff is high on BankAmerica, which he calls the
"classic no-brainer in an apprehensive bank market
environment." Another is Golden West Financial, "the ultimate
layup in an overconcerned marketplace." Also on his list are
H.F. Ahmanson and Citicorp.
   Mr. Neff frets about the overall market, however, noting
"disquieting similarities to past periods" of turmoil, such
as in 1973-74. Of particular concern: The "heady evaluations
of the allegedly super-safe stocks" that did well in 1989.
   Mr. Salvigsen, a former chief investment strategist for
Merrill Lynch, presented the bear case for both stocks and
bonds. As he did in May 1987, when he published a report
titled "That Ain't Mud on Your Boots, Partner," Mr. Salvigsen
called stocks "quite expensive." An apt title for a report on
stocks today would be "These Dogs Won't Hunt," he said.
   Hurting bond prices in Mr. Salvigsen's view will be a
liquidity crisis pushing up interest rates during the year,
as companies increase their borrowing to offset declining
profits and state, federal and foreign governments all
encounter increased financing needs. Still lurking is the
final cost of the savings and loan bailout, a "big black
hole" that has been underestimated so far, he says.
   Mr. Salvigsen's kind words for gold aren't prompted by
fear of rising prices. "Our inflation expectations aren't
high," he says. Holding some gold makes sense in his view
because "when people see things deflating around them, they
cleave to gold."
