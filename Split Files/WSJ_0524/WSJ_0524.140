   TOKYO -- Japan Air Lines said it plans to place an order
for 20 new Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets, with an option to buy
an additional 34 at a later date.
   The total order, which would have a value of $8.53
billion, would bring JAL's 747-400 fleet up to 74 aircraft.
Each 747-400 costs an estimated 24 billion yen ($158
million).

   At the end of March, JAL placed an order for 10 MD-11
jetliners from McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $2 billion,
with an option to by 10 more at a later date.
   "If we don't order them in a timely enough matter, we
might have trouble getting aircraft later on," said a Jal
official.
   JAL has taken delivery of five 747-400's and has another
15 of this latest version on order. In addition, JAL has
bought 63 conventional 747 aircraft since 1970.
   With Japan's new wealth, air travel is booming. While the
nation's airports are clogged and operating at capacity,
completion of a new international airport in Osaka and
expansion of Tokyo's two airports, Narita and Haneda,
represents significant opportunity for expansion, JAL said.
People in the airline industry expect the growth rate for
Japanese domestic and international air travel to reach 6% a
year for the next 10 years.
