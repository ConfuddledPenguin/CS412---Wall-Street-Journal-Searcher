   FRANKFURT -- West Germany's production of automobiles slid
in April, signaling a flattening of the robust growth in car
demand of the past couple years.
   Output by West German auto manufacturers was down 8% in
the latest reporting month to 378,000 units from 412,926 a
year earlier, the German Auto Industry Association said.
April's decline in output occurred as exports of German autos
slackened.

   Auto analysts had been expecting the European car market
to be soft this year, although West Germany had been
relatively resilient in the first quarter. The association
did note, however, that there was one less day of production
last month than in April 1989.
