   EXECUTIVES WHO PILOT their own planes for business or
pleasure went an estimated 540,000 miles out of their way
last year to help the sick.
   These flying good Samaritans are members of AirLifeLine, a
nonprofit association devoted to airlifting, without charge,
medical supplies and patients who otherwise couldn't afford
such a service. Last year, AirLifeLine pilots, flying
everything from propeller-driven Cessnas to Citation jets,
undertook 545 such missions, down from 698 in 1988 but well
above the 36 missions flown by 30 pilots in 1980, the group's
first full year of operation.
   AirLifeLine is the brainchild of Thomas W. Goodwin, owner
of Central Valley Press, a Sacramento, Calif., printing
company. "While I was airport-hopping with my own plane I
noticed how many private planes were sitting idly on the
ground," he recalls. "I thought maybe a way could be found to
use hobbyist pilots and their air machines to do something
for people and medicine."
   Today, 336 licensed private pilots located around the U.S.
participate. The group's roster had reached 700 in 1985, when
there were "too many pilots and not enough missions," recalls
Mr. Goodwin. So that year, when he decided the group should
carry needy patients as well as supplies, he added the
requirement that each volunteer have at least 200 hours of
flying experience (there wasn't a flight-hour requisite
previously) and liability insurance.
   AirLifeLine isn't an air ambulance service: It won't
handle stretcher cases and isn't equipped for in-flight
emergencies.
   To get a ride, patients must have a statement from a
public agency that they are in financial need and a letter
from their doctor or health facility that a medical emergency
exists and that they are able to fly. Patients or their
parents (most of the cases involve children) must also sign a
waiver freeing the pilot of responsibility in case of a
mishap.
   These pilots -- whose regular jobs range from stock
trading to trucking -- often fly after working hours,
donating their free time and such costs as fuel and landing
fees, totaling about $170,000 last year.
   The missions are often cooperative efforts, involving two
pilots. In March, for instance, AirLifeLine took 16-year-old
Girts Karnitis, a Latvian in need of special heart surgery,
from Ottawa, where the youth and his mother waited with
special visas, to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   On the first leg, Robert Gordon, a 40-mission veteran of
AirLifeLine when he isn't running his West Hills, N.Y., valve
supply company, picked up the pair at noon and flew them in
his Beechcraft Baron to Detroit. There, David Jack, a
Minneapolis telephone engineer, flew the two 650 miles on to
Rochester in his small Mooney, landing at 6:30 p.m. Within
hours, doctors had successfully operated on Girts.
   It cost Mr. Jack $400 and seven hours of his time, "But,
oh, yes, it was worth it," he said. "A successful outcome
makes it all the better," he added. "I feel I have been
blessed by aviation and this is my way of paying a bit back."
   AirLifeLine's Sacramento headquarters, with a five-member
staff and a computer bank of telephone and fax numbers,
handles all contacts with the pilots. Up to seven pilots may
be called before one is found who's available for a mission.
   AirLifeLine's administrative costs last year were $75,800.
Most was covered by corporate donations and proceeds from a
golf tournament. The pilots themselves donated $6,800.
