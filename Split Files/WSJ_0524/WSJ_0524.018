   SAN DIEGO -- Nancy Hoover Hunter, former girlfriend and
business partner of convicted swindler J. David Dominelli,
pleaded guilty to four felony charges in exchange for
immunity from further criminal prosecution.
   Mrs. Hunter, 51 years old, pleaded guilty in federal court
here to single counts of mail fraud and lying to a
Commodities Futures Trading Commission agent. She also
pleaded guilty to two counts of selling unregistered
securities in connection with a currency-trading scam that
bilked investors out of about $80 million.

   Neither Mrs. Hunter nor her two attorneys could
immediately be reached for comment.
   The charges stemmed from money Mrs. Hunter received from
Mr. Dominelli, who is serving a 20-year sentence for
admittedly masterminding the scheme. Mrs. Hunter was an
executive in J. David &amp; Co., La Jolla, Calif., from 1979
until 1984, when the firm was forced into bankruptcy.
   Under the plea agreement, Mrs. Hunter won't spend any more
time in prison than the 10-year sentence she received in
March for tax evasion related to her former links with Mr.
Dominelli. Jury selection was to have started Tuesday for her
retrial on 192 counts; the first panel of jurors had
deadlocked.
