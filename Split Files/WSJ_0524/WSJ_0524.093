   Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh charged an
average of $95,185 to repair or replace a heart valve during
a recent quarter. Across town, Mercy Hospital did the same
procedure for $48,559.
   Elsewhere in Southwestern Pennsylvania, 14 of 53 patients
who suffered a stroke died at Latrobe Area Hospital, while
all 32 similar patients at Armstrong County Hospital
survived.

   Publication of these and other ostensible disparities
among Pennsylvania hospitals has catapulted the state to the
forefront of a national movement to bring consumer buying
power to the health-care market. For the first time,
consumers -- particularly major companies, government
agencies and insurers who pay for health care -- can compare
hospitals on price and performance, much as people compare
mileage ratings, service records and sticker prices when they
shop for cars. The implications for the nation's health-care
system are huge.
   "This development is going to totally transform the
delivery of care," says Jan Weiss, senior vice president for
health care at Standard &amp; Poor's. Employers, insurers, health
maintenance organizations and federal health-care programs
"are going to direct their subscribers to those facilities
that provide the best outcome for the least cost," says Mr.
Weiss. "It's going to force everybody to change their way of
practicing medicine."
   Not surprisingly, it's also provoking a brawl between
hospitals, who say the data in their current form are
misleading and full of flaws, and their major customers,
particularly Big Business, who are rubbing their hands in
anticipation of a new tool to contain soaring health-care
bills.
   Yesterday, the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment
Council released data comparing 37 Pittsburgh area hospitals
on 55 common hospital procedures performed during the fourth
quarter of 1988. Third in a series of reports prepared by the
council, the report was the first to focus on a major
metropolitan area. The area contains both internationally
known hospitals and some of the nation's largest purchasers
of health care, including such companies as Westinghouse
Corp., USX Corp. and Aluminum Co. of America.
   The presence of these players has raised the stakes and
heightened national interest in what amounts to a major
experiment in health-care reform. "People are really waiting
to see what happens in Pennsylvania," says Lisa Iezzoni, a
physician and health-care researcher at Harvard Medical
School.
   Other agencies, including the U.S. Health Care Financing
Administration, have published reports on hospital death
rates or on costs, but the Pennsylvania effort is by far the
most comprehensive effort to compile information on cost,
death rates and complication rates by region and by hospital
-- and identify them by name.
   Hospitals are so concerned that they pre-empted
yesterday's release with a news conference of their own on
Monday to debunk the report. "The usability and reliability
of the data have been overstated," says Jack C. Robinette,
president of the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania.
"It has very little use."
   Among other flaws, he says, listings of hospital charges
are "meaningless," because they aren't standardized. And
information related to deaths and complications fails to
account for age, whether a patient has terminal illness, and
the presence of complicating problems such as heart disease.
"There's no way it can define quality," he says. "All it can
do is raise broad questions."
   Another problem is that the report covers procedures
performed during one three-month period 18 months ago. "This
is one quarter," says Ray Sarver, associate medical director
at Latrobe Hospital. "Make sure you don't over-interpret it."
   Indeed, the cluster of deaths related to stroke and brain
hemorrhage reported at his hospital "was a quarterly
phenomenon," he said, and reflected at least one patient
transferred from another hospital on a respirator. None of
the deaths were preventable, he said. At the same time, the
report lists Latrobe as one of the best performers when it
comes to complications. In that regard, "We had a good
quarter, that's for sure," he said.
   In releasing the data, the council cautioned that although
three months was long enough to spot the beginning of trends,
the accumulation of a year or more of experience is necessary
before the reports are truly useful in evaluating hospital
performance. "I don't think anybody should make any
significant decisions off this first report," says Richard
Ekstrom, manager, health benefits at Westinghouse. Once
quarter-to-quarter and annual comparisons are available, he
expects the data to be more valuable.
   "The data aren't perfect," says John Dankosky, executive
director, Pennsylvania Business Roundtable, which represents
chief executives of 42 major companies. "But you've got to
start someplace."
   Underlying the report is a computerized analysis system,
based on more than four million medical records, developed by
MediQual Systems Inc., Westboro, Mass. Among other things, it
is designed to measure a patient's response to treatment
during the hospital stay, and to adjust for differences in
overall patient health and other factors that could skew the
information.
   Despite their concerns, hospitals have already used the
data to review internal operations. One in another section of
the state that scored low in an earlier report later made a
public commitment to improve quality.
   Meanwhile, corporations have big plans for the data. At
USX, Jim Carney, vice president, benefits administration,
said the company will visit hospital administrators to
discuss cost and quality issues raised in the report. "We
don't want to favor one hospital over another," he said. "But
why should our employees pay an inefficient provider when
somebody else will give you an equally good result" at lower
cost?
   Hershey Foods Corp., Hershey, Pa., plans to disseminate
the information to employees to encourage them to choose
efficient and high quality hospitals. For instance, a report
issued earlier covering the Hershey area noted that costs for
normal childbirth among about 15 hospitals ranged from $864
to $2,180, with no apparent differences in outcomes.
   Health data agencies in 30 states are keeping watch on
developments in Pennsylvania, which is one reason health-care
experts and business leaders expect cost and quality reports
will eventually help reshape the health-care marketplace
nationwide. Strong performers will use them as part of
marketing campaigns to lure patients from hospitals with poor
results. They will accelerate the trend among companies and
insurers to develop so-called preferred provider networks and
then provide benefit incentives to encourage employees to use
the network for health care. Now, acknowledges Dr. Sarver of
Latrobe Hospital, "Benefits managers are out buying health
care, and they've got nothing to go on."
   The data are also expected to be important to hospital
accreditation and even to bond ratings. "This is the
beginning of a very long-term trend," says Standard &amp; Poor's
Mr. Weiss. "Hospitals that focus on it in a meaningful way
are going to position themselves to be in the forefront eight
or 10 years from now."
   Meanwhile, the information is certain to raise questions
and provoke discussions between providers and consumers, an
exercise that in itself could help improve health care. At
Allegheny General, a spokesman said the $95,185 average
charge for heart valve work reflected some exceptionally ill
patients, including one who died after 144 days in the
hospital. Overall, he said, the hospital's cardiac services
proved to be both medically and cost effective.
   At Westinghouse, Mr. Ekstrom looked at the high heart
valve charge data at Allegheny General with skepticism,
especially, he noted, when the average charge for a similar
procedure at the hospital is listed at $43,451. "It looks
goofy to me," Mr. Ekstrom says. "You and I shouldn't go and
get our valves done until we get a little more knowledge.
That's the process that will develop."
