   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported that rising aviation
fuel prices were partly responsible for a 9% drop in net
income in its year ended March 31.
   Although the results are only preliminary, the Dutch
airline said earnings fell to 340 million guilders ($181
million) from 374 million guilders in fiscal 1989. The
company will issue final figures June 13.

   KLM also said its earnings were hurt by higher levels of
depreciation and an increase in financial expenses.
   Despite the drop in net, the Dutch airline reported a
revenue gain of 8.3% to 6.5 billion guilders from 6 billion
guilders.
   Operating profit before interest payments fell to 310
million guilders from 390 million guilders in fiscal 1989.
