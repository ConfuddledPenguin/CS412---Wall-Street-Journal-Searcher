   Small U.S. Contractors
   Trail in Drug Efforts

   FIFTEEN MONTHS after federal regulations demanding
drug-free workplaces for federal contractors took effect,
small businesses trail in compliance.
   "I'd guess maybe half of the small employers that have to
develop a drug-free workplace policy under federal law
haven't done so," says Bill Jones, a Potomac Electric Power
Co. executive on loan to the Corporation Against Drug Abuse,
a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group that helps companies
develop anti-drug policies.
   Many business owners say they are confused about what is
required. Companies involved in transportation or
national-defense work must adopt a drug-testing program for
employees. But most federal contractors aren't in this
category and thus have a less complex task.
   As a condition of their government contract, they must
simply make a "good-faith effort" to maintain a drug-free
workplace. This means drafting an official drug-abuse policy
and communicating it effectively to workers. Posting a notice
on the bulletin board isn't enough. Authorities say the
government wants to see evidence of regular communication,
such as seminars, posters, items in company newsletters and
anti-drug notices in paychecks.
   Also, a contractor must tell the government if an employee
is convicted of drug-law violations that occurred on the job
and take sanctions against the worker. The rules don't cover
alcohol abuse.
   Once they master such details, some companies praise the
new law. "My first reaction was, `Oh, no. Not another
program,'" says Laura Henderson, president of Prospect
Associates, a Rockville, Md., health-care consulting firm
whose major client is the National Institutes of Health.
   But on reflection, Ms. Henderson says, the law "focused me
on the fact that the workplace is where we may be able to
have an impact on the drug problem." The law's required paper
work "isn't onerous," she says. "It's just one more thing a
small company has to do."
                                                                                                       

   Many Manufacturers
   Expect a Profitable Year
                                                                                                       

   SMALL manufacturers in this country say their profit out
look is bright.
   Some 46% of manufacturers surveyed for the accounting firm
Grant Thornton said they expect their profits this year to
exceed 1989 levels. Grant Thornton said 36% predicted flat
earnings; only 18% said profits will decline.
   "Although manufacturers differ on the likelihood of a
recession, their optimistic profit outlook reflects a belief
in the strength of their companies to withstand a slowing of
the economy," says Michael N. Cantwell, who oversees Grant
Thornton's surveys of manufacturers. For the latest survey,
conducted in February and released in April, the New York
firm had Wirthlin Group of McLean, Va., interview 250
representative manufacturers with sales between $10 million
and $200 million a year.
   According to the survey, 36% of the respondents expect
inflation to increase this year; only 5% expect it to
decrease.
   Industrial-goods makers were twice as likely as
consumer-goods producers to predict lower profits. Firms with
sales under $20 million a year were less likely than others
to predict higher profits.
                                                                                                       

   Both Sexes Are Drawn
   To Working at Home
                                                                                                       

   AN entrepreneur's place often is in the home. More than
37% of female entrepreneurs and 33% of male entrepreneurs
responding to a recent nationwide survey say they work from
home.
   The reason given most often by women is competing domestic
demands, such as taking care of children or household chores.
   "I like the low overhead, the convenience and the ease of
childrearing," says Ann Ensley, who runs a specialty
advertising company, Lateral Lines, out of her home in Grand
Junction, Colo. Likewise, Sheila Larsen says she started an
upholstery business in her home in Federal Way, Wash., five
years ago "so I could stay home with my kids."
   Most of the male respondents say they like working at home
because operating costs are minimal, they don't have to
commute and can dress casually.
   In the survey, United Group Information Services, an
affiliate of Texas health insurer United Group Associates,
polled 20,400 businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Male
business owners outnumbered female owners nearly 4 to 1.
   In a separate study of 1,080 entrepreneurs, United Group
found that 75% of the women and 67% of the men thought it was
best to build new businesses from scratch rather than to
acquire companies. Both sexes agreed that being your own boss
and having a sense of independence are the main reasons to
become an entrepreneur. Only 1.6% of women and 4.1% of men
said they do it for the money.
   United Group found that female entrepreneurs work an
average of 46.5 hours a week, 10 fewer than men. Unmarried
females work more hours than married women, while single men
put in fewer hours running their businesses than married men.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   LEGISLATIVE Information Network Corp. of Austin, Texas, is
developing a data bank enabling lobbyists and others to
search the texts of state-level legislative proposals. The
service will be accessible from personal computers and is to
begin operating this fall. Data initially will be available
from at least three states. . . . Almost half of
second-generation members of family businesses are
dissatisfied with their jobs, according to a Baylor
University survey that was reported in Family Business
magazine. Family-related conflicts were largely to blame.
