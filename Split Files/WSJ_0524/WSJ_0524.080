   CHICAGO -- Global futures trading moved a step closer to
reality as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade said they would combine their planned
after-hours automated futures trading systems.
   The combined trading system, to begin in November, will
put futures traders years ahead of U.S. stock market
investors in terms of around-the-clock access to their
markets. It also underscores the Chicago exchanges' position
as the leading innovators among U.S. stock and futures
exchanges. By comparison, the New York Stock Exchange says it
continues to study the possibility of an after-hours trading
system and potential customer demand for such a product.

   With both Chicago futures exchanges united behind a common
after-hours trading system, foreign exchanges may decide it
would be too time-consuming and expensive to launch rival
systems. If foreign exchanges decide to pass on automated
trading, or link with the Chicago system, it could reverse
the trend of recent years in which the Chicago exchanges have
seen their dominant share of international futures trading
volume slowly being eroded by foreign competitors.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee
and the leading proponent of automated trading, called the
agreement to combine the systems "an historic and monumental
milestone in the development of futures trade."
   The combination is a victory for the Merc's Globex trading
system, which will absorb the Board of Trade's planned rival
trading system, called Aurora. The resulting system will
retain the Globex name and its plan for electronically
matching buy and sell orders entered from computer terminals
around the world into a central computer here. Reuters
Holdings PLC is the Merc's partner in developing Globex and
is still negotiating with the exchanges on integrating the
Board of Trade into the system.
   Globex has already received regulatory approval from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and yesterday the Merc
received approval from Japanese regulators to install Globex
terminals in Japan.
   Board of Trade insiders said the Merc's regulatory lead
and the prohibitive cost of building a rival system persuaded
the CBOT to allow a friendly takeover of its Aurora system by
Globex. Plans for Globex were unveiled in 1987, but the Board
of Trade didn't respond with plans for Aurora until last
year. In mid-1989, the two exchanges began exploring the
possibility of linking the two systems.
   A senior official at a Board of Trade member firm also
said that the exchange worried its system might not pass
muster with the CFTC because of fears that Aurora might be
ripe for manipulation. On Globex, orders will be anonymously
matched by a central computer. But the Board of Trade's
Aurora system was designed to allow exchange members to
specify that trades be made with certain other members whose
trading icons would be identified on a computer screen.
   Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, Board of Trade chairman, said in
a statement announcing the combination that "the resulting
cost efficiencies and savings will benefit both exchanges,
their memberships and the market users."
   What the Board of Trade brings to the system is the most
actively traded futures contract in the country: futures on
U.S. Treasury bonds, which account for more than half of the
Board of Trade's daily trading volume. Treasury bond futures
are also increasingly traded by Japanese financial
institutions, which hold billions of dollars of U.S. Treasury
bonds.
   "Treasury bonds are an essential product in making the
system work," said Mr. Melamed. Board of Trade officials
declined to comment beyond the joint announcement by the
exchanges.
   One Board of Trade member emphasized that the exchange's 6
p.m. to 9:30 p.m. evening trading session in Chicago, where
most of the activity is in Treasury bond futures, will
continue even though such futures will be included in the
combined after-hours system.
   "That's the one thing we've done during the past four
years that's amounted to anything," the Board of Trade member
said. The evening trading session began in early 1987.
   Also initially included on the system will be the Merc's
foreign currency futures and Eurodollar futures, which are
widely used by overseas institutions.
   Currently, a relatively small amount of "off-exchange"
stock and futures trading takes place after exchange trading
hours in the U.S. and overseas.
   Globex will start trading in Chicago, New York and London
in November. Terminals will be added in Japan once the
exchanges are assured they have removed any glitches from the
system, Mr. Melamed said.
   The Merc has already reached an agreement to link Globex
with the French futures exchange Marche a Terme International
de France, or Matif, in Paris. Talks regarding links with
other foreign futures markets have been put on hold pending
the resolution of the Merc-Board of Trade negotiations.
   Mr. Melamed said the Merc hoped to begin negotiating with
Japanese futures exchanges about listing certain of their
contracts on Globex after the system is operational in that
country.
   He said he expected it would take several months before
the Globex system generated a significant amount of trading
volume.
   "We're talking about a new system and new trading times.
It will not be an immediate house on fire," he said.
