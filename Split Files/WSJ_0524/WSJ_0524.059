   The current interest in President Bush's likely decision
to extend most-favored-nation trading status for China draws
attention to a place and problem that many people would just
as soon forget -- Hong Kong. Come 1997, this flourishing
island of people is scheduled to disappear into the maw of
the Chinese Communists, under the terms of an agreement with
Britain. It of course will be acutely embarrassing to the
free world and especially Britain if Hong Kong's worst fears
come to pass.
   So it's good to see Hong Kong's governor, Sir David
Wilson, speak up on behalf of the Crown Colony as eloquently
as he did in an address Monday before the Asia Society in New
York. Sir David concisely summed up some of the benefits of
trade, not least with China. He argued well that America
should understand how a decision not to renew MFN trading
status for China would hurt Hong Kong's economy.

   It would have been even better, however, had Sir David
begun standing up for Hong Kong's interests about three years
ago, when he first arrived at Queen's Pier to take up the
office of governor.
   In focusing on trade Sir David makes the crucial point
that free markets don't last long without accompanying
political freedoms. He mentions that the 1984 Sino-British
Joint Declaration "laid down clear policies for the
continuation of Hong Kong's existing systems, institutions,
rights and freedoms, for 50 years beyond 1997 and for the
administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people."
   What Sir David doesn't mention is precisely how those Hong
Kong people will be selected to run the place. It won't
exactly be democratic. Though he speaks with apparent pride
of the direct elections due to be held next year for the
first time, he doesn't mention that this will apply to only
20 out of 60 seats in the legislature. Or that Hong Kong's
chief executive -- the person who will step into Sir David's
shoes -- will be subject to approval by Beijing.
   The Joint Declaration promised specifically that Hong
Kong's legislature was to be "constituted by elections" to
help provide a "high degree of autonomy" after the 1997
takeover by China. The idea was to provide some insulation
against China's communist tryanny, by letting Hong Kong's
people choose legislators who would answer first to Hong
Kong, not to Beijing.
   To get a system of representative government up and
running, with even a prayer of survival, it was clearly
necessary for Britain to lead the way. Instead, Britain has
accepted its cue from China, and held any democratic
development to a pathetic minimum.
   There have been no full elections, not even a referendum
on the issue. Neither has there been a referendum on China's
Basic Law that is to govern Hong Kong after 1997. There has
been, in sum, no significant amelioration of the despotic
powers held by the colonial government -- which in the hands
of British democrats fortunately have remained benign. Under
China, such good fortune looks so unlikely that, as Sir David
noted, 42,000 Hong Kong people emigrated last year.
   It's possible, of course, that the next seven years will
see a democratic revolution in China, which would preserve
Hong Kong's freedoms. But it seems reckless for so prudent a
man as David Wilson to gamble the future of Hong Kong's six
million people on such a long shot. Somehow it would seem to
us far less reckless, even at this late date, to go ahead
with full elections in the colony.
