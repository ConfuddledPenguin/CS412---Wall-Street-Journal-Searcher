   Del Webb Corp., Phoenix, Ariz., said a preliminary report
of inspectors of election for its May 16 annual meeting
indicated that a nonbinding shareholder resolution to remove
the company's anti-takeover provisions was approved by
shareholders.
   The proposal by Los Angeles-based Webbcott Holdings, which
owns a 9.7% stake in Webb and is controlled by director James
L. Cotter, requested that the board redeem shareholder rights
issued under a "poison pill" plan adopted last year. Del Webb
said 50.4% of the common stock outstanding voted for the
resolution.

estate development concern's board will consider all options
and will make a report to the board regarding the resolution.
