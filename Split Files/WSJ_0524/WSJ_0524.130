   Richton International Corp., a jewelry concern, said it
expects to report a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter and a
profit for the year.
   For the year-earlier quarter, ended April 30, Richton
posted a loss of $3.2 million, or $1.16 a share, including a
$2.9 million one-time charge related to the downsizing of its
New York office. Net sales were $5.4 million. For fiscal
1989, it posted a loss of almost $3 million, or $1.07 a
share, on net sales of $30.5 million.
