   NEW YORK -- Stock prices, which were down most of the day,
eked out a last-minute gain in reaction to the volatile bond
market's midafternoon advances.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.03 points to close
at 2856.26, its third consecutive record high, in active
trading. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices finished
modestly higher -- up 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of
face amount -- in heavy trading. The dollar gained against
the mark and the yen.

   Helping push bond prices higher against periodic waves of
profit-taking were lower commodity prices, particularly gold,
and an economic report that confirmed the economy is slowing.
Durable goods orders in April fell a bit more than had been
expected. This news reinforced views that inflation isn't
getting out of hand. Inflation reduces bonds' investment
appeal.
   Heavy buying by foreign investors also fueled the
bond-market rally, as did comments in Washington that
government borrowing to fund the thrift bailout shouldn't
affect interest rates. Finally, some traders speculated that
some of the money Saudi Arabia raised by selling gold in
London may have found its way into U.S. Treasury securities.
   The stock market tracked bonds much of the day. Along with
the industrial average, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index posted their
first gains of the day in the last half hour of trading.
   "Bonds definitely took stocks higher at the last minute,"
said Susan Del Signore, trading vice president at Hartford,
Conn.-based Travelers Investment Management.
   Paul Hennessey, vice president of equities trading at
Boston Co., said the stock market is holding up well and may
inch higher in the next few days. "There's so much money
still on the sidelines looking for an opportunity to get into
the market," he said. But looking further down the road -- a
week to 10 days -- Mr. Hennessey expects a drop of about 100
points.
   After that, he suggests, investors and analysts will look
for fresh signals of the market's next move. For one thing,
he says, "we'll begin to look at where we are in terms of
corporate profits at the end of the second quarter."
   Wayne Wong, managing director in charge of fixed-income
investing at Marinvest, foresees a 200-point correction in
the industrial average just around the corner. He thinks bond
prices will tread water until a clearer picture of the
economy emerges.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in active trading, with 172.3 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners, 761 to 745.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.57%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained slightly. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6765 marks and 151.45 yen, compared
with 1.6736 marks and 151.20 yen Tuesday.
