   ATLANTA -- Contel Cellular Inc. said it signed a
joint-venture agreement with Hungaria Telekom Kft. to design,
build and operate a national cellular telephone system in
Hungary.
   The venture will be owned 50% by Contel Cellular and 50%
by private Hungarian investors with Hungaria Telekom. Contel
Cellular, however, will have principal management, technical
and operational responsibility, and expects to name a
managing director and other top personnel soon. Contel
Cellular is 90%-owned by Contel Corp.

   Contel said the venture is strategically important. Contel
Corp. Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said the Hungarian system,
which uses the same bandwidth as a system in neighboring
Austria, "will provide Contel Cellular with a pre-eminent
entry into the Central European market."
   Contel said that it expects to provide service to at least
50,000 subscribers by 1993 and that it eventually could serve
the all of Hungary's 10.6 million citizens. The company
estimates costs will total about $35 million in the first
three years.
   The venture, which would be the first national cellular
system in Eastern Europe, needs approval by the Coordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, an
organization of the U.S. and 16 allies that coordinates
policy on exports to communist countries. The U.S. has
proposed easing Cocom rules to allow the export of all but
the most sophisticated telecommunications equipment, and the
liberalization is likely to be approved at a high-level Cocom
meeting in Paris next month.
   The Hungarian government gave the Contel-Hungaria Telekom
project an operating concession for 15 years, with a
five-year renewal option that expires in 2010. Contel said
the venture will construct the system beginning in Budapest,
where it faces competition from another venture involving U S
West Inc., a Denver-based regional Bell telephone company
that has a 49% stake in a venture that plans to develop a
cellular system in Budapest. The U S West project also is
subject to Cocom approval.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Contel shares closed at $27.75, down 12.5 cents.
