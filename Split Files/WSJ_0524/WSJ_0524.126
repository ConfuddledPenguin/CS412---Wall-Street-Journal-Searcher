   WASHINGTON -- Congressional and White House negotiators
agreed to pick up the pace of budget summit talks after
Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess.
   "It's important that we get over the seminar stage and
into the negotiating stage within a brief period," White
House Budget Director Richard Darman said. "If they {the
talks} drag on and on, it tends to defeat the purpose."

   At a meeting yesterday, Mr. Darman and the congressional
coordinators of the talks, House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) and Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.), scheduled
morning and afternoon sessions for June 6 and 7, aides said.
Their hope is to finish reviewing deficit forecasts and
previously proposed deficit-reduction plans at those sessions
or, if necessary, at another session on June 12.
   After that, Mr. Darman said, "I would hope we get down to
talking about possible compromises." Democrats insist the
next step is for the administration to offer a solution to
the deficit problem they have been outlining, but it isn't
clear the administration is willing to go along.
   So far, the talks have been taking place only for two or
three hours Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. They continue
this afternoon. Congress isn't in session next week.
