   WASHINGTON -- Overall conditions in the nation's nursing
homes have improved, but many homes for the elderly fall
short of standards for handling food and drugs, the
government reported in its second annual survey.
   The 93-volume survey gives individual reports on 15,600
nursing homes that receive payments from Medicare and
Medicaid, the federal health plans for the elderly, disabled
or poor. Officials of the nursing home industry warned that
the reports, issued to help potential patients and their
families choose facilities, can give misleading impressions
about the quality of care because they fail to make
distinctions about the severity of deficiencies.

   The reports show that although most facilities comply with
federal requirements, the inspectors found many problems
during their certification surveys of facilities. For
instance, the reports show that more than a third of the
homes failed to meet federal requirements that food be
"stored, refrigerated, prepared, distributed and served under
sanitary conditions" and that more than 20% didn't administer
drugs "according to the written orders of the attending
physicians."
   Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration in the Department of Health and Human
Services, acknowledged that "there are limitations to the
information contained in these volumes." She stressed,
however, that "we're very concerned about the quality of care
in nursing homes."
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American
Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes,
warned that the data in the reports give an incomplete and
subjective picture of nursing home conditions. The profiles
of each nursing home give information on only 32 of the some
500 requirements that inspectors check.
   The Health Care Financing Association also drew criticism
for its enforcement efforts. The reports show a "shameful
failure of our government to enforce decent standards of
quality in American nursing homes," charged Elma Holder, the
executive director of the National Citizen's Coalition for
Nursing Home Reform. Last year, the HCFA barred some 80
nursing homes from receiving federal funds after finding that
they failed to meet federal standards. Ms. Holder said that
the small number of terminations shows that "enforcement is
the exception rather than the rule in the nursing home
licensure and certification system."
   The HCFA is issuing tougher nursing home regulations, as
required by a 1987 law. New rules to protect patients go into
effect Oct. 1. The HCFA recently proposed requirements for
training nurses aides and preadmission screening and, in a
few months, the agency plans to propose new enforcement
penalties.
   Mrs. Wilensky said the HCFA's latest nursing home reports
will be widely available in libraries, local congressional
offices, some Social Security offices, and in regional
offices of the American Association of Retired Persons.
