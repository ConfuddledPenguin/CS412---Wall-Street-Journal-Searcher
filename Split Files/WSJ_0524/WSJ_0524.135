   Tokyo stock prices posted a healthy advance Wednesday,
encouraged by the yen's strength against the dollar, with the
key Nikkei index finishing above 32000 for the first time in
three days.
   London share prices closed mostly lower in moderate
trading, as disappointing British trade data for April erased
gains made early in the session and sharply pushed the
100-share index to near its intraday low.

   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up
238.21 points, to finish at 32176.51. Helped by buying linked
to index-futures arbitrage, the index moved as high as 32316
in midafternoon, before falling back 140 points on
profit-taking toward the end of the day, traders said.
   At midmorning Thursday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was down
56.47 points to 32120.04.
   Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 650
million shares, improving from 549 million shares a day
earlier. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which gained 19.77 points Tuesday, was up
4.36 at 2394.95.
   Traders said growing expectations for stability in the
currency and bond markets for the time being encouraged
buying. Also good news to the market were recent upward moves
on overseas stock markets, including Wall Street, said Shigeo
Sekimoto, general manager of stock trading at Yamaichi
Securities. "The sentiment is very positive," he said.
   The Nikkei index hovered at lower levels last week, after
posting fast-paced advances. But participants appeared to
have agreed that the market has spent enough time on "speed
adjustment," Mr. Sekimoto said. Institutions, many of which
had been following a strategy of selling whenever stock
prices went up, are gradually beginning to participate in
active buying, he said.
   But some traders said further sharp advances on the Nikkei
will take time, as the market doesn't have a strong trading
focus.
   Many large-capital issues that advanced in the morning on
the yen's strength fell back by the end of the day,
indicating that the room these stocks have to move up is
hardly more than what can be considered a technical
correction, a trader at Wako Securities said.
   Shares of shipbuilding companies were bought ahead of
Friday earnings reports for the fiscal year ended March 31,
which investors expect to be strong, traders said.
   Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries rose 50 yen to 1,140
yen ($7.53), and Hitachi Zosen gained 19 to 868.
   Electrical concerns gained moderately, helped by active
buying by the so-called Big Four brokerage houses, traders
said.
   Toshiba was up 20 at 1,090. Sanyo Electric gained 27 to
956, and Kokusai Electric rose 40 to 5,130.
   Among other winners were Konica, up 80 at 1,490, and
Misawa Homes, which rose 100 to 2,570.
   Steel shares were mixed. NKK was up 5 at 646, while Nippon
Steel fell 6 to 618.
   Chubu Electric Power rose 60 to 3,760. But Kansai Electric
Power edged down 20 to 3,900.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index finished down 23.9 points at 2287.4, a touch above its
low for the day of 2287.3, which was reached just before
midafternoon. The intraday high of 2335.1 was posted prior to
midday and to the release of the trade figures. The FT
30-share index was down 19.5 points at 1810.0. Volume was a
healthy 542.1 million shares, compared with the 629.7 million
issues that changed hands a day earlier.
   London's market started firmer on strength in stock-index
futures contracts, dealers said, but the release of the trade
data triggered a gradual decline that lasted throughout the
day; Britain's trade balance for April showed a deficit of
#1.78 billion ($3.01 billion), wider than market expectations
for a #1.5 billion gap. Traders also reported some
profit-taking that helped ease prices, and said a weak start
on Wall Street didn't help matters.
   Some dealers said they still detected both bears seeking
to cover short positions and investors interested in fresh
buying. They predicted that the market might pick up before
the weekend.
   A slew of corporate results hit the market, causing varied
responses. Ranks Hovis McDougall, a food company, plunged 38
pence to 360 pence ($6.09) after reporting a slim 0.2% rise
in pretax profit for its first six months, while issuing a
warning for fiscal-year earnings. Bass, a beverage company,
posted the biggest gain on the day, rising 14 pence to #10.63
($17.99), on a 9.8% increase in interim pretax profit. B.A.T
Industries, a tobacco and financial services conglomerate,
fell 8 to 684, after a 27% dive in first-quarter pretax
profit from losses at its British insurance unit. Courtaulds,
an industrial materials concern, lost 10 to 328 on
profit-taking, following the announcement that pretax profit
rose a slim 5% for the year, at the top end of analysts'
expectations.
   A number of blue-chip stocks showed sharp downward
movement in sympathy with the market, but most of them
registered thin trading volume. Barclays Bank shed 5 to 554,
amid a general softness in the banking sector. The
pharmaceutical company Wellcome dived 28 to 661.
   Gainers on the day included the lubricants company Burmah,
which rose 9 to 626; the automotive and defense concern Lucas
Industries added 11 to 633; and Great Universal Stores gained
8 to 969.
   The retailer Kingfisher closed up 3 at 311, after
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry blocked its
long-running hostile bid for rival retailer Dixons, which
dropped 7 to 124.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm, and lower in
Milan. Frankfurt prices jumped 1%, reversing a steady
two-week downturn, but traders said that volume remained
light, that technical factors played a large role in the
gains, and that they weren't optimistic the market's
consolidation has ended. South African gold stocks closed
lower.
   Stock prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul;
lower in Singapore and Manila; and mixed in Sydney and
Wellington. In Hong Kong, stocks surged 1.9% in the heaviest
trading in 3 1/2 months, as overseas buyers swooped into the
market in a delayed response to the report the U.S. would
renew China's preferential trade status; the Hang Seng Index
soared 57.44 points to 3028.31, following a day-earlier surge
of 40.04 points. Taipei share prices staged a technical
rebound, after plunging nearly 1,900 points during the past
five sessions; the weighted index, which fell 272.57 on
Tuesday, recovered 294.08, or 4.38%, to finish at 7014.40. In
Manila, panic selling drove prices lower in active trading,
as investors lost confidence after a renewal of terrorist
activity in the capital.
