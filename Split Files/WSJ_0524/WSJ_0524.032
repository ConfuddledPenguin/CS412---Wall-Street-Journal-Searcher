   WASHINGTON -- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration intensified its investigation into alleged
steering-wheel vibration problems in 1987-1989 model Hyundai
Excels.
   In recent months, the agency and the manufacturer have
received almost 300 complaints about the budget cars, which
are made by Hyundai Motor Corp. of South Korea. Owners allege
that strong vibrations in the steering wheels make the cars
difficult to control at highway speeds. There have been
reports of two accidents and two injuries in connection with
the alleged defect.

   The stepped-up inquiry, which covers 707,000 cars, is
known as an engineering analysis, the second of NHTSA's three
levels of investigation. The agency plans to conduct
additional tests of the cars and to analyze the two reported
accidents.
   The agency also said that it has begun a preliminary
evaluation -- its lowest level investigation -- into alleged
brake problems in 1986-1989 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable
cars. Both are made by Ford Motor Co. The agency has received
two complaints alleging failure of brake disk hubs. About 1.2
million vehicles are covered by the inquiry. No accidents or
injuries have been reported.
