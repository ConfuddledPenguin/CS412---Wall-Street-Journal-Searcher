   Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge I. Raymond Kremer
approved a $13 million settlement on behalf of about 25,000
SmithKline Beckman Corp.'s shareholders on Tuesday.
   The $13 million will be paid pro-rata to shareholders of
SmithKline who held shares between April 10, 1989, and June
26, 1989.

   Last year, several groups of SmithKline shareholders filed
class-action suits, alleging that the company's directors
breached their fiduciary duties by not seeking potential
acquirers willing to pay a higher price than the one offered
by Beecham Group PLC and by placing devices, such as a poison
pill and golden parachutes, in the way of a hostile bid.
SmithKline ultimately merged with Beecham to form SmithKline
Beecham PLC.
   According to the settlement agreement, the defendants
"vigorously deny all liability," but settled in order to
"avoid the substantial expense, inconvenience, and
distraction of continued litigation."
