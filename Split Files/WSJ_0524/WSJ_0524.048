   BAGHDAD, Iraq -- It is news time on state-run television,
and the news, as usual, is Saddam Hussein.
   The lead item of the 25-minute program is a 15-minute
report of the Iraqi president examining his birthday
presents, many of which happen to be portraits of him.
Viewers have previously been treated to scenes of the
53-year-old leader's actual birthday celebration: Iraqis in
Babylonian garb prostrating themselves and chanting, "Your
candles, oh Saddam, are the torches of all the Arabs."

   Such excesses might seem ripe for ridicule in these days
of crumbling dictatorships, but not in Iraq. Here, the
penalty for publicly insulting the president is death. Iraqis
have long known what the rest of the world is only beginning
to understand: Their president is powerful and potentially
very dangerous.
   He also is emerging as the Arab world's single most
influential leader, at a time of heightening regional
tension.
   Mr. Hussein's threat last month to "scorch half of Israel"
with poison gas if it attacks Iraq won wild applause among
Arabs who feel Israel hasn't responded to peaceful overtures.
"Saddam is giving them a chance to say, `We are rich, we are
strong, we are somebody,'" says a Middle East diplomat in
Baghdad.
   On Monday, Mr. Hussein will play host to an Arab summit
here called to oppose immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel
and to repudiate what Iraq calls "a Zionist-inspired
campaign" against Iraq's military buildup. The Middle East
turmoil following an Israeli man's massacre of Palestinians
Sunday is apt to inspire Mr. Hussein further. With the Arab
mood so inflamed, moderate Arab leaders could lose even more
ground to his militancy.
   Iraq is more than just a regional power. The world's
biggest arms buyer over the past five years, it now has about
a million men under arms and 700 combat aircraft, more than
Britain or France. It has a chemical arsenal matched only by
the two superpowers -- and one it isn't afraid to use, as
witness its recent gas attacks on Iranians and on its own
Kurdish minority.
   Iraq also has missiles that can deliver warheads to points
as far away as Tehran or Tel Aviv. Recent U.S. customs
seizures of nuclear triggers suggest as well an advanced
nuclear-arms program, although Baghdad denies this. With oil
reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's, Iraq has ample funds
to continue expanding its military might.
   All this is controlled by a leader who has demonstrated
ruthlessness in his eight-year war with Iran and repression
of his own people in peacetime. His reach extends beyond the
sun-baked boulevards of Baghdad. In London, an exiled Iraqi
dentist named Bayan al-Hakim always carries in his wallet a
dogeared card. In handwritten block letters, it tells how
Iraq has killed 23 members of his family, and gives the name
of a Scotland Yard detective to contact if he, too, is
murdered.
   In 1988, a gunman killed one of Mr. al-Hakim's cousins in
the lobby of the Khartoum Hilton in Sudan, then fled in an
Iraqi embassy car. Sudan asked Iraq to waive diplomatic
immunity to allow the suspect to be questioned, but Iraq
refused. (Earlier this year, the U.S. expelled an Iraqi
diplomat for allegedly plotting to kill an Iraqi dissident in
California.)
   The al-Hakims' troubles began in 1983 because one member
of the family was leading opposition to Iraq from inside
Iran. To pressure him, Iraq arrested almost all his male
relatives. According to Amnesty International, their ages
ranged from nine to 76. Some were executed; others remain in
jail. "Saddam is worse than Ceausescu," says Mr. al-Hakim.
"If he ever falls into the hands of the people, there won't
be film of his corpse like the Romanians showed, because
there won't be a fingernail left to photograph."
   Other Iraqis respond angrily to such criticism, crediting
the president with forging a nation from a chaos of competing
minorities, and with wisely using oil wealth for development.
"In the middle of the war, when every dinar was decisive for
survival, he established four new universities," says Awni
Shaaban, president of Tikrit University. Now, he says, Iraqis
are proud of Mr. Hussein's tough talk. "We were under
imperialist pressure from Ottomans, then British, and we've
been pushed around too much. We won't be dictated to on what
arms we can have."
   Nevertheless, comparisons with the late Romanian dictator
seem apt. To increase Iraq's war-depleted population, Mr.
Hussein bans contraception and prescribes the death penalty
for performing abortions. Like Mr. Ceausescu, Mr. Hussein has
plans for a grandiose new palace. And just as Mr. Ceausescu
demolished ethnic Hungarian villages, Mr. Hussein has
depopulated a swath of Kurdish land, because rebellious Kurds
supported Tehran in the war with Iran.
   Hussain Sinjari, a 27-year-old Kurdish rebel, still makes
risky illegal forays into Iraq, across the porous mountain
border. On his last trip, in December, he says the
devastation he saw was total. Villages had been bulldozed to
dust, mountain springs choked with cement. "I cried when I
saw the dead trees, the dry springs," says the tall, tough
rebel. "You can say that the people were traitors, but what
did the birds do, or the fruit trees?"
   Iraq says the Kurds have been resettled in modern towns
with superior services such as electricity, but the
government didn't respond to a reporter's repeated request to
visit one of the new settlements. "They are nothing but
concentration camps," contends Jalal Talabani, leader of one
of the main Kurdish resistance groups. "There are no schools
or mosques, and no one can leave without permission."
   From the highway, all that can be seen of the new towns is
a strip of fresh tar road leading to compact groups of
concrete-block buildings. Asking a driver to approach for a
closer look elicits a nervous refusal. "Afterwards, they
would interrogate me about who you were and why I took you
there," the driver says.
   In a 1977 speech, Mr. Hussein warned Iraqis to "beware of
the foreigner, for the latter is a pair of eyes and ears for
his country, and some of them are saboteurs of the
revolution. Therefore, accompanying foreigners or talking
with them in the absence of known controls is forbidden."
Iraqis still stick strictly to that prohibition. "I pushed a
baby carriage around the streets of Iraq for two years," says
a diplomat's wife. "Not once, ever, did anyone smile at my
baby or say so much as kootchy-kootchy-koo."
   Foreign journalists are particularly suspect. In March,
Iraq executed a British-based reporter, Farzad Bazoft, saying
his attempt to investigate an explosion at a military
facility was espionage. Two weeks ago, Iraq seized all the
film of a British Broadcasting Corp. crew, even though it had
come on government invitation and filmed under constant
supervision.
   Western publications aren't available, and the government
makes no bones about its total control of the press. On May
5, the Baghdad Observer quoted Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
saying Mr. Hussein had "ordered that Iraqi media should halt
its anti-Syrian drive as a measure necessitated by the
summit." The usual abusive references to the Syrian
president, Hafez Assad, promptly vanished.
   So far, U.S. policy seems to put more weight on Iraq's oil
wealth than on a human rights record the State Department
terms "abysmal." The U.S. has urged Iraq and other Arab
states to moderate their rhetoric at next week's summit --
Iraq has published what it says is the text of such a U.S.
message. However, in January President Bush overrode a
congressional ban on Ex-Im Bank credit guarantees to Iraq.
   "We might want to be holier-than-thou, but this isn't a
country you can tell to go sit in a corner," says a U.S.
official. "The potential for tremendous conflict is here, and
we need to be talking."
   A Western businessman who knows the Iraqi president says
sanctions might only increase his excesses. "You can't
out-tough Saddam because he can always be more ruthless," he
says. "The only hope to moderate his position is to engage
him in a dialogue and expose him to Western thinking." But
the businessman laments that such a dialogue isn't easy:
"Everything you try to tell him, he says, `I know.'"
   To most Westerners, Mr. Hussein remains enigmatic. He
doesn't travel outside the Arab world, and longstanding
interview requests remain unanswered. The Iraqi president
grew up in poverty and political turmoil. Newly independent
Iraq was wracked by bloody coups. Iraqi King Faisal, just
before his death in 1933, wrote despairingly of his realm:
"There is still -- and I say this with a heart full of sorrow
-- no Iraqi people but unimaginable masses of human beings,
devoid of any patriotic idea . . ., prone to anarchy, and
perpetually ready to rise against any government whatever."
   Mr. Hussein was reared mainly by an uncle, Khairallah
Tulfah, who later became his father-in-law. A hint of his
childhood milieu can be gleaned from a leaflet authored by
Mr. Tulfah, entitled: "Three Whom God Should Not Have
Created: Persians, Jews and Flies." Persians, says the
pamphlet, are "criminals God created in the shape of humans,"
while Jews are a "mixture of the dirt and leftovers of
diverse peoples."
   Many Iraqis seem reluctant to talk about the president,
even to praise him. "We have many books and articles
explaining his personality, so what can I add?" asks Abdul
Latif Taha, governor of Tikrit, the president's home town. At
a museum, one exhibit features the president's school report
card. Asked which were his best and worst subjects, a guide
replies: "All are good." She refuses to translate the marks
for each subject.
   Yet the museum does provide some insights into Mr.
Hussein's early life and later rule. Swept up by the violent
politics of his times, he took part at age 22 in an attempt
to assassinate the prime minister, Abdul Karim Qassem. It
failed and, during the assassins' escape, Mr. Hussein pulled
his gun on his own gang to prevent their taking a badly
wounded comrade to a hospital. Shot in the leg himself, he
nevertheless managed to flee the country by motorbike
disguised in Bedouin robes.
   From the coffee shops of Cairo he continued to plot,
shocking some Egyptian acquaintances by his ruthless talk of
shooting all opponents. One museum exhibit shows the old
Optima typewriter on which he composed seditious leaflets. As
president, he has kept such dangerous machines under tight
control, requiring until recently that every typewriter be
licensed.
   Since the 1988 cease-fire with Iran, Mr. Hussein has said
he wants to liberalize Iraq, even talking of alternative
political parties. "Half of me is still with the opposition,"
he told a group of Arab lawyers in February. So far, reforms
have been limited. Travel abroad now is permitted, and
weather reports appear in the press (during the war, even the
previous day's temperature was a state secret). Military
checkpoints are fewer and less tense. And communications are
easing -- somewhat.
   "They told us we could import a certain brand of fax
machine," says a diplomat in Baghdad. "When we brought in a
different brand with the same specifications they told us it
wasn't acceptable. Probably they only know how to bug one
brand."
   Perhaps the most intriguing change is a decline in the
number of the huge portraits of the president that deck the
streets. Two years ago, it wasn't uncommon to see his
mustachioed visage beaming from all four corners of an
intersection. These days, the density has declined to a
portrait every few blocks. But hard information on even this
slight trend proves scarce.
   "We have many pictures of the president. We love the
president," replies an anxious Ministry of Information guide,
when asked about a portrait non-proliferation policy. A
senior government official also demurs. "I wouldn't know," he
says, gazing out the window of his downtown office. "I don't
go into the city much."
