   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said it put up for sale
most of its Donnelley Marketing division, continuing its
policy of shedding nonstrategic businesses.
   Donnelley Marketing is a leading direct-mail distributor
of cents-off coupons and consumer merchandise, and also
provides mailing lists and mailing services. D&amp;B said the
only other segment of Donnelley Marketing -- Donnelley
Marketing Information Services, which markets demographic
information -- isn't for sale.

   Without the information-services segment, D&amp;B said,
Donnelley Marketing had 1989 revenue of about $225 million,
or 5.2% of D&amp;B's total revenue. The financial-information
services giant said Donnelley Marketing is profitable, but
wouldn't give any further details.
   D&amp;B also refused to disclose the price it expects to get
for most of Donnelley Marketing, but one analyst said it will
likely fetch in excess of $200 million. Industry insiders
speculated that the price could go as high as $400 million or
$500 million.
   The sale decision fits into D&amp;B's recent policy of selling
businesses that don't fit into its overall strategy. In
recent months, D&amp;B has announced plans to sell five such
units: Datastream International, Interactive Data, Neodata
Services, Petroleum Information and Zytron. D&amp;B has retained
investment bank Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to facilitate the sales.
   D&amp;B is focusing on information services for three areas:
risk management, marketing, and yellow-pages directories; and
on software for business applications.
   Joseph Laird, an analyst who follows D&amp;B for Veronis,
Suhler &amp; Associates Inc., said the sale made sense. "The part
that they're shedding is emphatically not an information
business, while the part that they're keeping is," he said.
"It's a perfectly understandable decision."
