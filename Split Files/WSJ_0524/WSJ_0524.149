   WASHINGTON -- Taxes may be the easy part. Just wait until
the budget summit turns to cutting spending.
   If negotiators are serious about slashing the deficit by
$50 billion and eschewing gimmickry, budget experts say
they'll have to cut between $10 billion and $15 billion from
projected spending on the Big Four entitlement programs:
Social Security, Medicare, farm spending and federal-employee
benefits.

   "You've got to go there because that's where the money
is," says David Mathiasen, a former White House budget
official who is now at the General Accounting Office.
   It's also where the politics of reducing the deficit gets
treacherous. The senior-citizen lobby, farm organizations and
government unions all have proven their ability to repel
attacks. "The broader and more equitable a deficit-reduction
strategy, the more opposition," Mr. Mathiasen says. "Every
strategy gets pulled apart into individual pieces, the
interest groups beat the heck out of you and all the
politicians run for cover."
   Summiteers naturally will look elsewhere, too. But most
budget analysts figure that an honest $50 billion
deficit-reduction package will get no more than $25 billion
in taxes, perhaps $10 billion to $15 billion from the
Pentagon and, therefore, $10 billion to $15 billion from
everything else.
   Much of that "everything else" isn't likely to contribute
significantly. Neither Congress nor the White House shows any
appetite for cutbacks in spending on the poor or on veterans.
And the summit is unlikely to pare much from the $200 billion
pot that Congress appropriates annually for everything from
the space program to the war on drugs, a category that
includes everything that Congress and President Bush want to
increase. Whatever cuts negotiators find in this category are
likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.
   And that brings the focus back to the Big Four. They stand
out because they would largely escape the pain of
across-the-board budget cuts if the summit fails. By law, the
government must pay all eligible comers, no matter how
strained federal finances. There's no annual vote by Congress
to spend the money and, therefore, no bill for a president to
attack with the line-item veto that the administration talks
about so avidly.
   Some long-time budget watchers think this may be the year
that these popular programs feel the knife. "Once you start
talk about raising taxes, you're going to see an appetite for
spending restraint like you've never seen," predicts Carol
Cox, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget, a coalition of former members of Congress and
business executives.
   Here's a closer look at the Big Four: Social Security
benefits represent more than 20 cents of every dollar the
government spends. Cutbacks in Social Security have figured
for years in backroom talk about "the big deal" to reduce the
deficit. But recent debate over payroll taxes and the growing
trust fund surplus make politicians of all stripes more wary
than ever about touching benefits. "Social Security this year
will take in $70 billion more than it pays out," says Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.).
   One big money-saver would be suspending cost-of-living
adjustments for one year. This would shrink the deficit by
nearly $8 billion in the first year, the Congressional Budget
Office says. But it would hurt poor senior citizens as well
as rich ones. Few insiders expect the summit to embrace this
option -- unless there's a pact to freeze inflation
adjustments to all government spending programs and to
income-tax brackets as well.
   A more likely option is increasing federal income taxes on
Social Security benefits paid to the well-off elderly. Today,
50% of the benefits paid to couples earning more than $32,000
(and individuals earning more than $25,000) are taxed.
Subjecting 85% of the benefits to taxes would bring in $1
billion the first fiscal year and $4 billion the next. This
may prove attractive to Democrats seeking something to
balance against regressive tax increases, but some in
Congress are fearful of stirring up the elderly who
campaigned so successfully to repeal the surtax imposed last
year to pay for expanded Medicare benefits. Medicare is a
target not only because it costs so much -- about $100
billion a year -- but because it's growing frighteningly
fast. Without changes, the White House budget office says,
Medicare spending will exceed spending on Social Security
retirees and defense early in the next decade.
   Budget analysts increasingly are coming to the conclusion
that attempts to restrain Medicare's growth by tinkering with
the rules will fail without broader changes in America's
health-care system. But the budget summit isn't about to
tackle that immense problem. "What we'll end up doing is more
belt-tightening until we have a better sense of the options,"
says Ms. Cox.
   Mr. Bush proposes squeezing hospitals and doctors to save
$5.5 billion next year. Heavily lobbied by local hospitals
and fearful that the quality of health care for the elderly
will suffer, Congress shows no sign of going along with that
plan -- even though under the plan, total Medicare spending
still would rise by almost 7%. Budgets passed by the House
and by the Senate Budget Committee would save much less than
half the $5.5 billion in cuts Mr. Bush proposes. Budget
committee chairmen say they doubt Congress will agree to pare
much more than $2 billion.
   Farm subsidies are particularly vulnerable this year, both
because the farm economy is strong and because congressional
critics of farm subsidies already are geared up for a fight
over a pending farm bill. Unlike Medicare, farm-subsidy
formulas could easily be restructured to cost less. "Tell
those folks (on the agricultural committees) how much they
have to spend and they can design a farm program for that
amount of money," Ms. Cox says.
   But there's only so much the summit will get out of a
program that currently costs $12 billion a year, though
administration officials warn that a year or two of bumper
crops could drive the cost far higher. The political
difficulty of squeezing out even the $1.5 billion that Mr.
Bush proposed was underscored when Sen. Sasser exempted farm
subsidies from his deficit-reduction plan to garner committee
votes.
   Federal-employee benefits also are a perennial target of
the White House budget office because so much money is
involved -- more than $50 billion in pensions and about $7
billion in health-care costs for active and retired workers.
   Skipping inflation adjustment on pensions for one year, as
Mr. Bush proposes, would save the government $1.5 billion.
But Congress is likely to reject this as long as Social
Security recipients get their inflation increase. An option
that's slightly more palatable politically: Eliminate annual
cost-of-living adjustments only for early retirees and
promise them a catchup raise at age 62. The Congressional
Budget Office figures this would save only $500 million the
first year, but $9.3 billion over five years.
