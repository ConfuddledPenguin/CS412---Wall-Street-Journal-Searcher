   MONTREAL -- Seagram Co. raised its quarterly dividend 43%
to 50 U.S. cents a share from 35 cents, a bigger increase
than analysts expected.
   "I think the size of the boost might be considered
surprising," said Michael Palmer, an analyst with McCarthy
Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Mr. Palmer said Seagram had been
telling analysts the company is in good financial shape and
to expect a dividend increase. The dividend is payable June
15 to stock of record June 4.

   Seagram said operating profit in its first quarter ended
April 30 was significantly better than the year-earlier
US$125.4 million. Operating profit doesn't include dividends
received from Du Pont Co. and equity in Du Pont's unremitted
earnings. Seagram owns 24.2% of Du Pont, a Wilmington, Del.,
chemical and energy concern. Seagram said its first-quarter
earnings will be reported shortly.
   Speaking after the annual meeting here, Edgar Bronfman,
chairman and chief executive officer, declined to comment on
analysts' mean earnings estimate for the year ending Jan. 31
of US$8.50 a share. In fiscal 1990, Seagram earned US$710.6
million, or US$7.37 a share. But Mr. Bronfman said earnings
from Seagram's spirits and beverages business will be "quite
a bit better," compared with a year earlier.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Seagram shares jumped $2 to close at $86.50.
