   Costco Wholesale Corp. said in Kirkland, Wash., that it
expects to take a $3.7 million charge in the third quarter
ended May 13 because it plans to close four of its warehouse
stores in Florida.
   Costco said that three of the stores have been
unprofitable and that a fourth was being closed in
conjunction with the opening of a new facility. It said it
will continue operating at nine locations in Florida.

   In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $4.6 million,
or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $645.9 million. The
cash-and-carry membership warehouse operator, which said it
expects to finish the fiscal year with 62 stores, plans to
add 10 to 12 locations next year.
