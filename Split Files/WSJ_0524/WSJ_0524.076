   Leveraged Buy-Out Funds Are High-Fliers No Longer

   NEW YORK -- Amid a deep slump in the leveraged buy-out
business, the once-astronomical investment returns of LBO
funds are coming back to earth.
   First, more LBOs are running into financial trouble.
Second, when LBO funds try to cash out by selling companies,
they often can't get top prices.

   Finally, with the volume of buy-outs down 86% this year,
LBO funds have been left with huge pools of capital that
remain uninvested. To put these unused billions to work, and
meet new stringent standards set by bank lenders, LBO fund
managers are doing deals with a lot less leverage and more
equity.
   As a result, some of the funds that once boasted annual
returns of 50% to 100% now say they are shooting for only 18%
to 40% annually. "The returns should be lower because the
deals require more equity; it's simple arithmetic," says
Stephen Schwartzman, president of Blackstone Group, which has
an $850 million buy-out fund.
   Last week, in a deal that exemplifies the new,
less-leveraged buy-outs, the $1.5 billion LBO fund run by
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. paid $100 million to buy Londontown
Holdings Corp., maker of London Fog raincoats.
   Instead of selling high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds or
seeking new bank debt, the Merrill fund simply assumed
Londontown's existing debts of $180 million. That gave the
deal a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2-to-1, instead of
the 10-to-1 debt-equity ratio that used to jet-propel the
returns of LBOs in the 1980s.
   Here's why putting more equity into buy-outs can drag down
investment returns:
   A fund buys a company for $100 and sells it a year later
for $110. If it puts down $10 in equity and borrows $90 for
the purchase, it clears $20 on the sale after repaying debt
-- a $10 profit, or a 100% return. But if the fund puts down
$40 and borrows only $60, the same $10 profit amounts to only
25%.
   James J. Burke Jr., president of Merrill Lynch Capital
Partners, Merrill's buy-out fund, says, "The financing
environment at the moment is as bad as I've seen it in 10
years. The market for bank debt is in a complete state of
disarray." Similarly troubled is the market for junk bonds,
which financed most of the big LBOs in recent years.
   Although the Merrill fund continues to pursue deals and
has completed nine buy-outs in the past 18 months, Mr. Burke
says Merrill has lowered its return target from 40% annually
to as little as 30%.
   Although the Merrill fund continues to pursue deals and
has completed nine buy-outs in the past 18 months, Mr. Burke
says Merrill has lowered its return target from 40% annually
to as little as 30%, reflecting some of the buy-outs' more
conservative financial structure.
   Executives of the largest buy-out group, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., declined to be interviewed. KKR touted annual
returns of 60% back in 1987 when the firm was seeking
investors for a giant $5.6 billion fund. More recently, KKR
has suffered some high-profile financial setbacks with a few
of its buy-outs, among them Seaman Furniture and Jim Walter
Co.
   Now, a spokesman for the firm says, KKR's investment
target is a mere 18% to 25% annually. "The standard quote is
that they expect to make three to four times their money in
six to seven years," the spokesman said. "That's been their
pitch since the Stone Age." And one KKR investor notes that
the Seaman and Jim Walter investments amount to less than 5%
of the KKR fund.
   Although 18% a year is still enough to outperform the
stock market's long-term average 10% annual return, it's a
far cry from 60%, particularly since buy-out investments are
long-term, illiquid, and expensive. And the pension funds and
other big institutions that invest in LBO funds still must
pay annual fees averaging 1.5% of their commitments, even if
the money is uninvested. That's more than double what the
average stock manager charges.
   One reason that the returns of LBO funds are falling is
that it's taking longer for them to resell at a profit
companies they earlier bought. And the longer that takes, the
lower the funds' annual returns will be.
   For example, Merrill's first LBO fund, a smaller pool with
$400 million, still owns nine of the 20 companies it
purchased between 1985 and 1988. At the end of 1988, the
fund's annual rate of return was 58%. By the end of 1989,
that annual rate had declined to 50%.
   The bleak buy-out environment has driven some players to
the sidelines. Gibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd., which
raised a $425 million fund in 1987, suffered financial
reverses in two buy-outs in the past year, Sheller-Globe
Corp. and Ohio Mattress Corp. Its partners split up last
year, and the firm doesn't have any plans for new investments
or raising new money, according to a spokesman.
   Some buy-out executives argue that the reduced level of
activity and competition for deals will boost potential
returns for those who remain on the field. "Returns are
largely a function of purchase price," says Joseph L. Rice,
president of the buy-out firm of Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc.
Prices for new LBOs should be lower, he says, because "a
tremendous number of marginal players have been pushed to the
sidelines."
   Mr. Rice adds, "We're in the business of trying to achieve
50% compounded on the funds that we're investing." That
target hasn't changed, he says. Buy-out financing will merely
revert to "the market that existed before 1983," when Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. popularized using junk bonds for
buy-outs.
   Instead of new junk-bond issues, buy-out funds will revert
to obtaining subordinated debt financing from insurance
companies and other big investors in the private-placement
market, Mr. Rice said. But that will limit the size of deals,
because the private market isn't as deep or as easy to tap as
the public junk market.
   Another buy-out firm that expects to prosper in the
current tougher environment is Forstmann Little &amp; Co. That's
because Forstmann has always shunned the use of junk bonds,
relying instead for financing on its own $1.6 billion
subordinated debt fund, as well as a $800 million buy-out
equity fund. That capability enabled Forstmann to do one of
the largest buy-outs this year, purchasing the Gulfstream
Aerospace jet-plane maker from Chrysler Corp. for $825
million.
