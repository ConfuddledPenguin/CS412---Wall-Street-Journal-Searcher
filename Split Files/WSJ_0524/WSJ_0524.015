   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. said it settled
its suit against Daimler-Benz AG that had charged the West
German company with breaking its agreement to jointly develop
a new generation of jet engines.
   Under the settlement, GE said it will get additional
revenue from their existing long-term programs with
Daimler-Benz on engines that generate 50,000 to 75,000 pounds
of thrust. These engines are used in Boeing 747, the Airbus
A310 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.

   GE, however, agreed to end its agreement with Daimler on
developing the next generation of engines with 85,000 to
95,000 pounds of thrust, the so-called GE90 engines.
   GE sued Daimler-Benz last April when, it alleged, the
German concern's Motorenund Turbinen-Union unit, known as
MTU, broke the agreement with GE and entered into "a
memorandum of understanding" with United Technologies Corp.
to pursue a wide range of commercial engine programs.
   As part of the settlement, MTU will destroy all
proprietary information it has on the GE90 engine. MTU will
be free to proceed with its agreement with United
Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney unit to develop the PW4000
engine, which will compete with GE90.
   GE declined to say how much additional revenue it will
receive as a result of the renegotiated terms on existing
long-term contracts with MTU. But an official familiar with
the settlement estimated the amount to be "several hundred
million dollars" over 10 to 15 years.
   Daimler-Benz couldn't be reached for comment.
