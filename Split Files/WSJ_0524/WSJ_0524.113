   Wearne Brothers Ltd., a Singapore-based multinational,
said it plans to acquire all shares outstanding of Qume
Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer-peripherals
company.
   Wearne said an offer for the Qume shares at $7.25 a share
has been made by New Qume Corp., a company started by a
recently formed partnership between Wearne, Qume's chairman
and chief executive, David Lee, and other unnamed investors.

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Qume
shares closed at $6.625, unchanged.
   As the proposed acquisition is subject to the partners
obtaining sufficient financing, Wearne Brothers will provide
a $70 million loan to the partnership.
   In a separate announcement, Wearne Brothers said group
pretax profit rose 45% to 28.4 million Singapore dollars
($15.3 million) for the financial half year ended March 31,
compared with S$19.6 million for the year-earlier period.
