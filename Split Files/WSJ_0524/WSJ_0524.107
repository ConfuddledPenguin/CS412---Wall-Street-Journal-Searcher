   LONDON -- Midland Bank PLC is leading commercial-bank
talks with the Brazilian government to establish a $1.5
billion fund of bank claims that can be swapped into equity
in state-owned companies Brazil intends to transfer to
private hands.
   A spokesman for Midland -- its $2 billion in loans
outstanding to Brazil makes it the country's biggest British
banking creditor -- said the company has had "preliminary
discussions" with Brazilian officials about the fund. The
bank hopes to reach a preliminary accord in the next few
months, prior to a September launch. Chase Manhattan Corp.,
New York, and Bank of Tokyo are among the banks considering
joining the fund as sponsors, Midland said.

   The discussions come as Brazil, pursuing its bold
anti-inflation program, prepares to resume negotiations on
its $115 billion foreign debt and mount its drive to sell
state companies. Brazil hasn't paid interest on its $65
billion of medium-term and long-term bank debt since
September.
