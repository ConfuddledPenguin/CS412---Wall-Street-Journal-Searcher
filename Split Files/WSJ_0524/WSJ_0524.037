   Ronald Reagan, in a commencement address Friday at
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge:

   Let me tell you the basis of my optimism for our future.
What has made the United States great is that ours has been
an empire of ideals. The ideals of freedom, democracy, and a
belief in the remarkable potential of the individual. Power
isn't simply wealth or troops. Power is also spirit and
ideas. And these we have in abundance.
   The attitude of wanting to be the biggest and to go the
farthest and to get there first and to do the most good when
we arrived is part of our national character. Americans have
always been larger than life. We wanted to establish the best
government on Earth. We wanted to put a man on the moon. This
is the spirit we set loose. This is the passion that invented
revolutionary technologies and a culture young people
everywhere envy.
   And this is the attitude that has defeated communism. At
some dark, lonely moment during the last decade, a terrible
realization set in upon the leaders of the Soviet Union. They
realized that their system could not take them where the
United States and the rest of the free world was going.
   The West's economics and technologies were a powerful
booster blasting us into orbits the communist world could not
hope to reach. Our communications technology sailed over the
barbed wire and concrete walls, letting their citizens know
what democracy could offer, what free markets could provide.
Our computer technology left them bewildered and behind,
paper societies in an electronic age.
   I believe President Gorbachev realized the United States
and West were turbocharged for the future and pulling farther
and farther away. He could not slow down the rest of the
world; his only hope was to speed up change within the Soviet
Union.
   Gorbachev is grappling with historic and bitter ethnic
tensions where seething memories, not reason, prevail. He's
overwhelmed by an economy so defeated that food rots at the
sides of the fields because there's no transportation to
market. He faces a bureaucracy that for 70 years has
smothered every spark of innovation or initiative. I
genuinely hope my friend succeeds against the problems
arrayed against him.
   What must we do in these times of change and uncertainty?
We must simply do what we've always done -- remain true to
our ideals. And those are the ideals of freedom and
democracy.
   I wholeheartedly encourage the hopes of the Baltic peoples
who wish to be free to run their own countries. I celebrate
their bravery. The captive nations of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia were invaded by the Soviet Union. They have been held
against their will since 1940 when Hitler and Stalin made a
pact. Ladies and Gentlemen, no pact made by Hitler and Stalin
should prevail today. The Baltic countries and their peoples
should be free]
   Communist dominoes are falling all over the world. We must
continue to give communist dominoes a good push whenever and
wherever we can. There are still those that must fall-China,
North Korea, North Vietnam, North Yemen, and, of course,
Cuba. Cuba is next in democracy's sweep. And let me say
directly to Fidel Castro -- like Honecker in East Germany,
like Ceausescu in Romania, like Noriega in Panama, like all
the other has-been dictators of despair, you cannot fight
democracy's destiny. Fidel, you're finished]
   . . . We should not be timid in our embrace of democracy.
We should be as bold and brash in our democratic ideals as
ever in our history. The Golden Age of Freedom is near
because America has remained true to her ideals. This is not
the time to let our support for democracy wane.
