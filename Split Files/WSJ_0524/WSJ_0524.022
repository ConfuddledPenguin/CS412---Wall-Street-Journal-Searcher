   DOWN ON THE FARM, things -- finally -- return to normal.
   Farmers are still cautious, says Ken Bird of First
National Bank of Kiester, Minn. "But they're finally taking
out loans to buy implements and fix up." Farm debt, which has
dropped by a third since the mid-'80s, is expected to edge up
this year, economists say. Profitability is back to a
4%-to-5% return on assets from 1% or less a decade ago. The
price of land, farmers' biggest asset, is rising for the
fourth straight year.

   Some 31% of Midwesterners say they are better off than a
year ago; only 17% are worse off, says a University of Iowa
Heartland Poll. Corn and winter-wheat growers are twice
blessed: adequate spring rain and exports to keep prices
strong. One result: Federal payments to Indiana farmers are
expected to make up less than 40% of net farm income,
compared with 74% in 1987.
   A six-year-old crisis line for Missouri farmers was
disconnected a month ago because it got so few calls.
                                                                                                       

   PACKER BASHERS turn up the heat on meat mergers.
   Rural activists upset over the growing concentration of
meatpackers are finding support among groups such as the
American Farm Bureau Federation. Five state attorneys general
want Uncle Sam to look for antitrust violations by the top
beef companies: IBP, ConAgra and Cargill. The three slaughter
some 70% of U.S. beef.
   Fierce competition that keeps profits at less than 1% of
sales has kept the Justice Department from stepping in. But
anti-concentration sentiment is spreading due to a rebound in
herd size that may let meatpackers bid down farm prices.
Also, big meatpackers are fattening more of their own cattle
and expanding into the hog business. Still, Cargill says
government studies haven't found that concentration hurts
prices. "It's never been more competitive," a spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   MOSCOW LOOKS WEST for technology to fix its ailing food
system.
   Western analysts say a third of some Soviet crops spoil
before they're used. Now the Soviets are starting to import
U.S. technology for everything from canning vegetables to
cleaning raisins. To cut meat transport time, the U.S.S.R. is
breaking up its slaughterhouses into hundreds of local
meatpacking plants, says Jim Masterson of Koch Supplies Inc.,
Kansas City, Mo. His company is negotiating to design a
showcase plant near Moscow. Seed &amp; Grain Systems Inc., New
Virginia, Iowa, has an $8.1 million contract to oversee
construction of a facility to treat and bag seed corn.
   Political uncertainty and difficulty in getting currency
out of the Soviet Union makes U.S. companies cautious about
joint ventures. But Soviet business is seen as a possible
boon by agriculture-related companies, such as grain-bin
makers, that have fallen on hard times. "We need to follow
the business where it goes," says John Kerr of Chief
Industries Inc., Grand Island, Neb., which is negotiating a
$2.5 million deal with the Soviets to design a grain-drying
facility.
   The Soviet Union's agricultural science academy and Iowa
State University agreed this week to open sister commercial
offices.
                                                                                                       

   IRRADIATED CHICKEN isn't headed to market, despite a Food
and Drug Administration clearance. The X-ray treatment could
reduce salmonella in processing plants, but consumers "still
equate it with nuclear power plants," says Stephen Pretanik
of the National Broiler Council.
                                                                                                       

   BY ANY OTHER NAME? The Fertilizer Institute, which
represents commercial makers, says the name manure has "a
natural connotation" that is misleading. It prefers "fecal
contamination," saying the stuff "isn't a warm fuzzy
substance."
                                                                                                       

   FARMS DON'T COMPUTE as much as expected, says an
Agriculture Department survey. Only 3% of U.S. farmers use
computers for financial record-keeping. The most common spot
for computerized farms: the West Coast.
                                                                                                       

   OPTIONS RESURFACE as a possible way to replace government
payments.
   A 1988 experiment by the Agriculture Department flopped:
Only a handful of 5,000 farmers attending classes signed up
to buy options on futures contracts with a government safety
net, thus hedging the price their crops would bring. Now the
Chicago Board of Trade is pushing a second experiment. "The
idea of getting farmers to use private-sector financial
instruments instead of public support is a good one," says
Bruce Gardner, the top USDA economist.
   The problem: Options to buy futures contracts are so
complex that even some savvy food companies spurn them. Some
surveys show only about 10% of farmers have ever used a
futures contract, partly due to the suspicion that traders
manipulate grain prices. "I've had a long distrust of those
markets," says Alan Bergman, president of the North Dakota
Farmers Union.
   Soviets are very interested in futures trading, with Refco
running several officials through its training course.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Hamilton Meat Co., San Diego, installs a rib-eye
steak vending machine in Japan. . . . A favorite pastime of
42% of farmers surveyed by Farm Futures magazine: church.
