   DETROIT -- The U.S. auto market remained depressed in
mid-May with sales of domestically built cars and trucks
tumbling 17.7% from year-earlier levels.
   Manufacturers are bracing for some more tough numbers
before sales bounce back. "The market is terrible," said Ford
Motor Co. President Philip E. Benton Jr. He predicted that
there won't be any improvement for "the rest of this model
year, but we do look for improvement as early as the fourth
quarter."

   While the U.S. Big Three were hurting, with combined
domestic car and truck sales off 21.9%, Japanese car makers
continued to make inroads on the market.
   Toyota Motor Corp., which has been increasing production
at its Kentucky plant, posted a 117% increase in sales of its
U.S.built vehicles in the May 11-20 period. Nissan Motor
Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. each posted jumps of more than
40%.
   Overall, consumers bought 259,110 North American-built
vehicles, a 17.7% decrease from a year ago based on the daily
selling pace. There were eight selling days in mid-May,
compared with nine a year ago.
   Sales of domestically made cars fell 19.3%, pulling the
seasonally adjusted annual selling pace down to a sickly 6.0
million cars from 6.4 million in early May and 7.2 million a
year ago.
   Sales of domestically made trucks, which had fared better
than cars in recent months, fell 15%.
   Car dealers attributed the slump partly to a slowdown in
the number of customers coming into their showrooms. In
addition, many prospective buyers are unable to qualify for
financing because they still owe too much money on their
current car loan, dealers said.
   "The five-year financing is finally catching up to us,"
said George Portilla, general sales manager for Sam White
Oldsmobile in Houston. "We got a lot of people that come in
wanting to trade cars, but they owe more on the car than it's
worth."
   Ford's total sales fell 23.1% during mid-May, to 78,773
vehicles. Sales of domestic trucks dropped 12%, with compact
sports utility vehicles providing one of the few bright spots
for the No. 2 auto maker. The new Ford Explorer and
not-so-new Bronco II, which Explorer ultimately will replace,
racked up combined 10-day sales of 4,258, an almost 60% rise
from a year ago.
   Domestic car sales skidded 29.9%, however, as deliveries
of Ford's Escort subcompact car continued to lag year-earlier
levels, despite the recent introduction of a completely new
1991 version.
   Dealers said the price of the new Escort is partly to
blame. The 1991 Escort hasn't any consumer rebate, and many
buyers are deciding instead to purchase 1990 Escorts, which
carry a lower base price and a $1,000 rebate.
   "I think the {1991 Escort} is a fine automobile," said
Mark Brobeck, general manager of Ricart Ford in Columbus,
Ohio. "But I think it's going to take some money on the table
to get people to buy it."
   General Motors Corp. sold 116,185 vehicles, down 20.9%
from a year ago. Domestic car sales dropped 23.7% while
domestic truck sales were down 16.7% Chrysler Corp., which
has been hurting since February, posted a 24% drop in total
vehicles. Sales of domestic cars fell 22.1% while sales of
domestic trucks, including minivans, fell 21%. Chrysler
recently adopted a $500 dealer incentive on its longer
wheel-base minivans, to help boost sales.
   Despite the overall decline,, Chrysler executives say
they're encouraged that their share of the U.S. vehicle
market is improving from the dismal levels of earlier this
year. Final figures won't be available until the end of the
month but vice chairman Gerald Greenwald says Chrysler's
estimates indicate "we really hit bottom in April and we're
starting back up." Last month Chrysler's share of the U.S.
car market fell to 7.8%, compared with 10.9% a year ago.
   Honda Motor Co. racked up a 22.4% increase in domestic
cars, partly as a result of a new dealer incentive program it
quietly began last month.
