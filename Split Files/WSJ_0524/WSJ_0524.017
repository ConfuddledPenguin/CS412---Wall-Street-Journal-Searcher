   Tonight, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Sisters." This drama
about sibling rivalry in Manhattan may bring Woody Allen's
films to mind. But really, it's more like "thirtysomething."

   Friday, May 25, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "The Stations of Bach."
   This lushly scenic tour through the German cities that
were home to Bach includes fine performances by German
ensembles, and the deft musical insights of the host,
violinist James Buswell.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, May 27, 8-9:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "National
Memorial Day Concert."
   Never before televised, this live concert from the Capitol
in Washington, D.C., will honor America's war dead and
veterans with patriotic standards and non-standards. Among
the performers are Rosemary Clooney and the U.S. Army Fife
and Drum Corps.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, May 27, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E (repeated at
midnight and June 2): "Tumbledown." For those who take a
gloomier view of Memorial Day, this BBC film dramatizes the
story of Robert Lawrence, a Scots Guard lieutenant who was
physically disabled by wounds suffered during the Falklands
War, then emotionally devastated by the treatment he received
back in Britain.
                                                                                                       

   Mondays, May 28-June 11, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Stalin."
   Was he a lunatic who derailed a noble revolution, or was
he the inevitable product of totalitarian ideology? This
series, co-produced by WGBH Boston and Thames Television,
gives no conclusive answer. But it does offer a frightening
portrait of the tyrant described in an early police report as
"active and serious . . . extremely conspiratorial."
                                                                                                       

   Beginning Thursday, May 31, on various outlets: Coverage
of the summit meeting between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev.
                                                                                                       

   Friday, June 1, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Cinderella."
   The music is still by Prokofiev, but the strange sounds,
bizarre settings and weird choreography are by the French
choreographer Maguy Marin. This intriguing production from
the Lyon Opera Ballet is presented by "Alive From Off
Center."
                                                                                                       

   Saturday, June 2, 9 p.m. -- midnight EDT, on various
stations (check local listings): "Earth '90."
   This international broadcast will resemble the famous
"Live Aid" show of 1985, but it isn't a fund raiser. Instead,
entertainers in Japan, the U.S., Brazil and the U.S.S.R. will
simply make a joyful noise unto the environment. John Denver
and Olivia Newton-John co-host.
                                                                                                       

   Sundays, June 3-24, 5 p.m. EDT (program lengths vary), on
Bravo: Maurice Sendak operas on "Culture for Kids."
   This unusual series begins with two musical pieces by
Ravel, staged by the acclaimed children's author. Then it
continues with stagings of a Mother Goose tale and, finally,
Mr. Sendak's own classic, "Where the Wild Things Are."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, June 3, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The 44th Annual
Tony Awards."
   Kathleen Turner, currently appearing on Broadway as the
cat in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," will
emcee this year's Broadway-theater awards ceremony, broadcast
live from the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, June 4, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on TNT (repeated at 11 p.m.
and June 9): "Myrna Loy: So Nice to Come Home to."
   As it happens, Ms. Turner also is hosting this film
tribute to the witty and sexy Hollywood superstar. The
script, written by the film critic Richard Schickel, is a cut
above the usual.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, June 4, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "USSR Art."
   Talk about culture shock. This film traces the changes
occurring in the Soviet underground art scene, now that it
has been opened up to the Western art market. As described by
Viktor Misiano, the former curator of the Pushkin Museum: "If
you go to studios where the conversation used to be all about
God, light, the universe, about moral and ethical problems,
now the conversation is about one thing -- money."
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, June 5, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Living the Last
Days."
   In an effort to reduce costs and bring comfort to those
dying of AIDS, Los Angeles's Brownlie Hospice opened in 1988.
This film portrays the daily atmosphere in that remarkable
facility.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, June 6, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "The Quantum
Universe."
   It's so simple, even an 11-year-old child can explain it.
Or such is the premise of this Smithsonian World special, in
which 20th-century physics is taught through narration (by an
11-year-old), acting, music and graphics.
