   Mitchell Rubenstein must be wondering whether he's trapped
in a science-fiction movie, fighting forces beyond his
control.
   Just as the 36-year-old Florida lawyer embarked on the
ambitious start-up of a national cable network called the
Sci-Fi Channel, an intergalactic battle broke out over
regulation of the cable industry, threatening his well-laid
plans.

   To generate enough ad revenue to have a chance of
surviving, Mr. Rubenstein must sign up cable systems reaching
five million to seven million subscribers, or about 10% of
the cable universe, by the time the 24-hour channel begins
operating Dec. 31.
   That means persuading cable operators to give him a space
in already-crowded lineups. At the National Cable Television
Association trade show in Atlanta this week, he was competing
not only with dozens of established basic cable networks and
some recent start-ups that have major corporate backing, but
also with a host of other entrepreneurial newcomers, from the
Cowboy Channel to Celticvision, an Irish-American channel.
   But even those who like Mr. Rubenstein's concept have
other things on their minds. "I'd love to put the Sci-Fi
Channel on," says Marc Nathanson, chairman of Falcon Cable
Systems Co., based in Los Angeles, which reaches 800,000
subscribers. "My attitude is, put everything on -- a
science-fiction channel, a cowboy channel, an all-cartoon
channel.
   "But I'm very reluctant to add a preponderance of new
channels until I see what happens to rate regulation. What's
the incentive {to increase channel capacity} if rates are
going to be capped?"
   That attitude is common. Cable operators feel threatened
by the debate in Washington over reregulating the industry.
Reregulation has been discussed for some time, but when a key
bill was introduced in Congress last November, action
suddenly began to look more likely. That was bad timing for
Mr. Rubenstein, president of the Sci-Fi Channel, who was
about to start pitching the channel to cable operators.
Though the likelihood of tough new regulations appears to
have eased in recent weeks, many cable operators aren't
inclined to commit themselves to the capital investment
necessary to expand channel capacity until the issue is
resolved.
   But Mr. Rubenstein is undaunted. So far the Sci-Fi
Channel, based in Boca Raton, Fla., has signed up systems
serving about 1.5 million subscribers, mostly "ma and pa"
operations with fewer than 100,000 households each, and Mr.
Rubenstein says he's "right on schedule" in winning
subscribers. After this week's trade show, Mr. Rubenstein
projects that the channel will "easily surpass" the start-up
target range for subscribers and be "close to 20 million
within 24 months of going on the air." He adds: "Cable
operators know they're going to add channels -- a bigger
package is what adds value and cash flow."
   Without the clout that Time Warner Inc. had to back the
start-up of its Comedy Channel or Viacom Inc. had for its HA]
channel, Mr. Rubenstein has had to woo operators with unusual
incentives. "Charter affiliates" get the first two years of
the Sci-Fi Channel free -- no license fees. In addition,
charter operators get stock options in the channel, 1% for
each 500,000 subscribers. Even so, most operators are taking
a wait-and-see attitude.
   Many cable operators are awaiting a possible merger
between the Comedy Channel and HA] before deciding to add
either, and other new channels have to get in line behind
those. But Mr. Rubenstein says he thinks his service
ultimately will prevail. "Our idea is different," he says.
"We don't have to worry about keeping people laughing."
   Surprisingly, Mr. Rubenstein isn't an avid science-fiction
fan. But he is a methodical businessman. He and his wife and
longtime partner, Laurie S. Silvers, Sci-Fi's chief operating
officer, parlayed a $5,000 investment in a tiny cable system
in Indiana into roughly half-ownership of a cable operation
that sold early last year for almost $30 million. Around the
same time, he also bought a UHF TV station in Orlando, Fla.
The Sci-Fi Channel will either build a production facility in
the Orlando area or use existing space. Mr. Rubenstein
wouldn't comment, but it's said that the channel may use
studio space owned by Walt Disney Co. or MCA Inc. in
connection with their Florida movie-studio tours.
   After coming up with the idea for the channel in 1988, Mr.
Rubenstein commissioned a Gallup survey, which indicated that
a science-fiction channel would be "at least as popular" as
Nickelodeon and MTV for viewers ages 12 to 49. Mr. Rubenstein
likes to say that nine of the top 10 films of all time, by
box-office revenue, are in the science-fiction, fantasy or
horror genres (he includes "Ghostbusters," "Jaws" and the
Indiana Jones movies). And he's aware that there's a solid
base of fanatically loyal science-fiction fans.
   The narrow niche is what will lead to success, Mr.
Rubenstein believes. He points to the Lifetime channel, which
floundered until it targeted its programming to women. The
Gallup survey found that the average viewer of the Sci-Fi
Channel would be a male 26 1/2 years old. Poll in hand, Mr.
Rubenstein will try to sell ads for athletic shoes, cars and
high-tech goods.
   He's reserved satellite space and designed a logo. He's
also hired a cable broker, Waller Capital Corp., to help woo
cable systems, and an investment banker, Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., to raise capital. Mr. Rubenstein figures it will
cost about $20 million to launch the channel, plus another
$30 million in operating costs over the next three to four
years before the channel becomes profitable.
   Much of the expense will come from producing and acquiring
programming. Some obvious targets, such as Paramount
Communications Inc.'s two syndicated "Star Trek" series, are
simply too expensive for the Sci-Fi Channel at this stage.
Mr. Rubenstein says he's negotiating for rights to a number
of other old films and television series. He says he's
interested in the mid-1960s science-fiction anthology "The
Outer Limits," and also in many little-remembered series,
such as ABC's late-1960s "The Invaders" with Roy Thinnes.
   Horror will be a small part of Sci-Fi's programming, but
mainly late at night and even then more in the nature of old
Boris Karloff movies (many of which are in the public domain)
than current slasher films. A "Haunted House" game show for
kids is planned.
   The channel has announced a number of original programs --
most notably "Isaac Asimov's Universe," for which Mr. Asimov
has created a robot detective character -- and dramatizations
of science-fiction and horror stories through an arrangement
with Bertelsmann AG's Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group
Inc.
   Other programs fall more into the lowcost talk-show genre,
such as "The Software Show" (computer news, mostly supplied
by software companies) and "The Comic Book Show" (in
conjunction with a big comic-book publisher). Mr. Rubenstein
also says he's exploring production partnerships with major
studios.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Rubenstein's main task is keeping the
channel in the public eye. In Atlanta, he held a news
conference to announce a tie-in with Omni magazine, in which
the companies will trade ads and Omni will sponsor Sci-Fi's
series on the U.S. space program. A public-relations firm is
issuing blizzards of news releases on the network, and Mr.
Rubenstein has bought ads in trade publications in an effort
to keep the industry buzzing. One of his early moves was to
sign up Mr. Asimov as an adviser and spokesman.
   On paper, the Sci-Fi Channel makes a certain amount of
sense. "Of all the concepts I've seen, this is the most
thoughtfully worked out," says cable analyst Larry Gerbrandt
of Paul Kagan Associates, Monterey, Calif. But Mr. Gerbrandt
cautions that the channel's timing is unfortunate, and
"they've got to hope for a break in the market."
   Still, he adds: "The industry is full of channels that
started out this way."
