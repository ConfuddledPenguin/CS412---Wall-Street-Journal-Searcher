   Service Resources Corp. said it received a commitment from
a unit of Household Finance Corp., Prospect Heights, Ill., to
refinance its existing debt obligations.

Household Commercial Financial Services Inc. includes a $15
million revolving credit loan and a $25 million term loan.

   The company said it will use part of the proceeds of the
refinancing to repay all of the principal and accrued and
unpaid interest on its 9% and 11.5% debentures, which have
been in default since November 1988.
   Service Resources said it isn't any longer pursuing the
sale of its sole operating subsidiary, the former CPY
Management Services Inc., which has formally changed its name
to Ameriscribe Inc. Ameriscribe provides mailroom and other
back-office support to users such as law firms.
