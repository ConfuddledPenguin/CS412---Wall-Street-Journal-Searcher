   B.A.T Industries PLC, the British conglomerate that
recently fended off a hostile takeover bid by Sir James
Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd., reported a 27% plunge
in first-quarter pretax profit, citing losses at its U.K.
insurance unit.
   Pretax profit totaled #231 million ($391 million), down
from #318 million a year earlier and below most analysts'
expectations. The company blamed the decline on winter storm
related claims at its Eagle Start insurance unit. Total sales
climbed 6.5% to #5.10 billion from #4.79 billion. Profit
after taxes and minority interests declined 37% to #119
million from #188 millions. Per-share earnings slipped to
7.93 pence from 12.31 pence.

   Chairman Patrick Sheehy said the first quarter "will not
be representative of the year as a whole. I expect the group
to be able to make solid progress in what is very much a
transitional year."
   B.A.T is in the process of completing the sale of several
large U.S. retail stores and the spinoff of its paper and
pulp manufacturer, Wiggins Teape Appleton.
