   NEW YORK -- In testimony marked by tense verbal exchanges,
Ivan F. Boesky admitted that he had lied to government
investigators, the stock exchange, on his federal tax returns
and in a book he wrote prior to his November 1986
plea-bargain agreement.
   Cross-examined by Thomas Puccio, the attorney for John A.
Mulheren Jr., Mr. Boesky said often that he couldn't remember
when he had lied, or how many times, even though "I did not
like lying." Mr. Boesky said, however, that since he agreed
to plead guilty to one felony count related to his trading,
he has been "extremely motivated to tell the truth."

   Mr. Boesky took the stand for the second day in the trial
of Mr. Mulheren, who is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. The
cooperation of Mr. Boesky, once Wall Street's best known
stock speculator, led to the indictment of Mr. Mulheren.
   Under cross-examination designed to undermine his
credibility as a government witness, Mr. Boesky acknowledged
that he lied under oath "several times" prior to his
appearance in this case. He admitted to lying to the
Securities and Exchange Commission about his receipt of
inside information regarding the takeover of SCM Corp. and
about his filing a false statement with the SEC in connection
with the ownership of Fischbach Corp. securities.
   "Can you tell me how many times you lied?" Mr. Puccio
asked. "No," Mr. Boesky replied. "Can you estimate?" Mr.
Puccio inquired. "No," Mr. Boesky said.
   Mr. Puccio was often sarcastic during the
cross-examination, which began late yesterday and will
continue today. "Do you know what a pathological liar is?" he
asked Mr. Boesky. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum wouldn't
allow Mr. Boesky to answer the question. At another point,
Mr. Puccio asked, "Do you like money, Mr. Boesky?" The
witness replied testily, "Of course, don't you?"
   Answering other questions, however, Mr. Boesky admitted
that his book, Merger Mania, was "incomplete and inaccurate
by omission." For example, Mr. Boesky said that he had failed
to tell readers that much of the money he made from his
investment in Getty Oil Corp., which was the target of a
takeover, was based on inside information Mr. Boesky obtained
illegally.
   Mr. Boesky also admitted that he lied on tax returns he
filed prior to his plea agreement. But he added that he had
since amended his returns and paid his taxes. Mr. Boesky said
that at the time of his arrest, he had assets of "less than
$1 billion and more than $100 million."
   By showing that Mr. Boesky's plea agreement left him a
very rich man, despite the $100 million he was required to
pay in fines, Mr. Puccio is expected to attempt to show that
Mr. Boesky is biased in favor of the government and may be
motivated to say anything prosecutors want him to say about
Mr. Mulheren. Mr. Boesky completed a three-year prison term
last month.
   Mr. Boesky appeared not to help the government's case in
one key piece of testimony involving trading of stock of Gulf
&amp; Western Inc. Mr. Boesky acknowledged that he discussed the
stock with Mr. Mulheren but he stopped short of saying his
talks involved directions to Mr. Mulheren to manipulate its
price, as the government alleged.
