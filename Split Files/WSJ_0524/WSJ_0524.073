   WASHINGTON -- Public opposition to a possible tax increase
has softened, but voters remain deeply divided over the
question, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found.
   Even as they debate the issue, however, an overwhelming
majority of voters believe a tax increase is probably coming
whether they want it or not. As Bush administration and
congressional negotiators meet to try to arrive at a strategy
for addressing the federal budget deficit, the poll found
that 89% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed believe a
tax increase is either very or somewhat likely this year.

   Voters are evenly divided over whether President Bush
should keep his campaign promise not to raise taxes, with 48%
saying he shouldn't raise taxes and 48% saying conditions
have changed enough to warrant abandoning the pledge. That is
a shift from previous polls, in which clear majorities of
voters said Mr. Bush shouldn't raise taxes. As recently as
last month, 57% said the president should stick to his
opposition to a tax increase.
   One reason for the shift in sentiment may be that the
budget summit has focused more attention on the continuing
deficit problem. "The deficit is in the news and on people's
minds," say pollsters Peter Hart, a Democrat, and Robert
Teeter, a Republican, who conducted the survey for The Wall
Street Journal and NBC News.
   Another reflection of heightened voter concern is that Mr.
Bush's job-approval rating for handling the nation's economy
slipped to 51%, its lowest level in the Journal/NBC poll,
from 59% in April. Those who disapprove of his handling of
the economy increased to 40% from 30%.
   Though the president hasn't said unequivocally that he
would accept a tax increase as part of a deficit accord,
voters clearly believe he's headed in that direction.
   Just more than half the voters -- 51% -- believe that
President Bush is already breaking his no-new-taxes vow. At
the same time, however, the poll indicates that the
president's substantial popularity may insulate him from much
blame if he does change course and accept an increase.
   Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed said it would make
little or no difference in their opinion of Mr. Bush if he
accepted a deficit-reduction proposal that included a tax
boost; another 12% said they would actually think more of him
for doing so. Only 17% said their opinion of the president
would go down.
   In fact, only 16% of the voters surveyed said Mr. Bush's
administration would be mostly to blame if taxes are raised.
Rather, 36% said they would assign the blame mostly to former
President Reagan's administration. And 30% would blame the
Democrats in Congress.
   The answers broke along party lines, however, with
Democrats and independents more likely to blame either
Republican administration, and Republicans more likely to
blame the Democrats in Congress.
   While opposition to a tax increase is softening, there's
certainly no broad consensus that it's the way to go. Asked
whether it would be better to live with the current budget
deficit or to raise taxes, a slim plurality -- 49% -- chose
raising taxes over the 43% that preferred to live with the
deficit. Those figures were influenced in part by voters' own
economic condition: A majority of upper-income and
middle-income workers preferred to raise taxes, while a
majority of lower-income workers preferred to live with the
deficit.
   And a strong majority of voters -- 59% -- said they would
oppose a comprehensive plan for reducing the deficit that
would include defense cuts, a freeze on most government
programs -- including Social Security -- and higher taxes,
even if President Bush and Congress both embraced the
proposal.
   But the weakening opposition to tax boosts in general was
also reflected when voters were asked their feelings about
specific possible tax increases. For instance, opposition to
increasing the income-tax rates for individuals declined to
70% from the 79% in a Journal/NBC poll conducted last
January; opposition to a gasoline-tax increase dropped to 55%
from 72%; opposition to a national sales tax, to 54% from
65%.
   Support for higher alcohol and tobacco taxes rose to 83%
from 78%. And voters who in December opposed raising the
capital-gains-tax rate by 52% to 42% are now about evenly
split, with 49% supporting raising the rate and 47% opposed.
The Bush administration, of course, is continuing to push for
a reduction in the rate.
   If taxes do have to be raised, the Journal/NBC poll found
voters evenly split over whether they would trust Mr. Bush or
Congress more to make the right decisions. Although the
administration has made a top priority of defending the
income-tax rates from increase, the poll indicated that,
given the choice, Americans would much rather see higher
rates for upper-income taxpayers than increased taxes on
gasoline: 68% would rather see the rates on wealthy people
increased, while only 28% would rather see the gasoline tax
rise.

   "One of President Bush's promises was that he would not
raise taxes. Do you think he should keep that promise, or do
you think conditions have changed and there are some things
for which he should now support a tax increase?"
