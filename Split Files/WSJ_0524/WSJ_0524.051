   NEW YORK -- In another sign that Nomura Securities Co. is
making a major commitment to program trading worldwide, the
Japanese firm said it hired Michael Halem from Salomon
Brothers Inc., a unit of Salomon Inc.
   Program trading is the simultaneous, rapid-fire buying or
selling of 15 or more stocks. A disputed form of such
trading, stock-index arbitrage, involves large,
computer-assisted stock sales or purchases with offsetting
tradings in stock-index futures. The new post for Mr. Halem,
31 years old, follows Nomura's recent hiring of Joseph R.
Schmuckler, who resigned from a pivotal program trading post
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a General Electric Co. unit, in
March to join Nomura.

   While at Salomon, Mr. Halem helped develop that firm's
extensive program trading efforts in Japanese stock markets.
