   SACRAMENTO -- The late Rep. Phil Burton was once asked to
describe the 45 California congressional districts he created
in secrecy in the early 1980s.
   "It's my contribution to modern art," Mr. Burton, a San
Francisco Democrat who was the unofficial boss of the
California delegation, replied.

   And art it was. Mr. Burton's districts swooped and dipped
through the social and physical landscape. Several districts
had pieces that touched only underwater.
   Prior to the Burton-drawn redistricting, California's
43-member House delegation had been divided nearly evenly, 22
Democrats and 21 Republicans. After the Burton plan went into
effect for the 1982 elections (a liberal-dominated state
Supreme Court ordered its use even though voters had rejected
it 2-1 via referendum), the delegation, two seats larger due
to population growth, had a 28-17 Democratic tilt.
   Mr. Burton's plan, universally regarded as a classic
gerrymander even by Democratic partisans, was so adroitly
drawn that despite Republican voter registration gains and an
overall GOP cast in congressional voting patterns, the
Democrats lost but one of their seats in the 1980s, leaving
the delegation with a 27-18 split today.
   As census-takers complete their count of California and
other states, partisan warriors are arming themselves for new
battles over reapportionment of congressional and legislative
districts. And it's clear that populous, fast-growing
California will be the major battleground.
   The political stakes are enormous.
   Because it has added six million people to its population
in the past decade, California will be awarded six or seven
new congressional seats, nearly half of those that will be
shifted from Frost Belt to Sun Belt states. The state's
congressional delegation, 51 or 52, will be the largest of
any state in the nation's history and California alone will
have a fifth of the electoral votes needed to elect a
president.
   Republicans want back the five seats Rep. Burton pilfered
a decade ago, and they want all the new seats. They also want
a better shake on state legislative seats, which were
similarly tilted to lock in Democratic control of the
statehouse.
   Democrats have seen their voter registration drop steadily
in California, falling below 50% for the first time in more
than a half-century. They lost seven of the nine
top-of-the-ticket elections in the 1980s and, until the
post-1980 census reapportionment, were seeing their margins
in congressional and legislative seats also shrink. To
Democrats, therefore, reapportionment is a matter of
political life and death. A fair reapportionment could mean
GOP control of the state Legislature and the congressional
delegation by the end of the decade.
   It's no wonder that leaders of both parties are pulling
out all the stops.
   Their immediate focus is on two ballot measures set for
June 5. Both have Republican sponsors, but there's a split in
GOP ranks between those who think reapportionment should be
removed entirely from the Legislature and those who want to
leave it but impose restrictions.
   The former measure, sponsored by San Mateo County
Supervisor Tom Huening, would create an independent
commission appointed by retired judges to draw new lines. The
latter, sponsored by Marin County businessman Gary Flynn,
would leave the task with the Legislature but require a
two-thirds vote, which would give Republicans a veto power.
   Democrats despise both measures but seem to dislike an
independent commission more -- it would negate the
possibility of a bipartisan, incumbent-protecting deal.
   The Democrats' chief warrior is Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, a colorful veteran of California political wars. Mr.
Brown has been hitting Democratic money sources, such as the
California Trial Lawyers Association and the California
Teachers Association, hard for endorsing the Huening measure
and has publicly denounced the League of Women Voters for
endorsing it. He suggested in one speech that the
organization's members should "go back to the kitchen."
   The GOP, meanwhile, has gotten initial support from
California corporate interests, such as Chevron and
Hewlett-Packard, but that, in turn, has created a backlash.
Corporate officials say privately that Democrats have warned
them that unless they match pro-GOP checks with
pro-Democratic money or refuse to contribute to the
reapportionment campaigns, they'll suffer the consequences on
legislation in both Sacramento and Washington.
   Both sides agree that as much as $12 million will be spent
by election day to sway voters, who seem to be leaning toward
passage of at least one of the proposals. Republicans are
hoping to capitalize on a wave of anti-politician sentiment
that stems from scandals in Washington and Sacramento, while
Democrats will portray the initiatives as partisan and power
grabs by special interests.
   If both of the measures are rejected, a second stage of
the California reapportionment battle will occur in November,
when voters choose a new governor to succeed retiring
Republican George Deukmejian. Under the current system, the
governor would have to sign any reapportionment bill from the
Legislature. GOP leaders had hoped that Mr. Deukmejian would
seek a third term to protect their interests on
reapportionment.
   When Mr. Deukmejian decided to retire, the Republican
chieftains turned almost desperately to the party figure they
believed had the best chance to keep the governor's office in
GOP hands -- Sen. Pete Wilson, who had just been elected to a
second term.
   Reapportionment loomed so large in the minds of
Republicans that even New Right conservatives agreed to Mr.
Wilson, a moderate former mayor of San Diego who had long
been anathema to the right because of his pro-choice,
pro-environment, pro-gay-rights positions. The Bush White
House pushed for making Mr. Wilson the consensus choice. Mr.
Wilson is favored to win the governorship against either of
the Democratic candidates, John Van de Kamp and Dianne
Feinstein.
   Either by voter decree or gubernatorial power, then, it's
probable that the Democratic hold on California politics, an
artificial grip that amounts to disenfranchisement for
millions of Californians and a denial of political reality,
will end.
