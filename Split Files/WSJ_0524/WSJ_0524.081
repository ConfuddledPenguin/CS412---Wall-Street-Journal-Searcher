   ST. LOUIS -- Twenty years ago, William Ross, then a
McDonnell Douglas Corp. manager, proudly supervised the birth
of the Air Force's F-15 Eagle, the hottest fighter of its
day. Now the gray-haired president of the company's fighter
division here, Mr. Ross is presiding over the jet's probable
demise.
   "She's an old, old friend," the former test pilot says
forlornly, looking up at the bundles of black and red wires
dangling from the half-finished frame of an F-15, an aircraft
the Pentagon wants to kill.

   A thousand miles to the east, the future looks brighter.
In a cramped Loral Corp. factory in a burned-out corner of
New York City's borough of the Bronx, dozens of workers at
microscopes and workbenches solder tiny circuits for
missile-warning devices used in military cockpits. The Cold
War may have ended, but the Pentagon still wants highly
sophisticated electronic equipment. So, Loral is investing
$10 million in new machinery over the next three years and
seeks to expand the plant's 700-person payroll.
   "The stuff we turn out is profitable, and people here feel
pretty good about the backlog of firm orders," says Rick
Morgan, the plant manager.
   The disparate fates of the two contractors underscore the
complexity of the defense industry's steepest nosedive since
World War II. Most of the industry, like McDonnell Douglas,
faces bleak times. At next week's U.S.-Soviet summit,
Presidents Bush and Gorbachev will nearly complete sweeping
agreements to cut stocks of chemical and nuclear weapons. By
the end of this decade -- barring a sharp deterioration in
the international climate -- Pentagon spending on new weapons
is likely to plummet 50%, and more than half a million
workers probably will be laid off. Texas, New York and some
New England states will be hit especially hard.
   But even in this difficult environment, surprisingly,
there will be a fair number of successes and a few big
winners. Visits to weapons plants across the country uncover
several major trends reshaping the defense industry,
strangling some companies and helping others.
   First, as nearly everybody knows, several major defense
contractors are struggling. By the end of the decade, one or
two probably will be swallowed up or quit the business
altogether. However, some giant defense companies will tough
it out and probably emerge from the shakeout stronger than
ever, with fewer competitors and bigger market shares.
   Another trend is common-sensical but less noticed: Lacking
the cash cushion and other lines of business that would
enable them to survive the cutbacks, many smaller defense
companies will disappear. But here again, concerns in certain
favored niches will thrive -- most notably, makers of space
systems, computer-related equipment, defense electronics and
communications gear, and training simulation packages.
   In addition, one rule of thumb divides defense contractors
both big and small: Nearly all that supply the Army are in
trouble, while most big Navy suppliers should ride out the
storm. That's because lawmakers and Pentagon brass seem
determined to maintain maritime superiority.
   Little recognized is the simple fact that the industry is
shrinking but not dying. Even in the post-Cold War world, as
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney observes, "we're still going to
be spending an awful lot of money on national security."
   The shrinkage will occur slowly. For one thing, the
Pentagon's unprecedented $260 billion order backlog will
cushion the blow and delay the bulk of layoffs for a few
years. Also, political pork-barreling has a way of keeping
outdated weapons alive. Lacking a long-term strategy,
Congress is reluctant to chop defense outlays as deeply as
many Pentagon critics are demanding.
   The varying reactions of big defense companies are
illustrated in the contrast between the nation's biggest
defense contractor, McDonnell Douglas, and the
second-biggest, General Dynamics Corp. Both are based in St.
Louis, but the similarities end there. McDonnell Douglas has
sunk into confusion, torn between its history of being the
industry's top gun and its hopes of prospering by selling
more commercial airliners. General Dynamics, meanwhile, sees
a potential jackpot in the industry's contraction and is
sticking to its guns.
   McDonnell Douglas executives talk a good game. "We were
the No. 1 defense contractor in 1980 when the Pentagon budget
was $150 billion," says Mr. Ross, the chief of the fighter
division, "and I intend to be the No. 1 defense contractor if
it goes back to $150 billion," half its present level. "We're
going to be a preferred supplier for the Defense Department,"
he vows, but then mutters, under his breath, "If there is
such a thing these days."
   Outsiders take a grimmer view. Dan Stanley, a former
McDonnell Douglas executive who is now an aide to Senate
Minority Leader Robert Dole, laments that the company's
military segment is practically "struggling for its
existence." Its cash-cow F-15 Eagle, designed in the early
1970s, is in deep trouble, with the Pentagon proposing to
stop buying it next fall, five years earlier than once
planned.
   So, like an ungainly battleship, McDonnell Douglas is
trying to turn toward the civilian market. It hopes over the
next few years to increase such sales to half its revenue
from one-third today. From Chairman John McDonnell on down,
managers are concentrating on helping the company's troubled
commercial-aircraft factory in Long Beach, Calif., get planes
out the door. Top executives say layoffs, by the end of the
1990s, could hit as much as one-third of the St. Louis
plant's 40,000 workers, and they hope to cushion the blow by
building parts for their commercial operations in California.
"Noses?" Mr. Ross says. "You want somebody to build noses for
you? We'll build them."
   Yet reality still hasn't fully sunk in. McDonnell Douglas
plays a major role in four of the government's five most
expensive new-weapons products, but nobody at the company
concedes that any of the programs are doomed.
   The misery of defense giants such as McDonnell Douglas and
Northrop Corp., which makes the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber,
may help a handful of other industry giants. As weaker rivals
bail out and the Pentagon goes back to doling out fat
single-source contracts, several behemoths may well grab
bigger pieces of the smaller defense-budget pie. Boeing Co.,
for example, aims to keep its annual revenue from the
Pentagon steady at about $5 billion, and industry observers
expect it to succeed. Similarly, General Electric Co. plans
to capitalize on its strong position producing nuclear
reactors for submarines, Navy missiles and various space
projects.
   The strong position of these likely winners is perhaps
clearest at General Dynamics. With its diverse contracts and
strength in Navy work, General Dynamics can afford to shrug
off talk of turning to commercial markets. Chairman Stanley
Pace concedes that the company could be 30% smaller, in real
terms, by the end of the decade. But with fewer competitors,
he says, it also will be stronger. "I look at a downturn as
an opportunity," he declares. General Dynamics has been there
before, skinnying down after the post-Vietnam defense cutback
and emerging, years later, stronger than ever.
   Today, the company looks robust at both the big-ticket and
moderate-price ends of the Pentagon market. Carrying a $1.8
billion price tag, its stealthy new attack submarine, the
Seawolf, would seem a natural target for budget-cutters. But
so far, the Navy steadfastly argues that it must upgrade its
sub fleet because of the Soviets' great technological
strides.
   At the other end of the scale, the company's F-16 Falcon,
though operational for nearly two decades, remains the only
reliable, low-cost, single-engine fighter available. Despite
talk of winding down the line in the late 1990s, Mr. Pace
thinks that an enhanced model could sell for many years,
given the lack of competition.
   Of course, some battles are looming. Secretary Cheney, in
his biggest swipe at the company, wants to shut down its M-1
tank plants in Michigan and Ohio by early 1993 -- the only
tank factories still open in the U.S. But General Dynamics
will fight him, and it may have Congress on its side. "If
they know for sure there are never going to be any more tank
battles in the world, then, swell, mothball the M-1," Mr.
Pace says. "But if they want to have some sort of an
insurance policy," he adds, the U.S. must keep building them.
   "The important thing" for a company to do, he adds, is to
"stay calm, sweat it out and come through the best you can."
   Pentagon planners, for example, want to stop buying
General Dynamics' Tomahawk cruise missile in 1993. But the
company may keep it alive by finding uses for it in addition
to its original mission of flying nuclear warheads into World
War III. "We want to highlight the Tomahawk's flexibility, to
show that this is the kind of thing you can use in Panama,"
says Brad Beaver, manager of the company's cruise-missile
factory in San Diego.
   Mr. Beaver's efforts are typical of defense-industry moves
to keep prized projects alive. Improvements will allow the
Tomahawk to fly more than 1,400 miles before hitting a
target, he says, "even if it moves around, like Gadhafi's
tent." The Navy connection helps here, too: Because the
Tomahawk is fired from submarine tubes or destroyer decks,
General Dynamics contends that it will become more valuable
as foreign bases disappear. Sea-based cruise missiles also
are less likely to be trimmed in arms-control negotiations.
   It's too early to say whether Mr. Beaver will win his case
on the Tomahawk, which brought General Dynamics $230 million
last year -- about 2% of its sales. But no matter what
happens, the company isn't "going to jump into a lot of new
areas just to say we're there," says its chief financial
officer, Jim Cunnane.
   At the opposite end of the industry are hundreds of
smaller companies in the wrong lines, such as building
infantry equipment for the Army. They will be the biggest
losers in the shakeout.
   At Harsco Corp.'s plant in York, Pa., for example,
camouflage-painted armored vehicles growl and rumble around
the test track like so many dinosaurs. The equipment was
designed for a European land war that few now anticipate.
   "We have thought about getting out of the defense business
for at least two years, but nobody wanted to buy," says
Malcolm Gambill, Harsco's president. "We would have had to
give the assets away." Instead, over the past two years, the
company has taken $110 million in write-offs on its defense
work and laid off more than 40% of the 3,000 employees at its
defense unit.
   Like many other small and medium-sized contractors, the
killing blow to Harsco's defense business may be the loss of
its suppliers. Thousands of subcontractors in almost every
segment of the defense field have already quit. "Contractors
are now having trouble getting subcontractors," says Don
Fuqua, who heads the Aerospace Industries Association.
   Despite its own cash crunch, Harsco has shelled out
millions over the years to keep alive one small
subcontractor, Rogers Olympic Corp. Harsco says the parts
made by the Seattle metal-forming shop are crucial to its
production lines, but adds that it no longer can afford to
help the family-run company. So, Rogers is folding.
   Yet here and there among the smaller contractors are some
big winners. Companies such as Loral, E-Systems Inc.,
California Microwave Inc. and many other specialty
contractors are nestled in niches that will do well no matter
how deeply Congress cuts defense outlays.
   At Loral, these are boom times. "Whatever the defense
budget is going to be in the 1990s, it's going to be
dominated by electronics," Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz
asserts.
   At the company's 40-year-old plant in the Bronx,
surrounded by torn-up streets and shuttered auto-body shops,
locally hired workers sit elbow-to-elbow assembling miniature
circuits. The circuits will go into radar-warning devices --
the "black boxes" intended to help Air Force pilots evade
missiles. In contravention of conventional wisdom, the
inner-city operation has been Loral's biggest money-maker.
   Electronics gear accounts for nearly half the price tag of
each new fighter rolling off an assembly line. But unlike
McDonnell Douglas and other aircraft makers, Loral will
profit handsomely even if the next generation of planes never
gets off the drawing board. If the Pentagon keeps flying its
old planes, it still will need to update their electronic
guts.
   Other companies also are eyeing this multibillion-dollar
corner of the industry, which makes everything from
submarine-detection gear to reconnaissance drones to
high-resolution radar. But Loral isn't fazed. While most of
its competitors are conservatively hoarding their cash, Loral
has been swallowing other companies. "We're thinking
acquisition every day," Mr. Schwartz says.
   So far, the strategy has worked. While an industry power
such as Northrop faces the grim prospect of shrinking into a
lackluster subcontractor, Loral has nearly doubled its annual
revenue over the past four fiscal years, to $1.27 billion,
and its operating income has steadily increased to more than
$148 million.
   "We're becoming dominant in some parts of the industry,"
says Mr. Schwartz, who relishes his image as a maverick
entrepreneur. "It's safer than switching to the hairspray
business."
