   The place, beside the main road into Rishon Lezion, is
known locally as "the slave market." It's where Palestinian
laborers wait in hope of getting a day's work in construction
or fruit picking from Israeli contractors. Here, last Sunday,
21-year-old Ami Popper killed seven Palestinians and wounded
10 with an automatic rifle.
   The word from Israeli authorities was that Popper was
"deranged." It was suggested he may have been sexually
assaulted by an Arab when he was 13. So if the assault story
was true, you could say in a way Palestinians brought it on
themselves. Mind you, if a Palestinian shot seven Jews, no
one would bother with psychiatric discrimination. He'd be a
"terrorist" and he'd stay a "terrorist," even if it turned
out that at the age of 13 he'd seen his pregnant mother
beaten half to death by Israeli soldiers and his younger
brother blinded by a rubber bullet.

   Not everyone bought the "crazed killer" theory. Two of
Popper's neighbors told Newsday he was "a really nice kid"
and not mad at all. Refusing requests from Popper's lawyer
and from the police that he be hospitalized for psychiatric
observation, Judge Davide Mualam remarked, "Most of those who
commit serious crimes are emotionally stable, both legally
and medically."
   With truly remarkable chutzpa, propagandists like Steven
Emerson (who had a piece on this paper's editorial page
Tuesday) claimed that Israel somehow emerged with enhanced
moral standing with "values and conscience" excellently
demonstrated by the speed with which Popper's deed was
condemned by Israelis, including government leaders.
   But what did Israelis leaders actually do after Popper's
spree? They ordered more savage repression. Headlines couched
thus, "Lone Israeli Slays 7 Palestinians; 7 More Arabs Killed
as Riots Erupt" don't give us the active mathematics of
retaliation. The headline should have read, "Popper kills 7
Palestinians, Then Army Kills 7 More, Wounds 700."
   The idea seems to be that Palestinians would feel better
about the Popper killings if they understood that the gunman
was nuts, rather than merely having a bad day or even feeling
great. The trouble is, when you are continuously, month after
month, on the receiving end of rational, coolly calculated
violence you probably don't stop to ask yourself, how will
Ami Popper make out on his inkblot test? You go ahead and
throw a rock.
   Here are a few instances of rationality as recently
experienced by Palestinians:
   -- Last year, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, leader of the Gush
Emunim fanatics, fired indiscriminately at Palestinians in
Hebron after his car had been hit by stones. He killed a
shopkeeper and was arrested. According to Israeli
human-rights activist Prof. Israel Shahak, "Shortly before
(the Popper) massacre the Israeli media extensively covered
statements and events inciting Israeli Jews to kill Arabs."
Rabbi Levinger, sentenced to five months for slaying the
Palestinian shopkeeper, was honored at a celebration in
Elkana prior to entering prison by -- according to the May 18
Ha'aretz, Israel's largest daily, Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai,
military commander of the West Bank. Also present was Chaim
Herzog, Israel's president.
   After the event, Rabbi Levinger was taken to prison on the
shoulders of his supporters. Earlier, Rabbi Moshe Neriya
published a statement for this occasion, quoted in Ha'aretz
for May 13, in which the rabbi enjoined every Jew "to shoot
(Arabs) left and right without thinking and without
hesitating." According to Prof. Shahak, this statement was
scarcely condemned by politicians.
   -- A former army commander, Lt. Col. Yehuda Meir, is now
being tried in military court, accused of systematically
breaking the arms and legs of people in the West Bank
villages of Huwara and Beita. Col. Meir had been quietly
released by the army after the incidents, but protests from
some Knesset members forced a trial. He is not being called
deranged. The persons so beaten were on a list and, as the
periodical Middle East International says, "The court has
heard hair-raising accounts of the `operation' in which
victims were hauled from their homes, showing no resistance;
then, while shackled, their limbs were shattered with clubs.
Senior officers testified that Meir's orders were in flagrant
defiance of official policy. Judicial observers do not expect
Meir to receive anything more than a token sentence."
   What do Palestinians see, as they peer about in search of
a rational world in which they could follow the tranquil
command of the U.S. government and press to stay off the
streets and wait for the "peace process" to unfold?
   Yitzhak Shamir is now seeking to cobble together an
alliance of the far right, which might even include as
defense minister his enemy Ariel Sharon, who pledges to end
the "intifada" quickly with "no questions asked" (i.e.
Popperism writ large). Desirous of the police ministry is
Rehavam Ze'evi, a member of a party that seeks mass
deportations of Palestinians. The present deputy foreign
minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, also favors mass deportation.
   At the moment Palestinians were protesting Popper's
slayings and Steven Emerson was formulating his column about
Israeli leaders' compassionate response, a committee of the
Knesset was voting more than $17 million for road-building
and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. A
Jerusalem-based think tank, the Institute for Advanced
Strategic and Political Studies, recently issued a report
that it claimed represented "a wall-to-wall consensus of
Israel's military and strategic communities." The Jewish Week
reports a prime conclusion of the report was that "giving up
territory for an Arab state in the West Bank and/or Gaza is
`unthinkable' for Israel," even if such a state was, as the
report's editor said, "ruled by the Boy Scouts of America."
   The report, called "Can Israel Survive a Palestinian
State?" was launched at the National Press Club in
Washington, and clearly aimed at an American audience. As of
May 4 no Hebrew-language version had been put out.
   In other words, it's clearly the consensus of Israel's
political elite that they can outstay any U.S. pressure --
though none has been exerted -- to make any concessions to
Palestinians. They can continue to crush the "intifada" and
look to the time when the so-called Palestinian "demographic
time-bomb" will be countered by the arrival of Soviet Jews,
estimated at one million by 1993. This will make Israel even
more determined to hold on to the West Bank and its crucial
water supply.
   For their part, "moderate" Palestinian leaders who went on
hunger strikes after the Popper killings see that talking to
U.S. officials is getting them nowhere.
   There's no internal political pressure for these officials
to do anything serious. And so nothing serious has been done.
Most U.S. politicians cower in terror at the American-Jewish
lobby, even though public opinion is ahead of them. Israel's
leaders reckon they have nothing to fear from the U.S. as
they try to stamp out all Palestinian resistance.
   Within the terms of Israel's policy toward Palestinians,
Ami Popper perpetrated an entirely rational act.
