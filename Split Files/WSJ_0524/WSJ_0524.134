   Sea-Land Services Inc. said it reached agreements with
cargo-shipping interests in the Soviet Union for Sea-Land to
share its transportation information and management systems.
   Alex Mandl, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sea-Land, an ocean container ship company, said Sea-Land will
help the Soviets improve their handling of containerized
freight on the Trans-Siberian Railroad between Asia and
Europe. Mr. Mandl said Sea-Land will provide information and
management resources, but not major capital dollars.

   Edison, N.J.-based Sea-Land is a unit of CSX Corp., a
transportation and resource company based in Richmond, Va.
   "This is an effort with modest investment to expand our
distribution network into that part of the world," said Mr.
Mandl. He added that Sea-Land seeks to participate in fees
generated by the venture from freight shipments. "It won't
translate into huge dollars for us next month, but it will
generate good potential for us down the road and it's another
step in the U.S. and Russia being able to work together," he
said.
