   DeKalb Energy Co. said it purchased an interest in 36
onshore oil and gas fields that it believes will increase its
proven U.S. reserves by more than 70%.
   The $130.2 million acquisition from Pittsburgh-based Royal
Producing Corp. Texas involves approximately 250 producing
wells, most of them located on the Texas Gulf Coast, and
continues DeKalb's announced strategy of concentrating its
activity in that region. The Denver-based oil and gas
producer acquired interests in 17 offshore lease blocks
earlier this year and has opened a Houston exploration
office.

   Bruce P. Bickner, DeKalb's chairman and chief executive,
said proven reserves from the properties are approximately
5.3 million barrels of oil and condensate and 50.4 billion
cubic feet of natural gas.
