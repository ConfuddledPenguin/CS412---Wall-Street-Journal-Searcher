   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a sweeping clean-air bill
after adding a $250 million unemployment-assistance program
that the White House said would result in a veto of the
measure.
   The clean-air bill, approved 401-21 last night, now goes
to what may be a long and contentious conference with the
Senate, which approved its clean-air bill last month. Among
other differences, the Senate measure doesn't contain a
worker-aid package.

   Nevertheless, Congress seems all but certain to approve
the first clean-air bill since 1977. The legislation would
impose the nation's first controls on acid rain, which is
hurting lakes and forests in the Northeast; would reduce the
toxic emissions from chemical companies and other factories
that are blamed for cancer and birth defects; and would take
a new approach to cleaning up smog by tailoring deadlines to
cities' pollution problems.
   The House bill is slightly less costly than the Senate
measure, which would impose $21.5 billion a year in costs on
industry when it is fully in effect.
   Just before final passage, the House voted 405-15 to
launch a pilot program in California in which the auto
industry would be required to produce cars capable of running
on nongasoline fuels such as natural gas and methanol. The
program would start in 1994 and result in the production of a
total 750,000 cars through 1997.
   The compromise amendment, which also contains an
alternative-fuels program for fleet vehicles, reflected a
hard-fought compromise between Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.), who originally sponsored an amendment requiring the
production and sale of one million alternative-fuel cars
annually, and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the Energy and
Commerce Committee chairman, who opposed any production
requirement. However, neither man is committed to the
compromise through the conference.
   The politics of the alternative-fuels compromise were
linked with the worker-assistance package. At one point
yesterday, industry opponents of the alternative-fuels
program were fearful that an angry White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu would throw support to the environmentalists in
retaliation for industry's support of the jobs program.
   The five year unemployment-assistance program, offered by
Rep. Robert Wise (D., W.Va.) and approved 274-146, would
provide up to six months of additional unemployment insurance
benefits and up to two years of retraining assistance to any
workers who lose their jobs or have their employment
substantially reduced as a result of the bill. To be eligible
for the assistance, the workers would have to demonstrate
that the law was an "important contributing factor" to the
job displacement.
   In the Senate, a similar measure backed by Sen. Robert
Byrd (D., W.Va.), was narrowly defeated. Sen. Byrd's proposal
was more costly and would have given coal miners more
generous benefits than other workers received.
   The Bush administration issued the veto threat in a letter
Tuesday to House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) from Mr.
Sununu and Environmental Protection Administrator William
Reilly. It said the amendment would create "a potentially
open-ended liability for the federal government" because
there would be no way to determine whether workers lost their
jobs because of the clean-air act or for another reason.
   In floor action yesterday, the House also voted 239-180 to
toughen warranty provisions for anti-pollution equipment.
Under the amendment, auto makers would be required to provide
eight-year, 80,000-mile warranties for catalytic converters
and electronic-diagnostic gear. For other equipment, the
warranties would be for two years or 24,000 miles. The change
made the House bill the same as the Senate's on this issue.
   The lawmakers also unanimously agreed to speed up the
required phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals
that are depleting the Earth's protective ozone layer. This
change also makes the bill conform closely to the Senate's
provisions.
   In addition, the House approved on voice vote a package of
amendments that were previously accepted by the Energy and
Commerce Committee and House leaders. The provisions would
require the use of cleaner gasoline in all cars in the
nation's nine smoggiest areas, beginning in 1992 and would
require the EPA to identify and regulate the source of haze
in western national parks within two years.
   Major provisions of the legislation are described below.
                                                                                                       

   AUTOMOBILES: The House and Senate bills contain different
triggers for determining whether to impose a second round of
curbs on tailpipe emissions.
   Both measures call for a mandatory initial round of cuts
totaling 60% for nitrogen oxide and 40% for hydrocarbons;
these reductions would be phased in starting with 1994 models
in the House and with 1993 models in the Senate. The EPA
estimates that this requirement would add $100 to the price
of a car.
   Under the House measure, a second round of cuts -- halving
exhaust levels for the pollutants -- would be required for
2003 model cars only if an EPA study decided they were needed
and cost-effective. Under the Senate bill, this second round
would be contingent on the nation's air quality.
Specifically, it would automatically take effect if 12 or
more seriously polluted cities outside California don't meet
EPA health standards by the end of 2001. The EPA estimates
the second round would add $500 to the price of a car.
   The House language is preferred by the industry and the
Bush administration.
                                                                                                       

   UTILITIES: The House and Senate take slightly different
approaches to dividing up "pollution credits" among
utilities.
   Provisions in both measures aimed at curbing acid rain
would require the nation's utilities to reduce sulfur-dioxide
pollution by 10 million tons a year from 1980 levels during
the next decade and to maintain those reductions. Both bills
would preserve the innovative trading system, proposed by
President Bush, under which utilities that make extra-deep
cuts in pollution would get credits they could keep or sell
to other utilities that want to expand.
   Each bill, however, makes its own adjustment with the
system to dole out extra credits to help the dirtiest
utilities pay their cleanup costs and to help other utilities
in fast-growing areas, among other groups. The House
generates these extra credits in part by requiring slightly
deeper cuts from the large dirty utilities affected by the
first phase of the legislation. The Senate speeds up the
deadline for each of the legislation's two phases by one
year.
   The United Mine Workers contends that the House bill would
result in the loss of 12,000 to 15,000 high-sulfur
coal-mining jobs, and that the Senate bill would result in
the loss of more than 15,000 jobs.
   The House also would require the EPA to identify and
regulate the source of haze in western national parks within
two years. The Senate calls only for a study.
                                                                                                       

   FUEL: The oil industry would have more flexibility under
the House bill in meeting requirements for cleaner-burning
reformulated gasoline to be sold in the nation's nine
smoggiest areas.
   To the dismay of the oil industry, which has lobbied
vigorously against the provisions, both bills would force all
gasoline sold in these areas, starting in 1992, to be at
least as clean as that produced according to a government
formula. The Senate would actually require that the fuel meet
a specific oxygen content in each year; the House gives the
companies more leeway.
   In addition, both bills would would phase in an
alternative -- fuels program for fleets requiring the use of
non-gasoline fuels such as compressed natural gas.
                                                                                                       

   OTHER INDUSTRIES: The Senate threatens to force factories
to close down if they can't adequately reduce cancer risk
from their emissions, although it offers coke ovens a 30-year
exemption. The House contains no closing threat.
   Both measures would junk a regulatory system that has set
standards on air emissions for only seven toxic chemicals in
20 years. Instead, each bill would require a majority of
polluting plants -- ranging from petrochemical plants to dry
cleaners -- to install this state-of-the-art technology over
10 years; the goal would be to eliminate at least 2,200
annual cancer deaths from toxic industrial emissions, while
also reducing birth defects and respiratory diseases.
   Under the House bill, which is generally preferred by
environmentalists and industry, the EPA would then conduct a
risk-assessment study and make recommendations to Congress.
If Congress doesn't act, current-law provisions go into
effect requiring nearby residents to be protected within an
ample margin of safety. The Senate measure adopts a
health-based standard that would force a plant to close if it
couldn't reduce the cancer risk from its fumes to no more
than 1-in-10,000 for nearby residents. Congress could change
the standard after a risk-assessment study.
