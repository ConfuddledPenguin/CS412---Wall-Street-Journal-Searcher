   Standard Products, which is mainly a producer of rubber
and plastic parts for cars and trucks, in 1989 bought Holm
Industries, a maker of plastic and magnetic door seals for
home appliances and residential doors. The newly acquired
unit will complement the Holm operations, Standard Products
said.
