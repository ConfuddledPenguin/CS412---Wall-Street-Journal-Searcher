   But the Tokyo-based company also is predicting some trying
circumstances ahead, such as fierce competition to result
from easing of the large-scale retail store regulation, which
enables foreign department stores to make inroads to Japan.
   For the full year, Tokyu forecasts that sales will reach
387 billion yen from 346.523 billion yen the previous year.
Net income is estimated at around 5.7 billion, up from 5.189
billion yen in the prior fiscal year.
