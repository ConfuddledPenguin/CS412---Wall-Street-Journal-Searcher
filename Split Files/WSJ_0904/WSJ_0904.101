   TOKYO -- The Japanese government called in the leaders of
six major manufacturing industries and urged their "utmost
cooperation" in supplying U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Cooperation would include adding production capacity to
meet the needs of U.S. and other forces challenging Iraq,
shipping the forces goods intended for other customers and
billing the goods at cost, government officials said.

   The Japanese government would foot the bill for the goods
as part of the $1 billion in assistance to the multinational
forces it pledged a week ago, officials said.
   The Japanese government will purchase items in the name of
U.S. forces, from foreign suppliers as well as Japanese. But
the emphasis will be on Japanese suppliers, because the
government can more easily persuade Japanese companies to
bill at cost.
   The industry leaders called in by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry were the heads of industry
associations for construction equipment, industrial
machinery, automobiles, iron and steel, electronics and
plastics.
   The government has been stung by international criticism
that its contribution in the Persian Gulf crisis was too
little, too late. While denying that there will be a second
package of measures beyond those announced Wednesday, the
officials tried to flesh out details of previously vague
promises and explain points that may have been misunderstood
overseas.
