   Royal Trustco Ltd. said it sold the Hong Kong and
Singapore-based asset-management operations of its Royal
Trust Asset Management Asia Ltd. unit to Credit Lyonnais.
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed. Royal Trust said it
expects to report a gain on the sale, but that it will have
"no material effect" on Royal Trustco's profits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Royal Trust said the operations being sold don't fit into
its strategic plans to concentrate internationally on areas
such as private banking or client portfolio management and
specialized corporate finance, areas in which the company
says it has competitive strength.
   Royal Trust is a Toronto-based trust company. Credit
Lyonnais is a major French financial services institution.
