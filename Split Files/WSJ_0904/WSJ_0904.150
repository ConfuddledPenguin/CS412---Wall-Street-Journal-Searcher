   BAGHDAD -- If the economic noose is tightening around
Iraq, this city of four million seems determined to revel on
the gallows.
   On a sultry Saturday night, the only rumblings of war are
on the screen of the Sinbad Cinema, where an Indian battle
film is playing. Kebab sellers on the street outside the
theatre are skewering fat chunks of lamb while fruitmongers
slash open fresh watermelons. Along the Tigris River, men
promenade hand in hand, in the Arab fashion, past fish
restaurants and neon-lit nightclubs. A raucous group of
wedding revelers sweeps through the Sheraton Hotel lobby,
seemingly oblivious to nearby Western hostages.

   There are bread lines, and rationing of staples such as
rice, but the shops and street souks are flush with other
goods, even some luxuries. Heaps of Chilean oranges, Canada
Dry sodas, processed cheese -- all seized from Kuwait's rich
storehouses -- tempt shoppers.
   Nor is the prospect of belt-tightening causing much alarm.
Tea-sellers still fill their tiny glasses half-full with
sugar, a product in short supply.
   "America cannot scare us with its guns and sanctions,"
says an engineer named Abdullah, playing dominoes at a
riverside teahouse. He rolls up his pant leg to reveal an
ugly cross-stitch running down his leg -- the result of a
shrapnel wound during Iraq's long war with Iran. "My friend,"
he says, returning to his game, "we know about war, we are
ready. Is America?"
   Such attitudes reflect in part Iraq's unique perception of
the current crisis. Nightly newscasts have an Iraqi bias so
profound that one is left thinking that the U.S. -- not Iraq
-- is under siege. Newspaper cartoons show camels urinating
on U.S. soldiers in the desert. Only a small elite listening
to the BBC or Voice of America appears to have any grasp of
the gravity of Iraq's situation.
   "From the ministries to the street, Iraqis are in various
dreamstates," says one Western diplomat, "they think Kuwait
is theirs forever and convincing the world of this is simply
a mop-up operation."
   At heart, Iraqi leaders seem to believe the whole crisis
will blow over. But if it doesn't, they appear braced for
mass destruction. "We're talking twilight of the gods," says
one diplomat of his conversations with Iraqi officials. "If
Iraq is attacked, the whole world burns."
   Short of such an Armageddon, diplomats here say that
severe food shortages may be the only way to turn Iraq's
muted populace against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Yet they
doubt the embargo will bite hard enough and quickly enough to
destabilize the Iraqi regime. Iraq trumpets its
self-sufficiency in newspaper reports and interviews with the
Western press. "Even if we must eat mud, we will not kneel
down to any power," says Naji al-Hadithi, Iraq's director
general of information.
   While Iraq imports three-quarters of its food, it is
enjoying a bumper crop of fruit, vegetables and grain. The
Iraqi diet already is deteriorating, but "the notion that
people here will be starved into submission is wishful
Western thinking," says a veteran diplomat.
   Over the short term, Iraq's ability to weather the crisis
depends largely on how it nurses its current stocks. It has
distinct advantages in a highly disciplined and authoritarian
society and a population inured to shortages during its long
war with Iran. The regime already has closed ice-cream
parlors and pastry shops. Top restaurants are expected to
shut soon. Bread sales are limited to three small loaves per
person, per day, and bakeries can only make coarse wholemeal
breads. On Saturday, rationing of staples such as tea and
rice was introduced. To enforce its measures, the regime has
decreed that black marketeers will be put to death.
   If the embargo holds, Iraq can only survive by reviving
its badly neglected agriculture. Currently, yields are poor
and 20% of all crops are lost through bad storage. Iraq
relies heavily on imported seeds and machinery, as well as on
Egyptian labor, which is fleeing the country. According to
official figures publicized before the crisis, Iraq has
enough rice for 70 days and sugar for only 17.
   But in a land once known as the Fertile Crescent, there is
water, sun and land in abundance. The world's largest date
producer, Iraq could press dates to make a syrup substitute
for dwindling supplies of sugar. Iraq has a population that
was predominantly rural only a generation ago. Saddam Hussein
could decree that some workers return to the land to farm
collectively, or tell urban dwellers to raise chickens. "The
Iraqis could go Vietnamese on us and rediscover their rural
roots," says the Western ambassador.
   This theory finds some support in conversations with
Iraqis. At a bread line in downtown Baghdad, one woman says
she's growing vegetables in her yard for the first time in
years. "It is more fun than changing diapers," she observes.
The old man behind her says he has been living with his son
and daughter-in-law for four years and now, at least, can
contribute to the household larder by waiting in line for
bread. In the serpentine alleys of the souk, a young
pharmacist named Tariq points to his dwindling stock of
imported goods and says that his father used to wash his hair
with camel's urine, an old Bedouin custom. "We do not need
your Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo," he says.
   If the embargo continues, Iraqis may have little choice
but to return to their roots. Iraq's small industrial base is
shutting down quickly for lack of spare parts. Major capital
projects, including dams and petrochemical plants that rely
heavily on Western machinery and experts, are being
mothballed. Oil fields are closing. And even this is
difficult to do properly without foreign advice and
equipment.
   Ironically, Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait may have
been partly motivated by the desire to improve Iraq's
standard of living. Diplomats believe that the Iraqi dictator
was eager to forestall any Romanian-style uprising against
his regime, which has often been compared to that of Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Early this year, Baghdad flooded the market with consumer
products. Moves toward privatizing the economy were stepped
up. Saddam Hussein resumed an old habit of appearing in Iraqi
homes -- TV cameras in tow -- to bestow Toyotas,
refrigerators and fistfuls of dinars on surprised and
grateful citizens. The overpowering personality cult -- so
reminiscent of Mr. Ceausescu's -- seems to have been toned
down. Longstanding strictures on contact with the outside
world were eased.
   But now that the midnight raid on Kuwait has been so
widely condemned, all evidence of openness has vanished. The
capital is once again "Moscow-on-the-Tigris," as it was
dubbed during the Iran-Iraq war. Anti-aircraft guns, removed
or left unmanned after the cease-fire with Iran, are visible
along the river's bank. Overseas travel is banned, and telex
and telephone lines have been cut or carefully controlled.
   The Arabic service of the BBC is jammed, and the airwaves
and newspapers are filled with displays of martial might and
propaganda. Iraqis have been told that the Kuwaiti royal
family is riddled with syphilis; that Israeli rabbis are
ministering to U.S. troops in Mecca and Medina, the holy
Muslim sites on the opposite side of Saudi Arabia from where
the soldiers are actually deployed; and that demonstrators
from Amman to Berkeley, Calif., support Iraq in its struggle
against American-Zionist colonial oppression.
   Asked if Iraq under any circumstances would consider
withdrawing from Kuwait, the information ministry official,
Mr. al-Hadithi replies with an unwavering no. "It has come
back to the motherland," he says of Kuwait. The two
countries' currencies and courts have been merged, and Kuwait
has already been incorporated in Iraq in official maps.
   Returning to Baghdad from his first trip to Europe in 10
years, an Iraqi intellectual confesses, "I feel like I am
going back to prison after a brief, wonderful parole."
   Perhaps over time this isolation may arouse opposition
within Saddam Hussein's ruling clique or the population at
large, but there is little cause for optimism. Baghdad's
modern sprawl of dun-colored apartments and blue-domed
mosques is so thick with informers and secret police that no
conversation is without menace. A merchant's fluent English
will suddenly falter when talk turns to politics. A Westerner
inquiring about a bread line will be told that it is actually
a queue of volunteers signing up to fight America. Most
often, any questions of a sensitive nature are parried with a
polite smile followed by silence.
   Still, there is little of the obvious and genuine venom
toward America evident in Jordan and on the Israeli-occupied
West Bank. In contrast to Palestinians, who feel deeply stung
by U.S. support for Israel, Iraqis' enmity toward the U.S.
seems abstract. Iraqis seem more befuddled than embittered by
America's action over Kuwait.
   By Arab standards, Iraq is a secular society, comfortable
with Western habits that disgust Muslim fundamentalists:
drinking, materialism, women's liberation. "Ninety-nine
percent of Iraqis despise America," insists a psychiatrist
named Ali Harchan, marching Monday in a stage-managed rally
at the American Embassy, an almost daily ritual in Baghdad.
   But as the protesters stop shaking their fists and
shouting "Down, down Bush]" Dr. Harchan begins chatting about
his affection for the "Newhart" show (prime time on Iraqi TV)
and about the beautiful blond women he met while studying in
Europe. "Please write that Ali says Hi to all his friends in
Detroit," he says before melting away into the shimmering
midday heat.
   Dr. Harchan and other Iraqis tell of panic in the days
immediately following the invasion of Kuwait. Families loaded
up cars and headed for the countryside, or frantically
hoarded food. Diplomats say that grocers and maids who had
never expressed an opinion about anything suddenly began
sharing their fears of U.S. attack.
   While this initial terror has passed, there is still
grumbling about shortages. And well-dressed diners in a
downtown restaurant unashamedly wrap up leftover bread and
slip it into their pockets before paying their bill.
   "Here we are, just finished with one war and starting
another," says an Iraqi office worker, speaking softly under
cover of a loud, humming air-conditioner. Like many Iraqis,
he has sons just recently demobilized from the Iranian front
who now are being deployed in Kuwait. "If America kills
Saddam, many people here will think the Prophet Mohammed is
alive and well in Washington," he says. Asked whom he would
prefer in power, the man says, "Who cares? Let us have the
devil. Even he would be better than this madman, Saddam
Hussein."
   The man quickly adds that his views represent a tiny
minority of Iraqis with some exposure to the West. In the
drawer of his desk are smuggled copies of Time and Newsweek,
concealed in double brown bags, as though they were
pornography. "Without this," he says, "I would be a sheep
like everyone else."
