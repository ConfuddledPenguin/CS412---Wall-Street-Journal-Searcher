   ZURICH -- Switzerland's gross domestic product slowed in
the second quarter, but the economy still grew at a
surprisingly strong rate, according to the Federal Office for
Economic Questions.
   GDP grew at a real annualized rate of 1.6% from the first
quarter, and 3.0% from the 1989 second quarter, the office
said.

   A spokesman described the slowdown as "not very strong"
and said growth was still "surprisingly good." However, in
the second half, GDP growth is forecast to slow to an
annualized rate of 1%, reflecting what is expected to be a
stagnating construction sector.
