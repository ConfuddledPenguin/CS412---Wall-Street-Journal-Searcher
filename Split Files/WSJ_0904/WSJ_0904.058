   MILAN, Italy -- Bruno Pazzi, 78 years old, was appointed
president of Consob, Italy's stock-market regulatory agency,
filling the vacancy left when Franco Piga was appointed
minister of state industry in July.
   Mr. Pazzi, who was appointed a Consob commissioner in
1978, was already serving as acting president following Mr.
Piga's departure. Before joining Consob, Mr. Pazzi held
several positions in Italy's beverage and distilling
industry.
