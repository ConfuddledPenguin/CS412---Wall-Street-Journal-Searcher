   WASHINGTON -- Brazil agreed to an economic-adjustment
program with the International Monetary Fund, but a few
details haven't been determined, officials said, including
the exact amount of money the multilateral agency will lend.
   These details should be settled soon, after IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus has reviewed the economic program
that Brazil is proposing to the fund, the officials said.
Brazilian Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello then is
expected to sign a letter to the fund setting out the
program, and the IMF in turn would ratify an agreement with
that country, including substantial loans. Ms. Cardoso said
yesterday she hoped to sign the letter of intent by the end
of the week.

   The negotiations with the IMF come at a time of growing
speculation in Brazil that the government will soon unveil a
new temporary wage-and-price freeze to avoid a resurgence of
inflation and a deepening of an incipient recession touched
off by the tough anti-inflation plan enforced by President
Fernando Collor de Mello in March. Mr. Collor has recently
suggested that employers and unions join together in a pact
to keep wages and prices under control.
   Brazil's IMF quota -- the reserves it subscribes to the
fund as a member of the agency -- totals just over $2
billion. Under IMF rules, as part of a so-called standby
agreement, Brazil can borrow between 40% and 90% of this
amount, or between $800 million and $1.8 billion. Brazil is
widely expected to borrow about $1.5 billion from the IMF.
   Standby agreements are meant to help IMF member nations
through temporary balance-of-payments difficulties. Brazil's
last standby agreement, which expired at the end of February
after 18 months, totaled about $1.3 billion at then
prevailing exchange rates.
   The amount of money Brazil can borrow from the IMF is
critical to its coming talks with commercial bank creditors.
The more IMF cash available, the less money recalcitrant
commercial banks will have to provide. Brazil is expected to
start negotiating with its main commercial bank creditors
this fall, probably in October, after it completes
negotiations with its foreign government creditors.
   The commercial bank talks are expected to be difficult,
particularly because of the substantial interest-payment
arrears Brazil has built up on its $70 billion of
medium-term, foreign commercial-bank debt. Those arrears,
which have been accumulating since July of last year, are
estimated to total $8 billion. Altogether, Brazil has about
$114 billion of gross foreign obligations.
   An IMF team just returned to Washington from Brazil.
According to wire service reports, Thomas Reichmann, who led
the IMF group, said in Brazil that he is "satisfied and
impressed" with the government's current economic program,
which includes "important and radical measures" that have "a
good chance of succeeding."
   President Collor's anti-inflation plan includes an
18-month freeze on about half the money circulating in the
Brazilian economy, elimination of subsidies, tight monetary
policies and reduced trade barriers.
