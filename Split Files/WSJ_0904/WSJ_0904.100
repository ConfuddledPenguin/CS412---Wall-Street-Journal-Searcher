   WASHINGTON -- President Bush plans an intensive campaign
to shore up support in the Soviet Union, Western Europe, Asia
and America's own Congress for the international campaign
against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The first step is likely to come today or tomorrow, when
the administration expects to announce a plan to forgive much
of Egypt's nearly $7 billion in military debts to the U.S.
Egypt has been America's most stalwart Arab ally in opposing
Iraq's invasion, and the debt relief is intended as a signal
that the U.S. is prepared to aid those in the Arab world who
endure economic pain by abiding by the trade ban against
Iraq.

   The second step will come at the end of the week, when Mr.
Bush heads for Finland for a one-day summit meeting Sunday
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Though the meeting also
will deal with conventional-arms negotiations, the key
American objective will be to solidify Soviet participation
in the international campaign against Iraq.
   Such moves to strengthen the anti-Iraq alliance are
important because it seems increasingly likely that Mr. Bush
is headed for a lengthy test of wills with Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein. And for the moment, that means the Persian
Gulf crisis is as much a test of America's diplomatic skills
as its military strength.
   Weekend talks between United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
failed to make any progress toward dislodging Iraq from
Kuwait. The only sign of a waver in Iraqi resolve was its
decision to allow several hundred foreigners to leave in the
past few days.
   The State Department said this included 47 Americans, who
landed at Dulles International Airport outside Washington
this weekend. The department also said 59 Americans were
among another group that arrived in Frankfurt, West Germany,
early Sunday morning and remained there overnight before
beginning to make their way back to the U.S. In a statement
over the weekend, the department said: "We understand that
the departure of several individuals was facilitated by the
Rev. Jesse Jackson."
   Yesterday, Baghdad balked at allowing more airlifts of
foreigners, and told nations with citizens trapped in Iraq to
send them food, the Associated Press reported. Separately,
the official Iraqi News agency reported that Iraq had
suspended repaying its foreign debt, which is estimated at
$30 billion to $35 billion. Most of the money is owed to the
U.S., Britain, France, the Soviet Union, West Germany and
Japan.
   Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who acknowledged that he hadn't made
any progress in his talks, specifically pointed to the
Bush-Gorbachev meeting as the next event that could produce
progress toward a diplomatic settlement of the international
showdown with Iraq. But U.S. officials are playing down such
suggestions, and the meeting seems more likely to be an
occasion for coordinating superpower pressure on Baghdad than
one for discussing diplomatic solutions.
   Mr. Bush is making it clear that he won't seek for the
Soviets to act as mediators between the U.S. and Iraq. "I
don't see a mediating role at all, and I don't think the
Soviets see themselves having a mediating role," Mr. Bush
told reporters before returning to Washington from a long
Labor Day weekend at his Maine vacation home. "There are a
lot of mediators out there trying hard, Secretary-General de
Cuellar being in the forefront of this." Mr. Bush also said
that Yemen appears interested in trying to mediate the
dispute with Iraq, but the president again expressed little
optimism that diplomatic contact can change Iraqi behavior.
   The Soviet Union traditionally has been Iraq's most
important military ally, and the Kremlin's quick and
unequivocal condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was
instrumental in allowing clear United Nations penalties
against Iraq.
   But in recent days, there have been hints that Soviet
enthusiasm is flagging. Perhaps most importantly, Soviet
military officials are beginning to question why the Kremlin
seems to be endorsing a big American military buildup in
Saudi Arabia, just a few hundred miles from the Soviet
border.
   So it may be important to hold a superpower summit now so
that Mr. Bush can directly tell Soviet leaders that, while
the U.S. would like to leave behind some kind of military
presence in Saudi Arabia when the Iraq crisis ends, the
current buildup of tens of thousands of soldiers is
temporary.
   It also will become increasingly important that the
Soviets continue the embargo on arms supplies to Iraq that
they imposed immediately after the invasion. The U.S. would
like to be sure that the Iraqis don't get the spare parts and
supplies necessary to keep more than 100,000 soldiers on duty
in a sustained occupation of Kuwait, where they must fight
sporadic battles against bands of Kuwaiti resistance
fighters.
   Mr. Bush also may want to get the Soviets to withdraw
their military advisers from Iraq. The Kremlin says those
advisers are staying only because they are under contract,
and Soviet officials imply that they are reluctant to call
the advisers home out of fear of reprisals against Soviet
citizens in Iraq and Kuwait.
   At the same time, the U.S. will be trying to illustrate
that financial compensation will flow from the international
community to nations that suffer from complying with the
trade embargo against Iraq. The U.S. is in a position to give
the most important possible economic relief to one hard-hit
country, Egypt, by forgiving that nation's increasingly
onerous burden of debts to the U.S.
   Egypt's military and civilian indebtedness to the U.S.
totals some $12 billion, and it is $1.2 billion to $1.5
billion behind in its repayments. The military portion of
that debt totals about $6.7 billion, administration officials
say, and the State Department already had scheduled meetings
to discuss debt relief even before the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
   Mr. Bush can't forgive the debt himself, but he intends to
ask Congress to agree to do so. The president will have to
overcome longstanding congressional resistance to debt
forgiveness.
   For one thing, despite general gratitude for Egypt's role
in opposing Iraq, there will be worries about what the
effects of forgiving such a large chunk of debt will be on
the federal deficit. The Bush administration is contemplating
ways to finesse the deficit problem and still forgive the
debt. For instance, the U.S. might use an accounting gimmick
to reduce the budget impact of debt forgiveness, pegging the
value of the Egyptian loans at so-called current-market value
rather than their face value. Since economically strapped
Egypt doesn't appear to be in any shape to pay off its debt
now, the market value of the loans could be counted as
billions less than the face value.
   Beyond the budget impact, Congress has been leery of
forgiving debts because doing so might open the floodgates
for other countries, and domestic lobbies such as farmers, to
demand similar relief. In particular, Israel would demand
similar benefits from the U.S.
   Most of Egypt's military debts to the U.S. date from 1979
to 1983, the years immediately after the Camp David peace
treaties, when the U.S. carefully maintained symmetry in aid
to Egypt and Israel as part of an informal understanding.
After 1983, military aid was switched from loans to grants.
   Israel's supporters will argue that writing off Egypt's
debt and not Israel's debt would represent the first
asymmetry in dealing with the Camp David partners --
something pro-Israel forces will fight vigorously. "If
there's going to be debt relief for Egypt, you can be sure
that friends of Israel will make a top priority out of
getting forgiveness for Israel's debt, too," said one
pro-Israel activist. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will
be coming to Washington Wednesday for talks with Secretary of
State James Baker, and the debt issue is sure to be high on
the agenda.
   As the U.S. moves to help Egypt, a show of support from
American friends such as West Germany, Italy and Japan is
important if Mr. Bush is to continue persuading Americans
that the campaign against Iraq remains an international
rather than an American effort. In addition to Egypt,
administration officials want such allies to give economic
aid to Turkey and Jordan to repay them for the economic
hardships they will endure for abiding by the international
trade ban against Iraq. And the U.S. wants more material
support for the American, Arab and European military forces
massing around Iraq.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady will leave early this
week for a trip to Asia to try to persuade Japan, South Korea
and Singapore to do more. And Mr. Baker leaves for a similar
mission to Western Europe and the oil-rich Gulf states later
in the week.
