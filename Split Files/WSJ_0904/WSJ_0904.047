   CARTAGENA, Spain -- Juan Jose Romera-Rodriguez watches
worriedly as his youngest son, Francisco, and 135 other
Spanish sailors climb aboard the corvette Descubierta, bound
for the Persian Gulf.
   Around him on the dock, Spain's mixed emotions about the
maneuver are clearly apparent. A chorus of protesters, 200
strong, begins a rhythmic chant: "Spanish soldiers are not
for war]" Other bystanders climb surrounding walls and try to
drown out the protests with cheers.

   Despite the popular ambivalence about whether to send
troops to the Gulf, the Spanish government has left little
doubt about why it decided to do so. The nation's forces are
going to the Middle East not for Spain, not for the U.S. and
not even for cheaper oil. Rather, Spain has justified the
mission -- its first major foreign military effort since the
Spanish-American War nearly a century ago -- by maintaining
that it fulfills a commitment to a united Europe.
   "We're members of the {European} Community now," explains
Mr. Romera-Rodriguez, wiping the sweat from his sunburned
forehead. "We have to stand together."
   To some, the EC's efforts in the Middle East show how
Europeans collectively can play a more visible political role
in global affairs, and not just a greater economic one.
Pierre Champenois, head of the political-military affairs
department in the Belgian Foreign Ministry, asserts that "a
European framework {for political and defense matters} is
taking shape."
   At the same time, however, the EC's response is also
highlighting just how far the group's 12 member states still
have to go if they are to achieve their oft-stated goal of
political unification. "Each country in Europe has reacted to
this crisis in ways that are typical for the way they have
behaved for the past 100 years or so," says Bill Cash,
chairman of the British Parliament's backbench committee on
European affairs and an outspoken opponent of EC political
union. Placing self-interest above the interests of the
group, he says, the EC nations have been "absolutely true to
form."
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, too, has argued
that the crisis shows how talk about a common security policy
as part of EC political union is little more than "rhetoric."
Only France and Britain have done more than the bare minimum,
she said, adding, "It is sad that, at this critical time,
Europe has not fully measured up to expectations."
   Speaking on behalf of the EC's Council of Ministers, over
which Italy is presiding for the rest of the year, Italian
Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis called Mrs. Thatcher's
remarks "unjustified and ungenerous" and insisted that the EC
has acted "effectively and with clarity of intentions and
decisions." While he said that the EC wouldn't as a group
respond positively to President Bush's request for help in
paying for U.S. forces in the Gulf, he noted that the
community could assume a larger role in aiding such nations
as Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, which have been hit hard
economically by the crisis.
   In many ways, progress on the post-1992 single market and
the coming talks about a more unified political structure and
single EC currency have raised public expectations far beyond
the community's ability to deliver. The EC's 12 small armies
are still designed more to protect their countries from one
another or from the Soviets than to project Europe's
collective power and influence in the world. And even though
the EC has stepped up efforts to coordinate its members'
political positions toward Iraq, the cumbersome process
hasn't been able to match the speed and clarity of statements
and actions by individual members or by the U.S.
   Indeed, most EC specialists on the Continent, as well as
several other national leaders, say they see the stumbling
over Iraq merely as further proof that a stronger political
structure is needed. They note that in such areas as trade
and commerce, concerted efforts by the 12 member states have
already made the EC a major world player.
   "It's clear that we must go further" toward a common EC
defense and security policy, Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens was quoted as saying in an interview published
Saturday in La Libre Belgique, a Belgian newspaper.
   As things stand, the EC's ability to play a major role in
such fast-moving international events as the Gulf crisis is
made nearly impossible by the maddening complexity of its
institutions. Under the Treaty of Rome, the EC's main
charter, military matters can't even be discussed. Such
issues can be broached only within the Western European
Union, which was created by a treaty in 1955 and which groups
only nine of the nations in a defense pact.
   More recent attempts to bring a narrower range of military
and security matters under the authority of the EC itself, as
were made during the 1986 revision of the Treaty of Rome,
have been blocked by the neutral Irish. In situations like
the Middle East crisis, the result is a merry-go-round of
meetings in which the WEU and EC separately hash out
interrelated parts of the same problem.
   Not surprisingly, it took the WEU nearly three weeks to
decide to send a joint naval mission to the Gulf, partly
because many of the ministers who had to meet were either on
vacation or had to attend to duties at the national level.
Similarly, a week after the U.S. moved to expel part of
Iraq's diplomatic mission in Washington, EC diplomats still
haven't taken a definite stand of their own.
   Because of their limited deployments in the Gulf, EC
countries will have only limited influence in the way the
crisis unfolds. Defense specialists say that European forces
will in general still depend on the U.S. to be in charge of
overall coordination if fighting begins.
   This probably also means that the U.S. would do most of
the fighting, if it comes to that. The massive French
aircraft carrier Clemenceau, for example, which is now in the
Indian Ocean and heading for the Gulf, doesn't even have
attack aircraft on board. While it is equipped with 42
helicopters, the fighting ship has been converted for this
mission into a massive supply ship and operations base. West
Germany, meanwhile, says it can't take part in the
U.N.-backed blockade of Iraq without a constitutional change.
   And although Britain has been one of the nations most
deeply involved in the Gulf force, even it has been reluctant
to supply significant ground troops. Last week, Britain said
it was sending another destroyer and three minesweepers to
complement the three-ship fleet and three dozen or so fighter
aircraft it already has in the region. But experts say the
force is still relatively small.
   Military preparedness hasn't been an EC priority in recent
years. Between 1988 and 1989, EC nations' defense spending
didn't grow at all, remaining at about $131 billion at a time
when the costs of replacing and maintaining equipment and
personnel were skyrocketing, according to figures compiled by
the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   The Continental nations argue that the European public
would be more willing to support a unified EC military, which
could actually have some influence in the world, than 12 tiny
armies that don't add up to much. An EC defense structure may
soon be the only way to keep any army in many EC countries,
says Belgium's Mr. Champenois. "If we keep going the way we
are going nationally," he contends, "we will end up with no
defense."
   But that idea has its own set of problems, France being
one of them. Although a supporter of EC political
integration, France has so far been unwilling to include
defense in the discussions. Former French President Charles
De Gaulle, who pulled France out of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's integrated command in 1966, is still a sacred
figure in French defense circles. French resistance to losing
the independence he nurtured -- especially with respect to
France's nuclear force -- has brought to a halt most serious
discussions about EC defense.
   Despite such hurdles, most experts believe that the Gulf
crisis will prove a watershed in forcing Europe to think more
clearly about the role it wants to play in the world. Says
Don Kerr, a defense specialist at the International Institute
for Strategic Studies: "The U.S.'s position as the country
which has to send forces all over the globe is getting to be
a good deal less comfortable" for Washington, mainly because
of the cost of such missions.
