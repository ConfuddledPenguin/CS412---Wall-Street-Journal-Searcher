   Even as the school-choice revolution gains force across
the nation, the education establishment is asserting its
power in the battle for public funds. This lobby has emerged
clearly as the No. 1 adversary of the American taxpayer.
   Nowhere is this more clear than in California. Thanks to a
1988 ballot-initiative, the state constitution now sets aside
better than 40% of tax dollars for the schools. Each year's
expenditures become a formal base for the following year's
increase. This is mostly regardless of fiscal emergencies or
economic hardship. Result: As California schools get more
money per pupil than ever and as its teachers rank behind
only Alaska's in pay, other programs (and taxpayers) get
squeezed.

   Gov. George Deukmejian has battled the education cartel
and its leader, State Superintendent Bill Honig, for nearly
eight years. In signing his last budget as chief executive,
Mr. Deukmejian did what he could, blue-penciling millions of
dollars from Mr. Honig's departmental budget. The schoolman
is pushing to override the line-item vetoes.
   Public education's managers have had a good political ride
of it. Despite increased difficulty in recent decades in
getting local school-tax measures passed, they have found
statewide elections more to their liking. As with the 1988
item in California, the costs can be better hidden or shifted
onto somebody else. Arizona and Nevada have such measures on
the ballot this November. It took a determined Michigan
Chamber of Commerce to defeat special school taxes there last
year.
   Washington state may be headed for a similar vote.
Teachers there last month picketed the governor, wanting a
raise in their average $33,000 nine-month pay instead of the
performance-based compensation he favors. The head of the
state teachers' union suggested curbing business-tax
deductions to spring for the boost.
   Sustained teacher walkouts, such as in West Virginia and
Oklahoma the past year, achieved their aim. And with teacher
salaries having declined to about 40% of U.S. school
operating budgets, griping about central-office bureaucracy
surely is merited.
   The truth always is that some teachers aren't paid nearly
enough, whereas others are overpaid with their first dollar.
Parental-choice mechanisms help to distinguish between them,
and between administrators. But unions prefer
across-the-board raises. And state legislatures can be soft
touches for the schools, because Republicans from
middle-class districts are as eager to wangle funds as the
Democrats from central cities, whose classrooms are allowed
to get worse no matter how much is spent. (The bout of
redistributionist "equalization" now gripping New Jersey is
the latest of such court-aided efforts to make dollar signs
the focal point of saving schools in poorer areas.)
   The National Education Association, the big teachers'
union, last month asked for a $2.2 billion Operation Jump
Start program by which a third of the country's
elementary-grade students would begin their school terms two
weeks early to play catch up. Somehow this is supposed to
compensate for the lapses in instruction and parenting from
which they suffer the rest of the year. The NEA also said the
public schools should be the primary provider of day care,
meals and health-screening for preschool, kindergarten and
elementary pupils. Potty training, too, probably, as the
teachers' unions strive for more market share of available
tax dollars at all levels of government.
   It's not all offense for the school spenders these days.
Increasingly, as in California, they must defend their take
against those who would limit the public sector. In Oregon, a
firefight has broken out over a property-tax limit to be
decided in November. (The state branch of the NEA is
especially besieged because an educationalchoice measure is
on the same ballot.) Around the country in this active year
of citizen tax resistance, it's the same thing. John Keast,
who tracks such matters for the Free Congress Foundation,
reports that in every state considering a spending or tax
limit, the school lobby is the primary foe of these control
efforts.
   True enough, schools have had more burdens imposed on them
by a deterioration in home life, and some of them (including
those in Mr. Honig's California, to be fair) have managed to
raise test scores in the past few years. Overall, however,
the nation has paid dearly only to remain at risk of
educational implosion. Money won't help without some kind of
market to allocate it, without more competition to weed out
failed administrators and teachers, and without more
accountability to the people who have to pay the taxes.
