   LONDON -- London's freight futures market is pointing to a
sharp slowdown in shipping trade in the coming year, dealers
say.
   As autumn nears, futures prices normally trade at a wide
premium to the index of freight rates, says Matthew Frank, a
trader at GNI Freight Futures Ltd. This year, however,
futures contracts over the next nine months are level with
the spot index of 1208 points, he says, while the contract
for next July is at a discount of 10%.

   "The futures market reflects the consensus of the shipping
trade," an executive of an Oslo shipping company says.
"Demand for cargoes is waning, while the supply of ships is
rising at a rapid rate. As a result, the market expects
freight rates to decline."
   London's Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange
accounts for only a tiny proportion of the shipping market,
dealers say, but it is used by the trade as a guide to the
future. The market trades contracts based on an index of
important dry cargo shipping rates covering 14 shipping
routes. Grain accounts for about 60% of the index's
weighting, followed by iron ore and steel at 18%. The
remainder of the index is allocated to coal and phosphates.
   Gloomy forecasts by futures traders and shipping brokers
contrast with the smart 12% rally in the index of freight
rates since the beginning of July. The market became
depressed when expected grain orders from the Soviet Union
and China failed to materialize, Mr. Frank of GNI says.
   Having begun to appreciate from their July lows, freight
futures prices jumped when Iraq invaded Kuwait, he says.
Shipowners raised freight rates to compensate for the surge
in bunker fuel prices, Mr. Frank says, and international
grain traders, taking advantage of low corn, wheat and barley
prices, bought cargoes for shipment.
   Yet it is highly unlikely that shipowners will maintain
freight rates, ship brokers say.
   Despite the rally in the past two months, the Baltic
Freight index is down 31% from its all time high of 1750
points in May 1989. The decline almost matches freight rates
of a ship carrying 55,000 metric tons of grain from the Gulf
of Mexico to Ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, which
have fallen to $11 a metric ton from $15 a ton last year.
Meanwhile, ships ranging from 25,000 metric tons to more than
100,000 tons lowered their charges this year, says Peter
Kerr-Dineen, a director of Howe Robinson Shipbrokers.
   The freight index was buoyant in 1988 and 1989 because of
huge Soviet orders for grain, a growing world economy and
fewer new ships, Mr. Kerr-Dineen says.
   In the coming 12 months, however, the Soviet Union, China
and India are unlikely to import vast quantities of grain, he
says. And a slowdown in production of steel and other bulk
commodities will help reduce the flow of cargoes across the
oceans, he says.
   While demand is falling, supply has increased. The revival
in trade between 1987 to 1989 encouraged shipowners to build
more ships, and fewer of the older vessels are being
scrapped, brokers say.
   As a result, ships equivalent to 67 millions tons
deadweight were on order by the first quarter this year,
compared with 33 million tons deadweight at the end of 1987,
says Robert Garner, a joint managing director of Eggar
Forrester Ltd., London ship brokers.
   At the end of June there were orders for 398 ships,
including oil, bulk cargo and combination carriers, he says.
This quantity was much larger than in previous years.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf will aggravate the
situation, Mr. Garner says. The Iraqi trade blockade and
mines in the Persian Gulf will force large "combination
ships," which can transport either oil or dry cargoes, to
compete for grain, iron ore or coal business, he says. As a
result other shipowners will lower freight rates, Mr. Garner
predicts.
   "Nevertheless," says Philip Rogers, head of research at
Simpson, Spence &amp; Young, London ship brokers, "I don't
foresee a collapse of the freight market. But shipping trade
is likely to be flat next year."
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Gold
                                                                                                       

   Gold turned quiet around midweek as tensions cooled a bit
in the Persian Gulf, and eased Friday -- a trend analysts say
may continue.
   One analyst says the Mideast crisis remains the major
factor in gold, but the dollar appears to be having a renewed
influence.
   "Historically, the dollar has had a greater impact on gold
when it is strong than when it weakens," the analyst says,
"so the easiness of gold may be forecasting a stronger
dollar."
   Significantly, he says, the lower trend in gold is taking
place when prices for crude oil and products are strong and
generating an inflationary climate.
   A negative for precious metals in general, he says, is
that there is very little investor demand for gold, even less
for platinum and practically none for silver.
   Another analyst, Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for
Chase Manhattan Bank, says the market at the moment was
"anticipating peace" but that overall it "remains
event-driven."
   Craig Sloane, precious metals analyst for Smith Barney,
says the market at the weekend was "sort of haphazard and
giving no real signs of what is in store" this week.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   This week traders will watch for any sign that wheat
prices can find strength after the value of some contracts
dropped about 8% last week.
   Wheat prices are sinking amid forecasts that large
harvests in the Soviet Union might trim its demand for U.S.
crops. At the same time, other countries, such as India, are
dealing with good-sized crops. According to traders, India
might export one million metric tons of wheat. It usually
isn't such a large supplier.
   "The world is awash in wheat," says Victor Lespinasse,
assistant vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.
   Traders will also continue to watch the military crisis in
the Persian Gulf. If oil prices climb sharply this week,
grain prices would tend to follow suit on speculation that
some oil-producing nations might use their higher revenues to
buy more U.S. grain.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices plunged a half cent a pound Friday on a
reported world market sale of sugar by Brazil. Traders
departed for the long holiday weekend wondering if further
sales were in store this week.
   According to one analyst, Brazil was reported to have sold
as much as 170,000 tons of refined sugar to international
trade houses. "It caught the market by surprise because no
one expected export sales so soon in the new season that
began June 1," the analyst says.
   The sales raise questions as to how much more sugar Brazil
may have for sale, the analyst says. Due to high oil prices,
Brazil had been expected to divert more cane to alcohol and
withhold sugar stocks in case they were needed for internal
consumption, either as alcohol or sugar, she says.
