   ST. LOUIS, Mo. -- Apex Oil Co. emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings, significantly smaller than when it
filed for protection from creditors on Christmas Eve, 1987.
   The closely held concern grew from a tiny oil-trading and
transportation operation to become, partly through its highly
leveraged 1981 acquisition of Clark Oil &amp; Refining Co., a
petroleum conglomerate with annual revenue of about $13
billion.

   But after the company had big losses in oil futures
trading, and the value of its oil inventory tumbled because
of the petroleum market's mid-decade slump, Apex's lenders
pulled the plug on vital loan agreements.
   Apex cleared its debts with secured lenders in full in
1988, by selling its Clark Oil unit to a partnership composed
of Horsham Corp., Toronto, and Apex owners Paul A. Novelly
and Samuel R. Goldstein.
   Under the court-approved reorganization, Messrs. Goldstein
and Novelly will together lend $15 million to Apex. Banque
Indosuez of Geneva and Banque Paribas of New York each loaned
Apex $15 million in the reorganization.
   Apex's unsecured holders will receive as much as $20
million in cash, $20 million in seven-year notes secured by
Apex assets to be sold over two years, and $20 million in
10-year notes secured by a portion of anticipated profits
from Clark Oil Trading Co. Clark Oil Trading, owned by
Messrs. Novelly &amp; Goldstein, isn't associated with the bigger
Clark Oil &amp; Refining unit that was sold, nor did it ever come
under Chapter 11 protection.
   The settlement with unsecured debtholders represents
payment of 64 cents to 86 cents on the dollar.
   Apex, which said it operated profitably throughout the
Chapter 11 period, now plans to focus on its oil trading, oil
terminal and shipping operations.
