   Will Yield 226,000 More Barrels a Day

   WASHINGTON -- Increased oil production in Alaska will soon
yield an additional 226,000 barrels a day -- far more than
had been anticipated -- to help offset the losses of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti crude, the Energy Department said.
   Two weeks ago, the department predicted the additional
production could soon increase output 50,000 barrels a day,
and as many as 140,000 barrels a day in six months. A
department spokesman said oil companies operating in Alaska
have increased their estimate of additional amounts that can
be produced.

   The Alaskan output, along with increased output from Texas
and from the Naval Petroleum Reserve, will give the nation an
additional 251,000 to 261,000 barrels a day in the fourth
quarter. That brings output close to the department's goal of
boosting domestic production 270,000 to 320,000 barrels by
year end.
   The new estimates from Alaska, however, come as the
department said that a sizable chunk of output it had
expected to be available by year end won't be available until
late spring at the earliest. In an interview, Stephen
Wakefield, the department's general counsel, said he was
being "fairly optimistic" in predicting that the Port
Arguello project off the California coast could start pumping
25,000 barrels a day by late spring or early summer.
   That assessment is gloomier than the one offered by Energy
Secretary James Watkins last month, when the department
announced plans to mediate an environmental dispute that is
holding up the production.
   Mr. Watkins said then he hoped three offshore oil
platforms could be producing 75,000 barrels a day by year
end. Mr. Wakefield, however, said a visit to California had
given him a greater "sense of realism" about the project,
which is caught up in a controversy over whether tankers or
pipelines should move the oil to refineries 130 miles down
the coast. Bringing production to as much as 75,000 to 90,000
barrels a day would take several more months, he said.
   Mr. Wakefield also said the loss of Kuwaiti imports and
the different mix of crude shipments to the U.S. since the
Iraqi invasion is making it tough for domestic refiners to
meet the nation's needs for jet fuel and other refined
products. He said the U.S. has lost a significant amount of
such products from Kuwait at the same time that the military
airlift to Saudi Arabia has required great quantities of jet
fuel.
   In addition, much of the additional crude that Venezuela
is providing to offset the loss of Kuwaiti shipments is
so-called heavy crude, which many U.S. refiners can't use.
Oil industry executives and oil markets have grown
increasingly concerned about tight supplies of refined
products.
   On another matter, Mr. Wakefield said a tax credit to
encourage efforts to recover hard-to-get oil from existing
fields is "high on our list of things to consider. We're
looking carefully at it." He said the White House economic
policy council will be considering various conservation and
production-enhancement measures this week.
   He said the department is also "looking into encouraging"
the Forest Service to speed up its consideration of proposed
pipeline projects that would bring natural gas into
California to use in projects designed to recover hard-to-get
oil. He also said it would be helpful if the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission could make a decision as soon as
possible on the proposed Iroquois gas pipeline. That pipeline
is supposed bring Canadian natural gas to the northeast U.S.
