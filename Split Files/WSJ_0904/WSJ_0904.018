   MONTREAL -- Ivaco Inc., a steel products concern, said it
definitively agreed to sell its two Niagara Lockport
Industries units, which make specialty fabrics for the
paper-making industry at five plants in the U.S. and Canada,
to BTR PLC of Britain for 85 million Canadian dollars (US$74
million).
   BTR also will assume Niagara Lockport debt of about C$45
million. Ivaco said closing of the sale is conditioned on
obtaining the approval of Canadian competition authorities by
Nov. 30. Ivaco said the sale has already been approved by
U.S. antitrust authorities.
