   Poynter Institute, the St. Petersburg, Fla., nonprofit
foundation that owns a majority stake of Times Publishing
Co., reassured Florida Attorney General Robert A. Butterworth
that its finances can withstand Times Publishing's secret
stock agreement with an investor group including Texas
billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Mr. Butterworth, in a letter to the institute last week,
threatened to take the foundation to court to learn more
about the Times-Bass agreement, which was ostensibly struck
to ensure the publishing company's independence.

   Mr. Butterworth, whom the Poynter Institute had previously
asked for help in fending off Mr. Bass, wrote that he was
concerned "that the fiscal integrity of a charitable
educational institute is now in jeopardy."
   In responding to Mr. Butterworth's query, Robert J.
Haiman, the institute's president and managing director, said
that as part of the stock agreement, Poynter is exchanging
300 shares of Times Publishing preferred stock for a $30
million subordinated debenture. The 13% debenture, due 2002,
will yield more income than Poynter received from the
preferred shares, he wrote.
