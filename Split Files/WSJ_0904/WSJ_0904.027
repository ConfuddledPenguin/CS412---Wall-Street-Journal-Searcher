   As a commercial real-estate broker specializing in tenant
representation, I was interested in "To Buy or Not to Buy" in
your Real Estate report (special section, Aug. 10).
   But why use the example of a $300,000 house renting for
$1,500 a month when such a case rarely occurs in real life?
It rarely occurs because most people do not rent houses at
less than the cost of ownership, or even debt service. In
this flawed example, a 25% equity in this $300,000 house with
a 10% 30-year mortgage would create a monthly payment of
$1,975. Setting rent at $1,500 a month yields a monthly cash
flow of minus $475. Not to mention wounded hot-water heaters,
taxes, insurance and loss of interest on the $75,000 equity.

   If home buyers truly looked at the investment side of home
ownership, their profit expectations would probably have
sobered over the past couple of years. The reality is home
ownership provides a sense of achievement and status, much
like a "signature office building" for a business owner. The
pride of ownership far exceeds the economic argument. But
unlike quality homes, there is an expanding, long-term supply
of commercial buildings across the country keeping rental
rates in check and tenant-flavored options available.

   Your Real Estate report was irresponsible. To compare the
price of a single-family house in Princeton, N.J., to the
average pay of a factory worker is akin to comparing the
price of a Rolls-Royce to the salary of an average worker.
The areas discussed are predominantly upper-class
neighborhoods that have always been beyond the reach of the
average factory worker.
   Second, your recommendation that renting is preferable to
purchasing is both erroneous and damaging to a large majority
of your readership. While it is true that people located in
an area for only a few years may benefit from renting, it is
also true that there is no 10-year period in recent history
that does not demonstrate clearly the financial value of
ownership. Because of the tax benefits and equity buildup of
ownership, it is nearly a necessity for Americans to purchase
real estate in order to accumulate any substantial net worth.
   Third, while real-estate values have no doubt declined in
recent months in the Northeast there is no reason to believe
that these declines are a long-term trend. The Northeast
remains a center of economic development; history proves that
real estate always proves a secure investment in the long
run. Like any other investment instrument the real-estate
market is subject to corrections and downswings; to label
these corrections as the end of real estate as an investment
vehicle is as senseless as dismantling the stock market after
Black Monday.
   As a realtor and mortgage banker I am constantly
frustrated by the fact that much of our real estate is sold
to foreigners who are intelligent enough to have the
foresight to ignore doom sayers such as yourselves. If there
is any American who doubts the wisdom of owning property, let
him ask his parents where they would be today had they not
purchased their own home.
