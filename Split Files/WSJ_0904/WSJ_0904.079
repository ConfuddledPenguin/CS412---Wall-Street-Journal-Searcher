   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp., following the lead
of General Motors Corp. is offering rebates on most of its
1991 model cars and trucks before the model year begins.
   Chrysler said it will offer rebates of as much as $1,000
on most 1991 car and truck models, but not on its restyled
minivans and certain other models.

   GM said last month that it was offering discounts of as
much as $1,250 on some of its 1991-model cars now arriving in
showrooms. The 1991 model year begins Oct. 1.
   Ford Motor Co. hasn't matched GM's and Chrysler's offers.
But Ford is likely to follow suit, possibly as soon as today.
   Chrysler officials said last month they wanted to reduce
their reliance on rebates as a marketing tool. But with the
outlook for fall sales already uncertain in the face of a
softening U.S. economy, Chrysler had little choice but to
match GM's offers. The No. 3 auto maker's share of the car
market fell sharply in the first seven months of this year to
8.8% from 10.4%.
   Chrysler said it's offering $500 rebates on 19 models,
including the Chrysler Imperial, Plymouth Acclaim and
Sundance, Dodge Daytona and Spirit and Jeep Comanche.
Chrysler set rebates of $1,000 on its Dodge Ramcharger and
Jeep Grand Wagoneer.
