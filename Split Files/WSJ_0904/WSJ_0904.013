   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. plans to extend its
corporate cost-cutting campaign until June 30 and raise the
goal to $2.5 billion -- $1 billion higher than previously
disclosed.
   The struggling auto maker needs the cost cuts to cope with
a surge in buyer-incentive costs to an industry average of
about $1,250 a vehicle, up from just $500 a vehicle two years
ago, said Lee A. Iacocca, the company's chairman. "If we can
get to $2.5 billion, I'll give our guys a lot of credit," he
said. "The last $1 billion obviously gets a little harder."

   In an interview, Mr. Iacocca said that, had his travel
schedule been slightly different, he might have been caught
in the midst of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He had been
scheduled to depart Nov. 1 on a trip to Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia to visit new distributors of Chrysler products. The
trip was canceled after the invasion.
   The executive also made the following points:
   -- Chrysler is committed to maintaining its common-stock
dividend, currently 30 cents a share quarterly. At the
current price of $13.875 a share the stock's dividend yield
is 8.6%, and Chrysler's cumulative earnings during the past
three quarters haven't been enough to cover the payout. "But
all good companies go through some periods where they don't
earn the dividend but continue to pay it," Mr. Iacocca said.
   -- The departure in May of Gerald Greenwald as Chrysler's
vice chairman was "a bit of an emotional jolt for me" because
he had selected Mr. Greenwald to succeed him one day. The top
two contenders now are vice chairman R.S. Miller, 48 years
old, and Robert A. Lutz, the 58-year-old president of
Chrysler Motors. "I'll watch the two of them for the next 12
months and make a decision," Mr. Iacocca said, adding,
however, that he won't retire "until things are squared away"
at Chrysler.
   -- Chrysler hopes to find "a good European partner" to
cooperate on vehicle development and distribution, and is
currently talking with several companies, including Italy's
Fiat S.p.A. "Will anything come of those?" he asked. "Nothing
yet. Will it be a big deal? I would think it will start with
things like minivans and Jeeps, our strengths." It's less
likely, Mr. Iacocca added, that a foreign auto maker would
buy a big equity stake in Chrysler, because Chrysler doesn't
currently need a cash infusion and prospective buyers are
wary. "It's the old story," he said. "They want to wait and
see how well you're doing."
   Mr. Iacocca portrayed his cost-cutting effort as crucial
to returning Chrysler to healthy profitability. The company
already is close to reaching its initial goal of cutting $1.5
billion from its cost base, he said, since the program began
last July.
   Without those cuts, he added, Chrysler would be running in
the red right now. The company's first-half earnings plunged
64% from a year ago, to $251 million on sales of $16.5
billion.
   If Chrysler's cost cuts can reach $2.5 billion, Mr.
Iacocca explained, the company should weather the next two
years without eating into its $4.5 billion of cash on hand.
By then, Chrysler will be launching a crucial line of
mid-sized cars code-named LH.
   But the wild card, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged, is if car and
truck sales take an unexpectedly steep plunge in the months
ahead, perhaps because of the Persian Gulf crisis. In that
case, he said, "the worst I think will happen is we'll run
through $750 million in cash in each of the next two years.
I'll blow a full $1.5 billion, but I'll still have $3 billion
to run on without any sweat at night."
   Chrysler's cost-cutting methods have included a broad
range of actions, from layoffs and company-travel
restrictions to eliminating most company-paid newspapers and
magazine subscriptions. The company also eliminated merit
raises for salaried employees and bonuses for eligible
executives.
   Some of the measures are being undone. Chrysler reinstated
merit raises a few months ago. And 1,800 senior employees
will receive stock awards to offset the loss of their bonus
pay, which can be one-third or more of an executive's total
compensation.
   Still, the stringency has taken its toll on morale. While
the resignations of Mr. Greenwald and a couple of other
high-level executives have received the most publicity, many
at Chrysler are more concerned about departures in
upper-middle management, where many operational
responsibilities lie.
   For example, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that several
engineers with expertise in the key area of tailpipe
emissions recently have left Chrysler for Ford Motor Co.
Another top engineer has returned to teaching, and a
high-level management-information specialist has left to join
Honeywell Inc.
   Also, Michael V. Howe, who as general manager of the
Chrysler-Plymouth division had a high-level marketing job,
recently left to run the Detroit office of Young &amp; Rubicam,
an advertising agency that handles the account of Ford's
Lincoln-Mercury division.
   Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that keeping morale up at
Chrysler has been "increasingly difficult" lately. But he was
philosophical about the recent departures. "The fact that you
lose some good guys isn't all bad," he said. "Because if your
guys were never looked at {by other companies}, you'd think,
`Gee, I thought I had such great guys, but nobody wants them
but me.'"
