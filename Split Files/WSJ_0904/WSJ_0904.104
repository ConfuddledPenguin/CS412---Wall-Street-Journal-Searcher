   Boeing Co. received a $6 billion order from Asiana
Airlines, a new South Korean carrier.
   Asiana placed firm orders for 27 Boeing aircraft valued at
about $3 billion and took options for 24 other planes, also
valued at about $3 billion. The Asiana order, which was
expected, is for six 747-400 passenger jets, three 747-400
freighters, 10 767-300 jets and eight 737-400 jets. The
planes are scheduled for delivery between 1993 and 1999.

   Separately, GPA Group Ltd. of Ireland, one of the world's
largest airliner-leasing companies, said it ordered as many
as 25 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 long-range aircraft, valued at
about $2.5 billion.
   McDonnell Douglas couldn't be reached for comment, but GPA
said the order comprises 13 firm orders and options on 12
more MD-11s, due for delivery between 1995 and 1999. Graham
Boyd, GPA's managing director for new aircraft acquisitions,
told reporters at the biennial Farnborough air show near
London that the company has no customers yet for the new
planes.
   Also at the show, NWA Inc. announced it had converted
options on 75 Airbus Industrie A-320 commercial jets into
firm orders and had taken new options on 30 A-321 aircraft in
a transaction valued at $4.6 billion. NWA, the
Minneapolis-based parent of Northwest Airlines, said it would
be operating 100 A-320s by 1995. It already has eight of the
150-seat short-haul to medium-haul airliners in operation.
Northwest said the new options for the A-321 were convertible
into A-320s before 1994 and were for delivery after 1996.
   Airbus, a consortium comprising Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.,
also announced at the air show that it may be profitable this
year, which would be a first in the consortium's 20-year
history. Managing Director Jean Pierson said "we might be in
the black" for 1990, on revenue of about $5 billion. He
declined to elaborate on the sum. Airbus had said it would
become profitable in 1994 or 1995.
   He said the consortium probably will receive 300 to 350
firm orders this year, down from last year's record 421
orders but above the 270 orders forecast earlier this year
for 1990.
   Asiana, South Korea's No. 2 airline, is moving quickly to
set up an international carrier network in the fast-growing
Asian region. Formed in 1988 by South Korean industrial
conglomerate Khumo Group, Asiana began by flying charter
services with leased jetliners. Emboldened by the
government's policy on airline deregulation, the carrier has
since moved into scheduled flights and began expanding
overseas last January. The Seoul-based company plans to
expand service to the U.S. in the fall of 1991, with other
routes through Asia. The company has grown so fast that it
had to lure pilots away from its well-established rival,
Korean Air, until Korean Air asked the government to ban the
practice. Asiana has a leased fleet of 10 Boeing 737-400s and
two 737-500s.
   Also at the airshow, British Airways PLC confirmed that it
has deferred decision on ordering new aircraft, partly
because of the Persian Gulf crisis. A spokeswoman for the
company, Britain's largest airline operator, said it was
originally due to announce around this time a decision on
replacing aging aircraft, primarily its fleet of eight
DC-10s.
