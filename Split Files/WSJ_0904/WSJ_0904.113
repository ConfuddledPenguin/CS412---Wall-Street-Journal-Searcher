   AB Skandia said first-half pretax profit plummeted 87% as
financial costs ballooned in the wake of a recent acquisition
spree and as a string of natural disasters in Sweden and
abroad caused heavy losses in underwriting operations.
   Scandinavia's biggest insurer didn't issue a full-year
profit forecast. But the Stockholm company's chief executive,
Bjoern Wolrath, was skeptical about chances of a rapid
turnaround. "It's going to take a while before big
investments we've been making in international expansion
begin to produce the profits we expect," he said.

   Skandia said pretax profit in the first half plunged to
344 million Swedish kronor ($59.7 million) from 2.56 billion
kronor a year earlier. Operating profit tumbled 99% to 12
million kronor from 1.02 billion kronor the previous year.
   The year-to-year comparisons were distorted somewhat by
the fact that 1989 was generally considered one of the best
ever for Swedish insurers.
   Skandia said premium revenue in the first half surged 34%
to 12.36 billion kronor from 9.25 billion kronor in the 1989
half. But insurance operations posted a loss of 88 million
kronor, down from a profit of 221 million kronor a year
earlier.
