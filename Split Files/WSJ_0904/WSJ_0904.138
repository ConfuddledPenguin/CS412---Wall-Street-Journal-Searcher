   News reports are constant
   On all sorts of diseases;
   The steady flow of symptoms
   Never really eases.
   But among these is the question
   With which we can dispense:
   It's the article that asks
   Why are we all so tense.
   -- Joshua Adams.

   Straggler's Theory
                                                                                                       

   Self-starters have my deep respect --
   They've earned their lofty rank.
   We laggards follow, I suspect,
   Because we need a crank.
   -- Bert H. Kruse.
