   Swire Pacific Ltd., a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, posted
a 17% decline in first-half profit to 1.09 billion Hong Kong
dollars (US$141.3 million) from HK$1.32 billion a year
earlier, citing an expected drop in property section earnings
in that operation's transition to a property investment
concern from a developer.
   Declines of 17% also were posted in pershare earnings for
Series A stock to 69.1 cents from 82.9 cents, and for Series
B to 13.8 cents from 16.6 cents.

   Revenue increased 5% to HK$14.03 billion from HK$13.4
billion.
   Directors proposed an interim dividend of 23 cents a
Series A share and 4.6 cents a Series B share, both
unchanged.
   Swire's shipping and industries division did well in the
first half, but its aviation units, Cathay Pacific Airways
and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, were hurt by rising
operational costs. Cathay had a lower-than-expected 4%
growth, and the engineering unit's profit fell 8%. A downturn
in retail demand, especially in Taiwan, pared results of
trading operations.
