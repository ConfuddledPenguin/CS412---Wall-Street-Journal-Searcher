   Today, plenty of bankers in white shirts (better to show
the tan) are returning to old mail and August phone messages
after nice long vacations. At least two weeks. Gotta be two
weeks. Or they might get slapped with a regulatory citation.
   What? Has America's banking crisis come to this:
Regulators are now ordering mandatory vacations?

   Absolutely. In fact, they've been doing it for years.
   "It's banking folk wisdom that, believe it or not, is
actually written into our regulatory procedures," says Ellen
Stockdale of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which regulates all federally insured banks. The two-week
policy applies to savings and loans and credit unions as
well. The idea, says Ms. Stockdale, is that "in 10
consecutive business days off, if someone's hand is in the
till, it will show up. It's hard to manipulate the books when
you're on vacation."
   That's right. Summertime . . . and the investigating is
easy.
   The policy "is especially useful in certain types of
fraud, like check kites, deposit scams and playing with trust
funds," says James G. Richmond, who oversees the Justice
Department's probes of savings and loan fraud. "It's not a
simple matter of arresting people after their August getaway,
but in terms of bank fraud, vacation time is a good place to
start."
   Whether banks have a branch in the U.S. or are based here,
they are governed by U.S. regulatory guidelines. Constantin
Phacos, a vice president in the Geneva office of
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., was vacationing in Washington,
D.C., last fall when a customer's call alerted a bank clerk
to accounting irregularities. Mr. Phacos was called home from
his vacation and charged with embezzlement, forgery and
misappropriation of client funds. He denies the charges,
which haven't yet come to trial. Manufacturers Hanover
recently took a $50 million charge against earnings to cover
his alleged crimes.
   "The first thing you should be suspicious of," says Clare
Sykes of New York's Banking Department, "is anyone in banking
who doesn't want to take a vacation.
   "The problem is with Japanese bankers who work here for
banks based in Japan," Ms. Sykes adds. "They're used to
getting one week, and here they take two. But they always are
adamant that we note in our examination reports that it is
required {by regulators}. Otherwise their bosses in Tokyo
will think they're sloughing off."
