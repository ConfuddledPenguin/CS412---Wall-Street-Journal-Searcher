   First Union Corp. said it will sell 100 of its bank
offices for about $116 million.
   The Charlotte, N.C., banking company said the offices --
in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida -- will be sold to an
affiliate of Pitney Bowes Credit Corp., a unit of Pitney
Bowes Inc. in Stamford, Conn. First Union said it will lease
back the branches under a 20-year agreement.

   First Union, which operates 779 bank offices in the
Southeast, said the sale is expected to generate a gain of
about $40 million, which will be recognized over the 20-year
lease. In 1991, the company said, the sale will translate
into net income of about two cents a share. In 1989, First
Union earned $256.2 million, or $2.40 a share.
