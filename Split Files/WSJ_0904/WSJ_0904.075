   When the Exxon Valdez hit the rocks of Prince William
Sound last year, there were predictions of a near-apocalypse
for Alaska's salmon industry. Well, this year's salmon catch
is coming to an end and it turns out it will be the biggest
in history. This news, running counter to the consensus, has
merited barely a whisper of attention.
   So far, the Washington Post reports that 40 million salmon
have been caught, far outstripping the 1987 record harvest of
29 million. Many of the salmon were hatched last spring in
the very waters fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The
rest were released from hatcheries in Prince William Sound
and swam through the same waters on their way to the ocean.
At the largest hatchery in the area, the number of pink
salmon returning to the sound this summer was double the
average of recent years.

   Last year's oil spill apparently had little effect on the
growth of plankton in the sound, the main source of food for
young salmon. Salmon hatcheries report plankton growth was
better than ever this year.
   Dozens of scientists are studying the sound to determine
what lasting effects in other areas, if any, the oil spill
will have. However, in another example of how manic
litigation can muzzle progress, many of the completed studies
have been put under wraps by lawyers doing battle in damage
suits resulting from the spill.
   The Exxon Valdez tragedy taught the oil companies a
lesson: that if they didn't take greater precautions, they
risked the financial future of their firms. But the
environmentalists who jumped on the spill to justify their
philosophy of zero-risk to the environment have refused to
acknowledge that the damage from the Valdez spill was not
irreversible. Their credibilty among informed people will
suffer so long as they insist on promoting the politics of
hysteria.
