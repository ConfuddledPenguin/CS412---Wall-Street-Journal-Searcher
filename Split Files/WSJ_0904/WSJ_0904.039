   AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPUTERS Corp., Akron, Ohio, filed a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, covering 7.5 million common shares previously
sold through private placements. The company said that the
registration permits holders to sell shares, but that it
doesn't expect holders of major blocks of stock to sell their
shares. The company said it has about 13.5 million shares
outstanding, with six million of these relatively widely
held. American Business Computers develops and markets
products, such as soft-drink dispensers, for the food service
industry. Major customers are among the holders of the newly
registered shares.
