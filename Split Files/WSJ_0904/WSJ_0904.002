   Crisis in the Mideast Adds an Unexpected Twist
   To Midterm Elections Already Considered Pivotal

   WASHINGTON -- Suddenly an unpredictable element -- the
Gulf crisis -- has been injected into the fall state and
congressional campaigns.
   For months, candidates have been carefully positioning
themselves on the issues of abortion, the thrift crisis,
campaign finance and the budget. But as the midterm campaigns
get under way in earnest this week, candidates in both
parties are wondering how the current crisis will skew
November's elections.

   "Iraq is the big `X' factor," says Kevin Phillips, the
Republican political theorist. "You have to know how many
casualties there are. You have to know what happens to
hostages. You have to know what happens to oil prices. And
you probably have to know what's happening with the stock
market."
   The political possibilities range from a move to
rally-'round-the-leader, which could help Republicans, to an
economic recession, which could be devastating to
Republicans, to a situation where a standoff or a shooting
war overwhelms all other issues.
   So far, candidates have approached the Middle East crisis
with deliberate caution, lining up behind the president and
seldom voicing any second thoughts about the massive
deployment of U.S. soldiers and materiel to Saudi Arabia;
only in a few scattered states have even the faintest hints
emerged of a debate over U.S. policy toward Saddam Hussein.
But in the next nine weeks, as the contours of the Gulf
crisis become clearer, the issue will surely take on a
political tint.
   "We have moved into the most volatile two months of an
election year in memory," says Paul Maslin, a Democratic
political pollster. "It's foolhardy to think that there won't
be any impact, but it's foolhardy to predict what the impact
will be."
   The Gulf crisis becomes a wild card in a campaign that
already has carried enormous political implications.
   The fall elections will not only determine control of the
governor's office in 35 states, including close contests in
three critical states -- Florida, Texas and California. They
also will play a substantial role in the struggle over
abortion rights -- now primarily a state issue -- and will
have a direct effect on reapportionment and next year's
struggle to redraw the nation's legislative-district lines.
   "These elections will have a lot to say about who serves
in Congress in the next decade," says Alan Heslop, research
associate at the Rose Institute of State and Local Government
at California's Claremont McKenna College. "Parties that lose
in November lose more than one election, because a party in
power can gerrymander itself into retaining a majority for
the rest of the decade."
   Moreover, the fall elections are an important overture to
1992, when President Bush presumably will seek a second term
and when control of the Senate, now held with a 55-45 margin
by the Democrats, could be at stake.
   Democrats must do well in this fall's elections to
buttress themselves for 1992, when they defend 20 seats,
including those of 11 freshmen, many of whom won by extremely
small margins. The Republicans feel that if they can pick up
at least two or three seats, they can win control of the
Senate in the presidential election year of 1992.
   Meanwhile, as the nation girds for possible war and
recession, the candidates are worrying whether their campaign
messages might seem out of sync with public concerns.
   "The situation is forcing people to reconsider their
strategies," says Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "The budget
and the S&amp;L crisis are off the front page, so a lot of ads
and speeches all of a sudden seem out of context."
   At the same time, a number of groups that saw the fall
elections as a critical juncture are troubled that the public
won't get a chance to focus on issues such as abortion. On
television, in newspapers and on the street corner, Iraq is
crowding out nearly every other issue.
   "This crisis is of very great importance, but I'm worried
about the distraction it causes," says Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League. "People aren't talking about change at the Supreme
Court -- a factor that is going to affect the fabric of our
lives for many years to come. And interest in major domestic
issues has diminished."
   Burke Balch, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, believes that the Iraq crisis might help
anti-abortion candidates. Abortion-rights activists "aren't
going to retain their single-issue voters on abortion --
their supporters are interested in a lot of issues, not only
abortion -- but we'll retain ours," he says.
   For the time being at least, many analysts feel that
deepening public concern about events in the Persian Gulf
might benefit incumbents who otherwise were facing the threat
of an anti-Washington backlash. Though the crisis has
accelerated the economic slide, it has also kept incumbents
involved in the summer's major news story in a way that
challengers can't match, and it has diverted attention from
anti-incumbent issues such as the budget standoff and the S&amp;L
bailout.
   "People may not be willing to make quite as many changes,"
says Celinda Lake, a Democratic political pollster. "And
there seem to be bigger issues to talk about than whether
your representative in Congress took an honorarium or not."
   This year's struggles for the governor's office have the
potential to overshadow the congressional elections. Nowhere
is a gubernatorial race more important than in California,
where GOP Sen. Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the
former San Francisco mayor, are running even in the polls;
the winner will preside over reapportionment of the nation's
largest state. As a result of this year's census, California
is expected to add seven House seats to the 47 it currently
holds.
   At the same time, races on the state level will determine
control of important state legislatures, including the New
York state Senate, now dominated by Republicans, and both
houses in Pennsylvania, where Republicans control the Senate
and Democrats control the House.
   In races for national offices, Republicans hope they can
knock off Democratic incumbents in Hawaii, Iowa and Rhode
Island. They expect to hold almost all their own seats,
including in North Carolina, where, in perhaps the nation's
hottest race, Jesse Helms is facing a tough challenge from
former Democratic Mayor Harvey Gantt of Charlotte.
   Little change is expected in the House, where the
re-election rate in the past decade was 94.5%. The Democrats
hope to add marginally to their 62-seat majority. Republicans
take comfort in the argument that the party holding the White
House normally loses seats in midterm elections;
nevertheless, such a loss would underscore the party's
weakness in House races. Even if they held their own,
Republicans would return with only 176 seats.
   As the campaign season gets under way, Republicans are
viewing the president's high support ratings with caution.
"Loss of life {in a Gulf war} could make a big difference,"
warns Linda DiVall, a GOP political consultant. "And when you
combine the economic uncertainties, there's real volatility.
These factors could cause a lot of short-term surges on voter
decisions, and they could either reward or punish the
president's party."
