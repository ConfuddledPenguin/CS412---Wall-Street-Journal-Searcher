   A SEAPORT, Saudi Arabia -- Maj. Gen. Barry McCaffrey leans
against the hood of a jeep as the long, dark boat at the pier
behind him disgorges a long procession of military vehicles.
   A cloud of diesel exhaust obscures the moon as the M-1
tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and all manner of trucks
rumble down a metal ramp, turn right and head toward a
staging area for the long drive into the desert.

   The general is watching the beginning of the second stage
of the military buildup here: the arrival of sea-lifted
materiel from the U.S. An entire army division -- the 24th
Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. -- has
been assembled, loaded on 10 ships and sent halfway around
the world in less than a month.
   Despite the arrival of the first batch of heavy tanks, the
Navy's sea-lift operation has had its share of snafus. Army
commanders, for example, have complained that some ships
haven't been waiting at ports to receive weapons and other
material headed for the Middle East. Other vessels have been
delayed by longer-than-anticipated repair work to get them
ready for the voyage to Saudi Arabia, and at least one ship
has been beset by major mechanical problems along the way.
   Under rules imposed on the press, the size of units or
their locations can't be disclosed, but an Army division
contains between 15,000 and 20,000 men. "Suffice it to say we
have already tripled the amount of armor in the country with
our first two ships," the general says.
   The landing of the 24th, whose 32-knot sea-lift ships made
the voyage through the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Suez,
the Red Sea and the steamlike fog of the Persian Gulf in 16
days, isn't an isolated logistics triumph. It is the
beginning of a procession of hulking gray supply ships needed
to give the largely airlifted U.S. forces here bulk and
staying power.
   Lying on the concrete jetty behind the general, rows of
tired soldiers wait in the humid night for their vehicles to
emerge from the USNS Regulus. Some of their stories involve
hardship and sacrifice.
   Lt. David Gray, 26 years old, had a whirlwind, three-month
courtship of Stephanie Rouquie of Savannah, Ga. Starting with
a blind date, they were married Aug. 6. The alert call came
at 2 a.m. the following morning. He had one hour to get to
the base. "We weren't quite asleep yet," he recalls.
   Cpl. Kenneth Simon, 25, and his wife had just settled into
a new apartment in Hinesville, Ga. They had been married for
one year, but for most of that year, Cpl. Simon had been in
South Korea. Their furniture had just arrived when the call
came. Because Cpl. Simon was an M-1 tank driver, he was
needed to fill a vacancy in a departing unit. He wasn't
alone, he says. "When this happened they just started
grabbing people from everywhere. A lot of the folks here were
supposed to go to Germany."
   Every military story has someone like Michael Cook, 20, of
Columbia, Tenn. A fuzzy-cheeked private, he had just finished
five months of basic training when he was told he was going
to Saudi Arabia. "Myself, I didn't believe it. I thought I'd
get some more training."
   A few soldiers didn't make the trip. One of them was a
medic who diagnosed himself insane and threatened suicide.
This was a problem for Chief Warrant Officer Randy Jackson,
37, who heads the medic's unit. "He cracked up and we put him
out of the Army. Better we find out there than over here."
   The 24th is a far cry from the assemblage of National
Guard units and draftees the U.S. landed on the North African
coast in 1942 -- the nation's only previous experience with
desert warfare. They were untrained, poorly equipped and
unprepared to handle the Desert Fox, Germany's Field Marshall
Erwin Rommel.
   Gen. McCaffrey says he juggled emergency shipments from
nine ammunition factories to get the best for his men, who
have the latest high-technology weaponry.
   Until now, U.S. battle plans have relied largely on the
tank-killing capabilities of helicopters to blunt Iraqi
forces, should they move across the border. According to Maj.
Dan Grigson, public affairs officer for the 101st Airborne
Division, the helicopter and airborne units would then "pass
the battle" over to the more heavily armed Marine units
behind them.
   With the addition of the much heavier 24th, the U.S. would
be able to fight a new kind of desert warfare. Its armored
units are trained to fight a moving battle at night, using
communications and targeting systems that give each soldier
an average of 10 times the firepower of soldiers in the
1970s-style Iraqi army, according to Gen. McCaffrey.
   As for the human element, no story would be complete
without the Old Veteran. The soldiers were visited during the
weekend by two congressional delegations, including veterans
from World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
   Among them was Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.), one of those
National Guardsmen mobilized to fight Rommel's Afrika Corps
in 1942. Rep. Fascell, 73, still has vivid memories of
driving a truck through smoking battlefields and seeing
Bedouins removing jewelry from the dead.
   Dining with the soldiers here on freeze-dried field
rations, he recalled evenings when the troops dined on camel
meat, which Rep. Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, says he doesn't recommend.
   While there were some defeats, he said, the Americans and
the British finally drove Rommel from the desert. "Frankly,
the American soldier can adapt to almost anything," he said.
