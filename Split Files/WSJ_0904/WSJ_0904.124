   Bank Building &amp; Equipment Corp. of America, St. Louis,
which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal

   Bank Building will sell the consulting, architectural
design and construction contracts of its Financial Facilities
and Financial Research Associates divisions and its Modular
Buildings, Inc. subsidiary. The purchase price wasn't
disclosed.
   Various other Bank Building executives also will be
joining the new company.
   "The management, consulting, design, construction and
marketing teams will remain intact at the new company," Mr.
Golitz said, adding that the company would start with a staff
of 88 people at four regional offices in St. Louis; Hartford,
Conn.; Atlanta; and Clearwater, Fla. The company also expects
to open a western divisional office in California.
