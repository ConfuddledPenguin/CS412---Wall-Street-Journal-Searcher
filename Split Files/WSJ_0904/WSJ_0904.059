   SYDNEY, Australia -- Janet Holmes a Court plans to assume
control of the Australian family's international corporate
interests following the unexpected death of her husband,
Robert Holmes a Court.
   The 53-year-old Australian businessman, who died of a
heart attack Sunday at his horse farm near Perth, was widely
known for his audacious takeover raids.

   A statement issued on behalf of the family and the private
company that Mr. Holmes a Court founded and headed,
Heytesbury Holdings Ltd., said that Mrs. Holmes a Court
"would take control of the company with the close assistance
of her eldest son, {21-year-old} Peter, and senior managers."
Mrs. Holmes a Court is deputy chairman of Heytesbury and has
been "closely involved in the day-to-day running" of the
company for many years, the statement said.
   The family members also signaled that they intend to
pursue the business strategy that Mr. Holmes a Court mapped.
"The business units within the Heytesbury organization {will}
continue to develop and grow in the way the late chairman
would have wished," said Jon Elbery, Heytesbury's general
manager.
   Heytesbury is the largest private land owner in Australia
and has interests in some small newspapers in Western
Australia. Mr. Holmes a Court's companies also have stakes in
various corporations around the world, including a 6% stake
in the Really Useful Group PLC, a British entertainment
vehicle controlled by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Earlier
this year, Mr. Holmes a Court's strategic shareholding
thwarted a move by Mr. Webber to take the company private.
Through a joint venture with Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine
of France, Mr. Holmes a Court's companies control about 5% of
Dalgety PLC, a British food and commodity group.
   At his death, though, Mr. Holmes a Court's corporate
empire was a shadow of its former self after being ravaged in
the October 1987 stock-market crash. In its heyday, his
publicly listed company, Bell Group Ltd., and its Bell
Resources Ltd. unit controlled about six billion Australian
dollars (US$4.91 billion) in assets. And for a while, the
South African-born lawyer turned corporate raider struck
terror in boardrooms around the world, earning a reputation
for toughness and cunning.
   At home, he made several takeover tilts at Broken Hill
Proprietary Co., a mining, oil and steel concern that is
Australia's largest company. In the U.S., he threatened to
take over Asarco Inc., a New York mining and smelting company
with Australian interests. Then he built a stake in USX
Corp., the large steel concern. But his splashiest play was
to amass a stake of nearly 10% in Texaco Inc., the U.S. oil
giant, at a cost of nearly US$1 billion. All those various
stakes have since been sold.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Holmes a Court became one of Australia's
first billionaires. But his corporate empire relied on
borrowed funds and it began to unravel in the months
following the stock-market crash as investors withdrew credit
lines. He bowed out of the public spotlight by selling his
Bell Group interests in 1988.
