   In the next days, we will get our first sign of whether
Congress has learned anything from its Savings and Loan
disaster. One of the peripheral items in the summit
negotiations on the budget is an effort to price the value of
the implied guarantees the government gives the federally
created mortgage packagers, the Federal National Mortgage
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the push-me-pull-yous of
American finance, strange creatures presumably owned by
stockholders but exempt from state and local taxes, enjoying
a statutory line of credit at the Treasury, and reporting to
boards of directors that include five presidential appointees
among their 18 members.
   The taxpayer is now stuck with half a trillion dollars or
so in liabilities for the insurance of S&amp;L deposits -- plus
God knows how much more to pay off depositors in busted banks
-- because deposit insurance was ludicrously underpriced with
reference to the risks the banks and S&amp;Ls were taking with
depositors' money. Fannie and Freddie get their guarantees
for nothing, and can leverage their investors capital at a
rate of more than 100-to-1 because the purchasers of their
debt issues know the government will pay off if the agencies
goof. "Federal ties," says the General Accounting Office,
"cause investors to behave like insured depositors who
believe their investments to be very safe."

   In his "obiter dicta" to the proposed 1991 budget, Office
of Management and Budget director Richard Darman noted that
the debt of the various government sponsored enterprises
could at any time, like the obligations of the Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., turn into a huge addition to
the federal budget deficit -- and urged that something be
done about it -- now. The ball was then picked up and
advanced by several congressmen, most notably Leon Panetta of
the Budget Committee (D., Calif.), J.J. Pickle of Government
Oversight (D., Texas) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) of the
Banking Committee.
   In response, the two mortgage corporations -- presumably
with the approval of the presidentially appointed directors
-- launched an expensive advertising campaign that included
two-page ads to present themselves as the real reason why so
many Americans can own their homes. They also hired the best
lobbyists money can buy -- Joe Califano and Harry McPherson
for FNMA, Charls Walker for FHLMC. Fannie Mae, believe it or
not, has its own PAC, from the "voluntary contributions" of
its well-paid executives.
   The agencies also started mobilizing the troops of
bankers, mortgage bankers and investment bankers who make
money on their dealings with Fannie and Freddie. And the
troops responded with telephone calls and letters and visits
to their favorite congressman. As Salomon Bros. learned when
it led an investment banking group trying to keep for the
truly private sector the business of packaging the new
multitranche Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits
(REMICS) that Congress had authorized in 1986, Fannie's CEO
David O. Maxwell takes hostages and may kill them. For some
months, Fannie cut "Sali" out of its dealer network. As
reported in this newspaper on April 20, 1987, Fannie Mae's
CEO said Salomon had been eliminated "because of our
perception that they do not give us any indication that they
value our business very highly." This time, Sali is on
Fannie's side. You betcha.
   The administration, however, has persisted. In May, the
Treasury came up with an ingenious device to reduce the
government's risks from the $700 billion or so of paper
issues or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. Ask the
private-sector ratings services to rate the agencies' bonds
and pass-throughs on the assumption that there is no
government guarantee. If they can't qualify for a triple-A
rating now, make them file a "business plan" to earn such a
rating, beef up their capital and accept limits on their
growth, dividend payments and leverage ratios.
   Freddie was uncomfortable. Its chairman Leland C. Brendsel
said the idea of using ratings services "deserves more
serious attention," though the requirement of a triple-A
rating was "extreme. . . . A double-A standard would be more
reasonable." Behind the sweet talk, however, Mr. Brendsel
went around the country to the boards of the state saving and
loan leagues to say that any restrictions on the operations
of the mortgage corporations would be nails in their coffins.
(Which is, incidentally, quite untrue: It's the existence of
government-subsidized portfolio investors in mortgages --
especially Fannie Mae -- that undercuts the profit potential
of an S&amp;L.)
   Fannie went through the roof. One of its myrmidons
distributed around Congress a one-page sheet of "Reasons to
Reject OMB/Treasury Proposal." They were not trivial. Making
Fannie and Freddie earn a triple-A rating would mean
"Destruction of the Secondary Mortgage Market . . .
Additional Bank and Thrift Insolvencies; Increase in RTC
Losses . . . Rise in Mortgage Rates . . . Exacerbates
Recessionary Tendencies . . . Abdication of Governmental
Responsibility."
   Anyway, both agencies insist, their activities don't pose
any risk of loss to the government. They constantly run
"stress tests," in which awful things happen to the country
and the mortgage market and they make money anyway because
they're so well run. The Fannie "stress test" assumes nine
years of nationwide loss experience as bad as the recent
Texas loss experience, or a sudden rise of six percentage
points in interest rates, sustained for six years.
   Surely Fannie Mae cannot have it both ways. If in fact
their paper is ironclad against the most severe stress, then
the rating agencies will give them a triple-A and the market
will let them borrow for peanuts over Treasury rates without
guarantees. The few little changes that might have to be made
to achieve that result could not possibly produce the list of
horribles on Fannie's sheet of "Reasons" (which carried,
incidentally, no statement of its provenance).
   And if the list of horribles is right, then clearly the
agencies are now leaning very hard on their government
guarantees to sell their paper, which means the Treasury is
right to be demanding assurances from knowledgeablethird
parties that the taxpayer is not about to be taken to the
cleaners again. Nobody denies that the agencies are well run
today. But, after all, Mr. Maxwell came to Fannie Mae in 1981
from a private company, TICOR Mortgage Insurance, when TICOR
seemed to have been well run. A few years later, TICOR went
down in flames.
   President Reagan's Commission on Housing, of which I was a
commissioner, recommended in 1982 that federal guarantees of
Fannie and Freddie paper be phased out as part of a program
to increase loans to housing through the capital markets.
"These corporations," we said, "should not have such unfair
competitive advantages over other private institutions that
market inefficiencies develop." Thanks to the S&amp;L experience,
the focus has now changed from perfecting the mortgage market
to protecting the taxpayer, but the principle is the same.
   Freddie is still to some extent in transition from
ownership by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to private
ownership. Fannie is a full-blooded private corporation that
last year paid its CEO (in salary and stock options) about 24
times what the country paid the president of the U.S. The
government subsidy represented by the free guarantee clearly
helps to pay for that salary, and for increases in the Fannie
Mae dividend, as well as for marginal reductions in mortgage
interest rates.
   Earlier this year, Fannie promised that it would increase
its equity capital and loan loss reserves by somewhere
between $2 billion and $2.5 billion before the end of 1991.
But in mid-August, with truly breathtaking arrogance, the
agency announced a half-billion dollar buy-back program for
its stocks and warrants, reducing the equity cushion that
protects the taxpayer against possible losses. This was,
Fannie said, a "technical matter" -- i.e., we think we can
sell stock next year for more than it costs us to buy it this
year. It is hard to think of a more inappropriate use of a
government guarantee.
   If the market assigns a value to the federal guarantee of
such an institution, that value should be reflected on the
government's own books as a government expenditure. We can
structure our financial world so that pigs get free lunches,
as we did with S&amp;L regulation, but the government never gets
a free lunch. This is why the question belongs at the budget
summit, and should be resolved there. The question now is
whether the gallant band of Congressmen who have been working
with the administration can keep their nerve.
