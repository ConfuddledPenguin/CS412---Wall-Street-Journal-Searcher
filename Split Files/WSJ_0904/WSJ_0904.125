   NEW YORK -- Seat prices on the nation's two main stock
exchanges continue to erode, but soaring oil prices have
bumped up the price of a seat on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where oil futures are traded.
   A seat on the American Stock Exchange sold Thursday for
$100,000, a 10-year low, one week after seat prices on the
New York Stock Exchange reached their lowest level since the
end of 1984.

   The latest sale on the Amex was down $7,500 from the
previous sale Aug. 20. Amex seats, currently quoted at
$95,000 bid and $120,000 asked, reached a peak of $420,000 on
Oct. 9 and Oct. 16, 1987. The latter sale came on the last
trading day before the stock market crashed 22.6% on Monday,
Oct. 19.
   Big Board seat prices lately have bounced around at low
levels. One sold Aug. 23 for $301,000, a 5 1/2-year low. Last
Tuesday, one sold for $309,000; then on Friday, another sold
for $305,000. New York Stock Exchange seats now are quoted at
$301,000 bid and $350,000 asked; they peaked at $1,150,000 on
Sept. 21, 1987.
   Normally on both stock exchanges, "seat prices reflect
expectations of the level of trading volume" over the next 18
to 24 months, says Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical
Securities Inc. Lower trading volume means less revenue for
brokerage firms, reducing the value of a membership on the
exchange.
   As for the current outlook, the analyst says, "Seat prices
will continue to decline as long as we're stuck on the Saudi
peninsula," referring to U.S. military forces sent to Saudi
Arabia in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a month ago.
   A fundamental reason stock-exchange seat prices are down
is that with the advent of electronic order execution, the
exchanges have "less need for as many people on the floor,"
says Dudley Eppel, managing director of equity trading at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   On the New York Merc, however, seat prices have risen
since the crisis in the Middle East broke out Aug. 2. The
current bid for a seat is $250,000 and the offer price
$350,000; the past three sales were July 25 at $260,000, Aug.
14 at $270,000 and Aug. 21 at $290,000. If the trend
continues, Nymex seat prices could pass those of the Big
Board for the first time.
