   Gradco Systems Inc. adjourned its annual meeting last
Friday after 8.9%-holder Plenum Publishing Corp. and its
chairman Martin Tash said they would seek to elect their own
slate of directors.
   Plenum disclosed its plans in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission earlier last week. Gradco, an Irving,
Calif., maker of paper-handling equipment, responded by
adjourning the meeting until Oct. 12 to give the company time
to mail additional proxy materials regarding Plenum's recent
actions to shareholders.
