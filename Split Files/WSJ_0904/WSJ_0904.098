   DEARBORN, Mich. -- When the year began, Ford Motor Co. was
on a roll in the U.S. auto market.
   Company executives told reporters that Ford's situation so
differed from beleaguered General Motors Corp. and Chrysler
Corp. that they no longer considered Ford part of the U.S.
Big Three. Alexander Trotman, who runs Ford's huge North
American auto operations, declared that, despite tougher
competition, "we don't have it in our plans to lose market
share."

   But the best-laid plans sometimes go astray.
   Ford, including its Lincoln and Mercury lines, took just
20.4% of U.S. car sales in this year's first seven months,
down more than two full percentage points from 1989. Now it
appears nearly impossible for Ford to equal its car-market
share of last year. A decline would be the company's first
since 1986.
   The big problem is the Escort. Ford spent $1.9 billion to
develop a new version of the economy car, but Escort sales
are running 22% behind a year ago. Taurus and Mercury Sable
sales also have dropped, and sales of the venerable Mustang
have fallen off a cliff.
   Not that Ford is mired in gloom. Far from it. The new
Explorer sport-utility vehicle is a smash hit that has
Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee on the run and Ford's truck-market
share on the rise. Another big success is the new, rounded
Lincoln Town Car, which has moved Lincoln within striking
distance of GM's Cadillac division as the No. 1 seller of
luxury cars.
   Ford officials also expect sales of the Escort and its
sister model, the Mercury Tracer, to improve in the second
half. "Most of our bad news is behind us," says Thomas
Wagner, head of the Ford brand marketing division, the
company's largest. "I feel a great wind in our sails."
   Nonetheless, the company's first-half performance is
enough to make Ford watchers, and some company officials,
nervous. Just two years ago, Ford was making more money than
any car company in history, sitting atop a $9 billion cash
hoard and virtually free of debt. But this year, first-half
profits fell 58%. The cash kitty has melted away, because of
some big acquisitions and the fact that Ford's first-half
capital spending exceeded GM's for the first time in modern
history. The company borrowed $2.6 billion in the second
quarter alone.
   "They've lost momentum," says David Healy, an analyst with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "Most of their most recent model
introductions, with the exception of Explorer, haven't been
terribly successful. And some of their older, more successful
models like Taurus/Sable are getting a little long in the
tooth."
   When the new Escort was introduced in April, Ford
officials called it the most important launch in company
history. That's because strong sales of the fuel-efficient
Escort would allow Ford to keep selling its highly profitable
big cars -- such as the Town Car -- while complying with
federal fuel economy requirements. The profits from the big
cars, Mr. Wagner explained in April, would help "fund
new-product programs in the middle 1990s."
   Four months later, Mr. Wagner concedes that the Escort
launch hasn't gone smoothly. First, the new Escorts were
forced to compete with 60,000 old-model Escorts that looked
similar, cost less, and carried a $1,000 rebate to boot.
Customers promptly turned their back on the new Escort,
despite its peppier engine and improved suspension.
   "We kind of confused the public by advertising the new
Escort," says Mr. Wagner, "and when they came to the
dealership, they saw the old Escort."
   Ford got in this bind because it continued to manufacture
old 1990-model Escorts for a month after the first new
1991-model Escorts arrived in dealer showrooms in April. Ford
took this unusual step to be sure it didn't run out of
Escorts while production of the new model was gradually
increasing to full speed. Ford underestimated the
difficulties of selling two cars at the same time "with the
same name and different model years," says Mr. Wagner, and
now regrets the move.
   By now, most old Escorts have been sold, but other
problems remain. Production start-up difficulties caused Ford
to run short of the two models that have proved most popular
with customers: the Escort station wagon and the sporty
Escort GT. Ford says it doesn't expect to have the proper
"model mix" until Oct. 1.
   Moreover, the Escort's market segment, subcompacts, is
extremely competitive. Sales in this segment have plunged 17%
so far this year, far more than the 2.5% decline in overall
car and truck sales. Ford's competitors have attacked the
problem with sales incentives to consumers or dealers,
forcing the company to abandon its hope of selling the new
Escort without such price cuts.
   In early August, Ford started offering cut-rate 4.8%
financing on Escort and Tracer loans up to 48 months. The
daily selling rate of Escorts has almost doubled since then,
says Robert Rewey, Ford's vice president of sales. "We said,
`Now is the time to put {our} dealers nose to nose with the
Japanese,' and that's what we've done," Mr. Rewey says. "And
I think that's beginning to show in the market."
   Dealers and analysts expect the new Escort to do well in
the long run, especially if the subcompact market gets a
boost from rising gasoline prices. But they also note that
the Escort will face growing competition this fall. Nissan
Motor Co. is preparing to introduce a new Sentra subcompact,
and GM will launch its Saturn car in October. Honda Motor Co.
is expected to roll out a new Civic next year.
   The Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable already are being hurt
by new competition. Their sales have dropped 12% so far this
year, in contrast to a gain of more than 20% for the 1990
Honda Accord, which became larger to compete squarely against
the two Ford cars. GM also has introduced a stable of new
four-door sedans.
   "The Taurus is a hell of a car, but it hasn't changed in a
long time," says Wayne Harding, a Ford dealer in Santa
Monica, Calif. Indeed, while the Taurus certainly was the
most influential car design of the 1980s, it hasn't been
restyled since its introduction in December 1985. For a year,
Ford has been trying to address that issue with advertising
-- specifically, a campaign that says: "If you introduced it
today, the Ford Taurus would still be ahead of its time."
   But more substantive changes may be needed. Ford is making
one this fall by giving Taurus and Sable an electronically
controlled automatic transmission, which provides better fuel
economy and acceleration than the current transmission. The
Taurus will also get a more powerful, four-cylinder base
engine. But partly as a result, the price of the cheapest
Taurus will jump by $1,077, or 8.5%. The Taurus will get a
minor styling update next year, but not until the 1995 model
year will it get an all-new exterior and engine.
   Taurus, though, is just a young pup compared with today's
Mustang. Though it was "freshened up" four years ago, the
current version of the Mustang essentially dates from 1978.
"The Mustang is just old," says auto analyst Maryann Keller
of Furman Selz Inc.
   Ford executives, however, dispute the notion that the
Mustang is running out of gas. Last year's sales, notes Mr.
Wagner, were pumped up by 28,000 Mustangs sold early in the
year to rental companies in conjuction with the 25th
anniversary of the Mustang. Excluding that, he says, Mustang
sales this year have fallen only slightly from 1989.
   Whatever the reasons, Ford's market-share struggles in the
U.S. come at a difficult time for the company. Just last
fall, Ford shelled out $2.5 billion to buy Jaguar PLC, and it
may have to spend that much more again to turn around the
British car maker. Ford also -- to its credit -- is spending
heavily to bring out a badly needed line of engines and
transmissions for its own cars. And it will face additional
capital spending to redo the Mustang, Taurus and other aging
Ford products.
   Dealers are optimistic that the company's short-term pain
will pay off. In the 1980s, "Ford came out with a lot of new
products and really increased market share," says Mr.
Harding, the Ford dealer from Santa Monica. "We're in the
trough now, but we've got to wait for our new products and
we'll regain market share."
