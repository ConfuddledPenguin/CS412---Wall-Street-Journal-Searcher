   Despite the encouraging opinion of S. Fred Singer
(editorial page, Aug. 8) that the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve's 600 million gallons is not as effective as private
reserves of oil in a free market, he fails to consider that
an increased supply of natural gas in the Northeast would be
an important element affecting our energy dependency on OPEC
oil.
   For example, Canadian gas from the Iroquois pipeline would
equal the equivalent of 5% of the oil stored in the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. By displacing the energy equivalent of
more than 30 million barrels of oil annually, the Iroquois
pipeline would help offset the supply imbalance created by
the embargo. Unfortunately, just one week before Iraq invaded
Kuwait, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
voted, after four years of exhaustive hearings and
overwhelmingly favorable evidence, to delay approval of the
Iroquois pipeline in favor of additional hearings.

   Clearly, FERC's decision could not have come at a worse
time. The Iraqi crisis underscores the Northeast's critical
need for reliable, secure supplies of energy that the
pipeline will deliver. Regardless of whether the government
sells oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the fact is,
as long as we depend on imported oil, we will be hostage to
hostile regimes and uncertain supplies.
