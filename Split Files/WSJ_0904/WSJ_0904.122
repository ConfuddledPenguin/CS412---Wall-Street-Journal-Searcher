   WAR FEARS and new recession talk don't affect hiring
plans.
   Most employers say their already weak employment outlooks
aren't further weakened so far by the Mideast crisis, the
latest recession worries or the stock market decline. Scott
Paper is "staffing for attrition only," but no layoffs are
planned -- for now. Higher oil prices just confirm Dow
Chemical's earlier decision to hire fewer professionals amid
slumping chemical business.

   The war threat reaffirms the wisdom of recent job cuts at
Armco Inc., a New Jersey steel-products firm, and hiring
caution by Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, an Ohio business forms and
computer systems supplier, those firms say. Storage
Technology hires more engineers, but fewer unskilled workers.
National Gypsum may use attrition to pare its force, with
housing starts declining.
   But Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, a fast-growing apparel
retailer, may add more than 2,000 people by early 1992.
                                                                                                       

   VACATIONS MAY BE more stressful than restful.
   Many signs of strain in a study of 29 Tel Aviv University
computer center workers during Passover vacation were as
great as or greater than during hectic computer shutdowns or
startups or routine work. The workers perceived vacation time
as relaxing, but anxiety, depression or elevated blood
pressure often didn't subside on vacation, said Dov Eden, the
management professor who did the study.
   "For many workers, being at home is no picnic," Mr. Eden
said. "Work addicts" see vacations as a form of "imposed
disengagement from work," and, he added, "It is likely that
job stress carries over to vacation time much more than
vacation joy spills over" to post-vacation work. A brief
pre-vacation slowdown might make the leave more restful, Mr.
Eden suggested.
                                                                                                       

   RELAXING OR NOT, vacations are often followed by the
blues.
   Post-leave letdowns are more prevalent as the summer
vacation season winds down, says Paul Kazmierski, Rochester
Institute of Technology psychology professor. Manager purges
and workers' stressful lives add to post-vacation blues, he
says. Frequent short leaves are less therapeutic, agrees Mary
Kuconis, of Stride Rite. Vicki Coke, a Hecla Mining
spokeswoman, took three weeks to rebound from a one-week
vacation.
   Most employees return to find a heavy work load, a Unisys
official says. One remedy: "Hang out in the copier room a
little longer," says SunBank lender Ronald Harris. Rosa
Egusquiza, a customer rep at the bank, advises: "Think about
your next vacation."
   But vacations "revitalize" BankAmerica PR woman Bernice
Riordan; so, too, for workers at Alcon Laboratories in Texas
and Omni Hotels in New Hampshire, officials say.
                                                                                                       

   SALARY INCREASES in 1991 may trail inflation for the first
time since 1980, says consultant William M. Mercer. Its
survey of over 3,000 employers shows an average 5.4% pay
rise, easing from 5.5% in 1990. A similar poll by Wyatt Co.,
another consultant, forecasts an average 5.6% salary rise in
1991, down from 5.7% this year.
                                                                                                       

   SOME WORKER BENEFITS beyond legal requirements will be
provided to reservists called to military duty by 62% of 114
employers surveyed by the International Foundation of
Employee Benefit Plans. Life insurance will continue for 49%;
disability coverage, 28%; medical-dental coverage, 53%; and
all these, 26%. Mutual Benefit Life will waive life insurance
premiums for up to two years.
                                                                                                       

   MORE ORGANIZING GAINS are registered by labor unions. They
won 49.8% of NLRB-supervised representation elections last
year, up from 48.6% in 1988 and a recent low of 45.9% in
1985, the Bureau of National Affairs, a reporting service,
says.
                                                                                                       

   DEEP DISPARITIES: It costs a young new worker $890 a month
to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Honolulu, but only $280 in
Oklahoma City, says living-cost consultant Runzheimer
International. Or $733 in the New York area, $700 in San Jose
and $670 in Washington, D.C., vs. $285 in Austin, Texas, and
$290 in Colorado Springs.
                                                                                                       

   PAID PARENTAL LEAVE gains a foothold, and may spread.
   Family leaves have mostly been unpaid, but over a third of
68 firms with leave policies offer some form of continued
salary, a Buck Consultants survey shows. Often, the payment
is for maternity medical leave. The trend is growing, says
Buck's Barbara Adolph, though managerial and professional
employees will benefit most. Some employers see a competitive
edge, but many shun the idea as costly and as inducing
workers to stay at home longer.
   A few states ponder paid-leave laws. A New York state
panel proposed requiring partial pay to workers taking leave
to care for new babies or ill family members, financed by
increased worker and employee disability insurance. A couple
could get half of weekly wages, up to $170 a week -- one
parent for a maximum of 16 weeks, or a combined total of 20
weeks.
   A Massachusetts legislative committee hopes to approve a
similar partial-pay family-leave bill by this fall.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: State and local government workers won an
average 5.1% annual wage raise in contracts signed the first
half of this year, up from 4.6% in their previous pacts. . .

creates a government-service curriculum for Washington, D.C.,
high-school students.
