   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Metal Corp., Japan's largest
integrated nonferrous smelter, said construction of its
planned copper refinery plant in Texas has been delayed
because state authorities and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency haven't approved the project.
   Though the project has been approved in most respects, it
hasn't been authorized according to air-pollution standards,
Mitsubishi Metal said.

   The company said it will exchange views with the state and
the EPA on its "continuous smelting and converting process,"
which, Mitsubishi Metal maintained, doesn't disrupt the
environment and operates with lower costs.
   A spokesman said Mitsubishi Metal's local subsidiary,
Texas Copper Corp., had planned to invest 25 billion yen
($173.1 million) to build the copper refinery plant in Texas
City.
   Initially, construction had been expected to begin by the
end of 1989, and the plant was scheduled to begin operations
by the end of 1991. The plant is to turn out crude copper
totaling 150,000 tons a year. As a result of the delay,
construction is to start by the end of 1991, and operations
are to begin by the end of 1993.
