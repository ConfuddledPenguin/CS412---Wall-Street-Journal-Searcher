   Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in Monday's afternoon
session as speculative shares were sold on rumors that
financial authorities had begun investigating the possible
stock manipulation behind recent stock price surges of Honshu
Paper &amp; Pulp.
   Share prices closed higher in London, but were unable to
sustain the peak that came at the opening of trading as a
holiday on Wall Street damped trading volume.

   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down 557.94
points at 25,420.43. The index gained 308.41 points Friday to
25,978.37 as stocks rose in moderately active trading Friday,
fueled by buying on speculative issues.
   At the end of morning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei
index was down 343.48 points to 25076.95.
   In Monday's trading, the indexes moved narrowly in the
morning session due to little buying and selling, then
dropped at a fast pace in the afternoon.
   In addition to declines on prices of speculative shares,
the market failed to support stock prices because of a lack
of buying, traders said.
   Sentiment was also damped, traders said, by the upturn of
oil prices as well as by a Japanese wire news report quoting
the London Sunday Times that the U.S. had unofficially
decided to use military force against Iraq.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 360 million
shares, down from 592 million shares Friday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 607 to 346,
while 149 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all issues
listed in the first section, which gained 17.95 points
Friday, was down 28.05 points, or 1.42%, at 1,945.92.
   The second section index, which advanced 59.62 points
Friday, was down 8.62 points, or 0.23%, to close at 3,821.84.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at eight
million shares, down from 14.8 million shares Friday.
   Also pushing down stock prices Monday were rounds of heavy
arbitrage selling linked to the unwinding of September
futures contracts ahead of their expiration on Sept. 13,
traders said.
   Among sharp losers was Honshu Paper, which lost 500 yen
($3.46) to finish at 4,380 yen. The issue rose 1,020 yen in
the week of Aug. 23 as rumors on buying by a speculator group
prompted buying by dealers and individual investors. However,
as rumors on the investigation were spread on the market
Monday afternoon, losses extended to other shares that had
also been bought on rumors of speculative buying, traders
said.
   Kurabo, which surged nearly 600 yen in the past week,
ended the day at 1,829 yen, down 80 yen.
   The impact of losses made by speculative shares Monday was
strong as they were the major focus of buying activity in the
past week, said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock
trading at Okasan Securities.
   Traders said investors were mostly calm about the report
on the possible U.S. military attack on Iraq. As reflected on
Monday's overall trade volume, there was a small amount of
selling, they said.
   "It (the report) was mostly perceived as speculation,"
said Shigeru Akiba, head of equity at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
International.
   "But it certainly sent investors to the sidelines. They
can't buy with such news reported," he said.
   Material manufacturing sectors were lower Monday,
including steel, chemical and paper and pulp, whose earnings
are expected to be hurt most severely by higher oil prices.
   Particularly, steel companies were sold by institutions
who were discouraged by poor outlooks for earnings for the
current fiscal year, reported by a local newspaper during the
weekend. In addition to higher oil prices, higher interest
rates are likely to damage steel companies' profits, traders
said.
   NKK lost 15 yen to 465 yen, while Kobe Steel fell 12 yen
to 485 yen.
   Advancing issues included electricals and resource stocks.
Nippon Oil was up 10 yen to 1,100 yen, while Teikoku Oil
gained 60 yen to 1,420 yen.
   C. Itoh was bought on reports that the trading house will
begin importing crude oil from Indonesia in December. C. Itoh
ended at 700 yen, up 15 yen.
   London shares closed higher, but traders said volume was
kept at recent levels by the U.S. holiday and developments in
the Middle East, including the unsuccessful end to United
Nations-Iraqi talks.
   "Market makers are doing what they want with prices," one
trader said. "No one wants to deal with them."
   Initially, the softening in the pound helped equities to
rise modestly. But the rally began to fade late in the
morning, when higher-than-expected retail sales figures for
July were reported. The report showed a rise of 1.31% on the
month, up from the provisional report of a 1% rise, and
suggested hopes of an imminent cut in U.K. interest rates
were misplaced.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 3.8 points at 2,166.6. The index gained 9.2
points on Friday to close at 2,162.8.
   The narrower FT 30-share index closed down 6.2 points at
1,687.4, slightly down from Friday's figure of 1,693.6.
   Volume Monday was 220.2 million shares. Friday's volume
was 357.5 million shares.
   In the futures markets, the December 100-index contract
was trading at 2,233.5, down from Friday's close of 2,244.5.
   Profit-taking in banking stocks, which have enjoyed a big
mark-up recently, led to an easing in share prices. Lloyds
Bank shares fell 5 pence (9.6 cents) to 269 pence. Shares in
Barclays Bank fell 3 pence to 356 pence, and Midland Bank
shares fell 5 pence to 258 pence.
   An initial upward momentum was shaved off
domestic-market-oriented stocks as July retail sales figures
indicated a drop in U.K. interest rates would not be likely.
Rank Hovis shares fell a penny to 294 pence. Thames Water
shares dropped 2 pence to 228 pence. Allied-Lyons shares
dropped 5 pence to 484 pence.
   Folowing a buy notice from two securities houses, shares
in British Aerospace rose 12 pence to 544 pence. British
Aerospace is part of the Airbus Industrie consortium, which
Sunday said it expects to be profitable for the first time
this year.
   Polly Peck shares fell 6 pence to 285 pence after being up
as much as 6 pence shortly after the report of a 72% rise in
pretax profit for the first six months of the year. Analysts,
however, said they remain wary of the company's standing
following a stock exchange investigation into the chairman's
aborted move to take the company private.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Brussels,
Frankfurt, Milan, Paris and Stockholm; mixed in Zurich, and
little changed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
mixed.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei, Manila and Wellington, but surged higher in Seoul.
