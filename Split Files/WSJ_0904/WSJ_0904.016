   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., seeking a foothold
in Europe's over-the-counter drug market, agreed to acquire a
one-third stake in UPSA Group, a French non-prescription drug
concern.
   Bristol-Myers wouldn't disclose the price, but said the
transaction was an important strategic move that, among other
things, would make UPSA's distribution channels available to
the U.S. company's over-the-counter products. It also
reflects moves among other U.S. companies to increase their
presence in the European market in advance of 1992, when most
trade restrictions within Europe are scheduled to be lifted.

   Analysts estimated the immediate value of the transaction
at about $80 million, based on estimates that the entire
company would be valued at $250 million -- between one and
two times annual sales. While analysts generally applauded
the move, the financial impact on Bristol-Myers, at least in
the near term, will apparently be slight. Bristol-Myers
wouldn't comment on the estimates.
   Privately held UPSA, based in Agen, France, specializes in
effervescent pain relievers and vitamin products. It had net
income of 57 million French francs ($14 million) in 1988, on
sales of 936 million francs, the most recent results
available. Sales are expected to reach 1.2 billion francs in
1990, or about $230 million based on current exchange rates,
said Richard Vietor, drug industry analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. Sales of similar products at Bristol-Myers exceeded $580
million last year; the company's total revenue was $9.19
billion.
   UPSA "is an important company in France with its
over-the-counter market," Mr. Vietor said. "But it's not like
it's some European powerhouse."
   Still, Bristol-Myers's over-the-counter product line,
dominated by Excedrin, Bufferin and Nuprin pain relievers, is
concentrated in the U.S. and Canada, where the entire market
for such products has been sluggish in recent years and
buffeted by intense competition. The European
over-the-counter market "is underdeveloped and holds very
strong promise," said Viren Mehta, analyst with Mehta &amp;
Isely, New York, which tracks the international
pharmaceutical industry. "UPSA has a very good marketing
presence {in Europe}. This is a very attractive combination."
   Under terms of the agreement, which is subject to approval
of French authorities, Bristol-Myers will acquire a 33.56%
stake of UPSA and name three directors on a seven-member
board. It also has an option to acquire the entire company at
an undisclosed time, also assuming French government
approval. Nicole Bru, president and chief executive officer
of UPSA, will continue in those positions.
   A Bristol-Myers spokesman said the agreement will enable
UPSA to develop world-wide distribution of its product line,
which consists chiefly of powdered, effervescent pain
relievers and vitamins that are dissolved in water.
