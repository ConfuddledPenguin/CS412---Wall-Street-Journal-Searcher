   SALOU, Spain -- Out on the street of this middle-class
Costa Dorada resort town it doesn't look so bad. Salou's
three biggest beaches are chockablock with bronzed Spaniards
and sun-splotched German, British and Belgian families.
Open-air bars and restaurants dish out pizza, paella and
sangria at all hours.
   Yet Salou, like many of Spain's sun-and-surf destinations,
is having a crisis, both of business and of confidence. After
years of 5% to 7% increases in tourists and tourism income,
Catalonia's biggest beach resort is finding that more than
10% of its 210,000 tourist beds are going begging this
season. Although city fathers say the crisis is primarily due
to a 71% decline in British package tourists -- who normally
fill about 40% of the town's 30,000 hotel beds and 10% of its
170,000 holiday apartment beds -- they also cite a worrying
weakness in the German, Irish, Dutch and Belgian markets.

   "This is the worst year, the most difficult and irregular
year" since tourists began coming here in 1960, says Luis
Penalba, president of the town's association of tourist
apartments. Hotel and apartment occupancy was a third below
normal in May and June. Only in the past month, thanks to a
late surge of Spanish visitors and some price-cutting, did
hoteliers achieve the usual 90% to 95% occupancy -- for a few
weeks. Merchants say sales are off 50% or more from a year
ago.
   Salou has some specific troubles of its own, but many of
its woes mirror the general softening of tourist demand
throughout Spain. The downturn began last year when business
slumped an estimated 20% in the Canary Islands. In July,
Spain had 7% fewer tourists, compared with last year, and
tourist spending was off 22.5% in June, according to
government figures.
   For the first seven months of the year, overall visitors
were down 2.6%, with fewer Austrians, Belgians and Americans.
But the biggest blow has been an 18% drop this year in the
huge British market, Spain's third largest supplier of
foreign visitors, after France and Portugal.
   "It's not good to use the word crisis," says Felipe
Gaspart, secretary-general of Zontur, an association of
hotels in Spanish tourist areas. "But we are in a very
delicate position."
   As the season winds down to an unsatisfactory close, some
hotels in Andalusia are slashing prices 60% or more. More
than 30 hotels on the Costa del Sol probably will close
permanently at the end of the season, according to tourism
officials there.
   On Tenerife in the Canary Islands, one resort reportedly
ran out of cash this month to pay its workers, and two others
were repossessed by banks after the owners fell behind in
their interest payments. Worried entrepreneurs take this as a
portent. Local governments are sharply restricting the number
of hotels that can be built, and regional authorities are
talking about turning some older hotels into retirement
homes.
   To be sure, Spain has some bright spots. The total of
foreign visitors remains about flat this year, aided by a
boom in business travel. Although small in numbers, cultural
tourism to places such as Granada, Cordoba and Seville is up.
And the number of Japanese tourists, while minuscule, jumped
25% in the first half, a welcome development for five-star
hotels and ritzy boutiques. Finally, the 1992 Olympic Games
in Barcelona and the Expo '92 exposition in Seville should
give the industry a shot in the arm.
   But the backbone of Spain's mighty tourism business --
middle-class and working-class Europeans on two-week
inclusive holidays at the beach -- is weakening. Jane Shaw,
marketing manager for Air Tours, Manchester, England, could
be speaking about all Europeans when she says: "Our
holiday-makers have become more sophisticated. They're bored
with coastal Spain. They've been there several years running,
and they want to try something different."
   Familiarity breeds contempt, as do higher prices. The
strong Spanish peseta and 6.5% inflation have made Spain
costly for foreign visitors, especially those on limited
incomes who are most likely to come on package tours. The
strong peseta, says Mr. Gaspart of Zontur, "is our biggest
enemy."
   As a result, cheaper and more "exotic" destinations such
as Turkey, Tunisia and even the Caribbean are winning
sun-worshippers away from Spain, say tourism managers here.
   But the problems go deeper than that. Spain, the granddad
of package tourism, had about 35 million tourists last year
out of more than 54 million visitors. Over the years, the
country has built too many hotels and apartments, and more
are going up all the time. In the Balaeric Islands alone,
there is an estimated surplus of 30,000 to 40,000 hotel beds.
And much of the existing hotel stock is of the wrong sort.
"Twenty years ago, blocks of 14- and 15-story hotels went
up," says Tomas Navarro, a manager at Grupo Sol, Spain's
largest hotel company. "Nowadays, people want something
lower, with a garden."
   And visitors complain that service has deteriorated and
prices have increased.
   Madrid and the tourism ministries of Spain's autonomous
regional governments are struggling to upgrade the industry
and recast its image as not just sun and sand, but also
skiing, culture, gastronomy and areas off the beaten track.
   Esperanza Galiano Ramos, director of tourism policy for
the central government, says Madrid is offering low-interest
loans to hoteliers investing in new kitchens, telephone
systems, computers and the like. Ms. Galiano says some
regional authorities are taking legal steps to halt
construction of hotels aimed at low-income guests. Officials
also are planning a government survey of all hotels older
than five years. Those that don't invest and refurbish will
lose their stars. One official says 200 hostels in Barcelona
alone were closed for failing to meet higher standards.
   The federal budget for tourism promotion is up 11% this
year, and Madrid is giving the regions more money to promote
themselves.
   But it is infrastructure that Spain really needs. Money is
being poured into new highways, improved roads, cleaning of
beaches, sewage-treatment and water-purification plants and
airport expansions. Much of the expenditure is geared for the
Olympics and the Seville fair, but not all.
   Salou's special misfortunes stem directly from Spain's
poor infrastructure. In July 1989, seven British tourists
contracted typhoid fever here, probably from contaminated
drinking water. Because Salou is a popular destination for
Britons, the U.K. tabloid press went wild with the story.
They dubbed Salou "Typhoid Resort," and a rash of negative
stories followed.
   A few days after the typhoid news, there was a massive
rainstorm and flood.
   By then, the damage was done. British and Irish tour
operators began canceling room reservations here and later
cut charter flights. Package holiday bookings by air from the
U.K. to the Costa Dorada plunged more than 70%.
   Even with the water problem corrected, just about everyone
is hurting. Jordi Pamies, the owner of two shops that sell
porcelain figurines, says his revenue is down 56% from last
year, mainly on the decline in Britons. At Laura Bar, owner
Astrid Ribbelink says business is off 75%. "Last year, if you
didn't like somebody, you didn't serve them very well and
they never came back," she says. "Now you have to smile at
everybody. And you can't afford to turn away people who come
for dinner at 2 a.m."
