   LAFAYETTE, Calif. -- It's official. Domino's Pizza is just
too much of a potential safety hazard for downtown Lafayette,
in the opinion of its city council.
   The nation's biggest pizza chain has been under fire in
recent years because of traffic accidents, including a number
of fatal accidents, involving its pizza deliverers. Critics
charge that some of the accidents occurred because the
deliverers were rushing to fulfill the company's 30-minute
delivery guarantee. Domino's guarantees customers a $3 rebate
if delivery takes longer than 30 minutes.

   Lafayette, an affluent suburb east of San Francisco, is
the first city to refuse to grant a business license to a
Domino's franchisee because of the safety issue, according to
Domino's. A Domino's franchisee was seeking a license for a
location downtown within 100 feet of two nursery schools, a
senior citizens complex and a church.
   "We have no prejudice against them whatsoever, but we
think the site they chose would cause a potential safety
hazard," said Richard Holmes, Lafayette's mayor.
   "There's a little twist in each community you go into, but
we've never dealt with anyone as unreasonable as this," said
Dan Gearing, co-owner of the Domino's franchise.
   Domino's headquarters, in Detroit, says the deliverers'
accidents are the result of driving about 450 million miles a
year, delivering an estimated 275 million pizza pies in wind,
snow, sleet and rain. Domino's denies any connection between
the accidents -- about 100 last year -- and the company's
30-minute delivery guarantee. A company spokesman said he
isn't aware of a franchisee ever being turned down because of
the perception of poor driving habits. Domino's says it
encourages franchisees to provide instruction programs that
teach safe-driving techniques to Domino's drivers.
   The city did give Domino's a choice: waive the 30-minute
guarantee or relocate the business to the outskirts of town.
   Dolly's Pizza, formerly a Domino's is on the city's
fringe, and Cybelle's Pizza operates downtown. Each store
offers delivery service but neither promises 30-minute
delivery.
   But even if the Domino's franchisee waived the guarantee,
the city wanted to subject the business to stiff fines for
traffic violations, starting at $250 for the first offense,
moving up to $1,000 for the fourth offense. The fourth
offense would also give Lafayette the right to revoke the
franchisee's business license.
   Mr. Gearing said he and his partner will confer with
Domino's regional office before taking any further action.
Mr. Gearing's attorney, Donn Black, thinks there could be a
hidden agenda here: the city council may feel Domino's isn't
upscale enough for downtown Lafayette.
   Aldine Koreneff, director of the nearby nursery, has made
her feelings known. Not only does she fear for the safety of
her charges, she adds, "I don't even like Domino's Pizza."
