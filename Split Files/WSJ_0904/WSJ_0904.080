   HONG KONG -- Opening arguments began Monday in the closely
watched corruption trial of former Hong Kong Stock Exchange
chairman Ronald Li, which prosecutors expect to last six
weeks.
   Mr. Li, 61 years old, pleaded innocent last week to two
counts of accepting preferential offerings of shares in
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., and Novel Enterprises Ltd. in
1986 and 1987, in exchange for helping to obtain listings for
the companies' shares.

   The former official, who is free on HK$12 million bail
(US$1.6 million), faces a maximum penalty of seven years in
prison and HK$500,000 in fines on each count.
   Mr. Li and six other former bourse officials, including
his son Alfred, will be jointly tried in February on six
similar corruption charges. A string of other counts were
dismissed in separate actions earlier this year.
