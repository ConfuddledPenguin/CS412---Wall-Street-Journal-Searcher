   SKOKIE, Ill. -- Two years ago, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
undertook a crash program to stop the flow of red ink at its
famous catalog operation. It cut costs sharply and improved
service. It began taking orders over toll-free telephone
lines and selling some European-style clothes.
   So far, that hasn't been enough. The Sears catalog, with
annual sales of about $4 billion, hasn't made money since
1985. If it doesn't turn a profit soon, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
may be forced to close the catalog that once set America's
standard of living.

   For now, Sears is doing all it can to stay in the catalog
business. But last month, Sears Chairman Edward Brennan took
control of the company's faltering merchandise group and
vowed to improve profits. He is expected to slash expenses
and eliminate unproductive businesses. Catalog unit managers
"know they're on a short fuse," says one person close to the
company. Sears "has to exit businesses that don't perform,"
says another.
   Vern Page, the catalog unit's vice president, insists that
a turnaround is imminent -- and only slightly behind
schedule. Next year, he predicts, the catalog will be solidly
in the black.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Brennan stops short of making promises
about the catalog's future. "We conducted an intensive review
of our catalog operation in 1988 and decided to stay in the
business and to address our problems more aggressively," he
says through a spokesman. "We have had significant
improvement since then and the challenge now is to build on
that momentum."
   Sears would clearly prefer to keep the catalog, but the
fact that its fate is in question at all underscores the
depth of soul-searching now going on at Sears. Two years ago,
the giant retailing and financial services company seriously
considered closing the catalog but decided to give it one
last chance.
   The changes have been sweeping. The catalog business is
now a separate unit with its own management team. Its
offerings have been trimmed by a third, and distribution
costs have been cut sharply. The catalog also is satisfying
more customers, filling more than 97% of its orders, compared
with 92% in the early 1980s.
   The question remains, however, whether the changes came
too late. With store sales stagnant and profits depressed,
the catalog may not be sacred anymore.
   Still, traditions run deep at Sears -- and the mail-order
business dates back to the company's founding in 1886. That's
when Richard Sears started peddling watches through the mail
from an office in Minneapolis.
   Mr. Sears's promotional pitches still reverberate in some
corners of the black steel and glass Sears Tower in Chicago.
With the words "Send No Money" and a request for payment on
inspection, he persuaded skeptical rural Americans to try his
ever-expanding selection of goods. His slogan didn't hurt
either. He called his company the "cheapest supply house on
Earth."
   Sears hawked the latest in everything: silverware,
clothing, pistols, sewing machines, bicycles, and musical
instruments. Thomas Edison's windup phonograph known as a
"Talking Machine," made its debut in the big book. Sears even
sold cars and houses through the mail.
   Perusing the pages of the Sears catalog soon became a
popular pastime. "The Sears catalog was next to the Bible in
American homes," says retail analyst Walter Loeb.
   By the 1980s, however, the Sears catalog had lost touch
with American tastes and shopping habits. Specialty catalogs
were growing rapidly by catering to busy working women. These
catalogs offered a limited selection of merchandise and made
shopping easy by taking orders round-the-clock on toll-free
telephone lines. Even the dowdy Spiegel catalog was becoming
a stylish, shopper-friendly book.
   But Sears continued to do business the old way. It spit
out catalogs as thick as telephone books and received orders
by mail or at its 3,000 catalog offices. Despite the high
cost of operating these offices and the fact that catalog
shopping was becoming a strictly at-home affair, Sears
continued to tout them as a customer "convenience." The
company kept operating a network of inefficient warehouses
employing 12,000 people. It also stuck to traditional styles,
ignoring the changing tastes of young shoppers.
   Sears doesn't disclose catalog results. Analysts'
estimates, which vary widely, put the operation's losses at
$170 million -- or more -- in the past two years. Sears
officials won't comment. But the company's accounting methods
were so confusing that not even its own executives knew until
1988 how bad things were.
   That's when Sears got serious about reviving the business.
The newly created catalog unit got its own profit and loss
statement and its own headquarters in a two-story brick
building in this Chicago suburb.
   The catalog unit managers axed 83,000 unproductive items,
or a third of the catalog's inventory, including coats and
other clothing styles that customers frequently returned. As
a result, the dollar value of returned merchandise fell 12%
last year, the first such drop in recent memory.
   Managers also closed seven warehouses, eliminating the
jobs of more than half of the catalog's distribution staff.
And they sold unprofitable catalog offices in small towns to
management.
   They also started listening to the catalog's 30 million
customers. They split the big book in half, devoting one
catalog to apparel and the other to home furnishings. They
added a table of contents, more stylish goods and, of course,
the toll-free phone number.
   But Sears may have done too little too late. Its catalogs
still look cluttered and dull compared with most specialty
books. And its big Christmas catalog still hawks everything
from washing machines priced at $399.88 to Teen-Age Mutant
Ninja Turtle raincoats for $6.99.
   What's more, catalog sales growth is slowing and industry
sales could soften further if a recession develops. Even
highly efficient competitors such as Lands' End Inc., which
sailed through the 1980s with big sales and profit gains, are
running into trouble now. Lands' End, in fact, just reported
a $2.2 million loss for its fiscal second quarter.
   Mr. Page, the Sears catalog vice president, acknowledges
that the outlook is worsening. Sears may have to stimulate
business early next year by offering special promotions at
local catalog offices, he says. But, he insists, "We feel
we're right on target with the three- or four-year turnaround
program we worked out."
