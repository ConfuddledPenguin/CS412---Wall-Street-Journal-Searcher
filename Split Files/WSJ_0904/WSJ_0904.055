   MOSCOW -- Earlier this year, the wife of Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov told an interviewer that being prime
minister is not something her husband wants to do forever. As
a realist, he understands he will have to step down "sooner
or later," she said.
   Now, it looks like sooner is arriving. After more than a
year of patiently preparing and revising plans to overhaul
the Soviet economy, Mr. Ryzhkov's political future has been
thrown into doubt by two of the pushiest people in Soviet
politics, President Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, the
head of the Russian republic.

   Frustrated by the prime minister's timid approach to
economic reform, the two men seem on the verge of jettisoning
most of the Ryzhkov proposals in favor of a more radical plan
worked out by their own advisers. Known as the Shatalin plan,
after Stanislav Shatalin, an economist close to Mr. Gorbachev
who drafted it in less than one month, it seeks to halt the
Soviet economy's slide over the next six months and then
introduce sweeping measures such as large-scale privatization
to establish a market economy.
   The plan was presented to a meeting of Soviet leaders
Friday, and will be examined this week by the nation's 15
constituent republics. Depending on their verdict, the
package will be submitted for approval to the national
Parliament as early as next week.
   In public, Mr. Gorbachev still defends his prime minister
and holds out hope that elements of the Shatalin and Ryzhkov
plans can be fused into one coherent whole. But he conceded
at a news conference that it will be hard to bridge the huge
differences between the two plans, which are at odds over
such key areas as prices, taxes, the budget and the measures
needed to stabilize the economy.
   Mr. Yeltsin is more blunt. Over the weekend he called for
the resignation of Mr. Ryzhkov and his government, saying
that this was a key condition for the successful
implementation of economic reform. "You cannot mate a
hedgehog and a snake," Mr. Yeltsin told journalists. "You
cannot mix the Shatalin plan and the program drawn up by the
union government."
   Judging by details of the two programs announced yesterday
by Ivan Silayev, the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Yeltsin's
contention seems correct. Mr. Silayev told the Russian
Parliament that the Shatalin plan would immediately hand over
management of the economy to the nation's constituent
republics, who would themselves decide which powers to cede
to union authorities. One result would be the liquidation of
almost all Soviet ministries next year, Mr. Silayev said. Mr.
Ryzhkov, on the other hand, would keep the present
centralized structure more or less intact until a new union
treaty was signed sometime in the future.
   On the key question of reforming the Soviet price system,
Mr. Shatalin's plan foresees freezing the prices of basic
necessities and allowing all other prices to begin floating
freely, set by supply and demand. Mr. Ryzhkov, however, wants
to continue the system of government-fixed prices, raising
them substantially to reduce the budget deficit. Only in 1992
would he start allowing some prices to float freely.
   Mr. Silayev clearly endorsed the Shatalin plan, which he
helped to draft. Most other republics are considered likely
to follow suit.
   Mr. Ryzhkov thus finds himself faced with a bleak choice:
either he resigns or is fired, or else he must introduce and
implement an economic reform that bears scant resemblance to
his own proposals. The betting in Moscow is that he will try
to salvage some personal dignity by stepping down.
   A smooth technocrat from the Ural mountains, Mr. Ryzhkov
became prime minister in September 1985 after a long career
in industry, working his way up from a lowly engineer, to
managing director, to politician. His background in industry
and his work with the State Planning Committee has left him
with a continuing belief in the virtues of central planning,
and he appears only lukewarm about the idea of a market
economy -- a halfheartedness that is now costing him dear.
   Lacking the charisma of Mr. Gorbachev, he was constantly
overshadowed by his boss until the Armenian earthquake in
December 1988. He immediately rushed to the site to organize
rescue operations, and frequently was shown on TV comforting
the survivors. At the time, one Soviet commentator remarked
that many had thought him soft and irresolute. But in the
aftermath of the earthquake, "the world then saw another
man," the commentator said. "The mask of reservation fell to
reveal frankness and undisguised passionate pity."
   During his five years as prime minister, he has reduced
sharply the number of government ministries and actively
promoted joint ventures with Western companies, personally
meeting and encouraging dozens of foreign businessmen. But he
has faced growing public criticism over his handling of the
Soviet economy, his main task.
   The criticism started in earnest last December, when he
presented Parliament with a traditional economic package for
the coming five years. It ignored the advice of his own more
radical advisers and relied heavily on continued economic
management by Moscow bureaucrats. The rapid deterioration of
the economy and growing shortages of basic goods soon
increased the pressure for more sweeping change. Mr.
Gorbachev this year ordered a revision, calling for the
introduction of a full-fledged market economy.
   Mr. Ryzhkov struggled in vain to comply. The new plans he
outlined in May provoked only anger and criticism. His
attempt to raise prices of many consumer goods sparked
panic-buying throughout the nation, and was later termed
"absurd" by Mr. Gorbachev himself. Radical economists
complained that the plans weren't market-oriented, and the
Soviet Parliament told him to revise the proposals by this
month.
   The prime minister is irked by the criticism. "I can't say
that I'm getting used to it," he told the Sovietskaya Rossiya
daily this year. "I've never been weak, but I've never been a
petty tyrant either."
