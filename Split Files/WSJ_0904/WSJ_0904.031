   NEW YORK -- The multibillionnaire Tisch family, taking
advantage of the massacre in bank stocks, is pouring more
money into shares of banking companies.
   A Tisch family company, FLF Associates, disclosed Friday
that it recently acquired 9.5% of BayBanks Inc., 5.6% of
Continental Bank Corp. and 6.8% of Equimark Corp. All three
stocks jumped on the news, but FLF said it bought the stocks
"for investment reasons," indicating it doesn't have takeover
intentions.

   These investments follow a Tisch foray last December into
Bank of Boston stock, which has since lost half its value.
Although members of the Tisch family don't always make good
investment calls, they made their fortune -- estimated at
more than $2 billion -- by buying when others were selling.
   "The trick is to buy stocks when they're trading like they
have cancer," says someone close to Thomas Tisch, who runs
FLF, a pool of money for Thomas and three brothers who are
the sons of CBS Inc.'s chief Laurence Tisch.
   At FLF, Thomas Tisch declines to comment. He is said to be
aware that he started investing in banks too soon but
believes that he has the luxury of waiting out the storm. He
didn't buy bank stocks with borrowed funds, which can be
risky. And he's apparently willing to wait several years for
his bets to pay off.
   In the investment world, any move by the Tisch family is
closely watched. They built their fortune initially through
resorts and hotels, then bought and sold Loews Theatres Inc.
Later they diversified into tobacco, insurance, hotels and
Bulova Watch, now under the umbrella of Loews Corp. In 1986,
Laurence Tisch gained control of CBS after buying only 25% of
the stock.
   However, the Tisch family missed most of the 1980s bull
market in stocks. And now, some investor say, owning bank
stocks before the industry's travails are over could be
hair-raising. "I think the Tisches are too early," says New
York money manager Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta/Sosnoff
Capital.
   He thinks bank stocks could be rocky for the next year as
banks own up to more big losses on risky corporate and real
estate loans and credit cards. Like many people, he thinks
some banks will be forced to cut their dividends to buttress
their capital.
   In addition to the three bank holdings disclosed Friday,
FLF owns almost 9% of Bank of Boston and a stake in First
Interstate Iowa, and is said to own shares in other banks as
well. Friday's filings were made by a group including FLF --
which stands for Four Lucky Fellows -- as well as Laurence
and his brother, Preston Tisch.
   There has been speculation that Loews Corp., the Tisch
flagship company, also has been investing heavily in banks
such as Chase Manhattan Corp. Some people close to the Tisch
family estimate that the combined bank holdings in FLF and
Loews now are approaching $500 million, with big and small
stakes in 10 or more regional and money center concerns.
   At CBS, Mr. Tisch says those numbers sound "a bit
exaggerated." He referred all questions to his sons, saying,
"I don't get involved too much in bank investments. I spend
my time at CBS," though nobody believes he has taken his eye
off the ball at FLF and Loews. Mr. Tisch's sons declined to
comment.
   So far, FLF hasn't fared well with its bank shares. The
Bank of Boston stake that FLF started building last December
-- representing an investment of more than $100 million --
now is valued at roughly half that.
   Meanwhile, in the portfolios of Loews's insurance
companies, an additional $150 million of common shares of
financial concerns held since last year is apparently in the
red, too. These older holdings are said to include a big
block of Chemical Banking, bought in the low 30s. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Chemical was at
$21.625 a share, up 50 cents.
   However, the Tisch family doesn't appear to be troubled by
such reversals. They have enormous cash resources and often
hold investments for many years. In recent years, they made
bets that proved to be prescient on oil tankers and drilling
rigs.
   Shares of Loews and its 25%-owned CBS have fallen in the
past year, but Wall Street professionals believe that Mr.
Tisch will one day sell all or part of those companies at a
big profit.
   Meanwhile, many traders have made a lot of money betting
against bank stocks. This year the bank stocks in the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index have fallen 30%. Bank of Boston,
which FLF mostly bought last December at around $20, closed
Friday at $8.75 a share, up 50 cents. (FLF acquired a smaller
stake in August at about $10 a share.) Some traders believe
New England bank stocks have farther to fall because of the
region's weak real estate markets.
   Marc Perkins of Perkins Smith in Florida, an analyst and
money manager who advises Thomas Tisch on some of his bank
investments, believes that such strong New England banks as
BayBanks and Bank of Boston will survive their problems with
their capital intact. In two or three years, he predicts,
Bank of Boston stock will have more than tripled, to about
30.
   Mr. Perkins expects bank stocks to suffer for another
year. Currently, he thinks some debt securities issued by
banks offer better value than common shares; for instance, he
and his clients own Bank of Boston floating-rate notes,
yielding about 18%. But he believes that stock-market
investors generally are misreading the problems in the
banking industry. Many banks were far more troubled during
the 1974 recession than they are now, he says, yet they
managed to turn themselves around.
   Banks stocks "are starting to look very cheap," he says.
"They're trading like they were going out of business."
   Equimark, which has traded as high as $12.625 in the past
year, closed Friday at $5.625, up $1. The Friday filings show
the Tisches hold 804,700 Equimark shares, including 425,500
purchased in July and August at $3.375 to $5.625 apiece.
   Michael Jehle, Equimark's chief financial officer, said
that the Tisches have been Equimark shareholders for some
time before this filing, and that they call periodically to
ask about the company's financial condition. The Pittsburgh
bank holding company, reeling from bad real estate and
consumer credit loans, had a first-half loss of $45.2 million
before one-time gains. Federal regulators now are
investigating expenses Equimark charged the government while
managing an insolvent Texas bank. Equimark's agreement to
acquire that bank, National Bancshares Corp. of Texas,
eventually collapsed, prompting Equimark to lay off several
top executives and two dozen senior and midlevel managers.
   In Boston, Baybanks declined to comment. Tisch holdings
were listed as 1,520,000 shares, including 1,346,000 bought
in the last two months for $11.25 to $16 apiece. The stock
closed Friday at $13.50, up 75 cents. The Tisches said they
may seek Federal Reserve Board approval to acquire additional
shares.
   At Continental Bank, the Tisch group said it holds
2,804,600 shares, including 1,036,500 bought Aug. 1 to Aug.
23 for $8.75 to $11.75 each. The stock rose 75 cents Friday,
to $10.875.
   A Continental Bank spokesman said Friday: "We're
delighted" by the Tisches' investment. "We were aware of
their interest." He wouldn't elaborate.
   It's understood, however, that the Tisches were part of a
group including some Continental Bank managers who tried to
buy the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s remaining 26% stake
in the company last June. The FDIC declined the bid of around
$15 a share. The FDIC rebuffed a separate proposal last fall
to let Continental sell the stake in a public offering when
the shares were around $20. In the past 12 months, the stock
has traded as high as $26.625.
   Continental is trading at less than half its book value of
about $23 a share. On an operating basis, Continental
essentially broke even in the second quarter, but it posted a
net loss of $56.7 million after a big charge for 900 layoffs.
Further cost cutting may be required. Continental has been
highly dependent on leveraged buy-outs and other financings
that have slowed in recent months.
