   Despite Iraq's muted overtures to negotiate its way out of
the crisis in the Persian Gulf, oil strategists continue to
calculate the potential impact of war on that fertile
crescent of energy.
   Their focus: Saudi Arabia's oil production, which experts
deem to be the difference between adequate or short global
petroleum supplies. Crucial to world-wide energy security is
the Saudi pledge to boost production by two million barrels
daily, an action that will make up half of the output lost to
the Iraq-Kuwait embargo.

   Even with that additional production, "the oil market is
very tight, with no slack," says John Lichtblau, chairman of
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "If anything
technical goes wrong elsewhere in the world, there will be a
shortage."
   Industry experts say the big worry in any military faceoff
isn't only that an Iraqi strike would knock out Saudi oil
fields. It is the potential immobilization of Ras Tanura,
Saudi Arabia's primary export facility on the Persian Gulf.
According to one executive familiar with the port, equipment
there is densely situated and vulnerable. And with Ras Tanura
crippled, the Saudis would be hard put to export as much as
half of the 7.5 million barrels of daily production they have
promised.
   "If four million barrels out of Ras Tanura is lost, the
world is in bad shape," says one high-ranking oil executive.
"We'd have to turn to inventory; in the U.S., to the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
   So far, most oil experts believe that the Saudis, backed
by the U.S., would have adequate warning of an Iraqi strike,
as well as the capability of shooting down attacking missiles
or aircraft. "Anti-missile systems have been put in place and
AWACs {special radar aircraft} are in the air," says one oil
executive.
   But strategists still ponder alternatives. The Saudis
could boost exports via pipeline to the Red Sea port of Yanbu
to 3.2 million barrels a day from current 1.5 million
barrels. That pipeline, experts say, is underused because it
is cheaper to export oil through the Persian Gulf on tankers.
   If the loading wharves at Ras Tanura were put out of
action, oil industry officials also say tankers could still
take on oil from low-lying Sea Island facilities constructed
almost 1.5 miles offshore the port. "They don't have much
mass, so they'd be harder to hit" than onshore facilities,
says one expert.
   It hasn't been easy for combatants in the past to shut
down fully Persian Gulf oil shipping. Iraq couldn't seem to
incapacitate Kharg Island, Iran's primary export facility,
during their bitter eight-year war. Despite repeated
airstrikes on loading facilities there, Iran was able to keep
oil moving by feverishly rebuilding after each hit.
   And many independent tankers, scared away from Kharg by
the high risk of attack, filled up on Iranian crude at Lavan
and Sirri Islands in the southern tip of the Persian Gulf. To
move the oil to those islands, the Iranians created their own
shuttle of tankers -- some with highly paid commandos on
board whose sole mission was to save cargo and crew in case
of attack.
   In the current crisis, the heavy presence of naval vessels
in the Gulf is expected to lessen the peril to shipping and
make closure of the Strait of Hormuz improbable.
   "If fighting breaks out, we don't envision any major
disruptions to other OPEC producers" in the Persian Gulf or
elsewhere, says Brice A. Sachs, principal with International
Energy Consultants Ltd. and a former Exxon executive. Output
from Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iran and even tiny
Bahrain should continue unimpeded, experts say, though they
note those producers couldn't replace Saudi barrels that
might be lost to a war.
   However, attacks on production or export facilities of
Saudi Arabia would probably drive oil prices to $40 a barrel
within days, oil industry executives say privately. Refiners
heavily dependent on Middle Eastern production, such as Star
Enterprises, Texaco Inc.'s joint venture with the Saudis,
would be especially vulnerable.
   In theory, the impact should be delayed. Middle East oil,
known within industry circles as "long-haul" crude, can take
as many as six weeks to reach the U.S. Thus it should take
that long before a supply pinch is felt. But in a market so
driven by psychology, perception of a shortage is all it
would take to tighten supplies and drive up prices. Hoarding
would undoubtedly take most, if not all, surplus barrels off
the market immediately.
   Even without any loss of Saudi production, crude-oil
supplies are expected to tighten as winter demand picks up.
"By October, the world will be demanding more oil than it can
supply," with much of the current inventory overhang pared
away, says John Redpath, analyst for Energy Security Analysis
Inc.
   Analysts predict that the one-million-barrel daily
production shortfall anticipated in the months ahead will
grow to two million barrels as energy needs increase in cold
weather. The only way out of that, says Tom Burns, manager of
economics for Chevron Corp., will be for higher oil prices to
damp demand and reduce consumption.
   Already, in efforts to secure sufficient oil supplies,
some major U.S. refiners are trying to squeeze extra barrels
from producing countries with which they already have supply
contracts. All potential sources of additional supplies are
currently being examined. The trading room at one of the
nation's largest oil companies has at times been operating on
a 24-hour basis to ensure that enough crude supplies will be
available.
   Actual oil supplies aren't yet short, experts say. And the
Paris-based International Energy Agency says it will take a
shortage of 7% before a so-called sharing agreement among its
members goes into effect. That plan, once activated, will
call upon most of the industrialized world to uniformly draw
down inventories and cut consumption, possibly through
rationing.
