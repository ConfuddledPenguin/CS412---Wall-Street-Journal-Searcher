   FRANKFURT -- Axel Springer Verlag said first-half net
income rose 7% to 60 million Deutsche marks ($38.3 million).
   The Hamburg, West Germany, publisher didn't provide
comparable figures for the year-earlier period. The company
said it achieved the results despite its cooperative ventures
in East Germany, which the company said demanded considerable
expenses.

   The company said it expects the positive earnings
developments to continue in the second half. The company
publishes West Germany's largest mass circulation tabloid
newspaper, Bild.
   Sales rose 14% to 1.67 billion marks, with all of the
company's sectors contributing to the increase.
   Newspapers sales rose 83 million marks to 369 million
marks, while magazine sales climbed 34 million marks to 369
million marks.
   Springer, which has about 11,800 employees, invested about
102 million marks in the first half.
