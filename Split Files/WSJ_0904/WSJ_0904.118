   Pan American World Airways said it agreed to phase out
some of its Berlin flights and provide planes for Lufthansa
German Airlines' planned Berlin operations.
   Lufthansa has applied for permission to serve Berlin
beginning in October. Under its "agreement in principle" with
Pan Am, a unit of Pan Am Corp., Lufthansa will pay Pan Am
$150 million to lease at least nine Pan Am Boeing Co. 727
aircraft, with pilots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am, which currently operates 74 daily flights between
Berlin and the German cities of Hamburg, Nuremburg,
Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Munich, will terminate
those services in late October. The agreement does not affect
Pan Am's non-stop service to Berlin from New York or the
operations of Pan Am Express, its regional airline
subsidiary, which operates 34 daily flights to 10 European
cities and Berlin.

   PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS expects to receive $150 million
from Lufthansa German Airlines for certain services and
facilities, including the transfer of gate space. Tuesday's
edition incorrectly described what Pan American was selling.
