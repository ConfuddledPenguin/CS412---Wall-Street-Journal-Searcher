   AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co., a producer of polyvinyl
chloride, specialty chemicals and aircraft parts and
services, said it completed the sale of its off-highway
braking systems business to Carlisle Cos., Syracuse, N.Y.,
which produces single-ply roofing, computer tape, specialty
wire and cable, and other products, including brake parts.
Terms weren't disclosed.
   The Goodrich unit produces brakes for construction, mining
and other off-highway vehicles, and had 1989 sales of $47
million. Goodrich said the sale won't have a significant
effect on its 1990 profit. Goodrich's sales last year were
$2.4 billion.
