   As an increasing number of colleges adopt regulations to
deal with incidents of ethnic, racial and homosexual
harassment, controversy is brewing over whether the new rules
violate students' First Amendment rights to free speech.
   Efforts to stem discriminatory behavior and speech on
campus are coming under fire by legal groups, students and
professors as violating free expression guaranteed by the
Constitution, says David S. Tatel of the Washington law firm
Hogan &amp; Hartson.

   Last year, a federal court struck down as unconstitutional
an anti-harassment rule adopted by the University of
Michigan. The university has since worked with the American
Civil Liberties Union affiliate that represented the
plaintiffs in drafting a new interim policy that is more
narrow, said Walter Harrison, executive director of
university relations at the University of Michigan.
   "We're really mapping out new ground in trying to protect
the free expression essential to higher education and at the
same time providing a hospitable environment for a student
body that's increasingly diverse," said Mr. Harrison.
   Since 1987, incidents of racial, ethnic and homosexual
harassment have occurred on more than 300 college campuses,
according to the National Institute Against Prejudice and
Violence, a Baltimore-based research organization. The
organization said that between 800,000 and one million
minority students are involved in such incidents every school
year.
   "The First Amendment issue has to be seen in the larger
framework of those figures," said Robert Purvis, legal
director of the National Institute. "Some of the First
Amendment values are operating at the expense of minorities."
   Exceptions to First Amendment protections are very limited
and include some defamatory speech and obscenity. Many
schools have based their anti-harassment policies on a 1942
U.S. Supreme Court decision that found that "fighting words"
that inflict injury or tend to incite immediate violence
aren't protected by the First Amendment.
   But Nadine Strossen, general counsel for the ACLU, said
that in order to be held constitutional the rules "would have
to be so narrow that they wouldn't apply to any of the
underlying incidents that gave rise to the desire for
regulations in the first place." And Ms. Strossen worries
that the rules will ultimately be used to silence the very
students they were designed to protect.
   Nonetheless, proponents say the regulations have made a
difference on campus. "We still have ugly things happen. But
because of the rule people are less inclined to do outrageous
things," said James Sulton, special assistant to the
president for minority affairs at the University of
Wisconsin, which adopted an anti-harassment policy last year.
   Mr. Sulton said the university worked with three law
professors in order to craft a policy that could withstand
court challenges. The results of those efforts are now being
tested. In March, a group of students, an instructor and a
student newspaper represented by the Wisconsin affiliate of
the ACLU filed suit against the school's board of regents,
alleging that the policy restricts free speech and violates
constitutional protections. The case is pending.

   SMOKING LIABILITY case is set to make its third appearance
in court.
   The closely watched case, Horton vs. American Tobacco Co.,
is scheduled to begin today in Lafayette County Circuit Court
in Oxford, Miss. The case originally went to trial in January
1988 in Lexington, Miss.
   Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor, died of lung
cancer in 1987. His family charged American Tobacco with
"marketing a defective and unreasonably dangerous product."
   American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied
any responsibility for Mr. Horton's death, but the case has
raised hopes among anti-smoking forces. Mississippi state law
is more favorable to plaintiffs than most other states. Under
its so-called comparative-negligence law, the jury could have
awarded damages to the Horton family even if it had found the
tobacco company bore only 1% of the responsibility for Mr.
Horton's death.
   The first trial, however, ended in a hung jury amid
charges of jury tampering. A second trial began last April,
but complaints made by American Tobacco prompted Circuit
Court Judge Eugene Bogen to halt the proceedings. Before the
trial began, newspapers, broadcasters and local civic and
political leaders had received a packet of information from
the plaintiffs' attorneys that included statements that
tobacco companies were targeting blacks and other minorities
in their marketing efforts.
   Judge Bogen, in approving a motion by American Tobacco for
a delay in the case and a change of venue, characterized the
statements as a "blatant attempt to make an appeal on the
basis of race to the persons in Holmes County, and thus
indirectly on the jury pool."
   The judge also placed a gag order on all parties. "He may
not change his order until the jury comes back," said Mike
Davis, an attorney in the Austin, Texas, firm of Byrd, Davis
&amp; Eisenberg, which is helping to represent the Horton family.
"But we'll have a lot to say about this case then."
   An American Brands spokesman said the company doesn't
comment on litigation.

   A JUDGE CUT an award against Alexander &amp; Alexander
Services Inc.
   The punitive damage award was reduced from $40 million to
$12.5 million. It had been granted by a jury in Baltimore
City Circuit Court to a local broker who had accused the big
New York-based insurance brokerage firm of conspiring to
replace it as the insurance representative for a local
hospital. The award, granted in May, was believed to be one
of the largest ever in a dispute between insurance brokerage
firms over a client relationship.
   At a hearing early last week, Judge Meyer Cardin let the
verdict against Alexander &amp; Alexander Services stand, but
indicated that the award was too high, according to an
attorney who attended the hearing. Judge Cardin signed the
order Friday.
   B. Dixon Evander &amp; Associates, the Baltimore broker, also
alleged that Alexander had conspired to refuse to pay Dixon
Evander commissions due on a policy for the University of
Maryland Hospital that Dixon Evander had arranged. Alexander
and two other defendants in the case also were ordered to pay
compensatory damages totaling $644,016.
   The judge didn't grant Alexander's request for a new
trial. William W. Cahill, Alexander's trial attorney, said
the brokerage firm will appeal the judgment.

   $100.3 MILLION JUDGMENT in Texas prison overcrowding case
to be appealed.
   A state judge in Austin concluded that the state of Texas
owes the money to 12 counties that held prisoners who
couldn't be housed in already-jammed state facilities. The
total is based on Judge Joseph Hart's decision that the state
must pay $40 a day for the care of each prisoner the county
holds more than seven days. The ruling covers a period from
Sept. 28, 1987 through Feb. 28 of this year.
   Litigation involving cramped state prisons isn't uncommon,
but the size of the judgment in the Texas case is unusual,
says Ann Clarke Snell, an attorney with the Austin firm
Bickerstaff, Heath &amp; Smiley, counsel for 11 of the counties.
But Robert Ozer, an assistant attorney general in Texas,
argues there isn't any statutory authority for the judge's
ruling, and that it undermines legislation aimed at diverting
inmates from overcrowded state prisons.
   "Now counties will be able to crowd local jails and get
paid $40 a day for doing it," says Mr. Ozer.

   BORDEN ACCUSES Japanese dairy company of trademark
infringement.
   For seven years, Borden Inc. and Meiji Milk Products Co.
of Tokyo have been partners in a venture to make and sell
margarine products in Japan under Borden trademarks. Now, as
the licensing agreement is about to expire, Borden has filed
a lawsuit accusing Meiji of proposing its own products using
packaging confusingly similar to Borden's.
   In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Borden
said the Meiji packaging will mislead Japanese consumers. The
suit said the packaging is nearly identical to that of the
Borden-licensed product, except that the Borden logo is
replaced.
   "Meiji is proposing identical packaging and trade dress
for margarine products in direct competition with other
Borden margarine products," the suit said. "Meiji is
intending to substitute its margarine products for the Borden
margarine products on the shelves of the retail outlets
throughout Japan."
   The suit asks the court to prohibit Meiji from
distributing or marketing the products. It was filed in
Manhattan because the licensing agreement is governed by New
York and U.S. law.
   Meiji officials couldn't be reached for comment.
