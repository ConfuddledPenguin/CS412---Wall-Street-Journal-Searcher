   First Ameri-Cable Corp., a cable television company based
in Columbus, Ohio, said that it sold substantially all of its
assets to TCI Holdings Inc., a Denver-based cable TV concern,
for about $40 million, and that it will distribute net
proceeds to shareholders.
   The company said it intends to distribute on about Sept.
17 at least 15 cents a share to stock of record Sept. 11.
First Ameri-Cable has about 54 million shares outstanding.

   An additional distribution of as much as three cents a
share will be made in March 1992, the company said. That
payment will be made from an escrow fund of $1.6 million that
the company established to provide for certain post-closing
obligations and any breaches of contractual representations
or warranties.
