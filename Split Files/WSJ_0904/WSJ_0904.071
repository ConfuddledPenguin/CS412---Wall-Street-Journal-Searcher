   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- There are grapes, and then there are
grapes.
   And according to the U.S. government, grape dealers better
know the differences among varieties.

   To make its point, a U.S. attorney in California indicted
Michael Licciardi of Stockton, Calif., for misrepresenting to
two wineries at least 1,600 tons of "relatively common
grapes" as expensive Zinfandel grapes. The indictment, which
alleges 11 felony crimes, charges that about 300,000 gallons
of wine was produced from these grapes with a value of about
$6 million.
   David F. Levi, a U.S. attorney, said the indictment was
the second in a "continuing investigation . . . of fraud in
the California wine industry." A similar indictment was filed
last month against two Escalon, Calif., grape dealers for
misrepresenting about 6,500 tons of grapes to California
wineries.
   Mr. Licciardi could not be reached for comment. If
convicted of all charges, he faces up to 55 years in prison
and as much as $2,750,000 in fines, according to the U.S.
Justice Department.
