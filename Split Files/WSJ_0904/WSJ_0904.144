   ALBANY, N.Y. -- The New York State Public Service
Commission approved a three-year rate increase for Orange &amp;
Rockland Utilities Inc. that requires the Pearl River,
N.Y.-based utility to offer energy-saving programs to its
180,000 customers.
   The utility, which had asked for a $22.5 million, or 5.8%,
increase, will receive an increase of about $10.5 million, or
2.7%, for the first year. But in an unusual arrangement, the
increases for the next two years will be tied to the
company's success at improving energy efficiency and
providing energy-saving programs for customers.

   Traditionally utilities have increased profits by selling
more power, but "this new agreement separates company profits
from sales," says Laurence DeWitt, head of the commission's
energy efficiency and environmental programs. Now "profits
will be tied to the utility's performance in helping its
customers be more energy efficient," he said.
   Under the agreement, Orange &amp; Rockland will install
energy-saving devices free of charge for many of its
residential and commercial customers beginning in January. It
also will provide rebates to customers who install various
energy-saving devices such as high-efficiency motors and
non-electrically driven cooling systems.
   "The purpose of the program is to reduce the total energy
costs of both residential and business consumers," Mr. DeWitt
said. Consumers who participate in these programs are
expected to see a reduction of 2% to 10% in their monthly
bills.
