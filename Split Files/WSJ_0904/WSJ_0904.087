   PARIS -- The International Energy Agency expects oil
supplies to remain adequate through October despite the
Middle East crisis and then to tighten as winter approaches.
   Agency officials don't look for the supply crunch to be
big enough to trigger the 21-member agency's oil-sharing
agreement, which would call for drawdowns of government oil
stockpiles and other emergency measures, until late in the
fourth quarter, if then.

   "We are going to have to watch the second half of the
fourth quarter very carefully {when} we could face a market
tightening and possibly the physical problem that the IEA was
designed to cope with," said George Quincy Lumsden Jr.,
director of oil markets development.
   The governing board of the Paris-based agency met Friday
to consider possible responses to the oil-supply situation
created by global sanctions against Iraq, which have removed
an estimated 4.3 million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude
from world oil markets. After the meeting, as expected, the
agency reported it had found oil markets are "generally well
supplied" and that emergency-sharing measures aren't needed
now.
   "Should the situation require it," the agency said, "the
IEA will immediately take whatever emergency action is
needed, including co-ordinated use of public and
government-controlled stocks and further demand restraint."
   The agency cited several steps already being taken to help
maintain a supply-demand balance in world oil markets. It
included the estimated 300,000 barrels a day of withdrawals
from commercial inventories in August and the expected higher
rate for September.
   More important, according to agency officials, was last
week's action by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries that approved increased production by those OPEC
members with spare capacity. "This will do much to replace
supplies removed from the market because of the embargo," the
agency said.
   OPEC's suspension of quotas officially endorses the output
increases that had been launched by Saudi Arabia and several
other countries in the wake of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
by Iraq. Already, production by Saudi Arabia is said to be
more than two million barrels a day higher than its former
OPEC quota of 5.4 million. The kingdom's output is believed
to be near 7.5 million barrels a day and could, according to
some Saudi sources, reach as high as 8.5 million barrels a
day, for brief periods, in a month or so if the market
requires it.
   Additionally, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates are
well on their way to adding a promised 500,000 barrels a day
each to their output. And several other OPEC countries with
some spare capacity are stepping up production as quickly as
possible.
   Nigeria's oil minister, Jibril Aminu, said yesterday that
oil companies in that nation are being directed to increase
production in line with the OPEC decision, according to the
OPEC News Agency. At last week's Vienna OPEC meeting, he said
Nigeria's production could be increased by 250,000 barrels a
day.
   The news agency said Mr. Aminu also urged meetings between
OPEC and the IEA to develop common measures to stabilize oil
markets. This followed similar calls last week by several
others in OPEC, including Iran's oil minister, who introduced
the idea.
   The other OPEC ministers didn't take any action on the
Iranian proposal. But in a statement issued after their
meeting they did call for active participation by
oil-consuming nations. They recommended that the IEA execute
its oil-sharing agreement, which they said "was specifically
designed to meet eventualities such as the present
situation." Also, they urged that the "present huge
accumulation" of oil-company inventories be used.
   Yesterday, Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister,
explained why OPEC considers cooperation by the consuming
nations, in drawing down their inventories, to be vitally
necessary for stable oil markets at this time. Much of the
additional crude to be produced by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and others is heavier -- or more dense -- than the oil it is
replacing, he said. Some refiners will have difficulty
processing it. Also, these crudes yield much less of the more
desired fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Many of the
consuming nations' stockpiles, mainly those held by oil
companies, include lighter crudes. "So that's why the
consumers were asked to help," he said.
   While IEA officials ruled out use of the emergency program
at this time, Helga Steeg, the agency's executive director,
said she had sent a message to OPEC Secretary-General Subroto
expressing appreciation for the decision to increase output.
She reiterated the IEA's opposition to any formal contact
between it and OPEC, although other officials said informal
contacts continue.
   The IEA officials said they will continue to monitor
oil-market developments closely to determine if additional
measures are necessary and that the governing board plans to
meet again Sept. 28. Meanwhile, the IEA reported in its
statement, "the immediate supply-demand situation is
manageable, given high stock levels and expected increases in
production."
