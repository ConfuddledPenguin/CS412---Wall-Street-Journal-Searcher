   Officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said
they are "concerned" about Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp.'s
decision to invest much of its assets in New Zealand while it
potentially faces tens of millions of dollars in liabilities
for an environmental cleanup.
   Separately, New Zealand regulators have begun an
investigation of alleged insider-trading violations by Gulf
Resources officials in connection with the company's
investments there, according to the EPA. Lawrence Mehl, Gulf
Resources' general counsel, confirmed that New Zealand
authorities had "looked into" possible violations by the
company earlier this year. "I am unaware of" current
investigations by New Zealand regulators, he added. New
Zealand authorities couldn't be reached for comment.

   The EPA's worries about Gulf Resources, based in Boston,
stem from the company's acquisition earlier this year of a
62% stake in City Realties Ltd., New Zealand, in a
transaction valued at about $150 million. "To the extent
{Gulf Resources} no longer has assets in the U.S., it may be
difficult for the government to collect" payments from it for
cleanup of the now-defunct Bunker Hill smelter in northern
Idaho, said Allan Bakalian, an assistant regional counsel
with the EPA in Seattle.
   The 21-square-mile Bunker Hill site, contaminated with
lead, zinc and other metals, is one of the nation's largest
cleanup projects under the federal government's Superfund
program. Gulf Resources, which operated the smelter from 1968
to 1982, is negotiating with the government over its share of
the cleanup costs, which could be more than $100 million, the
EPA said. Gulf Resources also owes pension benefits
associated with the smelter that have been estimated to total
as much as $100 million.
   As reported, in an agreement last year with the EPA, Gulf
Resources amended a reorganization plan that would have made
it a unit of a Bermuda concern, potentially exempting it from
liability for the smelter cleanup. Among other things, Gulf
Resources agreed to give the U.S. government advance written
notice before issuing any dividends or common stock or making
any loans exceeding $50 million to the Bermuda holding
company that was to have acquired it.
   But while bargaining with government lawyers last October
about its planned transfer of assets to Bermuda, Gulf
Resources was quietly negotiating New Zealand transactions
that invested much of its assets overseas, said the EPA's Mr.
Bakalian. "They never told us they were doing that" until the
New Zealand transaction was closed in January, he added.
"We're concerned they weren't totally forthright."
   Currently, it isn't clear what actions the government may
take, if any, concerning Gulf Resources' overseas
investments. But if the company refuses to pay its cleanup
liabilities, "there are options the EPA has to collect" them
even if the concern's assets are invested outside the U.S.,
Mr. Bakalian said.
   In Boston, Gulf Resources' Mr. Mehl said, "I'm not sure I
understand the EPA's concern. At the time we signed contracts
to buy New Zealand properties last January, we made a very
full public announcement."
   In another development, San Francisco businessman Donald
S. Kennedy confirmed that his D.S. Kennedy &amp; Co. recently
raised its stake in Gulf Resources to 24.4% from about 22%.
The concern earlier said it may seek control of Gulf
Resources, which is now controlled by British corporate
raider and real estate investor David J. Rowland.
