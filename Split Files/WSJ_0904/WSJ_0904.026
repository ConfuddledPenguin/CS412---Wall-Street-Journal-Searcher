   TOKYO -- Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan climbed
12% in August from a year earlier to 356,312 units, a record
for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association
said.
   Car sales rose 10% to 252,033 units. Sales of medium-size
cars soared 46% to 25,207 units, maintaining a sharp upward
trend that officials said has resulted in part from a growing
preference among the Japanese for upscale models. Small-car
sales showed a 7.1% gain from the previous year, totaling
226,826 units.

   Truck sales rose 15% to 102,532 units, the highest on
record for the month. Bus sales grew 18% from the previous
year to 1,747 units.
   Most car makers registered considerable growth in August
sales. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest car maker, sold
141,872 cars, trucks and buses, up 20% from a year earlier.
Sales by Nissan Motor Co., the second biggest manufacturer,
rose 5.1% to 82,245 units. Mazda Motor Corp. reported sales
of 31,019 units, an 11% gain. Sales by Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. jumped 19% to 26,983 units.
   On the other hand, Honda Motor Co. posted a 3.8% drop,
with sales totaling 27,699 units. Honda officials said the
decline was a result of brisk sales the previous year on the
introduction of a popular new model.
   Separately, Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses rose
2.9% in July from a year earlier to 489,804 units because of
growing car shipments, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association reported.
