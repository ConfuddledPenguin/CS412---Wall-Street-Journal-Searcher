   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Hedged-Investments Associates Inc. and
its founder, James D. Donahue, filed for protection from
creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code late Thursday.
   Hedged-Investments is managing general partner of Hedged
Securities Associates Inc., a limited partnership. On Aug.
23, Mr. Donahue told 500 Hedged Securities investors, via
videotape, that he had lost more than $100 million of their
money through stock-option trading, primarily involving
shares of UAL Corp. Attorneys for the firm say Hedged
Securities has only about $2 million in assets remaining.

   Hedged-Investments filed under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, which gives businesses protection from
creditors while they formulate a reorganization plan. Mr.
Donahue filed under Chapter 13, which grants similar
protection to individuals. Aeroturbine Energy Corp., another
Hedged Investments subsidiary, also filed for Chapter 11
protection.
   The Hedged-Investment filing listed more than 1,000
creditors but provided few details about the company's assets
and liabilities. Lawyers for the firm said such information
would be provided in future filings.
   In a federal lawsuit filed last week, Weyerhaeuser Co.
said its pension fund lost an estimated $35 million by
investing in Hedged Securities. In separate suits filed in
state district court here, Paradigm Partners Inc., Chicago
said a pension fund it controls lost more than $15 million
through similar investments. Union Texas Petroleum Holdings
Inc., Houston, said its pension fund lost about $8 million.
