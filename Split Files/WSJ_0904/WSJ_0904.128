   NEW YORK -- Money managers often caution investors against
reaching too far for high yields, but lately that has been
the only way to get ahead in the international bond market.
   So far this year, international bonds that pay high yields
are producing double-digit returns for investors even though
bond prices have fallen sharply.

   When Iraq's early August invasion of Kuwait resulted in
soaring oil prices, global bond prices tumbled, and
international investors braced for what they assumed would be
a period of negative total returns. While returns for the
month of August were fairly lousy, the year-to-date figures
are pretty good and analysts say the returns should improve
dramatically in the weeks and months ahead as the dollar
resumes its downward move in foreign-exchange markets.
   The Mideast turmoil "produced one of the biggest sell-offs
in the global financial markets on record," said Nicholas
Sargen, director of international research at Salomon
Brothers Inc., in the firm's weekly bond market comments.
"Yields in all the principal international markets soared
during August, with those in Japan, West Germany and the U.S.
testing or setting 1990 highs."
   When the dust settled, "things weren't all that bad," said
Victor Filatov, an analyst at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
   Measured by the J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. global bond index, which
tracks the performance of 454 government bonds issued by 11
countries, non-U.S. bonds posted a negative total return of
0.37% for August and a positive 4.90% return so far this year
-- in dollars. The Salomon Brothers World Government bond
index posted a total dollar return of 0.19% for the month and
4.87% for the year.
   The best-performing bonds for U.S. investors were those
issued by countries that offer high yields, such as Spain,
Britain and Australia. The worst performers, with the only
negative return for the year to date, were bonds issued by
Japan, down 6.28%.
   Thomas Prapas, a portfolio manager at Clemente Capital
Corp., said that many investors moved into global bonds in
early spring, attracted by the relatively high yields. Bond
yields are about 12% in Britain, 13% in Australia and 15% in
New Zealand and Spain, compared with between 8% and 9% in the
U.S.
   Mr. Prapas manages a $200 million global bond mutual fund
for Freedom Capital Management Corp.
   There are three components of the total return on
fixed-income securities denominated in foreign currencies:
income from interest payments, local bond-price changes and
currency changes.
   Consider the total return for a U.S. investor who may have
purchased an Australian government bond. Although the price
of the bond was flat, the total return for the bond was 3.47%
in the month of August and 11.72% so far this year.
   In early January, when one U.S. dollar bought 1.27
Australian dollars, a 10,000 Australian dollar bond was worth
about $7,874. By August, when one dollar was trading at 1.23
Australian dollars, the value of that same bond rose to about
$8,130, based purely on changes in the currency. The high 13%
yield boosted the total return even further.
   Although the dollar was sharply lower against most major
currencies during most of last month, it surged last Thursday
and Friday. However, analysts expect the dollar to start to
tumble again. If that happens, U.S. investors in
international bond funds should benefit.
   "The returns this year have been very good," said Adam
Greshin, a vice president at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark and
assistant portfolio manager of the Scudder International Bond
Fund. "After two dry years, we are finally seeing some
significant returns."
   That may explain the renewed popularity of international
bond funds for U.S. investors. Scudder said assets in its
international bond fund rose from about $31.5 million at the
start of the year to about $105 million last month. Many
other global bond funds also grew, but at a smaller pace.
   The J.P. Morgan index includes bonds of varying
maturities, with an average maturity of 6.6 years for
non-U.S. bonds and 7.5 years when U.S. bonds are included.
Portfolios with a longer average maturity than the Morgan
index would have experienced smaller returns. Portfolios with
shorter maturities would have posted higher total returns
than the Morgan index. That's because long-term foreign
government bonds, like those in the U.S., have taken far
greater hits than short-term securities.
   Mr. Filatov at J.P. Morgan estimates that total returns of
short-term securities exceeded the returns on long-term
securities by between two and 4.5 percentage points in the
month of August alone.

   Friday's Market Activity

   The bond market ended the week modestly lower in quiet
trading, with prices fluctuating with the price of oil.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended Friday's pre-holiday
shortened trading session at a price of 97 16/32, down 1/8
point on the day for a loss of about $1.25 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield ended unchanged from
Thursday at 8.98%. For the entire week, the long-term bond
rose nearly 1 3/4 points.
   Major dealers closed their trading desks at 2 p.m. EDT on
Friday and financial markets were closed yesterday in
observance of Labor Day.
   Short-term securities were also higher Friday, due mostly
to perceptions that the Federal Reserve is poised to ease
monetary policy.
   In the corporate market, junk bonds edged lower. Traders
said that prices, on average, were quoted about 1/4 point
lower but only a handful of issues traded.
   For the entire month of August, junk bond prices fell
sharply and resulted in a negative total return of 4.62%,
according to First Boston Corp.'s high-yield index. The index
tracks 349 issues representing nearly $100 billion of
securities. First Boston said the index posted a total return
of 1.4% so far this year.
   Sam DeRosa-Farag, a First Boston high-yield analyst, said
it was the top-tier, so-called "go-go" junk bonds that
experienced the largest price declines. "Even bonds issued by
companies considered recession resistant were hit hard," he
said.
   That's partly because go-go bonds are easier to sell than
some other junk bonds, so investors who want to get out of
the market in a hurry tend to sell these securities first.
But also, higher-quality junk bonds were slow to react to
talk of recession during the month of July.
   These bonds "did not reflect enough bad news before, but
now they reflect the bad news a little bit too much," said
Mr. DeRosa-Farag.
