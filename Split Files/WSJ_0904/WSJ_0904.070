   WASHINGTON -- Martin Marietta Corp. paid an additional
$2,565,377 to settle civil charges that its Martin Marietta
Electronics &amp; Missiles Group overcharged the government for
use of computer facilities, the Justice Department said.
   The company earlier had paid $898,000 to settle part of
the case, which began when the company voluntarily disclosed
the problem in September 1986. The Justice Department said an
investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
found that the Martin Marietta unit provided inflated cost
data and as a result received more money than it should have.

   The unit had disclosed that it overcharged the government
for use of its Technical Computation Center, and has
cooperated with the investigation, the Justice Department
said. Since disclosing the problem, Martin Marietta has taken
corrective actions, including dismissing employees who were
found responsible, improving reporting and billing
procedures, and increasing its training and internal audits,
a company spokesman said.
