   Not long ago, the stuffy pharmaceutical industry viewed
the idea of pitching prescription drugs directly to the
public as, well, unseemly.
   No more.

   In today's fierce marketing climate, a growing number of
drug makers are pushing their products in the consumer press
rather than limiting their advertising to medical journals.
They've placed ads in major newspapers as well as women's,
fishing and news magazines. Drug companies will spend an
estimated $90 million this year on such taboo-breaking
advertising, compared with the roughly $20 million spent in
1987.
   All the big pharmaceutical manufacturers "are playing
around with it," says Samuel D. Isaly, an industry consultant
in New York, "because everybody is fighting for market
share."
   Drug concerns also are taking a much more aggressive tack
in these ads, mentioning products by brand names for the
first time and sometimes offering moneyback gimmicks. Upjohn,
for example, is trying to lift lower-than-anticipated sales
of its baldness medicine Rogaine by giving men a $10
certificate for seeing their doctor. Other remedies now
hawked by name include Marion Merrell Dow's anti-allergy
medicine Seldane and anti-smoking gum Nicorette, Ciba-Geigy's
menopausal treatment Estraderm and Pfizer's anti-angina drug
Procardia.
   Within two years, prescription-drug ads targeted at
consumers "will become as commonplace as ones for
over-the-counter products," predicts Joy Scott, chief
executive of Scott-Levin Associates, a pharmaceutical
consulting firm in Newtown, Pa. "We are seeing and hearing
about more companies planning campaigns who have never done
it before," she says, including makers of anti-cholesterol
agents.
   Sandoz is seriously considering a consumer ad drive for
1991, even though its first effort ran afoul of the Food and
Drug Administration. In 1987, Sandoz introduced one of the
first brand-name ads, a promotion for its antihistamine
Tavist, aimed at doctors reading general-interest
publications. The company yanked the ad after the FDA
attacked some claims as "false and misleading."
   "Sandoz felt at that time and still does that {consumer
advertising} is a trend that is coming," says David Winter,
vice president of scientific and external affairs at Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals. To ensure the next campaign's success, Mr.
Winter adds, "we are doing more than the usual consultation
with the FDA."
   The government agency, while no longer openly hostile to
consumer advertising, still requires that ads giving a
prescription product's name and suggested usage contain a
list of possible ill effects. Because of the rules,
brand-name drug advertising on television is impractical. "No
network is going to sell you the 15 minutes of air time"
needed to broadcast the lengthy laundry list, notes Ken
Feather, acting FDA director of drug advertising.
   The FDA requirements make drug pitches in consumer
publications much more expensive than conventional ones in
the medical press. A consumer campaign last year by Lexis
Pharmaceuticals cost the tiny maker of birth-control pills $6
million. That was partly because its ad, in magazines such as
Cosmopolitan and Glamour, ran two full pages, with the
warnings consuming a whole page of fine print. Although Lexis
officials claim the effort significantly boosted pill sales,
they halted the ads so they could find extra private
financing.
   "You have to have enough money to just keep at it," says
Richard Donovan, executive vice president of Lexis's agency,
Mathieu, Goluskin, Donovan &amp; Clarke in New York. Advertising
drugs to the public "is a long-term investment. It's not
something that will take place in a few years."
   The high price leaves some industry executives dubious
about whether the new advertising approach is more effective
than pitching solely to health professionals. Pzifer began
running its ads for an improved version of Procardia in
leading news magazines and newspapers last November. Still,
"we are not real keen on this direct-to-consumer
advertising," says Rick Honey, a company spokesman. "We have
no direct evidence that {the campaigns} have any positive
effect on sales."
   Ms. Scott thinks the ranks of doubters will shrink amid
growing market research showing that consumer advertising
works. More patients now cite ad copy when they discuss
possible treatments with their family physicians, according
to a recent survey of doctors by her firm.
   And doctors are increasingly willing to prescribe drugs
that their patients specifically request. Compared with the
medical profession's strident opposition a few years ago, she
says, "that's a major change in physician attitude toward
direct-to-consumer advertising."
