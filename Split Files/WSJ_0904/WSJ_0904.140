   In regard to "The Stakes in the Gulf" (editorial, Aug.
15), I think the stupidity of President Bush's decision to
send troops to the Mideast is beyond description. Your
editorial conveniently fails to mention that the main reason
our troops have been sent is that Congress has persistently
and repeatedly refused to allow the Arab countries to arm
themselves adequately.
