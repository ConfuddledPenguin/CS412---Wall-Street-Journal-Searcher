   NEW YORK -- Today, about 300 key employees of Sotheby's
Holdings Inc. become eligible, for the first time, to
exercise stock options allowing them to buy up to 2.5 million
shares at a huge discount and resell them at the market
price.
   How nice that the stock of the art-auction giant rose 6%
Friday after Sotheby's announced it will buy back up to three
million of its own shares.

   Under the terms of a compensation program set up in
September 1987, veteran and prized Sotheby's employees were
granted options to purchase a total 7.5 million shares
(adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in July 1989). The first
third of those options become exercisable today at $1.50 a
share. In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Sotheby's
shares closed at $12.625, up 75 cents.
   Diana Phillips Levitt, spokeswoman for the company, said
the buy-back announcement wasn't intended to lift the price
of the stock for the benefit of the options-holders. Most of
the stock options, she said, are being granted to 18 top
Sotheby's officials who, under Securities and Exchange
Commission insider-trading rules, are prohibited from selling
them for six months.
   But the remaining Sotheby's employees granted options can
immediately buy and resell the shares at the market price,
which based on Friday's close would amount to a turnaround
profit of 741.7%. Those 282 employees "will be perfectly free
to trade," said Harvey Pitt, a former general counsel of the
SEC and now a securities attorney with the law firm Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson. "You can buy company stock
in the morning and sell it in the afternoon."
   Ms. Levitt said the options exercises figured in the
announcement of the buy-back -- which the company decided on
Thursday to launch -- only in that "given the knowledge that
a portion of the employee stock ownership program vested on
Tuesday, it was important for all shareholders to have the
information about the buy-back simultaneously and prior to
the vesting of the options." The company's top insiders, she
said, would only be disadvantaged by a near-term run-up in
the stock price because they'd pay higher taxes on their
shares. The options program was set up to encourage key
employees to remain with the company for some time after it
went public in May 1988.
   SEC officials declined to comment on the stock buy-back
other than to say that no rules cover the timing of buy-back
announcements such as this one. Companies normally buy back
their own shares to boost their stock prices, or sometimes to
fend off a takeover bid. Sotheby's stock is near the low end
of its 52-week trading range of $10.125 to $37 a share. The
stock has fallen sharply on poor results last spring for some
of the firm's auctions here and in London of contemporary
art, Soviet art and impressionist paintings.
   Ms. Levitt said the buy-back wasn't in response to any
takeover overtures, adding that A. Alfred Taubman, chairman
of the company, controls more than 60% of the voting power.
Sotheby's has two classes of stock with different voting
rights. The options-holders will receive Class B shares,
which carry ten votes per share. The Class B shares convert
upon sale to Class A shares, which carry one vote.
   The New York auction house had 18.5 million common shares
outstanding Aug. 27. The stock buy-back, which is being
funded with cash on hand, represents 16.2% of the outstanding
shares. Given the stock's close Thursday, the buy-back will
cost the company about $36 million. It's an "open-ended
program, which will take place over a period of time," and
the shares purchased will be retired, said Ms. Levitt. "It's
an excellent investment for the company and a very good use
of our corporate funds."
   Separately, ADT Ltd., a British conglomerate, said it
increased its stake in another leading auction house,
London-based Christie's International PLC. Since July, the
company has boosted its stake to 22% from 20%, and now holds
38,115,000 voting shares. Throughout the acquisition, ADT
officials have maintained that they have no plans to attempt
a takeover.
