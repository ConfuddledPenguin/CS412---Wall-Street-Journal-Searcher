   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- First Fidelity Bancorp., in a move
that other large banks may follow, said it contracted with
Electronic Data Systems to consolidate the company's software
systems and data center operations.
   The 10-year contract -- valued at about $450 million -- is
believed to be the largest so-called outsourcing agreement by
a U.S. commercial bank.

   For First Fidelity, one of the largest banks in the U.S.
with $29.8 billion in assets and 500 offices in New Jersey
and eastern Pennsylvania, the arrangement is aimed at
consolidating the software systems faster than the bank could
have done on its own. As a result, the bank will benefit
sooner from the consolidation, which First Fidelity expects
could trim $50 million a year from expenses.
   "We have an ambitious timetable in which to achieve total
integration and consolidation of all the company's product
and service lines," said Anthony P. Terracciano, the bank's
chairman and chief executive officer in a statement.
   Like many large banks, First Fidelity has grown in the
past decade through various mergers. Each acquisition added a
new set of slightly different services and back office
operations to the firm. Integrating the various operations
has proven to be quite tricky for many banks.
   Under the agreement with Dallas-based EDS, First Fidelity
wants to consolidate about 250 of the bank's software systems
into about 60 systems over 18 months. EDS, a unit of General
Motors Corp., is also charged with merging the bank's data
centers in New Brunswick, N.J., and Philadelphia into a
single location within six months. After that, EDS will
manage the operations and keep the bank's data center staff
of 300 on its payroll.
   Still, cost-cutting looms high on First Fidelity's list of
objectives. Officials point out that the EDS agreement will
not mean any additional costs to the company because the $450
million contract will displace the bank's internal costs of
running consolidated data operations on its own over the 10
years. The bank is currently in the throes of a program
designed to reduce operating expenses by $115 million
annually. The savings from consolidating software systems
would be on top of that.
   After studying numerous proposals, bank officials said
they awarded the contract to EDS because of the firm's
experience in merging systems quickly with minimal risk of
disruption to customers. EDS, an information technology
company, had revenue of $5.5 billion in 1989.
   Analysts said First Fidelity's decision to go to outside
sources to handle data operations management could have
important strategic considerations for the banking industry.
"Broadly, we see this as a powerful trend that will be
beneficial to banks and a small number of vendors such as
EDS," said Ladd Willis, managing vice president at First
Manhattan Consulting Group, a New York firm specializing in
management consulting to financial institutions. "It's
possible that First Fidelity could emerge as one of the most
profitable banks in the country."
   The issue of whether banks should use outside sources to
handle systems integrations and manage data processing
centers is a hot topic in the banking industry these days.
Many small banks, and some large financial institutions such
as Hibernia National Bank, New Orleans, and Meritor Financial
Group, Philadelphia, have pushed ahead with outsourcing
agreements. But large super-regional banks have been
reluctant to do so, fearing a loss of control of their
technology.
   First Fidelity officials say that won't be a problem with
EDS because the deal is designed to give the bank control
over software development and management, while leaving
hardware in the hands of EDS.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, First Fidelity
closed at $13.875, up 37.5 cents.
