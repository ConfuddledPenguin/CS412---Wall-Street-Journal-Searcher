   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. said an explosion killed two workers
at one of the three electric furnaces at the PT International
Nickel Indonesia nickel smelter.
   The nickel producer, which owns about 58% of the
Indonesian company, said it didn't yet know the extent of
damage from the explosion, which it said was apparently
caused by a water leak.

   Inco said production has been halted at the smelter since
Aug. 25 for five weeks of repairs and other work related to
an expansion program.
