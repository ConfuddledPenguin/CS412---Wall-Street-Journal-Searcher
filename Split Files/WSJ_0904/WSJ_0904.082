   RADIOACTIVITY IN POLYNESIA

   Radioactivity from French underground nuclear tests at
Mururoa atoll is leaking into the Pacific Ocean only a few
years after each test, according to a new study by a U.S.
scientist.
   The findings by scientist Norm Buske of the
Washington-based environmental pressure group Search
Technical Services challenge French-government claims that
such contamination would take hundreds of years to surface at
the Polynesian bomb site. The study is based on
re-examination of water samples taken by French marine
biologist Jacques Cousteau from Mururoa lagoon on June 22,
1987, the day after a nuclear test.
   "Water in Mururoa lagoon is contaminated with cesium-134
and cesium-137 leaking from underground nuclear tests," Mr.
Buske's study said. "The time required for radioactive
leakage to reach the open environment from nuclear explosions
under Mururoa is probably less than six years."
   Mr. Buske called for a study of the test sites at Mururoa
and neighboring Fangataufa atoll to determine the extent of
radioactive contamination.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY'S NEW VISA REQUIREMENTS
                                                                                                       

   Italy began requiring visas for Turks and citizens of
several North African countries yesterday under a law
intended to limit immigration. Algerians, Moroccans,
Mauritanians, Tunisians and Turks will all have to have
visas, the Foreign Ministry said. In April, Italy imposed
visa requirements on citizens of Senegal and Gambia. Italy
gets an estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants a year.
                                                                                                       

   A NEWCOMER IN SCOTLAND
                                                                                                       

   Mizuno Corp., a leading Japanese sporting-goods maker,
said it would build a golf-club-assembly factory near
Glasgow, Scotland. The new plant will start up in December,
with production capacity of 240,000 clubs in the first year.
Mizuno now sells golf clubs in Europe made in Taiwan and
South Korea.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET MEDICINE SHORTAGE
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union is running out of essential medicines,
angering consumers already beset by shortages of gasoline,
tobacco and food. "As early as next February, the country may
run out of drugs completely, because the pharmaceutical
industry is crumbling even more rapidly than the rest of the
economy," Health Minister Igor Denisov warned. Said the
workers' newspaper Trud: "We have already seen tobacco riots.
Shall we now prepare for aspirin riots?"
                                                                                                       

   BRAZILIAN INFLATION
                                                                                                       

   Inflation in Brazil was 10.58% in August but showed signs
of slackening, the government said. The inflation rate was
slightly lower than the 10.97% increase in July, the
government statistics bureau IBGE said. However, the final
figure disappointed economic policy makers who had predicted
inflation of 8.5% in August. The increase was blamed in part
on higher fuel prices. Brazil imports about 45% of its oil.
Brazil's consumer prices in the past 12 months have risen
4,272%.
                                                                                                       

   GOING AFTER MARCOS MONEY
                                                                                                       

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino swore in a new
chairman of the government committee attempting to recover
the "hidden wealth" of the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
The appointee, David Castro, is the fifth person to head the
Presidential Commission on Good Government in the four years
since it was created. After the oath-taking, Mr. Castro said
he was confident his commission would recover by 1991 a
"substantial portion" of the money and property that Mr.
Marcos and his associates allegedly took from the Philippine
treasury.
                                                                                                       

   WORLD CLIMATE CONFERENCE
                                                                                                       

   Representatives from 75 countries reached agreement last
week on the mechanics of global warming but differed over how
to combat it.
   The four-day United Nations meeting in Sundsvall, Sweden,
backed a report acknowledging basic scientific facts about
the so-called greenhouse effect, said conference chairman
Bert Bolin. "But it has been harder to agree on concrete
measures," he said, adding: "Political considerations enter
the picture."
   The conference report was not immediately published, but
officials said there were few fundamental changes to the
draft presented by members of the U.N. Environment Program
and the World Meteorological Organization. The draft report
agreed that burning fossil fuels releases "greenhouse gases,"
particularly carbon dioxide, that trap heat near Earth's
surface and raise temperatures.
   Mr. Bolin said a problem facing negotiators was that
developing countries, with about 75% of the world's
population, emit only 25% of global greenhouse gases. As
these nations develop, he said, their emissions will rise
steeply unless industrialized nations provide financial aid
for environment-friendly technology.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Delays in Soviet payments for imports from Japan are
reportedly worsening after a period of improvement. A
Japanese news agency said the delays totaled $518 million as
of the end of July, up 16.1% from the month before. . . .
Dutch horticulturalists plan to sell flowers grown without
pesticides. The Westland flower auction in Naaldwijk would
initially set aside an area for selling chemical-free
chrysanthemums, but this may be extended to other flowers and
potted plants, an industry official said.
