   TOKYO -- As Japan's beleaguered stock market rapidly loses
its luster of invincibility, regulators are toughening their
stance on stock-price manipulation.
   Officials sent a clear signal that they intend to crack
down on improper trading when the Finance Ministry and Tokyo
Stock Exchange moved Friday to punish four securities firms
-- including a Citicorp subsidiary -- that allegedly
participated in a stock-rigging scheme earlier this year.

   The ministry said that it will temporarily suspend the
licenses of four securities houses -- Daiwa Securities Co.,
National Securities Co., Ace Securities Co. and London-based
Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers Co. -- as punishment for their
role in assisting a prominent corporate raider's attempt to
artificially inflate the stock of one of Japan's largest
hotel and restaurant chains. In separate statements, the
firms acknowledged their roles.
   Each of the three Japanese houses will be required to
close a retail branch office for two days, but the suspension
won't hurt them much because each has numerous other offices
through which they can do business. Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers's Tokyo branch office was closed for one day,
yesterday.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange, following a rule in its articles
of association that require it to impose concurrent
penalties, said it would suspend those same offices' trading
privileges on the exchange for those days. In addition, the
exchange summoned representatives of the four firms and
imposed fines of 500,000 yen ($3,500) on each company -- the
maximum financial penalty the exchange can exact.
   "It's just symbolic," said Robert Zielinski, a financial
analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Co. "But the
authorities are making a good show of it."
   He noted that regulators this year have cracked down on
securities companies for a number of improper activities.
Daiwa and several other securities companies were fined by
tax authorities for improperly paying compensation to large
clients who lost money during the Black Monday market decline
in 1987, and Daiwa also was accused of protecting some large
fund-management clients. The government and the stock
exchange also have increased the number of possible
insider-trading cases under investigation, just a year after
passing a stringent insider-trading law.
   "The Finance Ministry is taking a much tougher stance
compared to just a couple of years ago," said Masatoshi
Yasuda, general manager of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers. "We
have to retrain our sales persons because the market
environment is changing."
   The tighter regulatory environment has accompanied a steep
decline in share prices on the once-highflying Tokyo
exchange. Since closing 1989 at a record 38915.87, the Nikkei
average of 225 stocks has plunged more than 35%, closing
Monday at 25420.43, down 557.94 points.
   Friday's actions were the first authorities have taken
against Japanese securities firms since 1980, when Okasan
Securities Co. was punished for a similar violation. The
measures against Citicorp are the first taken against a
foreign firm for stock manipulation. Citicorp and other
foreign firms weren't even allowed to join the Tokyo Stock
Exchange until 1986.
   "We take this very seriously," Citicorp's Mr. Yasuda said.
Although the financial costs of shutting for a day are
"negligible," he said, the punitive action "is very
embarrassing."
   The three Japanese securities companies issued statements
apologizing for any improper activities. "We are giving these
measures grave consideration," a Daiwa spokesman said. "In
the future, we will implement policies to ensure that this
sort of thing does not happen again. We want to do our utmost
to regain the trust of our investors."
   Kodo Shimizu, a spokesman for Ace Securities said, "Our
entire firm is working to restore trust and prevent the
recurrence of securities incidents." National is "deeply
sorry for this regrettable incident which has troubled
society," a statement said. "The entire board of directors
recognizes its social responsibility and intends to work to
prevent similar incidents from happening again."
   The alleged stock-manipulation scheme took place last
April, when investor Mitsuhiro Kotani, a close friend of
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, attempted to boost
the price of Fujita Tourist Enterprises Co. in order to repay
debts he owed to Kokusai Kogyo, an investment firm in which
he served as a director. Mr. Kotani had used his position as
a leading stock holder in Kokusai Kogyo Co. to borrow an
estimated 19 billion yen from the firm and its subsidiaries.
   Strapped for cash when the loans came due, Mr. Kotani
allegedly hatched a bold -- and illegal -- plan to bail
himself out, police said. The gambit involved boosting the
value of the hotel chain's stock, of which Mr. Kotani's
company, Koshin Co., owned four million shares. During a five
day period in April, Mr. Kotani and an associate, Shuichi
Yamamoto, used false names to trade Fujita shares between
each other using the four securities companies as
intermediaries.
   The manuever succeeded at first. The value of Fujita stock
soared from 3,900 yen to 5,200 yen a share and after
allegedly selling his inflated shares Mr. Kotani was able to
pay off more than half of his debt.
   The scheme backfired because authorities at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange became alarmed at the sudden increase in
volume of Fujita stock being traded and mounted an
investigation, authorities said. Three months later, the
Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office arrested Mr. Kotani and
Mr. Yamamoto for stock manipulation.
   Ministry officials say the four securities firms violated
Article 50 of Japan's Securities and Exchange Law, which
prohibits brokers from knowingly trading stocks that they
have reason to believe have been artificially inflated.
   The ministry's punishment of the four firms carries no
criminal penalty, and the Ministry of Justice has decided not
to prosecute the four securities companies, a Finance
Ministry official said.
