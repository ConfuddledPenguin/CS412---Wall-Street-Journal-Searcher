   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co., citing soft demand,
said it will halt production for a week at its Kansas City,
Mo., car plant and its medium and heavy-duty truck assembly
facility in Louisville, Ky.
   A total of 4,200 workers will be laid off at the two
plants during the week of Sept. 10, the auto maker said.

   The Kansas City plant is building 1991 versions of the
Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz compact models. Dealers have a
relatively lean 54 to 55 days of inventories of these cars.
But Ford said dealers aren't ordering enough 1991 models to
sustain the planned production, an indication that dealers
are skittish about a possible sales slump this fall. The
plant has about 2,300 hourly employees who build about 4,000
cars a week.
   The truck plant, with about 1,900 hourly workers, produces
about 1,100 vehicles a week, Ford said.
