   NEW YORK -- Last month, when fear of war breaking out in
the Middle East gripped the country, investors were behaving
remarkably rationally in the stock market.
   At least, that's how it looks upon examination of the New
York Stock Exchange shares that did best and worst last
month.

   Among the ten stocks that rallied the most, even as the
Big Board's Composite Index -- the broadest measure of the
exchange's common stocks -- fell 9.06%, are shares of
companies showing an earnings turnaround, strengthening their
balance sheets, or that are in the energy business. Takeover
stocks were the two biggest gainers.
   Among the biggest losers, a common characteristic was
disappointing earnings -- in a market already looking ahead
to weaker corporate profits.
   Unlike the prestige group of high-growth issues that
dominated investors' attention for the first half of the
year, many of the winning stocks trade thinly and are shares
of companies reporting better earnings for the first time in
a long while. Indeed, some of these stock prices are low
because of a history of bad earnings; small price advances
produce big percentage gains.
   Even so, the stories behind the stocks of August provide
investors an early look at what concepts of value are likely
to move stocks higher in the weeks ahead.
   "This is an event-driven market," says Michael Painchaud,
principal at Market Profile Theorems, a Seattle firm that
studies stock market trends. The event is the threat to a
large portion of the world's oil supply; the most visible
repercussion in the stock market has been a sharp
appreciation in energy issues.
   Global Marine, a highly leveraged, international offshore
driller and producer, could benefit from an escalation in rig
fees. The company was in bankruptcy proceedings until March
1989, and debt is currently about 400% of equity. But David
Herasimchuk, head of investor relations, says the company
negotiated beneficial terms on the remaining debt, which will
give it the flexibility to grow with an oil boom. With U.S.
energy policy likely to encourage domestic exploration and
production, Global Marine, with 27 drilling rigs, is in
position to benefit.
   Some investors sought haven last month in stocks of
companies that are snapping a streak of bad earnings. "The
market's reaction to the Mideast has been so severe because
of the fear that it would make a weak profit situation
worse," says Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon
Read. "Any company bucking that trend would be a buy
candidate."
   Aside from the energy stocks, companies reporting or
expecting better earnings among the top ten are Bolt Beranek
&amp; Newman, Aileen, Talley Industries, Carriage Industries, and
GRC International.
   Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., technology
company, earned 21 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter
ended June 30, compared with a loss of $1.27 a share in the
same period a year earlier. Also, the company plans to buy
back $15 million of its long-term debt, and about 700,000
shares of stock, to strengthen its balance sheet. Analysts
are wary of recommending the stock yet because of prior
losses. But Steven B. Frankel, vice president at Adams,
Harkness &amp; Hill, says he is convinced the company has "a
storehouse of valuable technology."
   Earnings at Talley Industries are expected to get a boost
eventually from royalties on automobile air bags. The company
sold its air bag business to TRW Inc. more than a year ago,
but secured a 12-year royalty agreement that could be worth
$190 million, the company says.
   Carriage Industries, a carpet maker, earned 44 cents a
share in the fourth quarter ended July 1, compared with 1
cent a share in the year-earlier period. The company,
followed by few analysts on Wall Street, is expecting further
earnings improvement in 1991, and gains in market share.
   Marion Merrell Dow is expected to have stable to higher
earnings in coming quarters. But a huge buyer in the market
-- Dow Chemical -- is largely responsible for lifting the
stock 19% last month. Michael Smith, director of research at
B.C. Christopher, says investors perceive a floor under the
stock because of Dow Chemical's option to purchase up to 80%
of the shares outstanding by July 1992. Dow Chemical
announced Friday that it owns a 68% stake.
   GRC International earned 10 cents a share in the fourth
quarter ended June 30 compared with a 20 cent loss the
previous year. The company is also redeeming some bonds with
high interest rates.
   Another example of investors favoring stronger balance
sheets is Health Equity Properties. The real estate
investment trust trimmed its short-term debt burden in
August, replacing it with bonds convertible into stock.
   Real buy-outs and stocks that appear to be takeover
candidates shot up in August.
   Fund American Cos. recently agreed to sell its insurance
operations to West German insurer Allianz for $3.3 billion.
The remaining company has a large investment in oil stocks.
   Equimark's share price was rising even before the Tisch
family on Friday disclosed a 6.8% stake in the company. One
analyst, who declined to be identified, said investors have
been buying the stock on the possibility of a takeover.
"Investors are looking at the break-up value," he said. They
think Equimark Chairman Alan Fellheimer "will salvage his
investment" by selling parts or all of the company, the
analyst said.
   The earnings disappointments of the top losers echoed
several familiar woes: slumping consumer spending, fallout
from a lousy junk-bond market, debt problems, tightening
credit and rising oil prices.
   AmBase, a New York insurance and financial services
concern, was the top percentage loser. It had a large
second-quarter loss, compared to a year-earlier profit. The
company cited losses from junk-bond holdings in its Home
Insurance Co. unit and lackluster results in its investment
services operations, including Gruntal &amp; Co., a brokerage.
Adding to its woes were doubts about a plan to sell the
insurance unit.
   Businessland, the San Jose, Calif., computer retailer,
posted a large loss for its fourth-quarter ended June 30. The
loss put the company in violation of covenants on senior
notes and surprised analysts, who were further distressed by
news that the company would have to restate results for the
fiscal second and third quarters because of accounting
errors.
   Huntway Partners, the third-largest loser, can place at
least some of the blame for its performance squarely on
Saddam Hussein. The Valencia, Calif., liquid-asphalt company
said that while first-half results were strong, rising oil
prices would hurt earnings in the future -- especially since
asphalt prices have been falling.
   Finevest Foods, a Greenwich, Conn., frozen-food and
dairy-products company, posted second-quarter earnings of
$764,000, or seven cents a share, up from $179,000, or two
cents a share, a year earlier. But some analysts were
expecting 10 cents a share, the company says. With just 10.6
million shares outstanding, and 51% of them in the chairman's
hands, it isn't hard to move the stock.
   For Fairfield Communities, the problem is skittishness
about the real estate business. Its lender, Bank of Boston,
cut the resort developer's credit facility and put the
company on a 47-month installment plan to pay the debt
outstanding. The company said the move would hurt its ability
to do business.
   Tacoma Boatbuilding, Tacoma, Wash., might have been
expected to do better last month, with roughly half its
business coming from U.S. and foreign government military
contracts. But the company posted a second-quarter loss,
compared with a year-earlier profit. Expansion costs are
hurting profitability, the company said.
   As an industrial sewing-machine maker, Reece Corp., based
in Waltham, Mass., posted a loss and cut its dividend, citing
a slowdown in capital spending among struggling apparel
makers.
   "What's worse for us is the credit crunch," says Don Blom,
vice president, finance. "That has had a pronounced effect on
our smaller customers that tend to finance their equipment
needs."
   Great American Bank, based in San Diego, posted a sharply
wider loss due to loan and real-estate losses near the end of
July, knocking it out of compliance with regulatory
requirements. There isn't any guarantee that a pending sale
of some its branches would meet regulatory and shareholder
approval, the bank said.
   Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Newton, Mass., was another
company where shares got hammered for reporting
lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The long-term
health-care provider announced a $10 million buy-back of
stock, but the stock didn't respond.
   Investors sold shares of TCBY Enterprises, a Little Rock,
Ark., chain of yogurt stores, on the news that third-quarter
earnings would be hurt by increased competition and a slowing
economy.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stocks closed higher in the slowest session of the year,
with institutional and futures-related buying lifting prices.
   With the Persian Gulf situation remaining unsettled and
U.S. markets closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday, few
investors took part. New York Stock Exchange volume failed to
surpass 100 million shares for the first time since the
session after last Christmas. Just 96,480,000 shares changed
hands on the Big Board; the previous low for the year was
111.7 million on July 6.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 21.04 to 2614.36
-- bringing its rise for the week to 81.46 points, or 3.2%.
The weekly advance snapped the industrial average's six-week
losing streak.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.85 to 322.56; the
New York Stock Exchange Composite index gained 1.74 to 176.97
and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 3.23 to 298.81.
All three indexes each posted a gain of about 3.5% for the
week.
   Oil stocks and consumer issues viewed as
recession-resistant performed strongly.
   Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 50; Chevron added 5/8 to 75 7/8; Mobil
rose 7/8 to 63 7/8, and Amoco climbed 1 to 55. In the
consumer sector,
   Coca-Cola Co. rose 1 to 42 1/4; Merck rose 1 5/8 to 81 5/8
and Procter &amp; Gamble added 3/4 to 77.
   Bank of New England climbed 1 1/8 to 2 1/8 in trading of
2.6 million shares after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
denied speculation that federal regulators were about to
seize the bank holding company's main unit. On Thursday, the
stock fell 1/2 as the rumors swept through the market.
   Continental Bank gained 3/4 to 10 7/8 and Equimark gained
1 to 5 5/8. A group including investors Laurence and Preston
Tisch disclosed that it has a 5.6% stake in Continental and a
6.8% interest in Equimark. Bank of Boston, in which the
Tisches hold an 8.9% stake, advanced 1/2 to 8 3/4.
   Sovran Financial climbed 2 3/4 to 26 1/2 and Citizens &amp;
Southern added 2 3/8 to 21 3/4; the two bank holding
companies are close to completing their merger. Sovran, the
surviving company, is among the S&amp;P 500; as a result,
managers of index funds were adjusting their positions to
reflect the merger's effect on the market capitalization of
Sovran, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   Ohio Edison went up 1/4 to 16 7/8 on 2.7 million shares,
with dividend-related trading among institutions accounting
for the bulk of the activity. The utility stock has an 8.9%
dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today.
   Toys "R" Us dropped 1/8 to 25 3/8 on more than one million
shares. The stock traded as low as 24 1/8 following a report
that 11 Japanese toy retailers are forming an alliance in an
effort to protect themselves against the company's expansion
plans.
   Tonka rose 5/8 to 5 3/4 following a report that investor
Malcolm Glazer has bought about 500,000 of its common shares,
or a 3% stake. Both the company and Mr. Glazer, who has
launched bids for several other companies in the past,
declined to comment.
   Sotheby's Holdings Class A climbed 3/4 to 12 5/8. Its
board authorized the repurchase of as many as three million
Class A shares, or 16.2% of the shares outstanding.
