   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- In a case alleging stockbroker
wrongdoing before the 1987 stock-market crash, a state grand
jury issued 42 indictments each against Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., a former top Shearson broker in Cleveland and
the broker's former branch manager.
   The indictments charge the broker, Sheldon Strauss, with
fraud and false representation in the sale of securities. The
state said Mr. Strauss's clients suffered extensive losses in
the 1987 crash because of "heavily margined, speculative and
unauthorized investments" he made "with the full knowledge of
his supervisors at Shearson Lehman."

   The former branch manager, Stephen Weinberg, and Shearson
were also named in the indictments for their alleged
complicity in Mr. Strauss's actions, the state said.
   Shearson, a New York-based brokerage concern, has already
settled more than $4.9 million of claims with Mr. Strauss's
former clients, the state said.
   A spokesman for Shearson, a unit of New York-based
American Express Co., said allegations that Shearson had
complicity are "totally without merit," even though the
alleged activity "didn't serve the best interest" of its
clients.
   The spokesman said the Messrs. Strauss and Weinberg no
longer work for Shearson -- Shearson dismissed Mr. Strauss in
late 1987 and Mr. Weinberg resigned in early 1988 -- and
noted that the alleged activity occured nearly three years
ago.
   In magazine and newspaper interviews over the past several
months, Mr. Strauss has acknowledged wiping out himself and
his clients in the 1987 stock crash, but he said Shearson is
as much to blame as him. He has said he wanted to "devote
whatever meager resources I have" to help investors sue their
brokerage firms in cases of improper sales techniques.
