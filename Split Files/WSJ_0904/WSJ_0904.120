   Kroger Co., Cincinnati, said it bought 25 Detroit area
supermarkets, plus four others under construction, from
Meadowdale Foods Inc., Detroit.
   Kroger said Foodland Distributors, Livonia, Mich., which
currently supplies Kroger's Michigan supermarkets, purchased
Meadowdale's Abner Wolf Distributors wholesale operations,
and will supply the newly acquired Kroger stores. Those
stores, previously operated under the Great Scott] name, will
adopt the Kroger name.

   Sources close to the transaction said Meadowdale received
$74 million for the operations. Kroger didn't disclose how
much of that was for the stores it purchased.
   The purchase will double the number of Kroger stores in
the Detroit area. The supermarket and drugstore chain
previously operated 54 stores in Michigan, 29 of them in the
Detroit area.
