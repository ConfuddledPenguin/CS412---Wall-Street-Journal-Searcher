   SAN DIEGO -- Computer &amp; Communications Technology Corp.
said shareholders overwhelmingly approved its merger with
closely held Sunward Technologies.
   Everett Bahre, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of Computer &amp; Communications, said 65% of the
company's shares were represented in the voting. Some 99% of
those shares were cast in favor of giving Sunward holders 55%
majority control of Computer &amp; Communications.

   To accomplish that, Computer &amp; Communications will issue
14.5 million new shares to Sunward holders. However, the
merged company will adopt the Sunward name. Both companies
make magnetic recording heads for computer disk drives and
are based in San Diego.
   Greg Reyes was elected chairman and chief executive
officer of the new Sunward Technologies. Mr. Reyes said the
new firm had completed the private sale of preferred stock
and warrants to purchase about 3.8 million Sunward shares for
an aggregate purchase price of $5 million.
