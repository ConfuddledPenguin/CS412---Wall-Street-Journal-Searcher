   Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J.P. Morgan, testifying
on June 28 to the House subcommittee on financial
institutions:

   Today, sophisticated users of funds search the globe to
find the most efficient way to finance their business. One
day the Eurobond market might offer the best opportunity;
another day the syndicated loan market; still another day a
securities issue in the U.S. capital markets might be most
attractive. . . . These financial products are now so closely
related that in the real world they cannot be separated. No
one in the markets, and no client, treats them as distinct --
except when forced by U.S. law to do so.
