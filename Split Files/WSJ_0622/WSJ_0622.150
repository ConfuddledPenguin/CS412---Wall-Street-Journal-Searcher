   CHICAGO -- Prices of hog and pork belly futures contracts
continued to sink from their superheated levels amid
scattered signs that supermarkets and food companies are
cutting back their purchases.
   Because of soaring wholesale prices this winter and
spring, retailers have had to push up the price of many
pork-related food items to record levels. Demand initially
remained strong for pork despite the higher prices because
consumers had little alternative for a red meat; beef prices
have also been setting record highs.

   In recent weeks, however, some grocery store chains have
begun promoting cheaper meats, such as turkey, as an
alternative to high-priced pork and beef.
   In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the pork belly contract for July delivery dropped its maximum
daily limit of two cents a pound to settle at 61.4 cents a
pound.
   The price for a pork belly, which is sliced to make bacon,
is still high. Yesterday's settlement price is 83% higher
than the price that the July contract was trading at a year
ago.
   Prices of hogs and pork bellies climbed through the winter
and spring because the supply of hogs ready for slaughter had
shriveled, kicking off fierce competition among
slaughterhouses to buy them.
   All this was the delayed effect of drought-related damage
to the 1988 grain harvests. The profitability of feeding hogs
shrank as grain grew more expensive. Producers began trimming
the number of piglets born on their farms, resulting in a
tight supply of mature hogs this year.
   Because of the backlash from consumers, many analysts are
reasoning that hog and pork belly prices have peaked for the
year. However, many of those same analysts are predicting
that hog and pork belly prices might regain some ground this
summer because it is the season in which the supply of fat
hogs is tightest.
   Where prices go after that hinges on how fast hog farmers
rebuild their herds. One indication of that will come next
Friday when the Agriculture Department is slated to release
its quarterly survey of hog farmers.
   Some analysts expect the government to report that the
number of new pigs born this spring continued a year-to-year
decline that started several quarters ago, which would signal
that hog prices might remain relatively high for several more
months. It takes about six months to raise a hog for
slaughter.
   Tom O'Hare, a livestock analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., said he expects the government to report that
the total number of hogs on June 1 was down 3% from a year
earlier.
   Prices of cattle futures contracts settled mixed and
slightly changed.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices fell. The September contract was off
$59 a metric ton to $1,204. Trading was largely on a
technical basis, according to one analyst who said selling by
dealers depressed prices. As the September contract fell
below $1,240 and then $1,220, the drop accelerated as selling
orders waiting at those levels were touched off, the analyst
said. However, at its low of $1,201, the September contract
leveled off as demand developed. Concern about the 1990-91
season's supplies has eased, the analyst said, as growing
weather in West Africa and Brazil, the major growing areas,
continues to be excellent. Another analyst observed that the
market has resumed its downward trend because of abundant
supplies, after climbing in reaction to the Ivory Coast's
political turmoil. The Ivory Coast is the world's leading
cocoa producer, but the turmoil never disrupted the cocoa
industry.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices recovered after two days of
declines. The July contract was up 0.75 cent a pound to
$1.1060. In the previous two sessions, July dropped a total
of 4.05 cents. Wednesday's sell-off of over three cents a
pound was exaggerated as traders overreacted to estimates
that London Metal Exchange warehouse supplies of copper might
rise as much as 30,000 tons over the next three weeks, one
analyst said. Estimates now are that exchange copper
inventories to be announced today will be practically
unchanged, the analyst said. The U.S. gross national product
for the first quarter was a little better than expected,
rising 1.9%, vs. a gain of about 1.3% generally forecast, he
said. However, overall, the economic picture doesn't continue
to favor copper at the moment, he said. In particular, he
noted slowdowns in the automotive and housing industries,
major users of copper.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: The July contract extended Wednesday's
strong advance, and deferred months rebounded from recent
declines. July ended with a gain of 5.15 cents a pound at
$1.7915, which increased the July contract's premium over
September by two cents to 7.30 cents. September was up 3.15
cents to $1.7185. With the cash price for the concentrate at
over $2 a pound, well above the futures market, processors
who have bought contracts may seek to take delivery against
July contracts, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. The first day for the issuance of delivery notices is
July 2. Many traders who previously sold contracts short in
anticipation of price declines are speculators and
computer-guided funds, neither of which are likely to deliver
the commodity and instead may have to buy back contracts, she
said.
