   WASHINGTON -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said a
discount package of long-distance services went into effect
for Resort Condominiums International after the Federal
Communications Commission allowed a suspension period to
lapse.
   The FCC had suspended the special discounts for the
vacation time-share company in January while the commission
investigated the legality of cut-rate custom-tailored
packages. At the time, the agency said it was also
investigating an equivalent offer from MCI Communications
Corp.

   The FCC could still declare the AT&amp;T offer, known as
Tariff 15, illegal, but the decision to let the suspension
expire signaled that the agency may allow AT&amp;T to offer
special discounts to meet competition.
   "We find it very exciting because we fought so hard for
it," said Joseph Nacchio, AT&amp;T vice president-marketing for
business communications services. Nevertheless, he
acknowledged that he would have preferred an affirmative
decision from the agency. The tariff for Resort Condominiums
was originally filed nine months ago.
   The company has made about six other filings under Tariff
15, including discount services for CBS Inc., PepsiCo Inc.,
and La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.
