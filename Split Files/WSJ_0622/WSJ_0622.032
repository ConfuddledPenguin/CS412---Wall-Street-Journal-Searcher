   Your June 1 editorial criticizing my role in Mikhail
Gorbachev's cancellation of his scheduled visit to the Hoover
Institution gives Hoover too little credit.
   If the Hoover Fellows had been able to contain themselves,
and not publicly gloat over the prospect of Mr. Gorbachev
coming hat in hand to the tower of anti-communism for advice
on how to save his failed country, I would not have written
my letter, and Hoover would not have ended up looking silly.
No self-respecting head of state of a proud nation would
knowingly walk into such a trap. All I did was help point it
out to him.
