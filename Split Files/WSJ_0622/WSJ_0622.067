   CHICAGO -- A defense attorney blamed "ambiguous" trading
rules for any alleged problems in this city's futures trading
pits and criticized the government for singling out three
futures traders for prosecution under those rules.
   If federal prosecutors don't like the way futures trading
is conducted, "let them change the damn rules; don't put Bob
Mosky in jail because of it," said Elliot Samuels, an
attorney for Robert Mosky, one of three Swiss franc futures
traders charged with fraud who are on trial here in federal
court.

   Defense attorneys for all three traders also maintained
that futures trading is so complex and hectic that the
undercover federal agent who posed as a trader in 1988
regularly bumbled his own trades and frequently misunderstood
what was going on around him.
   They also attempted to raise questions in the jurors'
minds about the integrity of the agent, Randall Jannett,
saying he appeared to ignore evidence that the three accused
traders had abided by the rules of their profession. The
attorneys made their comments in closing arguments to the
jury in the seven-week trial.
   Prosecutors argued that the defendants repeatedly stole
from customers to avoid costly trading errors and to pad
their incomes. Fraudulent trading in the Swiss franc pit by
the defendants was "systematic and longstanding," said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly.
   Mr. Mosky and the other two traders, Danny Scheck and
David Zatz, were indicted last year for allegedly stealing
from futures trading customers in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's Swiss franc futures trading pit.
   Forty-five other individuals also were indicted last year
as a result of a federal undercover investigation of futures
trading at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. The three
Swiss franc futures traders are the first of the indicted
traders to go on trial.
   The central issue of the trial is the "open outcry" rule,
which requires that all futures trades be made "openly and
competitively" in an exchange trading pit, Mr. Samuels said.
But the lack of a concise definition for this rule has left
the defendants open to prosecution for following pit customs
and practices that allow traders to survive in the frantic
trading atmosphere, he said.
   Throughout the trial the defense attorneys hammered away
at Mr. Jannett's repeated claims that he observed and at
times covertly tape-recorded the defendants making
non-competitive trades. They also assailed as unreliable
evidence given by two traders who earlier pleaded guilty to
reduced fraud charges in return for providing evidence
against the three accused traders.
   The defense attorneys maintained that many of those
alleged non-competitive trades were actually two traders
confirming the details of trades made earlier that the agent
had failed to notice or record. Other examples of alleged
illegality were instances of traders resolving errors by
following pit practice of so-called local or independent
traders, resolving errors in favor of brokers who handle
customer orders, the attorneys said.
   The government contends that locals were passed
non-competitive winning trades to compensate for absorbing
such losses from brokers.
   Commodity regulations are "vague rules subject to
different interpretations," Mr. Samuels said. "This is life
in the pits. It's not pleasant, it's not serene, its not
pretty, but things get done."
   To try to underscore their argument that futures trading
is a frenetically paced business and difficult for outsiders
to comprehend, the defense attorneys offered a 20-minute
videotape of trading in the Swiss franc pit as their sole
defense. The unnarrated tape showed numerous examples of
traders leaping over each other to complete transactions and
frantically sorting through piles of orders.
   "The very complexity of the issues raised in this case
raises a reasonable doubt all by itself" as to the guilt of
the defendants, said Alan Blumenthal, Mr. Zatz's attorney.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner described such an
argument as a "Wizard of Oz" defense. It suggests "mere
mortals" such as federal agents or jurors will never be able
to understand the workings of a futures pit, he said. Accept
that, he told the jury, and "being a member of the Merc means
you can never be convicted" of fraudulent trading.
