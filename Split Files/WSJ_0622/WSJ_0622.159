   AN EARTHQUAKE SHATTERED northern Iran, killing thousands
of people.
   Iranian officials said at least 25,000 were killed and
tens of thousands injured, adding that the toll probably will
rise as rescuers reach remote areas. The quake demolished
towns in the densely populated Caspian Sea region and buried
people asleep in their homes. The temblor measured as high as
7.7 on the Richter scale. A dozen or more aftershocks hit the
region within two hours of the initial quake, which was at
least as bad as the one that struck Iran in 1978. Landslides
obstructed rescuers on the ground, and bad weather hindered
airlift operations. In Tehran, the quake sent people fleeing
into the streets, but no deaths were reported there.

   THE JUSTICES RULED hiring decisions can't be made on the
basis of party ties.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court said party affiliation
can no longer be used to determine who is hired or promoted
for most government jobs. The court, in a devastating blow to
patronage, said First Amendment rights of government workers
are violated if they are denied promotions, transfers or
recalls from layoffs because of party ties. The justices said
partisanship may play a role in employment decisions only
when party affiliation is an appropriate requirement.
   The court, in an Ohio case, ruled that the First Amendment
doesn't make the news media immune from libel lawsuits based
on statements of opinion.

   The House killed a proposed constitutional amendment
barring flag desecration, an outcome that seemed unlikely
when the Supreme Court threw out the federal flag-protection
law 10 days ago. The lawmakers voted 254-177 in favor of the
amendment, but that was over 30 votes short of the two-thirds
majority required.

   West Germany will seek historic political concessions from
the Soviets today in Berlin in negotiations involving the two
Germanys and the four victorious World War II powers. At the
same time, the Bonn government will be approving a $2.98
billion bank credit to Moscow.

   The two Germanys' legislatures voted to approve an
economic merger that could set the stage for unification as
early as December. Lawmakers, meeting simultaneously in Bonn
and East Berlin, adopted a state treaty introducing the West
German mark as their common currency July 1.

   Soviet officials are spreading the word that they are
moving nuclear warheads out of volatile southern republics
and into storage areas in the Russian Republic. Transfer of
the weapons is being done not out of fear of foreign attack
but because of concern that a nuclear warhead could fall into
the wrong hands internally.

   Mandela spoke at Yankee Stadium in New York and called for
new investment in South Africa, adding that "some form of
state participation" will be necessary. The black nationalist
leader plans to reassure the U.S. business community today
that a South Africa led by the ANC would protect private
investments.

   Shamir urged the U.S. to permanently end talks with the
PLO. The Israeli prime minister toned down his initially
elated response to Bush's suspension of talks. Palestinians
marched in West Bank cities to protest the U.S. move, and the
State Department warned Americans abroad, especially in the
Mideast, to exercise caution.

   Canada's Prime Minister Mulroney asked Newfoundlanders to
help rescue a constitutional amendment that is aimed at
keeping French-speaking Quebec in Canada's federation. The
ratification deadline for the socalled Meech Lake agreement
is tomorrow, with Newfoundland and Manitoba still to take
action on the amendment.

   Researchers presented papers at an international AIDS
conference in San Francisco that ends this weekend, but the
progress reports on AIDS drugs were mixed. Data presented on
one antibody for AIDS showed that the drug appears to be
nontoxic to patients, but it has yet to show signs of
effectiveness.

   The Senate failed to override Bush's veto of legislation
that would have eased restrictions on political activity for
federal employees. Opponents fell two votes short of the
two-thirds margin needed to overcome the veto. The bill would
have revised the Hatch Act to remove curbs on campaign
activities for federal and postal workers.

   A House committee approved a $15.8 billion foreign
operations bill for fiscal 1991 that would cut U.S. military
aid outside the Mideast and impose curbs on funds for El
Salvador and non-Communist forces in Cambodia. The measure
reflects a temporary accord between the administration and
Democrats in Congress.

week on anti-government demonstrators.

   A local prosecutor began a criminal investigation in West
Germany of former East German Communist leader Honecker and
reports that he harbored leftist terrorists sought in the
West. Honecker has denied the accusations, which increased
after this month's arrests in East Germany of nine reputed
members of the Red Army Faction.
