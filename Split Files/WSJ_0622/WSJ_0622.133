   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM/UA Communications Co. and Pathe
Communications Corp. revised and extended their agreement for
the movie studio to be acquired by Pathe, writing another
chapter in MGM/UA's two-year saga to sell itself.
   The two companies reached a $1.31 billion merger agreement
under which MGM/UA holders wouldn't receive the bulk of the
payment for their shares until October. A small interim
payment is designed to partly compensate for the latest
delay.

   A $20-a-share tender offer launched in March for all of
MGM/UA's 61 million shares was set to expire tomorrow after
being set back several times.
   Under the new agreement, holders of common and preferred
would receive a total of $21.50 a share, of which $4 would be
paid July 20. Closing of the transaction and payment of the
remaining $17.50 a share is expected on or before Oct. 23.
Time Warner Inc. said its agreement with Pathe to guarantee
or provide outright $650 million of the original $1.2 billion
purchase price remains intact. Pathe has been trying to
persuade the New York-based entertainment and publishing
giant to ease the terms under which the financial backing was
promised.
   "We assume the purpose of Pathe's obtaining the {deadline}
extension is to continue our discussions, and we are
continuing them," a Time Warner spokeswoman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
MGM/UA shares fell 12.5 cents to $16.50, Pathe shares were
unchanged at $3.875, and Time Warner shares fell $1.75 to
$104.
   It appeared this week that Pathe's acquisition of MGM/UA
was near collapse amid reports that negotiations between
Pathe and Time Warner were deadlocked. Pathe has had trouble
raising about $450 million in equity to meet terms of its
agreement with Time Warner. Pathe is arguing that loans it
has obtained from Comfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based
affiliate of Pathe principal Giancarlo Parretti, meet Time
Warner's requirement.
   Analysts have raised serious questions about the
Comfinance financing package, which includes a mix of asset
sales and short-term loans from overseas lenders.
   For example, Banque Arabe et Internationale
d'Investissement is supposed to provide a $75 million
one-week line of credit to Comfinance and a $10 million
credit line to a Pathe affiliate. A further $50 million is to
come from an advance by Amsterdam-based PAN-ASS B.V. from a
proposed sale of certain assets by Comfinance to a PAN-ASS
affiliate. And $91 million would be advanced to a Pathe
affiliate by Deepbridge B.V., Amsterdam.
   Under the revised pact, holders will keep the $4-a-share
payment they receive in July even if the merger isn't
completed, a Pathe spokesman said. The payment will be made
in part from an escrow account into which Pathe has already
deposited $200 million. Pathe is required to deposit into the
account an additional $53 million by July 16; $50 million
more by Aug. 21; and a further $50 million by Sept. 20.
   Tracinda Corp., a holding company through which financier
Kirk Kerkorian controls MGM/UA, has agreed to vote for the
modified Pathe acquisition, which is structured as a merger
rather than a tender offer.
   MGM/UA announced in April 1988 that it formed a committee
to consider the company's possible sale. Since then, several
deals have collapsed. Later that year, talks with Sony Corp.,
the Japanese consumer electronics giant, fell apart over
price. Last September, MGM/UA turned down a $1.4 billion bid
from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in favor of a $1.5 billion
offer from Qintex Australia Ltd. That deal foundered in
October after Qintex failed to deliver a $50 million letter
of credit.
