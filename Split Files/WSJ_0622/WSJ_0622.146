   LONDON -- The credit-rating concern IBCA Ltd., London,
said it lowered its ratings on debt of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corp., citing general financial performance and
uncertainties associated with the takeover of Hong Kong by
China in 1997.
   IBCA, which publishes ratings on U.S. and foreign banks,
lowered its individual rating of the Hong Kong-based banking
company to B from AB and its long-term rating to AA-minus
from AA. The short-term rating was unchanged.

   The changeover in control of the British colony "is going
to be difficult, and especially so for Hongkong Bank, the
largest in the territory, which is seen by many as British,"
IBCA said.
   The bank owns Marine Midland Bank in the U.S. and United
Kingdom stock brokerage firm James Capel &amp; Co., but "despite
this diversification, the bank remains heavily dependent on
its domestic base for the bulk of its earnings," the report
said.
