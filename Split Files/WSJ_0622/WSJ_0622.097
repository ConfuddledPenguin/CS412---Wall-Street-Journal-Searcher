   WARREN, N.J. -- John L. Ufheil was named president and
chief executive officer of Celgene Corp., succeeding Louis
Fernandez in those posts. Mr. Fernandez was named chairman of
the biotechnology concern but expects to retire next year.
   Mr. Ufheil, 56 years old, is the former chief operating
officer of Mallinckrodt Inc., a medical products and
specialty chemicals unit of International Minerals and
Chemical Corp., Northbrook, Ill. A company spokesman said the
change in leadership is part of a transition planned by Mr.
Fernandez, 66, when he became president of Celgene at the
company's inception in 1986. Celgene was spun off from the
former Celanese Corp. before it merged with the U.S. unit of
Hoechst AG of West Germany. Mr. Fernandez, the spokesman
said, plans to retire from Celgene next year.
