   ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc., in a move to bolster its already
strong position in the information-services industry, said it
agreed in principle to acquire Telecredit Inc. in a stock
swap valued at about $580 million.
   Equifax, a major provider of credit reports and similar
information for retailers, banks and insurers, said the
transaction would be handled as a tax-free merger, in which
each share of Telecredit will be convertible to 2.69 shares
of Equifax common stock.

   Telecredit, based in Los Angeles, said a week ago that it
was talking with several companies about a possible business
combination. That news sent the company's stock soaring
earlier this week, closing as high as $53.25 a share on
Wednesday.
   Yesterday, however, Telecredit closed at $50.75 a share,
down $2.50 in heavy national over-the-counter trading.
Equifax's shares, meanwhile, dropped sharply after the
companies announced their merger plan and finished the day at
$19.50 a share, off $2.625, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   "The market was hoping for (an acquisition price of) about
$60 a share," said Joseph A. Stieven, an analyst at Stifel,
Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St. Louis. But with Equifax trading at
$19.50 a share, each Telecredit share has an indicated value
of about $52.50.
   The planned merger was applauded by many analysts, who
said the companies would make a good fit. While Equifax,
which controls about 40% of the $1.5 billion credit-reporting
business in the U.S., evaluates risk from a distance,
Telecredit, through its primary business of guaranteeing
personal checks, places itself at the center of consumers'
financial transactions.
   Retailers and other merchants use Telecredit's check
service to verify customers' checks. If a check bounces after
Telecredit approves it, the company "purchases" the check
from the retailer. Dominating the market, Telecredit
guarantees more than $7 billion of checks annually.
   The other major part of Telecredit's business is
credit-card and debit-card processing services, mainly for
MasterCard and Visa transactions. The company's customers are
1,700 credit unions and small and medium-sized financial
institutions that don't process their own credit-card
payments.
   In the year ended April 30, 1989, Telecredit posted net
income of $24.9 million, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of
$158.7 million. For the nine months ended Jan. 31, the
company had net income of $21.9 million, or $1.98 a share, on
revenue of $129.2 million.
   "Companies like Equifax are trying to find ways to add
value to their services," said James Dougherty, an analyst at
County NatWest USA in New York. Joining Telecredit's data
base and operations with Equifax's, he added, "will give
Equifax the opportunity to sell a lot of different services."
   Mr. Dougherty estimated that costs associated with the
merger will reduce Equifax's earnings this year to between 95
cents and $1 a share, down about nine cents from his earlier
projections. In 1989, Equifax had net income of $35.7
million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $840.3 million.
   C.B. Rogers Jr., president and chief executive officer of
Equifax, said earnings dilution of nine cents is "in the
ballpark," but would be "no higher than that." In 1991, he
added, "We're hoping, with some effort, to see no dilution."
   Mr. Rogers said the companies had begun talks about two
months ago. He said he doesn't anticipate any changes in
management or any layoffs as a result of the merger.
   The proposed merger, among other conditions, is subject to
negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement between
the two companies and approval by their boards and
shareholders. Mr. Rogers said he hopes the merger can be
completed by late August.
