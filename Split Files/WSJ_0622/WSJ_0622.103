   CHICAGO -- Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. paid
$30,000 to settle Chicago Board of Trade allegations that it
violated exchange trading rules.
   Under the settlement, the brokerage unit of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co., New York, didn't admit or deny the violations. The
CBOT said it had "reason to believe" Merrill Lynch floor
clerks disclosed "the possibility of a customer order" to a
trader for the company's Government Securities unit before
the order was initiated and entered in the trading pit.

   Prior knowledge of a big pending order can enable traders
to profit from the market effect of the order, and is known
as "front running."
   Merrill Lynch said that it settled the action to avoid the
expenses of a protracted legal proceeding, and that it is
"confident that the trade at issue was executed competitively
and in a manner consistent with the best interests of our
customer."
   In December, Merrill Lynch paid a $250,000 CBOT fine,
without admitting or denying the allegations, for executing
non-member trades as trades for the firm, a practice that
reduced the fees it paid the exchange. In that case, Merrill
Lynch also agreed to pay the CBOT "certain fees and
expenses," which one source said totaled $2.9 million.
