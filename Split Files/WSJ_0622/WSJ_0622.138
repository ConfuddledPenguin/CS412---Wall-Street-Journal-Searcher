   Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York, said it agreed to
lease space for its London offices from Olympia &amp; York in the
Canary Wharf 50-story office tower.
   The banking concern said it plans to move about 1,000
employees in commercial banking, corporate finance and
investment banking, to seven floors, or about 200,000 square
feet, in the tower in 1992 or 1993. Manufacturers Hanover
said the move would allow it to put its London operations in
one building. The bank currently occupies six offices in
various areas of London.
