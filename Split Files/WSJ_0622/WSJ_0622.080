   NEW YORK -- A group of 12 media companies with interests
in broadcasting and cable are asking Congress not to ban the
sale of television programs on an exclusive basis to program
distributors, principally cable operators.
   The move by the Media Group, which includes Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., Cox Communications Inc., Viacom Inc. and
Times-Mirror Co., is the latest round in the increasingly
heated debate over so-called program-exclusivity rights. That
debate intensified earlier this week when Tele-Communications
Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, asked the NBC
network if Tele-Communications' cable systems could receive
programming now provided exclusively to NBC broadcast
affiliates.

   National Broadcasting Co, a subsidiary of General Electric
Co., hasn't responded to the request. But the 12 companies
who made yesterday's appeal to the House subcommittee on
telecommunications are fighting provisions in proposed cable
re-regulation legislation that would eliminate the
exclusivity rights and instead require cable programmers to
sell shows to any entity willing to pay for them.
   If the bill passes, for example, Cable News Network, the
all-news cable network owned by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., would be required to sell its two services, CNN and
Headline News, to cable's budding competitor, direct-to-home
satellite TV.
   Under current legislation, cable programmers can make
exclusive arrangements, declining to sell shows to other
program distributors. A cable operator serving an assigned
area can secure the exclusive rights for such popular cable
programming as Home Box Office or TNT, Turner's all-movie
channel, for that region.
   NBC has been lobbying heavily to eliminate the exclusivity
rules, largely because it is a partner in Sky Cable, a
venture that would deliver programs via satellite directly to
homes. Cable companies want to keep the exclusivity rules in
place, and are opposed to Sky Cable because it would deliver
programs now exclusive to cable. One NBC executive speculated
that Tele-Communications' request to let cable systems carry
programming now provided exclusively to NBC affiliates is a
"ploy" to pressure the network to drop its legislative
efforts to eliminate the exclusivity rules.
   A Media Group spokesman said the group was formed in March
"in an attempt to resolve the differences between the
broadcasting and cable industries."
   Asked why Capital Cities/ABC, which owns a TV network, TV
stations and stakes in three cable networks, sided with the
Media Group, Mark MacCarthy, the company's vice-president of
government affairs, said, "It made good political sense. As
broadcasters, we benefit everyday by program exclusivity,
either by entertainment shows or sports. Program exclusivity
is a common practice that we want to promote."
