   NEW YORK -- Wall Street has a message for Washington:
Leave arbitration alone.
   In a letter to the nation's stock exchanges, securities
executives strongly objected to a recent request by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to give investors more
flexibility in bringing arbitration cases against their
brokers.

   The SEC is urging Wall Street securities firms to give
investors the option of bringing disputes with brokers to
independent arbitration forums, rather than limiting them to
industry-subsidized arbitration panels.
   Wall Street's position, given in a letter by the
Securities Industry Association, is sure to anger some
investors and fuel the controversy over whether arbitration
stacks the deck against the little guy. The SEC says that
giving investors flexibility would help allay investor
concerns of unfairness -- allegations long denied by the
securities industry.
   "The industry is wrong here," says David Robbins, a former
arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange who
currently works for a New York law firm. "It's bad enough
that access to court is foreclosed, let alone a forum with no
allegiance to the securities industry."
   Many investors sign a standard agreement when they open an
account that binds them to go to arbitration, instead of
court, in the event of a dispute with their broker.
Currently, most investors are required by their agreements to
take their cases to industry-sponsored forums -- particularly
the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New
York Stock Exchange. These panels are typically made up of
three arbitrators, including one securities executive and
sometimes others with ties to Wall Street.
   The SIA contends that the SEC lacks jurisdiction over
arbitration panels that aren't sponsored by the securities
industry. Moreover, the SIA says a 1987 Supreme Court
decision -- which held that securities firms could compel
investors to take disputes to arbitration -- might make cases
decided by independent panels unenforceable.
   Besides, the SIA says, the cost to Wall Street for just
changing its brokerage-account forms would approach $4
million.
   What about the perception that the industry's position
crimps the small investor?
   Industry-sponsored arbitration panels "generally produce
good results," argues John T. Shinkle, chairman of the SIA's
federal regulation committee and general counsel at Salomon
Brothers Inc., who cosigned the SIA letter. "There's no
reason to question that."
   Investors win about half the time at exchange-sponsored
arbitration forums. That compares with about 60% at the
American Arbitration Association -- the major independent
forum that is privately funded and widely perceived to be the
most sympathetic to investors.
   The SIA has long encouraged its 600 member firms to
consider using the AAA in customer agreements with
arbitration clauses. But many Wall Street firms still balk.
   For its part, the SEC declined to comment on the
industry's position because it hadn't seen the letter. The
agency only wants to make arbitration "as fair and efficient
as possible," says Mark Fitterman, associate director of the
SEC's division of market regulation.
