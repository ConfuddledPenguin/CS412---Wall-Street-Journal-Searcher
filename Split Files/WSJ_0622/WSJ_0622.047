   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee voted to limit windfall
profits available to certain manufacturers of drugs for rare
diseases, but it excluded two drugs from the measure after
furious lobbying by Genentech Inc. and Amgen Inc.
   The bill, approved 6-4, would modify a 1983 law that gives
the Food and Drug Administration authority to grant
seven-year monopolies to manufacturers of drugs for diseases
that affect fewer than 200,000 people. The law was intended
to encourage companies to produce drugs that would otherwise
be unprofitable. But consumer groups and rival drug companies
have complained that in rare cases the law has enabled a few
"orphan drug" manufacturers to reap large monopoly profits on
a few orphan drugs.

   The House bill would deny market exclusivity in cases
where a rival drug company can demonstrate it developed the
same drug simultaneously. But under a compromise offered by
Rep. Bill Richardson (D., N.M.), drugs that are approved or
on the verge of being approved by the FDA before Aug. 15
would be exempt.
   As a result, Genentech's human growth hormone and Amgen's
EPO would retain orphan drug status. Human growth hormone is
used to treat dwarfism. EPO, made by Thousand Oaks,
Calif.-based Amgen is used to treat anemia in kidney dialysis
patients.
   "The bill was substantially improved by the subcommittee's
actions," said David Beier, vice president, government
affairs, for Genentech, based in South San Francisco, Calif.
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
health subcommittee, was less enthusiastic. "Those in favor
of the status quo as it exists were able to keep that status
quo for themselves," he said. But Mr. Waxman eventually
supported the compromise bill.
   The bill, which is opposed by the Bush administration,
maintains a provision that would deny orphan drug status for
drugs whose market expands beyond 200,000. This is intended
to deny unforeseen profits to manufacturers of drugs for
diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, whose
patient populations exceed initial estimates.
   Among those companies most likely to be affected by this
provision is Lyphomed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill. The number of
patients using Lyphomed's aerosol pentamidine, used to treat
AIDS-related pneumonia, is rapidly approaching 200,000.
   The measure now goes to the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. In the Senate, a similar bill, introduced by Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), is expected to be considered
next month.
