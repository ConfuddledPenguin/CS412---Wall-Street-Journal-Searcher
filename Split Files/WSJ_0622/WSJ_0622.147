   Apple Computer Inc. said its top U.S. sales executive is
moving to part-time status barely a year after the computer
maker gave him a huge compensation package to keep him from
bolting to a competitor. The move is part of a continuing
shake-up of Apple's domestic sales and marketing
organization, which has been under fire this year because of
weak revenue growth.
   Apple said Michael Dionne, vice president of Apple's
Southwestern sales operations, will succeed William B.
Coldrick as senior vice president, sales, for Apple USA. Mr.
Coldrick has been with Apple since 1982.

   People familiar with the situation said Mr. Coldrick had
been eased out of his job by Michael H. Spindler, who took
over daily management of Apple in February and is said to be
disappointed with the company's domestic sales and marketing
performance.
   Only a year ago, Mr. Coldrick was considered so valuable
to Apple that the Cupertino, Calif., company gave him a $2.1
million compensation package rather than lose him to a
competitor.
   However, in an interview Mr. Coldrick denied he had been
stripped of his position, saying he informed Apple 18 months
ago of his plans to reduce his workload. "After 25 years in
the computer industry, I came to the decision that my
personal life and my family were going to take priority,"
said Mr. Coldrick, 48 years old.
   Mr. Coldrick declined to comment on why Apple would offer
him a huge compensation package last year if it knew of his
intentions.
   Apple is looking to hire a president of Apple USA, its
domestic sales and marketing organization. In January, Allan
Z. Loren was ousted from that position, and it has been
vacant since.
   Mr. Loren's departure and the diminution of Mr. Coldrick's
role raise questions about the scope of the role played by
John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer. Recently, Mr.
Sculley said at a software conference that he planned to
spend the next two years overseeing Apple's
product-development activities, indicating that Mr. Spindler
would sort out the company's sales and marketing problems.
   Messrs. Loren and Coldrick were loyalists of Mr. Sculley,
himself a marketing whiz during his tenure at PepsiCo. But
successive years of lackluster marketing campaigns by Apple
have prompted Mr. Sculley to turn to Mr. Spindler, credited
with energizing Apple's European business, for sales sizzle.
Mr. Spindler, who is considered likely to go outside Apple
for a new president of Apple USA, is likely to bring more
change to the company.
   But change is something senior executives at Apple are
used to. As Mr. Coldrick observed in a personal note to Mr.
Sculley in February: "Change is always difficult. Change
without chaos is even more difficult to achieve."
