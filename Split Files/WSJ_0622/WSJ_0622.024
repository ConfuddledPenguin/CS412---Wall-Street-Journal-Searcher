   Ann E. Berman's May 24 Leisure &amp; Arts article on the
recent Sotheby's impressionist/post-impressionist auctions is
interesting, not least because it permits a computation of
the return earned by the seller of Renoir's "Au Moulin de la
Galette."
   Ms. Berman states that the seller acquired this painting
in 1929 for $165,000. The selling price ($78.1 million)
includes both the buyer's and the seller's commission, so the
net price to the seller is approximately $64.5 million. Out
of this, taxes must be paid; if the applicable tax rate is
33%, then the after-tax selling price is approximately $43.5
million.

   This is about a 9.56% compound annual rate of return on
the original purchase price, in nominal terms, and before
accounting for any costs of ownership of the painting
(insurance, security costs, conservation, etc.). If we adjust
for inflation, we can express the purchase price in terms of
current prices as about $1.5 million. In real terms, the
compound annual return on the original purchase price is
about 5.67% (again, without adjusting for any costs of
ownership).
   These returns, while decent, are clearly not spectacular.
Given that Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette" is one of the
most famous of his works, this suggests that the pecuniary
returns to ownership of even the best and most famous works
of art probably do not exceed the returns to other
investments.
