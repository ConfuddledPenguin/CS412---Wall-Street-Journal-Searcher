   TOKYO -- As Donald Trump's empire crumbles, the real
estate mogul is turning up his sales pitch to cash-rich
Japanese investors. But Mr. Trump's debt crisis is turning
off Japanese already repelled by his exorbitant prices and
high-handed attitude, Tokyo real estate agents say.
   Mr. Trump's representatives have been frequent fliers to
Japan of late. Earlier this year, Trump saleswomen set up
shop in the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo to promote the Trump
Palace, his condominium project presently under construction
in New York. His luxury cruiser Trump Princess is sailing
Japan's shores, looking for a buyer at an asking price of
$115 million. Mr. Trump himself came to Japan a few months
ago trying unsuccessfully to get help to refinance the Plaza
Hotel, and he personally launched a sales campaign during his
visit.

   But Japan's investors, who in the past rushed to buy into
Trump Tower and Trump Parc for their prime location and
guaranteed name value, are no longer impressed. "There will
be nobody buying now," says a Tokyo real estate agent who
sells Trump real estate.
   Moreover, as Mr. Trump's debt woes deepen and he struggles
to refund some $2 billion of debt, some who already have
bought from him are rethinking their investments. "People
who've actually purchased are quite concerned about what will
happen in the future" to property values, says Wataru
Iwamura, a sales representative for overseas projects at
Haseko Corp., a major Japanese real estate company promoting
Trump properties. "We tell them that if they let go now, that
would be thinking of real estate investment on a much too
short term basis," he adds.
   Even before Mr. Trump's financial troubles came to a boil
this year, his name alone was no longer enough to lure
Japanese investors to pay his high prices in the slumping New
York market, Tokyo agents say. Prices of the Trump Palace
condominiums, which start at around $350,000, are about 50%
more expensive than the average prices of property in the
area.
   "The Japanese have started to study" U.S. real estate
trends, says Seishi Matsuo, general manager of the
international marketing department of Kyodo Advertising
Agency Co. Mr. Trump, he says, "probably hasn't realized
that." The Tokyo company publishes a quarterly magazine
giving tips on foreign real estate investment.
   Others say that Mr. Trump's anti-Japanese rhetoric also
has discouraged Japanese investors from buying his property.
"He sweet-talks the Japanese buyers {in Tokyo} and then
criticizes them in New York," says a Tokyo real estate agent
involved in the sales who declines to be identified.
"Japanese investors aren't stupid. They know what's going
on."
   On a practical level, the agent says, Mr. Trump's
organization has alienated Japanese investors by not
translating contract forms into Japanese, or promptly
answering investors' questions, the agent says.
   To be sure, Japanese investors are still leading the pack
in purchasing Trump Palace property. About 70% to 80% of the
buyers so far have been Japanese, Tokyo agents estimate.
Still, Japanese sales are much lower than the agents'
original estimates, and most of the investors are owners of
small private companies who have little experience in foreign
property. Only a third of the 283 Trump Palace condominiums
have found buyers since going on sale at the end of last year
-- much lower than agents' initial expectations.
   The Japanese hesitancy to invest isn't confined just to
Trump properties or even New York. In the past year, as New
York has fallen out of favor, investors have focused more on
smaller U.S. cities -- particularly Seattle and other West
Coast locales. Still, the magnitude of Japanese investment
has dropped. Although the number of Japanese investments in
U.S. real estate increased in 1989 from the year before, the
total amount invested dropped nearly 11% to $14.77 billion,
according to statistics compiled by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
Europe is also increasingly popular.
   The enormity of Mr. Trump's troubles probably is going to
make investors even more careful about the U.S. real estate
market. "They feel that if someone as big as Trump is going
to fall, they better be cautious about investing in the
U.S.," says Michisaburo Hayashi, president of the Real Estate
Management Research Center in Tokyo.
