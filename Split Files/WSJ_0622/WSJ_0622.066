   BUDAPEST -- In the baroque Budapest Bank building in
Vorosmarty Square, the first stock exchange in post-communist
Eastern Europe opened yesterday.
   Workmen furiously put up gilded brass chandeliers, buffed
shiny marble columns, and completed the elegant effect with
luxurious, deep brown wood paneling.

   Though a struggling securities market has been operating
here for the past seven years, the Budapest Stock Exchange is
Eastern Europe's first regulated stock market. The exchange's
founders thought that the occasion warranted a lavish
ceremony, so 700 of the world's leading bankers and market
makers, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Chairman
Richard Breeden and American Stock Exchange Chairman James
Jones, were invited for a gala lunch and dinner.
   The inauguration of a proper stock exchange marks a
critical turning point in Hungary's rush toward capitalism.
Budapest's new, non-communist government says it hopes to use
the exchange to privatize much of the country's state-owned
industry and to attract foreign investment. Foreigners will
be allowed to buy shares and take profits out of the country
in convertible currencies. American brokerage firms are
preparing to open offices in Budapest.
   But many obstacles must be overcome before the exchange
becomes a serious place to do business. Only a couple of
stocks were ready for listing on opening day -- and Ilona
Hardy, the banker in charge of the Hungarian Securities
Exchange Committee, concedes there will only be about a dozen
equities quoted by the year end.
   The market's long-term future depends on how vigorously
the center-right Hungarian government, which won the
country's first free elections in more than four decades in
March, decides to pursue privatization. So far, the
government has offered only vague verbal support for selling
off state companies. The lack of concrete action leaves many
observers doubting the political will to begin listing many
companies on the exchange.
   "The opening of the new stock market is only a symbol,"
complains Zsigmond Jarai. Mr. Jarai resigned as deputy
finance minister this spring and has taken a job starting in
September with the London firm of James Capel &amp; Co. He fears
that the non-communist rulers will not prove any more
determined than the communists in risking large-scale layoffs
by selling state assets. "To really develop a market, we need
a supply of equities," he says. "That means rapid
privatization. But letting companies operate on an efficient
basis also means large-scale layoffs."
   The 38-year-old Mr. Jarai knows from experience the
daunting difficulties of establishing a capital market. In
1983, as a technocrat whiz kid at the Budapest Bank, he set
up the Soviet bloc's first bond market. On ideological
grounds, Hungary's then-ruling communists vetoed stock
trading because that meant selling equity in the people's
property. Bonds were given the go-ahead because Mr. Jarai
managed to convince the communists that they only represented
a loan.
   The bond market soon stumbled into more than ideological
problems. When it opened, yields were 11%, inflation 7%.
Hungarians rushed to buy. Four years later in 1987, the
government issued an inflation forecast of 15%. Yields still
were at 11%. Hungarians rushed to sell. Prices dropped. The
budding Hungarian bond market crashed.
   Though shaken, Mr. Jarai refused to surrender. He bravely
kept open the bond market, waiting for better times. They
came with Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika. Suddenly, once
firm taboos no longer were so firm, and in 1988, Hungary's
reform-minded communists approved the establishment of a
stock exchange. Mr. Jarai became chairman.
   The problems of the bond market soon paled before the
problems of the nascent stock exchange. Opening sessions
were, to say the least, unimpressive. They took place once a
week in a bland modern office in the International Trade
Center on Vaci Street. A woman stood at the head of the
table, reciting the list of equities. Around the table, the
dealers from state banks sat mute. The woman would read a
name and wait for bids. Often, none came.
   Abuses under the system abounded. Unregistered sales took
place all over the country. Only about 5% of all trading
happened at the weekly Budapest meetings. In one case last
year, a provincial company sold a bundle of shares promising
to pay dividends. When the dividends didn't come, angry
shareholders called for an investigation. It found that the
company didn't even exist.
   "There were no prospectuses, no laws, no trading
committee," said an astounded Mrs. Hardy. "Can you believe
that?"
   The Hungarians now understand that a proper environment
for a stock market has to be created. On March 1, the Act on
Securities and Stock Exchange took effect, calling for a
self-regulating organization, independent of the government.
   Registered brokerage firms are required to have an initial
capital equivalent to at least $2.5 million. To be listed,
companies must offer full financial disclosure. Mrs. Hardy
has been named head of the Securities Exchange Committee, the
Hungarian equivalent of the SEC.
   "The days of no rules, no regulations are over," Mrs.
Hardy said. "We are going to use the same system as in the
West."
   Initial results are promising. This past week, Hungarians
were given a sneak preview of the market when an offering by
Ibusz, a Hungarian tourism company, of the equivalent of $7
million in shares was oversubscribed.
   Many companies plan to exploit the Budapest exchange's
strong ties with the nearby Vienna Stock Exchange. Ibusz, for
example, will be listed in Vienna.
   It will take time until the Budapest market reaches the
level of its Viennese neighbor. Before 1948, when it was
closed, the stock exchange was housed in an impressive and
imposing building across the street from the American
Embassy. Today that building serves as headquarters for
Hungarian television. In any case, Mrs. Hardy says, the new
market no longer needs such large premises; one room will
suffice for the time being.
   "We're just getting started," she said. "We have to get
technicians, specialists, rules and regulations; we have to
learn this business all over again."
   Meanwhile, Tokyo stock prices ended essentially flat in
light trading.
   For the third day in a row, the Nikkei index bounced up
after falling below 32000 points, to finish above 32000
points.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues inched down 0.49 point at
32087.27. The index gained 47.38 points Wednesday.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index was down
363.18 points to 31724.09.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, in line with 415.4 million shares
Wednesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 501-433, while 193
issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues in the first section fell 5.24 points to 2361.56.
   In London, shares finished narrowly mixed amid very little
investor interest with few fresh trading signals.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
0.9 point, while the Financial Times 30 Share Index was up
4.9 points to 1908.3. Volume eased to 415.4 million shares
from 436.8 million shares Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Brussels and Milan; and mixed
in Amsterdam and Zurich. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Manila
and Seoul, lower in Taipei, and mixed in Singapore and
Wellington.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.
