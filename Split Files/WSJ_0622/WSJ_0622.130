   WASHINGTON -- The House killed a proposed constitutional
amendment barring flag desecration, an outcome that seemed
unlikely when the Supreme Court threw out the federal
flag-protection law 10 days ago.
   After a long day of speeches defending the flag, the
Constitution or both, the lawmakers voted 254-177 in favor of
the amendment, but that was more than 30 votes short of the
two-thirds majority required.

   Proponents of the amendment were confident last week that
they would muster the votes for passage. This week, however,
the amendment lost momentum when the House Judiciary
Committee sent it to the floor without a recommendation. Then
on Wednesday, the Rules Committee voted to bring the measure
to the floor yesterday, denying proponents time they said
they needed to round up additional votes.
   Also helping opponents of the amendment was the
introduction of a bill that would outlaw flag desecration
likely to cause violence. The proposed statute was narrowly
drafted to try to fall within exceptions to the First
Amendment that the Supreme Court has already carved out.
While it was ultimately defeated, 236-178, after the
amendment failed, it gave opponents of the amendment a chance
to cast a vote for the flag.
   Charges of political maneuvering were leveled by both
sides. "What is at stake," said Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas),
an opponent of the amendment, "is the self-respect of every
member of the House." Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said
"history will regard this as a paroxysm of fear" should the
amendment pass.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.), a sponsor
of the amendment, said that the measure should be voted "up
or down" without considering the proposed statute.
   Opponents pointed out that the amendment would be the
first substantive change in the Bill of Rights since its
incorporation into the Constitution 200 years ago. But Rep
Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) countered: "You would think we were
burning the Bill of Rights. Nothing could be further from the
truth."
   But the strength of the anti-amendment vote indicates that
the opposition strategy -- to paint the issue as the flag vs.
the Bill of Rights -- was successful.
   The negative votes reached 145, the number necessary to
defeat the measure, 10 minutes into the 15 minutes allotted
for the vote. When a vote passes or fails well before the
time allotted, undecided members are given a political
windfall, allowing them to take the safer political route.
   Addressing the House late in the day, Speaker Thomas Foley
(D., Wash.) encouraged opponents of the bill to resist
political pressure to pass the amendment. He pictured the
vote as a non-partisan issue and appealed directly to
Republicans for support. "If it is not conservative to
protect the Bill of Rights," he said, "I do not know what
conservatism is today."
   Mr. Foley's appearance in the well of the House
underscored his direct involvement in the fight. From the
outset, President Bush's demands for a constitutional
amendment have provoked an almost visceral opposition from
the speaker. The son of a judge, Mr. Foley is steeped in
tradition and by nature cautious. While these qualities
contribute to a sometimes frustrating, often passive style,
they served him well in the fight against the amendment.
   Rank-and-file Democrats watched with a certain joy to see
Mr. Foley assert himself openly. Behind the scenes, the
speaker called members personally and was an early advocate
of a strategy to take on the issue squarely on the floor. "It
is a clear victory for the speaker," said Rep. Matthew McHugh
(D., N.Y.). "It validates not only his substantive position
but his strategy in bringing it up early."
   Rep. Foley received a standing ovation from both
Republicans and Democrats after his address.
   The debate, centering on questions about basic American
values, allowed members to quote liberally from sources such
as the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and Voltaire. But contemporary
figures weren't left out, as John Lennon, Andrew Dice Clay
and Norman Rockwell were also among those cited.
   The proposed statute, introduced by Reps. Jim Cooper (D.,
Tenn.) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), called for fines of as much
as $100,000 for desecrating the flag in a manner that was
likely to incite violence and fines of as much as $250,000
for the destruction of publicly owned flags on federal
property. The bill was designed to agree with previous
Supreme Court decisions on free speech. In 1969, the high
court suggested that speech may not be protected if it is
intended to incite imminent violence.
   While failure in the House kills the amendment, the Senate
is likely to go ahead with a vote if only to give members a
chance to go on record on the issue. A constitutional
amendment requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of
congress, plus the approval of the legislatures of
three-fourths of the states.
