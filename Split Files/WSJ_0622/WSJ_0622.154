   National Mercantile Bancorp expects a second-quarter net
loss of about $1 million after a $3.1 million pretax charge.
   In the year-ago quarter, the Los Angeles bank holding
company reported net income of $919,000, or 36 cents a share.

   National Mercantile said the charge reflects severance
costs related to the April resignation of the company's
former president, the write-off of a personal loan to a
former thrift executive, and an increase in the loan-loss
reserve.
   Shareholder equity at the end of the quarter will be $29.8
million, compared with $22.9 million a year earlier. Loans
outstanding rose to $270 million from $198 million.
   William T. Hughes, the new president, said that "the
second half of 1990 will be very profitable" with the
entertainment banking division showing positive returns and
the commercial banking division demonstrating healthy growth.
   For the first half, the company expects a net loss of
$350,000. A year earlier, net was $1.7 million, or 67 cents a
share.
