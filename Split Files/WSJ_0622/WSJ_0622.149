   Nationale-Nederlanden N.V. and Aegon N.V., the
Netherlands' two largest insurers, said they are studying the
possibility of cooperating in health insurance in the Dutch
market.
   Spokesmen for both insurers said they aren't looking at
any broader cooperation and rejected speculation that the
talks could lead to a merger. Analysts said some investors
hope Nationale eventually might bid for its smaller rival,
and suggested that the Dutch insurance business might be ripe
for further consolidation.

   Aegon and Nationale, both of which derive a large share of
their profits outside the Netherlands, are relatively small
players in the Dutch health insurance market. They estimated
their combined premium income at 550 million guilders ($292.4
million) a year, or 10% of the total for private-sector
health insurers. Government entities provide more than
two-thirds of Dutch health insurance. Nationale and Aegon
said cooperation could help them cut costs, especially in
buying automation equipment, and they will study whether
other health insurers want to join.
