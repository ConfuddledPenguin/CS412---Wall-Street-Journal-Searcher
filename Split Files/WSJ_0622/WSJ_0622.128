   Mitek Systems Inc., a San Diego-based computer concern,
said that it expects to report a wider loss for its third
quarter ending June 30, but that profit for the year ending
Sept. 30 should still be "significantly higher" than that a
year earlier.
   In the fiscal 1989 third quarter, Mitek had a net loss of
$423,000, on revenue of $3.3 million. For fiscal 1989, it
earned $403,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $18.1
million.

   Mitek said earnings and revenue in the current quarter
have been hurt by stretch-outs in its government contracts, a
slowdown in spending, and costs related to its acquisition in
March of Tempest Products Organization, a unit of New
York-based Sequa Corp. But Mitek said it is experiencing a
high level of bidding activity that could be reflected in
improved fiscal fourth-quarter performance.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mitek shares were
quoted at $1.625, bid, up 6.25 cents.
