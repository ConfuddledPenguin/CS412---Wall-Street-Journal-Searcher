   WASHINGTON -- Democrats continued to grouse about the Bush
administration's new $51-billion deficit-reduction plan, but
they didn't walk away from budget talks with the White House.
   While uniformly critical of the plan, Democrats appeared
split on how to proceed. Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser (D., Tenn.) complained the new plan "doesn't
give us any foundation on which to build." But his House
counterpart, Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), deemed it "a
starting point" that ought to lead to more give-and-take at
the White House-Congress budget summit. Democrats plan to
huddle on strategy this weekend before rejoining the talks
Monday.

   The administration says its new blueprint would shrink the
projected fiscal 1991 deficit by $50.7 billion. That isn't
nearly enough to avoid across-the-board spending cuts under
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The new proposal
includes $11.7 billion in spending cuts in addition to ones
President Bush proposed in January.
   President Bush told reporters he is ready to allow the
automatic budget cuts required by law to go into effect if an
agreement isn't signed. He also said he expects interest
rates to decline if a budget agreement is signed.
