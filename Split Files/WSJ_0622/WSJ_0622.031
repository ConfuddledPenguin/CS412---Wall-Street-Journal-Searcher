   PITMAN, N.J. -- K-Tron International Inc. is "comfortable"
with analysts' estimates of 1990 per-share earnings in the
area of $1.20, John C. Tucker, vice chairman and chief
financial officer, said.
   That would indicate net income of about $3.5 million. For
1989, the maker of gravimetric feeders, blenders and security
systems reported earnings of $3.2 million, or $1.08 a share,
on revenue of $57.6 million.

   K-Tron expects to post increased sales for the second
quarter, but profit will be "tighter" than a year ago because
of "a shifting mix in our product offering," said Leo Beebe,
chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview. He
didn't make a specific forecast. For the 1989 second quarter,
the company reported earnings of $1.1 million, or 36 cents a
share, on revenue of $14.9 million.
   K-Tron's gravimetric feeders and blenders are devices used
in controlling the rate at which ingredients are fed or mixed
in to make various products. The equipment is sold to
manufacturers of chemicals, plastics and food products.
K-Tron's gravimetric security systems are designed to detect
theft in retail stores by sensing changes in weight of
displayed merchandise.
   The order backlog for feeders and blenders, valued at
about $18 million, is 39% ahead of a year ago, said Mr.
Bebee. He also cited the 15% improvement in the
foreign-exchange rate as an encouraging sign for healthy 1990
earnings.
   In the 1990 first quarter, K-Tron opened a sales, service
and technology-training center in Singapore, hoping to
establish a stronger presence in the Far East and the Pacific
Rim. Near-term, the company expects some "offsets" against
earnings for start-up expenses of the Singapore operation.
"And that isn't cheap," said Mr. Beebe.
   Noting "some softening" in the U.S. market, he said
conditions are stronger in Europe, where demand is running
about 10% better than last year. Indeed, Mr. Beebe said
K-Tron is "having difficulty meeting demand" in Europe.
   During the first quarter, K-Tron reduced its debt about $2
million and continued to have "good positive cash flow," Mr.
Beebe said. As of March 31, long-term debt was $20.5 million.
He said the company plans to continue decreasing its debt.
   Although 1989 results were hurt by the company's
introduction of a new line of gravimetric blenders, Mr. Beebe
said he expects earnings to benefit from K-Tron's new modular
feeder line, introduced in the U.S. about two weeks ago.
   "Ultimately, the new modular feeder will provide K-Tron
with the bulk of its feeders business," said Mr. Beebe. He
expects the modular line to supplant the company's other
feeder lines in the near future.
   The modular equipment is designed so that components can
be shifted or interchanged, permitting quick cleaning and
ingredient conversion. This new flexibility cuts down on
production costs for manufacturers. Beebe said the new design
is a "natural evolution" in feeders.
   "We don't think we have a major competitor with the
modular," Mr. Beebe said. "No one else makes this product."
K-Tron is receiving orders for the modular line from many of
the same multinational customers it has developed in Europe.
   Separately, Mr. Beebe said K-Tron expects to renew its
current RJ Reynolds Tobacco contract to provide
"loss-in-weight" security systems to retailers of cigarettes.
He said the company is also "probing the market" for other
applications of the loss-in-weight technology, testing it
with merchandisers of expensive clothing, cosmetics and
liquor.
