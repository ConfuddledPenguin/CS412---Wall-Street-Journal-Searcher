   DALLAS -- Caspen Oil Inc. named a new chairman and chief
executive in an organizational shuffle that also involved a
stock swap between its parent, Caspen PLC, and Churchill
Technology Inc., based in Lakewood, Colo.
   U.K.-based Caspen PLC exchanged half of its 70% stake in
Caspen Oil for half of Churchill's 30% stake in a fourth oil
exploration company, PRC Technologies Inc. The swap gives
Churchill 5.1 million shares of Caspen Oil, which has 14.9
million shares of common outstanding.

   Anthony J. Carroll, former president of Churchill, was
named chief executive and chairman of Caspen Oil but
continues as chairman of Churchill. He has been replaced as
president by Wendy A. Cribari, the former vice president and
a continuing board member.
   Stepping down as chairman of Caspen Oil was Delo H.
Caspary, 68 years old, who continues as chairman of Caspen
PLC. Mr. Caspary will serve as an advisor to Caspen Oil, said
Mr. Carroll, and intends to pursue offshore expansion
capital.
   Mr. Carroll said he specializes in reorganizing companies
and in four years at Churchill increased shareholder equity
fourfold, to $2.1 million. In its third quarter ended April
30, Caspen Oil reported a loss of $95,458, or 2 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $41,148, or 1 cent a share, in
the same period last year.
