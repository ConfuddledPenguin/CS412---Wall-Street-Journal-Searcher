   REDMOND, Wash. -- Nintendo of America Inc. said it expects
sales of its videogame systems to surpass more than nine
million units this year, 1.5 million more than it previously
forecast. Nintendo said the increase is based on the pace of
sales to date.
   The increase comes despite introduction of new video-game
systems by its industry rivals. The company, a unit of
Nintendo Co. of Japan, estimates it controls about 80% of the
video-game systems market.
