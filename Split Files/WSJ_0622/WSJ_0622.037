   COVENTRY, England -- The Ford man taking the wheel at
Jaguar PLC aims to shift the British luxury-car maker into a
higher gear.
   William Hayden, who becomes Jaguar's chairman July 1,
intends to triple Jaguar's paltry annual output of 50,000
cars, develop several new models, shed archaic labor
practices and modernize its aging assembly plant here in
Britain's industrial heartland. He thinks he can confound
skeptics by achieving the targets without spending as much as
the #1.6 billion ($2.75 billion) Ford Motor Co. paid for
Jaguar last year or diluting Jaguar's exclusive image.

   "It could be a neat trick, couldn't it?" Mr. Hayden asks
playfully. But, turning serious, the tall and ruddy-faced
executive adds that if he didn't believe in the goals, "I
wouldn't be here."
   All this from a Cockney shipyard worker's son who had been
planning his retirement last fall after 40 years at Ford. He
joined the U.S. auto giant as an accounting clerk and spent
the past 16 years as vice president of European
manufacturing. He says he still hopes to retire to his rose
collection when he turns 65 in 1994.
   If anyone can make a success out of Ford's costly foray
into the ultra-luxury car business, it's probably a veteran
car man like Mr. Hayden. Industry executives and financial
analysts cite his role in knitting Ford's diverse factories
into one giant Continental manufacturing machine and his ties
with Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling, a longtime golf buddy.
Mr. Hayden is known "as a tough guy who spoke his own mind,"
says Alan Marsh, an ex-Ford official and now managing
director of Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.K. distributor.
   Mr. Hayden admits he can be abrasive in his bullheaded
determination to get things done. Three years ago, for
instance, his doctor ordered him to shed weight. The auto
executive put himself on a harsh regimen of 500 calories a
day, started 6 a.m. gym workouts and went to bed at nine
o'clock every night to avoid hunger pangs. "My wife said I
did that {diet} like I do everything else: head down and
charging," he recalls.
   He's taking the same no-nonsense approach at Jaguar, where
he ran the Ford transition team before being named Jaguar's
chief executive in March. He succeeds Sir John Egan, who won
a knighthood for rescuing Jaguar in the early 1980s before
seeking a rich partner last year when U.S. car sales soured
and losses piled up again.
   In one of his first acts this spring, Mr. Hayden axed a
badly needed sports car that Jaguar designers had worked on
for nearly six years. The prototype looked beautiful, but
didn't perform well because "it was grossly overweight," he
says. "You can't have a sports car that isn't sporty."
   Canceling a new model two years before its expected launch
"was quite brave," says Christopher Will, an auto analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton in London. He thinks Jaguar also
killed the car because of "the advent in Europe and the U.S.
of very good-quality Japanese sports cars." Mr. Will notes
another five years will elapse before Jaguar produces its
first model under Ford stewardship -- probably a
less-expensive range of so-called executive cars rivaling
BMW.
   Mr. Hayden plans to be equally tough toward poor-quality
suppliers and unionists who resist his push for greater
job-assignment flexibility on the factory floor. Sir John
made some headway with faulty suppliers, but he lacked the
buying clout enjoyed by Ford, Britain's biggest car maker.
While head of Ford's European manufacturing operation, Mr.
Hayden dropped half of its suppliers after they flunked a
numerical quality-control system he devised. Ian Mellor,
another former colleague, remembers that "nobody loved
supplying him" at Ford because he "just wiped out the
inefficient ones."
   Vows Mr. Hayden: The same fate awaits Jaguar suppliers who
"don't match up."
   Grappling with Jaguar's 14 combative and tradition-bound
unions poses a more ticklish task. Many Ford unionists saw
Mr. Hayden as "a very abrasive man" but also "found him
frank, honest and fair," says Andy Richardson, a Transport
and General Workers Union official at Bridgend, Ford's main
U.K. engine plant. Four years ago, Mr. Hayden warned Bridgend
workers that Ford would close the inefficient Welsh factory
in 1990 unless productivity improved. The unions complied.
   Mr. Hayden, in making surprise inspections of Jaguar
facilities late at night and before breakfast, is often
dismayed to find inflexible practices that were phased out
long ago by other British auto makers. An assembly line shuts
down, for instance, once workers meet their daily quota --
rather than when a shift ends. Production also sometimes
grinds to a halt because unions refuse to let non-craft
workers handle an absent craftsman's duties.
   "We're going to have to tackle that," Mr. Hayden says,
while conceding work-rule confrontations could spark a
strike. About 300 Jaguar paint-shop employees walked out this
week, virtually shutting down a 1,800-employee body plant
near Birmingham, because they opposed a management move to
end the night shift. Yesterday, they agreed to return to work
Monday. "We probably have more {wildcat} walkouts here than
we did at Ford," he notes, even though Ford's U.K. unit
employs nearly four times more unionized employees than
Jaguar does.
   But these challenges pale before a much bigger one for the
new Jaguar chairman: how to devise an executive car that can
combat Japanese rivals without watering down the Jaguar
image. A typical British executive car is mass-produced and
smaller than a luxury version. It generally is priced at no
more than #25,000 ($43,000) -- roughly #16,000 less than the
priciest Jaguar -- and appeals to drivers younger than most
Jaguar owners.
   Analysts expect an executive car will absorb most of Mr.
Hayden's plans for tripling output over the next 10 to 15
years. They say the new model also will clash with
less-lavish versions of Toyota's Lexus and Nissan Motor Co.'s
Infiniti. "There is no way to hide {from the Japanese} in the
luxury market except by going up and up," declares Shearson's
Mr. Will. "And what is Ford going to do with Jaguar? It's
going down" in size.
   Mr. Hayden, while declining to discuss any blueprints for
future models, says he isn't worried about the Japanese
threat. "Jaguar isn't a me-too car," he says, sounding more
like his predecessor Sir John than a Ford career man. "You
sit in a Jaguar. It smells like a Jaguar. It feels like a
Jaguar. And that's what you have to hold on to."
   The new Jaguar chairman says he also will preserve
Jaguar's snob appeal by not pushing production beyond 150,000
cars yearly and by limiting Ford's involvement. Fewer than 10
Ford executives will join him at Jaguar. Otherwise, he says,
there would be a lot of people saying, "Let's put the Jaguar
cat on the Fiesta" or "Bulldoze the {Coventry} plant."
   He pauses to look out of his spartan office at a
guardhouse topped with a white jaguar leaping into the air.
Ford's name doesn't appear on any sign at the Coventry
headquarters. Ford paid a lot for a valuable image, he says.
"The last thing we want is to make {Jaguar} a full clone."
