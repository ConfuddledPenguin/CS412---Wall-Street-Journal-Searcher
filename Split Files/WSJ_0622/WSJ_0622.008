   NEW YORK -- Bond prices, reacting to mixed signals on the
economy, seesawed through the day, and stocks followed as
both markets ended with small gains.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.43 points to
2901.73. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose about 3/8
of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount. The
dollar fell against the mark and rose against the yen.

   After opening higher, bond prices headed lower on news
that first-quarter economic growth was stronger than
previously estimated. On the surface, the gain would seem to
be bearish for bonds because there was less chance of a
recession and therefore less likelihood of the Federal
Reserve Board's easing interest rates.
   But later, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said he found the
recent slowing of the economy "puzzling," cheering traders
looking for any nuance suggesting Mr. Greenspan might begin
leaning toward easing interest rates.
   The budget-deficit report for May also helped bonds turn
higher. Some investors, expecting the deficit to be wider
than most estimates, sold bonds in advance of the news. But
when the deficit turned out to be close to expectations,
those investors bought back bonds to even up positions.
   Stocks tagged along, with the added influence at the end
of the session of futures-related buy programs and some
institutional buying related to end-of-the-quarter efforts to
dress up portfolios.
   In currency trading, the dollar firmed against the yen on
news suggesting the Japanese economy is overheating, said
Linda McLaughlin, currency trader at Chemical Bank.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on Big Board volume of 138.6 million
shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.49%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6778 marks and 154.80 yen, compared
with 1.6785 marks and 153.93 yen Wednesday.
