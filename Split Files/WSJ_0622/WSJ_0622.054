   DAYTON, Ohio -- Duriron Co., a maker of pumps, valves and
filtration systems, said second-quarter earnings probably
won't meet year-earlier record profit of $5.1 million, or 43
cents a share, citing product development programs and
manufacturing upgrades. But it said net income should equal
about 39 cents a share, the average of the past five
quarters.
   For the full year, Duriron said it still expects to exceed
its 1989 record earnings of $19.7 million, or $1.58 a share.
Sales last year were $281 million. The company said incoming
business remains strong, as a result of capital spending by
customers involved in chemical processing.
