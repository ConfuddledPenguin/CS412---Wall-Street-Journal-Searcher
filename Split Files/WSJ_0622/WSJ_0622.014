   ACCEL INTERNATIONAL Corp., Dublin, Ohio, said its board
declared a quarterly dividend of five cents a common share
and set a policy of paying at least 20 cents annually,
payable on a quarterly basis. In addition, R. Max Williamson,
president and chief executive officer of the specialty
insurance concern, was named to the additional post of
chairman. He succeeds Brian L. Howell, who retires as
chairman and chief financial officer on July 31. The
dividend, the first paid since a special cash dividend in
1983, is payable Aug. 1 to shares of record July 9. Accel
said its board believed the dividend was warranted because of
the company's consistent earnings growth over the past
several years.
