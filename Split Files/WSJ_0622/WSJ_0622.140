   Ames Department Stores Inc., Rocky Hill, Conn., said a
U.S. bankruptcy court judge approved 219 of 221 store
closings Ames had proposed.
   The troubled retailer, operating under a Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization, also received clearance to resume
construction on a distribution center in Leesport, Pa., and
to make vacation payments to former employees who left the
company before April 25, the date of the bankruptcy filing.
The case is being heard by Judge Howard C. Buschman III in
federal bankruptcy court in New York.

   Judge Buschman reserved judgment on the closing of two
Ames stores in Cincinnati and Bloomsburg, Pa., pending
further testimony from affected employees and Ames management
at a hearing July 11.
   The 219 stores will be shut in August and September after
inventories and clearance sales, an Ames spokesman said. The
company has said it needs to close the stores and let go
their 18,000 employees to stem losses and regain
profitability.
   "While we recognize the impact this will have, we had to
take this action to preserve the jobs of the majority of the
Ames employees," said Stephen L. Pistner, Ames chief
executive officer.
