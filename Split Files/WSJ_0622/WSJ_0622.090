   SAN FRANCISCO -- Genentech Inc.'s designer antibody for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome so far appears to be
nontoxic to patients, but it has yet to show signs of
effectiveness against the disease.
   That is the view of Lawrence Corey of the University of
Washington, Seattle, who presented unpublished data on the
antibody, the compound CD4-IGG, to an audience of several
thousand here at the Sixth Internatonal Conference on AIDS.
Progress reports on other drugs also were mixed.

   CD4-IGG links a synthetic version of the virus's target to
an all-purpose antibody, to lure the virus to bind to the
decoy molecule instead of human cells. By fusing it to the
antibody, scientists hoped to rally active immunity against
the virus particles.
   However, the new drug has yet to produce any consistent
improvement in patients' immune cells or in their virus
levels, Dr. Corey said.
   Researchers plan to escalate the dose levels of the
compound. But for now, Dr. Corey said the experience
illustrates that "even the best {test-tube} ideas won't come
to easy fruition" in treating AIDS patients.
   In a study conducted at Brown University, the Bristol
Myers-Squibb Co. drug D4T, effectively reduced the levels of
a viral protein, p24. However, it also caused toxic
reactions.
   The most severe side effect was neuropathy, or tingling
and painful sensations. Patients also experienced some
drug-induced hepatitis, anemia and nausea while taking the
drug, said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a researcher at the National
Cancer Institute, who summarized the study.
   Dr. Yarchoan also reported results of a study on a drug
called azidouridine (AzdU) by researchers at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
   Some patients on AzdU enjoyed a boost in their
infection-fighting T4 cells, and a drop in levels of virus.
But no such improvements occured in patients who had
previously taken the drug AZT. This suggests that resistent
viruses that arose during AZT therapy may have lost their
ability to respond to the newer drug.
   AzdU is made by the Triton Biosciences Inc. subsidiary of
Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
