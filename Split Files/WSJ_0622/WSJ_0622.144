   Ashland Oil Inc., bouyed by substantially higher refinery
margins, said it expects fiscal third-quarter profit to
"exceed by a comfortable margin" 1986 third-quarter record
profit of $82 million, or $1.21 a share.
   In the 1989 third quarter, ended June 30, the Ashland,
Ky., refiner had net income of $44 million, or 78 cents a
share, on sales of $2.09 billion.

   Ashland said it expects to report that operating income at
its Ashland Petroleum Co. unit would exceed the 1986
third-quarter record of $110 million. In the same quarter a
year earlier, Ashland Petroleum, the company's refining and
marketing division, had operating income of $53 million.
   The company declined to reveal its refinery margins-the
margins between prices on crude oil and refined products. In
the same quarter a year earlier, Ashland reported that its
refinery margins were between $3.25 and $3.50, down from
between $5 and $6 in the 1988 third quarter.
