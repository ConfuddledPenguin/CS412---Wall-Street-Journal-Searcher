   Advocates of shareholder rights have decried last week's
decision by a federal appeals court to strike down the
Securities and Exchange Commission's "one-share, one-vote"
rule as another victory for management at the expense of
shareholders. The truth is that while they may have lost a
battle, they have gained a tactical advantage.
   The SEC's Rule 19c4, which was adopted in 1988, prohibited
public firms from issuing multiple classes of stock with
unequal voting rights. There was a "grandfather" provision
that allowed companies with two classes of stock already in
place to keep them. At the time, 60 companies listed on the
New York Stock Exchange had multiple voting rights or planned
to introduce them, as did 182 companies on the National
Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation system
and 117 companies on the American Stock Exchange.

   The SEC has long feuded with state securities regulators
and courts for control of the nation's securities laws. Its
strongest foe is Delaware, whose courts and legislature
dominate merger and takeover laws. Delaware is king of
corporate law because its stable, pro-management laws have
drawn most large public firms to incorporate there. Delaware
allows poison pills without shareholder consent, its
anti-takeover law makes obsolete many provisions of the SEC's
tender-offer regulations, and it allows dual-voting stock (as
do almost all state incorporation laws). The SEC vigorously
opposes all of these on the grounds that they are
unacceptable barriers to competition for control of public
corporations.
   The federal appeals court's stinging rebuke last week is
strike three for the SEC in this area of national merger
policy. Strike one was the 1985 International Household
decision allowing poison pills without a shareholder vote,
and strike two was the 1987 Supreme Court decision upholding
the new wave of state anti-takeover laws. The appeals court's
decision last week was a sharp reminder to the SEC that it is
the states that retain most of the authority and
responsibility for regulating the voting and merger rules of
public firms. Delaware remains king.
   The big question now is: Where does the SEC go to protect
its decaying franchise in setting national policy in
corporate control?
   According to my informal survey of academics, most expect
the SEC to appeal the decision -- and to lose the appeal. If
that happens, the the SEC could then ask Congress to enact
legislation providing explicit authority to federalize this
portion of the law of corporations. Although members of
Congress might be willing in principle to support a
one-share, one-vote law, they probably wouldn't have the
stomach for the politically bruising battle that would
entail. A more pragmatic response would be for the SEC to
find an indirect regulatory solution that achieves the same
result of prohibiting dual-voting stock without having a
formal rule like 19c4. Any such indirect action, however, is
likely to elicit a determined legal challenge from the
Business Roundtable (a group of 200 major corporations) --
the same folks who took on Rule 19c4 and won.
   What if the SEC does nothing? I know it sounds
far-fetched, in view of the regulatory zeal of Chairman
Richard Breeden. But, what if? After all, Mr. Breeden is said
to be a smart politician, and it might be smartest for the
SEC to concede the top slot in merger policy to Delaware. The
SEC could then concentrate on rooting out insider trading,
coordinating the regulation of international financial
markets, and cracking down on penny-stock promoters, program
traders, and rival domestic regulatory agencies. Let's face
it, the market for corporate control has already produced
more than its share of public embarrassments for the SEC --
on state anti-takeover laws, poison pills, and now one-share,
one-vote rules.
   Is it politically feasible for the SEC to walk away from
the one-share, one-vote controversy? Rule 19c4 had many
powerful supporters, who are now urging the SEC to appeal the
court ruling and to seek new legislation if it loses the
appeal. Institutional investors and shareholder activists
have staunchly opposed dual-voting and are extremely worried
that many public firms will now rush to create multiple
classes of stock, further entrenching managers and eroding
shareholder rights.
   This concern is largely misplaced.
   True, dual-voting stock is among the most effective
anti-takeover devices available to public firms. Also true,
several dozen firms adopted dual-voting stock during the
gestation period preceding Rule 19c4. But in the past two
years the demand for dual-voting stock (and other takeover
barriers) has been reduced by several changes -- the demise
of Drexel Burnham, the neutralization of Michael Milken, the
reduced availability of takeover financing, and the
legalization of substitute takeover barriers, such as poison
pills and state anti-takeover laws.
   In the case of dual-voting stock, however, the crucial
point is that any such recapitalizations must be approved by
a majority vote of shareholders. And in the past two years,
institutional shareholders have become much more powerful and
effective opponents.
   The best way for shareholder activists and the SEC to
pursue their mutual interests is to concentrate their
political efforts on achieving meaningful reform of the proxy
system. If the SEC can be persuaded to overhaul the proxy
system, then institutional shareholders will be able to
defeat via proxy fights most efforts to establish dual-voting
stock. Moreover, proxy reform would bring such great
across-the-board leverage to institutional investors and
shareholder-rights proponents that it would make no practical
sense for them to invest any more valuable political capital
fighting for a universal one-share, one-vote rule. Put all
your resources behind proxy reform and go for the Big Score,
I say.
   What precisely does "proxy reform" mean? Two thoughtful
proposals have been submitted recently to the SEC. The United
Shareholders Association (a Washington-based
shareholder-rights group founded by T. Boone Pickens Jr.)
seeks a confidential proxy voting requirement, improved
shareholder access to the proxy, shareholder approval of
poison pills, golden parachutes, and greenmail payments, and
liberalization of the SEC's proxy solicitation rules to
facilitate communications among shareholders. The California
Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest
pension fund for civil servants, has submitted to the SEC
similar proposals for proxy reform.
   As state anti-takeover laws, poison pills, and now
dual-voting proposals all threaten to entrench corporate
managements, shareholders must depend more directly on the
proxy machinery to make managers accountable. This makes
proxy reform to remove the clear biases against dissident
shareholders even more urgent. Surely, shareholder activists
can make the SEC and Congress see the merit of this argument.
   Even if the SEC decides to retreat from the battle for
corporate control, the shareholder advocates still ought to
benefit from the coming proxy battles over dual-voting
initiatives. Unlike Carl Icahn's controversial spin-off
proposal, or most poison-pill challenges, dual-voting
proposals will almost certainly be met with across-the-board
opposition by all kinds of institutional investors. It
shouldn't be hard for them to fight down such proposals
successfully. A few victories would provide the unity and
confidence necessary to bring success in the other, more
difficult proxy challenges.
   If the SEC's defeat in court on dual voting can bolster
the prospects for meaningful proxy reform, then
shareholder-rights advocates should come away clear winners.
Advocates of shareholder rights will decry last week's court
decision, as they should. If they play their cards right,
however, they will win the much bigger prize of proxy reform.
