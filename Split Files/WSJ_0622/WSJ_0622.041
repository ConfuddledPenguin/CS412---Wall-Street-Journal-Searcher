   When American and Japanese trade negotiators knock heads
yet again starting Monday, the most contentious issue will be
whether Japan promises to build enough parks, sewers, and
roads for its long-suffering citizens over the next decade.
   It may seem like a curious battle because the two nations
usually scrap over tangible import barriers, such as the
Japanese government's refusal to buy U.S. supercomputers or
to allow large U.S. retail stores to open in Japan.

   But in this case, the U.S. is resorting to macroeconomic
manipulation to try and whittle down its intractable $49
billion trade deficit with Japan. U.S. government economists
argue that Japan runs trade surpluses because it doesn't
invest enough, and they want Japan to boost public investment
to soak up more of its savings.
   Japan, for its part, is resisting, arguing that too much
pork barrel will overheat its already strong full-employment
economy, pushing up inflation and interest rates. And the
Japanese resent the U.S. demanding such specific policy
promises.
   "Can the U.S. make the same demands of West Germany?" asks
Yutaka Kosai, president of the Japan Center for Economic
Research. "Maybe Japan should demand that America . . . keep
its Gramm-Rudman-Hollings {deficit-reduction} targets."
   There will indeed be "a matching of strategies," insists
John Taylor of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers
and one of the principals of the U.S. negotiating team. He
says that as the Japanese reduce their imbalance, by boosting
investment to soak up more savings domestically, the U.S.
will reduce its imbalance, by cutting spending and increasing
its savings.
   In addition to public spending, the two governments will
haggle over a range of issues in Tokyo as they try to draft a
final report on the yearlong experiment, known as the
Structural Impediments Initiative, in reducing the bilateral
trade imbalance. They will try to agree on ways for Japan to
toughen its antitrust policy, and to become more
import-friendly. Japanese officials resolve to finish the
talks next week, and this week they handed over proposed
drafts to the U.S. for the final report, which one senior
U.S. official characterized as "some progress but not a lot."
   After two weeks of trading insults over the public
spending issue, each side appears to be backing off a bit.
The main sticking point has been the U.S. demand that Japan
promise to devote 10% of its gross national product on public
spending by 1995, up from 7%. On Tuesday, S. Linn Williams, a
deputy U.S. trade representative said "we are not necessarily
sticking to the GNP figure. We still find the GNP figure
attractive from our standpoint. At the same time, we
understand the Japanese government's point that it is
difficult to budget as a percentage of GNP."
   Japanese officials, meanwhile, are floating increasingly
higher levels of spending targets. Originally, the Japanese
government said it would devote 400 trillion yen ($2.6
trillion) to public works over the next 10 years, while the
U.S. was asking for about 500 trillion. Now the Japanese, in
proposals handed over this week, have raised that level to
415 trillion yen.
   While fighting over the specifics, Japanese officials
themselves admit they should spend more on their
infrastructure. According to the government's own studies,
the level of sewers, public parks, and roads is currently
below the 1965 average of the U.S., West Germany, England and
France, and far below current standards.
   For example, only 40% of the Japanese homes are attached
to sewage systems and the goal is to reach 70% by 2000. That
would still leave Japan behind current rates in England,
Germany, and the U.S.
   "What the U.S. is now saying is what we have been saying
for the past 10 years," says Makoto Taketoshi, a planning
director for the Ministry of Construction. In mid-May, his
office submitted a 300-trillion yen wish list for the 1990s.
One goal is to double the length of highways by the early
21st century.
   Japan lags Western countries because it has a relatively
recent history of urban development, and because, for many
years, "the emphasis was on improving production capacity
rather than social infrastructure," says Yukio Noguchi, a
public finance expert at Hitotsubashi University. Japan,
however, is rapidly catching up, and its current level of
public spending far exceeds that of the other industrialized
nations.
   But Japan's infrastructure improvement campaign has
dropped drastically since the late 1970s, when public debt
ballooned out of control as a result of a new social welfare
system and an oil-shock-induced drop in tax revenues. The
Finance Ministry went on a ruthless campaign to eliminate the
debt, and virtually all government spending was frozen in the
1980s.
   This isn't the first time Japan has been pushed to adjust
its domestic macroeconomic policies. In the late 1970s,
President Carter urged both Japan and West Germany to act as
"locomotives" pulling international growth. In 1985, Japan
agreed to pump up the value of the yen vs. the dollar, making
Japanese goods relatively more expensive. Shortly after,
Japan agreed to reorient its economy, depending on domestic
demand, rather than exports, for growth.
   While Japan's overall surplus has in fact dropped as a
result of these changes, the lingering U.S.-Japan imbalance
shows the limits of such economic tinkering. Many Japanese
officials argue that other factors, such as exchange rates,
interest rates, and other forms of investments and savings
could move to keep the imbalance at the current level.
