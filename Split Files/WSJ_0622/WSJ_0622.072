   Jacobs Suchard AG, a giant Swiss chocolate and coffee
company, suspended trading in its stock amid reports that
Philip Morris Cos. plans to acquire all or part of Suchard.
   Zurich-based Suchard plans an announcement after a
scheduled board meeting today, which comes on the heels of a
report in the Swiss newspaper Cash that Suchard Chairman
Klaus Jacobs plans to sell his 60% voting stake to Philip
Morris.

   The report, which said Philip Morris would also make a bid
for the remaining Suchard shares, sparked a 2.3% rise in
Suchard shares in hectic trading on Zurich's stock exchange.
   Acquiring Suchard would cost roughly $4.5 billion,
analysts say.
   Neither Suchard nor New York-based Philip Morris would
comment on the report. But many analysts and investment
bankers said they believed it to be accurate.
   Such a move would advance Philip Morris's strategy of
continuing to reduce its reliance on tobacco by expanding its
international food business following two giant U.S. food
acquisitions. Philip Morris bought General Foods Corp. in
1985 for $5.7 billion and bought Kraft Inc. for $13 billion
at the end of 1988.
   Though Philip Morris was cited as the most likely bidder,
Mars Inc. of McLean, Va., also was mentioned as a possible
buyer. Other speculation is that Suchard will announce a
partial sale of its chocolate interests, or announce a merger
with Cadbury Schweppes PLC of the U.K. Another rumor has it
that Suchard will sell E.J. Brach, the Chicago-based candy
manufacturer which was acquired in 1987. Brach caused the
company an operating loss in the U.S. of $50 million in 1989.
   The Suchard suspension strengthened the shares of other
European food-products companies. Cadbury Schweppes rose
sharply in a flat U.K. market, closing up 17 pence at 364
pence ($6.27). Rumors about a combination between Cadbury and
Suchard have swirled around the companies for more than a
year.
   Cadbury spokesman Chris Milburn declined to comment, but
said the British consumer-goods company continues "to look at
opportunities for building both our confectionery and
soft-drink businesses."
   In its report, Cash suggested that Suchard's Mr. Jacobs
had incurred 700 million Swiss francs ($495.7 million) in
debt through the buy-out last year of other family members
who held a stake in his private holding company Colima,
making him subject to rising interest rates. Mr. Jacobs has
not been available for comment.
   However, analysts say it has been known for some time that
Mr. Jacobs wished to withdraw from the running of the Jacobs
Suchard group, which had sales of 6.7 billion Swiss francs
and a net income of 275 million Swiss francs in 1989. It
employs over 16,000 people world-wide.
   "A takeover isn't so surprising if you recall that Mr.
Jacobs had not wished to stay around forever," said Swiss
Volksbank analyst Urs Brunner.
