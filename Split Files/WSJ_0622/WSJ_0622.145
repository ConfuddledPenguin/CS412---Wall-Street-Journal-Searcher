   Israel's struggling Koor Industries, the country's biggest
conglomerate, said it had a record loss of 595 million
shekels ($291 million) last year.
   Koor's annual report also said the holding company had
agreed "in principle" to restructure domestic and foreign
debts.

   "The finalization of a comprehensive financial arrangement
would enable Koor to derive the full benefit of its operating
progress over the past two years," the report said. Koor said
nearly half of the 1989 loss was sustained by Tadiran, its
consumer and defense electronics subsidiary. Tadiran and
another subsidiary, Soltam, which makes artillery and other
weapons, were hurt by cutbacks in Defense Ministry purchases.
   The 1989 loss compared with red ink of 430 million shekels
in 1988.
   Koor, which is owned by Israel's Histadrut labor
federation, employs more than 23,500 workers. Sales in 1989
totaled 4.6 billion shekels.
