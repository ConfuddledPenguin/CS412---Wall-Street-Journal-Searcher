   NEW YORK -- Coniston Partners, one of the best known
corporate raiders of the 1980s, will soon be no more.
   Keith R. Gollust, Paul E. Tierney Jr., and Augustus K.
Oliver, three Ivy leaguers who once terrorized huge
corporations from Allegis Corp. to Gillette Inc., are
disbanding their main $700 million investment pool and
returning the money to their investors.

   The Coniston executives said they are making the move to
reflect the new environment of the 1990s, in which companies
can't easily obtain debt financing for the type of highly
leveraged transactions Coniston often advocated. Also, they
said, the stock market's recent record gains have made
undervalued companies more difficult to find.
   Although the partners were loath to say so, their decision
is the latest sign of the end of the 1980s acquisition era.
"The very favorable environment that encouraged this type of
activity has changed," said partner Keith R. Gollust, adding:
"The business that we used to be in, we don't plan to be in
anymore."
   Coniston began informing its investors yesterday that
while it plans to maintain its two existing investments in TW
Services Inc. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp., it
intends to return the rest of its cash to investors early
next month.
   Instead of using the Coniston pool to bankroll its raids,
the partnership of Gollust, Tierney and Oliver will raise
financing as needed on a deal-by-deal basis. Although they
may seek some acquistions, they plan to branch out, using
their own funds, into venture capital, real estate, and
restructuring of troubled companies.
   Formed in February 1982, Coniston typically would buy 10%
to 20% of the stock of a target company, then use that block
of stock as a club to press for drastic action -- a breakup,
asset sale, or even a takeover that would enable Coniston to
sell out at a profit.
   In its investment style, Coniston often acted like
corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn or Irwin Jacobs. Yet the
partnership was formed by three Wall Streeters who previously
provided legal and investment banking advice to corporations.
Mr. Gollust and Mr. Oliver have undergraduate degrees from
Princeton and Yale, respectively, and Mr. Tierney has a
business degree from Harvard.
   The Coniston partnership generated returns of more than
40% annually to its investors before subtracting the
partners' 20% share of profits. Yet in the wake of the
collapse of the junk-bond market last year and banks' current
reluctance to make loans for highly leveraged transactions,
it was confronted with the fact that its past strategy
wouldn't work as well.
   "Any form of restructuring or sale of the business
generally involves creating highly leveraged companies," said
Mr. Gollust, adding: "Obviously, financing for highly
leveraged companies is harder to obtain."
   One example of that difficulty is Coniston's $400 million
investment in an 11.8% stake in the stock of UAL, where
Coniston is supporting an uphill union effort to obtain
financing for a $4.38 billion leveraged buy-out. At UAL's
current stock price of $156.50 a share, Coniston has a slight
loss on an investment made last October in the wake of the
failure of the unions' first buy-out attempt.
   By comparison, an earlier 1987 investment in Allegis,
which forced the sale of the company's hotel and rental-car
units, resulted in a $175 million profit.
   Last year, for the first time since at least 1985,
Coniston's investment returns lagged the stock market by a
wide margin. One its main funds returned 14%, compared with
31.7% for the Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. 500 stock index.
   The partners said they recognize that time horizons to
achieve their goals in each investment will have to be
longer. Coniston has already become a long-term investor in
TW Services. "Coniston in particular really wasn't well
suited to the investment horizon we think is going to be
necessary in the 1990s," said Mr. Oliver.
   "By not having that fund under management, we don't have
the pressure of having to engage in that sort of investment
activity," Mr. Oliver added. He said the three executives
plan to engage in a broader range of activity with their own
capital, seeking outside funds only as needed.
   Coniston also plans to reorganize its $200 million fund
for risk arbitrage, which invests in takeover stocks and in
securities of troubled companies, such as junk bonds trading
at a big discount from their issue price. That fund will be
reconstituted as two funds to reflect those two goals.
   Mr. Oliver said the changes won't result in any job losses
among Coniston's 15 employees. Nor, he said, will the three
partners necessarily reduce the amount of time they spend on
business.
   "This is just a recognition of the fact that times have
changed, and we want to change with them."
