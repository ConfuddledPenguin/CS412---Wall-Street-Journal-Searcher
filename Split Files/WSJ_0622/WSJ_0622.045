   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about
1.6 million 1984-90 model Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds to fix defective seat belt buckles linked to at
least one injury.
   The company said plastic push buttons that operate the
buckle latches in the cars could be weakened by prolonged
exposure to sunlight and heat and could break, causing the
buckles to fail.

   Two other GM cars have the same buckles, the subcompact
Pontiac LeMans and the ultra-luxury Cadillac Allante, a GM
spokesman said. But the company hasn't heard of any problems
with the buckles on those models, he added.
   GM said that because it doesn't have enough replacement
parts on hand to fix all the cars immediately, it is asking
Camaro and Firebird owners not to head for dealerships unless
their belt buckles appear broken. Owners who decide not to
get the problem fixed immediately will get a second letter
this fall to schedule replacement of buckles "as replacement
parts become available," the auto maker said.
   This is the largest recall GM has announced since July
1989, when it recalled 1.7 million full-size and luxury cars
to fix defective cruise control systems suspected of causing
throttles to stick open.
   GM said Camaro and Firebird owners will know they have a
problem if the red plastic push buttons on the safety belt
latches fail to hold the belt buckle in place, or won't
release properly.
   GM officials learned about the problem from reports
gathered by its field representatives, the spokesman said.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was also
investigating the problem. GM decided to conduct the recall
voluntarily, however, the spokesman said. GM didn't say how
many incidents it had discovered of the buckles failing,
other than the one that resulted in an injury to a passenger.
   GM said it will eventually replace all of the buckles in
the affected models at no charge to owners.
