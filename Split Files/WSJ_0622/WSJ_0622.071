   FLEMING Cos. (Oklahoma City) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it assigned a Prime-2 rating to the commercial
paper programs of this food wholesale distributor, affecting
$400 million in a program administered by Merrill Lynch Money
Markets Inc. and $200 million in a program administered by
First Boston Corp. The rating concern also affirmed the Baa-2
rating on the company's unsecured senior securities, citing
its leadership position in the industry, its adequate
debt-service measurements and the expectation that its
improving operating performance over the past few quarters
will continue through the next year.
