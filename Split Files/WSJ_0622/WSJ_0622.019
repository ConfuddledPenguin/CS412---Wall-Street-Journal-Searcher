<TEXT>
   I am not a believer in the idea of a "post-industrial"
society. For me the very essence of business, in fact the
very foundation of a nation's economy is manufacturing. Why?
Because manufacturing creates. It takes resources and
materials, and by applying knowledge to them creates
products.
