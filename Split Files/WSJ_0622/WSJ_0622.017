   PARIS -- Bouygues SA, Europe's largest construction and
public works group, has made a conscious decision to favor
its medium-term growth over short-term earnings
considerations.
   Profit growth at Bouygues, one of the favorite blue-chip
stocks on the Paris bourse in recent years, is likely to
continue underperforming the rest of the industry sector this
year and next, Parisian equity analysts believe.

   But that doesn't mean that the group is running out of
steam.
   On the contrary, Bouygues is building up its financial
muscle thanks to a policy of diversification and real-estate
investment that will come to fruition in the next two or
three years, according to observers both within and outside
the group.
   Martin Bouygues, who has headed the construction group for
almost a year since taking over from his father, acknowledged
in an interview that investing in the future weighed on
Bouygues's financial performance last year.
   Consolidated net profit rose by 10%, to 573 million francs
($101.6 million) in 1989, from 519 million francs in 1988.
Consolidated revenue grew by 16%, to 47 billion francs, from
40.7 billion. Bouygues expects its revenue growth will slow
to 14% this year, reaching 53.5 billion francs.
   Bouygues's strategy of deliberately damping earnings
growth to invest in the future contrasts with strategies in
the U.S., where quarterly earnings reports may influence
decision-making.
   But Bouygues and its allies control 54.2% of the parent
company's voting rights, putting the group in a position to
carry on without worry about hostile takeovers or negative
shareholder reactions.
   "We're not looking for short-term shareholders interested
in a quick capital gain. What we want are stable, faithful
shareholders," commented Olivier Poupart-Lafarge, the group's
financial director.
   "From a shareholder's point of view, this is fine if you
have a clear idea of where future earnings will be coming
from, and that they will show up in the bottom line,"
comments Nigel Phipps, construction analyst with brokerage
Sellier SA. "If nothing shows up in the next two or three
years, Bouygues's core shareholders may become impatient," he
adds.
   Bouygues invested 4.6 billion francs last year, of which
2.8 billion francs went into sectors as varied as food,
banking and telecommunications.
   "Bouygues is doing exactly what it should be doing" by
branching into sectors such as communications, where profit
margins are higher and markets are less cyclical, comments
Pierre Bosset, construction sector analyst with Parisian
brokerage house DLP James Capel SA.
   In a move that raised some eyebrows, the group spent 1.2
billion francs last year to acquire a controlling interest in
Grands Moulins de Paris. But surprise turned to admiration
when it emerged that Grands Moulins, which controls 20% of
the French flour milling market, also owns prime land
bordering the River Seine.
   The group intends to focus its expansion efforts on Europe
this year. Mr. Bouygues says he is looking for partners in
Germany and the U.K. -- countries in which the group
currently has a low profile.
   Bouygues says the group's acquisition of a 3.5% stake
(raised to 4.5% earlier this year) in Banco Central, Spain's
second-biggest financial institution, is already starting to
bear fruit.
   Mr. Bouygues concedes that North America hasn't been a
priority area for growth, although the group's road-building
subsidiaries are active in the U.S.
   Despite his Gallic caution about Eastern Europe, Mr.
Bouygues is deeply involved in two joint projects in the
Soviet Union to build an eye clinic in Moscow and a hotel
complex in Uzbekistan.
   The French group is also active in Hong Kong, where it
built two high-rise office blocks and won a contract for
another two.
   Marring the overall picture is Bouygues Offshore, a
diversification into the oil services and construction
business that was hit by the downturn in the international
oil market.
   Martin Bouygues has frequently hinted that future
diversification will be in the communications business.
