   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc.'s multibillion-dollar debt
refinancing plan won some praise from Moody's Investors
Service Inc., which downgraded the food and tobacco company's
bonds in January.
   The refinancing plan's "impact on leverage and {interest}
coverage ratios appears positive," the rating concern said.
It didn't say whether it is considering changing its single-B
ratings on most of RJR's high-yield, below-investment-grade
"junk" bonds. When Moody's lowered some RJR ratings, prices
of RJR and other junk bonds plunged as much as 10% in a week.

   RJR and its main shareholder, the New York leveraged
buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., are developing a
plan to retire more than $4 billion of junk bonds, interest
rates for which must be reset by next April. Terms of the
reset agreement could require RJR to pay substantially higher
interest rates on these bonds, which would add to its debt
burden and weaken its financial health.
   Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its ratings
of double-B on RJR's senior debt and single-B-plus on
subordinated debt. It said these ratings had already
reflected S&amp;P's belief that RJR would successfully address
the reset requirement.
   If RJR does refinance its debt, said S&amp;P, "The increased
near-term requirement for cash interest and preferred
dividends would largely offset the longer-term benefits of a
reduced but still quite sizable total debt and interest
burden."
   Nonetheless, S&amp;P said: "The potential for an upgrade over
the next few years remains. An upgrade would be predicated
upon continued strong operating performance and cash-flow
generation growth. This would likely require RJR's domestic
cigarette market share to stabilize, ongoing industry volume
declines to remain near current levels, and an anticipated
near-term excise tax increase on tobacco to be of moderate
size or be deferred."
   Meanwhile, several bankers reported progress in raising a
$2.25 billion bank loan to help RJR refinance its junk-bond
debt. The loan is being led by units of Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Bankers Trust New
York Corp., each of which is expected to contribute $350
million. Bank commitments for the full amount should be
gathered in a week or two, an officer at one of the four lead
banks said. "We're in pretty good shape," he said.
   Two Japanese banks said they are interested in joining the
loan, though other Japanese banks have pulled back
substantially from their previously brisk role in lending to
highly leveraged companies.
