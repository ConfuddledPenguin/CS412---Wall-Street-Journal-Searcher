   WASHINGTON -- The last door at Tammany Hall just slammed
shut.
   The Supreme Court dashed more than 200 years of American
political tradition in just 16 pages, ruling that party
affiliation can no longer be used to determine who is hired
or promoted for most government jobs. The high court ordered
the virtual elimination of the practice of patronage -- the
spoils system where public jobs were parceled out to the
party faithful by victorious politicians.

   "No longer are people going to have to show party
registration cards for jobs," says Gary LaPaille, Democratic
Party chairman of Illinois, the state whose system prompted
the ruling.
   So job applicants who hoped their vote in the last
election might get them their next job on a road crew or as a
prison guard, or who hoped their party loyalty might win them
a promotion from rehabilitation counselor to supervisor, are
going to be disappointed.
   In short, the court voted 5-4 to repeal the Law of
Tammany's George Washington Plunkitt:
   "First, this great and glorious country was built up by
political parties; second, parties can't hold together if
their workers don't get offices when they win; third, if the
parties go to pieces, the government they built up must go to
pieces, too; fourth, then there'll be hell to pay."
   Justice Antonin Scalia cited Plunkitt, the patron saint of
patronage, in his dissent. But Justice William Brennan, in
the majority opinion, had a succinct answer: "To the victor
belong only those spoils that may be constitutionally
obtained."
   The court said the First Amendment rights of government
workers are violated if they are denied promotions, transfers
or recalls from layoffs because of their party affiliation.
The court said turning away applicants because of their party
affiliation also violates the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of speech.
   That means that job-seekers who want to work in a state
garage in Springfield, Ill., will have shorter job
applications to complete. They no longer have to say whether
they voted in the Republican primary, whether they
contributed to the party and whether they have the support of
local political potentates.
   From here on in, promotions in government no longer depend
on promoting a political party.
   The decision will have a major impact in Illinois, where
Republican Gov. James Thompson has held a tight grip for a
decade on state employment practices for public jobs at every
level.
   It is also likely to have a significant effect on numerous
other states in which patronage has been widely practiced,
including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. (The
ruling won't have a significant effect on the federal
government, which does its hiring through the civil service
system rather than by patronage.)
   The ruling also will force county and city officials to
change their ways. It means, for example, that government
facilities like Westchester County's Playland Rye Amusement
Park may no longer be staffed primarily by Republicans with
political clout. The park was cited last week by New York's
Commission on Government Integrity, which found a "blurred
line" between the GOP and the Westchester County government.
   "Partisan politics is a factor if not the dominant factor
in hiring in some situations both in Westchester and in New
York City," says Timothy Brosnan, counsel to the chairman of
the commission. "That is bad. It has an impact on the civil
service work force -- it is morale-damaging -- and we think
partisan political considerations should be removed from the
process."
   In New York City, for example, "no-skills-required" jobs
and highway-repair jobs are routinely handed out on the basis
of political considerations.
   The court's ruling eliminates the last vestiges of a
political employment system that was rich in color but often
steeped in corruption.
   As recently as a dozen years ago, Indiana public employees
were pressured to contribute to political parties directly
from their paychecks. The system, which Indiana Democratic
Chairman Michael Pannos says was "not really voluntary,"
operated much the way payroll deductions were made for union
dues or U.S. Savings Bond contributions in the private
sector. Moreover, license plates, title transfers and
drivers' licenses were until 1987 controlled by party bosses
who made a profit on their operations. The jobs, however, are
still filled by appointees chosen with heavy input from the
state political organizations.
   "There are still a lot of jobs that are being passed out
to party faithful," says John Hammond, who was senior
executive assistant to former GOP Gov. Robert Orr in Indiana.
"But current practices are probably going to have to be
changed."
   The changes were welcomed tentatively by party leaders who
recognized that the sunset of traditional patronage was
inevitable and probably not so terrible.
   "The parties have got to begin to move away from patronage
as the vehicle from which they derive their volunteers and
their activists," says Thomas Druce, executive director of
the Pennsylvania Republican party. "There was the idea around
that you could build a party through patronage, but it hasn't
worked in years anyway. We've got to build our political
apparatus around ideas, not jobs."
   The full impact of the ruling still is unclear. "It's
question time in Ohio," says Brian Berry, executive director
of the state's Republican Party. "We don't know whether, if
we win the gubernatorial election, we'll be stuck with all
the people the Democrats gave jobs to."
   The court ruling doesn't mean that public officials are
going to have to surround themselves with high-level policy
makers from the opposition party. "I couldn't run my office
if it was unresponsive to my political beliefs," says
Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, another
gubernatorial candidate.
   Some political experts think that George Washington
Plunkitt might have been onto something in the first place.
   "This is a real blow for the strong, local political party
machine," says Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College
specialist on state government. "There are very important
benefits that strong local parties bring to government, and
that may be in jeopardy."
   The decision wasn't a complete surprise to state and local
officials because the Supreme Court, in two previous
decisions in 1976 and 1980, ruled that government officials
couldn't fire public employees because they weren't loyal to
the party in power. That ruling eliminated the widespread
practice of new administrations -- from governor to fire
commissioner -- coming into office and ousting legions of
workers who were carried over from prior officeholders.
   The high court said the reasoning of the earlier rulings
-- that patronage firings forced workers to support and work
for candidates and parties that they preferred not to support
-- applied to decisions to hire and promote.
   The case arose as a challenge by five Illinois residents
to the patronage practice initiated when Gov. Thompson
imposed a hiring freeze on state jobs in 1980. The lawsuit
charged that the freeze was used to give the governor's
office, in conjunction with the Illinois Republican party,
control more than 60,000 state jobs. The five who sued
alleged they were denied promotions, layoff recalls, or a
chance to be hired because they lacked Republican
credentials.
   A federal court in Chicago dismissed the lawsuit before a
trial, saying patronage-based transfers, promotions, and
hiring didn't raise any constitutional problems. An appeals
court in Chicago agreed, ruling that only employment
decisions that have the same effect as a discharge violate
the First Amendment.
   The high court reversed the appeals court ruling and sent
the cases back to the district court for a trial.
   Joining Justice Scalia in dissent were Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra O'Connor and Anthony
Kennedy.
   In a concurring opinion, Justice John Stevens said the
patronage system has transformed President Kennedy's charge
to serve the nation into, "Ask not what job applicants can do
for the state -- ask what they can do for our party."
