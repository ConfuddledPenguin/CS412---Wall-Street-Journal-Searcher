   It may have seemed impossible, but Madison Avenue has
taken ad clutter to new extremes.
   Many packaged-goods advertisers are breaking conventional
marketing wisdom by running ads stuffed with pitches for two,
three, some times more than four separate products.

   A new commercial from Colgate-Palmolive starts with a
tired little kid marching up to the sink for a morning brush
with Colgate Junior toothpaste. Then the ad shifts to an
older kid stuffing a tube of regular Colgate into a backpack.
Cut to a shot of construction workers jackhammering the
street -- and a pitch for Colgate anti-cavity mouth rinse.
Then on to Colgate tartar control toothpaste and two types of
Colgate toothbrushes. All in 60 seconds.
   Colgate is hardly alone in its approach.
   Ralston Purina is working on a commercial that will
simultaneously pitch its Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Hi-Pro and Fit
&amp; Trim dog foods. Johnson &amp; Johnson recently began a campaign
for its line of Tylenol products, including CoTylenol cold
medicine, Tylenol allergy medicine and children's Tylenol.
Guinness's U.S. importer just began running an ad that plugs
its Guinness Stout and Guinness Gold beers.
   Such "line campaigns" may stem in part from tighter ad
budgets, but advertisers who use them say they also
capitalize on the growing belief that the name of the company
itself -- not just its brand names -- is a powerful selling
point.
   Some advertising specialists, though, say that isn't
necessarily the case. Stuffed ads can backfire, these experts
say, because the individual brands' identities suffer, while
the more general corporate pitch may not pack as powerful a
punch with brand-conscious consumers.
   "This very well could be self-defeating," says Charlie
Moss, vice chairman at ad agency Wells, Rich, Greene in New
York. "I'm sure there are brands where this clearly wouldn't
work. There are times when consumers would be confused by a
general commercial that lumps together brands with very
conflicting images."
   Marketing gurus say past ad campaigns that have tried to
link disparate brands under a corporate umbrella have fared
poorly. A few years back, a campaign for Beatrice Cos.
linking varied brands from Stiffel lamps to Martha White
grits was met with widespread derision.
   Today, often mentioned as a disastrously confusing spot is
one by Van Munching &amp; Co. that has two pitchmen on a split
screen simultaneously talking up its Heineken and Amstel
Light beers. Not only is the ad hard to follow, skeptics say,
but also the two brands have very different targets that
can't be courted effectively in the same ad. Not so, says Bob
Fiore, at Van Munching's ad agency Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore.
"The audience is very, very similar." He adds, though, that
cost was one strong factor in deciding on the double pitch.
   Similarly, skeptics already question Ralston's planned
effort to promote four very different dog food brands in one
ad. Marketing specialists say the company is threatening to
walk away from all the time and money it has invested
developing unique personalities for each of its dog food
brands.
   "The brands are so strong on their own, I really have a
hard time understanding that one," says Jack Vogler, senior
vice president at Landor &amp; Associates, San Francisco-based
identity specialists. "It really doesn't sound like it's
going to do any one brand a whole helluva lot of good. This
is a really competitive marketplace."
   Ralston declines to comment on its new campaign. But the
ads are expected to focus on a general pitch for Ralston
brand dog food, while also briefly describing each of the
four brands.
   Some advertisers say the real power in a line campaign is
its ability to help bolster a company's corporate image while
reminding consumers of the products it makes. "We think this
is an interesting and involving way to tell American
consumers who may not be aware that Colgate has in fact this
multiplicity of products," says Ed Fogarty, president of
Colgate U.S. The new Colgate campaign replaces its "Wisdom
Tooth" ads, which featured actor Pat Morita of the "Karate
Kid" movies.
   Colgate and Johnson &amp; Johnson, though, aren't putting all
their money on the line campaigns. Both say they plan to
continue supporting individual brands with separate ads.
   A spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson's McNeil Consumer
Products unit calls the Tylenol campaign "supplemental
layover" in addition to the usual brand advertising. "We see
this as just a different approach to the everyday competitive
advertising," he says. The Tylenol effort, the first-ever
line campaign for the brand, began in April.
   Ralston says it isn't yet clear what ads, if any, it will
continue to run on its individual brands once the line
campaign starts. Ralston is expected to spend about $25
million on the line campaign.
   Colgate says it's finishing new ads for individual brands
that will be crafted in the same visual style as the line
campaign. The ads will feature the same theme song as the
line ads, but they will more prominently feature
brand-specific information, Mr. Fogarty says.
   "Our basic belief is that the umbrella commercial alone
wouldn't be enough," he says. "We did some preliminary
testing just before going on the air that was encouraging,
but the jury is out relative to whether the thing will work,"
he says.

   Hill Holliday Gets Lotus
                                                                                                       

   Lotus Development pulled its $10 million to $12 million ad
account from Scali, McCabe, Sloves and awarded it to Boston's
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
   Scali McCabe had won the software company's account just
last November after a review that also included Hill
Holliday. But Lotus said it moved the account because it
wanted an agency closer to its Cambridge, Mass.,
headquarters.
   In an unusual move, Lotus said two of its marketing
executives will take offices at Hill Holliday to work more
closely with the agency executives working on its account.
   "We think they {Scali} have been doing a nice job," said
Kelsey Selander, Lotus vice president of marketing
communications. "But we wanted to totally marry our internal
creative program with our agency. We wanted to work with an
agency at home."

   PERRIER ASSIGNMENT: Perrier Group of America, Greenwich,
Conn., named Young &amp; Rubicam, New York, to handle the
media-buying assignment for its imported and domestic bottled
water brands, including Perrier, Poland Spring and others.
The unit of Source Perrier S.A. said Young &amp; Rubicam will be
responsible for $24 million in media billings. Media-buying
responsibilities had been handled by a number of different
agencies.
                                                                                                       

   BILLBOARD COMPLAINT: The Coalition on Smoking or Health
dismissed the Outdoor Advertising Association of America's
new "code of advertising practices" as "one more cynical
public-relations ploy." The ad association, a trade group,
announced suggested guidelines restricting the placement of
tobacco and alcohol billboards earlier this week.
                                                                                                       

   PLAYBOY CAMPAIGN: A new trade advertising campaign for
Playboy magazine features "centerfold" pictures of some of
the magazine's biggest advertisers. One ad features a
fold-out picture of Bob Greenberg, general manager at
Panasonic. The tag line, "I've appeared in Playboy more times
than Bo Derek," refers to the many times the company has
purchased ad pages in Playboy. The campaign was created by
Kaye/Donna/Pearlstein.
