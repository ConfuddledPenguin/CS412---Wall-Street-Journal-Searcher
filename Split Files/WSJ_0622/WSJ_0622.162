   HONG KONG -- Indosuez Asia Investment Services Ltd. said
it will merge three mutual funds run by Gartmore Fund
Managers (Far East) Ltd. into Indosuez funds and re-register
numerous other Gartmore funds under the Indosuez nameplate.
   Indosuez Asia's parent company, Banque Indosuez of Paris,
bought Gartmore's London parent, Gartmore Investment
Management Ltd., last March for $230 million from British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings PLC, a troubled British
financial-services company. Gartmore had been up for sale
since November 1989.

   Indosuez Asia officials said that Gartmore's Hong Kong
operation will be closed, and that its remaining employees
will be given the option of staying on with Indosuez Asia.
Gartmore funds that are administered in Europe will continue
to carry the Gartmore name as part of Gartmore Indosuez Asset
Management Ltd., the newly created holding company for all
Gartmore-Indosuez fund-management activities world-wide.
   The absorption of Gartmore's Asian-Pacific operations by
Indosuez Asia marks the end of what once was one of the
region's highest-profile fund managers. Under the leadership
of managing director Duncan Mount, now a director at CEF
Investment Management (Bermuda) Ltd. in Hong Kong, several
top-performing Gartmore funds attracted droves of investors
during the bull market of the mid-1980s.
   Then the equities crash of 1987 hit Gartmore's funds hard.
Its Oriental Ventures Trust, a diversified Asian-Pacific fund
that was heavily publicized, lost more than half its value.
Since then, Gartmore has taken a more conservative approach
to managing funds, but the tarnish from the crash never wore
off, according to fund managers and brokers in Hong Kong.
   Indosuez Asia, with more than $1 billion under management,
will pick up about $150 million by absorbing Gartmore's
regional funds, said Robert Lloyd George, managing director
of Indosuez Asia in Hong Kong. World-wide, the merged
Indosuez-Gartmore operations will have about $25 billion
under management.
   Bernard Simon Barboux, a Paris-based executive vice
president of Banque Indosuez, said the acquisition of
Gartmore has given Indosuez new prowess in pension-fund
management. "Gartmore brings us more pension-fund expertise,"
he said. "Indosuez has primarily been involved in unit trusts
and mutual funds. We now plan to expand into the pension-fund
area."
   The move into pension-fund management marks a shift in
corporate culture at Indosuez Asia. Under Mr. Lloyd George,
the company has concentrated on conservatively managed,
diversified retail funds invested in the Asian-Pacific
region. Indosuez Asia also has been a pioneer in the region's
emerging markets; it launched the first international equity
fund that invests in Indonesia, and this month its Himalayan
Fund became the first to invest in India, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and Nepal.
   Mr. Lloyd George said the new emphasis on pension-fund
money won't come at the expense of retail clients,
particularly those now holding Gartmore funds.
   Gartmore funds that will be merged into Indosuez Asia
Funds or re-registered with Hong Kong authorities under the
Indosuez name are: Gartmore International Bond Fund, which
will be merged with Indosuez Asian Income Fund; Gartmore
Singapore &amp; Malaysia Trust, to be merged with Indosuez FIF
Singapore, a Banque Indosuez fund managed by Indosuez Asia;
and Gartmore Precious Metals Trust, to be merged with
Indosuez Pacific Gold Fund.
   These Gartmore funds will carry the Indosuez Asia
nameplate: Japan Fund, Oriental Ventures Trust, Hong Kong
Fund, Managed Trust, New Zealand Fund, North American Trust,
Pacific Trust, and Pacific Warrant Fund.
