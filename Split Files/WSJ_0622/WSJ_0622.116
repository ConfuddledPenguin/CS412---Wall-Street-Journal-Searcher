   WASHINGTON -- William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., was in satisfactory condition in
Santa Fe, N.M., yesterday following surgery for a separated
hip.
   Mr. Seidman, who also heads the government's
savings-and-loan cleanup efforts, was injured in a
horse-riding accident at his ranch in Santa Fe Wednesday, the
agency said. He was in New Mexico delivering a speech to
banking executives. Mr. Seidman yesterday had to bow out of a
scheduled appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to
discuss bank-lending standards.

   It wasn't clear how long he would be in the hospital, but
an FDIC spokesman said it would probably be at least several
days. "I knew he was OK when I heard he ordered a fax machine
and a private telephone line in his room," the spokesman
said. Mr. Seidman is widely expected to leave his posts in
autumn.
