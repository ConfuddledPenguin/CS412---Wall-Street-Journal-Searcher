   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith
may yet fulfill his vow to drive GM's long-awaited Saturn car
off the assembly line before his Aug. 1 retirement. But now
it appears Saturn will conduct this ceremony in private.
   Saturn officials worry that television footage of Mr.
Smith smiling from behind the wheel of one of Saturn's
compact coupes or sedans might undercut the unit's efforts to
woo back import buyers hostile to GM. That is one of the main
purposes of Saturn, which is wrestling with how to be part of
GM but yet appear apart.

   As recently as the GM annual meeting May 25, Mr. Smith
reaffirmed his longstanding pledge to drive the first Saturn
off the assembly line.
   So-called drive-off ceremonies are traditional in the auto
industry; auto makers usually view such occasions as free
publicity for a new model.
   But a Saturn spokesman says the GM subsidiary may not
invite reporters because it doesn't want them to see the car
and scoop the subsidiary's plans for a launch late this fall.
   Another reason that may be more critical, Saturn officials
concede, is that Mr. Smith could be a marketing liability.
   "You could build a case for that," acknowledges Donald
Hudler, head of Saturn's sales, service and marketing
operations. He says Saturn will benefit from the fact that
outside auto industry circles, most people don't know who Mr.
Smith is or what Saturn is. "I view that as good because we
don't have to change something," he says. Privately, Saturn
executives are more blunt.
   California Saturn dealer Russell Hand says the whole issue
of Mr. Smith's drive is an unwelcome distraction.
   "Saturn's emphasis should be in talking about what's new
and different and not getting bogged down with any baggage
from the past," he says.
   A GM spokesman says Saturn officials have never mentioned
any concern about linking Mr. Smith to their car. He says GM
doesn't go much for drive-off ceremonies anyway, no matter
what the product is.
   But the awkwardness over Mr. Smith highlights one of
Saturn's thorniest marketing problems: how to establish an
identity separate from a parent company whose image is
anathema to the new car's target buyers. It would be an issue
with any GM chairman, but is especially so with Mr. Smith.
   Mr. Smith is the most visible GM chairman in years, and
his stewardship of GM has been controversial. GM's market
share has plunged 10 points during his tenure. He was
portrayed as a villain in a recent film about the decline of
Flint, Mich. Several books about GM in the 1980s have offered
unflattering portraits as well. Mr. Smith recently drew fire
from some big GM holders for backing a revised pension plan
that almost doubled his annual retirement pay to $1.2
million.
   Saturn officials say they don't plan to feature the GM
connection in advertising. "We probably will not align too
much with GM," a spokesman says.
   Just when the drive-off ceremony -- public or private --
will occur isn't clear. "I can't answer that," the spokesman
says. "We don't have a date."
