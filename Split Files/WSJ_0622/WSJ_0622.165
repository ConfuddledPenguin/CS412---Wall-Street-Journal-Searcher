   WYOMISSING, Pa. -- VF Corp., suffering from a weak apparel
market, said it expects to report a drop of about 47% in
second-quarter per-share earnings, or 35 cents to 36 cents a
share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, VF posted earnings of $45.5
million, or 67 cents a share. In addition, the company said
it expects to post slightly lower sales for the quarter. In
the year-ago quarter, sales were $611 million.

   The apparel manufacturer said the projected results
include two special charges: a charge of about three cents a
share related to the cost of closing several jeans production
facilities, and another charge of about two cents a share to
cover potential liabilities connected to the sale of the
company's Wrangler Canada operations.
   VF's chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence R.
Pugh, attributed the earnings decline to continued weak
clothing demand, particularly for the company's Lee jeanswear
and its Jantzen sportswear.
   "Apparel sales are not vibrant," Mr. Pugh said. He added
that low consumer demand for jeans was compounded by cutbacks
in advance orders by retailers, who are increasingly relying
on "at-once" orders to keep inventories down.
   However, Mr. Pugh said he expects jeans orders to pick up
in the third quarter with the back-to-school rush. In
addition, Mr. Pugh said he is confident that the Lee division
will show improved results in the second half of the year as
it reaps the benefits of internal reorganization, more
focused product lines and a new advertising campaign directed
at women 25 to 35 years old.
   Mr. Pugh emphasized that other VF units, including Vanity
Fair lingerie and Red Kap occupational apparel, are doing
better than last year.
