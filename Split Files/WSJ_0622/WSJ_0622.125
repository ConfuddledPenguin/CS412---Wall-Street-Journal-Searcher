   Serious obstacles remained in talks between Donald Trump
and his bankers, as attention temporarily shifted to an
Atlantic City courtroom where the developer and casino owner
was dealt a setback.
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge Anthony Gibson denied a
motion by Mr. Trump to dismiss claims by the Pratt Hotel
Corp. that he violated antitrust laws. The decision paves the
way for a fall trial pitting Pratt against Mr. Trump and
Penthouse International Ltd.

   Pratt claims that Mr. Trump improperly interfered with its
contract with Penthouse to build a casino next to the Trump
Plaza casino. If Mr. Trump loses that antitrust case, he
could be subject to treble damages. Pratt officials have said
the total damages could be as high as $600 million.
   An attorney for Mr. Trump said the developer intends to
submit another motion for summary judgment, after pre-trial
fact finding is completed.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's bankers grew more pessimistic in
what has developed into marathon restructuring talks. Seven
banks have agreed to advance Mr. Trump $65 million, and about
70 smaller creditors are being asked to forgo some interest
payments on $2 billion in loans to Mr. Trump.
   But a full day of negotiations has yet to persuade a group
of four foreign banks who have purchased portions of loans
issued Mr. Trump by Chase Manhattan Corp. to approve certain
aspects of the deal. The four banks, Mitsubishi Trust &amp;
Banking Corp., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
and Dresdner Bank AG, have senior secured positions on Mr.
Trump's $75 million first mortgage on Trump Tower in New
York.
   The banks are scheduled to meet with Chase again today.
   Thursday, two banks that purchased parts of Chase's $200
million loan secured by Mr. Trump's West Side rail site, also
balked at the deal, according to a person close to the
negotiations. Those banks are said to be Yasuda Trust &amp;
Banking Co. (Japan) and Canada's Societe General de
Financement du Quebec.
   In order for the deal to go forward, the lenders with
secured loans must approve junior liens that would be put on
their properties. The addition of junior liens to fully
secured properties is still the proposal's largest stumbling
block.
   Many of Mr. Trump's unsecured foreign lenders are also
said to be still communicating with their home offices, and
have not yet definitively gone along with the proposal,
though they are considered less troublesome than the secured
lenders.
   With each passing day, time has become Mr. Trump's
greatest enemy, as he must finalize the restructuring
proposal by Tuesday night. At midnight Tuesday, he will be in
default of $43 million in bond payments and would almost
certainly lose control of Trump's Castle. The default could
also trigger defaults on some of Mr. Trump's other
properties.
   Lawyers and bankers are now working to put the papers in
order, so they will be prepared in case the deal is agreed to
by Tuesday.

   MITSUBISHI TRUST &amp; BANKING Corp. was incorrectly described
in Friday's edition as one of the banks opposed to a $65
million loan to Donald Trump. The bank was Mitsubishi Bank.
