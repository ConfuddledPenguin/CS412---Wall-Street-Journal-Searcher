   SYDNEY, Australia -- Massive write-downs on investments
are expected to wipe out the earnings of Elders IXL Ltd. in
the fiscal year ending this month. They could even force the
giant Australian brewing conglomerate to post hefty losses.
   Furthermore, some analysts believe Elders may have to trim
its annual dividend, which would tighten the financial noose
around the company's cash-strapped controlling shareholder,
Harlin Holdings Pty., a closely held concern associated with
John Elliott, chairman of Elders.

   Estimates of the write-downs vary widely, but one thing is
clear, according to Craig Drummond, an analyst at the
Melbourne brokerage firm of J.B. Were &amp; Son: There "isn't a
lot left" in terms of earnings for the year ending June 30.
   In their projections, analysts see write-downs ranging
anywhere from 500 million Australian dollars (US$391.6
million) to nearly A$1 billion. According to these estimates,
Elders at best would report no profit for the fiscal year,
after deducting taxes and extraordinary and so-called
abnormal losses. The worst scenario would be a loss of about
A$500 million. In the previous year, Elders earned A$653
million, after tax and abnormal gains.
   An Elders spokesman said company policy is not to comment
on "analysts' speculation." He also declined to discuss the
prospects of a dividend cut, saying that "dividends aren't
finalized." Elders expects to report its unaudited annual
results in September and audited accounts in October, the
spokesman said.
   However, a source close to Elders said Peter Bartels, the
recently named chief executive who is taking over day-to-day
management from Mr. Elliott, favors "taking the write-downs
all at once and ending up with a clean sheet" for
still-to-be-created Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. Foster's
Brewing Group, after a restructuring of Elders, would hold
the company's far-flung brewing interests, which now rank as
the fourth largest in the world.
   Prolonged high interest rates in Australia are undermining
asset values. That, coupled with a spate of corporate
problems partly unleashed by tight credit, is putting
pressure on company auditors to get tough with investment
valuations.
   In the first half ended Dec. 31, Elders wrote off A$123
million, partly resulting from its investment in a
stockbroking unit, against after-tax operating profit of
A$286.9 million. Several analysts forecast that Elders's
operating profit in the second half will be about A$200
million. But unless the company meets with quick success in
its campaign to sell assets, analysts expect to see hefty
write-downs on investments such as a 43% interest in Elders
Resources NZFP Ltd., which has interests in coal, gold, oil
and forest products, mainly in New Zealand.
   In March, Elders announced a major restructuring that
effectively calls for the dismantling of the conglomerate
that Mr. Elliott built from a jam maker. Now best known for
its Foster's beer, Elders is the biggest brewer in Australia
and an important brewer in Britain through its Courage Ltd.
unit, and in Canada through a joint venture with Molson Cos.
   The restructuring also calls for many of the company's
assets in agribusiness, natural resources and finance to be
sold. But divestitures have come slowly and bank lenders to
both Harlin and Elders have grown more nervous. Moreover, the
lack of high offers raises questions about the value
currently assigned to the assets on Elders's books.
   Elders had planned to raise about A$2.2 billion, or A$1 a
share, from asset sales, distributing the proceeds to
shareholders. The move was designed to relieve some of the
financial pressure on Harlin, which controls about 55% of
Elders. The first capital repayment of 50 Australian cents a
share to holders was to have been made about now and the
second in early 1991.
   But Elders announced earlier this month that it intends to
defer the payout while it restructures its debt. Elders
currently has financial arrangements with more than 100
international banks; it is trying to pare down that number
and also soothe some jittery banks by increasing their
security for certain loans. Some analysts say bank lenders
are taking a stricter line with Elders management and want to
have more say over capital outflows, such as the proposed
shareholder payout and the company's dividend payments.
   In the previous fiscal year, Elders paid an annual
dividend of 20.5 Australian cents a share. The company
already has paid a half-year dividend of 8.5 cents a share;
to maintain last year's level, adjusted for a bonus issue, it
would have to make the full-year payout at least 17 cents a
share.
   "If people are looking for 17 cents to 18 cents a share, I
think they'll be disappointed," said Viktor Shvets, an
analyst at Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.
