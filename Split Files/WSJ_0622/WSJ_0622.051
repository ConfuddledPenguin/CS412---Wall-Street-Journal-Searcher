   According to the Washington Post, Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski is determined to make his
bureaucrats write in language that non-bureaucrats can
understand. He even brought in a language specialist who has
collected gems of bureaucratese: a traffic light is an
"electronically adjusted, color-coded, vehicular flow-control
mechanism"; a parachute is an "individual aerial deceleration
mechanism"; a shovel is a "combat emplacement evacuator";
waves are "sea-air interface climactic disturbances." We of
course wish Sec. Derwinski luck, but we're intrigued by the
bureaucrats' amazing, almost incredible skill to conceal the
real meaning of simple nouns. As the saying goes, someone
should bottle it. A real entrenpreneur would find a way to
put this stuff in a box and sell it as a $25 party game
guaranteed to provide hours of puzzlement, laughter and
shrieks of disbelief.
