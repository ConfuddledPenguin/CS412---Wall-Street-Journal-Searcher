   WILMINGTON -- Du Pont Co. said it plans to design four
"world scale" plants to produce its line of
hydrofluorocarbons, the diversified chemical company's
nonozone-depleting alternative to chlorofluorocarbons.
   The plants, planned for Corpus Christi, Texas; Louisville,
Ky.; Dordrecht, the Netherlands; and Chiba, Japan, are to
become operational between 1992 and 1995, Du Pont said.

   A spokeswoman said the plants will be capable of producing
more than 140 million pounds of hydrofluorocarbons annually
and could supply most world-wide needs through the end of the
century. Hydrofluorocarbons are used in refrigeration
products. The plants are to produce hydrofluorocarbons 134a,
152a and 125 for auto air conditioners, appliances and
commercial refrigeration.
   Du Pont said its overall costs of commercializing its line
of chlorofluorocarbon alternatives could total more than $1
billion in research, development and capital projects,
including $240 million invested through 1990 and projected
costs over the next 10 years. The company wouldn't say how
much it plans to invest in the four plants.
   The sites in the Netherlands and Japan would add to Du
Pont's alternatives plants in Maitland, Ontario, and
Humberside, Britain, the company said.
   Du Pont had 1989 sales of $750 million from its freon
products division, which produces hydrofluorocarbons.
