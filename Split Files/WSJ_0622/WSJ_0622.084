   LANSING, Mich. -- Maxco Inc. expects to report profit from
continuing operations for the year ended March 31 of about
five to six cents a share, or between $300,000 and $400,000.
But earnings "absolutely" will improve in fiscal 1991, Max
Coon, chairman, president and chief executive, said.
   In the fourth quarter, Mr. Coon said seasonal losses in
the company's construction materials business may have more
than cut in half the $737,000, or 13 cents a share, profit
from continuing operations accumulated in the first nine
months. In fiscal 1989, profit from continuing operations was
$425,000, or six cents a share.

   A one-time gain of $650,000, or 13 cents a share, from an
accounting change will put net income for fiscal 1990 at
about 18 cents to 19 cents a share, or about $1 million,
compared with a year-earlier net loss, including losses from
discontinued operations, of $1.4 million, Mr. Coon said.
   For fiscal 1991, Mr. Coon said Maxco expects improved
profits to come primarily from an anticipated sale gain of
20% or better in its auto refinishing paint distribution
business, improved margins in its construction materials
operations, and profits from a 40%-owned factory automation
subsidiary, Medar Inc. Maxco had losses related to its Medar
stake fiscal 1990, Mr. Coon said.
   "We don't have the negatives we've been through for a
period of years," Mr. Coon said.
   Mr. Coon expects profit from continuing operations in the
first quarter ending June 30 to show "an improvement" from
the year-earlier $305,000, or six cents a share.
   Maxco recently expanded its auto paint supply distribution
operations into Chicago, and expects revenues from that
business to grow to $33 million in fiscal 1991 from $27
million in fiscal 1990.
   The auto refinishing business "is our main area of
expansion," Mr. Coon said.
