   LONDON -- Is Sir James Goldsmith tiring of the takeover
game?
   Anglo Group PLC, an investment company controlled by the
Anglo-French financier and allied British investor Lord
Rothschild, agreed to sell an equipment-leasing unit for #120
million ($69.7 million). The move, in the wake of Sir James's
failed B.A.T Industries PLC takeover bid, raises some new
questions about the famed corporate raider's continuing
appetite for the takeover game in Europe.

   Sir James, who last year made a much-ballyhooed return to
European investing after souring on U.S. takeovers, has had
mixed results thus far. His #13 billion B.A.T bid was
rebuffed by a radical corporate restructuring by the U.K.
tobacco and financial services giant, and Sir James recently
sold most of his B.A.T stake. Through Anglo and other
companies, Sir James and Lord Rothschild have controlled a
29.9% stake in U.K. food producer Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC
for more than a year without making a bid.
   Anglo said it agreed to sell its only operating
subsidiary, its leasing unit, to closely held financial group
Summit Group PLC for #120 million. The move leaves the Ranks
Hovis McDougall holding as Anglo's "most significant
investment," according to an Anglo statement. The statement
added Anglo's directors have been reassessing long-term
strategy since the B.A.T bid failed and "are actively
reviewing the range of options." They will give a further
indication of strategy next month.
   Because Anglo will have no operating businesses, the
disposal limits Anglo's ability to list its shares on the
London market. That, in turn, could dull its teeth as a
corporate raider by restricting the company's ability to
issue listed securities in any bid. As a result, traders said
yesterday's announcement dimmed hopes of a rapid Ranks Hovis
McDougall bid. RHM shares rose six pence to 356 pence on
London's stock market. Anglo shares were suspended at 173
pence.
   Sir James is known for unexpected moves. And it is all but
certain the legendary financier won't take all his marbles
from the table. However, he could be toning down his
activities somewhat. In a recent conversation, the
57-year-old financier described himself as "semiretired."
   His recent moves come as the takeover game becomes
increasingly difficult for financial bidders such as Sir
James because of high interest rates, growing doubts over
debt-financed acquisitions and mounting regulatory
resistance. Meanwhile, obvious targets are harder to find
because many companies have taken steps to increase value for
shareholders to forestall bids. After over two decades at the
center of global mergers, Sir James has spent much of this
year traveling in the Far East and vacationing at his Mexican
estate.
   People who work closely with the financier say that while
he still considers himself an active investor, he no longer
seeks to manage any company he controls. But a colleague also
warned against drawing conclusions from the announcement.
"There are plenty of options, and we are looking at all of
them," the colleague said. Whether Sir James decides to
pounce again will depend as much on circumstances at the
moment as on his determination to stay semi-retired.
   Anglo has five main options. It could bid for RHM. Or it
could seek another target and keep its stock-exchange
listing. Anglo could distribute the RHM shares to holders, or
try to list on another exchange. Or it could buy the 25% of
Anglo that Sir James and Lord Rothschild's interests don't
already own. The company is expected to disclose further
details by its annual meeting July 25.
