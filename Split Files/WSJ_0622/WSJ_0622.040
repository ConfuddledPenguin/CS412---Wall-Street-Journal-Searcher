   The chemicals industry continues its downward cycle, with
weak commodity prices expected to reduce overall
second-quarter earnings 15% to 20% from a year ago. Earnings
have perked up slightly since the first quarter, aided by
seasonal improvements and prices stabilizing at lower levels.
But the industry slump is expected to continue for at least
two more quarters.
   The more-cyclical, commodity-chemical and plastics
companies will see declines in the 30% to 35% range because
selling prices have dropped precipitously from peak levels a
year ago. Companies in this group include Quantum Chemical
Corp., Union Carbide Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.

   The trend for diversified and specialty chemical makers,
such as Du Pont Co. and Monsanto Corp., is generally flat for
the second quarter. However, earnings will vary widely from
10% up to 10% down, depending on the company's individual
product mix. Despite generally strong demand and pricing,
many companies were hurt by weakness in major economic
sectors, including agriculture, automobiles and construction.
In addition, demand for synthetic fibers was down.
   The biggest factor in the overall second-quarter decline
is the 20% drop in selling prices for commodity chemicals,
triggered by excess capacity. Yet prices were better than
expected because maintenance and weather-related problems
idled much of the new capacity added in 1989. Nontheless,
prices for ethylene and its derivatives, for example, dropped
30% to 23 cents a pound, from 33 cents a pound in the
year-ago quarter. Styrene-plastic prices fell 17% to 38 cents
a pound, from 46 cents.
   In the commodity group, Quantum Chemical is expected to
report the worst year-to-year comparison because of its
exposure to polyethylene, which represents 60% to 70% of
earnings. The company won't get the full benefit of the
restart of its Morris, Ill., plant and a recent polyethylene
price increase, says Charles LoCastro of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. He says equity earnings will be
affected by losses in a propane marketing joint-venture.
Several estimates range from break-even to $1 a share. A year
ago, the New York-based company had income from continuing
operations of $46 million, or $1.85 a share, on sales of
$672.5 million.
   Similarly, Union Carbide's earnings are likely to be cut
in half by soft selling prices for polyethylene and ethylene
glycol, a major product used in antifreeze. In addition,
Brazil's economic austerity program is likely to cut the
Danbury, Conn.-based concern's earnings about seven cents a
share, says Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. Estimates range from about 60 cents to 70 cents a share.
A year ago, Carbide had net income of $186 million, or $1.33
a share, on sales of $2.28 billion.
   For Dow Chemical, demand is holding for chemicals and
plastics. But profits will be hurt by weak prices and auto
industry exposure, as well as market softness and plant
maintenance shutdowns in Europe. Estimates range from $1.85
to $2 a share. A year ago, the Midland, Mich.-based concern
earned $728 million, or $2.70 a share, on sales of $4.60
billion.
   In the diversified group, American Cyanamid Co. is
expected to be among the leaders, with a 10% to 15% gain. The
Lederle pharmaceutical unit, which accounts for half of the
company's profit, is expected to show a strong 20% profit
improvement. Poor weather reduced expected gains in
agricultural chemicals, causing some analysts to downgrade
estimates to a range of $1.30 to $1.35 a share. A year ago,
Wayne, N.J.-based Cyanamid earned a restated $107.1 million,
or $1.15 a share, on sales of $1.30 billion.
   For Du Pont, earnings are likely to be flat or down
slightly from peak levels in the year-ago second quarter.
Most business segments will be flat. But fibers will be down
modestly as a result of weak demand for apparel fibers, such
as polyester and orlon, says Paul Leming of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. With wet weather hurting agricultural chemical sales and
mining operations, estimates range from 95 cents to $1. A
year ago, Wilmington, Del.,-based DuPont earned $714 million,
or $1 a share, on sales of $9.28 billion.
   Several analysts say Monsanto earnings will be flat
because of weak demand for agricultural chemicals, which
account for 20% of the company's sales and nearly 40% of
profit. Wet weather delayed farm planting and reduced
acreage. The downturn in automobiles and housing should
slightly reduce chemical profit. The NutraSweet unit is
expected to do well and drugs will be modestly up. Estimates
range from $3.50 to $3.80. A year ago, St. Louis-based
Monsanto earned $241 million, or $3.54 a share, on sales of
$2.35 billion.
   Ethyl Corp. is expected to gain 10% to 25% with strong
positions in a variety of specialty chemicals. The company
will benefit from improved sales of olefins used in
polyethylene production, antiknock gasoline additives,
bromine and lubricant additives. Estimates range from 47
cents to 54 cents a share. A year earlier, the Richmond,
Va.-based company earned from continuing operations $51.0
million, or 42 cents a share, on sales of $602.6 million.
   For Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc., earnings are expected
to be flat. Industrial gases are expected to grow 5% to 10%,
balancing a 20% downturn in chemicals. Several estimates
range from $1 to $1.08. A year ago, the Allentown, Pa.-based
concern earned $56.6 million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of
$669 million.
