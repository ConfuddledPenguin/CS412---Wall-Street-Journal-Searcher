   NEW YORK -- In the beginning there was Alexander Graham
Bell's invention. Then rotary-dial phones eventually gave way
to today's push-button models. Could SmartPhone be next?
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has developed a phone
for receiving advanced telecommunications and information
services and is talking with regional Bell and independent
phone companies about mass distribution of the system.

   Called SmartPhone, the product -- which AT&amp;T is pushing as
the successor to the ubiquitous Touch-Tone phone -- is simple
to operate. Yet it comprises a sophisticated, "intelligent"
computer terminal with a touch-screen display and a built-in
modem. AT&amp;T has also designed network processors that would
enable the phone company to provide the service.
   The SmartPhone has a 4-by-6 1/2-inch screen with big
numbers that people push to dial a number or gain access to a
service. At the press of part of the screen, users call up a
local company's entire phone listings or automatically turn
on services such as Call Waiting and Voice Mail. But there's
more. The idea is to deliver all kinds of phone and
information services to the home inexpensively by making a
service vendor, such as a bank or an information company, a
partner with the phone company in distributing the phones and
delivering the service.
   AT&amp;T faces considerable obstacles, however, including
competing systems from other suppliers. And there is no
guarantee that state regulators will let local phone
companies provide all of SmartPhone's services.
   Michael Grisham, manager of strategic planning at AT&amp;T
Network Systems and a former Bell Laboratories engineer who
came up with the SmartPhone concept, insists SmartPhone isn't
a Trojan horse for eventually infiltrating AT&amp;T personal
computers into phone customers' homes. But SmartPhone is an
easy device for learning how a computer works. Users can
create files and program the product to store hundreds of
phone numbers by categories such as "Emergency" and "Medical"
or use vendors' services in whatever way the user selects. It
will take messages and return calls at the push of a button.
   SmartPhone draws additional computing power from an
outside processor that can either be operated by the phone
company to deliver information for a third party or by the
third-party vendor itself.
   Mr. Grisham estimates that the phone will cost about $200
to $300, on which "we don't expect to make much money."
Rather, he says, the payoff will be in increased phone
traffic, use of special services and orders for AT&amp;T network
equipment to provide the service. He expects the phone to be
bought by the service provider -- either the phone company or
a bank providing a financial service, for example -- and
distributed to phone customers for a fee of $10 to $15 a
month. The $200 to $300 price, as well as the rental charges,
are in the range of what people pay for some high-end
cordless phones.
   Discussions are under way to hold trials of the SmartPhone
system in early 1992, said Mr. Grisham, and regular service
could begin later that year.
   "This is the next-generation phone," said Joshua Harris,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications Inc., a New York-based
market researcher. "AT&amp;T has a good chance of making this the
de facto standard since it has already supplied most of the
systems" that back up the current phone network.
   But AT&amp;T faces stiff competition. Citicorp sells a phone
called the E.T. that provides home banking. Canada's Northern
Telecom Ltd., AT&amp;T's primary U.S. equipment rival, sells a
phone called the Maestro that gives customers access to
several advanced phone-company services. And Northern Telecom
is to announce next Tuesday software that can turn an Apple
Macintosh into a phone-service terminal.
   Moreover, several U.S. phone concerns are testing France's
Minitel and Canada's Alex systems, which use a "dumb"
computer terminal attached to a phone to give customers
access to information services.
   "Our Maestro retails for $136," said Dan O'Connor, vice
president of sales and marketing for Northern Telecom's
Network Terminals Group. "The trend in the market is for a
terminal that's closer to $100. People have a threshold on
what they'll pay." And, he noted, SmartPhone must jump
through some local regulatory hoops before phone companies
can provide the service.
   Initial targets for the SmartPhone service will be phone
companies that price their service by the minute rather than
by flat fees, Mr. Grisham said, as well as telephone
companies that currently use AT&amp;T's Craft Access computer
system, which would drive SmartPhone service.
   Companies that employ measured pricing would be able to
provide the service without having to file a lot of new
tariffs, since a customer would pay a small monthly charge
for service and be billed on a per-minute basis at the
regular call rate. Nynex Corp.'s New York and New England
telephone units currently price their services in this
manner. Nynex also uses the Craft Access System, as do the
phone companies of Ameritech, BellSouth Corp. and Bell
Atlantic Corp.
   "We think (SmartPhone) is a pretty good approach," said
Stephen Solcz, staff director of network planning at Nynex
Service Co. "We're just not prepared at this time to say it's
the right architecture. We're nowhere near making any
commitment to a trial."
   Providing SmartPhone service will require a simple
software upgrade of the phone company's existing Craft Access
System, according to Mr. Grisham. That system, which he
helped develop, now is used by the phone company's service
agents to access maintenance data through the phone line
while on a service call.
   "The cost of entry for the phone company is low since the
systems are already in place," said Mr. Grisham. "A phone
company would just have to add a processor and some new
software to start service." And it requires no new training.
   AT&amp;T plans to publish specifications later this year that
will permit other manufacturers to build their own smart
phones to work with the AT&amp;T system along with the processors
that drive it.
   "The days when you could lock anybody into a proprietary
interface are long gone, especially among phone company
customers," said Mr. Grisham. "We're dead serious about this.
Our goal has been universal information service. . . . We
don't expect to (provide) that by ourselves."
