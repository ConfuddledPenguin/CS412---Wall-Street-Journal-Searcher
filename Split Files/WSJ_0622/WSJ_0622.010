   One cat's fish could be another cat's "poisson," but would
that make it gourmet? The answer is the subject of a
tooth-and-claw battle between rival makers of canned cat
food.
   The Carnation Co. unit of Nestle S.A. claims its Fancy
Feast Gourmet Cat Food is the "Best tasting gourmet canned
cat food. So moist and delicious cats preferred it over every
other brand." That's got a competitor's back up.

   It's not so, the competitor insisted in a protest filed
with the National Advertising Division of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus, which referees advertising claims.
In fact, the ad cops recently reported, the competitor
produced a "palatability test" between one variety of its
gourmet cat food and Fancy Feast. "Test results indicated
cats ate more of the competitive product," the ad unit
declared.
   Carnation insisted the disgruntled competitor -- unnamed
in the National Advertising Division report -- was splitting
hairs. Indeed, it said, the challenger was really an
"ultra-gourmet sub-segment within the gourmet cat food
segment." A Carnation spokesman says, "In a situation like
this, you often get into a cat fight."
   The Carnation spokesman says gourmet is meant to suggest
especially good taste, as opposed to so-called maintenance
brands that merely keep a cat healthy. He concedes, however,
that "no precise standards" exist to define the concept.
   The competitor, objecting to Carnation's description of
gourmet cat food, "suggested it should be restricted to super
premium/single serve containers," the report disclosed. In
the end, Carnation agreed to change its advertising to merely
claim that cats prefer Fancy Feast over "every leading
brand."
   The National Advertising Division declines to say who
Carnation's challenger was, and Carnation isn't talking,
either.
   Still, industry rumor has it that the challenger was
Kalkan Inc., a Vernon, Calif., unit of Mars Inc., a big,
closely held candy maker that usually says little about its
affairs. Says Kalkan's label on a can of Sheba cat food: "We
guarantee your cat will enjoy Sheba. If not satisfied, send
proof of purchase and state price paid."
   But whether gourmet or not, Fancy Feast seems to be the
current cat's meow. John C. Maxwell Jr., a Wheat First
Securities analyst in Richmond, Va., estimates 1989 retail
sales at $168 million for Fancy Feast and $45 million for
Sheba.
