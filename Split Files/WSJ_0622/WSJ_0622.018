   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Export orders for Taiwanese products in
May rose 2.6% to US$6 billion from the previous month and
represent growth of 4.5% from $5.74 billion in exports a year
earlier, the Economics Ministry said.
   Officials attributed the month-to-month rise to an
increase in orders for machinery and transportation
equipment. Orders for machinery totaled $580 million, up 27%
from the previous month. About 48% of the orders came from
Southeast Asian clients, followed by 21% from the U.S.
Transportation orders increased to $397 million in May from
$323 million in April.

May, up 10% from April but down 0.63% from a year earlier.
