   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved $592 million in
loans to Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   Hungary will get $200 million to support economic reforms
and $100 million to finance projects that will boost
agricultural exports. Yugoslavia will receive $292 million
for highway projects. The World Bank said Yugoslavia plans to
spend about $2.3 billion over the next two years to modernize
its highway network. The bank called the endeavor an
"important" part of the country's drive toward economic
reform and growth.
