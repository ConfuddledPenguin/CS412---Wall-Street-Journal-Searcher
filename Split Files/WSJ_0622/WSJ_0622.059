   Chicago -- There are, as everyone knows, levels of
happiness, and fans of the baseball Chicago White Sox have
been on the "up" escalator of late. At least until this week
their team has been winning, which makes them happy, and the
Chicago Cubs -- those hated North Siders -- have been losing,
which makes them happier.
   And right across 35th Street from Comiskey Park, the Sox's
superannuated home, a handsome new Comiskey Park is rising,
its concrete facing tinted a stylish, uh, pink-beige. It's
scheduled to be ready for opening day 1991, at which time it
will be the newest domicile of any major Chicago professional
sports team by 62 years.

   "My idea of a perfect day is when the Sox win and the Cubs
lose, and we've had a lot of those this season," beamed beefy
Bill Lundeberg, a steel-warehouse superintendent from
Schaumburg, Ill., before the young White Sox -- the young,
second-place White Sox] -- played the California Angels in
old Comiskey on Tuesday night.
   He added: "I won't say I hate the Cubs, because that would
imply I pay attention to them. But I'll say this: This year
we've got the better team, and next year we'll also have the
better park. Can't get much better than two out of two."
   If Mr. L's remarks bespeak a lack of charity, let it be
recalled that a couple of seasons ago White Sox fans weren't
sure they'd have either a ballpark or a ballteam. Comiskey
Park, old but not charming like the cross-town shrine of
Wrigley Field, was crumbling beneath them, and their heroes
were off buying flowered shirts and suntan oil in preparation
for a one-way trip to St. Petersburg, Fla., where
entertainment-starved retirees and a home under a dome
beckoned.
   But the St. Pete threat blew away the political fog that
had hung over the Sox's new-stadium plans for years, and the
Illinois legislature finally agreed to let the taxpayers
spring for the thing, which is the way it's done these days.
Even more remarkably, construction got under way last May,
more or less on time, and it's stayed that way.
   The new park will accommodate 43,000 and is being built
for baseball. That means seats will face home plate instead
of the 50-yard line, and many ticket buyers will be close
enough to the field to see the game. And it won't have the
several dozen roof posts that block the view of all save the
people who sit in the first 20 rows of the present park's
main stand, or in the first eight rows of the upper deck.
   But getting a new stadium okayed and seeing it go up has
been no less startling hereabouts than the performance of the
1990 Sox. With an attendance-cutting resurfacing project on
the adjacent Dan Ryan Expressway just completed, and the new
stadium expropriating much of the nearby parking space, the
team's owners decided a few years back to launch a youth
movement, or, in other words, play on the cheap.
   Jettisoned were such high-salaried vets as pitchers Floyd
Bannister and Rich Dotson and designated-hitter Harold
Baines, traded for younger, friskier and less-demanding types
while an expanded farm system groans into production. Last
year's Sox players' payroll ranked a reported 25th among the
26 big-league teams, and this year's won't be much higher.
The upshot was a 90-loss 1988 season, and a 92-losser last
year. "Mirabile dictu", some of the kids the Sox picked up
could play. And the manner in which they were acquired
suggests a nickname for the current crew, comparable to the
slick "Go-Go" White Sox of the 1950s, the slugging "Hit-Men"
of Bill Veeck's 1977 rent-a-player year, and the "Winning
Ugly" bunch that won the 1983 American League West by 20
games. Call these guys the "Darned" Sox.
   "We patched together a team to save a sinking ship," says
Larry Himes, the ex-California Angels scout who took over the
team's general managership in October 1986. "Our goal was to
become respectable until we could develop our own players,
but it's turning out quite a bit better."
   Indeed, before last Friday the Sox's won-lost record of
36-20 was baseball's third best, behind only Oakland's and
Cincinnati's, and even five losses in seven games with the
Angels and the redoubtable A's through Wednesday didn't
disturb their second spot in the division. Last year, they
didn't win their 38th game until July 19.
   One of the trades that turned the Sox sent Bannister to
Kansas City in 1987 for young pitchers Melido Perez and Greg
Hibbard. Both are starters on a Chicago staff whose earned
run average trails only Oakland's in the league. Sox manager
Jeff Torborg, also a Himes hire, gives Carlton Fisk, his
19-year-veteran catcher, much of the credit for that
achievement. "When Carlton puts down a sign, the kids believe
it," says Torborg.
   The other key deal was a much-maligned 1989 swap that
brought in second-baseman Scott Fletcher, outfielder Sammy
Sosa and a minor-league pitcher from Texas for the beloved
but sore-kneed Baines and another player. Fletcher, 31, has
helped anchor a much-improved Sox infield, and the
21-year-old Sosa, a fleet, muscular outfielder, will be a
star once he learns to do things like touch second base
before rounding it and returning to first after a teammate's
fly out. He neglected to do that Tuesday, and was thrown out.
   The bespectacled Torborg is reputed to be patient about
such miscues, which was one of the reasons he got his job. "I
want our kids to dare to fail," he declares. "I've let 'em
know that nobody's going to jump down their throats every
time they make a mistake. And if they do something right,
they get positive reinforcement."
   They sometimes get PR even if they don't do things right.
After Robin Ventura, a promising rookie whom Himes calls "our
third baseman for the '90s" went through a 0-for-41 hitting
slump, he was moved up to second in the batting order. He's
batted .295 since.
   "We're still experimenting -- trying things -- and we'll
have our downs before the season is through," says Torborg.
"But I think we're past the point of just keeping our fingers
crossed."
