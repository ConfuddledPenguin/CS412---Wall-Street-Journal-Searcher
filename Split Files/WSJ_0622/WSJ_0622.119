   WASHINGTON -- Two major Wall Street firms fired a missile
at a prevalent institutional stock- and bond-trading
practice, asking federal officials to curtail sharply the way
pension funds direct their transactions.
   The letter, from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley
Group Inc. to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, takes on a
lifeblood of Wall Street -- "soft dollars." A barter form of
payment, soft dollars are credits that pension funds and
mutual funds receive from brokerage firms for trading
commissions. The funds use those credits instead of cash to
pay for such things as research, computer services,
economists and client referrals.

   Backers say they help institutions pick and choose the
services they want and allow star Wall Street analysts to
form their own boutique firms. But critics counter that the
soft-dollar business is a quagmire, rife with fraud that
forces pensioners to pay for services that fund managers
should be paying themselves. Moreover, Goldman and Morgan
contend that soft dollars hurt overall market liquidity and
create excess volatility.
   The letter from the two firms points up Wall Street's rift
over the soft-dollar question. Most other brokerages have
reluctantly set up their own soft-dollar units on the
assumption that failing to do so would force business to
other firms. Morgan and Goldman have steadfastly refused to
enter the fray, and now appear to be hoping for regulatory
relief.
   The debate over soft dollars has heated up again in the
past few years as volume since the October 1987 stock-market
crash has remained at sharply lower levels than during the
mid-1980s. Because large institutions, such as mutual funds
and pension funds, have to reimburse soft-dollar brokers for
services no matter how much volume they do, Wall Street firms
without soft-dollar operations are getting a proportionately
smaller share of the pie.
   The two firms asked the Labor Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to: require pension plans
to disclose the extent of soft-dollar deals; clarify the
types of soft-dollar accords that fall outside pension rules;
and then take enforcement action.
   The soft-dollar issue isn't likely to fade soon. "This
goes to the very heart of what's going on on Wall Street,"
said Lee Pickard, a Washington lawyer who represents many
soft-dollar firms. "It's a competitive turf battle."
   The letter and an accompanying report, copies of which
were obtained by this newspaper, were sent several months ago
by Robert Rubin, Goldman's vice chairman, and Richard Fisher,
Morgan Stanley's president. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said
the Labor Department hasn't formally responded. She said that
the letter was a follow-up to an SEC roundtable held last
year on soft dollars, and that Morgan Stanley wanted to
express concern about the use of soft-dollar accords in
fixed-income investing. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
   "It's an area we have been interested in for a number of
years and an area we continue to have interest in," said
Charles Lerner, director of enforcement at the Labor
Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. He
declined to say what the agency might do.
   But the reception from the SEC doesn't appear to be
particularly warm. Robert Colby, chief counsel for market
regulation, said the agency has taken a wait-and-see attitude
toward changing the rules on soft dollars. "There's no
timetable for deciding when to move on any of these
complaints," he said.
   "Obviously for these firms there are competitive concerns
that mingle with altruism and their concerns for the
clients," Mr. Colby said. "That really calls for caution."
   Goldman and Morgan contend in their report that soft
dollars are a major problem for the markets. They estimate
that 30% to 50% of the total trades on the New York Stock
Exchange use soft dollars.
   "The overall consequence of soft-dollar practices on the
securities markets is a decrease in market liquidity, which
can lead to increased market volatility and general
disruption of trading," the report said. Moreover, soft
dollars are hurting the return that pension funds are getting
"because investment managers are not obtaining best execution
of securities trades in transactions involving soft dollars."
   At the heart of the firms' argument is a securities-law
provision called Section 28e, which allows money managers to
use soft-dollar practices if they receive research in return.
If the arrangement meets Section 28e guidelines, practices
that otherwise would violate Employee Retirement Income
Security Act laws are protected from Labor Department
enforcement action.
   But Morgan and Goldman said that pension-plan sponsors
aren't being told how soft dollars are being used. Moreover,
they added that some soft dollars are being used for futures
transactions, in violation of Section 28e, which covers only
securities trades.
   Some soft-dollar firms argue that Goldman and Morgan are
simply engaged in a misguided campaign of sour grapes. "It's
an attempt to restrict competition by lobbying the
regulators," said Don Potts, president of Capital
Institutional Services Inc., a large independent soft-dollar
firm based in Dallas. "The real problem we're dealing with
here is the overcapacity of Wall Street."
