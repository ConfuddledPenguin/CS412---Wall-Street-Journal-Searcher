   Although sales rose 8%, to 589.86 billion yen from 546
billion yen, significantly higher costs of sales, materials
and administration drowned out the gains.

billion yen.
   Net profit fell 15% to 6.05 billion yen, or 6 yen a share,
from 7.1 billion yen, or 7.7 yen a share. The company
recommended the dividend stay at 2.5 yen a share.
   Under the aegis of General Motors Corp., Isuzu is a
