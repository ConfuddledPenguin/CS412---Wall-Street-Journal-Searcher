   NEW YORK -- The bond market snapped out of a four-day
losing streak yesterday as investors brushed aside negative
economic reports and pushed prices moderately higher.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 3/8 point
higher yesterday, a gain of $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased slightly to 8.49%.

   Trading, however, was bumpy. Prices were higher in early
trading due to modest buying on the part of Japanese
investors. But the market moved lower briefly after the
government reported that first-quarter gross national product
was stronger than previously estimated. That was bearish for
bonds because a stronger economy reduces the likelihood that
the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates.
   The market had recovered from the GNP report when the
government reported that the budget deficit widened to $42.55
billion in May from a $25.43 billion deficit a year earlier.
   Traders expected the market to decline sharply on the
news, but instead "the number came out, the market went down
briefly then came right back," said Raymond Stone, a managing
director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates, Princeton,
N.J. "That suggests that there was a strong underlying bid in
the market," he said.
   Speculators who had established "short" positions earlier
in the day, betting prices would slip in response to the May
budget deficit report, were forced to scramble to cover those
positions. That helped to push prices even higher. In a short
sale, dealers and professional traders sell borrowed
securities and later seek to make a profit by replacing what
was borrowed with cheaper securities. Yesterday, that
strategy backfired for some traders.
   Analysts caution against reading too much into yesterday's
rally. "Bond prices can move up and down almost on whim
because of low volume," said Brian Fabbri, a managing
director and chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities
Inc.
   Mr. Fabbri believes notes and bonds will remain stuck in
tight trading bands, continuing the recent pattern, at least
until the release of the June employment report on July 6.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The payment-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. stumbled
after enjoying a robust run-up on Wednesday. Payment-in-kind
bonds, which are extremely volatile, pay interest in the form
of more securities instead of cash.
   Junk-bond traders attributed the declines to light
profit-taking and some investor skepticism about plans to
refinance the debt-burdened company.
   Prices of both RJR payment-in-kind issues, which rose more
than six points Wednesday on news that the company's major
shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., is considering
retiring a "significant amount" of its high-yield bonds,
finished down more than one point.
   RJR Nabisco 14.07% convertible payment-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 1/2 points at 95 5/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the
14.07% exchangeable payment-in-kind debentures, maturing in
2007, ended 1 1/4 points lower to close at 79 3/8. Trading in
the RJR payment-in-kind issues was relatively light after
Wednesday's frenzied pace.
   In the broader junk bond market, most high-yielding,
high-risk bonds finished the session little changed. In the
investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade corporate
bonds ended unchanged to 1/8 point higher.
   Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Trump Castle Funding Inc. and
related issues weakened slightly on a report that a $65
million loan package for real estate developer Donald Trump
is being held up by a consortium of four foreign banks.
   Trump Castle's 13.75% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1997,
ended at 59 1/2, down 1/2 point from Wednesday, while Trump
Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first-mortgage bonds, maturing
in 1998, were down 1/2 point at 52.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 23/32
compared with 102 13/32 on Wednesday. The latest 10-year
notes ended at 102 9/32 to yield 8.51% compared with 102 4/32
to yield 8.53% on Wednesday.
   Short-term rates were mixed. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.77% for a
bond-equivalent yield 8.02%, slightly higher than Wednesday.
The discount rate on six-month bills ended at 7.65% to yield
8.05%, slightly lower than Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds

   The British government bond market, growing increasingly
volatile, broke a sharp two-day advance yesterday and ended
lower.
   Traders said that prices of British government bonds,
which are called gilts, were higher during early trading. But
they began to slip as investor caution took hold ahead of
today's release of the May current account and trade
deficits. Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report expect, on average, that the current account deficit
-- a broad trade measure -- narrowed to #1.4 billion ($2.41
billion) in May from #1.78 billion in April.
   In trading, Britain's 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell 13/32
to 102 27/32 to yield 11.32%.
   Elsewhere:
   -- West German bond prices ended lower after another day
of listless trading.
   -- Japanese government bonds ended modestly lower as money
market rates rose.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt securities ended narrowly mixed after a
sparsely traded session.
   New-issue activity was also extremely light.
   A $257 million Palm Beach County, Fla., criminal justice
facilities revenue bond issue was tentatively priced to yield
from 6.30% in 1994 to 7.32% in 2011 by a Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. group.
   No new offerings are expected to be priced today.
   In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8 point at 97 3/4 to
yield 7.39%, compared with a 7.35% yield Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Asset-, Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   An abundance of supply and a maturity perceived to be
unpopular were behind the wider yield spread quoted for $1.25
billion Citicorp credit-card securities priced and freed to
trade yesterday.
   That is the view of several traders of asset-backed
securities, who quoted the yield spread on the seven-year
Citicorp securities at 0.91 to 0.92 percentage point above
seven-year Treasurys.
   First Boston Corp. and its affiliate Credit Suisse First
Boston Ltd. were the lead underwriters of the issue.
   The Class A certificates, backed by Visa and MasterCard
credit-card receivables, were priced as 9 3/8% securities at
99.585 to yield 9.456%.
   With this sale, nearly $4 billion of asset-backed
securities have been priced this week. Just over half of
those securities are backed by credit-card receivables.
   Not only is there a supply crunch, but there is said to be
some investor resistance to a seven-year maturity. The
preference is for the shorter maturities that have been seen
in the other offerings earlier in the week.
   In the market for secondary mortgage-backed securities,
Government National Mortgage Association securities for July
delivery were 3/32 firmer at 98 7/8. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were 1/8 firmer at 98 6/32 and
Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were
also up 1/8, at 98 22/32.
