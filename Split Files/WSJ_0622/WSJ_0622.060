   WASHINGTON -- The government nudged up its estimate of
first-quarter economic growth to a 1.9% annual rate from the
1.3% pace it previously reported.
   The revision was primarily due to new information that
showed export growth was far stronger than was estimated in a
report issued last month. The surge in exports was partly
offset, however, by consumer spending that was found to be
weaker than the previous report said.

   Net exports of goods and services rose at an annual rate
of 12.8% in the first quarter, compared with an earlier
projection of 7.7% growth. That was offset by a downward
revision in personal consumption, which grew at a pace of
only 1.6% in the first quarter, rather than 2.4% as projected
in last month's report.
   Although the increase in the nation's real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and
services produced -- was larger than the fourth quarter's
1.1% rate, some economists said they were disappointed by the
latest figures.
   "On the surface this report shows a strong {export}
performance, but it really masks the weakness that is present
in the consumer sector," said Roger Brinner, chief economist
for Data Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass. "What is
important is not only the rate of growth, but also the
composition of growth."
   The Commerce Department report said that after-tax
corporate profits also edged up more than previously
estimated, growing 1.1% in the first quarter to an annual
rate of $158.5 billion. The revision is a clear improvement
over the previous estimate of 0.2%, but is a drastic slowdown
from the fourth quarter increase of 2.8%, the department
said.
   Profits from current production rose 1.3% in the first
quarter, exceeding the government's earlier estimate of 0.7%.
This increase followed three quarters in which profits from
current production fell.
   According to yesterday's report, net corporate cash flow
fell 1.8% in the first quarter, far less than the 2.3%
decline previously estimated by the government.
   All the numbers are adjusted for predictable seasonal
variations.
