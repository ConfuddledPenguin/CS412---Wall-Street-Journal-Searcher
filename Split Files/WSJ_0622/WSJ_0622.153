   Pier 1 Imports Inc. said it achieved record sales and
earnings in its first quarter ended June 2.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, specialty retailer recorded net
income of $7.7 million, up 15% from the $6.7 million reported
in the period ended May 27, 1989. Per-share net, after
payment of preferred dividends, rose to 22 cents from 19
cents a year earlier. Sales increased 22% to $138.4 million
from $113.9 million.

   Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that sales were hurt by bad weather in many consumer
areas and by a softness in demand for furniture and
home-related items. But the company's financial results were
helped by "strong expense control and a successful
inventory-balancing program."
   Pier 1 said it opened 16 new stores during the quarter,
while closing two. The company expects to open 68 more stores
by year end.
