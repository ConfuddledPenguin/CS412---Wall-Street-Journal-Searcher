   Abitibi-Price Inc., a Toronto-based forest products
concern, said it plans to build a US$56 million de-inking
plant at its 50%-owned newsprint mill in Claiborne, Ala.
   Abitibi-Price, 82%-owned by the Reichmann family's closely
held Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., said the plant will
process 125,000 metric tons of wastepaper annually. The
newsprint mill has an annual capacity of 220,000 metric tons
and is scheduled to begin operations next month. A metric ton
is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   The Claiborne newsprint mill, Alabama River Newsprint Co.,
is jointly owned by Abitibi-Price and Parsons &amp; Whittemore
Inc. of New York, a woodpulp maker and builder of pulp and
paper mills. By the end of next year, newsprint made at the
mill will contain as much as 40% recycled paper,
Abitibi-Price said.
   Construction of the de-inking plant, which could begin
next month, is subject to completion of financing agreements
with Alabama River Newsprint's creditors. The Alabama State
Teachers' Retirement Fund agreed in principle to lend US$15
million to the project, Abitibi-Price said.
