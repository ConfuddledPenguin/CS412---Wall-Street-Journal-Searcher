   IT'S SUMMERTIME, but the leaving won't be easy.
   A pair of runway projects, combined with the season's
usual thunderstorms and throngs of travelers, will result in
worsening flight delays and increasingly frustrated fliers,
prognosticators fear.
   Trouble spots, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration, include Cleveland Hopkins airport, where the
main runway, which is equipped with the airport's most
sophisticated instrument landing system, is closed for a
once-a-decade overhaul. "We've taken it on the chin" in foul
weather, groans airport spokesman Mark Courtney. During a
recent hellish week, several pilots had to abort landings,
then try again. Some were diverted to other airports.
   Prepare for delays, too, at Minneapolis-St. Paul, where a
construction project has temporarily shortened an 8,200-foot
runway to 5,600 feet, too short to handle big passenger jets.
   Construction is an excuse that New York airports don't
have. In the five months through May, air-traffic-control
delays surged almost 50% from a year earlier at Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports. And so has fingerpointing. The FAA, which
attributes two-thirds of delays to bad weather, is reviewing
its procedures, but says things would go more smoothly if
airlines moved some flights from peak periods.
   For their part, airlines are complaining to Congress that
the FAA isn't moving aggressively to solve the problem. They
recently got Sen. Frank Lautenberg, (D., N.J.), and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, (R., N.Y.), both on the transportation
appropriations panel, to urge the agency to beef up
controller staffing. One suggestion: temporarily blocking
controllers from transferring out of New York jobs.
   Industry officials speculate that the FAA, stung by
criticism that controllers were juggling too many flights the
night Avianca Flight 52 crashed last January, may become more
conservative, ordering more New York-bound planes held on the
ground at departure airports.
                                                                                                       

   DC-10 Hydraulic Plan
   Doesn't Satisfy Pilots
                                                                                                       

   THE AIR LINE Pilots Association, the main pilots union, is
raising concerns about the "fix" proposed for the McDonnell
Douglas DC-10's hydraulic system in the wake of last July's
crash of a United Airlines jet in Sioux City, Iowa. The
accident, in which 112 people died, occurred after the rear
engine exploded, severing all three hydraulic lines on the
jet and wiping out most flight controls.
   In March, the FAA proposed ordering airlines operating
DC-10s to install shut-off valves developed by the
manufacturer to safeguard against the catastrophic loss of
hydraulic fluid. But the union has doubts. Although the valve
would give a pilot some control over a crippled plane, "we
aren't sure that the airplane will be capable of being flown
to landing," says Harold Marthinson, director of ALPA's
accident investigation department. He concludes: "This is
something that they have ginned up but nobody knows whether
it will really work."
   The union, in a letter to the FAA, says that it would have
preferred that the DC-10 be outfitted with an independent
backup system for flight controls.
   Elayne Bendel, manager of commercial communications for
Douglas Aircraft, a division of McDonnell Douglas, says such
a step is unnecessary because of redundant systems built into
the DC-10. Besides, she says, the proposed modification "has
been flight tested and it works beautifully." The FAA says it
is reviewing ALPA's comments.
                                                                                                       

   Space in Coach to Save
   Lives as Well as Knees
                                                                                                       

   SOLVING a safety problem may pay dividends in comfort for
the squashed airline passenger.
   In recent years, the "pitch" between coach-class seats --
the distance between the back of one and the front of another
-- has shrunk to a measly 21 inches from 34 inches, according
to Richard Livingston, a spokesman for the Airline Passengers
Association of North America. Besides causing leg cramps, the
situation raises serious questions about whether passengers
sitting in window-exit rows have enough room to operate the
bulky exits in a crisis.
   A tragic illustration of the hazard occurred in
Manchester, England, when a British Airways' charter jet
caught fire in 1985, killing 55. Investigators blamed some of
the deaths on the fact that passengers couldn't get out the
window exits fast enough.
   "It's such close quarters . . . that it makes it very
hard" to maneuver the apparatus, Mr. Livingston says. His
group plans to petition the FAA to order airlines to remove
the seat closest to each window exit. The Association of
Flight Attendants has been pressing for some sort of new
safety rule, too.
   But the FAA says it already has plans to direct carriers
to provide more space in rows that have emergency-window
exits. "We are within inches of a final rule on that," says
Anthony Broderick, an FAA official. Removing seats next to
the windows, he says, isn't necessary for safety and would
hurt airline finances. "We think the way to get around it is
to add six or 12 inches or whatever" in space to those rows,
he says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FORTY-THREE percent of Westerners flew at least once last
year, compared with about 33% for other U.S. residents,
according to a Gallup poll conducted for the Air Transport
Association. . . . Almost half of all interstate
highway-pavement is in "fair or poor" condition, the General
Accounting Office says, resulting in a ride that is "barely
tolerable or worse."
