   WASHINGTON -- The Senate, continuing President Bush's
unbroken string of veto victories, failed to override his
veto of legislation that would have eased restrictions on
political activity of federal workers.
   The vote was 65-35 for override, as opponents fell two
votes short of the two-thirds margin that was necessary to
overcome the veto. All 55 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted
to override, while 35 Republicans voted to sustain the veto.

   Last month, the Senate had voted 6730 for the bill, but
three Republicans who voted for the measure then opted to
side with the White House yesterday. They were Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, who was a co-sponsor of the bill; Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New
York.
   The bill would have eased restrictions on off-the-job
political activity by nearly three million federal employees.
Those curbs have existed under the Hatch Act for 51 years,
and labor unions have long pushed to get them relaxed,
contending that government workers should have the same kind
of political rights as other citizens.
   When Mr. Bush vetoed the bill, he said that the Hatch Act
protects workers from harassment, ensuring the integrity and
neutrality of the federal work force. The House voted
Wednesday to override the veto.
   Mr. Bush's victory on the Hatch Act bill brought to 12 the
number of his vetoes Congress has sustained. Lawmakers have
yet to override him.
