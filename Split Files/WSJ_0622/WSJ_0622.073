   McDonald's Corp. and many other fast-food chains are
caught in a vise.
   Squeezing them on one side are casual restaurants that
appeal to aging baby boomers who are losing their appetite
for burgers and fries on the run. These diners are opting for
restaurants that offer a healthier menu, table service and a
more relaxed atmosphere -- at prices not much different from
McDonald's.

   On the other side are the super-discounters, such as
Mexican chains and no-frills hamburger outlets that offer
drive-through service only. These chains are drawing
bargain-hungry fast-food customers who have little brand
loyalty. Low prices and speedy service are their main
demands, with less concern about food quality.
   To maintain customer counts, the big fast-food chains are
cutting prices where necessary while trying to keep up their
service standards. At the same time, they're expanding their
menus to compete with the casual dining establishments. It's
a tricky juggling act.
   Long a ho-hum segment of the $150 billion-a-year
restaurant business, midpriced restaurants too often
symbolized nonchalant waitresses and forgettable food. Today
they boast nutritious-sounding menus and staffs that stress
service.
   As a result, many are experiencing sales gains unseen
elsewhere in the industry. National Restaurant Association
figures show casual dining traffic climbing 8.4% last year
compared with the 1.2% level eked out by quick-service
operators and a 1.4% rise overall.
   Typical of the revival is Perkins Family Restaurants, once
a "cake `n' steak" outfit heavy on pancake breakfasts and
chopped beef dinners. Its something-for-everyone menu now
features sandwiches and salads. Many of its 382 outlets have
bakeries on the premises. Senior citizens can order
small-portion meals at cheaper prices. Kids can eat for
$1.99. And although the restaurants are selling comfort over
speed, they promise free food if lunch isn't served within 10
minutes.
   "We want to attract the person graduating out of fast
food," says Perkins Chairman Donald N. Smith, himself an
alumnus of both Burger King and McDonald's, where he helped
develop McBreakfast. Perkins is a unit of Tennessee
Restaurant Co., Itasca, Ill.
   The average Perkins check runs $4.70 per person. That is
higher than the McDonald's-type tab, but the gap is
shrinking. Since 1986, McDonald's prices have outpaced the
government's Consumer Price Index. Meanwhile, food costs have
declined in recent years; they represented 40% of McDonald's
company-operated outlets' overhead in 1979, but only 34% in
1989.
   "It means that the customer is getting less food for each
dollar spent," says Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst for
San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities. Ticking off a
number of casual dining chains, he says: "You can eat at
Chili's or Denny's or Shoney's for slightly higher prices
than McDonald's -- and in some cases a lower price."
   "Our commitment is to value pricing," a McDonald's
spokesman says, contending that covers speed and accuracy of
service as well as the food. But in broadening the menu from
the original burger, fries and Coke, "it's probably
inevitable that pricing of large sandwiches or entree items
move in the direction of the {sit-down} restaurants."
   By its own count, McDonald's feeds 22 million people a
day, but Barbara Sekowski isn't one of them. "You think you
can take the kids and eat cheaply and you can't anymore. I'd
rather pack my son a sandwich," says the 33-year-old suburban
Chicago sales representative who shuns fast-food outlets.
   Dinner-house operators think they have a good chance of
serving people like Ms. Sekowski, whose generation was weaned
on fast food and now, as it approaches middle age, represents
a growing demographic segment. Ten years ago, 14% of the U.S.
population was between the ages of 30 and 39. Today that
figure is 16.5%. By contrast, the 15- to 29-year-olds -- the
primary fast-food target -- have shrunk a full five points,
to 22.5%.
   The graying of America is likely to favor the casual
dinner house. "Senior citizens, by virtue of their increased
purchasing power, will have more say in menu offerings and
service," says Leslie Steppel, who follows the trade for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   She notes that older people often regard eating out as a
social occasion, and thus are unlikely to meet at a fast-food
restaurant. Still, the chains are trying to bring them in.
Some Florida McDonald's outlets offer Senior Citizen Bingo
during slow morning hours. And the McDonald's spokesman says
the company is experimenting with what he terms "a more
sophisticated dinner ambiance" at some outlets as it seeks to
woo evening-hours patrons.
   In part to broaden their appeal to customers who might
otherwise choose a midpriced restaurant, fast-food
restaurants are offering extensive menu choices. For example,
the McDonald's in Chicago's Northwestern train station food
court sells seven sandwiches, four salads, two soups, 13
beverages and eight desserts. The desserts include four types
of cookies, two of which are fresh-baked. Serving-size
alternatives balloon the options. Besides three sizes of
French fries and Chicken McNuggets orders, various cups make
for 30 drink possibilities.
   Nutritional concerns are also contributing to heftier
menus. McDonald's recently added yogurt, cold cereals and an
apple-bran muffin. It also is working on a grilled chicken
sandwich to rival a popular Burger King item.
   But by offering such an array, fast-food operators are
experiencing service slowdowns at peak hours. More selections
mean a greater burden on the preparation crew. And indecisive
customers can slow down the lines.
   That wide selection, though, may not have much appeal to
another group of customers. "Price is more important to a
heavy fast-food user," says Bob Sandelman, whose Sandelman &amp;
Associates research firm tracks the West Coast quick-service
scene. Speed is nearly as important as price, while food
quality is less so, he says.
   In fact, many drive-through customers seem to buy lunch
much the way they do gasoline; location and price are the
criteria. "They look at it more as a fuel stop than a dining
experience," says Mr. Sandelman. Heavy users tend to be
young, single males.
   PepsiCo Inc. has been able to cash in big on the bargain
hunters. Its Mexican chain, Taco Bell, boosted sales 27% and
earnings 45% last year, and Wall Street is expecting gains
again this year, largely from the chain's 59-cent entrees.
   Wendy's International Inc. is fighting to retain business
by offering low-prices on a "super value menu." McDonald's
resists discounting, seeking to use it only as a local-market
tactic. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly necessary. A
company executive says discounting could account for nearly
18% of McDonald's sales again this year, slightly below the
industry average.
   Mr. Mueller, the Montgomery analyst, suggests that
McDonald's offer "everyday low prices" as retailing giant
Sears does. "That convinces people you're not overpriced on
every item," he says.
   Perhaps fittingly, as McDonald's domestic business slows,
the Oak Brook, Ill., behemoth is increasingly investing in
new restaurants overseas. Not only is American fast food
still a fad in many countries and dining out a special
occasion, but meals often cost substantially more.
   That means McDonald's can realize a fatter return abroad,
where growth potential is tremendous. In the U.S., McDonald's
has 8,400 restaurants serving a population of 250 million.
But in Japan, a country of 140 million, there are only 700
Golden Arches.
