   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it put four big
defense contractors under review for possible downgrades of
its ratings on a total of about $5.9 billion of debt,
continuing the rating concern's examination of that
industrial sector.
   The debt ratings under scrutiny are those for Litton
Industries Inc., with about $1.5 billion in long-term debt;
Lockheed Corp., also with about $1.4 billion in long-term
debt; McDonnell Douglas Corp. and its financial unit, with a
total of about $3 billion in long-term debt; and Raytheon
Co., with about $43 million in long-term debt.

   Moody's said the analysis reflects deteriorating business
prospects for defense contractors. It plans a three-step
review of the industry, said Alfred Pastore, associate
director at Moody's.
   "What we are doing is first looking at the fellows who
make the airplanes and ships, the big-ticket items that are
likely to be affected early on," Mr. Pastore said. Next, he
said, will be a review of electronics and avionics makers,
and finally, a look at major satellite and space systems
makers.
   Moody's plans to study the outlook for specific defense
programs and then consider their effects on individual
companies. Mr. Pastore said the effects of program cuts
aren't expected to be as immediate on electronics and
avionics makers -- or as easily identified.
   Investors yesterday were rocked by one company's woes. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell shares fell $3.75, or 9.5%, to close at $35.75,
after the company on Wednesday announced a retrenchment plan
designed to save $700 million annually in operating expenses.
It is believed that this plan, which was prompted both by
military and civilian products at McDonnell, will lead to the
layoffs of thousands of employees.
   Moody's said the ratings under review are:
   -- Litton's senior debt, rated Baa-1; subordinated debt,
Baa-2; and commercial paper, prime-2.
   -- Lockheed's senior debt, single-A-3; and commercial
paper, prime-2.
   -- McDonnell Douglas's senior debt, Baa-1, and a similar
prospective rating on a shelf registration; subordinated
debt, Baa-2; and commercial paper, prime-2. Also under review
are the McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit's senior debt,
single-A-2, and the same prospective rating on a shelf
registration; subordinated debt, single-A-3; and commercial
paper, prime-1.
   -- Raytheon's senior debt, double-A-2. Moody's said its
prime-1 rating on Raytheon's commercial paper isn't under
review.
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., a spokesman for Litton said that
the company was "highly surprised" by the Moody's
announcement, and that "this is obviously a top-down order to
look at the industry." He added, "We believe that, once they
{Moody's} begin to look at single companies, we will be
swiftly eliminated from the list."
   In Calabasas, Calif., a spokesman for Lockheed said the
company "knows of no basis" for Moody's credit reappraisal.
"On the basis of the current defense budget outlook,
management does not believe that a budget decline will
adversely affect the company's credit quality," he said.
   In St. Louis, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas said the
company is "unique among defense companies," in that it has a
large but currently unprofitable civilian business making
airliners.
   In Lexington, Mass., a spokesman for Raytheon noted that
the company "has the highest current rating of any company"
cited among the four by Moody's for review. He said Raytheon
has "relatively little long-term debt" of about $43 million,
compared with shareholders' equity of $2.5 billion.
   In Big Board trading yesterday, Litton shares closed at
$75.125, down 50 cents; Lockheed shares closed at $35.25,
down 25 cents; and Raytheon shares closed at $64.50, down 25
cents.
   On Wednesday, Moody's downgraded about $670 million of
General Dynamics Corp. debt, citing the slowdown in military
spending and potential major cost overruns on a Navy aircraft
contract. This two-notch downgrade on ratings of General
Dymanics long-term and subordinated debt followed one-notch
reductions earlier this year on securities of McDonnell and
Grumman Corp.
