   MILAN, Italy -- The Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
scored a victory in his battle to regain control of Italy's
largest publisher, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., when an
arbitration board awarded him the right to a contested 25.7%
stake in the parent, AME Finanziaria S.p.A., called AMEF.
   The board ruled that a contract between Mr. De Benedetti
and the Formenton family, providing for the sale of 13.7
million AMEF ordinary shares to Mr. De Benedetti by the end
of 1991, is valid and must be honored. The Formentons said
they would appeal.

   The Formentons' 25.7% interest has played a pivotal role
in the battle with the media baron Silvio Berlusconi for
control of Mondadori, because AMEF controls 50.3% of
Mondadori's ordinary share capital. The Formentons ended
their pact with Mr. De Benedetti late last year to ally
themselves with Mr. Berlusconi, which tipped the power
balance controlling the publishing group and led to Mr.
Berlusconi's appointment as Mondadori president in January.
   The arbitrators's decision, which was expected, was viewed
as a boost to Mr. De Benedetti's ability to negotiate a
settlement to keep the publishing house intact. He rejected a
proposal by Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest S.p.A. earlier this
week to split Mondadori into two separately controlled units.
   With the Formenton package, Mr. De Benedetti's AMEF stake
will be lifted to 52.65%, while his control of Mondadori's
total share capital will rise to 78.5% from 51.3%. His
holding company, Cie. Industriale Riunite S.p.A., already
owns 26.9% of AMEF; Fininvest holds 40%. Fininvest holds 13%
of Mondadori's total share capital, while minority holders
own the remainder.
