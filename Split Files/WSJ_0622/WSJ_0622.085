   OTTAWA -- Canadian retail sales fell 1% in April from
March, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The agency said retail sales have fluctuated "markedly" in
the first four months of the year, registering "marginal
overall growth." In March, retail sales rose 0.3%.

   The April decline was attributed partly to a drop in sales
of autos and other vehicles.
