   Hanson Industries, the U.S. unit of Hanson PLC of the
U.K., said it completed arrangements for $2.6 billion in new
bank financing with a banking group led by Chemical Bank.
   The financing will be used to complete the acquisition of
Peabody Holding Co., a large U.S. coal producer, and to
refinance Hanson's bank debt.

   In April, Hanson acquired 45% of Peabody for $504 million
and later bid $715 million to purchase the remainder of the
company from Newmont Mining Corp. A move by Amax Inc. to top
the bid was quickly countered by Hanson with a new price of
$725.6 million. The remaining Peabody shares will be closed
to new bidders after June 25, and Newmont holders are to vote
on the sale June 27; the acquisition is expected to be
completed within five days of the vote.
   Hanson has interests in tobacco, specialty chemicals,
building products and mining, including a 49% stake in
Denver-based Newmont.
