   MANAGUA -- A common perception about Nicaragua is that its
newly installed government is weak, divided and confused,
while the Sandinistas, who still control the armed forces and
grass-roots organizations, are "governing from below," as
expresident Daniel Ortega predicted. The future, therefore,
looks bleak, and only the most optimistic hope that President
Violeta Chamorro will overcome the more experienced and far
better organized Sandinista Front, which is blocking her
every move with strikes and sabotage.
   There is no doubt that the Chamorro government is weak.
Analysts are right to point out that it presides over a
bankrupt economy. Economic advisers still are at odds over
the proper methods of implementing economic reforms. The
government hardly has any military or enforcement power. It
often lacks coherence and sophistication. But analysts keep
missing a crucial point: The Sandinistas, despite their
weapons, their national and international networks, and their
still vociferous militants, are -- and have been -- a largely
artificial force that can survive and thrive only through the
enforced monopoly of state power.

   Sandinista loyalists now are denied free gas, vehicles,
buildings and other privileges. The Sandinista Confederation
of Labor (CST) owns a large building in Managua that the
"comandantes" confiscated and converted into party property.
But now they have to pay electric bills, taxes and
maintenance out of their own pockets. Sandinistas are
beginning to realize how expensive a party can be once it has
to support itself without state resources.
   When they allowed an opening -- through elections, however
stacked in their favor -- the Sandinistas suffered a dramatic
political defeat. Now, deprived of the state as the party's
instrument of coercion, reward and funding, the Sandinistas
may be on the way toward political oblivion.
   I witnessed one of these reverses in the Ministry of
Education, where I work, affecting the Sandinistas' union of
teachers, called Anden. Like all other Sandinista
organizations, Anden was forced on the workers. It had been
supported by a combination of outright state subsidies and by
the enforcement of an automatic deduction from state employee
paychecks. Each month, Anden collected 1% of the payroll of
our 31,900 employees. Teachers recently were told that from
now on, membership in labor unions, including Anden, was to
be freely decided by employees. Carried out at all government
levels, this policy is dealing a mortal blow to the
Sandinista labor movement.
   For the first time Sandinista activities have to compete
for resources with the democratic unions. Thousands of
employees are leaving unions that the comandantes created and
imposed from above. The process is fueled by the bitter
memories of Sandinista edicts that strikes and demands for
raises were considered treasonous. And in most state-owned
factories or institutions independent labor unions were
severely harassed, if not banned outright. Now, the
democratic unions are fully legal and growing, while the
Sandinista ones are shrinking. On April 27, two days after
Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration, 5,000 of the 7,000 employees at
the huge, state-owned sugar mill -- San Antonio -- met at a
baseball stadium and voted overwhelmingly to leave the
Sandinista union and join the CTN, an independent union.
   The FSLN, the Sandinista Party, in fact is rich in
property and installations; before leaving office its leaders
outfitted their party at the expense of the national
treasury. They now own two newspapers, several radio
stations, countless buildings, many businesses, cars, trucks,
giant loudspeaker systems and the like. But they are hard
pressed to pay for operating costs. Though their finances --
as always -- are secret, every indication suggests they
already are in the red. When their loudspeaker system needs a
part, no longer can they charge the expense to the Ministry
of Culture, nor can they exempt themselves from import taxes.
   Slowly but steadily, the new government has been replacing
Sandinista militants in the state apparatus by members the
new authorities can trust. In the Education Ministry, we have
fired both national and regional directors appointed by the
former regime. The substantive impact this has had on
education already is being felt. No longer is the Sandinista
anthem sung in the nation's classrooms; the Nicaraguan
national anthem is sung instead. Next semester textbooks
infused with Sandinista doctrine will be replaced; for now
the ideological parts are skipped over, and we teach civic
education in their place.
   At times, the mobilization of Sandinista militants has
been able to block the removal of some of their members from
government posts. But newly appointed administrators simply
withhold from these managers decision-making power and even
their normal duties. Such circumstances have led numerous
Sandinista militants to resign from state jobs. For example,
20 top managers at the Ministry of Social Welfare, all
Sandinista militants, recently resigned (which also says
something about Sandinista practices of overstaffing in this
impoverished nation of three million).
   But in various government institutions there is a growing
willingness of old employees to cooperate with the new
authorities, even among many supporters of the past regime.
They are conforming to the country's new direction.
   As it slowly democratizes Nicaragua, the new government
gains ground. Ordinary citizens already have been granted far
greater room for initiative and freedom of action in all
realms. For example, the Education Ministry has just
eliminated all the red tape and cumbersome requirements that
Nicaraguans had to meet in order to establish private schools
of commerce, crafts, skills and other trades. We are letting
the market -- not the state -- pass final judgment on the
worth of different educational establishments.
   We also plan to relax the very detailed curriculum
requirements that currently are imposed on all schools,
inhibiting creativity and independence within the educational
community. Under the Sandinistas there was only one textbook
for every class. Even private schools had to follow it,
together with minute regulations on how and when to go from
one unit to the next. Now we will allow the use of many
textbooks and make the programs less constraining.
   At the economic and social levels both small and big
producers are celebrating the new freedom of the marketplace.
Small retailers are free to buy or sell the quantities and
qualities they want for nearly all products. In the past they
were closely controlled by Enabas, a giant state corporation
that ruined numerous small shops through excessive taxation
and cumbersome trade restrictions.
   The Sandinistas in the meantime still can make much noise.
They are entrenched at the National University, where they
enjoy nearly absolute control under an autonomy law that they
granted themselves, following their electoral defeat. The
poignant fact, however, is that the Sandinistas are back to
where they came from: the sub-culture of the university
elites bent on promoting utopias that have no roots in the
yearnings of the common man.
