   NEW YORK -- Manhattan, inc. and M magazine, battered by
losses and an industrywide advertising slump, are banding
together in an unusual merger to form a new magazine dubbed M
inc.
   Financial terms of the merger weren't disclosed, but the
new magazine will be owned by M publisher Fairchild
Publications, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.; it will
target affluent male readers, something both magazines have
done with only limited success.

   D. Herbert Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, publisher of
Manhattan, inc., will be president of M inc, and will retain
what he called a "significant" interest. Clay Felker, a
veteran magazine editor who is editor of Manhattan, inc., has
been given the title of editor-at-large. He will work on
developing the new magazine under Jane F. Lane, who will be
the new editor of M inc. Ms. Lane had been editor in chief of
M.
   Magazine mergers are rare, and this one was greeted with
skepticism by advertising agency executives. "It sounds weird
to me," said Valerie Muller, media director of Pedone &amp;
Partners agency. "Neither has had tremendous success. Just
how many readers from each magazine will follow the new one?"
   Advertising executives also noted that M inc is just the
latest entry in a rush of new men's general interest
magazines. "There is a lot of attention now on the male
reader, but there is no research yet to show that real reader
support is there," said Paul DuCharme, media director at Grey
Advertising. "This is not a marriage made in heaven."
   Mr. Lipson said the new magazine will combine both "the
life-style features of M and the business orientation of
Manhattan, inc." Both companies claim the new magazine will
deliver the "best upscale male demographics in publishing
today." The average income of the M magazine reader is
$138,000; of Manhattan, inc., $226,000.
   "If we do this thing right, maybe we can kickstart the new
magazine," added Phillip J. Meek, president of Fairchild
Publications.
   But M inc represents a marriage of publishing also-rans.
Neither magazine is profitable, and both have suffered steady
declines in advertising pages for more than a year. M,
launched by Fairchild in 1983, is largely a fashion and
life-style magazine that has been a perennial third behind
Hearst Corp.'s Esquire, and Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s
GQ. M's circulation is currently about 152,000.
   Manhattan, inc. was launched by the Philadelphia-based
Metrocorp in 1984; it was considered a promising, savvy new
magazine under its founding editor Jane Amsterdam. But after
her departure, which followed disputes with Mr. Lipson,
Manhattan, inc. has steadily lost advertising since 1987. Its
circulation has risen to more than 110,000, due largely to
direct mail campaigns offering the magazine at cut-rate
subscription prices.
   Manhattan, inc. won't publish an August issue. Fairchild
will introduce the first combined issue in September with a
guaranteed circulation base to advertisers of 200,000.
   The merger follows rumors that Mr. Lipson would be faced
with closing down the money-losing Manhattan, inc. "I have
lost a lot of money on Manhattan, inc.," Mr. Lipson
acknowledged, adding that he had been seeking an investor.
   Industry experts estimate Mr. Lipson has lost as much as
$10 million on the magazine in recent years. The merger
doesn't affect Mr. Lipson's other Metrocorp properties, the
profitable Boston and Philadelphia city magazines.
   While M inc was portrayed by executives from both
companies as an equal merging of the magazines' staff and
editorial content, it appears to be weighted heavily toward
Fairchild's M. Michael F. Coady, Fairchild senior vice
president, said details of merging the sales and editorial
staffs are still being worked out, but sources close to the
magazines said the Manhattan, inc. editorial staff of about
27 would be cut in half.
   One of M inc's competitors is being started by a
Manhattan, inc. editor. Peter W. Kaplan, editorial director
of Manhattan, inc. will be the editor of Men, a new magazine
from Norris Publishing scheduled to debut by the end of this
year.
