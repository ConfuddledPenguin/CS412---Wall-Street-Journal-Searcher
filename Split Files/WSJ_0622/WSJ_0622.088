   In addition, the aluminum producer said orders and prices
began to turn up at the end of the first quarter. "We should
see improvement in our second quarter report," the company
said. It wasn't more specific.
   In the 1989 second quarter the company had net income of
$150.7 million, or $2.55 a share, on revenue of $1.68
billion.
   The company said 1992 pretax earnings would rise about
$200 million as a result of capital expenditures.
   "We are investing more in this company now than at any
time in our history," the company said. In the current year
Reynolds Metals will spend about $900 million on capital
projects, up from the annual average of about $700 million
spent over the past three years, the company said.
