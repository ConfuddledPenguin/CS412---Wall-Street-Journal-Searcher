   TOKYO -- Considering the continuing strength of Japanese
domestic demand amid continued worries about the so-called
triple demerits of weaker currency, bond and stock markets,
Japan's economic growth will slow to a 4.6% pace in the year
ending March 31, Cosmo Securities Co.'s research unit
predicted.
   Recently released Japanese gross national product data
showed 5% growth in fiscal 1990, with little evidence of
damage from the triple demerits, the research group said, but
as these factors continue into the current fiscal year,
economic growth is likely to cool.

   More diversified demand, with a greater desire for luxury
goods, will remain an underlying support for personal
consumption, seen growing at a 4.4% pace in fiscal 1991, the
unit said. Also, housing being constructed will probably
decrease slightly, but higher costs from increased value will
offset the slowdown.
