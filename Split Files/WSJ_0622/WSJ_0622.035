   MADRID -- In a crowded tax office, bundles of paper tied
up with red tape fill a row of shelves against a wall. "Last
year's income tax returns," says Juan Miguel Lopez de Veraza,
the office supervisor. "We still haven't finished dealing
with them. Goodness knows where we'll put this year's batch."
   Behind him, a line of people waiting to make 1989 income
tax declarations stretches into the street. As the June 20
deadline neared, the scene in the Hortaleza district tax
office illustrated the government's success in widening its
tax net.

   But it also underlined one of Spain's principal
shortcomings: cumbersome bureaucracy. Paying taxes may mean
"investing in Spain," as government-financed billboards on
Spanish highways proclaim, but up-front conditions are
onerous. This office in suburban Madrid is open to the public
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday to Friday. Until Mr. Lopez de
Veraza put a stop to it recently, employees used to take
"coffee breaks" to go shopping during office hours. Even when
they're on duty, taxpayers may have to wait in line for
hours.
   Now, the government has embarked on an overhaul of Spain's
tax system that could help reduce some of the queues. Income
taxes are expected to be lowered slightly, and indirect taxes
increased. But the changes aren't a change of heart on the
part of Spain's Socialist government. Rather, they are being
forced on it by future freedom for capital movements in the
European Community. If Spanish income taxes are higher than
those in other EC countries, Spain could face a big outflow
of funds. Some savvy Spaniards are already moving their
fiscal residence abroad.
   Until now, in a nation where tax dodging is something of a
national pastime, Spanish fiscal policy has relied more on
sticks than on carrots. A top marginal income tax rate of 56%
starts on taxable incomes above 8,240,000 pesetas ($79,000).
Wealth tax starts at 0.2% on taxable assets above nine
million pesetas, rising to 2% above 2.5 billion pesetas. The
principle of progressively increasing taxation of incomes is
enshrined in the constitution. The only safeguard is a clause
stipulating that total taxes under both headings can't exceed
70% of an individual's annual income.
   Faced with widespread tax evasion, the government has done
its best to enforce the rules. In the past few years, it has
doubled the number of tax inspectors and uncovered
large-scale tax frauds, for example, in single-premium life
insurance policies.
   In Spain's property market, it has taken steps to prevent
the underdeclaration of sales values by saying it will tax
any difference between sales prices and market values as a
gift. It has announced plans for special taxes on real estate
bought through offshore companies under a system used by
non-residents and even some Spaniards to avoid Spanish taxes.
   Later this year, Spaniards will be issued with fiscal
identity cards, the use of which will be obligatory in all
sorts of transactions from opening a bank account to buying a
house. Due largely to successful tax policing, the government
hopes to eliminate its budget deficit in 1992.
   What it hasn't succeeded in doing, however, is to
establish a consensus that taxes are fair. Wealthy Spaniards
complain that they're being taxed too much, while labor
unions allege that many high earners don't declare as much as
they should.
   Last year, the constitutional court forced the
government's hand by ruling that a system for taxing married
couples was unfair. Couples were being charged on their
combined income at the same marginal rates as applied to
individuals. The result of the court's ruling was a
five-month delay in tax declarations while the government
amended the law. The change finally saved couples around 300
billion pesetas in income tax.
   Now, in an effort to win support for future tax policy,
the government has consulted economists and labor unions and
plans to open talks soon with employers. On Friday, a cabinet
meeting spent several hours discussing the issue. Officials
say they hope to get draft legislation ready to present to
Parliament next month.
   But the planned changes, though going some way toward
making Spain's tax system simpler, aren't expected to amount
to a tax revolution. The principle of progressive taxation
will be maintained, officials say. Though red tape will be
reduced in some areas, it's likely to be increased in others,
they admit.
   Income taxes are expected to be lowered slightly, for both
high and modest incomes. Top marginal income tax rates may be
reduced, either by cutting the top rate a few points or by
raising the threshold at which it comes into effect.
   Capital gains, at present taxed as income, are expected to
be treated more favorably, particularly for long-term
investments. They won't be taxed at all in cases where the
initial investment is below a specified limit. Total revenue
from income taxes is likely to fall 5% to 12%.
   But the reduction in revenues will be compensated for by
higher value-added taxes and excise taxes. The ordinary VAT
rate is expected to rise from 12% to 14% or more. A luxury
VAT rate of 33% is expected sooner or later to be reduced to
match the ordinary rate. In the case of cars, the difference
will probably be made up for by a registration fee.
