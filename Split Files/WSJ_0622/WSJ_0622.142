   Henley Properties Inc., Hampton, N.H., said it expects
second-quarter net income of about $80 million, or $3.83 a
share, compared with a pro forma $4.8 million, or 23 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   The real estate holding company also said it expects to
report shareholders' net equity of $230 million at the end of
the quarter, up from $145 million on a pro forma basis a year
earlier. Henley Properties was spun off from Henley Group
Inc., also based in Hampton, last December.

   Both the earnings and equity gains result mainly from
accounting adjustments involving two trash-to-energy plants
owned by Henley Properties and operated by Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. under a sale and lease-back arrangement.
Henley Properties said it expects to sell the plants for $10
million to Wheelabrator this month. Thus, about $100 million
of deferred income treated as a liability on Henley
Properties' balance sheet will be eliminated, boosting net
equity. Wheelabrator said the deal isn't expected materially
to affect its second-quarter results or balance sheet.
