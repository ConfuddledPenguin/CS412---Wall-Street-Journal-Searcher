   NEW YORK -- The sparsely followed oil refining and
marketing industry is gaining converts on Wall Street, where
some say it is one of the few undervalued sectors left in the
market.
   The enthusiasm isn't confined to analysts who recommend
refining stocks as a quick in-and-out "trading" play. There
are plenty of these short-term bulls, who are looking for
fatter profit margins in the next few months. Refining
profits often swing wildly with the price of crude oil and
the demand for refined products such as gasoline and heating
oil.

   But now there's a longer-term case for the stocks as well
-- even though Wall Street has long regarded refiners as a
short-term sideshow to the "integrated" oil giants such as
Exxon and Mobil.
   One money manager with a good track record in energy
stocks is buying refining-company shares with an eye to the
long-term value of oil refineries and the storage and
pipeline networks that surround them.
   The theory is that environmental restrictions, building
costs and local political opposition make it just about
impossible to put in a new oil refinery in the U.S. today. As
a result, old refineries -- even ones that have to be
upgraded to meet new environmental rules -- will become more
valuable.
   "You cannot build a refinery facility in this country from
the ground up any more," says Alan Gaines, president of
Gaines, Berland Inc., a money management and institutional
stock brokerage firm specializing in energy issues. "Even if
you could, the cost of construction runs between $10,000 and
$12,000 per barrel of daily throughput capacity." (Refinery
capacity is usually defined by the number of barrels of crude
oil a plant can process daily.)
   By those estimates, a typical 100,000 barrel-a-day
refinery would cost $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Mr. Gaines
says a refiner would need profit margins of $12 to $14 a
barrel to make the facility pay; current refining margins are
about $8 a barrel.
   Mr. Gaines, a former energy analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's,
expects prices paid for refinery properties to escalate in
the next few years, boosting refiners' shares. Recently,
refineries have sold for as little as $2,000 per barrel of
daily capacity -- for plants that were badly located or had
limited prospects for upgrading -- and for as much as $6,000
per barrel of capacity.
   The integrated oil companies, which find as well as refine
oil, "will buy refineries rather than build them," Mr. Gaines
says. "There is scarcity value in the independent refiners."
The scarcity is especially acute in the case of storage
facilities and pipelines to big urban markets. "The
infrastructure is not up to the job, and it's tough to get
permits to build," he says. "That's why I think refining will
be a phenomenal business in this decade."
   Mr. Gaines's stock picks include four independent oil
refiners and marketers, which he began accumulating as long
as two years ago. A more recent addition is Salomon, which
owns four oil refineries in addition to a securities firm.
The four picks:
   Crown Central Petroleum, whose Class B shares closed at 32
1/4 yesterday, down 5/8 in American Stock Exchange composite
trading, is "undoubtedly the most undervalued of the four on
an asset basis," says Mr. Gaines.
   He contends that the company's refineries and its network
of gasoline stations are worth "in excess of $100 a share."
   Diamond Shamrock, which fell 1/4 to 25 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, is worth $42 to $45 a share, Mr.
Gaines says, considering its upgraded refineries and the
quality of its management.
   Horsham, which bought an oil company out of bankruptcy
proceedings in 1988 and owns 22.5% of American Barrick
Resources, a gold producer, is worth between $13.50 and $14 a
share, he says. The stock closed at 8 1/2 yesterday, up 1/8,
in Big Board trading.
   Ashland Oil, which last week was ordered to pay $10.3
million in damages to neighbors of its refinery in
Catlettsburg, Ky., is undergoing a restructuring, Mr. Gaines
says. The company has been shedding its construction and
engineering business to focus on refining, marketing and
chemicals. The stock, which dropped 1/4 to 36 1/4 on the Big
Board yesterday, could be worth $65 a share in two to four
years, Mr. Gaines says.
   "All of these stocks in three years will approach
asset-transfer values," Mr. Gaines says.
   He isn't the only one of Wall Street's oil followers who
are fond of refiners these days. But the rest tend to suggest
playing them for the short term. Goldman Sachs, for example,
is recommending Ashland, Valero, Diamond Shamrock and Sun Co.
because it expects refining profit margins to be high for the
next few months. Mabon Nugent is recommending Sun, Valero and
Ashland for similar reasons; Prudential-Bache Securities is
bullish on Sun as a refining play.
   One respected oil analyst, William Brown III of Kidder
Peabody, last week headed in the opposite direction, saying
refining margins had peaked and downgrading Ashland to "hold"
from "buy."
   In Mr. Brown's view, Mr. Gaines's argument that refining
capacity will become scarce fails to account for older, idle
refineries in the Caribbean that could be put back into
service if gasoline demand -- which has been declining --
starts to rise.
   Mr. Gaines, who made money by betting on price declines at
several refining companies in the mid-1980s, argues that the
Caribbean refineries are too outmoded to be restarted
economically.
