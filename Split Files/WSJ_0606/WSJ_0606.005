   LONDON -- A specter is haunting Europe -- the specter of
anti-communism. But in the city where Karl Marx crafted "Das
Kapital" at a desk in the British Library, reds are anything
but dead.
   At a radical bookshop in London, Fergus Nicol sorts a
magazine rack crowded with Trotskyist tabloids, a Maoist
monthly and an African quarterly headlined "Arise Ghanaians]"
The shop's hottest periodical, Class War, is gone.

   "Sells out as soon as it comes in," says Mr. Nicol.
"Delivery's a bit erratic. They're anarchists."
   Turning to a table labeled BookMarx Club, Mr. Nicol offers
an alternative: "Class Struggles in Ancient Greece," the only
remaining selection from the club's spring list. "Judging
from sales," he says, "one would think this was Russia,
1917."
   On the British left, you don't need a bookman to know
which way the wind blows. Fringe groups like the Socialist
Workers Party are recruiting more new members than at any
other time in 20 years. In March, anarchist cells called
Class War and Crowbar stormed police barricades in the worst
riot in London this century, resulting in 133 injuries and
341 arrests. And Britain's Labor Party, home to many
socialists, leads Margaret Thatcher's Tories by about 15
points in opinion polls.
   Prime Minister Thatcher helped spark this revolt by
replacing property taxes with a per-head "poll tax" that
taxes dukes and gravediggers at the same rate. But there's
tradition at work here, too. England has a proud history of
radical and often eccentric dissent, from the anti-royal
Levelers of the 17th century, to the machine-smashing
Luddites of the 19th, to the Cambridge-bred communism of Kim
Philby and other Soviet spies in the 20th.
   Tony Benn, a leading left-winger in Parliament, notes that
the Peasants Revolt of 1381 also was sparked by a poll tax.
"Back then," he says, "it was lords against vassals. Now it's
Thatcher against working people. This is still a feudal
society."
   Pitchfork-wielding peasants might have trouble recognizing
some of today's agitators as kin. At a boarded-up building in
the tough London district of Brixton, the sign on the door
says "Poll Tax Free Zone," but the topic of a meeting inside
is "Anarchy and Sexuality." A young man with a shaved head
and a safety pin through his ear begins, "We know the family
is the main organ of oppression in society. But what can we
do?" A woman in denim and studded leather knows: "Empower
five-year-olds to rebel against their parents."
   In 15 minutes, a hint of anarchy surfaces. A woman
suggests that the 10-person group split into smaller cells,
"because some people are dominating." The man with the shaved
head wants to discuss "concentration camps for homosexuals in
Cuba." A woman snaps back: "Why pick on Cuba? What about the
slave labor camps here?"
   Debate such as this has earned British radicals the
sobriquet "loony left," with the Labor Party its traditional
asylum. In the mid-1980s, London's Labor-run education
authority proposed banning competitive sports, and introduced
math tests requiring students to draw graphs of U.S. arms
spending.
   A few years ago, two nursery-school teachers in a
Labor-run district, on their own initiative, rebuked a boy
for reciting "Baa Baa Black Sheep" on the ground it was
"racially derogatory." More recently, an anti-imperialist
group with broad Labor support, called Liberation, has
championed Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   "I like his approach to the struggle for liberty and
justice in the world," says Liberation's general secretary,
Tony Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert recently went to Tripoli to help
decide this year's winner of a $200,000 "Gadhafi Human Rights
Prize." It went to the children of the Palestinian uprising.
   Eager to moderate its image, Labor now is jettisoning many
hard-line policies and expelling leftist zealots from its
ranks. Some disaffected Laborites are turning to extremist
groups.
   At a weekend anti-poll-tax rally spearheaded by the
Militant Tendency, a Trotskyist faction, Mrs. Thatcher hangs
in effigy from a tree in a London shopping district. Standing
on a bench, Lois Austin, a supermarket worker, shouts at a
crowd of about 100: "Why should I pay the same tax as some
yuppie millionaire who parks his Mercedes at the fancy end of
my street?" A rally organizer tosses a match into a trash
bin, and the crowd moves forward to ignite their poll-tax
bills. Someone cuts the prime minister down and tosses her
onto the bonfire, chanting, "Maggie] Maggie] Maggie] Out]
Out] Out]"
   Standing at the edge of the crowd is construction worker
Maurice Carter. He has skulls tatooed on his biceps and a
disdainful smirk on his face. "These groups are just pimples
on the government's arse," he says. "They should burn down
Parliament is what they should do."
   Mr. Carter supports Class War, one of several groups
accused of inciting a riot in March. Demonstrators smashed
windows, looted, and skirmished with police to protest the
poll tax, which is also known as the community charge. Class
War welcomed the notoriety. According to its paper, "A
community charge means running down a street with a brick in
your hand and a pig in your sights]"
   Other tactics include smashing Jaguars with sledgehammers
-- "Bash the Rich]" being a favorite slogan -- and mocking
the royal family. When the Duchess of York recently gave
birth to her second child, Class War noted with "deep regret"
the arrival of "another royal parasite."
   Recent events from Berlin to Bucharest have led to curious
contortions on the left. Most groups are disclaiming any
association with the East bloc. The Socialist Workers Party
claims the late East bloc regimes in fact represented "state
capitalism." The Militant says they were Stalinist. "We
predicted all along that the workers would rise up against
bureaucratic tyranny," says Militant spokesman Ken Smith. As
for those workers' new enthusiasm for capitalism, he adds:
"Working-class consciousness doesn't develop in a straight
line. Before long, they'll realize they've been conned, just
like workers in Britain."
   It's not clear, though, that the British masses are about
to throw off their chains. At a packed meeting of the
Socialist Workers Party at the Birdcage Pub in London's
gritty East End, the audience cheers loudly when a speaker
calls the Tories "greedy, naked capitalists." But a look at
the meeting's attendance list suggests more students than
proletarians.
   The bar downstairs, meanwhile, is filled with men shooting
pool and throwing darts. "It's the same every month," says
Colin Cannon, a retired clerical worker. "Socialists shouting
upstairs, and workers down here drinking beer."
   It's enough to make one committed Communist roll over in
his grave. At a Victorian cemetery in north London, where
Karl Marx was buried in 1883, an imposing bust of the German
philosopher rises above a tomb whose inscription reads:
"Workers of All Lands Unite."
   As of June 1, workers have had to pony up a pound to pay
their respects. Jean Pateman, of Friends of Highgate
Cemetery, a group of women who tend the graveyard, says the
fee will help keep undesirables out of the cemetery, or, as
she puts it, the "people in running shorts who swill lager
and shout vulgarities."
   Events in Eastern Europe haven't kept pilgrims away from
the grave, with the possible exception of one. For four
years, the most frequent visitor was an alley cat --
ginger-colored, of course -- whose deceased owner had been a
devoted Marxist. The women at the cemetery took to feeding
the cat, naming him Engels.
   Earlier this year, amid the tumult in Eastern Europe,
Engels vanished. Hildegard Kenwrick-Cox, who often fed him,
has a theory as to why. "Cats are smarter than people," she
says. "They know when to give up on a lost cause."
