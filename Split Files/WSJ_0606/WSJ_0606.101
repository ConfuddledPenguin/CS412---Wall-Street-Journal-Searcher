   AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. said John N. Lauer was
elected chief operating officer and will become president
when Leigh Carter retires on Sept. 1.
   The move makes Mr. Lauer, 51 years old, a likely candidate
to succeed John D. Ong as chairman and chief executive
officer of the plastics, specialty chemicals and aerospace
concern. But because Mr. Ong is 56, any succession appears to
be some years away.

   Mr. Lauer joined Goodrich as executive vice president on
Jan. 1, 1989, from Hoechst Celanese, the U.S. unit of Hoechst
AG of West Germany, for which he was responsible for
engineered plastics operations.
   Mr. Lauer was hired by Goodrich with the understanding
that he would succeed Mr. Carter, who is 64, as president and
chief operating officer. He was elected to the Goodrich board
last September.
   Mr. Carter was president and chief executive of Tremco
Inc., a Cleveland-based producer of sealants and other
specialty chemical products, when Tremco was acquired by
Goodrich in 1979. He was elected an executive vice president
of Goodrich in 1982, vice chairman in 1984, and president and
operating chief in 1986.
   He helped complete the lengthy transformation of Goodrich
from a maker of tires and industrial rubber products into a
company that gets about half of its $2.4 billion in annual
revenue from polyvinyl chloride plastics and related
products, slightly more than 30% from specialty chemicals,
and nearly 20% from aircraft brakes and other aerospace
products and services.
