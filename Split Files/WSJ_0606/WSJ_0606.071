   New Jersey's highest court struck down the state's system
of financing public schools, ruling that the system doesn't
provide enough money for schools in poorer, urban districts.
   The court's concern, shared by a number of other state
supreme courts, is that property tax-based financing of
school systems tends to result in greater school funding in
wealthier districts.

   Despite financing changes mandated by the court in 1975,
the New Jersey court said the system still produces
disparities among school districts and thus violates the
state's constitutional guarantee of a "thorough and
efficient" education. The court ordered that the state devise
a plan to guarantee equal funding among districts by the
beginning of the 1991-1992 school year. However, the court
said implementation of the plan may be phased in over an
unspecified period of years.
   In recent years, courts have rejected school financing
procedures in Texas, Kentucky, Kansas, Wisconsin, California,
Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and
Montana.
   The New Jersey decision comes only a week after New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio released a $1.2 billion proposal that would
increase state assistance to poorer school districts by
raising the state income tax for wealthy residents and
reducing the share of the state budget allocated to more
affluent districts.
   But lawyers and education finance experts say the New
Jersey decision is especially far-reaching -- perhaps more so
than the governor's plan. Rather than requiring a minimum
level of resources for poorer districts, the opinion calls
for the state to guarantee the same level of resources in all
districts. As a result, New Jersey could be forced to raise
budget allocations for poorer schools each time wealthy
districts independently increase their expenditures.
   Instead of allowing a restructuring of the current state
educational budget, the court "is essentially telling the
government you must increase expenditures for education,"
said Eric Neisser, a professor at Rutgers University law
school in Newark. The opinion estimates that the remedies
called for in the opinion may cost the state about $440
million annually. This comes as the state faces financially
difficult times; its deficit, currently at $600 million this
year, is projected to reach as much as $2 billion next year
if new taxes and budget cuts aren't approved.
   Mr. Neisser said the opinion requires the state to do more
for inner-city schools than Gov. Florio had proposed, given
that the governor's plan established only a minimum
expenditure requirement for each student in the state. But a
spokeswoman for the governor disagreed, saying the Florio
plan "goes far beyond what the state has outlined."
   Gov. Florio supported the position of the plaintiffs in
the case, 20 school-age children from four New Jersey cities.
The administration of his predecessor, Thomas Kean, defended
the current financing system. A spokeswoman for the New
Jersey attorney general's office said that U.S. Supreme Court
review of the case can't be sought because there are no
issues of federal law in the case.
   Meanwhile, in response to a similar ruling by the Texas
Supreme Court last fall, the Texas state Senate yesterday
approved a $528 million plan to increase funds available to
poor districts. If the plan is approved by the House, as
expected, it would be financed by an increase in the state
sales tax and tobacco levies. Texas Gov. Bill Clements agreed
to the plan last week, after vetoing two previous school
finance reform packages that called for higher sales tax
increases.
   The New Jersey decision reflects "the inclination on the
part of a growing number of state courts" to find a state
constitutional basis for changing the way states pay for
public education, said Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard
Law School. In a landmark 1976 decision, the U.S. Supreme
Court said that the equal protection clause of the federal
constitution does not provide grounds for requiring that
public school financing be restructured.
   A 1975 decision by the New Jersey state court relied on
that state's constitution to require the legislature to
restructure its education financing system, and in 1976 the
court approved the legislature's plan to increase funding for
poor districts by raising the state income tax. However, the
school systems still rely significantly on local property
taxes.
   In its decision yesterday, the court said that the 1976
plan did not work as intended, pointing out that disparities
between resource levels at rich and poor districts have
widened since the mid-1970s.
