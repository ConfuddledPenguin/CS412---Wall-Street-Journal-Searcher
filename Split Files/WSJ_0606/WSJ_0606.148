   WASHINGTON -- Senate proponents of an omnibus anti-crime
bill failed to limit debate on the legislation, which could
end up being buried under a mountain of proposed amendments.
   The vote was 54-37 to restrict further debate to 30 hours,
but under Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to impose the
limit. Democratic proponents of the bill are expected to try
again to limit debate in a vote scheduled for tomorrow
morning.

   Yesterday's vote was a short-term victory for opponents of
gun control, who failed last week to defeat a provision that
would impose a three-year ban on nine types of semi-automatic
"assault" weapons. If cloture isn't achieved, debate on more
than 240 pending amendments could last for weeks, forcing the
Senate's Democratic leadership to pull the omnibus bill.
   Democratic staff members said the party's leadership
believes that cloture "is within reach," noting that nine
senators didn't vote yesterday and that several others may be
persuaded to switch their votes.
