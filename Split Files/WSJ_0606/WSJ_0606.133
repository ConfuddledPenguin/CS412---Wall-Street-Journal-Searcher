   Horizon Healthcare Corp. said it refinanced about $20
million in mortgages and an $8 million working-capital loan
with a new lead lender at lower interest rates.
   The Albuquerque, N.M.-based owner of nursing homes and
retirement facilities said its new mortgage and credit
agreement is led by HomeFed Bank of San Diego and carries an
interest rate 1 1/2 percentage points above the prime rate.

   Previously, the company said it had about $4.4 million in
mortgages and a working-capital loan of about $8 million with
banks led by First National Bank of Boston. The
working-capital loan carried an interest rate of 3 1/2 points
above prime.
   The company said it will use additional cash from
refinancing the mortgages to reduce its payables.
