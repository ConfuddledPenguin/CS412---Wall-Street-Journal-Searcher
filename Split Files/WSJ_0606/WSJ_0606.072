   WASHINGTON -- When White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
took a thinly veiled swipe at Congress on taxes last month,
House Democrats reached for the telephone. Senate Democrats
looked for the cameras.
   A worried House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta
(D., Calif.) called Budget Director Richard Darman to protest
that Mr. Sununu had jeopardized fragile deficit-reduction
talks. Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) raised similar
concerns directly with President Bush when the president
called the speaker about a separate matter.

   By comparison, Senate Democrats elevated the controversy
by going before television cameras. "I don't ever call
Darman," says Rep. Panetta's counterpart, Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.). Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell kept himself one step removed by
having his office verify Mr. Sununu's reported remarks
through channels. The Maine Democrat then argued for Speaker
Foley to join him in a televised statement that condemned the
chief of staff's comments -- painting Democrats as pro-taxes
-- as "untrue, unfair, and ill-timed."
   The Democratic response says a lot about the differences
between the two bodies of Congress. A nervous Senate appears
driven foremost by external, election-year pressures on the
budget talks. The House leadership reflects more the
internal, institutional stakes in reaching some accommodation
on the deficit.
   As budget negotiations resume this week, these lines may
blur, but the contrast between the two chambers underscores a
dilemma for Democrats as the legislative party. To show
strength and retain power -- most immediately in the Senate
-- the party leadership is determined that the White House go
first in addressing the budget crisis. But by waiting for a
reluctant president to act, congressional leaders risk
abandoning their historic constitutional role as keepers of
the nation's purse.
   Leaders in both houses speak less of the founding fathers
than of the dictates of 20th century budget acts, and it took
an irate representative -- under attack for pork-barreling --
to break ranks and mention Article I of the Constitution.
"The Constitution clearly places the responsibility for the
appropriation of public funds on the Congress of the United
States," said Rep. Bob Traxler (D., Mich.) of the House
Appropriations Committee in recent debate. "Not the
president."
   With a 55-45 majority, Senate Democrats come into the
budget talks as skittish as cats. Their backs arch at the
mention of taxes. Claws come out at the prospect of losing
seats in November. Mr. Sasser is a former state Democratic
chairman from Tennessee. Mr. Mitchell is more of a partisan
than his softer Eisenhower Democrat image suggests. His base
of power is built on his success as a campaign chairman
electing Democrats to the Senate in 1986, and he is bent on
protecting this class -- and his own leadership post -- in
the critical 1992 elections two years away.
   After two decades in the Senate, Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen is by nature an inside, incremental
legislator. But after running as the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee, he can't escape the more outside
role of a party leader expected to articulate broader themes.
The gray-haired Texan is quickly annoyed at any suggestion
that he might be influenced by the 1988 campaign, but few are
more pointed in demanding that Mr. Bush address the nation on
the deficit problem before the talks can truly succeed.
   "That's what he hired out for," says Sen. Bentsen. "You
don't just give the good news."
   House Democrats, by comparison, have the more trusting,
workaday nature of hounds. The rank-and-file worry about an
anti-incumbent mood at home and redistricting in 1992. But no
one in the top leadership has ever served in the minority --
or expects to soon.
   Mr. Panetta is a former Republican who has devoted much of
his House career to the budget. Mr. Foley resists public
confrontation and is the last of the appointed party whips to
rise to the speakership. The gruff Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) speaks fondly of Mr.
Bush as a former colleague. As for Mr. Sununu, House
Democrats insist, as one committee chairman put it, that the
chief of staff is just that -- only "staff."
   When Democrats took over the Senate four years ago, their
victory was built on wins in the South and Midwest. These
states are pivotal in talks today -- Mr. Mitchell's
representative, Georgia Sen. Wyche Fowler, is from the class
of '86. But the same regional base imposes limits as well. In
crafting his own budget outline for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, Mr. Sasser had to avoid cuts in agriculture to
placate farm-state allies. And Democrats must cope with the
fact that part of their success four years ago was owed to
their ability to mimic the GOP's own populist, antitax
rhetoric.
   In the years since, the onus has shifted as a Republican
administration now looks for revenue to fend off Pentagon
cuts and finance the savings-and-loan bailout. But anti-tax
pledges could yet haunt freshman senators from Alabama and
South Dakota. And Sen. Terry Sanford, a progressive former
president of Duke University, stumped North Carolina in 1986
as an antitax former paratrooper, whose television ads
attacked his GOP opponent -- then-incumbent James Broyhill --
for supporting federal tax increases.
   A former member of the House Ways and Means Committee,
Sen. Fowler serves as a bridge between the two chambers, and
his most natural allies are the younger, more aggressive
members of the Democratic leadership. House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, Mr. Foley's proxy in the budget talks, was
a colleague on Ways and Means; the Missourian has ties to the
South and is identified with the same Midwest populism that
helped Senate Democrats in 1986. Majority Whip William Gray
of Philadelphia -- perhaps the most political of Mr. Foley's
choices -- is a northern, urban black, but his rapid rise
owes as much to his support in the South, where he has built
alliances with rural, conservative white Democrats as well as
such regional interests as tobacco. "I am not interested in
raising taxes on Americans," says Rep. Gray.
   Mindful of deadlines imposed by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, Mr. Darman is anxious to strike some
settlement by mid-July. But in the early skirmishing, no
agreement has yet been reached on even a target for the
deficit-reduction package. Options swing wildly from $300
billion over five years to a number twice as high, and the
fascination with multiyear plans belies immense problems in
accurately calculating the impact of policy decisions. Among
Republicans, there is increasing tension between Texas Sen.
Phil Gramm, who has proposed to freeze nondefense
discretionary spending, and the more moderate ranking member
of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico.
   Mr. Darman himself speaks in terms of a five-year, $420
billion deficit-reduction package. But as the
savings-and-loan crisis has worsened, Democrats have grown
bolder in bidding up the stakes as a means to test the
president's commitment to permanent changes, including
significant taxes. As a result, after first asking that a
target amount of deficit reduction be agreed on, Mr. Darman
has backed away from insisting on this condition.
   The House is scheduled to begin drafting fiscal 1991
appropriations bills without waiting for a final budget, but
the greater test may come in the Senate as the Democrats seek
to pass their own preliminary budget resolution in the coming
weeks.
   The narrowly divided Senate is more fragmented than the
House and more subject to the whims of individual members.
Any future budget agreement will be put to this same test,
and in an election-year atmosphere, the clean-air debate this
spring was a striking illustration of the differences between
the two chambers.
   Sen. Mitchell was forced to expend immense political
capital and in one case publicly sided with the auto industry
against his own environmental constituency to protect Sen.
Carl Levin, up for re-election in Michigan. By comparison,
Speaker Foley applied his energy behind the scenes more to
avoid votes than win them. When House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) sought to delay
debate, the speaker insisted it go forward. When Mr.
Rostenkowski sought to challenge critical revenue provisions,
Mr. Foley blunted his effort. And when environmentalists and
labor couldn't agree on auto-fuel provisions, Mr. Foley
forced the two sides to come together at least long enough to
allow his Democrats to escape having to make a choice.
