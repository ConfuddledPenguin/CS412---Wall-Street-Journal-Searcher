   BASF AG said it agreed to buy the bulk of Agfa-Gaevert
AG's consumer and professional audio/visual-tape cassette
business for a sum it didn't disclose.
   The Frankfurt, West Germany, chemical group said that it
expects to sign a letter of intent for the Agfa purchase
today and that the companies will complete details as soon as
possible.

   Agfa is a unit of the West German chemical company Bayer
AG.
   BASF said it agreed to buy both the consumer and
professional videotape cassette lines of Agfa but only the
professional audiotape line. The consumer audiotape
operations did not interest BASF.
   BASF, among the world's largest producers of consumer and
professional tapes, has 1.6 billion marks of annual sales,
which represents about 13.5% of BASF's 11.89 billion marks of
world-wide group sales last year.
