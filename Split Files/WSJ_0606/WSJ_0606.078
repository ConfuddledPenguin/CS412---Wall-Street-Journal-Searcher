   NEW YORK -- Paramount Communications Inc. reported a 67%
drop in fiscal second-quarter net income, but the
entertainment company reversed its year-earlier loss from
continuing operations.
   Operating earnings from the entertainment sector dropped
about 13% from a year ago, reflecting write-offs on films,
particularly "Crazy People." And Paramount's publishing
lines, reflecting their seasonal nature, posted slightly
wider operating losses.

   But analysts and investors also are looking to what they
expect will be a strong summer film schedule for Paramount.
And the company reiterated its fiscal 1990 profit forecast of
$2.10 to $2.60 a share.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Paramount shares closed at $49.75, up 62.5 cents.
   Net income for the second quarter ended April 30 fell to
$21.2 million, or 18 cents a share, from $65.6 million, or 55
cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   The latest quarter includes no discontinued operations.
The year-ago quarter reflected a loss of $5.3 million, or
five cents a share, from continuing operations plus $70.9
million, or 60 cents a share, of profit from discontinued
operations.
   Revenue rose 16% to $811.5 million from $699.1 million.
   The latest period includes $21.8 million of interest
income primarily from investment of proceeds from the October
1989 sale of the Associates finance unit to Ford Motor Co.
for $3.35 billion.
   Paramount's "entertainment area has been a little cold
since `Indiana Jones' and except for `The Hunt for Red
October,'" said Alan Kassan, analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   "But their summer schedule looks like it has a couple of
breakout films. `Another 48 Hours' should do very well {and}
`Days of Thunder' could be big, so I think you'll see more
positive earnings momentum in the second half."
   Paramount estimates operating profit from entertainment at
between $200 million and $250 million for fiscal 1990
compared with $252.2 million in fiscal 1989.
   Paramount's publishing lines reported their operating loss
widened to $27.4 million from $25.8 million. The
educational-publishing business reports the majority of its
sales in the fiscal third and fourth quarters, heading toward
the beginning of the school year.
   For fiscal 1990, Paramount expects publishing-operations
profit of $150 million to $175 million. Fiscal 1989 profit
here was $1.6 million, reflecting a $140 million charge.
   Paramount reported fiscal six-month net income fell 69% to
$42.4 million, or 35 cents a share, from $134.8 million, or
$1.13 a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period,
however, reflects earnings from discontinued lines of $128.4
million, or $1.08 a share. Revenue advanced 12% to $1.66
billion from $1.47 billion.
