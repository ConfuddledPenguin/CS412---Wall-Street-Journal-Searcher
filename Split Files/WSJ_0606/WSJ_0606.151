   WASHINGTON -- The Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency,
a World Bank affiliate, said it has approved a $30 million
reinsurance contract covering investments by General Electric
Co. in an electric lightbulb manufacturing venture in
Hungary.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. government
agency, previously authorized $130 million in investment
insurance guarantees for the project. The World Bank agency,
in effect, will assume $30 million of the OPIC risk. Covered
risks include possible losses arising from currency transfers
and expropriation.

   GE announced earlier that it was joining with the
Hungarian Credit Bank in a joint venture to acquire,
modernize and expand Tungsram Co., a Hungarian manufacturer
of lighting products.
   The World Bank agency said it also will provide $50
million in reinsurance coverage for a joint venture in Chile.
Canada's Export Development Corp. previously authorized a
$158 million insurance policy to support a $276 million
investment by Placer Dome Inc. in the gold and silver mining
venture in the Chilean province of Copiapo.
