   Genus Inc., blaming increased competition and lower
orders, said it expects a second-quarter loss on lower
revenue.
   The loss will be between $4 million and $5.1 million, or
35 cents to 45 cents a share, the company said, compared with
net income of $2.6 million, or 26 cents a share, a year
earlier. The Mountain View, Calif., semiconductor-equipment
company said it expects revenue of $9 million to $11 million,
down from $21.3 million.
