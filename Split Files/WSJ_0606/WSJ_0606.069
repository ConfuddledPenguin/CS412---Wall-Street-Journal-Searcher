   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were down across the board in the
week ended yesterday, with longer-term maturities showing the
greatest declines.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker-dealers dropped the most. Average yields on two-year
CDs fell to 8.35% from 8.60%, while average yields on
five-year CDs fell to 8.43% from 8.63%, according to
Banxquote Money Markets, an information service.

   Yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by banks
also dropped. The average yield on a one-year consumer CD
went to 7.93% from 8.00%, while two-year consumer CDs eased
to 8.01% from 8.12%, according to an 18-bank survey by
Banxquote.
   While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks that yield 9% or more.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, also
fell across the board. Average yields on two-year jumbo CDs
fell to 8.11% from 8.22%, while five-year maturities fell to
8.28% from 8.41%.
   "The sharp decline was due to the drop in Treasury rates,
which fell Friday due to weaker-than-expected employment
data," said Norberto Mehl, Banxquote chairman.
