   Forty years after communist North Korea attacked the
South, it looks as if the Korean War could finally be near an
end. Since reaching the 1953 truce, South Korea has proven
its superiority at everything except the North Korean
specialty of repression. Now North Korea's chief ally, the
Soviet Union, seems poised to defect to the winning side.
   President Gorbachev met Monday in San Francisco with South
Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, who emerged to announce their
agreement that in due course "normal bilateral relations will
be restored" between South Korea and the Soviet Union. Mr.
Roh meets with President Bush today in Washington.

   Genuine friendship between Moscow and Seoul could reduce
the risk of a big war starting in East Asia. For decades the
Korean demilitarized zone has been a trigger point separating
the troops of South Korea and the U.S. in the south from the
North Korean army. The North's Kim Il Sung has for decades
carried on a totalitarian balancing act supported by his two
old comrades-in-arms, China and the Soviet Union. So it is a
welcome turn that Mr. Gorbachev met with South Korea's
elected president, leaving the self-designated Great Leader,
Kim Il Sung, to stew in Pyongyang.
   South Korea has a lot to offer, both as a business partner
and model of development. Rebuilding on the war ruins of the
1950s, equipped with institutions that defend property rights
and foster trade, South Korea has forged itself into a
respected democratic power and force in the world market.
Seoul's economic ties with China and the Soviet Union have
been growing for some time, even without diplomatic
relations.
   On the South Korean side, the biggest threat to its
continued progress comes from Moscow's well-armed comrades,
the North Korean communists. Mr. Gorbachev may not have the
power to tell them what to do, but by leaving them to ferment
in deeper isolation, he could help speed their downfall.
   North Korea has a Ceausescu problem. In Kim Il Sung,
Pyongyang fields the world's most longstanding dictator,
installed by Stalin in 1948. Great Leader Kim has whiled away
the decades building monuments to himself and grooming his
son, Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, as his heir. Under the Great
Leader's misrule, North Koreans have completely missed out on
the South's development.
   But North Korea still gets an estimated 70% of its weapons
from the Soviet Union, including advanced MiG fighters. In
return, Pyongyang grants port access to Soviet warships and
overflight rights to Soviet reconnaissance planes. It is a
useful relationship for the Soviet Union if Mr. Gorbachev is
planning to go to war in Asia -- a possibility it would be
foolish to discount as long as Mr. Gorbachev's reforms remain
in doubt.
   If Mr. Gorbachev wants to be friends with Seoul, the least
he could do would be to yank Soviet ties to Stalin's
disgusting legacy on the Korean peninsula. That is what we'd
hope Mr. Roh would demand, and Mr. Bush would second, as the
price of normalizing relations.
   It's understandable that with South Korea still suffering
the growing pains of democracy, Mr. Roh is hoping to draw
popular support back home by hurrying reunification. But
having waited four decades to nail down victory in the Korean
War, South Korea can afford to wait a bit longer, while
asking that in the end game Moscow prove its good faith by
abandoning the bad guys.
