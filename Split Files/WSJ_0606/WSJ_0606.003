   St. Paul, Minn. -- Libby Larsen has come up with a way to
make contemporary opera both musically current and accessible
to the average audience. Her "Frankenstein: The Modern
Prometheus," handsomely produced by the Minnesota Opera and
enthusiastically received at the sold-out premiere in the
World Theater here, treads an engaging middle ground between
the metaphysical spectacles of the avant-garde, represented
by Philip Glass, and the world of "La Boheme" and
"Rigoletto."
   "Frankenstein" unfolds like a regular old story opera,
with characters who sing and interact intelligibly in
English. For the orchestra, however, Ms. Larsen takes her cue
from rock and roll and from Mr. Glass: the 15-member
ensemble, sensitively conducted by Dale Johnson, includes
both acoustic instruments (strings, winds, trumpet and
percussion) and electronic keyboards and synthesizers. All
the sounds are mixed electronically and emanate from
speakers. What is more, Ms. Larsen has given the orchestra a
starring role, and made video and mime an indispensable
component of its impact.

   Ms. Larsen compresses Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's
classic novel into 90 minutes without intermission. The
scientist Victor Frankenstein (Steven Tharp), aided by his
friend Henry (Bradley Greenwald) and his little brother
William (Andrew Ashcroft), attempt to harness an electrical
storm to bring a dead rat to life. That attempt fails, but
later, as his fiance, Elizabeth (Elisabeth Comeaux), pleads
with him to leave the laboratory and come to dinner,
Frankenstein animates a human cadaver. When the scientist
recoils from his creation's experimental embrace, the monster
runs away and murders William; a family friend, Justine (Mary
Laymon), is hanged for the murder. The monster then asks
Frankenstein to create a mate for him. When the scientist
refuses, the monster kills Elizabeth and Henry, and the
scientist is left to wander the world alone in search of his
creation.
   Ms. Larsen, who wrote the libretto as well as the music,
was attracted to the cosmic rather than the horror-movie
aspects of the Shelley story. Her program notes comment on
historical parallels in scientific hubris (18th-century
alchemy and 20th-century nuclear research), and she compares
Frankenstein to that remorseful father of the U.S. atomic
bomb, J.R. Oppenheimer, and the unrepentant Nazi medical
experimenter Josef Mengele (]), "who, by succumbing to
intellectual egotism and ambition, become aliens in the
society they wish to enrich."
   That's what she says, but in her opera, the cosmic tale
has less impact than the personal drama of the monster
created and then cast out. The monster, played mutely and
with tremendous physical presence and grace by dancer/mime
Christian Swenson, is the opera's most sympathetic character,
despite the havoc he wreaks. The havoc, after all, is the
result of Frankenstein's inability to love and care for his
creation. It is as though the woman in the composer says,
"See what happens when men try to give birth]"
   It is a curious opera in which the most affecting
character doesn't sing, but then, the orchestra is Ms.
Larsen's medium. She is no minimalist: Her music is
rhythmically varied, pictorial and harmonically dramatic. The
monster's "voice" comes through in the opera's most
compelling moments: two non-vocal central set pieces. First
is the creature's awakening, in which a tight, vivid
orchestral section evokes an electrical storm, the monster's
disorientation, and finally his poignant, tentative bid for
affection from Frankenstein.
   There may be no words, but there are pictures. A large
movie screen shows the audience what the monster sees. At
first out of focus, the scientist's face, hugely enlarged,
looms into view, as seen from below, with a silver locket
swinging before it. When the monster reaches up and seizes
the locket, the orchestra and the videos magnify the shock
value as powerfully as a traditional composer might have with
a few roulades or a high C. During the second set piece, when
the monster "explains" William's murder, the video shows a
snowy forest tilting crazily as the monster, lost and cold,
stumbles through it, meeting deer (with their young, of
course) and finally coming upon Frankenstein's family and
friends, who are enjoying their cozy home and shut the
monster out.
   Throughout the show, Terry Simpson's video images interact
brilliantly with the rest of the spare production (designed
by Jack Barkla and directed by Nicholas Muni), particularly
in the murder scenes, which are swift, frightening and
without gore.
   That's the good part. Unfortunately, Ms. Larsen's grasp of
traditional operatic principles is less sure. The characters
usually are telling each other what happened, rather than
playing out the drama, and a confusing "play within a play"
structure complicates matters unnecessarily. Two characters
in modern dress, the dying "Victor" (Tom Schumacher) and
Walton (Gordon Holleman), remain on the apron of the stage
throughout the opera. Victor, who is perhaps one of those
modern Frankensteins (Oppenheimer? Mengele?), ostensibly is
telling his story. Their facial expressions are captured with
video cameras and magnified on the four video screens set
around the proscenium, rock-concert style.
   Once the final murder is accomplished, the Victor
Frankenstein/Victor worlds merge. This is doubtless the
working out of the philosophical implications of the story,
but it lost me. Also, apart from a splendid concerted
fantasia for all the characters who sing the name "William"
as they lament his murder, few of the vocal parts of the
opera are as memorable as the orchestral/video ones, despite
the efforts of an excellent cast. Ms. Larsen has created an
ingenious mix of the old and the new. It would be fun to see
her pull off both with equal facility. Maybe next time.
