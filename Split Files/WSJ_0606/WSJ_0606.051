   Few people probably remember much about Robert Wallach,
the friend of Edwin Meese who was RICOed and sentenced to
jail in connection with Wedtech Corp. One who remembers well
is former federal judge Robert Bork, who last week filed the
appeal on Mr. Wallach's behalf.
   Mr. Wallach is an unlikely source for Mr. Bork's
attentions. He is a real-life San Francisco Democrat and
former plaintiff's personal injury lawyer. His idiosyncracies
include styling his name e. robert wallach. He became famous
for sending unsolicited liberal advice in literally thousands
of memos to his old law-school friend and then-Attorney
General Meese.

   That Mr. Bork took on Mr. Wallach's case -- and for what
the now-broke Mr. Wallach says is on a no-fee basis --
illustrates the new definition of a civil libertarian: a
conservative who's seen RICO in action. Mr. Bork's 101-page
brief gives federal appeals judges plenty of reasons to pluck
the Wallach feather off the cap of former prosecutor Rudolph
Giuliani when they hear the case, probably in the fall.
   Mr. Wallach volunteered his legal services to Wedtech in
1981 after learning about this minority-owned business
thriving in the difficult worlds of the Bronx and Pentagon
procurement. The defense firm, which became the largest
employer in the borough thanks to federal minority set-aside
contracts, seemed to be a marvel. It turned out to be a
fraud.
   Mr. Wallach didn't know it, but Wedtech executives Mario
Marino and Anthony Guariglia bribed politicians, including
Reps. Mario Biaggi and Robert Garcia, who were convicted and
resigned from Congress. The Wedtech officers also looted
millions from the firm. But partly in exchange for testifying
against Mr. Wallach, Messrs. Marino and Guariglia plea
bargained sweetheart sentences. Mr. Marino got 18 months in
jail, and Mr. Guariglia got five months in a halfway house --
even after prosecutors admitted he had committed perjury in
Mr. Wallach's trial (see related article: Bork: `A Trial That
Cannot Be Countenanced' -- WSJ June 6, 1990).
   In contrast, federal District Court Judge Richard Owen
gave Mr. Wallach six years in jail. What were Mr. Wallach's
crimes? First, what they were not. "Wallach did not cause
Wedtech to suffer any pecuniary loss," Mr. Bork wrote.
"Indeed, the government conceded that his work, the
performance of which was indisputably legal, was `worth
millions and millions and millions of dollars to Wedtech.'"
Even a congressional report on Wedtech cleared Mr. Wallach of
any legal wrongdoing.
   But RICO means never having to prove a real crime. In
1988, the jury found Mr. Wallach guilty of a new RICO:
mailing allegedly misleading legal bills.
   Here's what happened. In 1983, Mr. Wallach began to be
paid for his work for Wedtech, which included some 200 legal
memos. Mr. Wallach sent a letter to Wedtech officers
acknowledging payment for work on Wedtech's stock offering.
The supposed crime was that the letter failed to mention his
lobbying of Mr. Meese on behalf of Wedtech. Prosecutors
admitted that the lobbying -- which Mr. Wallach denies --
would have been perfectly legal. It was the alleged
incompleteness of the legal bill that made it racketeering.
   Under this view of RICO, the defrauded parties were
Wedtech shareholders. RICO vagaries aside, basic corporate
law says that control of expenses such as legal bills is by
corporate directors, not shareholders. Mr. Bork argues that
since no Wedtech director was defrauded, there was no crime.
   The other racketeering act was based on a second letter
acknowledging a fee for Mr. Wallach's legal services.
Prosecution witnesses Marino and Guariglia said this actually
was a pre-payment for lobbying Mr. Wallach would do once he
had taken a Justice Department job. But Mr. Wallach denies
any such quid pro quo; there was no evidence he was ever
offered any such post; and the conflict-of-interest law
applies only to people who at some point actually hold
federal office.
   Indeed, it's hard to credit the prosecution case as a
serious legal argument. The 8,000-page trial transcript
suggests something else was going on. Mr. Wallach's supposed
crimes had nothing to do with Mr. Meese and they had
everything to do with Mr. Meese. That is, the indictment did
not allege any criminal behavior between Mr. Wallach and Mr.
Meese, yet prosecutors used Mr. Meese to win a conviction.
   The true flavor of the case can be gleaned from the
following part of the prosecutor's summary to the New York
City jury:
   "We had a president for eight years named Ronald Reagan
and you know Ronald Reagan. He was an actor from Hollywood.
He parlayed his Hollywood contacts into political contacts in
California. Eventually he became the governor of that state
and then ultimately he became president of the U.S. and when
he became president of the U.S. he brought to the White House
all of his buddies from California. One of those buddies was
a man named Edwin Meese III. Edwin Meese III had a best
friend and his name was Robert Wallach."
   Prosecutors called Mr. Meese "corrupt" and his
relationship with Mr. Wallach "improper, unethical and
wrong." These were smears with a purpose. "Wallach was not
being tried for any allegations of illegal dealings with
Edwin Meese," Mr. Bork wrote, "yet major parts of the
government's closing arguments were devoted to claims that
there was a corrupt relationship." These included issues as
far afield as a proposed pipeline to the Gulf of Aqaba in the
Mideast and independent counsel and ethics reports on Mr.
Meese. Prosecutors told the jury to convict for some
appearance of an impropriety. Or, as Mr. Bork put it more
subtly, "on a charge not within the scope of the indictment."
   I've had more than a half dozen meetings with Mr. Wallach
since his conviction. His sunny disposition does make him
seem more "quixotic" -- his preferred self-description --
than anything else. He was stunningly naive about Wedtech,
but he wasn't the one who pillaged the firm, bribed
congressmen or confessed to perjury. He doesn't think he got
a fair trial. Probably no fair trial was possible once
prosecutors decided to use RICO.
   Mr. Wallach remains a busy memo writer. In one not long
ago he wrote me this "j'accuse":
   "What happened to me is a dire and really unforgivable
commentary on what has happened to both the world of the
media and the criminal justice system. You may think that
overbroad, but I refer not only to myself but to multiple
illustrations of lives destroyed. Due process is the true
heart of a viable democracy and it is now in jeopardy, as it
has been often in the past. There have been victims. Now the
question is, from where will the redress come?"
   This is classic Wallach -- emotional, maybe somewhat
egotistical, to some even obnoxious. But Mr. Wallach's plea
reflects genuine agony. He asks the right question, the one
about redress, the one that only appeals judges can answer.
