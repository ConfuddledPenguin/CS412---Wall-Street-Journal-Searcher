   MILAN, Italy -- Hourly wages in Italy in March rose 1.1%
from February and 6.6% from a year earlier, Istat, the state
statistics bureau, said.
   The wage index, based on 1982 equaling 100, stood at 191.6
in March, up from 189.6 in February. On a year-to-year basis,
Istat said the increase owed partly to a change in
calculation methods in private-sector mining and cleaning
services industries.

in public administration rose 7.8%, and industrial sector

   Istat said wages outpaced inflation in March, when the
consumer price index rose 6.1% from a year earlier.
