   SUNDERLAND, England -- Shivering against a chilly wind,
Ian Milburn points to drab prefabricated buildings crammed
into a small parking lot at Nissan Motor Co.'s British car
plant.
   "You mustn't be misled by these humble origins," the
Nissan design executive cautions. For inside the temporary
quarters, his colleagues are crafting the first Japanese car
designed entirely in Europe: a four-wheel-drive recreational
vehicle, set for launch in 1993.

   Nissan, like other Japanese auto makers, is sinking roots
deeper into Western Europe, the world's largest car market.
The Japanese plan to get around import limits by greatly
increasing local production and importing Japanese autos made
in the U.S., moves that could double their share of the $180
billion market to 22% by 1995. Their European assembly plants
may roll out more than 700,000 cars annually by 1997, more
than nine times last year's level.
   Now, Japan's big car manufacturers are beefing up a
previously weak leg of this European juggernaut: the selling
side. "It's obviously an essential part of completing their
penetration of the European market," says Daniel Jones, a
motor-industry management professor at University of
Cardiff's School of Business. Stephen Reitman, an auto
industry analyst at UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in London, believes
the new thrust "represents a very serious threat to the
Europeans." Other car makers, while pinched by slowing demand
and overcapacity, "will have to match the Japanese at their
own game" with higher quality, lower costs and extra dealers.
   Japanese auto makers are following a trail blazed by Ford
Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., seeking to become more
sophisticated marketers throughout Europe in a variety of
ways. Among them:
   -- Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor
Corp. have joined Nissan by setting up design facilities in
Europe that modify Japanese vehicles for European tastes and
that soon will devise products exclusively for Europe.
   -- Big Japanese auto producers are enlarging dealer
networks. Their estimated 14,400 dealers in Western Europe
barely surpass the nearly 12,000 owned by GM and Ford alone.
Honda will swell its ranks one-third to 2,000 dealers by
1995.
   -- The Japanese are taking greater control of independent
distributors. In January, Toyota agreed to buy up to 51% of
its British distributor and 4.7% of a United Kingdom
marketing concern that distributes Toyotas in three other
European countries. Nissan is trying to increase its 10%
share of a French distributor and wants to acquire its U.K.
one.
   -- In April, Nissan and Honda opened European marketing
headquarters that coordinate auto sales and service. Nissan's
new operation includes a huge distribution facility in
Amsterdam whose 30,000-car capacity cuts customers' six-week
wait for import deliveries to two weeks.
   -- The Japanese companies are spending millions of dollars
more to promote their emerging European identities and new
upscale imports such as Toyota's Lexus. The luxury car went
on sale in Britain yesterday for 34,250 pounds ($57,389)
each.
   The initial big test of this enlarged European marketing
push will come in Britain, where Nissan, Toyota and Honda
have committed $2.6 billion to major manufacturing
investments. Nissan led the way. Its Sunderland assembly
operation, begun in 1986, produced more than 77,000 midsized
Bluebirds last year.
   Despite the local production and heavy discounting, the
boxy Bluebirds never caught on widely among users of company
cars, whose employers often require European-made purchases.
Ford Sierras and GM Cavaliers dominate the lucrative
company-car market, which accounts for about half of all U.K.
new-car sales. The Bluebird "didn't work as well" as Nissan
had hoped, concedes Han Tjan, a Nissan Europe N.V. executive.
   In Britain this fall, Nissan will replace the Bluebird
with the Primera, a midsized vehicle that went on sale in
Japan last February. Analysts say the sleeker, rounded look
of the Japanese-designed Primera gives it a more European
feel. Nissan designers in Britain are making interior changes
that could enhance the Primera's appeal among Europeans, such
as substituting a round knob for the seat-adjustment lever
favored by Americans and the Japanese. Unlike a
more-luxurious U.S. version also due out in September, the
European Primera also will have a smaller engine and lack
standard antilock brakes, so it will more closely match
Cavaliers and Sierras.
   Toyota, too, is gunning for the British company-car
market, even though it won't start European auto production
until December 1992. The auto maker will increase its 205
U.K. dealers to 240 this year and 340 by 1995, partly to
handle expected Lexus sales. Last month, Toyota exhibited at
a London company-car show for the first time. And it hired an
ex-Ford man to woo company-car fleet managers.
   But rivals of Japanese car makers don't feel threatened by
their increased marketing aggressiveness. "There's nothing
special about any Japanese car. There's nothing special about
selling Japanese cars," says Derek Barron, chairman and chief
executive of Ford's U.K. unit, Britain's biggest auto maker.
"We are the principal players in the British fleet market and
we are going to stay that way."
   Indeed, in both Britain and West Germany, Japanese car
makers are finding it hard to recruit new dealers. They will
encounter an even greater marketing challenge in countries
such as France and Italy where strict import quotas curtail
their clout and strong domestic manufacturers can resist
dealer raids.
   National restrictions are supposed to end once the
European Community becomes a single market in 1992, giving
the Japanese open access to all EC markets. But Ford, Italy's
Fiat S.p.A., France's Peugeot S.A. and some other car makers
want a lengthy transition period, during which they would
count Japanese cars made in EC plants against the quotas for
the first time.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trade negotiator, indicated
in April that the European Commission might embrace such an
approach. Yet including transplants in an extended transition
period could cripple Japanese car producers' carefully
crafted strategy of Europeanization.
   "The EC said, `You can't import here. You have to build
here. You have to be a European,'" recalls Nissan's Mr. Tjan
with a trace of bitterness. "We will have spent $2 billion by
1995" on European factories, he adds. "You can't say, `Okay,
now that you've invested that, we will count your cars as
Japanese.'"
