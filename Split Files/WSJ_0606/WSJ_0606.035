   Bethlehem Steel Corp., still struggling with lackluster
performance at its major Pennsylvania operations, may
eventually have to scale back certain products.
   Chairman Walter F. Williams said the company remains
committed to its three Pennsylvania plants, despite their
continued lackluster performance. But the No. 2 steelmaker
may have to take "some other steps" in the future, he
acknowledges, such as changing the product mix at those
sites. He declined to elaborate.

   Separately, while Bethlehem hasn't yet seen the need to
enter a major joint-venture agreement with a foreign
steelmaker, Mr. Williams said "this could change."
   He said Pennsylvania plants in Bethlehem, Steelton, and
Johnstown have made great strides in becoming more efficient
but continue to face tough minimill competition, excess
capacity and dwindling markets. He pointed out, for example,
that the market for heavy rail, which is made at Steelton, is
practically nonexistent.
   Moreover, minimills have concentrated on bar products,
which Bethlehem makes at its Johnstown plant, and are
increasingly looking to the Bethlehem's own Northeast
backyard to locate operations. In addition, structural
products, made at Bethlehem and used for building, have
suffered from the soft construction market.
   While Mr. Williams doesn't expect to undertake massive
capital programs at those operations, he said the company
would add enough capital to ensure "viable operations as time
goes by." He said all three provide "positive cash flow."
   The company could try to renegotiate a lower-cost labor
accord with the United Steelworkers of America for those
plants. Mr. Williams noted that the 50-month contract,
negotiated last year, recognized that certain operations
facing intense competition might require new contract terms.
"We have been doing some talking," with the union, he said.
   He said he doesn't expect any "big change," such as
closing plants in the near future. "We think we can still
hold our own" in structural, bar, and rail products, he said.
   Bethlehem's prize plants at Sparrows Point and Burns
Harbor, he said are "both very good and will be better." The
company is spending $200 million to modernize its hot-strip
mill at Sparrows Point and recently completed a $50 million
vacuum degassing facility at Burns Harbor.
   Bethlehem also plans to spend $300 million to build three
hot-dip coating lines to create corrosion-resistant sheets of
steel.
   Most other major steelmakers have entered into
joint-venture agreements with foreign steelmakers to build
new coating lines. Bethlehem hasn't to date but it "very
possibly could" at one of the new coating lines, Mr. Williams
said.
   "Up to now we haven't seen a fit," he said. He pointed out
that steelmakers typically form joint ventures to get cash or
technology, but Bethlehem has an untouched $500 million
revolving line of credit and already buys technology from
foreign companies.
   Mr. Williams declined to make a specific second-quarter
earnings projection, but said "we're still predicting that
the second half will be a little stronger and 1991 even
stronger than that." In the year-ago quarter, Bethlehem
earned $84.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on sales of $1.43
billion.
   Steelmakers in general don't expect this year's second
quarter to top the robust year-ago period, when the industry
was still enjoying the tail end of a two-year recovery.
Although prices and orders seem to be rising, most of the
improvements won't be felt until the second half.
