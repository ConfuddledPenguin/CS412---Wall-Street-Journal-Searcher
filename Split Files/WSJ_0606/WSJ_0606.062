   COPENHAGEN -- Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,
surprising the U.S. two days after the Washington superpower
summit, said Moscow unilaterally would remove a significant
number of its nuclear weapons from Central Europe.
   Despite the talk about "rapport" during last week's
U.S.-Soviet meeting, yesterday's move appeared to be timed to
give Moscow a propaganda edge just weeks before the U.S. and
its allies plan to meet to discuss the future of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviets regularly have
pushed for a nuclear-free Europe.

   However, Mr. Shevardnadze said he and Secretary of State
James Baker, who met privately for two hours last night, made
some progress on other issues -- including the thorny
questions of German unification and the reshaping of
post-Cold War Europe. "The areas of mutual understanding on
those complex issues seem to be gradually broadening," Mr.
Shevardnadze said.
   In a speech to a human-rights conference held by the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union would remove the nuclear
weapons "to create favorable conditions" for U.S.-Soviet
negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons. Those talks
could begin later this year. He said the weaponry the Soviets
would eliminate unilaterally includes 1,500 nuclear warheads,
more than 250 atomic artillery pieces, 60 tactical missile
launchers and 3,200 "atomic guns." The meaning of the latter
reference wasn't immediately clear.
   Mr. Baker, who also was here for the human-rights meeting,
hinted that Moscow was making virtue of necessity. He said
the U.S. didn't know whether "these are weapons that would be
withdrawn in any event" as part of Moscow's agreement to
remove its troops from Hungary and Czechoslovakia, former
Soviet satellites. He also said the U.S. wasn't sure whether
the proposal included previously announced promises of
withdrawal.
   Later, Mr. Baker added: "This is something that we and the
NATO alliance have been calling for some time" because Moscow
has "an excess or advantage in these weapons" in Europe. As a
result, Mr. Baker said, "this is something we welcome."
   Mr. Shevardnadze insisted that the proposed withdrawals
"are new figures." But his proposal was so vague that even
the Soviet foreign ministry's spokesman was unable to explain
details.
   A spokesman for NATO called the Soviet reduction "a small
step," and there was no immediate reaction from the U.S.
Defense Department. But analysts at several private
Washington-based research institutes said the proposed Soviet
cutback in nuclear warheads was significant.
   "That's a substantial number in terms of the total number
of nuclear systems they might have in Europe," said Thomas B.
Cochran, a co-author of a handbook on the Soviet nuclear
arsenal that estimates the Russians have about 2,000 nuclear
artillery shells and 1,420 nuclear-tipped short range
missiles in Europe. Mr. Cochran, a physicist for the Natural
Resources Defense Council, noted that the West has only a
rough estimate of the size of the Soviet nuclear
artillery-shell stockpile in Central Europe.
   "Whether it's making a virtue of necessity or not, it does
seem to be a significant reduction," said Lee Feinstein,
senior analyst for the Arms Control Association.
   In Washington, there was some resentment that the Soviets
hadn't mentioned the planned unilateral cuts during the four
days of summit meetings that ended Sunday, and that they
instead sprang the proposal on Mr. Baker on the eve of a NATO
meeting. "It's certainly a surprise," said a senior
administration official, adding, "it's kind of tacky."
   Mr. Shevardnadze said the issue had been raised in working
groups during the summit. Mr. Baker said U.S. arms-control
negotiators and other diplomats who participated in the
summit had scrambled back to their notes of the summit talks
to find any Soviet warning about the plan, but "the Soviets
never got within a country mile of the subject."
   At least in part, the Soviet proposal was a response to
President Bush's announcement last month that he would scrap
plans to put new short-range nuclear missiles in Western
Europe. At the time, Mr. Bush himself was recognizing
reality; there is stiff resistance in Europe to the
modernization program.
   Mr. Bush also said in May that he won't put new nuclear
artillery shells in Western Europe. And he offered to open
talks with Moscow more quickly than previously planned on
cutting existing short-range nuclear missiles. Previously,
the U.S. had stated that it would begin these negotiations
once a conventional arms treaty is signed and implemented.
Last month, Mr. Bush said he's ready to begin the talks as
soon as the treaty is signed. NATO has roughly 2,000 nuclear
artillery shells and rockets in Europe.
