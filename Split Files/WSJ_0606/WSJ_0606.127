   NEW YORK (AP) -- The City Council voted 33-to-0 yesterday
to prevent tobacco companies from distributing free
cigarettes to potential customers or smokers.
   The main target, according to the bill's sponsor, Sal
Albanese, (D., Brooklyn), was to stop people age 18 or
younger from being tempted to smoke. Mr. Albanese said
cigarettes are distributed free on street corners and that
youngsters can get them.

   "In ending this reprehensible practice," the Brooklyn
legislator said, "New York City will not only become the
largest jurisdiction in the nation to ban the free
distribution of tobacco products to the public, but as large
as the next six jurisdictions combined."
   Mr. Albanese said at least 15 other cities, including
Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati and Austin, Texas, also bar the
free distribution of cigarettes.
   He said the legislation would bar individuals and
businesses from distributing tobacco products in public
places or at public events for free or at any price less than
the combined cost of the required taxes.
   The bill still requires the approval of Mayor David
Dinkins.
