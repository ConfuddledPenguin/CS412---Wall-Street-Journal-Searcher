   NEW YORK -- Peter Gumbel, Moscow bureau chief of The Wall
Street Journal, was named a winner of one of the Livingston
Awards for Young Journalists, for excellence in international
reporting.
   Mr. Gumbel, 32 years old, was recognized for stories
detailing how attempts to restructure the Soviet Union's
centrally planned economy have, in some ways, made life more
difficult in that country.
