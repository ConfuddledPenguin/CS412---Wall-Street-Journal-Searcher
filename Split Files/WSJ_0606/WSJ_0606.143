   TOKYO'S NUCLEAR-POWER PLANS

   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry
unveiled a plan to build 40 nuclear-power plants in Japan
over the next 20 years to almost double the country's
reliance on nuclear power to 16.7% of total primary energy
supplies. It already has 38.
   But energy analysts called the plan impractical because
resistance to nuclear plants means such a number cannot be
built and Japan will continue to rely on pollution-causing
coal and oil.
   "Building that many nuclear plants is just a political
target which is almost impossible to achieve," said an
analyst at the Japanese Institute of Middle Eastern
Economies.
   Critics say Japan is unlikely to complete even its
existing plan of building another 16 stations by the year
2000 because of the anti-nuclear movement.
                                                                                                       

   LEBANON'S DESTROYED GENERATION
                                                                                                       

   The Unicef representative in Lebanon said the Lebanese
civil war has killed 40,000 children and destroyed an entire
generation. The representative, Andre Roberfroid, said: "In
this country, in 15 years of war, no less than 40,000
children have been killed, many more wounded, handicapped or
crippled. Fifteen years is the age at which childhood ends .
. . This means that one complete generation of children in
Lebanon has been actually living all its life in an
environment of war and aggression."
                                                                                                       

   BRITAIN'S LORDS SAY NO
                                                                                                       

   Britain's House of Lords defeated a bill that would have
allowed prosecutions of suspected World War II criminals. The
207-74 vote to throw out the measure came after it had been
overwhelmingly adopted by the House of Commons. The Lords
argued that it was wrong to make retroactive laws, that fair
trials would be impossible because of the age of witnesses
and that the legislation would lead to "show trials." But the
Lords' powers are limited to delaying bills for a year, and
the government now must decide whether to reintroduce the
bill in the autumn and force it through the Lords.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ TO END INHERITANCE TAX
                                                                                                       

   Iraq's National Assembly voted to abolish the inheritance
tax, the state-run news media reported. The Al-Jumhouriya
daily said Deputy Prime Minister Saadoun Hamadi advocated the
move because "the abolishing of this tax will work as a
catalyst to encourage wealthy people to invest their money
and help the growth of the economic cycle." The tax was
levied at a rate of between 5% and 50% of the value of
legacies. In 1988, the government collected the equivalent of
about $60 million from the tax.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE SPACE STAKE
                                                                                                       

   Six Japanese companies -- Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan Air Lines, Mitsubishi Trust &amp;
Banking Corp., Shimizu Corp. and Toyo Engineering Corp. --
will buy a 10% share of a U.S. firm planning to lease room in
space missions, a Mitsubishi Corp. spokesman said. The six
companies will buy $10 million of a new stock issue of
Washington, D.C.-based Spacehab Corp., the spokesman said. He
said Spacehab plans to lease containers on spaceships to let
companies and others conduct experiments under weightless
conditions.
                                                                                                       

   VENICE CONTROVERSY CONTINUES
                                                                                                       

   Italy said it would not withdraw its controversial bid for
Venice to be the site of Expo 2000 but added that much of the
world's fair would be held outside the city's historic
center.
   Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti told parliament that if
the Paris-based International Exhibition Bureau chose Venice
the fair would be centered on the mainland cities of Marghera
and Mestre and other parts of the Veneto region. The Paris
exposition bureau is scheduled to make a decision between
Venice, Toronto and Hanover, West Germany, on June 14.
   The proposal to hold the fair in Venice sparked an uproar
from lovers of the city around the world. Opponents argued
that Venice would be irreversibly damaged by new construction
and a massive influx of tourists.
   The European Community's environment commissioner, Carlo
Ripa de Meana, said Italy, due to assume the rotating
presidency of the EC July 1 for six months, will face major
problems in this role if it doesn't withdraw its bid.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   On average, every British man, woman and child over age 10
drinks three cups of tea daily, according to the Tea
Council's annual report. The report said tea accounts for
43.9% of everything the British drink, not counting water. .
. . About two million workers in Greece are expected to
participate in a 24-hour general strike today. Public
services, banking, commerce and transportation are expected
to be seriously disrupted.
