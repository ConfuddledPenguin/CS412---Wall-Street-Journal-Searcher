   Tokyo stock prices bounced up from midday lows to finish
trading nearly flat.
   Most stock prices moved in a narrow range throughout the
day. Trading was moderate, traders said, reflecting
investors' caution ahead of tomorrow, the last trading day
for June stock index futures and options.

   Meanwhile, London share prices gained slightly in
volatile, heavy-volume trading.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues shed 3.75 points to
close at 32921.62, up from the intraday low of 32855. The
index gained 34.25 points Monday.
   At mid-morning Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
retreated 81.94 points to 32839.68.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 600
million shares, in line with 634 million shares Monday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 544 to 394, while 183 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 0.69 point Monday, fell 2.31
points, or 0.10%, to 2424.93.
   However, the buying spree continued on the second section
amid growing volume. The surge partly reflected the
participation of investors who abandoned the first section,
which can be swayed by trading linked to the June index
futures and options, traders said.
   The second section index rose 20.23 points, or 0.50%, to
4013.17, posting gains for the sixth consecutive day. The
index rose 18.32 points Monday. The section's volume was
estimated at 29 million shares, up from 20 million shares
Monday.
   The bitter memory of March's plunge on the Nikkei Index is
preventing investors from active buying this week, observers
said. In March, stock prices were pushed down by heavy
selling triggered by waves of selling linked to arbitrage
unwinding of March stock futures.
   As of May 25, the balance of June contracts buying was
518.154 billion yen ($3.4 billion), according to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, which began disclosing data on futures
trading in April to help ease investors' fear of the impact
of arbitrage selling.
   Selling related to the unwinding of June futures may pull
down stock prices, said Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment
research at Nomura Securities. "But the drop would be only
temporary," he said.
   "In March, sentiment was extremely bearish and
expectations for future declines were dominant. It caused
selling by arbitragers that prompted more selling by general
investors," Mr. Ishii said.
   Bullish sentiment is stronger at the moment so if stock
prices fall, it won't shake the market's recent stability, he
added.
   Also, an increasing amount of positions have been rolled
over to the September contract without being unwound, he
said.
   Some fund managers said they will avoid buying
aggressively until Friday morning, as settlement prices for
June stock futures and options are determined by Friday's
opening prices.
   A fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Co. said if stock
prices drop sharply ahead of the expiration of contracts,
many institutional investors will take it as a good buying
opportunity.
   Selling pressure is much lighter than in March as
institutional investors, the main sellers in March, haven't
bought much over the past months, he said.
   In addition to concern about the impact of the unwinding
of June futures contracts, profit-taking and uncertainty
about the direction of domestic interest rates and exchange
rates discouraged investors from continuing to buy
construction and shipbuilding shares, both of which are
considered interest rate-sensitive, traders said.
   Among construction stocks, Shimizu fell 30 yen to 2140
yen. Ohbayashi fell 10 yen to 1730 yen, and Kajima declined
20 yen to 1980 yen.
   Among shipbuilders, Hitachi Zosen dropped 15 yen to 875
yen, while Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries lost 40 yen
to 1190 yen.
   Investors shifted their attention to electrical shares and
other stocks with strong earnings predictions for the current
fiscal year, traders said. High-priced stocks were especially
popular as their prices usually move up sharply on a
relatively small amount of buying, traders said.
   Kyocera advanced 80 yen to 7950 yen, while Fanuc rose 150
yen to 7240 yen. Pioneer was up 200 yen at 6200 yen.
   Fuji Photo Film gained 60 yen to 4130 yen on expectations
of a gratis distribution, traders said.
   In London, meanwhile, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100 Share Index gained 1.1 points to 2380.1.
   Stocks opened strong, gaining 19.9 points to its peak just
after the start of official trading. The market got a further
boost from the firm opening of the stock futures sector, with
the June FT-SE 100-index trading at a 35-point premium to
cash.
   However, those gains were quickly eroded by the disclosure
of disappointing results by Great Portland, which prompted a
sell-off in the entire property sector. The FT-SE 100 index
shed 16.5 points at the day's low.
   However, a favorable opening on Wall Street, combined with
a firmer pound and the emergence of bargain-hunters in
London, helped that market steady up.
   Volume was 618.2 million shares, up from 430 million
shares Monday.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index advanced 0.5 point to
1893.9.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100-index contract
ended at 2423, up from Monday's close of 2422.
   Many dealers still expect the stock market to creep
higher, in the absence of any negative news. Although they
mostly concede that the market is set for a correction,
sentiment appears to be favoring a further test of upside
potential.
   Among stocks to advance, Allied-Lyons gained 16 pence to
520 pence (27 cents to $8.71) on continued takeover rumors,
as did Scottish &amp; Newcastle, up 4 pence to 338 pence;
Guinness advanced 9 pence to 786 pence; while Midland Bank
rose 10 pence to 310 pence on stock shortage following a
recent market downgrading.
   Among stocks to drop, Pearson ended down 14 pence at 755
pence; and property stocks Land Securities fell 17 pence to
509 pence, and MEPC, dropped 17 pence to 501 pence.
   Meanwhile share prices closed higher in Frankfurt,
Stockholm, Brussels and Zurich, lower in Paris, mixed in
Amsterdam and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
closed slightly up.
   And in Asian and Pacific markets, stocks ended higher in
Sydney and Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong, and lower in
Seoul, Taipei, Singapore and Manila.
