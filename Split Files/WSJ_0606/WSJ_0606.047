   DALLAS -- Some major creditors of Greyhound Lines Inc. say
that peace with the striking Amalgamated Transit Union could
be crucial to a successful reorganization of the GLI Holding
Co. unit, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code on Monday. "They are going to have to
clarify their labor situation," said one large creditor who
asked not to be identified.
   Creditors are concerned about a National Labor Relations
Board complaint alleging that Greyhound's unfair labor
practices caused the walkout. Although Greyhound has said it
is confident it will ultimately prevail in court, the
complaint could result in Greyhound being liable for more
than $10 million per month in back pay to members of the ATU.

   Fearing that such a claim would have priority over most
others in a Chapter 11 proceeding, some creditors say they
will push for an agreement with the ATU. And a few, arguing
that that may be impossible with Greyhound Lines' chairman,
Fred Currey, at the helm, say a trustee should be appointed
to run Greyhound while it is in Chapter 11. "I think the only
way to get the situation moving forward and get things
resolved is to get Currey out of there," said one member of a
recently organized committee of Greyhound bondholders.
   "The creditors are frustrated with management's stated
intention not to seek labor peace with the ATU and it's not
clear that that's the most prudent course of action," said
Leigh Walzer, a bond analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co.
   Mr. Currey, who owns 22.2% of Greyhound's common stock,
also appears to have lost some support from Greyhound Dial
Corp., which sold the bus operation to Mr. Currey and a group
of Dallas investors in 1987. In addition to holding the
leases to many Greyhound Lines buses and terminals, Greyhound
Dial retains a 22.5% stake in GLI Holding.
   Previously, Greyhound Dial allowed Mr. Currey to vote its
stake but yesterday John Teets, Greyhound Dial's chairman,
said he considered that agreement null and void as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing.
   Greyhound Dial also said it is providing for a one-time
charge attributable to discontinued operations of $100
million, or about $2.50 a share, to establish a reserve for
the losses related to Greyhound Lines.
   Still, Mr. Currey has dealt himself some significant trump
cards in the way he filed the Chapter 11 petition, which says
that as of March 31, the company had assets of $508.7 million
and liabilities of $539.8 million, including $98.7 million in
secured debt.
   Instead of Dallas, where it is based, Greyhound filed in
Brownsville, a city of 85,000 at Texas' remote southern tip
and home of Greyhound's bus-manufacturing subsidiary.
Presiding will be U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard S. Schmidt,
41 years old, who administers his docket from Corpus Christi,
Texas, but hears cases in several South Texas cities.
   Already the few local bankruptcy lawyers are wondering how
they will handle the pleadings of the roughly 21,000
creditors in the case. "If they want to get a local lawyer
who knows the judge, there are only about 20 of them out
there for everybody," said Corpus Christi attorney Colin
Kaufman, secretary-treasurer of the Coastal Bend Bankruptcy
Association. "It's a real advantange if you can limit your
number of adversaries."
