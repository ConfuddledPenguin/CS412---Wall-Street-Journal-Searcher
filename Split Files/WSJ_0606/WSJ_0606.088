   WASHINGTON -- Just last spring, high-definition television
was the hottest new technology in town.
   U.S. consumers, the Commerce Department predicted, might
well snap up $100 billion of high-definition TVs and VCRs
over the next two decades. Lawmakers decked out Capitol Hill
conference rooms with HDTV monitors to show off strikingly
sharp taped footage of the Olympics. At a high-level strategy
session, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Pentagon
technologist Craig Fields signaled joint efforts to promote
the technology in the U.S. Then 65 officials from government,
business and academia split into three groups, war-game
style, to map out an HDTV battle plan against Japan and other
foreign competitors.

   "It seemed possible that the U.S. government and industry
could work together in high technology, as they do in Japan,
to close the gap between the U.S. and Japan," says James
Magid, a Wall Street analyst who specializes in electronics
and attended the April 1989 strategy session.
   Today, HDTV is in retreat, a victim of political blunders
by its partisans and relentless opposition in the top levels
of the Bush administration. Mr. Fields has been ousted, Mr.
Mosbacher chastened and other HDTV allies silenced. The very
term high-definition TV is being shunned in Washington for
fear that any proposal identified with it will be snuffed
out.
   High-definition TV has come to symbolize the Bush
administration's technology strategy: An open checkbook for
basic research projects such as the space station or
superconducting supercollider, but a tight fist for
commercial technologies. The latter are best left to private
investors, not government managers, says Richard Schmalensee,
a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. If
U.S. companies can't compete in high-tech markets without
federal help, so be it. "There's no divine right of U.S.
leadership that says our companies will always be market
leaders," Mr. Schmalensee says.
   The only large U.S. company still in the HDTV race is
Zenith Electronics Corp. Some small U.S. firms are scurrying
to build high-definition equipment, but they're all desperate
for money. Just constructing an HDTV manufacturing facility
could cost $200 million. "It infuriates me," says Peter
Brody, president of closely held Magnascreen Corp. in
Pittsburgh, who pioneered high-definition technology years
ago at Westinghouse Electric Corp. "The Japanese walked away
with the technology, and I can't get any money" to develop
new monitors, he says.
   High-definition may well represent the next great leap in
electronics technology. Researchers are experimenting with
various technologies to create sharper images and crystalline
sound, so that watching TV would become like going to a
movie. In Japan, the first of the new sets are expected to
cost at least $5,000 and go on sale next year. They would
then be sold in Europe and in the U.S. in the mid-1990s.
Prices would surely drop as sales increase.
   Later TV sets, incorporating more advanced technology,
would resemble large, thin wall screens. They could have
broad applications. Wall-sized monitors could display maps
and satellite images at Pentagon control centers;
window-sized ones could make next-generation TV sets; smaller
ones could become part of computer workstations and
medical-imaging devices. "High-resolution displays will be
the key to the computer of tomorrow," says Cornell economist
Alan McAdams.
   In the U.S., two little-known federal officials recognized
the potential of HDTV and pushed the government, and a
reluctant electronics industry, to back the technology in a
big way. The two men couldn't be more different in
temperament and political skills -- and those differences
helped determine their careers in government and the fate of
HDTV in Washington.
   The first, Alfred Sikes, headed the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce
Department backwater that he transformed into the
government's first HDTV advocate. Mr. Sikes, a cautious,
patient 50-year-old, once managed political campaigns in
Missouri, and he approached HDTV as a backroom organizer. He
recruited allies in Congress, commissioned studies showing a
huge potential market, courted the secretary of commerce and
pushed industry to devise a plan to pursue the HDTV market.
By late 1988, more than a year after he had started working
the issue, HDTV was getting hot in Washington.
   Then the second official, Mr. Fields, got involved, and
HDTV ignited. The 43-year-old Mr. Fields, intelligent and
aggressive, was the deputy director of the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency. Darpa, a reclusive, $1 billion
Pentagon agency that has pioneered many computer
technologies, sees Japan as an adversary second only to the
Soviet Union. Mr. Fields viewed HDTV, which would use scads
of semiconductor chips, as the coming wave in electronics --
and one that Japan was determined to ride to victory.
   But Mr. Fields approached the problem as a technologist,
not a politician, and stumbled badly. He proposed to leapfrog
the first generation of HDTV sets -- costly behemoths that
will use conventional cathode-ray tubes and weigh hundreds of
pounds -- and develop monitors as wide as four feet across
but not much thicker than picture frames. This meant funding
a host of exotic technologies, such as plasma gases and tiny
deformable mirrors -- but he couldn't find the money to pull
it off.
   He managed to persuade Darpa to start a largely symbolic
$10 million-a-year HDTV program. Then, he clumsily lobbied
Congress and other government agencies for 10 times that
amount -- without any luck. Darpa found itself in the worst
of all situations. Its HDTV foray made it seem as if the
Pentagon were trying to save the moribund U.S.
consumer-electronics industry. That didn't shake loose any
money. Instead, the publicity brought the attention of the
new Bush White House, which chose a hands-off approach to
commercial technology and, except for Commerce Secretary
Mosbacher, opposed HDTV as a handout to electronics
companies.
   "We didn't expect that, in a friendly takeover" -- Bush
Republicans replacing Reagan ones -- "we'd be seen as out of
step," says Robert Costello, a former Pentagon official.
   The usually adept American Electronics Association
blundered as well. In May 1989, the trade group was preparing
a request for $1.35 billion in research grants, low-interest
loans and loan guarantees for HDTV. But it didn't inform Mr.
Mosbacher, until then an HDTV ally, of the specifics of the
plan before he was scheduled to testify on it in Congress.
Mr. Mosbacher glanced at the price tag, turned to Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina
Democrat, and lambasted the trade group for relying on "Uncle
Sugar" for handouts.
   "That was the watershed event that caused HDTV to
decline," Mr. Sikes says.
   Any question of where the White House stood was answered
around the time of the "Uncle Sugar" remark, when Mr.
Mosbacher and Commerce Department Counselor Wayne Berman were
invited to White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's office.
Gathered around were Mr. Sununu, Vice President Dan Quayle,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard
Darman, Economics Adviser Michael Boskin and other top aides.
They were to discuss HDTV, and they weren't happy with the
Commerce Department's role.
   According to several participants, Mr. Boskin, Mr. Darman
and others took turns chewing out Mr. Berman for singling out
HDTV for special treatment, and they cajoled Mr. Mosbacher, a
longtime friend of the president, to take a broader approach
to technology. The message was clear: HDTV was out, and so
was anyone who pushed it too hard.
   One immediate casualty was a Commerce Department study of
HDTV. The study contemplated, as an option, spending billions
of dollars to support the technology and setting technical
standards to block foreign competitors. "It was precisely
what we go nuts about when the Japanese do it," says Mr.
Schmalensee, the White House economist.
   Also marked as a loser was any proposal for the government
to target specific industries for low-interest loans, even if
they need the aid to compete with Japanese companies that can
raise capital cheaply. "If the question is who's going to get
into a low-margin business {such as video displays}, it's
people with lots of capital who bet on high volume over the
long term," says Mr. Berman, describing a slew of Japanese
electronics companies but few American ones.
   By last summer, Mr. Mosbacher had quit the HDTV debate.
"It was like a vaudeville show," says Rep. Les AuCoin, an
Oregon Democrat who supports HDTV. "Someone yanked him with a
hook." (Mr. Mosbacher declines comment, but a Commerce
spokeswoman says he "wasn't yanked at all." Mr. Berman
explains the change by commenting: "We saw that Darman was on
the right track.")
   Mr. Sikes didn't need a hook. Ever the adroit politician,
he stopped talking about HDTV last spring and instead started
campaigning successfully for the chairmanship of the Federal
Communications Commission. Now Mr. Sikes, who sold a group of
small-town Missouri radio stations when he joined the
government, has heads of TV networks and film studios calling
on him for advice. "It's a kick," he says.
   He still has an important role in HDTV, too -- and one
that hasn't raised any flak from the White House even though
it uses technical standards as a tactic against foreign
competitors. He recently said the FCC will take until 1993 to
choose a method by which HDTV programs can be broadcast here
-- giving U.S. companies a chance to catch up with the
Japanese. It wasn't done to hurt the Japanese, "but it may
have the effect of slowing them down," says Richard Wiley, a
former FCC chairman who now heads the agency's HDTV advisory
panel.
   The FCC is leaning toward a system pushed by Zenith, say
officials involved in the agency's deliberations. That would
give Zenith tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments
and a leg up in developing U.S. HDTV receivers.
   Mr. Fields, who moved up to become Darpa's director,
wanted more. He pressed for a broad HDTV technology program
in which the Pentagon would seed U.S. companies with research
money. He won't talk about his role, but colleagues describe
him as dedicated, even obsessed, with the need to strengthen
the U.S. in competition with Japan and other countries.
   Mr. Fields's views closely reflect Darpa's intensely
nationalistic outlook. The research agency budgets just 0.1%
of its grants for foreign companies, even though many of its
grants are supposedly open to all bidders. It also translated
into English the Japanese best-seller "The Japan That Can Say
No" so policy makers could see how the authors argue that
technology can give them a military edge.
   Last July, when Thomas Murrin, the Commerce Department's
deputy secretary, invited Mr. Fields to weekly luncheons with
industry executives, the Darpa director used the occasions to
press his views. "We need a national religious conversion,"
he wrote Mr. Murrin in August, so that the government would
back heavy aid to high-tech industries, particularly
electronics, without worrying whether this transgresses
free-market dogma.
   "Anyone who proposes any ideas for solving the
competitiveness problem can be silenced by accusing him of
supporting `industrial policy,'" he complained. "And anyone
who suggests an approach tailored to the unique circumstances
of trade with particular countries . . . is a `Japan basher.'
It's hard to succeed against such a quiver of verbal arrows."
   Shortly after that, when a portion of the letter appeared
in this newspaper, Mr. Fields fell silent, too. He turned
down interviews, avoided lawmakers and sent his deputy,
Victor Reis, to represent him -- figuring Mr. Reis wouldn't
get Darpa into any more trouble because he didn't set policy.
   From then on, Darpa fought a holding action against HDTV
opponents. It enlisted allies in Congress to protect its tiny
$10 million program. Last November, these Darpa allies beat
back a plan by Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood to kill
the HDTV program. Shortly before Memorial Day, they passed a
provision that freed $20 million in additional HDTV funds the
administration had tied up for six months.
   But these small victories couldn't save Mr. Fields. By
this February, he conceded in a letter to Congress, his
relations with the rest of the administration had
deteriorated so badly that the Commerce Department and White
House science adviser wouldn't respond to his letters asking
for help in devising an HDTV policy.
   The end came suddenly, in late April. An emissary from Mr.
Atwood's office showed up unexpectedly at Darpa and handed
Mr. Fields a piece of paper describing a new job assignment.
Mr. Fields and Mr. Atwood won't discuss the incident, but
congressional and Pentagon staffers say Mr. Fields was told
to sign the paper, resign or be fired for "insubordination."
He signed and now spends his days in a dead-end job studying
the Pentagon's laboratories and looking for work outside the
government.
   Other HDTV advocates clammed up, too. Mr. Murrin, the
deputy commerce secretary and a Westinghouse veteran,
attended the joint strategy session on HDTV and once backed
low-interest loans and other aid for high-tech industries.
Now, he dodges the controversy.
   "It's not practical for Tom Murrin from Pittsburgh, Pa.,
to come here and quarterback these issues," he says. "I'll
get benched so quickly you won't even see I played in the
game."
   But HDTV backers in Congress aren't giving up. Some
Democrats are pushing a $200 million "technology superfund"
that would provide low-interest loans to high-tech companies
and sharply increase funding for a new Commerce Department
technology program. And Rep. AuCoin says he plans to lobby
with the Defense Appropriations subcommittee on which he sits
to increase Pentagon HDTV funding to $100 million. "There's
life after death" for HDTV, he insists.
