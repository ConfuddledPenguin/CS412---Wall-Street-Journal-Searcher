   WASHINGTON -- President Bush named Andrew C. Hove, a
Nebraska banker, to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
board.
   The nomination of Mr. Hove, which was expected, requires
confirmation by the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Hove would fill a position on the FDIC board created
by last year's savings-and-loan bailout law. That legislation
expanded the board to five members from three, adding the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, as well as the
seat Mr. Hove would fill. The other members are the FDIC
chairman, the comptroller of the currency, and another
director chosen by the president, C.C. Hope, a retired vice
chairman of First Union National Bank of Charlotte, N.C.
   Mr. Hove is chairman of Minden Exchange Bank &amp; Trust in
Minden, Neb., which had $75 million in assets as of March.
