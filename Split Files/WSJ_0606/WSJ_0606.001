   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration unveiled its
long-awaited proposal to shift oversight of stock-index
futures to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would
place the products under the agency's stricter approach to
enforcement.
   The measure also would grant the SEC the power to oversee
stock-index futures margins, or the good-faith money needed
to trade the products. The commodity exchanges currently set
those margins, with federal oversight only in emergencies.
Treasury and SEC officials have cited low index-futures
margins as causes for the 1987 and 1989 market drops.

   Index futures, currently regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, enable investors to bet on the
movement of a basket of stocks without owning the actual
securities. Trading in stocks and stock options is overseen
by the SEC. While index futures are widely used by large
institutional investors to control stock-market risk, they
also are used in computer-aided program-trading strategies.
   "The fact that we have separate regulators at this time is
history," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. "It's the
way things started, but it's not the way things should be."
   The proposal now goes to Capitol Hill, where Treasury
officials say it will be introduced in the House at the
administration's request by Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee. In the
Senate, Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.)
will sponsor both a free-standing bill and an amendment to
either pending SEC or CFTC legislation, the Treasury aides
said. A Senate source said it probably will be substituted
for an amendment Mr. Gorton already has proposed to a bill
beefing up the CFTC.
   "The Treasury proposal improves on my original idea of
simply changing jurisdiction," Sen. Gorton said. "It will
allow for innovative new products and strengthened
enforcement."
   The Treasury measure, which took weeks longer to craft
than officials there had expected, faces something of a tough
road, particularly in the Senate. While the Banking
committees are expected to support it and the Agriculture
committees will oppose it, many Capitol Hill leaders are
current or former members of the Agriculture committees.
Those include Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.)
and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D. Wash.).
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who heads the Agriculture
Committee, said he opposes the proposal and plans to fight it
vigorously on the Senate floor.
   The Treasury said the measure is designed for "minimum
disruption to the markets." Stock-index futures would
continue to be regulated as commodities under the Commodity
Exchange Act.
   But the SEC would "enhance" regulation with securities
anti-fraud provisions, such as the prohibition of insider
trading and rules that require a "suitability" test for a
salesperson to sell a product to a customer. The agency,
created after the 1929 crash, is designed to focus on
protecting the individual investor. CFTC oversight is largely
based on the premise that most futures-markets investors are
institutions that need fewer protections.
   A CFTC spokeswoman said the futures markets already have
their own provisions similar to the insider-trading rules and
securities-markets suitability rules. "We are opposed to the
jurisdictional changes," she said.
   The Chicago Board of Trade also opposed the measure,
calling it "creeping regulatory imperialism."
   But Mr. Brady, who is supported in the jurisdiction fight
by the SEC, said, "This is good common sense. It's good for
the American people, and it ought to be law." He said that
the measure would allow for closer coordination among the
stock, options and futures markets and that it wouldn't have
much effect on program trading.
   The bill also would carry out another long-promised
Treasury plan to change a clause of the Commodity Exchange
Act to allow products with futures elements to be traded on
securities exchanges.
   The Treasury also said that if the bill isn't passed, "it
is more likely that minor events will trigger major market
disruptions like the ones we experienced in October of 1987
and October of 1989."
   That statement immediately brought complaints from Sen.
Leahy, who called it "false advertising."
