   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc.'s embattled
chairman, Howard M. "Pete" Love, agreed to step down next
year once the company sheds all but its FoxMeyer wholesale
drug distribution business.
   It's unclear whether the moves will be enough to appease
dissident shareholders led by Centaur Partners Group, which
has demanded Mr. Love's resignation. Centaur has been waging
a proxy fight to gain control of the board, oust Mr. Love and
liquidate the company.

   In a statement, New York-based Centaur said that while it
was "pleased that the accountability we have demanded has
brought this action," it said the entire company should be
liquidated, including FoxMeyer. Centaur said it was awaiting
"the substance of the board's program" and would continue to
seek the election of its slate of directors at National
Intergroup's July 25 annual meeting.
   Still, institutional investors may be willing to let
National Intergroup carry out its restructuring program,
which guarantees that Mr. Love will leave and promises that
asset sales will result in payment of a special dividend or
in a stock buy-back.
   Though several investors were pleased by the surprise
announcement, analysts were generally uncertain how much
additional value, if any, it would provide for shareholders.
National Intergroup didn't specify the size of any special
dividend, which Centaur noted in its response. And the sums
that the company would realize through the disposition of
assets were unclear.
   Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer Inc.,
speculated that a pure FoxMeyer company could be worth
between $25 and $30 a share once it achieves operating
margins comparable with others in the drug distribution
industry. That compares with National Intergroup's closing
price yesterday of $17.375, up $2.50, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. FoxMeyer's operating margins as a
percentage of sales are 1.74%, he said, compared with an
industry average of 2.5%.
   For his part, Mr. Love said he will stay on until the
company sells its Ben Franklin stores, a chain of franchised
general merchandise stores, and its Permian Partners Limited
Partnership oil operation. That should be completed by March
31, 1991, at which time the company would be renamed FoxMeyer
Corp., with annual sales of close to $3 billion and
headquarters in Dallas. Mr. Love said he will recommend that
Robert L. King, currently president and chief executive
officer of FoxMeyer Drug Co., become chief executive of
FoxMeyer Corp.
   Mr. Love said in an interview that he wasn't forced out
but that he planned to leave because his job of creating a
drug distribution company will have been finished.
   "I've completed what I started out to do," he said. "We've
shifted from a metals to a drug distribution company."
   The executive insisted the timing had nothing to do with
next month's annual meeting and expected confrontation with
Centaur. Mr. Love said the company couldn't proceed with its
restructuring until it completed negotiations for the sale of
most of its interest in National Steel Corp. to partner NKK
Corp. That sale, which will leave NKK with 90% of the steel
operations and National Intergroup with 10%, was announced in
April.
   "Ownership of steel had been a major stumbling block to
move ahead," Mr. Love said.
   Still, Mr. Love and the board clearly realized he had
become more of a liability than an asset. The company has
been rocked by losses in six of the last eight years, in part
because of a buying spree that ultimately shifted the focus
of National Intergroup from metals to drugs. The pressure
mounted last year, when another disgruntled shareholder
group, Walker Street Associates, demanded Mr. Love's
resignation describing him as an absentee manager. The group
also blasted directors, describing some of them as Mr. Love's
"hunting, fishing and golfing" buddies, for letting Mr. Love
continue at the helm.
   Board member Douglas Danforth said the board felt no
pressure to remove Mr. Love and that the 60-year-old chairman
told the board he planned to step down at a recent directors'
meeting. "We didn't ask him. We didn't feel pressure," Mr.
Danforth said. "We wanted Pete to stay and guide us through
the divestitures."
   Nevertheless, some investors had grown impatient with
management. Mr. Love said that during a recent round of talks
with institutional holders regarding the Centaur proxy
solicitation, some thought the restructuring was "taking
longer than perhaps some thought it should."
   Institutional investors expressed satisfaction with the
announcement. "We're very pleased," said Ernie Kiehne,
co-manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust. "We think the
values of the company are considerable when various assets
are restructured or sold, leaving FoxMeyer."
   Although Centaur advocates liquidation, National
Intergroup said FoxMeyer should be retained, at least for
now. "We believe FoxMeyer will be worth far more in the
future than what we could sell it for now," the company said.
Selling the company now would also jeopardize tax credits
that could be used to shelter FoxMeyer's future earnings.
