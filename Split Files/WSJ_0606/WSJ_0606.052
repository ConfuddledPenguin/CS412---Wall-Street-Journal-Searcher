   A `Third World' Car
   Is Stuck in First Gear

   TO DO GOOD, a young designer is finding he first has to do
well.
   Daniel Sturges designed an inexpensive, lightweight,
three-wheeled car that he hoped would give Third World people
and cargo easy mobility. But it turned out that the Third
World was less interested in Mr. Sturges' "China Car" than in
big, expensive American autos.
   "Third World people want Western stuff," says Mr. Sturges,
a 26-year-old veteran of the design shops at Ford and GM.
   So Mr. Sturges and his Caleb Inc. of Boulder, Colo.,
shifted their focus to the U.S. Now he envisions his renamed
"Platform Vehicle" puttering around campuses, retirement
communities and between home and commuter stations. "They can
make the car in the Third World for the U.S. market," he
says. "And if it's accepted in the U.S., the Third World will
like it, too."
   To keep the weight under 300 pounds and the price at about
$2,000, the Platform Vehicle would be made largely of
plastic. The basic platform could be fitted with options such
as a roof, cab or cargo floor. And it would cruise at about
30 miles an hour.
                                                                                                       

   Canon Has Had Its Fill
   Of Reused Cartridges
                                                                                                       

   IN 1982, CANON INC. developed a cartridge for its desktop
copiers, fax machines and laser printers. The cartridge
neatly contains the photosensitive drum, developer unit and
toner powder, which acts like ink. When the toner is used up,
the customer simply throws away the old cartridge and inserts
a new one.
   That is, unless he inserts a refilled one -- to Canon's
dismay.
   Not long after the design came to market, entrepreneurs
discovered that they could refill, or "recharge," the old
cartridges with new toner and sell them again, for as little
as $50, instead of the $80 to $125 charged for new
cartridges. Refilling and selling used Canon cartridges has
become a $44 million business, according to Cheryle White,
president of the fledgling Association of Professional
Cartridge Recyclers.
   Recyclers claim that Canon, alarmed by the loss of
potential cartridge sales, has put extra abrasives in its
toner, aiming to destroy the drum after one use. A spokesman
for Canon, which expects to sell nine million cartridges this
year, calls the charge "totally incorrect."
   Nevertheless, Canon and its allies are fighting back.
Hewlett-Packard Co., which uses Canon cartridges in its laser
printers, warns that anyone who uses refilled toner may void
the warranty. Responding to environmental criticism about the
product's disposability, Canon and Hewlett-Packard have just
announced a plan to collect spent cartridges and use them to
make new ones. For each cartridge turned in, they say they
will donate $1 to environmental causes.
   Refillers are unimpressed. "They're just trying to get
cartridges off the market to discourage recharging," Ms.
White says.
                                                                                                       

   Hot on the Tail
   Of Mobile Doghouses
                                                                                                       

   IF ROVER IS a roamer, now his woof can go with him.
   New York's Cooper-Hewitt Museum and Guiding Eyes for the
Blind Inc., a guide dog training school, asked architects and
others to design innovative doghouses. Those who responded
produced doghouses out of a junked TV set, dog biscuits,
corrugated paper and other odd materials.
   Nicholas Goldsmith of F.T.L. Associates in New York
contributed a doghouse consisting of plywood frames with
waterproof fabric strung between. The frames are hinged at
the bottom so the doghouse can fold flat. A strap permits Mr.
Nicholas' "Puptent" to be carried over the shoulder.
   Another portable doghouse was submitted by Christopher
Delaney and Andrea Cochran of San Francisco. Built on the
principles of origami, it consists of galvanized steel, with
a floor of aluminum covered with Astroturf. When four pins
are pulled, it flattens and can be carried with a handle.
   Both portable doghouses weigh about 40 pounds, too much,
the designers concede, for easy carrying. Lighter materials
-- aluminum, plastic, waterproof cardboard -- could cut the
weight in half, they say.
   "The Doghouse" exhibition, with 24 canine residences, will
be at the Cooper-Hewitt from Friday until Oct. 14.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE CORPORATE Design Foundation and Interiors magazine
have given their second annual Corporate America Design
Awards to Paul Cook, CEO of Raychem Corp.; J. Irwin Miller,
former chairman of Cummins Engine Co.; and Gordon Segal,
president of Crate &amp; Barrel. . . . Step on it: Interdome Inc.
of Los Angeles offers a sheepskin pad that sticks to the car
floor under the foot pedals, to prevent high heels from
getting scuffed.

   HEWLETT-PACKARD Co. says use of a non-Hewlett toner in its
laser printers does not, by itself, affect the overall
warranty on the printer. "However," the company says, "if an
HP LaserJet failure or damage is found to be directly
attributable to the use of a non-Hewlett toner cartridge,
Hewlett will not repair the printer free-of-charge."
Wednesday's Form + Function column said Hewlett "warns that
anyone who uses refilled toner may void the warranty."
