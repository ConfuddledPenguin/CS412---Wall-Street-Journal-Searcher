   SEATTLE -- Immunex Corp. said federal regulators granted
so-called orphan drug designation to the company's first
drug, giving the biotechnology company exclusive rights to
market the drug for seven years if regulators approve the
drug.
   The orphan designation is a boon for Immunex, which
applied with the Food and Drug Administration last February
for a license to sell the drug, called granulocyte macrophage
colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF. Immunex said it spent
over $20 million to develop the drug, the company's first to
apply for FDA approval.

   The FDA's orphan designation for GM-CSF covers treatment
of certain bad side effects of bone-marrow transplants and
the promotion of successful bone-marrow transplants. The drug
is an immune-system hormone that stimulates growth of
infection-fighting white blood cells.
   The FDA grants orphan status to certain drugs that have
small patient populations. The status is meant to encourage
drug companies to develop products that might not be
profitable without exclusive marketing rights that protect
the drug from competition. The seven-year exclusivity "would
give us the opportunity to recoup the investment we've made
in the drug," said Stephen A. Duzan, chairman and chief
executive officer of Immunex.
   The orphan designation "is also an indication that our
first application is moving well through the FDA; when you
haven't yet got a product to market that's obviously
gratifying," he said. Mr. Duzan said he expects FDA approval
to come by early next year. Immunex developed the drug
jointly with Hoechst AG of West Germany, he said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Immunex
closed at $26.25, up 75 cents.
