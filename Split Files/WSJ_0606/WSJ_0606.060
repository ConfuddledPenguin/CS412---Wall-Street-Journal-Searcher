   NEW YORK -- Stephen Berger, who began a massive facelift
of the New York region's airports, river crossings and cargo
docks, said he would resign as executive director of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey next month.
   Mr. Berger said he was leaving the job he has held since
October 1985 to become president and chief executive officer
of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., a subsidiary of General
Electric Capital Corp., itself a unit of Fairfield,
Conn-based General Electric Co.

   Local transportation officials praised Mr. Berger, 50
years old, for upgrading the Port Authority's basic
transportation facilities and streamlining its management
structure. Mr. Berger "refocused the Port Authority on its
basic businesses of airports, Hudson River crossings and
maritime terminals," said Tom Downs, New Jersey's
Transportation Commissioner. "He put capital back into those
facilities rather than let them be simply cash cows."
   Port Authority officials said they were surprised by Mr.
Berger's decision to leave. Richard Leone, the Port
Authority's chairman, said he expects it will be a matter of
weeks before Mr. Berger's successor is named.
   Mr. Berger said he has received job offers in recent years
but the one from Financial Guaranty Insurance, an insurer of
municipal bonds and other securities, was "very hard for me
to turn down." Although he declined to specify his salary at
Financial Guaranty, it is believed to be substantially higher
than his $170,000-a-year Port Authority salary.
   Mr. Berger will succeed Gerald L. Friedman as chief
executive officer and president of Financial Guaranty. Mr.
Friedman, 53, a co-founder of the company, retains his
position as chairman. The company, which was founded in late
1983, became a GE subsidiary through General Electric Capital
last year. A Financial Guaranty spokesman said Mr. Berger
will be responsible for the company's municipal finance
operations as well as its expansion into the European market
for nonmunicipal debt instruments.
   Prior to joining the Port Authority, Mr. Berger worked in
the private sector as an investment banker with Odyssey
Partners and director of corporate development for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. In the mid-1970s, Mr. Berger was executive
director of the state agency that designed a financial plan
enabling New York City to regain its credit standing during
its worst fiscal crisis.
   The $6 billion rebuilding program launched by Mr. Berger
has included money to upgrade the Port Authority's three
major airports, its rail system linking New York and New
Jersey and its harbor facilities. Under Mr. Berger the Port
Authority entered into a joint venture with a private firm to
restore commuter ferries across the Hudson River.
   He struck an agreement with ship companies and dockside
labor to lower the cost of shipping cargo through New York,
stemming a decline in port cargo. Mr. Berger has tried to
streamline the Port Authority's bureaucracy, taking out
layers of management.
   But many problems face Mr. Berger's successor. A slowdown
in New York's regional economy after a burst of prosperity in
the 1980s could undermine further capital spending on the
authority's facilities. Indeed, Mr. Berger's plan for another
boost in trans-Hudson bridge and tunnel tolls and rail fares
was turned down last year by the governors of New York and
New Jersey. As a result, the Port Authority deferred $300
million in capital expenditures this year. And its plans to
build a central terminal and people-mover shuttle at John F.
Kennedy Airport were postponed because of a cool reception
from airlines.
