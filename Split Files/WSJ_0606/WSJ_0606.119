   THE SOVIET UNION ANNOUNCED unilateral arms cuts in Central
Europe.
   Shevardnadze, at an East-West conference in Copenhagen,
said Moscow would remove a significant number of its nuclear
weapons from the region "to create favorable conditions" for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. The
Soviet foreign minister also met with Secretary of State
Baker and suggested that they had made some progress on the
issue of German unification. In Moscow, the Soviet
legislature tentatively postponed adoption of a law to ease
limits on emigration, a move that could jeopardize a
Bush-Gorbachev summit agreement that would increase Soviet
trade with the U.S.

education.

battled government troops for control of an area about 25

coast, poised to help evacuate Americans.

   Two rival Cambodian leaders signed an agreement in Tokyo
calling for a conditional cease-fire to end 11 years of civil
war in the Southeast Asian nation. But the accord, reached by
Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen and guerrilla coalition
leader Prince Sihanouk, was given little chance of success
because of a boycott by the Khmer Rouge.

   East German joblessness tripled since April and the

   South Korea's Roh expressed hope that his talks Monday

   A Michigan doctor helped an Alzheimer's patient commit
suicide, allowing her to use a device to administer a lethal
dose of chemicals. The woman, 54, pressed a button on the
contraption, built by the physician, that released the
mixture, the doctor said. Some medical ethicists called the
doctor's actions immoral and perhaps illegal.

   Presbyterians adopted a statement of faith combining
Christian beliefs with environmental concerns and likening
God to both a mother and father. The Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) statement, which must be ratified by the Protestant
denomination's members, is the first since a 1983 merger
ended a 122-year split within the church.

   The Senate refused to limit debate on an omnibus
anti-crime bill. Democratic opponents are expected to try
again tomorrow to invoke cloture. Failure to do so could
extend debate on more than 240 pending amendments for weeks,
and prompt the Democratic leadership to pull the legislation.

French-speaking Quebec special status.

Amritsar.

   Ethiopia said it would allow a rebel-held Red Sea port to
be used for the delivery of food to millions of famine
victims. The strategic port of Masawa has been closed since
it was captured by the insurgents in February. The rebels,
meanwhile, warned of attacks if a plan to use Soviet planes
to transport U.S. relief supplies is carried out.
