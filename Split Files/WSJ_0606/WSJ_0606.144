   NEW YORK -- Responding to concern that black television
viewership is underreported, Nielsen Media Research said it
would improve the way it measures the size of minority
audiences.
   The changes, to take effect next year, will include
breaking out black demographics in monthly reports on TV show
ratings. Under the new system, for instance, there will be
categories such as black men 18-to-49 years old. Currently,
there is no such break-out.

   Nielsen also proposed introducing a national black
"pocketpiece" report including household and demographic
information based on TV viewing among blacks. Such reports on
the general viewing audience are already produced for
broadcasters.
   Separately, Tribune Entertainment Co, a division of
Tribune Co., distributor of such shows as "Soul Train" and
"Dionne &amp; Friends" with singer Dionne Warwick, said it would
begin an awareness campaign to encourage blacks to
participate in viewing surveys.
   Also participating in the campaign are two advertising
agencies, Burrell Advertising Inc. and Uniworld Group Inc.
One possibility is to get a rap singing group to appear in
public-service announcements.
   Blacks return Nielsen diaries at a 42% response rate,
compared with the so-called general market, where diary
returns run at a 55% rate, according to David Woolfson, vice
president of new business for Nielsen Media Research, a
subsidiary of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Co.
