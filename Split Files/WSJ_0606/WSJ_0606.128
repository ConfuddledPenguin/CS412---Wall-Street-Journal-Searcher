   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., in a shuffling of
franchise territories, said it agreed to buy a bottler in
Arkansas for $250 million and to sell properties in Ohio for
$120 million.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, a major Coca-Coca bottler, agreed
in principle to buy Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Arkansas for
cash from Coca-Cola Co., the Atlanta-based soft-drink giant.
Coca-Cola owns about 49% of Coca-Cola Enterprises.

   At the same time, Coca-Cola Enterprises agreed in
principle to sell Portsmouth Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and a
majority interest in the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Ohio to
Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc., a closely held
independent bottler based in Chattanooga, Tenn.
   For Coca-Cola Enterprises, the sale of the Ohio businesses
will result in a second-quarter pre-tax gain of $55 million.
The gain will be partly offset, however, by a $10 million
increase to reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts
receivable. A Coca-Cola Enterprises spokesman said the
company believed that adding to the reserves was prudent in
light of the increasingly leveraged nature of some of its
retail customers.
   Also in the second quarter, Coca-Cola Enterprises will
take about $9 million in charges related to standardizing its
computer information systems.
   The net result of the special items will be a per-share
gain of about 15 cents to 16 cents in the quarter, the
company said. In the year-ago second quarter, Coca-Cola
Enterprises earned 26 cents a share, when net was $38.8
million.
   Coca-Cola said it expects to report a gain of less than
one penny a share from the sale of the Arkansas bottler. A
Coca-Cola spokesman said the soft-drink company is selling
the bottler for the price it paid for it last year, plus some
related interest costs.
   In addition to parts of Texas, the territories covered by
the Arkansas bottler include the cities of Little Rock, Ark.,
and Shreveport, La., and other areas in Arkansas and
Louisiana. The purchase could provide benefits to Coca-Cola
Enterprises because those areas are contiguous to some of the
company's existing territories, particularly around big
markets like Memphis, Tenn., and Houston. Patching together
contiguous territories can allow a bottler to cut costs by
consolidating production, among other things.
   "Coca-Cola Enterprises has tried to concentrate its
efforts in the South and on the West Coast," said George
Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
"This is just another effort in that direction."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $15.875, down 12.5 cents.
