   Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Stockholm, agreed to
acquire the 78.3% of its London-based affiliate, Scandinavian
Bank Group, that it doesn't already own, the latest step in
the big Swedish bank's drive to expand in European investment
banking and fund management.
   SE Banken said it will pay #152.7 million ($225.8 million)
for the rest of Scandinavian Bank, valuing the commercial and
merchant bank at #195 million. Sellers are Den norske Bank of
Norway and Union Bank of Finland, each with a 31% stake;
Unibank of Denmark, 12.5%; and Landsbanki of Iceland, 3.8%.
The five banks took Scandinavian Bank private last December
in a deal that valued it at #179 million.

   Scandinavian Bank, which had shifted to investment banking
and international lending, had a 1989 pretax loss of #3.2
million, its second consecutive deficit. But its attraction
is its international network, bringing SE Banken offices in
Sydney, Australia, and Brazil, and a potential jewel, a Swiss
unit, Banque Scandinave en Suisse, in which Chicago-based
Northern Trust Corp. holds a 21% minority interest.
