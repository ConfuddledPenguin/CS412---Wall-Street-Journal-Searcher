   You Can Bet Someone Out There

   As urban problems go, groundhogs don't rank that high in
most places. In Columbus, Ohio, however, the fat, furry
creatures have overrun the airport, and the authorities there
want to take up arms -- literally -- against them.
   But turning prairie land next to the paved runways into a
sort of Wild West makes some people uneasy. The issue came to
a head Monday night, when the City Council voted on whether
to allow airport personnel to use firearms against several
thousand of the burrowing rodents.

   The problem stems from a population explosion beneath the
grassy 180-acre field. Officials attribute the groundhogs'
fertility to a spate of warm winters.
   The plump creatures "don't hibernate as long as they did
in colder weather," says John Carpenter, operations officer
for the Port Authority International Airport. "They get bored
and have to do something, so they have more kids."
   And a mischievous lot they are. Among other things, they
burrow underground and gnaw on buried electrical cables. Mr.
Carpenter also fears a gamboling groundhog may collide with a
small aircraft and perhaps mangle the landing gear.
   Federal regulations being what they are, Mr. Carpenter
says the groundhogs cast a shadow over the future of the
airfield. Airport authorities have tried to kill the critters
by dropping cannisters of poison gas into burrows and setting
traps above ground.
   "Somone suggested mothballs, but with 180 acres, you're
talking about a lot of mothballs," Mr. Carpenter says.
   Desperate, officials asked the city if the airport could
arm several maintenance employees with shotguns and so-called
varmint slugs, which have a hollow point and spread out upon
impact, thus tending to kill rather than wound. "It's a very
humane way to go," says Mr. Carpenter.
   But the council rejected the idea by a 5-2 vote. Members
said that the plan sounded extreme and that there might be
better ways to control the population.
   Like contraception. Animal-rights representatives argued
at the council meeting that Columbus should consider wildlife
birth control, which entails putting chemicals into animal
food.
   "In the case of nuisance animals, man's first solution is
`let's kill it,'" says Robin Russell, director of Protect Our
Earth Treasures, an animal-rights group. "But if you use
birth control, after a couple of years, you've eradicated the
problem."
