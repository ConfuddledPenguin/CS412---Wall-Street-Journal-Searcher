   The time has come to ask just whose side the teachers'
unions, school bureaucrats and some civil-rights groups are
on: their own or the kids who endure the dismal state of
education in so many parts of this country? In Wisconsin, the
answer is becoming very clear.
   There, officials of the state's largest teacher union and
officials of the NAACP are suing to have the nation's first
experiment in school vouchers for low-income children
declared unconstitutional. If they win, the losers will be
hundreds of inner-city children who expect to attend a school
of their own choosing in September.

   The Wisconsin voucher plan is the brainchild of State Rep.
Polly Williams from inner-city Milwaukee. She raised four
children as a single parent on welfare before finally
graduating from college. Elected as a Democrat and twice the
chair of Jesse Jackson's campaign in Wisconsin, she has
nonetheless become convinced that government programs prevent
her constituents from exercising real power and choice in
their lives. Nowhere is this paternalism more evident than in
the public-school monopoly.
   Convinced that the rigid bureaucracy of Milwaukee's public
schools would never reform itself without outside
competition, Mrs. Williams pushed through a bill that will
allow 1,000 low-income Milwaukee students to attend private,
nonsectarian schools. For every child using that option, the
state will pay up to $2,500 in tuition and subtract the money
from the state's support of Milwaukee public schools.
   Mrs. Williams says her plan is not designed to undermine
public education, but to force it to improve. She says the
notion that sending minority children to private schools will
promote segregation and elitism is nonsense. Many Milwaukee
private schools are multicultural or Montessori institutions
with tuitions that are discounted to accommodate lower-income
families. In both Milwaukee and nationwide, minorities make
up 13% of those attending private schools.
   The groups suing to block the Williams plan say the
transfer of money from public to private schools is
unconstitutional, though by that reasoning a city couldn't
contract out garbage collection to a private firm. The real
objection to vouchers is the fear that they will work and
thereby expose the loss of faith in the public-schools
system.
   Milwaukee Alderman Larraine McNamara-McGraw says the
public-school system is "not a perfect structure, but it's
the only one that pretends to educate all the children." Mrs.
Williams says that "pretends" is precisely the right word.
"If you keep giving money to the same doctor and the patient
stays sick, you've got the right to get a second opinion,"
she told us.
   State School Superintendent Herbert Grover has practically
begged teachers' unions to challenge the plan in court. He
calls vouchers "ludicrous," and hopes the suit results in an
injunction that would keep him from implementing the program
this fall. (The NAACP in Wisconsin hasn't yet clarified its
rationale for opposing the program.) Meanwhile, he is forcing
schools that want to accept students with vouchers to comply
with a blizzard of rules by June 15.
   Mrs. Williams expects what she calls "the poverty
industry" to throw up more roadblocks. "We have to be saved
from our saviors," she says. "Our liberal friends have built
their whole lives around taking care of us and they still
want to feed us with Pablum. At some point, we want real
food. We want to make our own decisions whether our liberal
friends like it or not."
   This kind of talk is winning Polly Williams converts on
both the left and right. Elaine Ciulla Kamarck, a senior
fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, says Mrs.
Williams is challenging "an entrenched establishment whose
livelihood depends on continuing certain programs regardless
of their effectiveness." In Detroit, City Councilman Keith
Butler is supporting a slate of pro-voucher candidates in
this year's school board elections. In Ohio and Kentucky,
black GOP congressional candidates Ken Blackwell and Al Brown
are being urged to make vouchers a cornerstone of their
campaigns.
   As Brookings Institution scholar John Chubb points out in
a nearby article, public education in America resembles
socialist central planning. Like socialism, it cannot be
fixed with half-measures or more spending. The system must be
freed up and competition encouraged.
   That is why the education establishment is trying to drive
out Polly Williams's voucher plan with lawyers and strangling
rules. Mrs. Williams's position is that this reactionary
crowd doesn't have to choose between its own interests and
those of the students: "If you all are worried about your
jobs, try doing them better."
