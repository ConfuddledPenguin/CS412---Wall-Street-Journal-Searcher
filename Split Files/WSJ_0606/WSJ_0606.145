   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Qintex Entertainment Inc., which
last October filed for bankruptcy-law protection, said its
board approved the sale of operating assets for more than $65
million. The company is a unit of Qintex Ltd.
   According to a Qintex spokesman, the debt outstanding of
the company as of Oct. 31 totaled $91.8 million. The company
said funds from the asset sales will be allocated to
creditors in accordance with the reorganization plan to be
filed with the bankruptcy court.

   Qintex, which produces and distributes filmed
entertainment products, said it agreed to sell its
entertainment assets for $42.4 million to RHI Entertainment
Inc., a private, New York-based television production
company. The sale includes the company's library, accounts
receivable, development projects and $7 million cash, Qintex
said. The Qintex spokesman said RHI's owners include Robert
Halmi Sr., a Qintex co-chairman of the board.
   Qintex said HR Broadcasting Inc., a private owner and
operator of independent television stations, of which Qintex
has an interest in the form of notes and convertible
debentures, will sell some assets. Qintex said as a result,
it would receive at least $23 million from HR Broadcasting's
sale to ABRY Communications, a Boston-based private owner of
independent television stations.
   The sale includes television stations WTTO in Birmingham,
Ala., and WCGV in Milwaukee.
   Qintex Entertainment is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia, a
unit of Qintex Ltd., based in Brisbane, Australia. Both sales
are subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and
approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
