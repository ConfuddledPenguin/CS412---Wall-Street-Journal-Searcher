   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department, citing national
security concerns, rejected a U S West Inc. plan to build a
fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union.
   U S West said it received a letter from the department's
bureau of export licensing saying it would oppose export by
any country of sophisticated telecommunications technology to
the Soviets. Specifically, it cited equipment with
transmission speeds of 140-megabits-per-second or higher. The
U S West fiber project's speed would be 565 megabits per
second, three times slower than state-of-the-art
telecommunications technology in use in the U.S. today.

   U S West said it is pursuing a 30-day review, and is
concerned that its partners in the trans-Soviet project or
other foreign companies that have fiber-optic technology
could go forward on their own. The department, however,
expressed confidence that no country would ship such gear
without U.S. approval.
   The Commerce Department rejection comes on the eve of the
Paris meeting of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Security Controls, the 17-nation committee that sets
guidelines on what technologies can be shipped to the Soviet
Union and other communist countries.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. signaled that it would push
to allow exports of certain telecommunications equipment to
Eastern Europe, a move applauded by Western
telecommunications companies, which generally view Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union as sizable, if not rich, markets.
Phone companies and equipment makers are eager to get their
foot in the door, anticipating a more robust market for phone
equipment and service as more Western companies set up
business in the Soviet bloc.
   Meantime, the Soviet Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, concerned about its outmoded
communications networks, has encouraged Western projects. The
U S West fiber pipeline was to have two parts: a fiber link
across Siberia connecting Europe and the Pacific Rim, and an
intra-U.S.S.R. network. U S West was joined in the Soviet
fiber project by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
as well as Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan, Societa
Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, British Telecommunications
PLC, and other phone companies in Australia, Denmark and West
Germany.
   In a recent interview, U S West Chairman Jack MacAllister
said the project had enthusiastic support within the Soviet
Union and among businesses in Europe and the Pacific Rim.
Laird Walker, who heads the company's Washington office, said
yesterday that the project "represents an important
telecommunications link that will further open Soviet society
and enhance world communications." The company apparently
faces an uphill battle convincing the Commerce Department of
that.
