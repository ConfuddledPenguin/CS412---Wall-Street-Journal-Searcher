   Well, it looks as if there may still be one or two things
you still can't do. Even more amazing, you can't even get a
court to legalize approval. This was established in a federal
appeals court in Chicago yesterday, which ruled that two
Illinois policemen couldn't wear diamond ear studs. The court
decision said, "It is obvious from the record that the
plaintiffs not only caused an adverse impact on police
discipline, esprit de corps and uniformity" but also "caused
great public dissatisfaction as well." It's nice to see
esprit de corps win one.
