   LOS ANGELES -- The U.S. Justice Department decided it
wouldn't join a lawsuit against Hughes Aircraft Co. brought
by a Hughes employee who accused the company of overcharging
the government $50 million on development of radar systems
for military aircraft.
   The suit was filed in federal court in Los Angeles last
year by William J. Schumer, a former contracts manager for
Hughes's radar systems group. Mr. Schumer is currently
assistant contracts manager for Hughes missile systems group.

   The suit alleged that between 1983 and 1988, Hughes
shifted costs from contracts for the F-15 jet fighter to
contracts for similar work on the B-2 stealth bomber and the
F-18 jet fighter. Hughes is a unit of General Motors Corp.
   Hughes has denied any wrongdoing. The suit is the third
filed against Hughes under the False Claims Act that the
government has declined to join since February. The
government hasn't yet taken any action on a fourth such suit
filed against the company last year, Hughes said.
   Dean Francis Pace, a Los Angeles attorney for Mr. Schumer,
said he hadn't been informed of the government action.
