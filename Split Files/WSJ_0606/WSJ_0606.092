   HOLLYWOOD -- "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" seemed like the
perfect movie to market on videocassette: It had been a
box-office blockbuster. It was popular with children, who
often wear out videos like record albums, watching them again
and again. And it had the marketing clout of Walt Disney Co.
behind it.
   So in March, Disney flooded the market with copies of the
movie. But consumers didn't bite in anywhere near the
expected numbers. Though sales are projected to exceed four
million units, some distributors say the studio is allowing
them to return as many as half the tapes they had ordered.
Disney won't confirm any figures.

   When Disney rolled out "The Little Mermaid" on video last
month, it took a more conservative approach, shipping fewer
units initially. The movie, targeted more specifically to
children, has become one of the hottest video sellers ever --
and dealers can't get enough copies.
   Disney and other movie studios and distributors are still
struggling to get a handle on the unpredictable
"sell-through" market -- selling movies on video directly to
consumers for $15 to $30, rather than to video stores mainly
for rental at $80 to $90. The market has grown in recent
years, but only certain kinds of titles -- chiefly those with
big box-office sales and strong kid appeal -- appear suited
to home sale. Even then, costs are higher and success much
harder to predict than in the rental market. And launching a
video outside the Christmas season makes for an even bigger
gamble.
   "There will always be aberrations, but I believe
sell-through is a seasonal business," says Paul Culberg,
executive vice president of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video,
a joint venture of units of General Electric Co. and Sony
Corp. Even at Christmas, he adds, "there's a large risk
factor." Mr. Culberg passed up the chance to go the
sell-through route with the recent video releases of
"Ghostbusters II" and "Look Who's Talking," even though each
grossed more than $100 million at the box office and
"Ghostbusters" had strong appeal to children.
   H. Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment
Corp., says: "Our experience is that people just aren't
buying anything except exercise, kids', music and
instructional videos." He adds that sell-through represents
only 10% of the chain's revenue and hasn't hit the 15% he had
budgeted for.
   Though industry officials say there hasn't been any major
sell-through release that lost money, reports abound of
warehouses groaning with unsold videocassettes. Tom Adams of
Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., consulting firm,
estimates returns of about two million units for each of last
Christmas's big three releases: Warner Bros.' "Batman" and
Disney's "Bambi" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." John Taylor,
president of Ingram Video Inc., a big Nashville, Tenn.,
distributor, says, "`Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' is coming back
to us in the thousands."
   But the lure of finding big sellers like "E.T.: The
Extraterrestrial" keeps studios coming back. They know that
eventually the fast-growing rental market will reach a
saturation point. A recent A.C. Nielsen survey indicated that
per-household rentals dropped in 1989 from three years
earlier, even though overall rentals continued to climb
because more households had videocassette recorders. (Now 70%
of households own VCRs.)
   But video specialty stores such as Blockbuster aren't
worried, saying that while mom-and-pop video shops may be
hurting, business is booming at the larger chains.
RCA/Columbia's Mr. Culberg agrees. "The rental business is
still strong," he says. Renting "just isn't the hot toy it
was a few years ago. Now it's found its place as another
element in a mix of entertainment."
   Suppliers say there's every reason to think there are
untapped reserves of rental and sell-through customers out
there. "There's a whole generation of children in this
country who don't remember life without a VCR," says Louis
Feola, executive vice president of MCA/Universal Home Video.
"It's like the way people in the '50s and the '60s felt about
television." And after that, there's always the laser disk,
once the price of its hardware comes down.
   Proponents of sell-through also talk about pride of
ownership among a nation of collectors, comparing
videocassettes to hardcover books, which are as expensive as
tapes and probably don't get much more use. At least so far,
however, most consumers haven't developed a collector's
mentality about videos: Alexander &amp; Associates, a New York
consulting firm, estimates that for each sale in today's
market, there are 14 rental transactions.
   Sell-through has been a fairly common practice for some
older films packaged to sop up extra cash. Paramount
Communications Inc.'s Paramount Pictures unit last month
announced plans to add "Fatal Attraction," "Heaven Can Wait"
and about 45 other titles to its sell-through video library,
priced at $14.95 each.
   But with many titles, the sell-through market has become a
critical source of revenue. Paramount's 1987 release of "Top
Gun," the first movie to sell several million copies on
video, ushered in a new era by bringing in an estimated $50
million from sales to consumers. MCA Inc.'s Universal
Pictures released "E.T." for Christmas 1988 and reaped an
estimated $200 million in revenue.
   Still, the sell-through market is tricky. Warner's "Lethal
Weapon 2" had the third-highest box-office sales of any movie
last year. Executives at Warner Home Video thought that would
translate into a hot title for videocassette sales despite
its R rating, and about 2.5 million copies hit store shelves
in February. It nearly sold out, but analysts say it would
have generated the same revenue in the rental market, selling
about 400,000 cassettes at $85 each to dealers. "We made more
money," says Warner Home Video chief Warren Lieberfarb, "by a
slight amount."
   Selling films on video often requires a shift of
perspective. Box-office success doesn't translate into video
sales so readily as into rentals. "Video is still viewed by
some studio executives and by retailers -- many of whom are
unsophisticated -- as an extension of theatrical box office,"
says Bruce Apar, editor of Video Business magazine. But "it
has to be looked at as something separate."
   Marketing movies costs more in the sell-through market
than in rentals. Studios have to court consumers directly
with expensive television commercials rather than merely woo
video store owners with mailers. Industry estimates place the
marketing budget for "The Little Mermaid" at $20 million,
though Disney says that's high. Then there's the cost of
producing perhaps six million to 10 million cassettes for
sale, rather than 500,000 or so to rent; at $3 or $4 a
cassette, the increased numbers further reduce profit
margins.
   Disney took a new strategy with "Mermaid," shipping fewer
units initially and counting on steady re-orders rather than
pressuring dealers to load up with a large number of units
right away. "They're priming the pump rather than flooding
the market and waiting for bad news later," says Mr. Adams,
the Paul Kagan analyst.
   Parents have snapped up "Mermaid" so quickly during its
first few weeks in stores that Disney officials think it
could become the company's best-selling video ever by year
end, and maybe even second overall to "E.T." Disney home
video chief Bill Mechanic says the company already has
shipped more than seven million copies of the video. "We have
a tremendous amount of reorders already," even though the
cassette only went on sale May 18, he adds. He predicts
"Mermaid" will sell 8.5 million to 10 million units by year
end, with virtually no returns.
   Disney calls the animated film a "classic," though it just
made its debut in theaters last year. "Mermaid" doesn't have
the usual big promotional tie-in with a consumer-products
company, but Disney is making its largest purchase of network
TV time ever to advertise a video. It's also offering
consumers a $3 rebate from the suggested retail price of
$26.99. Some stores, especially large discount chains, have
priced "Mermaid" well under $20.
   Disney released "Mermaid" early so it wouldn't clash with
its planned Christmas release of "Peter Pan," though the
company has promised retailers a second "Mermaid" marketing
push for Christmas. Then Disney will yank the video off
shelves and put the film away for seven years, after which it
will join the rotation of "Disney classics" rereleased in
theaters.
   The next "sure thing" in the sell-through market will be
released in mid-October, when Live Entertainment Inc. ships
to stores at least five million copies of "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," which has grossed more than $121 million at
the box office. "It's got all the elements," says David
Mount, president and chief executive of Live Entertainment's
IVE home video unit. "We think it's going to be the biggest
video title of the year."
   Even Mr. Culberg, the sell-through skeptic from
RCA/Columbia, says: "If I had `Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'
I'd do it in a second."
