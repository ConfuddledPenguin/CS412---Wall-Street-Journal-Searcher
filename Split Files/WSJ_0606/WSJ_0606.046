   WASHINGTON -- The House passed by voice vote a bill that
would increase the Securities and Exchange Commission's power
to gather Wall Street data and that includes a
program-trading measure opposed by the Bush administration.
   The bill, largely sponsored by the SEC, is partly a
reaction to the market drops of October 1987 and October 1989
and to the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

   The House's Securities Markets Reform Act will have to be
reconciled with a version pending in the Senate, which
contains no provision on program trading. The provision,
pushed by Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), would allow the SEC
to battle against activities that the agency has previously
deemed as producing unhealthy stock-market gyrations.
   Earlier forms of the legislation had broader
program-trading language, but Rep. Markey toned it down in an
effort to push the measure through his securities
subcommittee and eventually through the House. "We are not
talking about banning computers or legitimate program-trading
strategies," Rep. Markey said. "We are giving the SEC the
tools to protect the securities markets from manipulative
trading strategies."
   Moreover, the measure would give the SEC the power "to
constrain during volatile markets legitimate trading
strategies which nonetheless result in extraordinary
volatility."
   The Treasury Department, which repeatedly tried to derail
the program-trading provision, has called it "overly broad
and potentially harmful." At a briefing yesterday, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady reiterated his opposition to the
provision, saying, "I see no reason to change." Senate-House
discussions are likely to focus on how to narrow the
provision into something the opponents can live with.
   The bill would enable the SEC to gather information on the
holding companies of brokerage firms, an area where the
agency had complained of a blind spot. The SEC has argued,
for example, that Drexel Burnham's brokerage unit, over which
the agency has oversight, was sending capital to the unit's
holding company, which is exempt from SEC jurisdiction. The
SEC said it was difficult to assess the health of the parent
and other holding companies that invest heavily in short-term
financings of leveraged buy-outs.
   The bill also would allow the SEC to monitor stock trading
by large investors. Furthermore, the agency would be
permitted, for the first time, to halt stock-exchange trading
in an emergency if the president didn't oppose such a move.
Currently, only the president can halt trading of the overall
market.
