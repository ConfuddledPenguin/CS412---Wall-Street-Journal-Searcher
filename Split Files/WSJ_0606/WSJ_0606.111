   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co., a photographic,
chemical and pharmaceutical company, said it completed the
sale of its Charlotte, N.C.-based Verbatim Corp. subsidiary,
which makes and distributes floppy disks, to Mitsubishi Kasei
Corp. of Japan. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Analysts had estimated that Kodak would receive between
$190 million and $200 million for Verbatim. Kodak paid $175
million when it bought the business in 1985. Verbatim had
been marginally profitable for Kodak.
