   WASHINGTON -- Amid warnings that U.S. businesses are
losing markets to foreign competitors, the House approved
legislation that would provide partial antitrust protection
to certain joint production ventures.
   The bill, approved by a voice vote, would limit the
potential antitrust liability of participants in joint
production ventures who voluntarily disclose their activities
to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. Those
agencies share responsibility for enforcing federal antitrust
laws.

   In exchange for such notification, the participants would
be potentially liable only for "actual damages" associated
with their disclosed activities in any antitrust suit brought
against them. Under current law, such joint venture
participants face the threat of triple damages if they are
found to have violated antitrust laws.
   Although relatively few joint production ventures among
rival companies have been attacked on antitrust grounds,
"there appears to be an overdrawn, yet real, perception in
the business community that the antitrust laws generally
discourage all collaborative activity," said Rep. Jack Brooks
(D., Texas), who sponsored the bill. He said his measure was
designed to correct that inaccurate perception.
   The Brooks bill would reaffirm that multicompany
cooperative production efforts don't necessarily violate
antitrust laws and that courts must consider their potential
economic benefits in determining whether they are violations.
The legislation wouldn't apply to joint marketing and
distribution ventures.
   Some U.S. companies, especially in such high-technology
fields as semiconductors, contend that they need to pool
resources in joint ventures to compete effectively against
government-sponsored industrial combines in other nations,
including Japan. The Bush administration and lobbyists for
several high-technology industries have expressed strong
support for antitrust protection for joint production
ventures.
   But similar legislation is expected to face stiff
opposition in the Senate, led by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio), who heads the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Mr.
Metzenbaum argues that U.S. companies are more likely to
succeed internationally if tough antitrust laws force them to
be more competitive at home. He has tentatively scheduled
subcommittee hearings on the Senate bill for July.
   The Brooks bill would extend to production ventures the
protection a 1984 law provided to joint research ventures.
The production legislation differs from the earlier law in
one significant way, however: It would protect only ventures
in which foreign participants have no more than 30% control.
In addition, it would require that all facilities operated by
ventures receiving protection be located within the U.S. or
its territories.
   Foreign investors and the Bush administration have
criticized the 30% limitation as discouraging international
cooperation. Mr. Brooks countered that his bill would create
"no special substantive antitrust treatment for
American-dominated" ventures. "The only advantage received by
a qualifying venture," he added, "is that its participants
will receive reduced liability exposure if their disclosed
activities are found to be anti-competitive."
