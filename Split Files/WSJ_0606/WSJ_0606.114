   Manville Corp., Denver, said its Manville Forest Products
unit completed the acquisition of Fiskeby Board AB from
Kooporativa Forbundet.
   Terms of the cash transaction weren't disclosed. However,
Manville said the Swedish supplier of recycled and coated
boxboard products had 1989 sales of about $65 million.

   Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it put Manville's
senior debt and preferred stock ratings on CreditWatch with
negative implications, following a joint court ruling
ordering the company to return to federal bankruptcy court to
reconsider the funding of a trust established to pay asbestos
claims.
   The rating concern said its move could affect about $220
million in senior unsecured debt, currently rated double-B;
and preferred stock, currently rated single-B-plus.
   Late last week, a U.S. district judge and a New York state
judge gave the forest and building products company five
weeks to consider revisions to the trust with the U.S.
bankruptcy court judge.
