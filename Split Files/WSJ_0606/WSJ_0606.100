   Kloeckner-Werke AG, said it is buying a British-owned
plastics company and is close to selling its Mannstaedt steel
unit to British Steel PLC.
   The West German steel, plastics and machinery group said
it has agreed to buy Eurotec Systemteile G.m.b.H., a maker of
moulded parts for the auto industry, from B.A.T Industries
PLC for 270 million marks ($160.2 million). Kloeckner-Werke
also is taking over about 180 million marks of debt in the
transaction.

Kloeckner-Werke is close to concluding the sale of Mannstaedt
to British Steel for about 300 million marks. That's in line
with the company's continuing efforts to reduce dependence on
steel, once its core business area.
