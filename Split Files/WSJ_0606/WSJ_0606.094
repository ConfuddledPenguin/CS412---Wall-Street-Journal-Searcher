   Kubota Ltd., a Japanese maker of farm equipment and
ductile iron pipes, announced that despite a 14% gain in net
sales, consolidated pretax profit fell 29% in fiscal 1989 to
31.85 billion yen ($209.3 million) from 45.12 billion yen.
   Net sales rose 14% in the year ended March 31 to 821.88
billion yen from 721.39 billion yen.

   Many of the newly consolidated subsidiaries posted strong
sales growth, contributing to the net sales gain.
   But operating profit was knocked down 15% by higher sales,
administrative and general expenses, to 36.31 billion yen
from 42.55 billion yen.
   Higher depreciation costs, caused by expanded production
facilities, cut into sales income as well, Kubota said.
   Net income tumbled 59% to 7.60 billion yen from 18.43
billion yen.
   Kubota cited losses from higher interest rates,
foreign-exchange losses and increased costs for starting new
businesses, such as computer-related fields through its
subsidiaries, for the plunge in net.
