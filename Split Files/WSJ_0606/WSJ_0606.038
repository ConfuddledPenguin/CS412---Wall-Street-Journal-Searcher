   Businessland Inc., the biggest U.S. dealer of personal
computers, is moving into Japan with the help of four of that
country's biggest electronics concerns.
   The company plans to announce today that it is forming a
Japanese subsidiary and that Canon Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., Sony
Corp. and Toshiba Corp. have each taken a 5% stake in the
venture. Softbank Corp., a distributor of software and
computer peripherals in Japan, is taking 26% of the company,
leaving Businessland with 54%.

   Businessland's entry into Japan is part of its continuing
effort to expand abroad after a decade of rapid growth in the
U.S. In 1987, the San Jose, Calif.-based company bought a
computer retailer in the U.K.; this year, it bought one in
West Germany, and it is looking to purchase a dealer in
France.
   Still, the Japanese market presents different problems
from Europe, where demand for personal computers is outpacing
that in the U.S. Only a tiny percentage of Japanese use
computers at work. Moreover, many U.S. retailers fear that
Japanese customs and entrenched local retailers limit their
access to Japan's estimated $3 billion market for personal
computers.
   Though the stakes are high, Businessland's Japanese
subsidiary plans to start small, with a capitalization of $20
million, a lone Tokyo office and 14 employees (rising to 100
by year end).
   The caution is wise; selling personal computers in Japan
can be perilous for outsiders. In addition to an extensive
network of local computer dealers in Japan, there is no
single standard -- as in the U.S. -- around which virtually
all hardware and software revolves.
   Few other U.S. dealers have tried to crack Japan's tough
market. Among Businessland's major U.S. rivals, only
Computerland Inc. has a presence in Japan, but its roughly 30
stores are owned and operated by Japanese nationals, who
purchased the operation from Computerland in 1987. Also,
Businessland faces competition from Otsuka Shokai, a major
Japanese personal-computer dealer.
   David Norman, Businessland's chief executive, believes he
will partly overcome the market's obstacles with help from
the Japanese partners. The arrangement is "an example of
Japanese companies helping American companies compete in
their marketplace," he said. "It gives us a lot of
credibility from the very beginning."
   "I think the opportunity for success for an American
dealer entering Japan is slim and none," said Michael
Shabazian, president and chief operating officer of
Intelligent Electronics Inc., which operates about 900
franchise computer dealerships in the U.S. "I think Japan
would be a very difficult market."
   Each of the big electronics concerns, for instance, will
supply Businessland with a variety of their computers,
printers and other products to sell. However, Businessland --
at least at first -- won't offer some of the bellwether
products it sells in the U.S., most notably equipment from
Hewlett-Packard Co., Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer
Corp. Businessland will carry products made by International
Business Machines Co., its biggest sales producer in the U.S.
   Mr. Norman said what brands Businessland would carry
wasn't a precondition for receiving investments from Canon,
Toshiba, Fujitsu and Sony.
   Besides gaining a new outlet for their wares, the Japanese
electronics firms are hoping that Businessland's emphasis on
tying together computers and related products from different
manufacturers will stimulate demand for office-automation
equipment.
   "The trend in the U.S. and Europe of integrated networking
and end-user computing is now appearing in Japanese
corporations," said Tadishi Sekizawa, Fujitsu's executive
director. "Businessland's experience . . . will be very
valuable to Japanese companies as they experience this change
in their computing environment."
   For its part, Businessland hopes the deal will give it an
inside track with Japanese corporate buyers of computers.
   "Historically, Japanese corporations have invested heavily
in automation to increase productivity in the factory, then
in research and development labs," Keizo Yamaji, Canon's
president, said in a statement. "We feel the next big
opportunity will be in the office."
   Businessland at first plans to gain a foothold in Japan by
catering to the numerous foreign multinationals doing
business there. But in the long run, it wants to act as a
spur toward standardization among personal-computer parts.
The lack of standardization limits customer choices as
manufacturers can't agree on common specifications. With four
of Japan's biggest electronics companies -- all major
computer and peripheral makers -- joining to back
Businessland, this could change.
   "My goal is to convince manufacturers to closely work
together and help the customer," said Reizo Harada, president
of Businessland's Japanese subsidiary, who has worked with
U.S. computer makers in Japan for the past 29 years. "If we
are successful, we can create momentum for standards here."
   Businessland shares closed at $9, up 50 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
