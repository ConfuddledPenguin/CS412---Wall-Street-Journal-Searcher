   NL Industries Inc., Houston, said its Kronos International
Inc. unit, based in Leverkusen, West Germany, signed a
seven-year term-loan agreement for 1.6 billion marks ($945.6
million), which will be used for debt repayment and other
corporate purposes.
   The specialty chemicals concern, which is controlled by
the Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, last year used
proceeds from a loan denominated in marks in part to buy
substantial stakes in Lockheed Corp. and Georgia Gulf Corp.

   An executive with Mr. Simmons's holding company, Valhi
Inc., said the loan, which matures in June 1997, will
increase NL's cash position by about $200 million, some of
which will be used for NL's new Lake Charles, La., chemical
plant. The proceeds also will be used to repay about $602
million of existing West German mark financing. Kronos
generates about 55% of the company's sales and a substantial
amount of its cash flow.
   The bank group is led by Hypobank International S.A. and
Banque Paribas.
