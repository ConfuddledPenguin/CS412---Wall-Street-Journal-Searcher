   Bowne &amp; Co., New York, reported a doubling of net income
for its fiscal first quarter on a sales increase of 18%,
citing the loss of two competitors and a "modest" increase in
demand for financial printing.
   Net income for the quarter ended April 30 was $4.3
million, or 25 cents a share, up from $2.2 million, or 12
cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter when there were
more shares outstanding. Sales were $57.5 million, compared
with $48.5 million.

   For the fiscal six months, earnings were $5.4 million, or
31 cents a share, compared with $2.7 million, or 15 cents a
share. Sales were $100.1 million, up 10% from $90.8 million.
Average shares outstanding decreased to about 17.2 million,
from about 18.1 million a year earlier.
   President Richard H. Koontz, in a statement, said
"consolidation in the financial printing industry became more
apparent during recent months with the disappearance of two
of our major competitors." In the past year, Sorg Inc. and
Charles P. Young Co. filed for bankruptcy-court protection
from creditors. Late last month, Bowne completed a previously
announced purchase of some Sorg assets, including the Sorg
name and trademark and some equipment, for $5.7 million.
   Bowne shares closed yesterday at $13, up $1.50, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading.
