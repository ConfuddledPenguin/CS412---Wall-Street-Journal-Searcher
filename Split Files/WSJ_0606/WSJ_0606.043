   WARSAW -- In Washington, London, or Moscow nowadays,
Poland's economic reform is often described as a miracle.
People make favorable comparisons between Poland and other
new East Bloc democracies; they praise Poland too in
discussions of what must be done in the Soviet Union. Seen
from Warsaw, though, Poland's "shock treatment" looks like
the kind of reform communist regimes used to announce. Poles
recognize it for what it is: a price rise without structural
changes. Change won't come until Poland makes basic switches
in its program.
   The reform constructed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government
with the aid of foreigners such as Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs
has emphasized control of demand rather than freeing supply.
To increase production, Poland needs to untie private
business and encourage foreign investment. The government has
done little to provide the low-tax, uncomplicated environment
in which businesses can grow. Instead, it is playing around
with such macroeconomic issues as the money supply and
interest rates. As a result, half a year into reform, Poland
has yet to produce items anyone would want to buy. None of
Poland's big, inefficient state enterprises -- not even the
Lenin Shipyards -- has gone bankrupt.

   At the year's start, the Polish government cut or
abolished most consumer subsidies. It raised interest rates
to a rate that cut chronic borrowing. It set a single rate
for zloty convertibility. It set about preventing wage
increases via prohibitive taxes -- the marginal price of
labor to employers rises sharply when wages hit a certain
level. The predictable happened: Prices rose and real income
fell nearly overnight. Hyperinflation disappeared -- people
could no longer buy anything. Imports slowed and exports
grew. Poland now boasts a growing trade surplus and a
relatively stable currency.
   But fierce recession also grips the country. Some figures
show a drop in production of 30% from last year. Monetary and
fiscal reforms cannot force state monopolies to act like
private companies. Faced with lower demand and forced to pay
real interest rates for the first time, Poland's state
enterprises have mostly decided to make fewer items and
charge higher prices for them. Nothing is forcing them to
cease acting like state enterprises.
   Business conditions discourage growth of both domestic
private enterprise and foreign business. Most of the old
legal system is still in place. Tax law dictates extremely
high levels of turnover tax (the tax companies pay on all
business), about 20%. The law also keeps labor costs
prohibitive by requiring firms to pay social security tax of
about 40% of wages. Property laws are unclear. The phony
cooperatives that shouldn't be controlling retail space still
do; the property developers who want to buy land still
cannot. Commercial law is overcomplicated. Oldstyle
bureaucrats still control the issue of business licenses.
   For foreign companies, exchange controls continue to make
repatriation of profits problematic. Most foreign companies
still do business in hard currency. To retrieve their money,
companies must exchange any profits earned in hard currency
for zlotys, and then exchange them for hard currency, a
two-step process wasting time and money. High duties on many
products discourage imports. Wage limitations dictated by the
reform also prevent foreign companies from competing for
workers. A survey of Warsaw's luxury hotels reveals that the
alleged capitalists flocking here are mainly looking to
provide services to business or invest in tourism.
Manufacturing flounders.
   Despite its vaunted free-market liberalism, the Polish
reform is still not radical enough. Rather than supporting
the notion of "equality for all enterprises, private and
state" -- the stated goal of the last communist government --
Poland needs to create conditions of inequality. Private
enterprise should be actively favored, while state
enterprise, with some exceptions, should be forced to fight
for survival. Foreign competition should be encouraged at the
expense of Polish monopolists.
   The solutions are not complicated. They include legal
reform -- making business easier to start and property easier
to buy; tax reform that would give advantage to private
enterprise with lower rates; bank lending policies that do
the same; elimination of controls over foreign trade.
   The trouble is that 90% of Polish industrial production
remains in state hands, while farms remain dependent on state
institutions. This immense state sector continues to
monopolize most resources in order to produce shoddy goods.
Most people still depend on the state in some way and resist
change. Fast privatization of state enterprises, from food
distribution to steel mills, is critical.
   Yet Poland's privatization program is on hold. It is on
this issue that society's resistance to change, at least as
reflected in its parliamentary representatives, is most
obvious. When it was written, a bill that would allow the
central government to enforce privatization was criticized as
"too cautious." Now, even this bill is stuck in Parliament.
Left-leaning deputies argue it would deprive workers of their
"rights" -- and their jobs. Right-leaning deputies claim
assets would be valued too low, allowing foreigners -- read
Germans -- to buy up Poland. Meantime, Poland faces the
prospect of more recession.
   As long as recession looms, shortages, panic-buying and
inflation will continue to haunt this society. Last month
Poland celebrated two national holidays, on May 1 and May 3.
By May 4, there was no bread in the shops and lines snaked
outside and around corners again. Whether from absence of
competition or simply left-over sluggishness, state bakers
had not found it worth their while to work on May 2.
   The desire to produce -- the instinct to compete -- has
not yet received the oxygen it needs. No amount of
pro-capitalism rhetoric will revive it; only capitalist
practice will do.
