   NEW YORK -- Beleaguered William Farley, chairman of Fruit
of the Loom Inc., has sold $7.3 million of stock in the
Chicago-based underwear, socks and sweatshirt company since
March, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
show.
   In addition, according to a "notice of proposed sale"
filed with the SEC on May 15, Mr. Farley planned to sell as
much as $3.9 million more of Fruit of the Loom stock. The
Form 144 notice said he would sell as many as 280,500 shares
"ASAP" (as soon as possible).

   The sales come at a time when Farley Inc., the highly
leveraged holding company in which Mr. Farley is the majority
stockholder, is tottering under its mountain of debt. Farley
Inc. holds a 20% stake in Fruit of the Loom.
   Mr. Farley declined to be interviewed for this article,
and the company declined to confirm SEC figures. A
spokeswoman said Mr. Farley sold for "personal reasons," and
added that he "expects another record-setting year for Fruit
of the Loom."
   The sales, both past and planned, represent 38% of Mr.
Farley's personal common A stockholdings in the company,
according to SEC filings. They show he also holds an
additional 15.2 million common B shares, which are
exchangeable for common A shares at the rate of 1-to-1.
   Mr. Farley sold 555,000 shares at $12.88 to $13.75 a share
between March 23 and the end of April, the SEC filings show.
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange
yesterday, Fruit of the Loom shares closed at $13.75, down 25
cents.
   Analysts said the sales reflect more negatively on Farley
Inc., and Mr. Farley's own need for cash for his other
troubled businesses, than on Fruit of the Loom. The question
for investors, they said, is whether Farley's stake in Fruit
of the Loom will enable the company to remain insulated from
Farley Inc.'s serious debt problems.
   Farley Inc. acquired West Point-Pepperell Inc., the sheet
and towel manufacturer, after a bitter and costly battle
early last year. Technically, however, the leveraged buy-out
was never completed. In March of this year, Farley defaulted
on $1.5 billion in debt and then offered to relinquish a
majority stake in West Point if bondholders would agree to
less attractive bond yields and deferred payments.
Negotiations with bondholders and Farley's lenders continue.
   As for Fruit of the Loom, for the first quarter, the
company reported earnings of $12.8 million, or 20 cents a
share, compared with $7.7 million, or 12 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Paul Shaum, high-yield bond analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc., who tracks Fruit of the Loom's $504 million of junk
debt (and the $1.2 billion of junk securities sold by Farley
and West Point Acquisition Corp.), said Fruit of the Loom's
growth has been "phenomenal." Its sportswear division in
particular has benefited from the "active health kick in the
country."

   LITTLE GULPS: In May, nine insiders at restaurant-chain
Wendy's International Inc. bought between 300 and 10,000
shares each. Their purchases followed larger purchases by the
company's chairman and by its president last February. In
fact, so far this year, 17 Wendy's insiders have purchased
its stock, a total of 119,100 shares, SEC filings show.
   The insiders paid prices ranging from $4 to $4.88 a share,
the SEC filings show. The stock has since risen, closing
yesterday at $6, up 25 cents, in composite New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   A recent increase in profitability as measured in
operating earnings is one reason company insiders have
confidence, said spokesman Dennis Lynch, who bought 1,000
shares in February. He also cited Wendy's advertising
campaign, which features TV commercials with Chairman R.
David Thomas.
   In general, the insiders who bought in May only nibbled,
each of them spending $47,500 or less on the shares. But
three of the insiders were first-time buyers and, for most of
the others, their small purchases represented a substantial
increase in their current holdings. The largest recent
purchase was made by Director James V. Pickett, chief
executive officer of Pickett Cos., based in Columbus, Ohio.
He purchased 10,000 shares at $4.75 a share, increasing his
total holdings to 42,271 shares. He couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In February, President James W. Near bought 40,000 shares,
boosting his holdings to 546,820 shares. In the same month,
Mr. Thomas purchased 29,800 shares, raising his total
holdings to 7.4 million shares. Mr. Near declined to comment,
and Mr. Thomas couldn't be reached for comment.

   CHEMISTRY SET: Two prominent directors of New York-based
banking conglomerate Chemical Banking Corp. bought its shares
in April and May, SEC filings show. Their purchases were
small, but they bring to six the number of insiders who have
purchased Chemical stock through the middle of last month,
compared with four insiders in all of 1989.
   Paul A. Funkhouser, former president of CSX Corp., bought
1,000 shares at $23.75 each on April 26. The purchase
increased his total holdings to 7,044 shares, according to
SEC filings. On May 14, Lawrence G. Rawl, the chairman of
Exxon Corp., also bought 1,000 shares. He paid $26.25 a
share, bringing his total direct and indirect holdings to
1,790 shares, SEC filings show. Mr. Funkhouser was out of his
office and unable to comment; a spokeswoman for Exxon said
Mr. Rawl's purchase was "a personal move."
   The other four insiders who bought earlier this year
purchased between 120 and 5,000 shares each, according to
insider filings, increasing their holdings by 16% to 152%.
   Chemical's stock has continued to rise, closing yesterday
on the New York Stock Exchange at $28.75 a share, up 37.5
cents. The stock has climbed despite bearishness on the part
of the rating concerns. In late April and early May, Moody's
Investors Services Inc. downgraded the credit ratings of
Chemical Banking Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries,
including Chemical Bank, in addition to the debt ratings of
80 transactions backed by letters of credit from Chemical.
