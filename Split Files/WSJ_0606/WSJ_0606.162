   LONDON -- More bad news hit Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. as it
reported a #7 million ($11.8 million) net loss for its fiscal
first half and, for the first time, skipped its interim
dividend.
   The beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant
blamed the persistent red ink on higher debt levels, the
advertising slowdown in the United Kingdom and losses from
its consulting business. And Saatchi may be unable to resume
paying a dividend on its ordinary shares before fiscal 1991,
Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, indicated in an
interview here. "It's more important for me to reduce our
debt than pay our dividend," said the French-born executive
who took the Saatchi helm in January.

   In a more positive sign, Saatchi yesterday reached
tentative agreement on the long-awaited management buy-out of
its Hay Group unit. About 128 partners of the
Philadelphia-based consulting firm, along with certain
institutional investors, would pay Saatchi $80 million in
cash plus a $10 million note. The sale would nearly complete
Saatchi's pullback from management consulting, a field it
once vowed to dominate world-wide. Analysts believe the
diversification strategy flopped because Saatchi overpaid for
the businesses and took on a crushing load of debt.
   Saatchi has said the sale of Hay and five other consulting
businesses should reduce debt, otherwise expected to average
#260 million, by reaping #80 million in the year ending Sept.
30. In addition, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus insisted that layoffs and
other cost-cutting efforts have begun to lower Saatchi's high
overhead costs. He said cash flow turned positive April 1.
   But some analysts contend Saatchi may need two years to
return to profitability and three years to unload its heavy
debt. "They are going to have problems for a long time," said
James Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest Securities in
New York. Agreed analyst Brian Sturgess of London securities
house Barclays de Zoete Wedd: "I think there is worse to
come."
   Investors nevertheless ignored the larger-than-expected
net loss, which followed Saatchi's first-ever net loss in
fiscal 1989, and instead reacted positively to the Hay
accord. Saatchi shares rose six pence to 107 pence ($1.81) in
late trading on London's Stock Exchange. The once high-flying
Saatchi share price has tumbled more than 60% from its 1990
high point.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Saatchi's
American depositary shares rose 37.5 cents to $5.625.
   For the first half of fiscal 1989, Saatchi paid an interim
dividend of 7.4 pence on ordinary shares and then slashed its
final dividend for the second half of fiscal 1989 to 1.6
pence.
   Pretax profit in the six months ended March 31 slid 29% to
#14.4 million from #20.2 million a year earlier, which was
close to analysts' projections. The latest figures include an
extraordinary gain of #2.4 million, representing a #4.7
million profit from selling works of art and #2.3 million in
costs from merging and closing small European operations. The
year-earlier period had an exceptional charge of #2.7 million
from reorganization costs.
   Revenue during the first half rose 12% to #505 million
from #451.3 million. Saatchi's #7 million net loss compared
with profit of #1.5 million, or a penny a share, in the same
1989 period.
   Saatchi said its consulting unit had a "disappointing"
performance, posting a #700,000 operating loss, compared with
operating profit of #8 million in fiscal 1989. The unit's
revenue slid 3% to #115 million. "The decision to sell these
businesses has had an adverse impact on profit performance,"
the company said.
   The proposed Hay sale involves management and
institutional investors led by CIN Venture Managers Ltd., a
big U.K. venture-capital group. The deal would come with some
strings attached: Saatchi said the $10 million subordinated
note has "uncertain" value and that it agreed to pay as much
as $9 million of the purchasers' expenses.
   The Hay sale "has come through for less than what was
hoped," said David Forster, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson
Securities in London. But "they {Saatchi} wanted to get out
of consulting."
   When Saatchi put its dozen or so consulting businesses on
the block a year ago, analysts figured the units would fetch
between #250 million and #350 million. The company also had
hoped to complete the sales by last fall. But the impression
that Saatchi was holding a fire sale severely hurt prices. So
did recent problems in financial markets, which made it
difficult for buyers to raise financing.
   Counting projected sale proceeds and the retained
market-research business, Saatchi probably will recoup about
half of the #250 million spent on its flawed consulting
diversification. "Clearly, we're still looking at a
significant loss" from the investment, a second Saatchi
official said.
   Operating profit in the communications unit, which
includes advertising and other marketing services, increased
a hefty 40% to #31 million, while revenue advanced 17% to
#390 million. But favorable currency movements and transfer
of the market-research operation to the unit inflated the
revenue figure.
   Saatchi is facing a much harsher advertising climate in
Britain than in the U.S. Its U.K. communications business
suffered a nearly 4% drop in first-half revenue, compared
with a roughly 8.2% revenue gain in the U.S. at constant
exchange rates. The British unit's operating profit was
"basically break-even" during the period, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus
reported, down from #3.5 million in the first six months of
fiscal 1989.
   "The problem is that the {U.K.} clients aren't spending
what they said they would when we did our budget last year,"
he added. But "we have every indication that we will be
solidly profitable in the U.K. for the {full} year."
   Mr. Louis-Dreyfus also stressed that he wants to improve
profit margins for Saatchi's main competing international
advertising groups, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising and Backer
Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. He hinted, however that he might
someday consider selling one ad network, a profit-revival
strategy advocated by some analysts.
   "I have no intention at the present time to sell a
network," he said. "But I will do anything I have to do to be
able to refinance" a European convertible preference issue
coming due in 1993. Otherwise, the issue could cost Saatchi
as much as #211 million when it comes due.
   Saatchi also disclosed that a U.S. fund manager, New
York-based Tweedy Browne Co., has acquired a 4.08% stake,
which will lift the proportion of shares held by U.S. holders
to 38% from 34%.

   Lowe U.S. Agency Merger
                                                                                                       

   Lowe International merged its two U.S. ad agencies, Lowe
Marschalk and Lowe Tucker Metcalf.
   In combining the two shops' operations, Lowe said it would
rename the agency Lowe &amp; Partners. Lowe International, part
of Lowe Group, said it was "a logical time to combine
forces," having recently acquired total ownership of Lowe
Marschalk.
   Interpublic Group last year swapped its interest in Lowe
Marschalk for a larger interest in Lowe Group; it now owns
35.4% of Lowe Group.
   Andrew J. Langer, Lowe Marschalk's chief executive
officer, will retain that post at the newly named shop. David
Metcalf and Dennis D'Amico, both of Lowe Tucker, were named
joint creative directors. Lowe Marschalk, with billings of
about $300 million, serves clients including Prudential
Insurance and Coca-Cola. Lowe Tucker's billings are about $35
million.
