   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said it
intends to relax temporarily a new regulation that limits the
amount savings and loans may lend to an individual borrower.
   The move, which will ease the regulation for strongly
capitalized thrifts for the next year and a half, comes in
response to complaints by thrifts and the
housing-construction industry. They said the regulation was
forcing lenders to break off lending relationships with
economically sound projects.

   Ordered by Congress in last year's savings-and-loan
bailout law, the regulation originally flatly prevented any
institution from lending more than 15% of its capital to a
single borrower. But under a phase-in plan the thrift
regulation agency intends to propose in the next few weeks,
well-capitalized thrifts initially will be allowed to make
loans equal to as much as 60% of their capital to single
borrowers engaged in housing construction. The limit would be
reduced gradually to 15% by the end of 1991, said a
spokesman, confirming a report in the American Banker
newspaper.
   Only thrifts that currently meet 1995 capital standards
enacted in the bailout law will be allowed to make the larger
loans during the phase-in period. About 1,185 of the
country's thrifts currently meet those capital standards.
   Previously, thrifts could lend up to 100% of their capital
to single developers, even though their net worth would be
jeopardized if such a loan resulted in big losses.
