   Three members of Campbell Soup Co.'s controlling Dorrance
family who pressed for a sale of the company last winter
disclosed they pooled most of their 17.4% stake into a voting
trust. They also said their feelings about a sale are
"substantially unchanged."
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Dorrance Hamilton, Hope van Beuren, Diana Norris, and their
spouses said they "continue to believe that the best
interests of the shareholders would be served by a sale of
the company."

   Wall Street reacted sharply to the statements. In heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell shares rose
$3.375 to close at $60.
   The newly formed voting trust replaces an earlier trust
that included several other family members. The previous
trust was dissolved in December when the Dorrances publicly
split over the independence of the Camden, N.J., food
company.
   The latest filing threatens to reignite the family feud,
which pitched the three dissidents against the three children
of late family patriarch John T. "Jack" Dorrance Jr., with
three other family members in the middle. Jack Dorrance's
children control about 31.5% of the company. The other family
members have a combined 9.8% stake.
   In January, Campbell appointed a new chief executive
officer, David W. Johnson. The dissident shareholders agreed
then to suspend temporarily their drive for a sale to give
Mr. Johnson a chance to improve the company's mediocre
financial performance.
   In yesterday's filing, the dissidents said they support
Mr. Johnson's "strategic measures" to bolster returns. The
dissidents also said their latest call for a sale of Campbell
"does not reflect dissatisfaction" with the new chief.
   "But Mr. Johnson has clearly not embraced the sale of the
company as his objective," said Peter Haje, an attorney with
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, which represents
the three dissidents.
   The formation of the trust is "basically the formalization
of a situation that has existed for some months," added an
adviser to the group.
   A Campbell spokesman said the company's 15-member board,
which includes six family members, is committed to the
company's independence and sees no reason to change its
position. Mrs. Hamilton is considered the only acknowledged
dissident on the board.
