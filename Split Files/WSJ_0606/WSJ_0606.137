   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Exports in May fell 10.2% to US$5.64
billion -- the first double-digit decline since September
1988 -- and were off 1.05% from April, the government said.
   In the first five months of this year, exports totaled
US$26.59 billion, down 1% from a year earlier. Trade
officials cited mainly a stronger Taiwan dollar and rising
labor costs, which made locally manufactured products less
attractive to foreign buyers.

   Imports in May totaled US$4.38 billion, down 7.2% from a
year earlier. In the first five months, imports rose 5.5% to

   May's trade surplus was US$1.26 billion, down 19.3% from a
year earlier but up 60.76% from April. In the first five
months, Taiwan registered a surplus of US$3.84 billion, off
27.5% from a year earlier.
