   His colleagues in the army of the Honorable East India
Company called him the "White Nigger" and "that Devil
Burton." Edward Rice, his biographer, calls him "the paradigm
of the scholar-adventurer, a man who towered above others
physically and intellectually, a soldier, scientist, explorer
and writer." History remembers him as Captain Sir Richard
Francis Burton.
   He spoke 29 languages. He passed himself off as an Afghan,
a Gypsy laborer, a peddler of trinkets, a dervish and even a
diplomat. Tramping through such places as Uganda and the
Punjab, he was the ultimate undercover man in what Rudyard
Kipling called the "Great Game," the extension of Europe's
suzerainty over the unmapped expanses of Arabia, the Indian
subcontinent and Africa.

   Burton penetrated the dark, secretive lands of Britain's
colonies and helped nudge Victorian Britain toward a more
open view of sexual behavior. A sexual adventurer and
self-styled connoisseur of sensuality, he was a leading
figure in the translation of the Kama Sutra, something of a
Baedeker of the human body.
   To this subject Edward Rice has devoted much of his own
life. Over a period of 18 years and 10 trips to India and
Pakistan, Nepal, Iran, the Arab countries, Israel, Uganda and
Kenya, Mr. Rice spoke to yogis, Sufis, Sikhs, ranis,
maharajahs, sheiks, mahouts, Brahmans and half-castes. The
result is "Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton" (Scribner's,
522 pages, $35), surely the last word on the last great
explorer of the colonial age.
   As a young man Burton was half delinquent, half wiseacre,
the sort of annoying adolescent who angered the dons by
speaking the kind of Latin that Romans spoke rather than the
sort spewed out in the halls of Oxford. At Oxford he plunged
into the forbidding depths of the Kabbala, the medieval
Jewish mystical texts. Later he became sufficiently erudite
in Sufism to preach in the mosques of Sind and Baluchistan.
He was married in a Roman Catholic church.
   His family purchased him a commission in the army of the
Honorable East India Company and soon he set out to be a man
of lore and legend. With a face scarred by a spear wound he
received in a battle with Somali marauders that also cost him
four teeth, Burton was, as Mr. Rice puts it, "enamored of the
exotic, the unusual and the dangerous."
   Burton's greatest skill was his ability to go native. He
loved flowing muslin shirts and big, baggy trousers, felt
comfortable in a cotton skullcap (with 12 yards of ornamental
sprigged muslin wound around it to form a turban) and, in his
days as a Moslem dandy, wore soft slippers made from silk
flowers. "He tried disguises endlessly, like an actor working
out the shadings of a character," says Mr. Rice. "But this
was no act for Burton. If he said he was a Muslim, then he
was one."
   He lunged from enthusiasm to enthusiasm with a passion
unalloyed, applying it to falconry, to cock fighting, to the
abduction of nuns and orphans for sex, and to the love of a
13-year-old whom he described as the "high passion" of his
life. In his Sufi period he joined dervishes as they danced
to exhaustion and ecstasy and then toyed with glowing irons.
   He was convinced that "what might be perilous to other
travelers was safe to me," and set out on a pilgrimage to
Mecca -- a journey through dust, sand, hot winds and endless
emptiness that was, in Mr. Rice's estimation, "almost
madness." Though he envisioned himself a good Moslem, there
were certain deprivations he could not endure. One was the
lack of alcohol. And ignoring women was out of the question;
even during a three-hour sermon in Mecca he was distracted by
a tall girl with whom he flirted shamelessly.
   This sort of thing repeated itself without end. On his
journey to find the origin of the Nile he was stricken with
marsh fever, but at each village he still managed a female
conquest. He trumpeted the virtues of polygamy, arguing that
marriage to one woman was "the most curious delimitation of
human liberty ever forced upon mankind."
   Burton was a prolific writer; in a three-year period in
Africa he turned out nine volumes, each jammed with his
observations. He brought "The Arabian Nights" (with Aladdin
and Ali Baba) to the West and served (sometimes with
disastrous results) as a British consul in places as
disparate as Brazil and Trieste. He spoke out against slavery
and the ritual sacrifices of Dahomey but was equally
outspoken in his warnings to the British. "Everyone knows,"
he wrote as a young man, "that if the people of India could
be unanimous for a day they might sweep us from their country
as dust before a whirlwind."
   Today Burton would be regarded as a rootless boaster with
an identity crisis. But he was more than that, more than even
an undercover agent, roue and explorer. Mr. Rice helps us see
that Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton breached barriers,
not only in Europe's far-flung colonies but in England
itself. For all his excesses, some of them deplorable, Burton
was a man of adventure -- but his achievement (and Edward
Rice's) is that his adventures thrill us still.
