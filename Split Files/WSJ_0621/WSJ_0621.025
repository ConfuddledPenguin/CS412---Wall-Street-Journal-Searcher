   SMITH INTERNATIONAL Inc., a Houston-based energy services
concern, said that under a newly adopted stockholder rights
plan, it will distribute as a dividend one preferred-stock
purchase right for each common share held. The rights expire
June 19, 2000. The company said each right, when exercised,
entitles the holder to purchase 1/100th of a newly issued
share of Series A junior participating preferred at an
exercise price of $50. The rights become exercisable if a 20%
ownership stake in the company is acquired, among other
conditions. A spokeswoman said adoption of the plan wasn't a
response to any known takeover threats. Rights plans can be
used as a defense against a hostile bid by making an offer
more expensive.
