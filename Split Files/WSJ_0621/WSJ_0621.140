   A consortium of four foreign banks with a first mortgage
on Donald Trump's Trump Tower has emerged as a major
impediment to a $65 million loan package for the troubled
developer.
   The banks are unwilling to allow a second mortgage to be
placed on the property, according to people familiar with the
negotiations.

   The four banks are said to be Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi
Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Dresdner Bank. They purchased
portions of a $75 million loan issued by Chase Manhattan
Corp. to Mr. Trump. None of the four banks are believed to
own major portions of other loans to Mr. Trump, and,
therefore, would be otherwise unaffected if the bailout fell
through. Officials of the three Japanese banks and the West
German bank couldn't be reached.
   Chase has retained a portion of the loan and plans to meet
with the banks this morning to try to convince them that
"mutual cooperation is better for them, and without their
cooperation the deal doesn't work," said a person close to
the talks.
   Chase officials are also expected to learn whether the
banks are adamant or are merely posturing for better terms.
   Under a complicated bailout package prepared by Mr.
Trump's major creditors, the Trump Tower syndicate banks
would still receive interest payments and retain their first
mortgage, but they would have to share a second lien with the
rest of Mr. Trump's creditors.
   People close to the talks are said to believe that the
four syndicate banks apparently expect Chase or another U.S.
bank to buy out their share of the first mortgage loan.
Neither Chase nor any of Mr. Trump's other major U.S.
creditors -- Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp or
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. -- are expected to be willing to
put up more money to keep the $65 million loan package alive.
   The syndicate banks for New York's Trump Tower have always
been seen as stumbling blocks to the bailout because they are
fully secured and would bear less risk than many other
creditors should Mr. Trump have to file for bankruptcy-law
protection.
   Meanwhile, participants in Citicorp's loans, which include
about 54 institutions from around the world, were said to
have inched closer to accepting the package. Many of those
loans aren't well-secured by Mr. Trump's assets, and the
Citicorp creditors are said to believe they are better off
trying to help Mr. Trump avoid bankruptcy court.
   Among the additional banks said to have agreed are Bank of
Ireland, Bank of Tokyo and Fuji Bank. Some banks from Europe,
Asia, North America and South America are still balking at
some of the terms of the proposal, people involved in the
negotiations said.
   The banks with better security are less willing to go
along with the proposal, and generally the Japanese banks
have less security and are, therefore, more amenable.
   For many of the banks that purchased portions of loans
originally issued to Mr. Trump by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan, yesterday was the first day they could look at the
term sheet for the bailout and review it with their home
offices. Rough terms of the proposal were made available to
the banks 1 1/2 weeks ago.
   The larger creditors are essentially trying to convince
the smaller ones that it is better to have an orderly sale of
Mr. Trump's assets than allow a bankruptcy judge to decide
how they are disposed of. Also, some of the banks are said to
believe Mr. Trump will add value to his properties by
improving their performance in the coming year. People close
to the negotiations said about three-quarters of the 54
participants in Citicorp's loans had tentatively agreed to go
along with the deal.
   Mr. Trump's major creditors have offered the developer and
casino owner the $65 million loan and a suspension of
interest payments on $2 billion in bank debt. Mr. Trump would
cede equity in almost all of his properties to his creditors
and agree to sell many of them.
   Mr. Trump has until late Tuesday night to make a $43
million payment to Trump's Castle bondholders that he missed
Friday. After that, the property will go into default, which
could trigger defaults by other Trump properties.
   Still to be decided is whether the banks with the greatest
loan exposure to Mr. Trump, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, will
buy out some of Mr. Trump's recalcitrant smaller creditors.
   People close to the major banks said they were absolutely
unwilling to do so, but some of Mr. Trump's smaller creditors
said they doubted the big banks would allow the deal to fall
through if only one or two small creditors refused to approve
it.
   "The new strategy now is the smaller you are, the louder
you scream," said one person close to the negotiations.
