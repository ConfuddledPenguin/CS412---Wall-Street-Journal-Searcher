   Lawrenceville, N.J. -- For her April wedding, Karen Crowe,
nee Mayer, had a reception for 80 people at a lakefront
restaurant with music by a local disc jockey. When Jill
Bulanda, nee Gillespie, married later that month, there were
six bridesmaids in royal blue, bagpipes outside the church
and polka music at the reception for 161. And last Saturday,
Ronnell Hardrick, nee Talley, marched down the aisle trailing
four bridesmaids, one maid of honor, one matron of honor and
two flower girls -- all dressed in black-and-white -- as
nearly 200 guests looked on.
   They had never met, but these New Jersey brides had one
thing in common: their wedding dress. A frothy confection of
rose-patterned lace with a cathedral train, scalloped Queen
Anne neckline and a keyhole back filled in with 12 strands of
ersatz pearls, the dress, No. 1506, is one of 250 wedding
gowns rented out by a small shop in this comfortable exurban
town.

   Although traditionalists and romantics may scoff, the
"something borrowed" for today's cost-conscious bride may
well be her wedding dress.
   "They are wanting a look that's in all the bridal
magazines at $1,500 and realizing that's a couch or one
month's rent," said Shirley Tyndale, whose Fantasies
Unlimited has been renting out wedding gowns for the past
five years. "My motto here has become, you can rent a wedding
gown or buy a box."
   With many couples paying for all or part of their wedding,
the dress of a bride's dreams may be outside her budget.
Buying the gown is only the beginning: The prospective bride
must shell out even more money for alterations, a hoop skirt,
headpiece and veil. And when the wedding is over, it can cost
more than $200 to have the dress drycleaned and packed
between sheets of acid-free paper for storage that just could
last longer than the marriage.
   A modest stucco building on New Jersey's busy Route 1,
Fantasies Unlimited is packed to the gills with sequin- and
pearl-encrusted gowns. Nearly 1,750 frocks, including
ballgowns, prom dresses and mother-of-the-bride dresses, hang
from color-coded racks in the downstairs showroom. The
wedding dresses are crowded upstairs, where pearl headbands,
filmy wedding hats and tulle veils -- all for rent -- vie for
available wall space.
   "The mom and daughter sit here," Ms. Tyndale said, showing
off a tiny upstairs fitting room cozy with armchairs, gauzy
curtains and a cheval glass. "I'd ask her if she was
interested in renting or buying. People say, `People rent
wedding dresses?' And I say, `Well your groom is going to
rent a tux]' . . . When I show them a $1,000 dress that rents
for $500 to $600, which includes alterations and everything,
then they'd rather do that." Although use of a fluffy
crinoline is thrown in for free, the headpiece and veil can
cost an additional $50 to $120.
   A Jean Phoenix design with a $795 price tag, No. 1506
rents for $350 (the most expensive gowns go for $650). The
dress already has clocked five weddings since its purchase in
July, but until they saw it, none of its recent tenants had
planned on marrying in something borrowed.
   "You think to yourself, `Oh Jeez, do I want to rent?
You're supposed to keep your wedding dress,'" said Ms.
Bulanda, a vivacious 24-year-old who also rented her
bridesmaids' dresses through the store. "Then I said, this is
silly to spend so much money on something I'm never going to
wear again, not even for Halloween."
   These brides also were unconvinced by arguments that
today's pricey wedding dress is tomorrow's family heirloom.
   "If I'd have bought it, it just would have been sitting in
my closet till I had kids, and my daughter decided it was out
of style," Ms. Crowe said.
   Of course, no bride wants a gown that looks as if it's
been to the altar one time too many. Dresses are sent to the
cleaners after each wedding (during the busy summer season,
the shop's dry-cleaning bills total more than $2,000 a
month), and small tears are covered up with lacy appliques.
   "People have spilled things, ripped things -- underarm
stains -- we deal with a lot of that," Ms. Tyndale said. "I
have dresses that I have had {go out} five, six, seven times.
I have dresses that after the second time I don't use again."
   Dresses are altered to suit each bride. Plunging necklines
and open backs are filled in with sheer organza for Orthodox
Jewish weddings and more modest brides, while less retiring
types opt for extra sequins and beading. Sleeves are
routinely added and removed. Because each dress will be used
again, excess material is never cut, but gets hemmed in or
gathered up under peplums and bustles. For tall brides, a
false back can be put on a bow to gain several needed inches
of material, or lace added to the hem. The shop also stocks
extra pieces of fabric in case a few gussets around the hips
are needed.
   No. 1506, which entered life as a size 10, has been taken
up at the shoulders, let out at the seams and widened with
inserts of extra material. It has been rehemmed, rebustled
and partnered with a variety of veils and headpieces to suit
its different tenants. But those other brides did not matter
to Ms. Gillespie, as she then was. She had visited No. 1506
every week since she booked it in July.
   "I consider it mine. They all borrowed my dress," she
said, smiling at her reflection, as Ms. Tyndale repositioned
the tiny hoops that would gather up the long train into a
more manageable bustle. "Oh, I feel like I belong on a cake
top]"
   Less than two months later, the former Ms. Talley was
laying her claim to 1506, as her mother and her two-month-old
baby daughter looked on.
   "It's real wide, like a Shirley Temple {dress}, like
Cinderella dresses," said Ms. Talley, fluffing the lace
skirts. To make it wider still, she opted for a six-hoop
crinoline underneath, the puffiest one available.
   By this time, the dress was in need of some minor repairs
and alterations. The organza ruffle at the hem was frayed in
places ("John stepped on the bustle a few times, and I'm sure
it didn't have anything to do with the vodka and 7-Ups he was
drinking," Ms. Bulanda recalled). And Ms. Talley herself had
changed shape since she first tried the dress on last June
and found it on the roomy side. After the birth of her baby,
Olivia, she couldn't help noticing that 1506 was more than a
little tight around the hips.
   "See what you did to me?" Ms. Talley scolded Olivia, who
sat quietly on the lap of her grandmother Jill Fitchett.
   "A two-inch piece on each side," Ms. Tyndale later
instructed one of her staffers. "We'll have to match the
material."
   The summer is far from over for 1506. After Ms. Hardrick's
wedding, it has just a few weeks' rest on the rack before it
hits the aisle for the sixth time next month. When its lace
and organza finally look too tired for yet another round of
the wedding march from "Lohengrin," the dress will either be
sold for a bargain price or donated to a church sale or local
theatrical group.
   Of course, some brides do end up keeping the dress they
only intended to borrow. No. 1506 was ordered to replace an
identical dress that was bought by one such bride -- who
first had to return it for a previously booked wedding. But
the brides who've worn 1506 suffered no sentimental pangs
when it came time to return the dress to the shop.
   "Actually, I couldn't wait to get the stupid thing off at
the end of the night," Ms. Bulanda said.
   By the time she stopped by to visit Ms. Tyndale after her
honeymoon, 1506 was already a thing of the past."I didn't
even ask to see it," she said.
