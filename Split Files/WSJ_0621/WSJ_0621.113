   WASHINGTON -- Legislation authorizing U.S. participation
in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which is expected to start approving loans to Eastern
European countries next year, cleared its first hurdle in
Congress.
   A House Banking subcommittee approved a bill that would
allow the White House and the Treasury to provide $1.2
billion of the $12 billion envisioned as the bank's initial
capital. Congress would be expected to appropriate about $360
million of this amount over a five-year period. The remainder
of the U.S. pledge would be in the form of a callable capital
commitment.

   Separately, the White House asked the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees to approve the first $70 million
installment of the proposed U.S. "paid-in" capital.
   In other action, the House panel agreed to authorize about
$3.18 billion to help finance loans by the International
Development Association to poorer Third World nations. The
U.S. and other countries have agreed to channel about $15
billion to the World Bank affiliate over three years. The
U.S. share still would have to be approved by the House and
Senate Appropriations committees.
   The subcommittee also voted to allocate about $500 million
in funds for the U.S. Export-Import Bank for "tied-aid" loans
to help U.S. companies compete for business in Eastern
Europe. Such loans could be approved when other western
nations offer export credits on highly-concessional terms in
an effort to win contracts for companies in their countries.
