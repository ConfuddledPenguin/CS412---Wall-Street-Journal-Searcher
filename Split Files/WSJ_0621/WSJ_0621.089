   A unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group violated Delaware
disclosure laws in its 1985 acquisition of the minority
shares of Shell Oil Co., a Delaware judge ruled.
   Chancery Court Judge Maurice A. Hartnett III said minority
holders should have been told about the existence of
approximately $1 billion in Shell Oil gas and oil reserves.

   The inadequate disclosure was due to an error in
calculation, the judge acknowledged, but he said it still
breached disclosure requirements. He said the information was
important enough that it might have caused some holders to
seek an appraisal of their shares' value, instead of
tendering the stock to the Royal Dutch unit, Shell Petroleum
Inc.
   Judge Hartnett didn't rule on a remedy for the 20,000
former Shell Oil holders who brought the class action suit
seeking more money for their shares. That will be determined
after a separate hearing, the judge said.
   Lee Godfrey, an attorney with the Houston firm of Susman
Godfrey, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said he was
"confident" the judge would find the fair value was
"substantially in excess" of the $60 a share the minority
holders received from the Royal Dutch unit.
   In a separate action in Delaware, Susman Godfrey is
representing another group of Shell Oil holders who did seek
appraisal of their shares instead of tendering their stock.
In that case, an expert for the plaintiffs has argued that
the shares are worth between $89 and $109 each. An appraiser
for the Royal Dutch unit has placed the value at $55 a share.
   Royal Dutch, based in the Netherlands and London, in 1984
began trying to acquire the 30.6% stake of Shell Oil it
didn't already own. Its $58-a-share tender offer was
challenged in Delaware court. A subsequent settlement of the
suit in effect increased the price to $60 a share and Royal
Dutch went on to acquire all but 5.4% of Shell Oil's shares.
   Under Delaware law, a company that owns more than 90% of
another company's stock can take the remaining minority
shares at a set price. Minority holders can either accept the
price or seek an appraisal of their stock in an attempt to
get more money. The case decided by Judge Hartnett involved
minority holders who accepted Royal Dutch's $60 price and
then sued, claiming the disclosure materials they received
violated state law.
   In Houston, Shell Oil said it is "disappointed" with the
ruling. The company said Judge Hartnett based his decision on
an inadvertent error that left out about 8% of the discounted
future net cash flow from estimated oil and gas reserves.
Shell termed that information "soft" data based on "numerous
assumptions and estimates."
   In light of the "voluminous" information that was
furnished to shareholders, "we believe they could readily
have made an informed decision with respect to the 1985
merger proposal," Shell said.

   PAN AM IS SUED for breach of settlement by families of
Lockerbie crew.
   The survivors of the flight crew, killed when Pan Am
Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December
1988, claim that Pan Am World Airways violated an agreement
to pay them compensation benefits totaling $2.6 million.
Those benefits are owed under the crew's employment
contracts, according to the suit. The benefits aren't related
to damages that may be sought in other suits against the
airline and other Pan Am Corp. subsidiaries, said Read K.
McCaffrey, an attorney for the flight-crew's families.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York,
claims that the families agreed to a settlement proposal from
Pan Am on June 6, but that the airline added a requirement
that substantially changed the agreement a week later. Mr.
McCaffrey said the added language would have required the
families to agree not to sue the airline for any wrongdoing
related to the explosion. Other suits stemming from the
Lockerbie bombing have claimed that Pan Am's security
measures were inadequate.
   A spokesman for Pan Am declined to comment. Also named as
a defendant in the suit is Pan Am's insurer, U.S. Aviation
Underwriters Inc. Dominick A. Alfieri, a vice president of
U.S. Aviation, said he couldn't comment on pending
litigation.
   Mr. McCaffrey said the families want to preserve their
right to sue the airline in case pending investigations of
the bombing indicate that Pan Am was negligent in its
security efforts. He said the language added to the agreement
was "an outrageous and unreasonable demand."
   The compensation benefits ranged from $8,000 for one
flight attendant who had no dependent survivors to $500,000
each for the pilot and the flight engineer. The benefits are
based on wages and other factors in the contract, Mr.
McCaffrey said.
   The compensation benefits "have nothing to do with who or
what caused the plane to go down," Mr. McCaffrey said. "We
still would have been entitled to these amounts."

   ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE argument rejected by appeals
court.
   A former defense lawyer in Philadelphia who offered legal
assistance to an alleged member of the revolutionary May 19
Movement can be ordered to testify before a federal grand
jury, a federal appeals court has ruled.
   Linda Backiel, in private practice in Puerto Rico, has so
far refused to testify, asserting among other arguments an
attorney-client privilege. The principle is meant to protect
all confidences between clients and lawyers from disclosure.
   Cases such as this one are beginning to alarm defense
lawyers. Compelling lawyers to testify about what their
clients tell them could make clients reluctant to disclose
important information to their lawyer, defense attorneys
argue.
   In this case, Elizabeth Ann Duke was awaiting trial in
Philadelphia on weapons and explosives charges when she
disappeared in 1985. At the time, Ms. Backiel was doing legal
research for her defense team. Ms. Backiel never represented
Ms. Duke in court but was allegedly the last person to see a
note from her describing her motives in the case and her
intention to flee. The note has since disappeared.
   Subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating the disappearance, Ms. Backiel asserted the
attorney-client privilege and refused to discuss the note or
anything else related to the case. Following a hearing last
March before U.S. District Judge Charles R. Weiner, in
Philadelphia, she was held in contempt.
   Last week, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered
a new hearing, but only because Judge Weiner closed parts of
the initial hearing to the public.
   The appeals judges rejected arguments that compelling
disclosure would have a chilling effect on Ms. Backiel's
attorney-client relationship with other controversial
clients, and that federal prosecutors had singled her out for
representing radicals.
   Another hearing, this one in open court, is expected
within 10 days, said a defense attorney for Ms. Backiel, who
declined further comment.
   If she continues to refuse to testify, Ms. Backiel faces
as much as 18 months in jail.

   LEGAL RESIDENCY standards expanded by judge.
   A federal district judge in Rockford, Ill., ordered the
Agriculture Department to include sod as a perishable
commodity under agency regulations that grant certain alien
farm workers easier access to legal resident status.
   The ruling could make it easier for up to 10,000 illegal
foreign agricultural workers to establish permanent U.S.
residency, according to the lawyers for farm workers and
sod-farm owners.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley J. Roszkowski said the
agency's exclusion of sod in their Special Agricultural
Workers regulations, or SAW, was "arbitrary and capricious."
   The regulations, enacted in the wake of the Immigration
Reform Control Act of 1986, offer legal resident status to
certain illegal aliens, including those who can prove they
had been performing "seasonal agricultural services" in the
U.S. for 90 days in the one-year period ending May, 1986.
   SAW includes as seasonal agricultural services the growing
of fruits, vegetables, and "other perishable commodities,"
including Christmas trees. A group of sod-farm owners and
workers filed a suit against officials at the U.S.
departments of Agriculture, Justice, and Immigration, arguing
that their crops have critical and unpredictable labor
demands, and therefore meet the standards for inclusion under
SAW.
   A spokesman for the Justice department said the agency is
reviewing the decision and "considering our options."
