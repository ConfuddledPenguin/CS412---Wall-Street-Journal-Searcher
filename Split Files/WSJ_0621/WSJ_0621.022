MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)

   Investors continued to pour cash into money-market mutual
funds in the latest week, as yields hardly budged.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report rose by $2.3 billion, to $379.5 billion.
Nearly half the inflow, however, is attributable to four
funds newly listed by the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.

   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, inched up to 7.96% from 7.95% in
the week ended Tuesday. The average had slipped an equal
amount the previous week and has been at or just below 8%
since late January.
   Martha Whittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's, said some of the
money flowing into the funds may have come from the stock
market, which saw a 53.71-point drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average Monday.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments, such things as
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), Treasury bills
and certificates of deposit, lengthened by a day to 44 days.
Average maturity has been 43 or 44 days for 10 weeks,
indicating that a dramatic change in yields isn't expected
any time soon.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
edged up to 7.67% from 7.65%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.67% from 7.68% and the average 30-day compound
yield eased to 7.96% from 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free money funds rose by a tiny fraction of
a percentage point, while assets fell. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 222 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's was 5.40%, up from 5.37%. That's equivalent to a
taxable 7.50% for investors in the 28% tax bracket and 8.06%
for those paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-free funds declined by $863 million, to
$76.1 billion. Average maturity lengthened by two days to 40
days.
