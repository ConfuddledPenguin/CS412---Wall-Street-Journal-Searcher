   TORONTO -- Goldcorp Investments Ltd. said it reached an
agreement with two former directors of subsidiary companies
that heads off a proxy battle over board representation.
   Robert McEwen, Goldcorp's president and chief executive
officer, said the company agreed to review its relationship
with CSA Management Ltd. and subsidiaries Dickenson Gold
Mines Ltd. and Wharf Resources Ltd. "with a view to
restructuring" Goldcorp.

   CSA Management, a company controlled by Mr. McEwen's
family, controls practically all the votes in Goldcorp
through its holding of common shares. Goldcorp's Class A
shareholders, with limited voting powers, are entitled to
elect two of the eight Goldcorp directors.
   James McCartney, a Toronto lawyer, and Robert Simon,
senior vice president and treasurer of Brascan Ltd., have
launched a proxy battle against Goldcorp management to gain
seats on the board. Among other things, the two questioned
the investment management fees paid by Goldcorp to CSA.
Goldcorp's annual meeting is scheduled for Monday.
   Mr. McEwen said Goldcorp also will consider enlarging its
board to 10 members, to include an additional two directors
to be elected by holders of the Class A, subordinate-voting
shares. He said Messrs. McCartney and Simon would be
nominated to these additional board seats.
   Mr. McEwen said he expects a restructuring plan to be
presented for shareholder approval later this year.
