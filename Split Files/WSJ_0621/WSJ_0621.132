   I'm somewhat in awe
   Of the corporate raider
   Who can be either overt
   Or an enfilader.
   I wonder if the taker-over
   Feels elated or shaken
   Or even imagines himself
   As the overtaken.
   I'm edgy enough
   When I am followed,
   But that's nothing compared
   With being swallowed.

   Too Tough
                                                                                                       

   One thing about modern education -- it has greatly reduced
the temptation to do our kids' homework for them.
   -- Ivern Ball.
