   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. -- Esselte Business Systems Inc. said
shareholders approved its merger agreement with parent
Esselte AB of Sweden, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.
   Esselte AB already owned 78% of the shares outstanding of
the U.S. holding company for the Swedish concern's office,
graphic arts and retail supplies business, and agreed last
November to acquire the remaining 4.9 million shares for at
least $227.9 million. The company said that following the
merger vote yesterday, each remaining share will be converted
to $48.06.
