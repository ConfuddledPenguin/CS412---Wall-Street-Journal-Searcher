   I was dismayed by an article in your May 11 Medicine &amp;
Health special report, with the headline "Exercise in
Futility," showing a person inside a wheel of fortune
apparently getting a stress test. A test that is two-thirds
accurate is far from perfect, but it is hardly an exercise in
futility.
   In addition, you overlooked newer developments in testing
for coronary artery disease. Let me give you examples of
noninvasive, safe, painless tests that are as accurate as
catheterization (about 91%) and cost less than half the
amount charged for a catheterization. One is called a
thallium-201 imaging, which actually measures blood flow
through the muscle of the heart. Another test is a
combination of echocardiogram or electrocardiogram with
Dipyridamole, which is especially suitable for people with
impaired mobility or low cardiac reserve.
