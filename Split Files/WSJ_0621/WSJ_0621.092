   TOKYO -- Japan's "Big Four" securities houses managed to
post increases in group pretax profits for the fiscal year
ended March 31, despite the sharp plunge in Japanese stock
and bond prices from January through March.
   Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko
Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. said strong
results during the first nine months of the fiscal year
helped them emerge from the final quarter's plunge ahead of
the previous fiscal year's results.

   However, the continued fallout from the confusion in
Japanese markets during the January-March quarter has led the
four to issue pessimistic predictions for the current fiscal
year.
   The four companies changed their fiscal year from one
beginning Oct. 1 to one beginning April 1, starting with
fiscal 1989.
   As a result, fiscal 1988 covers only a six-month period.
The companies doubled fiscal 1988 figures in order to make
comparisons with fiscal 1989's full-year figures.
   Underwriting and distribution commissions for the four
companies rose strongly, reflecting the surge in equity
finance for the year, overcoming relatively weaker earnings
from brokerage commissions on stock and bond transactions and
net gains on trading.
   Because of the explosion in equity finance during fiscal
1989, and the current suspension of equity finance during the
first months of fiscal 1990 on account of the stock market's
fragile condition, the Big Four predicted income from
underwriting would fall drastically this year.
   In addition, a drop in commissions on transactions from
June will cut into another source of the Big Four's income.
   Nomura reported fiscal-year pretax profits edged up 0.1%
to 538.01 billion yen ($3.5 billion). Earnings rose 9% to
261.64 billion yen.
   Daiwa said group pretax profit edged up 0.9% to 339.2
billion yen during fiscal 1989. Profit rose 11% to 164
billion yen.
   Nikko said group pretax earnings for fiscal 1989 edged up
0.1% to 274.67 billion yen. Profit climbed 10% to 130.04
billion yen.
   Yamaichi reported pretax profit rose 8.3% to 247.61
billion yen during fiscal 1989. Earnings rose 8.9% to 108.8
billion yen.
