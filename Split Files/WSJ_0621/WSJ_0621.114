   Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., a Sydney, Australia, company that
makes 99% of the Coca-Cola consumed in Australia and is
59.5%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. of the U.S., is negotiating to
buy a stake in an Indonesian Coke franchise.

   He said the company's chairman and managing director Dean
Wills has been to Jakarta for discussion about buying into a
Coca-Cola franchise there, but said it would be "months"
until negotiations are finalized.
   Coca-Cola Amatil currently has no beverage interests in
Southeast Asia. It owns 99% of the Coca-Cola franchises in
Australia, all of the New Zealand franchises and around 70%
of the Austrian franchises.
