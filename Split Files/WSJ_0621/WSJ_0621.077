   NEW YORK -- National Patent Development Corp. said it
began an exchange offer for a bond issue to try to reduce its
long-term debt and interest expense, and to give it more
"financial flexibility."
   The holding company said the offer is for its 7% dual
currency convertible bonds due March 18, 1996. For each
$3,000 principal amount of bonds tendered, National Patent
will exchange an as-yet-to-be-determined number of its common
shares with a par value of one cent a share and a market
value of $1,800 and warrants to purchase 300 shares of newly
issued common with a par value of one cent a share in
Interferon Sciences Inc., National Patent's 82%-controlled
subsidiary. The National Patent shares will be priced five
days before the offer closes Aug. 10; the Interferon warrants
are exercisable until Aug. 16, 1992.

   As of March 31, there were $10.9 million of the bonds
outstanding. If all of the bonds are tendered, National
Patent will realize an extraordinary gain of about $1.9
million. National Patent's long-term debt was about $85
million at the end of March. The company had 1989 sales of
about $278 million.
   National Patent said it agreed to reduce the $9 million
debt Interferon owes it, by $240 for each $3,000 in bonds
tendered. Interferon Sciences is a biotechnology concern that
focuses on developing and manufacturing interferon-based
products to treat viral diseases, cancer and immune system
deficiencies.
   National Patent shares closed yesterday ex-dividend at
$5.75, down 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite
trading. Interferon Sciences shares traded at $8.125 bid in
over-the-counter trading.
