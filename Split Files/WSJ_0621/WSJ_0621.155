   NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted a
gasoline-distribution unit of Getty Petroleum Corp. and one
of the unit's executives for tax evasion and conspiracy.
   Getty Petroleum, a Jericho, N.Y., independent gasoline
marketer, said Tuesday that the office of U.S. Attorney
Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn had notified the company that it
was seeking the indictment.

   The four-count indictment names as defendants Getty
Terminals Corp. and William Rea, manager of the unit's Supply
and Trading department, primarily responsible for gasoline
sales.
   Also charged were John Pabone, president and owner of J&amp;J
Petroleum Inc., a Staten Island, N.Y., gasoline distributor;
and John Quock, president and owner of Tun Yung Oil Corp. and
Westwind Petroleum Inc., both New York gasoline distributors.
   A separate indictment issued yesterday charges two
brothers, Richard and Robert Kennon, with filing false
excise-tax returns and conspiracy. The Kennons are owners
and, respectively, president and vice president of three
gasoline companies: Jenny Oil Corp., Pelham, N.Y., and Oil
City Enterprises Inc. and Mount Vernon Energy Terminals Inc.,
both in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
   The indictments are part of what the Justice Department
called a continuing "multi-agency investigation into an
estimated $1 billion annual nationwide loss" of federal
gasoline and diesel excise taxes because of fraud in gasoline
wholesaling.
   Getty Terminals said it is "outraged" about the
indictment, which charges it with evading $946,000 of taxes
in 1985. The charges are "completely baseless," the company
said, and it plans a vigorous defense for itself and Mr. Rea,
who couldn't be reached for comment.
   Messrs. Quock, Pabone and Kennon couldn't be reached.
