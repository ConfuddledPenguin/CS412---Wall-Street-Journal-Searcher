   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
voted to approve Chicago Board of Trade proposals to trade
options on the exchange's Tokyo stock price index-futures
contract and its long-term Japanese government bond-futures
contract.
   The option on the Tokyo stock price index, known as Topix,
will give the holder the right to buy or sell Topix futures
contracts at a specified strike price by a certain expiration
date. Option premiums will be quoted in Japanese yen.

   The CFTC also directed its staff to draft an
interpretation clarifying regulatory treatment of the Brent
oil 15-day contract. The interpretation is expected to
clarify that the Brent oil contract is a forward contract and
thus exempt from CFTC jurisdiction.
   A forward contract is generally an agreement that is
privately negotiated between two commercial parties and isn't
required to be traded on a registered futures exchange.
