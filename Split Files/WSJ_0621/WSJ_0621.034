   Friday night in Westhampton, Long Island. The crowd files
into the movie theater, buzzing in anticipation over "Dick
Tracy." The lights dim. All eyes turn to the screen. And then
-- commercials for Diet Coke and American Express.
   What's wrong with this picture?

<TEXT>
   "Dick Tracy" is a Walt Disney release. That's the same
Disney that trumpeted its new policy, as of March, to ban
theaters from running ads before its pictures. Yet here at
the Hampton Arts theater in New York, and at dozens of other
theaters owned by Cineplex Odeon across North America,
commercials run before every showing of the Disney flick. Ads
air before Disney's "Pretty Woman," too. In all, Cineplex
Odeon is showing Disney films on 170 of its more than 1,550
screens, and isn't banning ads on any of them.
   Disney and its competitor Warner Bros., which has a
similar ad-ban policy for its films, are finding that grand
proclamations are one thing, but enforcing an ad ban in movie
theaters is something else altogether. The problem is that
theater chains such as Cineplex Odeon have long-running
contracts with advertisers, contracts that will last for
months or even years to come. "We can't force people to break
contracts," says a Disney spokeswoman, and "we've got to play
some Cineplex houses because there's so many of them."
   The upshot: the Disney and Warner ad bans may not look
like bans at all to the average man on the street.
   Cineplex isn't the only chain showing ads before Disney
and Warner pictures. Cobb Theaters, a Southern chain based in
Birmingham, Ala., with 300 screens, is doing it as well.
Cobb, too, had pre-existing agreements with advertisers. But
Cineplex, with over 1,550 screens, is the largest player
running the ads. Aside from the commercials it runs before
various Disney releases, it also allows ads before the Time
Warner films it is showing on some 230 screens, including
"Gremlins II" and "Driving Miss Daisy."
   The ads promise to be around for a long while. A
spokeswoman for Cineplex, based in Toronto, declines to say
how long the theater chain's contracts with advertisers run,
but says: "There certainly is some time to go on certain
contracts. We aren't talking about something that would
disappear almost immediately." Advertisers say such contracts
typically run several years. Cobb executives declined to
comment.
   The Disney spokeswoman says a number of other theater
owners were able to renegotiate agreements with advertisers
and to pull ads from Disney releases. For those that are
still running ads because of pre-existing contracts, the
spokeswoman says Disney hopes that the contracts won't be
renewed. "We would hope the theaters think twice about
showing advertisements at all," she says. Warner executives
couldn't be reached.
   Advertisers, though, say they have no plans to leave show
business, not as long as they can still see their ads on the
silver screen. Their contracts with such chains as Cineplex
have put them in a position where they barely have to think
about the Disney and Warner ad bans. "Right now," says a
Coca-Cola spokesman, "we have to view it for us as business
as usual."
   Although he won't speculate on what will happen after
Coke's contract with Cineplex expires, the spokesman says:
"As long as theater owners provide us an opportunity to
advertise in their chains, we will continue to evaluate that
and take advantage of it. We view theater advertising as an
effective form of advertising."
   The Cineplex spokeswoman declined to comment on how the
chain will entice such current advertisers as American
Express, Coke and the Los Angeles Times to stay on after
their contracts expire, if Disney and Warner films are no
longer part of the ad package. The movie chain is faced with
a touchy situation.
   "We have good relationships with all the studios,
including those who have said they're opposed to screen
advertising, and we intend to continue those good relations,
so we will accommodate things they feel firmly about," the
spokeswoman says. But, she adds, "Obviously, we have a
difference of opinion. Cineplex believes {screen advertising}
is appropriate and can be entertaining."

   RJR's `Mr. Fit' Ads
                                                                                                       

   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco agreed not to run ads that,
according to the Federal Trade Commission, misrepresented the
findings of a government study on smoking.
   In 1986, R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco, ran a
series of print ads, one of which discussed a study funded by
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The ad claimed
that the institute's so-called "Mr. Fit" study provided
scientific evidence that smoking isn't as hazardous as the
public had been led to believe.
   In a complaint filed in June 1986, the FTC claimed that
the ads misrepresented the study's findings. The FTC said
that R.J. Reynolds, among other things, failed to disclose
that the men in the study who quit smoking had a
significantly lower rate of heart disease than men who
continued to smoke.
   Under the settlement, R.J. Reynolds agreed not to
misrepresent in future ads the purpose or results of the
study. A spokeswoman for the company said that R.J. Reynolds
still believes that the ad didn't distort the report's
findings. But she added that the company agreed to the
settlement because of the length and the cost of the
litigation.
   "We decided to accept the settlement and put the matter
behind us," she said.

   SAATCHI AGREEMENT: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. said it reached
an agreement with the Independent Television Association that
will allow it to continue booking air time on BBC, the
British broadcaster. ITV, a middleman between Saatchi and the
BBC, last week asked for financial guarantees because of
Saatchi's financial troubles.
