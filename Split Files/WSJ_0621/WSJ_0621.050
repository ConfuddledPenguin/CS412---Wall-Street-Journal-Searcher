   NEW YORK -- The woman whose life was the basis for the
book and movie "The Three Faces of Eve," reached a settlement
with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. over the movie rights
to her life story.
   Under terms of the agreement, Fox acknowleged Christine
Costner Sizemore's right to grant motion picture rights to
her current book, "A Mind of My Own," her previous books and
any future books she may write.

   Mrs. Sizemore acknowledged that Fox holds and retains all
rights to "The Three Faces of Eve." The 1957 movie was a
major hit and won an Oscar for actress Joanne Woodward, who
played "Eve" in the story.
   Mrs. Sizemore, who had been treated for
multiple-personality disorder, signed the rights away to Fox
for $7,000 in 1956. She previously said she wasn't
represented by a lawyer and "the personalities would've
signed anything" her psychiatrist recommended. Mrs. Sizemore
said she was cured in 1974 and has since become an advocate
for the rights of the mentally ill.
   Mrs. Sizemore, who lives in Florida, had sued in federal
court in Manhattan last year, challenging Fox's claim that it
held all the motion picture rights to her life story.
   Mrs. Sizemore said in a statement she was pleased that the
differences were resolved with Fox. Officials of Fox, which
is owned by News Corp., couldn't be reached for comment.
