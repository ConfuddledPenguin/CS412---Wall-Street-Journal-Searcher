   NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices rose in the morning but
fell in the afternoon on yet another shred of news that
suggests the Federal Reserve isn't about to ease its grip on
interest rates.
   While stocks managed to eke out a small gain because of a
spurt of program buying that erased a 10-point deficit within
minutes of the final bell, bonds finished lower. The same
news that undercut those markets was a factor in pushing the
dollar slightly higher against other major currencies.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.74 points
higher at 2895.30 in a third consecutive day of lethargic
trading. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly a
half point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount, also in
quiet trading.
   Bonds headed lower after the noon release of the "Beige
Book" -- a bimonthly compilation of regional Federal Reserve
Bank economic reports that members of the Federal Open Market
Committee will study before their next meeting, July 2 and 3.
   The book contained no major surprises, but it is viewed as
an indicator of the Fed governors' thinking. Investors
focused on two elements in it that might reinforce the Fed's
current reluctance to ease interest rates.
   First, the report noted strong growth in capital-goods
industries. Second, the opening summary suggests the rate of
inflation isn't declining, though the regional reports that
follow didn't offer much evidence to back up that conclusion,
said Raymond W. Stone, managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates, Princeton, N.J.
   Also hurting bond prices was a large supply of new
corporate and municipal bond issues. Dealers taking these
issues into their inventories as they begin searching for
buyers tend to sell government bonds to offset the carrying
cost.
   Stock investors followed bond prices until the late spate
of buying. "Institutional participation remains light," said
Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities
International.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices edged higher on volume of 137.4 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 777 to 668.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6785 marks and 153.93 yen, compared with
1.6738 marks and 153.55 yen Tuesday.
