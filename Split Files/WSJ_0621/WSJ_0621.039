   WASHINGTON -- A titanic struggle is under way in Congress
over legislation that would overhaul product-liability law.
Just the kind of fight lobbyists and lawmakers love, it pits
two giant special interests, Big Business and trial lawyers,
against each other.
   But despite million-dollar lobbying campaigns by both
sides, Congress is unlikely to act on the measure this year.

   And that's good news for members of Congress and lobbyists
who, for almost a decade, have been feeding off the
contributions from political action committees and the fat
retainers that product-liability legislation has generated.
It means PAC contributions and lobbying fees will continue
next year.
   The bill is part of a breed of legislation known as a
"cash cow." Rarely do these cash-generating pieces of
legislation ever pass. But like perennial flowers, they
sprout again every Congress, replenishing the coffers of
lawmakers and lobbyists. Other cash cows have resulted from
efforts to narrow the insurance industry's exemption from
federal antitrust law and to curb the civil use of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
   A business lobbying coalition, made up of chemical, auto
and pharmaceutical manufacturers and insurance companies that
want federal legislation to limit the rights of plaintiffs in
lawsuits over allegedly defective products, has contributed
more than $2 million since 1983 to members of the Senate
Commerce Committee. A product-liability bill has been
introduced in each new Congress in that period, and last
month the panel approved another such bill by a 13-7 vote.
   For Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.), a co-sponsor of the
current product-liability bill, this lobbying effort has
meant more than $200,000 in PAC contributions for his Senate
races in 1986 and 1988. For Sen. John Rockefeller (D.,
W.Va.), a more recent convert, it has meant $60,000 in PAC
contributions for his 1990 re-election drive.
   Trial lawyers, whose contingency fees in product-liability
cases are endangered by the bill, have contributed, too.
Their PAC money has been a much more modest $81,000, but
hundreds of thousands of dollars more in contributions flow
directly from individual lawyers.
   Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), who voted against the bill
last month, has received $20,000 from the PAC of the powerful
Association of Trial Lawyers of America in recent years. Sen.
Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.), chairman of the panel and a foe
of product-liability overhaul, received $5,000 from the
trial-lawyers association's PAC and thousands more from
individual trial lawyers.
   "The bill is a PAC annuity for members of Congress," says
Ralph Nader, one of several consumer activists allied with
the trial lawyers. "It's like rubbing the golden lamp." A PAC
analysis by Public Citizen, one of Mr. Nader's
consumer-advocacy groups, shows that six members of the
Senate Commerce Committee, all of whom voted for the
product-liability bill, received more than 12% of their PAC
money in their most recent re-election campaigns from
companies or trade associations lobbying for the measure.
   But Mr. Nader's own sources of funding have become an
issue in the product-liability fight. Some proponents of the
bill allege that he and other consumer activists lobbying
against the bill depend on trial lawyers for financial
support.
   "I'm not saying he's in their pocket, but Ralph Nader is
the trial lawyer's hero," says Victor Schwartz, a Washington
lawyer who represents one of the business groups lobbying on
product-liability legislation. His side has spent more than
$1 million each year on a massive lobbying drive.
   Mr. Nader concedes that some of his groups receive
contributions from individual trial lawyers. "But if they
didn't exist, this fight would go on," he says. Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, says contributions
from trial lawyers amount to a "minuscule" portion of Public
Citizen's $4 million annual budget. Public Citizen doesn't
accept corporate contributions, including any funds from the
trial-lawyers association, she adds.
   Some members of the Senate Commerce Committee have taken
PAC money from both the coalition promoting the
product-liability legislation and the trial lawyers opposing
it. "The bill has been a boon to many legislators running for
Congress because they get money from both sides," says Alan
Parker, deputy executive director of public affairs for the
trial-lawyers association.
   Besides its contributions, the association also has a team
of experienced lobbyists, led by Thomas Boggs Jr. of the
politically well-connected Washington law firm of Patton,
Boggs &amp; Blow.
   The politically touchy issue of money spilled into the
open at a Commerce Committee hearing on the bill in May. A
number of senators, including Mr. Rockefeller, expressed
outrage over a letter Mr. Nader sent to their home-state
newspapers. In the letter, Mr. Nader suggested that members
of the panel were "huddled" with Washington lobbyists, also
major contributors to their campaigns, who favor the
product-liability bill. At the hearing, an angry Sen.
Rockefeller asked the committee staff to investigate the
funding of several consumer groups to see how much money they
receive from trial lawyers.
   Although the West Virginia Democrat quickly called off the
investigation, he remains angry over Mr. Nader's lobbying
tactics. "The one thing the people of West Virginia know is
that I don't owe my soul to anybody," says Mr. Rockefeller,
who is the great-grandson, namesake and heir of the late
founder of Standard Oil, and who spent millions of his
personal fortune to win his first Senate election in 1984. "I
don't say that snottily," he adds, "that's just one of the
advantages of having independent means."
   The Nader forces, meanwhile, intend to make the large PAC
contributions from companies and trade associations
supporting the bill a big issue as the fight moves toward the
Senate floor. "The issue would not exist in Congress were it
not for the PAC contributions," says Pamela Gilbert,
legislative director for Congress Watch, another arm of the
Nader organization.
   St. Clair Tweedie, director of government affairs for
American Cyanamid Co., says such arguments are overblown and
that the PAC money contributed to Commerce Committee members
by companies and groups in the product-liability coalition
isn't necessarily tied to the bill. "We have many issues," he
says. "They {plaintiffs' lawyers} have only one: Don't screw
with my yacht."
   Although the Commerce Committee approved the bill, the
measure is now in the hands of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which is less likely to give its approval, and the
Senate floor outlook is even more uncertain. There hasn't
been any House action this year on a product-liability bill,
and there probably won't be.
   And this keeps the lawmakers in the catbird's seat. The
bitter lobbying stalemate means that product-liability
legislation will remain in legislative limbo -- a cash cow
with plenty of milk left. "This bill has the perfect tension
to keep it alive," says Mr. Schwartz.

   SEN. JOHN KERRY (D., Mass.) hasn't accepted contributions
from political action committees in any of his campaigns for
federal office. Because of an error in Federal Election
Commission data, he was listed in Thursday's edition as
having received $2,000 in PAC contributions from companies
supporting the overhaul of federal product-liability laws.
