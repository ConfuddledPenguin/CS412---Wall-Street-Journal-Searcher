   Revco D.S. Inc., Twinsburg, Ohio, said it agreed to sell
46 stores, most of them in Alabama, as part of a plan to
divest itself of 712 stores in 17 states. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The sales agreements require approval by the bankruptcy
court in Akron, Ohio. Revco, which is operating under
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, said it now has
agreements to sell 485 stores. The company said the
divestitures are being made so that it can concentrate on its
1,100 drugstores in 10 eastern states.
