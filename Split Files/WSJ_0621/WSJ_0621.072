   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. rolled out a
long-distance service designed to give small- and
medium-sized business customers features that generally had
been available only to big companies.
   The new service, called MCI Vision, is based on a flat
per-minute charge and is targeted at companies that spend
between $500 and $50,000 a month on long-distance service.

   Timothy Price, MCI's vice president for general business,
said the package includes flat-rate pricing, volume
discounts, virtual private-line services, and a comprehensive
bill that lists credit-card calls as well as domestic and
international long-distance charges for all of a company's
branch offices. Calls can be tracked by employee, departments
or calling cards.
   The $18 billion smaller-business segment of the
long-distance industry is getting more attention as
competition has squeezed margins in the residential and
big-business segments. "MCI is focusing its sales force on
the middle market because that's where the richest margins
are," said Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. "Frankly, the
margins are drying up in the high end."
   Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the MCI
move shows that competition is shifting away from price
cutting. "This isn't some deep discount," he said. "It's an
attempt to bring down functionality to a lower market
segment." MCI, he said, is "clearly reacting to AT&amp;T's
success in defending its share of the middle market."
   While American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s share of the
middle market is about 50%, MCI figures it has 14% to 15%. To
increase its share, MCI has beefed up its sales force by
about 500 since the beginning of the year, Mr. Price said.
   At AT&amp;T, Joseph Nacchio, vice president-marketing for
business communications services, said AT&amp;T could replicate
the MCI package in a couple of days, but wants to watch MCI's
performance first. "We were waiting for some killer product,"
he said. "But I didn't find anyone here lying down because
bullets were flying."
   Investors apparently expected a more significant
announcement as well. MCI's shares fell 87.5 cents to $41.625
in national over-the-counter trading. AT&amp;T's shares rose 37.5
cents to $43.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   To promote the new service, MCI launched a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign developed by Wells,
Rich, Greene Inc. The campaign, which uses the tag line
"Big-business long distance for your business," includes 15-
and 30-second television spots. The spots are being aired
during network morning and evening news shows and sports
programs, as well as CNN business shows and ESPN baseball
games. The company also has a print campaign that will be run
in newspapers and local business journals.
   Among the MCI Vision features is a "hotline" service that
allows a caller to connect automatically to a telephone in
another city. Another is a "remote" service that allows a
company to maintain a local number that actually rings at a
distant location. If a company does a lot of business in one
city, but doesn't want to maintain an office there, it can
set up a number that would be answered at the company's main
office.
   Basic rates for domestic service are 20 cents a minute
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. for direct dialed calls into the
MCI network and 15 cents for calls placed through a direct
connection between the customer and the MCI network. Off-peak
calls are 20% less. Rates for international calls are based
on the destination, time of day and type of access to the MCI
network. MCI also is offering customers the option of
delivering bills on paper or magnetic tape.
   "This is a one-size fits-all product," Mr. Price said. "It
can grow as the company grows. Some companies that end up
buying this product may not use every feature -- yet."
   Earlier this year, in another major attempt to gain market
share in the general business market, MCI announced plans to
acquire Telecom USA for $1.25 billion.
