   SAN FRANCISCO -- Long-term AIDS survivors stand a nearly
50% risk of developing lymph cancer after three years, a
federal scientist said.
   The new and higher figures are scheduled to be presented
today at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS. AIDS
researchers around the country have observed a surge in the
cancer, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma affecting
B-cells.

   But while those reseachers reported a 10% to 20% incidence
of the cancer, Robert Yarchoan of the National Cancer
Institute said that after three years on the medication AZT
for AIDS or severe AIDS related complex (ARC), the risk of
lymphoma runs 46%.
   Researchers so far can only speculate about reasons for
the rise in cancer. "We can't rule out that it's the drug,
but we think it's unlikely," he said. Rather, he said AZT may
be helping fend off death from infecton, but allowing an
erosion of the immune system that permits the cancer to
overtake the body.
   Supporting this thesis, he said patients who developed
lymphoma were so immuno-suppressed that their counts of
infection-fighting T4-cells had declined from a normal level
of about 1000 to a median level of just six.
   "We're concerned that people not become too discouraged
about this," he said. "It simply underscores the point that
retroviruses, the family of viruses to which AIDS belongs,
are oncogenic or cancer-causing viruses."
