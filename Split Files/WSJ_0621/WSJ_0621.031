   VALHI Inc., Dallas, has withdrawn its proposed public
offering of $100 million in convertible subordinated
debentures due 2015, citing unfavorable market conditions.
The preliminary prospectus was offered May 31, but a
subsequent 10-day road show "generated significant interest,
but not at terms acceptable to us," a company executive said.
Valhi, a holding company controlled by Dallas billionaire
Harold Simmons, planned to use the proceeds to accelerate
repayment of debt maturing in 1994. But last week Moody's
Investors Service Inc. assigned a single-B-3 credit rating to
the proposed debentures, saying its assessment of the
proposal included its junior subordinated position and the
superior position of hefty debt at the operating subsidiary
level.
