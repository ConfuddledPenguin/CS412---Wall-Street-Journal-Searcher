   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- President Bush suspended the U.S.
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization because
of its links to an attempted terrorist attack last month. The
step probably puts any talks on Middle East peace in limbo.
   Mr. Bush was reluctant to call off U.S.-PLO discussions,
which began less than two years ago. Announcing the move at a
news conference while on a speaking trip here, Mr. Bush
declared that the U.S. is ready to resume talks "any time"
the PLO more clearly condemns last month's seaborne assault
on Israel and disciplines those responsible.

   And at several points in the news conference, Mr. Bush
stressed the value of the talks the U.S. has held with the
PLO, saying they have "contributed to the peace process" and
have reduced tensions in the Middle East.
   On another pressing foreign-policy issue, Mr. Bush
acknowledged that proposals from France and West Germany for
a big Western economic aid package for the Soviet Union are
likely to be discussed at the meeting of industrialized
nations in Houston early next month. And while he said more
changes are needed in the Soviet system before he could
support an aid package, Mr. Bush indicated he is prepared to
consider the idea.
   "I'm not saying we're not interested," Mr. Bush said. "But
I'm saying there are some formidable obstacles." In
particular, the president said that the U.S. will seek more
market-oriented reforms in the Soviet economy and a
curtailing of the Soviet Union's $5 billion in annual aid to
Cuba before agreeing to any aid program.
   Mr. Bush said he wants the process of change to succeed in
the Soviet Union and said he recognizes "that support from
the West can well help the economy" there. But, he added,
"there's an awful lot of reform that has to take place."
   Mr. Bush insisted that his decision on the PLO dialogue
doesn't have to bring a halt to diplomatic efforts to settle
the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. A few months ago, the Bush
administration thought it had moved close to a breakthrough
in those efforts by finding a formula under which
negotiations could begin between Israel and Palestinian
representatives approved by the PLO.
   But at the last minute, Israel balked at accepting the
formula, and the nation's ruling coalition recently was
replaced by a conservative government more skeptical of peace
talks. Suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue is likely to
freeze any movement by Palestinians toward the negotiating
table as well; most Palestinian leaders profess loyalty to
the PLO and won't enter negotiations without its blessing.
   The immediate danger is that Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will step up
protests against Israeli rule and bring a harsh Israeli
backlash. For that reason, Mr. Bush stressed in his remarks
his willingness to return to talks with the PLO. And Mr. Bush
balanced his move against the PLO by sending some tough
signals to Israel. He said he had just sent a "long letter"
to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir inquiring about the
new Israeli government's "seriousness about the peace
process." He also reiterated his strong opposition to new
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Despite Mr. Bush's reluctance to break off dialogue with
the PLO, the weak reaction of PLO leader Yasser Arafat to the
recent attack on Israel appeared to give the president little
choice. When the U.S. agreed in December 1988 to open a
dialogue with the PLO after years of refusing any contact, it
did so only because Mr. Arafat specifically renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   But Abu Abbas, head of a PLO faction called the Palestine
Liberation Front and a member of the PLO's executive
committee, publicly claimed responsibility for the assault by
Palestinian commandos. Mr. Bush said that the size of the
Palestinian commando force and the target area -- a beach
near Tel Aviv -- "strongly indicate that civilians would have
been the target." He called for "steps to discipline Abu
Abbas."
