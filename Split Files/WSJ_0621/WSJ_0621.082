   EDISON, N.J. -- Midlantic Corp., citing "significant" new
reserves for possible loan losses, said it expects to report
"a modest loss" for the second quarter.
   The bank holding company is one of the major New Jersey
lenders to developer Donald Trump, who has been in a cash
squeeze and is holding negotiations with his lenders. But
Donald W. Ebbert Jr., senior vice president at Midlantic,
said the expected second-quarter loss isn't connected to the
Trump loans.

   Despite the expected loss, Midlantic declared its
quarterly dividend of 47 cents a share on common and said it
expects "to maintain adequate coverage for non-performing
assets."
   A year earlier, net income was $61.6 million, or $1.57 a
share on a fully diluted basis. For all of 1989, net was
$206.3 million, or $5.27 a share.
   Net plunged in this year's first quarter to $1.4 million,
or one cent a share, from $59.5 million, or $1.53 a share,
fully diluted, a year earlier.
   In the first quarter, the company increased its loss
reserves with a provision of $108 million. At the time, it
cited "continuing concerns about current business conditions,
a further decline in the real estate market and an increase
in Midlantic's nonperforming loans."
   Midlantic said the office of the Comptroller of the
Currency is scheduled to examine the company next month "and
the outcome of that review will be communicated to
shareholders at the appropriate time."
   In April, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the
debt ratings of Midlantic and its units.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Midlantic closed at
$15.75, up 50 cents.
