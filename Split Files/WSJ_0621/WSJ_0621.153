   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee approved legislation
that would expand the Securities and Exchange Commission's
power to impose fines on individuals and firms that violate
securities laws.
   The telecommunications and finance panel also passed a
bill aimed at curbing penny-stock fraud, after substantially
changing provisions opposed by the SEC and the securities
industry. Both bills now move to the full Energy and Commerce
Committee.

   The civil-penalties bill, identical in most respects to
legislation recently passed by the Senate Banking Committee,
would give the SEC power to impose monetary penalties for
offenses other than insider trading, for which the agency
currently has fining power. The House bill also gives the SEC
the power to issue cease-and-desist orders to enforce the
securities laws. But compared with the Senate bill, the House
bill includes additional protections for parties subject to
such orders to assure the target's right to due process.
   In the penny-stock bill, the House subcommittee softened a
provision that would have required the creation of an
electronic system to disseminate penny-stock quotes. The
revised bill directs the SEC to adopt rules to improve
dissemination of penny-stock quotes. The revised bill also
directs the SEC to adopt rules providing for increased
disclosure of information about companies that sell penny
stocks to the public.
   Moreover, a provision in the bill that would have banned
so-called blind pools and blank-check offerings was softened
to require the SEC only to increase disclosure requirements
for such offerings. In both types of offerings, the issuers
don't have a business plan or specific assets.
