   UtiliCorp United Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said it expects
to report a 13% drop in its second quarter earnings to $4.8
million, or 12 cents a share, from $5.5 million, or 21 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue is expected to rise 15% to $154 million from $134
million, it said.

   In a presentation to analysts in Columbus, Ohio,
UtiliCorp's chairman, Richard C. Green, said second quarter
results are typically its lowest of the year because of
"normal seasonal declines in gas and electric sales." He also
cited the need for rate relief in key jurisdictions and the
sale in January of income-producing natural gas reserve
properties as reasons for the decline.
   For the first six months, the company said it expects to
earn $27.8 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $432
million. In the previous year, the utility earned $23.1
million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $354 million.
   UtiliCorp said despite the declines in the second quarter,
it is still "on track" for a solid year, provided it receives
adequate rate relief for its Missouri Public Service division
in the fourth quarter.
