   Kuwait's Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the last of the
colorful and brash OPEC oil ministers, has been replaced.
   His reassignment to the post of finance minister of the
Persian Gulf oil power briefly boosted oil markets as some
traders assumed he would no longer be that sheikdom's chief
oil strategist. Others who follow the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, however, cautioned that the
move might not be a repudiation of Sheik Ali's oil policies
so much as an extension of Mideast politics.

   Sheik Ali is being replaced by Rashid Salem Al-Omari, a
Kuwait University professor and chemical engineer who is
virtually unknown outside Kuwait.
   A 44-year-old, London-educated economist, Sheik Ali has
been a vocal advocate of Kuwait pumping oil far above quotas
assigned it by OPEC. Such "cheating" has bloated world oil
supplies and depressed prices. Yesterday, the continuing
crude glut briefly drove prices down to nearly $15 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the last hour,
futures prices for July delivery rebounded somewhat to end at
$15.30 a barrel, still off 35 cents on the day.
   People who monitor OPEC internal affairs suggested the job
change for Sheik Ali may mainly reflect efforts by Kuwait to
accommodate other major Middle Eastern oil producers in
trying to stablize relations in the wake of the Iran-Iraq
war. Sheik Ali has been a thorn in the side of Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq, other powerful Persian Gulf producers who have
generally supported OPEC's production-limiting quotas.
   Indeed, a relaxed Sheik Ali, reached late last night at
his beachhouse in Kuwait, certainly didn't express any
disappointment over his reassignment. On the contrary, he
called it "a new challenge." He added: "I'm looking forward
to working with the domestic economy and Kuwait's
international investments."
   Sheik Ali's reassignment is part of a cabinet shuffle that
saw 11 of 20 positions change.
   Whether or not Kuwait's oil policy changes is immaterial
at the moment, anyway, traders say. Markets are currently
awash in crude oil, with terminals and other storage
facilities almost overflowing. And that doesn't take into
account tankers full of oil afloat on the ocean. Since the
beginning of the month, the price of crude for prompt
delivery has dropped by more than $2 a barrel. It could take
up to eight weeks to work off the excess oil.
   It is understood that Sheik Ali's replacement, Mr.
Al-Omari, is a close friend of Sheik Ali and that as a member
of the sheikdom's Supreme Petroleum Council until only two
months ago, he is familiar with and supportive of Kuwait's
past oil policy.
   Indeed, some who track OPEC believe that Sheik Ali, who
has been oil minister since 1978, will still play a major
role in setting that policy. They insist he isn't being
treated shabbily by his government, or being ousted as Sheik
Ahmed Zaki Yamani was by the Saudi Arabian government in 1986
after tangling with his nation's powerful King Fahd. Sheik
Ali is similar in temperament and showmanship to Sheik
Yamani.
   At one time Kuwait's acting finance minister, Sheik Ali
will be handling a $100 billion investment portfolio in his
new position. Kuwait, the most sophisticated of the Persian
Gulf countries, gets more than half its income from equity
investments and has huge refining networks in other nations
that offset some of the risks of crude oil markets.
   Kuwait, along with the United Arab Emirates, has
flagrantly exceeded its OPEC quota since November even though
Sheik Ali then agreed to honor an allotment of 1.5 million
barrels daily.
   As a result of months of overproduction, Kuwait has been
feeling pressure, particularly from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and
Iran. Saudi King Fahd has repeatedly called for all OPEC
members to honor their quotas. Iraq, which has been growing
in military might since its war with Iran halted, has accused
Kuwait of purposely driving oil prices down to keep Iraq's
war-torn economy in disarray.
   Individuals who follow Middle Eastern political
developments said that during the past month Kuwait has
discussed a possible nonaggression pact with Iraq, and may
negotiate funds to help Iraq develop its oil production
capacity. Removal of Sheik Ali from the high-profile role of
oil minister may be related to such moves, these sources
said.
