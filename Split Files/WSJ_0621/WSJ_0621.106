   HOME DEPOT Inc. (Atlanta) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it raised its rating on the 6 3/4% convertible
subordinated debentures of this building materials and home
improvement company to single-A-2 from single-A-3. The rating
concern said the change affects about $260 million in
long-term debt. Moody's also said it assigned a prospective
single-A-2 rating to Home Depot's proposed $200 million
convertible subordinated debenture issue. Moody's said its
actions are based on its expectation that Home Depot will
continue to show superior cash flow and returns.
