   Family Circumstances
   Tied to Dropping Out

   ONE IN FIVE eighth graders is at serious risk of failing
in school or dropping out before graduating from high school,
the Department of Education reports.
   Researchers for the department used six common indicators
of "at-risk" status: coming from a single-parent family,
coming from a household with income below $15,000, being home
alone more than three hours a day, having a dropout as a
sibling, having limited English skills and having parents who
didn't finish high school.
   A 1988 survey of nearly 25,000 eighth-graders in 1,000
public and private schools nationwide found that 53% had no
risk factors and 26% had one. But just over 20% had two or
more. These students already showed low grades and high
absenteeism. The study will follow the sample as they move
through high school and beyond, trying to identify factors
fostering or hindering success in school.
   Along similar lines, a Louis Harris &amp; Associates survey
last year for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., covering 2,000
public school teachers in all grades, found them increasingly
concerned over student behavioral problems.
   Over half consider absenteeism a serious problem, and
three in four worry about the number of latchkey children,
those left on their own after school. Compared with a similar
survey only four years earlier, much higher percentages of
junior high and high school teachers list student drinking,
drug use, teen-age pregnancy, dropouts and suicide as serious
problems.
                                                                                                       

   Growth Will Make '90s
   A Billion-Person Decade
                                                                                                       

   FERTILITY RATES are inching up in a few low-fertility
countries, including the U.S., but continue to decline in
many high-fertility countries.
   Still, says the Population Reference Bureau, a private
research group in Washington, the 1990s will see the largest
increase in the world's population of any decade yet, adding
another billion people to the present 5.3 billion. It took 11
years to add the last billion. By mid-1998, the bureau
believes, the global population will surpass six billion.
   The bureau's Carl Haub says the fertility rate has
rebounded from extremely low levels in several developed
countries. Government and private demographers now estimate
that the total fertility rate in the U.S. last year was 2.0
-- the highest since 1972, though still below the 2.1
replacement rate. The total fertility rate is the number of
likely lifetime births per woman.
   The U.S. rate fell from a postwar high of 3.77 in 1957 to
a low of 1.7 in 1976, then hovered around 1.8 for a decade.
But the 1988 rate crept up to 1.9, and the 1989 rate
apparently edged up further.
   Sweden, West Germany, Iceland and Finland also have seen
turnarounds. In Sweden, the rate fell to 1.6 in the early
1980s, but has climbed back to 2.0. West Germany, which fell
below 1.3 in 1985, has turned up to 1.4.
   Demographers note that starting in the 1970s, more young
women delayed childbearing into their 30s, reducing the
fertility rate. Now, these women are finally having their
children, helping to nudge the rate back up. Many specialists
say it's too early to tell whether there is also a movement
back to slightly larger families.
   Bangladesh, Egypt and China are among countries
experiencing substantial declines in fertility rates. Mr.
Haub figures Rwanda now has the world's highest rate, an
estimated 8.3, while Italy's 1.3 is the lowest.
                                                                                                       

   Voting-Age Populace
   Is Becoming Grayer
                                                                                                       

   BABY BOOMERS and old folks bulk ever larger in the
voting-age population.
   The Census Bureau says the number of men and women 18
years old and over will exceed 186 million by this fall's
congressional elections, nearly eight million higher than in
the 1986 off-year vote. Almost 82 million -- about 44% of
this fall's total -- will be in the 25-to-44 age range, born
during the baby boom years. This age group accounted for only
38.5% of the total in 1980.
   Of course, a large share of the voting-age population
doesn't get around to voting. In the 1986 congressional
elections, only one-third actually voted.
   The 65-plus age group will be 6.2 million larger this fall
than in 1980, accounting for about 17% of the voting-age
population. The relative size of the 18-to-24 group has
shrunk by one-quarter in the past decade, to 14% of this
fall's total, while the 45-to-64 bracket has increased
slightly in numbers but shrunk as a percentage of the whole.
   Women of voting age continue to outnumber men. They will
make up 52% of the voting-age population and three out of
five of those 65 and over.
   Over 21 million blacks will be of voting age this fall, or
11.3% of the total. In 1980, their percentage was 10.6%.
About 11 million live in the South, accounting for 17% of the
area's voting-age population.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   PROBLEMS with fertility put serious emotional burdens on
both marriage partners, but the stress on the wife is
considerably greater than that on the husband, psychologist
Frank Andrews and colleagues at the University of Michigan
report. . . . Nearly two out of three Americans believe
Medicare benefits will shrink by the time they retire,
according to a Gallup Organization poll for the Employee
Benefit Research Institute. The younger the respondent, the
greater the concern. . . . Jobs that require pregnant women
to stand for long hours substantially increase the risk of
premature delivery, says a group of Yale Medical School
epidemiologists.
