   Donald Trump should go see "Gremlins 2, The New Batch."
This amusing sequel is built around an avaricious New York
landlord, conglomerateur and best-selling author named Daniel
Clamp who likes to name his holdings after himself. Like his
real life counterpart, Clamp faces the destruction of his
empire by outside forces. But Clamp triumphs over adversity,
and Mr. Trump should be cheered by his uncanny ability to
turn potential disaster into a marketing triumph.
   "Gremlins 2," which is infinitely more entertaining than
the 1984 original, has moved its mixture of comedy and horror
to New York City from Kingston Falls. With the change of
venue, the film makers dropped the phony sentimental sheen
that made "Gremlins" seem so heartlessly calculated. Now
they've exposed and polished the nasty edge to their gleeful
humor, which couldn't be more appropriate to the setting, the
electronically controlled wasteland of Clamp Centre.

   In this cold gray monster of a building, everything runs
by automation: the revolving doors, the elevators, the
lights. Water fountains spurt without touch, computerized
voices announce themselves in the most inappropriate settings
("Welcome to the men's room," says one, for example. "Hey
pal. I hope you washed your hands"). Even the humans who run
the place are automated. When Clamp's chief operations man
comes upon gremlins ripping and tearing things apart, he
mutters: "This is a complete failure of management."
   Anyone who lives or works amid this kind of technological
"advancement" can't help but feel warmly toward the gruesome
gremlins who wreak havoc on the Clamp Centre. Director Joe
Dante and his special-effects technicians have dreamed up the
most ingenious ways for these mean-spirited little monsters
to search and destroy.
   As sequels must, this one spends some time explaining the
original movie to the audience. But the film makers dispatch
the boilerplate handily. For those who have managed to forget
the ubiquitous marketing campaign that accompanied "Gremlins"
the first time: The creatures must be kept away from sunlight
(or they'll be killed); from water (or they'll mulitiply);
from food after midnight (or they'll be transmogrified into
something awful).
   Once again the gremlins start out cute, like the little
guy named Gizmo. Gizmo finds himself about to become an
experimental subject in the genetics lab that operates in the
Clamp Centre. There he meets up with his old friends Billy
and Kate (Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates), the young couple
from Kingston Falls who have grown up and relocated to New
York. Urban but not yet urbane, they have remained
companionably dull and still are able to perform their
function -- to chase and be chased by gremlins when required.
   The rest of the cast has much more pep, especially
Haviland Morris as Marla Bloodstone. Done up like a '50s
comedy vision of a career gal (tortoise-shell glasses and
bright red lips and nails), Ms. Morris has a nice comic
nasality. And John Glover's Clamp looks like a caricaturist's
Donald Trump. But then so does Donald Trump.
   The story is the usual: Creepy things take over a house
and what are the humans to do? But what makes this picture
enjoyable are the endlessly imaginative ways the film makers
have deployed the gremlins. Once again Mr. Dante and his crew
do a gremlinization of pop culture. There's a gremlin doing
Olivier in "Marathon Man"; another gremlin does Frank Sinatra
singing "New York, New York" with a massive chorus of gremlin
backup singers. I won't give away the most ingenious moment
of gremlinatrics: Just remember, don't leave the theater too
soon.

   "Gremlins 2," however, appears to be the exception that
proves the rule: Sequels aren't as much fun.
   That's certainly the case with the unexceptional "Another
48 Hours." Director Walter Hill's dramatically choreographed
episodes of violence and mayhem have become tedious, like a
child who knows how to do triple somersaults and nothing
else, and insists on repeating the trick over and over again.
It's rather astonishing to watch at first, then monotonous,
then irritating.
   The unlikely pairing of criminal and cop wasn't really
what made the first movie so entertaining. It was the early
appearance of young Eddie Murphy, startling everyone with his
fast and funny mouth. Mr. Murphy isn't really the problem
here, except to the extent that he is now so powerful he
could easily be somewhere else. He and Nick Nolte, the
reluctant partner, don't walk through their parts. They
couldn't even if they wanted to: The parts are so soft the
actors can't help but sink.
   When people aren't getting blown apart, or glass isn't
shattering, the picture is devoted to the bringing-up-to-date
process. This leaves the viewer much time to ponder the
current cinema: Why must the bad guys always be drug dealers?
Why are they always hip black guys or unwashed motorcycle
gangsters? Why do they always have such bad skin? Will there
be "Yet Another 48 Hours?"

   VIDEO TIP: Unlikely pairings have always been a favorite
subject for Hollywood film makers. One of the sweetest and
funniest was the O'Neal match, when a young Ryan and a very
young Tatum played a con man and kid in the delightful "Paper
Moon," back in 1973. No drug dealers, no shattered glass.
