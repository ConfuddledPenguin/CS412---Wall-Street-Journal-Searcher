   Henry Nau, senior staffer at the National Security Council
from 1981 to 1983, writing in the March/April issue of the
International Economy:

   The Bretton Woods standards did not subordinate domestic
growth to international stability, as critics of U.S. dollar
policy began to argue in the 1960s; nor did they manipulate
international mechanisms such as exchange rates to
accommodate domestic expansion or inflation, as was done in
the 1970s. They recognized that domestic and international
stability and growth were directly interrelated. If domestic
prices began to diverge in the major countries, international
prices or exchange rates would also have to diverge. If
domestic economies became increasingly inflexible, countries
increasingly would have to make their balance of payments
adjustments through borrowing or through trade, exchange
rate, and capital market restrictions. There was no way to
have your cake and eat it, too. Domestic and international
policies depended upon one another: Domestic policies
couldn't succeed without international competition, and
international cooperation could not compensate for
undisciplined domestic policies.
