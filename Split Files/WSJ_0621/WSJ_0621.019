   LONDON -- Delegates to a world environment conference
appear poised to endorse a global ban by 2000 on
chloroflourocarbons and many other ozone-destroying
chemicals.
   As a ten-day meeting on protecting the world's ozone layer
opened here yesterday, delegates from the U.S., Britain and
other countries expressed confidence that they will reach
agreement on tougher protective measures. Besides the global
CFC elimination, the measures are expected to include
creation of an international fund of at least $160 million to
help developing countries convert their industries to non-CFC
technologies.

   The measures will take the form of amendments next week to
an international accord negotiated in Montreal in 1987. The
Montreal Protocol committed the world's developed countries
and many developing nations to a 50% drop by mid-1998 in
production and consumption of CFCs and several related
chemicals. CFCs are used widely as refrigerants, industrial
solvents, aerosols and foam-blowing agents. Scientific
research has found the man-made gases are eating away the
atmosphere's natural layer of ozone gas, which helps protect
life on the planet from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
