   MARK IV INDUSTRIES Inc. said it obtained a $300 million
credit facility with a bank group led by Continental Bank and
Security Pacific National Bank. The Amherst, N.Y., maker of
technical products and systems said the new financing
arrangement replaces an existing $125 million revolving
credit facility. It added that the financing would not only
meet internal needs, but could be used to make acquisitions
or to purchase its stock or debt. The new credit facility
consists of a three-year revolving loan that can be converted
into a four-year term loan, the company said.
