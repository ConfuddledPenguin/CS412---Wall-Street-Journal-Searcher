   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. boosted to $2.25
billion from $1.5 billion its unusual offering of zero-coupon
bonds convertible into cash tied to the market price of Euro
Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French company.
   The offering size was increased at the request of Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., the issue underwriter, because of investor
demand, Disney said. Even before the offering was increased,
it was believed to be the largest convertible bond issue
ever.

   Gross proceeds are expected to be about $927 million,
Disney said. In addition, the entertainment concern has
granted an option to Merrill Lynch to acquire additional
notes to cover overallotments, which, if fully exercised,
would increase the offering to $2.59 billion, with gross
proceeds of about $1.07 billion.
   Disney has said the funds would be used for capital
spending and to retire more expensive commercial paper
outstanding. In January, Walt Disney announced a
multibillion-dollar expansion of its theme parks and resorts
in Florida and California over the next decade.
   The bonds, called Liquid Yield Option Notes, pay a yield
of 6% to maturity. They have been priced at $411.99, and will
be exchangeable for cash equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent
of the market value of 19.65 shares of Euro Disneyland common
stock.
   Euro Disneyland, a theme park and resort complex near
Paris, is scheduled to open in 1992. The company is listed on
stock exchanges in Paris, London and Brussels, and is 49%
owned by Walt Disney Co. It closed at the equivalent of
$18.23 on the Paris exchange.
