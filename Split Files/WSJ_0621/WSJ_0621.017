   TOKYO -- Japan's powerful Finance Ministry is turning sour
on the idea that the country's huge external surpluses are
good for the world.
   Just two weeks ago, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
welcomed an advisory committee report suggesting that Japan
should determine an "appropriate" level for its surpluses.
The committee and others in Japan took the view that
surpluses could help finance the voracious capital appetites
of Eastern Europe and other investment-starved areas.

   But now, under fire from U.S. officials and rival Japanese
bureaucracies, even the Finance Ministry seems to be cooling
on the "surpluses are good" view. Makoto Utsumi, vice finance
minister for international affairs, said in an interview that
reducing Japan's huge current-account surpluses remains "a
very important pillar" of Japan's economic policies. (The
current account measures trade in merchandise, plus
"invisible" trade that includes services, insurance, tourism
and remittances from workers abroad.)
   Mr. Utsumi insisted that the Finance Ministry had never
explicitly adopted the view that surpluses are good, and he
derided the notion that the ministry was at odds with other
ministries as a "battle of headlines without substance."
There was, he said, "some kind of confusion between the
necessity of savings and the necessity of current-account
surpluses."
   Still, the tone of his remarks differs sharply from the
line pushed by Japanese financial opinion leaders only a few
weeks ago. "I can clearly say that we have no intention to
justify our trade surpluses or current-account surplus," Mr.
Utsumi said. "We feel that we should try our best to further
the adjustment process."
   The retreat on the surplus issue doesn't necessarily mean
that Japan is relaxing its opposition to U.S. demands for
sharply increased Japanese public-works spending. Indeed, Mr.
Utsumi warned against "too much expansion in the public
sector."
   The public-works issue is likely to come to a head again
next week in talks in Tokyo between U.S. and Japanese
officials. U.S. officials argue that increasing public-works
spending would reduce Japan's external surpluses by using at
home capital that currently goes abroad. Mr. Utsumi declined
to comment directly on the talks, but he suggested that he
wants to avoid any commitments that could put Japanese policy
on an inflationary track.
   Refuting arguments that Japan needs to maintain its
surpluses to help capital-starved countries, Mr. Utsumi
argued that Japan can both reduce its surpluses and funnel
capital abroad. He cited figures showing that Japan's
long-term capital outflows in recent years have far exceeded
its current-account surpluses.
   Japan has reduced its surpluses "drastically" in the past
few years, he said, and should continue to do so by pursuing
policies that promote strong "noninflationary growth led by
domestic demand." What Japan should avoid, Mr. Utsumi said,
is a combination of loose fiscal policy and tight monetary
policy.
