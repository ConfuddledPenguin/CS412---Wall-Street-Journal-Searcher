   LONDON -- Net new investment in U.K. unit trusts totaled
#191.9 million ($330.3 million) in May, up more than 12 times
from #15.6 million in April, the Unit Trust Association said.
   The latest month's figure for the trusts, similar to
open-ended mutual funds, is down 12% from the #219.4 million
in net new investment recorded a year earlier.

   The value of funds under management by association members
rose 7.1% to #57.1 billion from #53.3 billion in April and
10% from #51.7 billion a year earlier.
   The association attributed the performance to the upturn
in the value of both the U.K. and other major world stock
markets during the month.
   Sales of unit trust shares to investors were up 13% to
#754 million in May from #666 million in April but were off
2.2% from #771 million in May 1989.
   Repurchases of the shares dropped 13% to #562 million in
May from #650 million in April but rose 1.8% from #552
million a year earlier.
