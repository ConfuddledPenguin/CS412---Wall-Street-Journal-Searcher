   HOUSTON -- Keystone International Inc. said that under its
new rights plan it will give holders of its common stock one
depositary preferred share purchase right for each common
share held.
   The manufacturer of flow-control products said the rights
take effect upon accumulation of 20% or more of the company's
common and weren't adopted in response to "any specific
effort to acquire control of the company." The rights expire
in March 2000.
