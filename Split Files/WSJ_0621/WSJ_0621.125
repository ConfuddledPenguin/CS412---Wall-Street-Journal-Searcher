   NEW YORK -- New notes and bonds continued to flood the
credit market yesterday, as more than $5.5 billion of
asset-backed, municipal and corporate debt was offered to
investors.
   Dealers said the huge supply, coming on top of $3 billion
of new debt issued Tuesday, overwhelmed demand and put
downward pressure on bond prices.

   In trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell
nearly 1/2 point, or $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
its price, rose to 8.51%.
   The large volume of new bonds issued yesterday "was a big
contributing factor to the down move," in bond prices, said
Joel Kazis, a trading manager at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. He said that some dealers, who may have held large
inventories of unsold corporate, asset-backed and municipal
bonds, were hedging their positions by selling Treasury notes
and bonds.
   "There's not enough retail participation in this market,"
said Mr. Kazis. "I don't know where all this supply is
going."
   Surprisingly, among the best selling issues yesterday was
Chrysler Corp.'s $1 billion of securities backed by auto
loans. Even though the auto maker's debt has been downgraded
recently and is under review for further possible downgrade,
investors had a strong appetite for the securities.
   The Chrysler issue, which has an expected average life of
1.58 years, was priced at 99.855 with a coupon of 9.25% to
yield 9.27% by Salomon Brothers Inc.
   But several municipal bond and several asset-backed issues
that were offered yesterday and Tuesday are having problems
being placed.
   The market was also hurt by news that Australia's Westpac
Banking Corp. will close its Westpac Pollock Government
Securities Inc. subsidiary immediately. Westpac Pollock was a
primary dealer of government securities, an exclusive and
highly competitive group of bond dealers that do business
directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Bond prices moved lower on the news as investors worried
that Westpac might dump its inventory. "If they are going out
of business, they have to get rid of that inventory and that
means more supply," said Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio
manager at Dreyfus Corp.
   The market also received negative news in the form of the
latest edition of the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book," which
reported that there is continued slow growth in the economy
with little change in the underlying inflation rate.
   In a market where investors thrive on bad news, the Beige
Book findings were a "disappointment," said Christopher
Rupkey, a financial economist at Mitsubishi Bank. "People
thought the report would show that the economy was
deteriorating," but instead it showed that the economy is
growing slowly, he said.
   The Beige Book is a summary of economic activity prepared
for use at the central bank's next Federal Open Market
Committee meeting, on July 2 to 3.
   Late in the day, bond prices slipped further when the
Treasury announced it will hold record auctions next week for
two-year and four-year notes. The Treasury announced it will
sell a record $11.25 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday
and will sell a record $8.25 billion of four-year notes next
Wednesday.
   In when-issued activity that kicked off immediately after
the Treasury's announcement, the new two-year notes are
quoted at a yield of 8.39% while the new four-year notes were
quoted at 8.49%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. gyrated wildly as
high-yield investors flocked to trade the bonds following a
report that a major refinancing of RJR is under way.
   Traders estimate more than $500 million of RJR's widely
held payment-in-kind bonds were exchanged yesterday in
extremely volatile trading. Payment-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities instead of
cash.
   The hectic activity was sparked by an article in
yesterday's Wall Street Journal that reported that RJR
Nabisco and its main shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., have begun a refinancing effort that will include the
retirement of more than $4 billion of RJR's junk bonds.
   In response, RJR's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind
debentures, due in 2009, finished up 6 1/4 points at 97 1/8
on the New York Stock Exchange. The 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended 4 1/4 points
higher at 80 5/8.
   The advance in the RJR bonds triggered gains in other
actively traded high-yield securities with most issues
climbing between 1/4 to 1/2 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of municipal bonds fell between 1/8 and 3/8 points
yesterday as a deluge of new supply overwhelmed demand.
   Among the largest new issues yesterday was Massachusetts'
$453 million in general obligation bonds. The bonds were
priced to yield from 6.10% for bonds that mature in the year
1991 to 7.50% for zero-coupon bonds, also called capital
appreciation bonds, that mature in 2001 and 2002. Zeros pay
no interest and are issued at a deep discount to face amount.
   Massachusetts now has the lowest credit rating of any
state and its debt is currently under review for further
possible downgrade. Still, underwriters at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. said the bonds were well received by investors, due in
part because the bonds carried different forms of bondholder
protection such as bond insurance and a letter of credit from
several Japanese banks and one U.S. bank.
   Many of the other seven new municipal issues that were
offered yesterday were not as successful.
   Ahead on the calendar, the District of Columbia will sell
$50 million 3 1/2-month general obligation tax and revenue
anticipation notes today.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 13/32
to yield 8.51% compared with 102 27/32 to yield 8.47% on
Tuesday. Ten-year notes ended at a price of 102 4/32 to yield
8.53% compared with 102 11/32 to yield 8.50%.
   Treasury bill rates were little changed yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Debt issuance in the investment-grade corporate debt
market was extremely heavy as more than $3 billion of debt
was priced.
   Among the highlights of the session was Walt Disney Co.'s
$2.25 billion offering of zero-coupon convertible
subordinated notes.
   The securities were priced at $411.99 per $1,000
redemption amount for a yield to maturity of 6% through
underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The bonds are convertible into cash equal to the market
price of Euro Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French
company established to build and operate Euro Disneyland.
   The offering is the largest convertible-bond issue ever
and represents the first time that a zero-coupon bond
purchased by U.S. investors is convertible into the cash
equivalent of the price of a foreign stock.
   The debt sale will result in proceeds to the entertainment
concern of about $927 million.
   Investor demand for the issue was so strong that the size
was increased from an originally planned $1.5 billion.

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, resumed their
upward climb yesterday as international investors scrambled
to buy new securities.
   Gilts have been rising for weeks on speculation that
sterling will soon join the European Monetary System's
exchange-rate mechanism. Joining the ERM could be good for
gilts because it could help to stabilize the pound, force
Britain to contain inflation and eventually lead to lower
interest rates.
   In the most recent ERM news, Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major discussed the issue in a speech yesterday. Mr.
Major repeated Britain's firm commitment to joining the ERM
when the government's "well-known conditions are met." Those
include a decline in British inflation close to the average
level in other EMS countries.
   Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% issue due 2003/2007
ended 1 3/8 points higher at 103 1/4 to yield 11.27% while
the 12% security due 1995 rose 23/32 to 100 13/32 to yield
11.89%. (Yields are quoted in local terms, but would be
slightly lower if calculated using the semiannual compound
measure used in the U.S.)
   In other markets, West German bonds ended modestly firmer
in quiet trading. Japanese government bonds ended weaker with
the yen, moving in a very narrow range due to the lack of
fresh economic or technical information.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices finished with modest
losses of 1/4 point or less.
   The mortgage securities market experienced "a slow day,"
said one trader. He said there was "a bid list out for short
CMOs," which are collateralized mortgage obligations, "that
was very well received."
   Otherwise, activity centered on the primary market, where
several real estate mortgage investment conduit issues and
another huge asset-backed offering, this one from Chrysler,
were priced.
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues for July delivery were down 7/32 at
98 3/4, 10% securities were down 5/32 at 101 7/32; Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were off 6/32 at 98
3/32, 10% issues were 5/32 lower at 100 5/32; Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were off 6/32
at 98 19/32, 10% securities were down 7/32 at 100 5/8.
