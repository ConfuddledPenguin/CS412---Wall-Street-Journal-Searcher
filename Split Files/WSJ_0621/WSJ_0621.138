   Brambles Industries Ltd., Sydney, Australia, responding to
inquiries by the Australian Stock Exchange, said it hasn't
sold any of its stock in Environmental Systems Co.
   The exchange's inquiries came in response to an
Environmental Systems report last week that Brambles, its
largest shareholder, had decided to "unwind" its position.
Jack W. Forrest, president of the Little Rock, Ark.,
hazardous-waste processor, said at the time that he believed
an investment banking firm representing Brambles was
soliciting interest in buying the stock.

   Brambles, which owns through subsidiaries about 23% of
Environmental Systems' common shares outstanding, declined to
comment. But following the Australian exchange's request,
Brambles yesterday said it reviews its market options on a
continuing basis and "the option of stock sales was
specifically evaluated as one aspect of this consideration."
However, no sales were made and currently none are
contemplated.
