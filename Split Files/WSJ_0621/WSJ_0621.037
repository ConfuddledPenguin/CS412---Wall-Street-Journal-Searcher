   The mounting financial woes many state and local
governments face these days could mean opportunity for shrewd
investors.
   When municipal-finance news is grim, that often is the
best time to find bargains in tax-free bonds.

   Remember New York City's financial crisis of the
mid-1970s? Investors who were smart enough back then to buy
long-term bonds issued by the city or Municipal Assistance
Corp. have done exceptionally well.
   Bad news can force state and local governments, as well as
other municipal issuers, to offer higher yields to attract
investors. Some investment-grade tax-free bonds now yield
nearly 8% -- the equivalent of about 11% on a taxable bond
for an investor in the 28% federal income-tax bracket. By
comparison, top-rated state bonds now yield about 7%.
   Moreover, investors who buy the bonds of battered
governments also have the opportunity for capital
appreciation in the years ahead, as the issuer works through
its problems and the market price of its securities rises.
   But spotting such buys isn't easy. Even the professionals
who manage municipal bond mutual funds acknowledge that
bargain-hunting is increasingly tricky, because the finances
of so many state and local governments appear precarious.
   "Credit conditions are deteriorating nationally,
especially in the Northeast," warns Freda Johnson, a
consultant who previously headed the municipal-finance
department at Moody's Investors Service Inc. "I expect more
municipal downgrades this year than upgrades from all the
major rating agencies."
   Though defaults are comparatively rare, they do occur. In
most cases, though, the far bigger danger for investors is
that the market value of their bonds can plummet quickly if
the issuer runs into problems. While investors who can hold
the bonds until maturity shouldn't fret, those who need their
money sooner might have to sell at a loss.
   To minimize the risk to their own financial well-being,
investors eager to capitalize on municipal issuers' woes
shouldn't go overboard. The core of their municipal bond
portfolio should be mainly issues that have high ratings,
investment managers and financial analysts say.
   Municipal bonds should represent "the conservative portion
of an investor's portfolio," says Christine Carter Lynch,
managing editor of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a
newsletter. "They should have predictable income, and you
should be able to count on them without question."
   This also means people shouldn't put all of their tax-free
portfolio into a single-state municipal bond fund. These are
mutual funds that buy bonds issued only by that state and its
municipalities, which makes their interest income exempt from
all federal, state and local income taxes for investors who
are residents of that state. As a result, they are extremely
popular and are proliferating rapidly.
   But the lack of geographical diversity means that if a
state runs into financial problems, the total return -- this
includes price changes, as well as interest income -- can
suffer. "If you live in a high-income-tax state, you
generally do want to own bonds from your own state, or you
want to own specialty-state bond funds," says Aaron S.
Gurwitz, vice president in fixed-income research at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. Nevertheless, he says, "You might also want to
have some diversification to hedge against deterioration of
your own state's economy."
   Investors also shouldn't assume that all triple-A-rated
bonds will always be able to retain their high ratings,
municipal-finance specialists say. For example, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. has placed two top-rated issues, New Jersey and
North Carolina, on its CreditWatch list of ratings that are
subject to a possible downgrade.
   Don't be panicked by a downgrade, however. Frequently, the
news has been so widely expected by professional bond traders
that it has little or no effect when it finally occurs. Even
if a rating change does catch traders by surprise and drives
a bond's price down, it is often best for individual
investors to step back and wait for the smoke to clear. An
investor who tries to sell quickly can get caught in a crush
of sellers trying to squeeze through the same small door.
   As for bargain-hunting, the pros say to look for
turnaround situations. These are bonds with prices that have
been hammered hard this year, but the state's financial
situation finally may be improving.
   Some analysts are especially bullish on bonds of
Southwestern states, where they expect strong economic growth
in coming years after many lean years. Earlier this month,
the Commerce Department projected that Southwestern states,
such as Nevada, will lead the nation in economic growth
through the end of the century. Moreover, if oil prices turn
around, as some analysts predict, this could benefit bonds
from the Oil Patch region, such as Texas and Louisiana.
   New York's bonds tumbled earlier this year, hurt by the
state's economic weakness and a lengthy, bitter budget
battle. Lately, though, a few fund managers say prices have
fallen so much that the bonds are looking increasingly
attractive.
   "I see a buying opportunity here," says Peter J.D. Gordon,
a managing director at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in
Baltimore. "The worst news on New York probably is behind
us."
   New York state's long-term bonds are rated single-A, one
of the lowest ratings in the nation, by both Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's. New York state long-term bonds yield about
7.4%. "I would doubt the New York state situation would
deteriorate significantly further," says Ms. Johnson, the
public-finance consultant.
   Municipal bond specialists also suggest looking beyond
"general obligation bonds," which are backed by the issuers'
full faith and taxing ability. Some "revenue bonds," which
are backed by revenues generated by the entity being
financed, offer excellent value, says Neal Attermann, vice
president and manager of municipal-bond research at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co.
   For example, he recommends New York State Power Authority
long-term bonds, now yielding more than 7.25%.
   Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at Gabriele,
Hueglin &amp; Cashman, is bullish on some bonds that he says have
been tarnished with a bad image. For example, he cites bonds
issued by Washington Public Power Supply System on behalf of
nuclear power plant Units 1, 2 and 3. Many investors will
never forget or forgive WPPSS, popularly known as "Whoops,"
for defaulting on a record $2.25 billion of bonds in 1983 for
Units 4 and 5.
   "I like bonds of WPPSS 1, 2 and 3," Mr. Hueglin says,
"because they still are undervalued, due to the bad publicity
WPPSS has received" for its record default.
   Several analysts agree, however, that investors should
steer clear of most lower-rated hospital bonds and industrial
development bonds. Last year, S&amp;P cut its ratings on 36
hospital issues, while raising them on only 12. And in this
year's first quarter, S&amp;P lowered ratings on 14 issues, while
raising only five.
   To help protect against unexpected interest-rate changes,
the pros suggest "laddering," that is, buying bonds with a
wide range of maturities, ranging from very short-term to
long-term. Some investors arrange their holdings so that part
of their bond holdings comes due each year. If rates surge,
short-term bonds look best; if rates plunge, long-term bonds
benefit. Similarly, mutual fund investors can sprinkle their
holdings among bond funds with varying maturities.
   Safety-conscious investors also should consider tax-free
bonds backed by U.S. Treasury issues, known as "escrowed" or
"pre-refunded" bonds, says Mr. Hueglin. He says these bonds
combine the "highest quality and tradability on the market
with little yield sacrifice."
