   I couldn't help but laugh as I read about the difficulty
of persuading the public to use debit cards and merchants to
install point-of-sale terminals so they can be used (Law, May
9: "Cashless Society May Be Inching Toward Reality").
   You see, the future is now in Iowa. Every ATM in the state
is connected through a single central switching system, so it
makes no difference whose card you've got when you want to
use a point-of-sale terminal or just get some cash from an
ATM.

   Thanks to this universality, ATMs are everywhere and
point-of-sale terminals are to be found in both large and
small grocery stores. Need some cash? Just hit the nearest
"money machine" or get that extra $10 or even $50 with your
grocery purchase with no thought about which bank has the ATM
or which is "your" bank.
   It's easier than writing a check. No photo driver's
license or other form of identification is required and the
store's limit on cash back may be higher than for a check.
   There is one slight catch, but it affects only
"foreigners." The Iowa network is connected to Cirrus, so
pack your Plus System card away as you cross the state line
and bring plenty of cash with you unless you've also got a
Cirrus Card.
