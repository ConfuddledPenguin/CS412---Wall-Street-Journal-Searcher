   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Pinkerton's Inc. said it completed a
refinancing that includes the private placement of $60
million in 10-year, senior notes with two insurance
companies, which weren't identified, and the establishment of
a new, $50 million line of credit with a banking group led by
Citicorp, New York.
   The security and investigative concern also said a
competitor's lawsuit was dismissed recently by a federal
court in New York. The litigation, filed in April by
Guardsmark Inc., a private security services company based in
Memphis, Tenn., alleged that Pinkerton's engaged in unfair
and deceptive practices in the use of a personality
assessment test to screen prospective employees.

   The new senior notes bear a 10.35% interest rate and
include provisions for sinking funds in the final six years.
The $50 million line of credit consists of a $40 million
letter-of-credit facility and a $10 million revolving line of
credit.
   Proceeds from the new financing will be used to repay
about $55 million in term and subordinated debt with higher
interest rates. Pinkerton's has said it will take a $2.6
million accounting charge as an extraordinary item in the
current quarter to write off deferred financing charges
related to the earlier debt.
