   Tokyo stocks settled higher after bouncing up and down
within a moderate range. Traders said that rounds of
arbitrage buying and scattered buying on incentive issues
added strength to the indexes.
   But performance on currency and bond markets was
disappointing, putting a cap on aggressive buying, traders
said.

   Meanwhile, London stocks finished a quiet session narrowly
mixed and little changed, as traders said investors awaited
the end of the quarter before opening fresh positions.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 47.38 points to
32087.76, after falling 336.42 points Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index added
another 51.33 points to 32139.09.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, up from 335 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outpaced decliners 492 to 446, while 193 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section gained 12.87 points, or 0.55%, to 2366.80. The
second section index rose 2.52 points, or 0.06%, to 4147.58
on volume estimated at 23 million shares, off from 24.5
million shares Tuesday.
   Trading yesterday morning was lackluster, as softer yen
and bond performances led to unenthusiastic activity, while
scattered arbitrage buying lent some support.
   But traders said that professional investors sifted
through prospects for strong research-oriented companies,
buying shares that also seemed underpriced.
   The bargain hunting on incentive-backed issues remained
strong all day, as dealers passed the shares on to their
customers, who lured in the broader market, observers said.
   One domestic trader mentioned that talk among dealers in
the morning included theories that foreign investors,
particularly from the U.S., will get out of long cash
positions overseas and place their money in Japanese stocks.
"Especially in New York, many feel the market is overheated
and won't be improving for some time," he said.
   The Japanese trader felt that some dealers acted on the
speculation, resulting in the initial buying on
incentive-backed issues.
   On the other hand, financial conditions haven't really
turned to favor yen investments, observers noted.
   From an equity point of view, the dollar-yen rate has been
trapped in an unattractive range for some time, with little
sign of breaking out of its range, traders said.
   "There's a very interesting tug-of-war going on" with the
relationship between the markets, said Julian Jones, an
equity salesman at W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. The battle increases
investors' attention to bond-yield movements.
   The market is unlikely to make any large movement until it
receives a firm indication of the currency's direction, Mr.
Jones said.
   Arbitrage and other types of index-linked buying,
meanwhile, is keeping the market from falling on weak
fundamentals, traders said. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers
and Baring Securities were underlined as key players.
   A chief trader at a midsized Japanese securities firm
submitted that yesterday was the settlement date for pension
fund assessment, so firms would naturally push for a higher
result on the cash index, he said.
   Notable gainers included NTT, which advanced 70000 yen to
1.15 million yen ($456 to $7,494). According to a local news
service report, the company's chairman hinted that there is
potential for a gratis issue.
   Tokyo Steel rose 100 yen to 4950 yen, while Fuji Photo
Film gained 100 yen to 4390 yen, both boosted by
incentive-backed dealer buying, traders said.
   Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which Tuesday disclosed news on a
new drug to be targeted for testing in the U.S., Soviet
Union, Japan and Western Europe, rose 70 yen to 2100 yen.
   In London, dealers said institutional investors generally
have stated that they're content with the profits they have
made so far during the second quarter and are awaiting the
start of the next quarter for any new investment.
   In addition, the running of the Royal Ascot horse race
kept many participants out of the market, dealers said, as
did a mediocre start to Wall Street and a dearth of major
U.K. corporate or economic news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
1.5 points to 2371.2, off the midmorning best level of
2384.5, but well above the early morning minimum of 2369.6.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 4 points to
1903.4. Volume reached a sketchy 436.8 million shares,
compared with 408.3 million issues Tuesday.
   Among the major losers on the day was Imperial Chemical
Industries, Britain's largest chemical concern. The stock
fell 30 pence to #11.82 (52 cents to $20.37) on news that the
U.S. Commerce Department is suing eight corporations,
including an ICI unit, for allegedly polluting the coastal
waters off California.
   Also falling was drug maker Wellcome, which shed 34 pence
to 633 pence after an earnings downgrade by brokerage firm
S.G. Warburg, and worries over emerging competition for the
company's Retrovir drug used to combat the effects of the HIV
virus.
   Defense stocks continued to tailspin after the British
government Monday said it is canceling an order for 33
Tornado aircraft. British Aerospace lost 26 pence to 520
pence, GEC shed 11 pence to 197 pence, Rolls-Royce slipped 2
pence to 215 pence, while Vickers dropped a penny to 232
pence.
   Food and dairy group Unigate rose 7 pence to 312 pence,
after reporting a 5% rise for fiscal 1990 to #105.5 million,
exceeding market forecasts.
   Hambros, a banking and financial services concern,
increased 3 pence to 286 pence, after it reported a 10%
increase in pretax profit for the fiscal year.
   STC, a computers and electronics company, fell 19 pence to
239 pence, after issuing a half-year warning that profit
won't match market expectations.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Madrid; mixed in Paris, Brussels and Zurich,
and lower in Milan. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, shares closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Hong
Kong, and Manila, were mixed in Singapore, and lower in Seoul
and Taipei.
