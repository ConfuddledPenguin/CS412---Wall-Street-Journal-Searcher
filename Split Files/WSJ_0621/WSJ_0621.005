   OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose an
inflation-adjusted 0.5% in the first quarter, led by new
housing construction and consumer spending on durable goods,
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The growth was stronger than many economic analysts had
predicted. It followed a 0.6% increase in GDP for the 1989
fourth quarter. GDP is the total value of a country's output
of goods and services.

   Inflation-adjusted consumer spending on durable goods
increased 1.5% in the first quarter, and residential
construction activity rose 0.9%. Durable goods are products
such as household furnishings that are considered useful for
at least three years. Business investment in machinery and
equipment was unchanged in the first quarter, after rising
3.3% in the preceding quarter.
   The GDP implicit price index, a broad measure of inflation
trends, rose 0.7% in the first quarter, the same rate as in
the fourth quarter.
   Separately, Statistics Canada reported that manufacturers'
unfilled orders declined in April for the sixth consecutive
month, dropping 1.1% from March. Manufacturers of
transportation equipment and electrical and electronic
products accounted for most of the order backlog decline.
   Manufacturers' shipments declined 0.7% in April, following
two consecutive monthly increases.
   In another report, the agency said Canada's deficit on the
current account of its international balance of payments
widened in the first quarter to 5.08 billion Canadian dollars
(US$4.33 billion) from C$4.66 billion in the 1989 fourth
quarter. The deterioration was blamed mainly on the Canadian
government's decision to forgive debt owed to Canada by some
poor countries. The current account is a financial accounting
of a country's trade in goods and services; it also includes
investment income flows and various other financial
activities, such as transfers of immigrants' funds.
