   Forget the vote on the flag amendment for a moment. Today
the Senate is scheduled to vote on something that could do a
lot more to define the future political character of the
United States. It's the old Hatch Act. President Bush has
already vetoed a bill to repeal the act's prohibitions on
political activity by federal employees. The House overrode
the veto yesterday, by a whopping and revealing 327 to 93
vote. The vote in the Senate today is expected to be closer.
The outcome will tell the public much about whose interests
the modern Congress represents these days.
   The bill that Mr. Bush vetoed would let some three million
federal and postal workers hold party offices and solicit
money from co-workers for federal workers' PACs.

   This, of course, is taking place at the very moment that
Congress is in a budget summit with the White House to get
control of the Titanic $1.2 trillion federal budget. That
budget pays for what all these three million federal workers
do. Is Congress serious? Probably not very about controlling
the budget, but we suspect the Members, particularly the
Democrats, are quite serious about transforming public
workers into voting constituents. Term limitations, anyone?
   But there is also a philosophical relationship between the
out-of-control federal budget and this effort to repeal the
Hatch Act. In political capitals around the world today --
Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, Mexico City, London, Brasilia,
Washington, Albany, Trenton -- the issue on the table is the
public sector's claim on incomes. In every case there is at
least recognition now that the public commitment -- and
usually what we're talking about here is the size of the
public workforce -- is too large and too expensive. Public
budgets everywhere are cracking under this weight.
   What is by no means settled is whether the politicians who
are elected to represent private citizens have the will to
gain control over this public colossus. President Salinas of
Mexico has shown extraordinary political courage to date in
trying to wean his country off dependency on public
institutions and publicly subsidized jobs. But the House of
Representatives by its vote yesterday on Mr. Bush's Hatch
veto makes plain what many voters suspect: It does not have
the will to control public-sector growth. Its Members'
incumbency, which is to say their careers, is now dependent
on the power that such a large legislative and bureaucratic
state confers.
   Obviously there is a partisan interest in overturning the
Hatch Act. Public employees' unions have become the most
vibrant source of political support for Democratic
presidential candidates in the wake of the effort by the
teachers' unions to help elect Jimmy Carter. Beneath this
lies the continuing Democratic assumption that most problems
-- the homeless, the environment, welfare dependency, failed
schools, health costs -- will be righted merely with a larger
public commitment, which is to say by hiring more public
workers to lay their hands on the problems in perpetuity. The
Democrats now want federal employees to be able to lobby for
more of this.
   The vote in the Senate today will reveal whether Congress
wishes to send the U.S. further into this public-sector dream
world or get on with the business of scaling back the state
and its unsupportable costs.
