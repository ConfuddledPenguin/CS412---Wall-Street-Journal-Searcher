   Over-the-counter stocks managed to close slightly higher,
but many traders awaited news of next week's sale of two-year
and four-year Treasury notes.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.27 to 460.80, a 0.06%
gain, on 148.1 million shares, up from 143 million shares
Tuesday. Advancing stocks barely outpaced declining shares,
967 to 931.

   After opening higher, the OTC market fell prey to
profit-taking; the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.87 in
intraday trading before recovering. "There was some
apprehension about the Treasury's plans" for the notes sale,
said Peter Coolidge, senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody. He
added the late-day recovery reflected optimism that the
Treasury sales wouldn't push interest rates up.
   But Mr. Coolidge said that uncertainty about economic data
due for release later this week could encourage other
investors to the sidelines. "To get a sustained rally in this
choppy market is very difficult," he said, adding that
investors remain uncertain about whether the market has
peaked.
   Two stocks gave up their gains from Tuesday. MCI
Communications eased 7/8 to 41 5/8 on more than 1.9 million
shares, pressuring the Nasdaq Utility Index down 3.72 to
655.14. Shares of the Washington, D.C., long-distance carrier
closed up 5/8 Tuesday amid expectations of a positive
announcement yesterday, traders said. The company unveiled a
new long-distance service aimed at small- to mid-sized
companies.
   Also active was Newport Pharmaceuticals, which fell 5/8 to
3 on 780,200 shares. Tuesday, the stock gained 13/16 after
reports that Scandinavian tests of its controversial drug,
isoprinosine, indicated the drug may delay the onset of AIDS
in people infected with the HIV virus. However, Food and Drug
Administration officials cautioned that the studies ran
counter to other tests of the drug and said the results must
be viewed cautiously.
   Nike leaped 2 5/8 to 77 5/8 after the Beaverton, Ore.,
athletic footwear maker declared a 2-for-1 stock split late
Tuesday. The company also said its board will ask
shareholders at the Sept. 17 annual meeting to approve a
threefold increase in the authorized shares of both the Class
A and Class B common stock. Nike also said it plans to apply
for listing of its Class B common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange after completion of the stock split.
   Marquest Medical Products jumped 1 1/2 to 9 after the
Englewood, Colo., maker of disposable medical products
reported operating profit for the fourth quarter ended March
31 of $994,000, up from $22,000 a year earlier.
   Pacific Nuclear Systems advanced 1/2 to 5 7/8 after the
Federal Way, Wash., provider of nuclear waste disposal
services said a unit of the company and a West German company
were awarded a contract to clean two steam generators for
Korea Electric Power Corp.
   Werner Enterprises added 3/4 to 18 1/2. Tuesday, the
Omaha, Neb., motor carrier declared a regular
three-cent-a-share dividend payable July 23.
   Rumors fueled a 7 3/8-point surge in the American
depositary receipts of LM Ericsson Telephone, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Traders cited rumors
the Swedish communications equipment company will win a large
contract to supply cellular telephone equipment for the
metropolitan New York City area. However, a spokeswoman told
Professional Investor Report that the company had no
announcements, adding that she doesn't see anything
"absolutely tremendous in the foreseeable future." The ADRs
closed at a high of 224 1/8.
   Rebounding from a 1/4 drop Tuesday,
   CoreStates Financial rose 1/2 to 41 as analysts disagreed
about the effect of the Philadelphia bank's recent
acquisition of First Pennsylvania Corp., according to
Professional Investor Report. Yesterday, Merrill Lynch
analyst Livia Asher said she thinks cost savings from the
acquisition could be better than expected and could help
produce strong results in the second half.
   However, Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Richard Lawrence
on Tuesday lowered his opinion on the stock to a "sell" from
a "buy." The analyst cited concerns about the potential for
further real estate loan deterioration, especially from the
First Pennsylvania purchase, Professional Investor Report
said.
   Repligen traded more than 25 times average volume. The
Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology and health-care concern
issued two million common shares priced at $15.50 each.
Repligen fell 3/4 to 15 on 837,000 shares.
   Two financial issues tumbled as the weak Northeastern real
estate market continued to plague some banks and thrifts in
that region.
   Eastland Financial slid 5/8 to 3 after the Woonsocket,
R.I., thrift and banking holding company said that additions
to its loan-loss reserves will result in a pretax charge of
$19 million and a loss for the second quarter. The company's
management said it will recommend suspending its
10-cent-a-share dividend in the second quarter until
"appropriate levels of profitability" are restored. Eastland
Financial had net income of 22 cents a share in the second
quarter a year earlier.
   Affiliated Banc eased 1/8 to 2 1/4 after the Holyoke,
Mass., thrift said it will suspend its eight-cent-a-share
quarterly dividend indefinitely and expects to report a loss
of $3.5 million for the second quarter ending in June.
   Showbiz Pizza Time tumbled 3 1/2 to 22 1/4 after officials
of the Irving, Texas, family restaurant concern told analysts
the company expects same-store sales to be flat for the
second quarter, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Frank
told Professional Investor Report the company now expects to
earn about 33 cents a share, up from 21 cents a share a year
earlier, which included an eight-cent tax credit. Eppler,
Guerin &amp; Turner analyst Dennis Telzrow slashed his quarterly
earnings estimate for Showbiz Pizza Time to 32 cents a share
from 42 cents a share after the presentation, Professional
Investor Report said.
   Cross &amp; Trecker fell 1/4 to 8 3/4. Tuesday, the Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker said it sold its Alliance
Automation unit in Rochester, N.Y., to closely held Ambac
International Ltd. of Dallas. Terms weren't disclosed. The
stock fell 1/4 Tuesday.
