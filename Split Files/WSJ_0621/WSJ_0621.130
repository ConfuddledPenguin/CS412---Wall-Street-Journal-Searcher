   Ethyl S.A., the European unit of Ethyl Corp., said it
plans to locate a research and development facility at the
Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, about 19 miles
southeast of Brussels.
   Ethyl S.A. said its initial investment in the facility
will be about $8 million for 20 acres of land -- with an
option to buy five more acres -- initial construction and
equipment. The company said construction will begin in
mid-1991 and the first phase is expected to be completed in
early 1993.

   In addition to research and development, the facility will
market and sell Ethyl S.A.'s industrial chemicals, petroleum
additives, and other specialty chemicals, many of which are
manufactured in its Feluy, Belgium, complex.
   Ethyl Corp., Richmond, Va., also has an R&amp;D facility in
England, which serves Europe and the Middle East.
