   UAL Corp.'s unions are seeking to persuade Boeing Co. and
General Electric Co. to invest in the labor group's proposed
$4.38 billion buy-out of United Airlines.
   Boeing and GE declined to comment on the talks, which
union officials described as "very preliminary." But a strong
incentive to such an arrangement, which would reduce the
unions' dependence on bank financing, apparently would be to
make Boeing and GE the leading candidates for a pending
aircraft and jet-engine order that is expected to total about
four times the value of the buy-out.

   The labor group, which has an Aug. 9 deadline to finance
their offer, is said to be seeking either a cash or debt
investment from Boeing and GE.
   In return, Boeing and GE would receive either preferred
stock or a note in UAL, but no common stock, since the unions
want to keep the company 100% employee-owned. The unions also
discussed giving Boeing and GE preferred-supplier status,
people familiar with the talks said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UAL fell 25 cents a share to $156, well below the $201 a
share buy-out price.
   It couldn't be determined if Seattle-based Boeing, the
nation's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, or GE,
the Fairfield, Conn., maker of electronic products and jet
engines, would be interested in joining the buy-out effort.
It was also unclear how much of a say in UAL the unions would
give those companies if they agreed to join the buy-out.
   An investment from either Boeing or GE would reduce the
buy-out group's dependence on bank financing at a time when
lenders are reluctant to finance takeovers. Banks have been
particularly cool toward the UAL proposal, citing concerns
about how the employee-owned company would be governed.
   An agreement with Boeing or GE could give the unions
considerable added leverage in dealing with banks. Any
financing that GE or Boeing might provide, would be
subordinate to the banks' contribution, therefore cushioning
commercial lenders in the event of a default, officials close
to the talks said.
   United has longstanding relationships with both companies.
Boeing is currently in a heated battle to land an aircraft
order from United that is expected to total more than $15
billion, possibly the largest ever placed. GE is in the
running to provide the engines for one of the aircraft types
United is considering, the Boeing 777, a version of a jet
United already operates.
   The unions may try to seek as much as $1 billion in
financing from GE and Boeing. General Electric Capital, a GE
subsidiary, provides loans for buy-outs.
   The labor group is said to be seeking between $2.5 billion
and $3 billion from banks. Gerald Greenwald, the former
Chrysler Corp. vice chairman who is heading the employee
buy-out effort, has held talks over the last two weeks with
as many as eight banks. Banks received copies of the unions'
business plan last week. But the buy-out group has yet to
enter into formal negotiations with any lender.
   At these meetings, bank representatives sought assurances
that the unions won't block asset sales to pay down debt.
Although the majority of UAL's board, as envisioned, would
consist of outside directors, the unions' board
representatives could block any asset sales.
   Banks also have indicated they would feel more comfortable
if the buy-out had the backing of an outside equity investor.
The unions are proving "sweat equity" in the form of $2
billion of wage concessions.
   It was unclear whether Boeing or GE's participation in the
buy-out would pose any antitrust questions, particularly if
they were to receive preferred-supplier status.
   There is precedent for Boeing's involvement. Three years
ago, the company entered into an unusual financing agreement
with United that would have permitted it to take a 16% stake
in the airline. Ironically, Boeing had agreed to the move in
an effort to help UAL's management at the time ward off a
takeover proposal from United's pilot union.
