   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted foreign trade
account for May showed a deficit of 5.68 billion francs
($1.01 billion) on a preliminary basis, after a revised April
deficit of 4.38 billion francs, which was initially estimated
at 4.31 billion francs, the National Customs Office said.
   The latest result was significantly worse than earlier
forecasts by Paris market economists, who generally expected
a deficit of 2.5 billion to three billion francs; the most
pessimistic estimate had been for a gap of as much as 4.5
billion francs.

   Unadjusted results for May showed a deficit of 8.32
billion francs, after a revised April deficit of 3.09 billion
francs and a May 1989 deficit of 9.17 billion francs. The
unadjusted April 1990 deficit previously was estimated at
3.03 billion francs.
   The latest results brought France's adjusted trade deficit
for the first five months of this year to 12.49 billion
francs, a slight narrowing from the year-earlier deficit of
14.38 billion francs. This cumulative deficit was 19.68
billion francs on an unadjusted basis, compared with 22.49
billion francs a year earlier.
