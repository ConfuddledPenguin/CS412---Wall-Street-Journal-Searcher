   A federal judge this week sentenced the former president
of a defunct unit of Enron Corp. to one year and one day in
jail for his part in an oil trading scam that cost the
company more than $140 million.
   Louis Borget pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and income
tax violations stemming from accusations that he and other
officials of the Enron Oil Corp. unit created sham trades and
falsified documents for personal financial gain. The sentence
was imposed by Judge Gerard Goettel in the federal court in
White Plains, N.Y.

   Enron declined comment on the matter, citing pending civil
litigation against Mr. Borget. Enron Oil, an international
oil trading unit, was discontinued in 1987.
   In addition to the jail sentence, Mr. Borget received five
years of probation and was ordered to pay $5.9 million
restitution. He has 30 days to surrender.
