   NEW YORK -- Precious metals futures prices recovered from
sharp early declines to end with moderate gains.
   August delivery gold finished up $1.30 an ounce at
$353.10, after trading as low as $349.50. July silver
rebounded from a drop to $4.7650 to close at $4.842, for a
net gain of 1.5 cents an ounce. Platinum, which is the most
thinly traded precious metal and is most sensitive to price
movements, ended with the best gain. The July contract rose
$5.90 an ounce to $482.10 after first dropping to $473.

   "A strong dollar and weaker oil prices contributed to
early declines in precious metals," said Craig Sloane,
precious metals analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
New York.
   Silver was the weakest market on the way down, and the
July contract came close to testing its life-of-contract low
of $4.7620.
   "However, good demand came in later and helped precious
metals as a whole to recover," Mr. Sloane said.
   Rumors that South African gold mining companies may close
some mines because of the current low price of the metal and
news service reports that South African gold miners have
called for a strike on July 2, also contributed to the rally,
said Ian MacDonald, vice president, Credit Suisse, New York.
   "There has been concern over whether or not some mines
could continue operating with the present low prices," Mr.
MacDonald said. "If that's the case, where will the needed
gold come from?"
   There was good demand for gold bullion from the Far East
and the Middle East, Mr. MacDonald said. "Basically, it looks
like the market is trying to bottom out."
   Don Mackay-Coghill, chief executive officer of Goldcorp
Australia, the holding company of the Perth Mint in Perth,
Australia, observed that the "feeling in many quarters is
that the buying was by the same Saudi Arabian interests that
have been recent strong sellers."
   "Gold is grasping for a bottom as the selling is becoming
exhausted," said James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge
Financial Management of Cambridge, Mass. "Evidence is that
gold recovered while the dollar was still strong and despite
oil's weakness, two traditional depressants on gold."
   Added Ken Gettinger, vice president, precious metals, for
Union Bank of Switzerland, New York branch, "It was a very
encouraging market, with the heaviest volume we have seen in
months."
   Technically, gold and silver had been heavily oversold,
and strong demand developed when they held at the lows of the
day, Mr. Gettinger said. "Buying was helped by reports of
labor problems in South Africa. Most significantly, there was
heavy selling while the rally was in progress, but it was
well-absorbed by the buying."

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices traded over a wide range and
ended mostly lower. Only the July contract finished higher,
rising 7.30 cents a pound to $1.74. September finished with a
loss of 3.40 cents at $1.6870, and other deferred months were
also lower. The final prices yesterday created a premium for
the July contract over September, a reversal of the previous
day, when July was at a discount to September. One analyst
said that change could reflect concern over obtaining
supplies of the concentrate for immediate delivery. Prices
fluctuated widely during the day. The July contract rose its
daily limit of 10 cents a pound before selling trimmed the
advance. September rose and fell sharply, trading as low as
$1.6410, a limit eight-cent decline, and as high as $1.7990,
a range of 15.80 cents. Trading was very choppy, said William
Adams, analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in Orlando, Fla. "We had
100-point moves from trade to trade at times," he said. A
point is one-hundredth of a cent. Contributing to the
independent strength in the July delivery, Mr. Adams said,
was buying back of contracts by previous short sellers who
wanted to get out of their positions because the first day on
which delivery notices will be issued, July 2, is
approaching.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: A morning rally in grain prices ran
out of steam when forecasters began predicting a respite from
the unusually heavy rains that have slowed planting and
damaged crops. Soybean prices soared early in the trading
session amid reports of widespread flooding in Iowa. But near
the close of trading, some private meteorologists erased rain
from their forecasts. After the close of trading, the
National Weather Service's six-to-10-day forecast called for
below-normal chances of rain in the Midwest. Dry weather
would erode grain prices by improving growing conditions of
many wet fields, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Prices of
soybean futures contracts finished moderately higher, while
prices of most corn futures contracts settled slightly lower.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell on a possible large buildup in
supplies. July delivery copper declined 3.15 cents a pound to
$1.0985. Analysts said fresh selling developed after Reuter
reported that London Metal Exchange inventories of copper
were expected to rise 30,000 tons over the next three weeks.
The exchange issues reports on its copper inventories on
Tuesdays and Fridays. According to one analyst, traders
believe exchange supplies will increase, but not that
quickly. However, the report triggered selling that depressed
prices, he said.
