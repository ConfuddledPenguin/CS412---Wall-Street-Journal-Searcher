   WASHINGTON -- The White House put forward a new proposal
to shrink the fiscal 1991 budget deficit by about $50.5
billion, but Democrats immediately began sniping at the plan
and said it wasn't sufficient to move the budget summit
forward.
   Although House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.)
emerged from the closed-door talks saying that "today
succeeded in starting serious negotiations," other Democrats
were far gloomier.

   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.)
called the Bush administration's proposal "a new suit on that
old corpse," while Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen (D., Texas) termed it "a very inadequate reply." And
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.),
among the Democrats most eager to find a deficit-reduction
compromise, said, "It's a start, but it makes for a very
difficult start."
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who won't
provide a written version of the proposal until today,
clearly hoped it would break the logjam that has paralyzed
the budget summit since it began in mid-May. His hopes don't
appear to have been realized. After listening to Mr. Darman's
plan yesterday, one Democrat told him, "It's so inadequate
you couldn't even respond to it," a participant at the talks
said.
   After Democratic negotiators caucused, Sen. Sasser said
there was a "general recognition that it would be almost
impossible to use as a negotiating document."
   The new $50.5 billion deficit-reduction plan builds on
proposals in President Bush's January budget that, by the
administration's new figuring, would have reduced the fiscal
1991 projected deficit by $40.5 billion, congressional
sources said. It calls for no new revenues or user fees
beyond the $20 billion outlined in the January budget.
   The plan would cut projected spending on entitlement
programs, such as the Medicare health-care program for the
elderly, by about $17 billion, compared with $14 billion in
the January budget. Mr. Darman listed a host of new
money-saving changes to entitlement programs, such as forcing
drug companies to cut prices paid by Medicaid, the
health-care program for the poor, and further trimming
federal employee health benefits.
   The administration also cut projected defense spending by
$5.9 billion, compared with a $2.3 billion cut proposed in
January. And it would cut so-called domestic discretionary
spending, programs for which Congress appropriates money
annually, by about $4 billion, compared with the $500 million
in savings outlined in January.
   "It is the beginning," Rep. Gephardt said. "We have a
long, long way to go."
   New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, the senior Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, said the proposal by Mr. Darman
would reduce the deficit by $440 billion to $444 billion over
the next five years. "It is a good starting point and will
permit us to proceed with serious negotiations," he said.
Democrats predicted that the Congressional Budget Office will
estimate the savings to be much less.
   The new plan came as the congressional and White House
budget offices increased their estimates of the budget
deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Mr. Darman's
new numbers indicate that if the budget summit fails,
across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law could be as large as $95 billion this
fall -- even if Congress agrees to exclude spending on the
savings-and-loan bailout.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget surprised
congressional summit participants by saying it now puts the
1991 deficit at $158 billion, $20 billion more than the $138
billion estimated just a month ago and far larger than the
January forecast of $100.5 billion. The Congressional Budget
Office said the red ink will swell to $162 billion, compared
with the $131 billion it estimated in March.
   These latest numbers don't include the cost of paying for
the S&amp;L bailout. If the S&amp;L costs are counted, the OMB said
the fiscal 1991 deficit would total between $200 billion and
$222 billion, while the CBO put the deficit at $232 billion.
   "The point is the problem is getting worse," Sen. Sasser
said.
