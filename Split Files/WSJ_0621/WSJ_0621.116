   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded about
$670 million of General Dynamics Corp. debt, citing a
slowdown in military spending and potentially major cost
overruns on a Navy aircraft contract.
   The downgrades are part of a continuing appraisal of
aerospace and defense contractors by Moody's. "The prospects
for cuts in the defense budget have triggered our concern for
the industry as a whole and this company in particular," said
Tassos Philipakkos, Moody vice president and aerospace
analyst.

   Moody's said it downgraded General Dynamics' senior debt
to Baa-1 from A-2. The company's subordinated debt was
lowered to Baa-2 from A-3, and its commercial paper was cut
to Prime-2 from Prime-1. Ratings on the company's General
Dynamics Credit Corp. unit also were lowered by like amounts.
   Moody's announcement was made shortly before the end of
trading. General Dynamics stock closed at $34.50, off 62.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The reductions for senior and subordinated debt are by two
notches, a sharper cut than the one-notch reductions that
Moody's made recently on McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Grumman
Corp. securities. General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas are
based in St. Louis. Grumman is based in Bethpage, N.Y. Mr.
Philipakkos said that both of General Dynamics' competitors
had been more recently downgraded, while General Dynamics had
remained at its peak rating.
   Moody's said General Dynamics is heavily dependent on
military contracts, citing particularly expected production
cuts for the Army's M-1 tank and the Air Force's F-16
fighter.
