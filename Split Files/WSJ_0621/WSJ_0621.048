   OTTAWA -- The Manitoba and Newfoundland governments
introduced in their respective legislatures bills to ratify
the proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord, but prospects
for passage of the bills appeared doubtful.
   The Meech Lake accord, negotiated three years ago, is a
package of constitutional amendments designed to meet the
constitutional concerns of Quebec and to defuse the
independence forces in the largely French-speaking province.
The accord would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society"
within Canada.

   Manitoba and Newfoundland are the only provinces that
haven't yet ratified the accord. If the agreement doesn't get
their approval by Saturday, it will lapse.
   The Manitoba government's efforts to get the ratification
bill before its legislature were delayed for a week by a
filibuster by the legislature's only aboriginal member,
Elijah Harper. Most Canadian aboriginal groups oppose the
amendments because they say they don't address their concerns
over native rights.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he will address the
Newfoundland legislature today in an effort to win support
for the Meech Lake accord. Many Newfoundland legislators have
expressed opposition to the agreement.
