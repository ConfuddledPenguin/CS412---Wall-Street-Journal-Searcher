   WASHINGTON -- A federal grand jury indicted a husband and
wife, both former officers of Republic Bank for Savings of
Jackson, Miss., on charges of falsifying bank reports and
other charges.
   The grand jury in Jackson charged Philip Shunk and Linda
Shunk with conspiring to misapply the bank's funds, with
three counts of making false bank entries, and with one count
of converting one share of Country Club of Jackson stock held
by the bank to their own use. Mr. Strunk was charged with
seven additional counts of making false entries in bank
reports.

   If convicted of all charges, Mr. Shunk faces a maximum
penalty of 65 years in prison and a $3 million fine. Mrs.
Shunk faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million
fine.
   Mr. Shunk was president of the federally chartered thrift
from October 1985 until December 1987, when he resigned. He
was succeeded by his wife, who had been executive vice
president. She remained president until she was removed by
federal regulators when they took control of Republic in July
1988.
   News of the indictment came as the House overwhelmingly
approved $75 million in fiscal 1991 appropriations for
Justice Department prosecutions and civil proceedings related
to financial institutions. That represents more than a 50%
increase above the current spending. The money was added to a
pending bill that would provide $10.5 billion for the
Justice, State, and Commerce Departments for the new budget
year, which begins Oct. 1.
   Separately, the Justice Department said that the 93 U.S.
attorneys have been called to Washington for a meeting
tomorrow with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh concerning
prosecution of savings and loan fraud cases. The department
said President Bush will speak to the prosecutors.
   Yesterday, a private government watchdog group accused the
Bush administration of tardy and weak prosecution of S&amp;L
fraud. Federal prosecutions have recouped less than 1% of
taxpayers' losses that are attributable to fraud, collecting
less than $100 million in restitution and fines, according to
Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader-backed group.
   "Our study leads to an inescapable, disturbing conclusion:
The Bush administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L
fraud have been anemic at best," said Sherry Ettleson of
Public Citizen.
   Such comments, and the lopsided 420-1 House vote to
increase government funds for cracking down on financial
wrongdoers, reflect the increasing political volatility of
the S&amp;L issue. But President Bush, speaking at a news
conference during a speaking trip to Alabama, declined to
repeat this week's White House assertions that Democrats are
to blame for much of the S&amp;L mess and subsequent bailout. Mr.
Bush said he doesn't want to "be out there saying here's
who's to blame and here's who's not to blame."
   Mr. Bush, sounding a theme his administration intends to
repeat more and more to deflect its handling of the crisis,
promised "plenty more" prosecutions of thrift officials who
violated laws. Mr. Bush said he met with Mr. Thornburgh this
week to discuss the cases being brought and said his
administration will "put those that are guilty into the dock
where they belong and see that they are brought to
responsibility for what they've done."
