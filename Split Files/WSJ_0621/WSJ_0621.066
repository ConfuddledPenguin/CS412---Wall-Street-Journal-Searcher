   A gurgling and clicking noise fills Jean Thornton's
Waterboro, Maine, home and chases her like a ghost. There is
no escape from this haunting sound; it comes from deep within
her own chest.
   Implanted in her heart are two mechanical valves made by
Pfizer Inc., and not a day goes by without her imagining that
they have failed and death is near. Often, her husband drops
what he's doing and gets a stethoscope to listen. "We don't
know from one minute to the next" if the device is working
properly, Charles Thornton says.

   The Thorntons have reason to worry. Eight years ago, their
30-year-old son joined, at last count, at least 260 other
people who have died when their Pfizer-made heart valves
fractured. John Thornton spent his last day building a tree
house for his two small children. But by midnight, in the
back of a speeding ambulance, ashen and gasping for air, he
let go of his father's hand. "I knew he was gone," Mr.
Thornton says.
   Alleged design and manufacturing flaws have made the
Pfizer valve -- known as the Bjork-Shiley Convexo-Concave --
one of the worst medical-device disasters ever. (By
comparison with other heart valves currently in use, the next
most severe case of known structural failure is believed to
have accounted for fewer than 10 deaths.) A total of 86,000
were implanted in people in the U.S. and abroad since the
Food and Drug Administration approved the valve for sale in
1979. It was recalled in 1986.
   The problem has caused untold suffering among people who
wonder whether their valves will operate for another 10
seconds or another 10 years. And though Pfizer defends its
overall handling of the situation, some of its actions have
heightened the emotional fallout to patients and their
families. Among other things, the New York-based
pharmaceutical giant was ill-equipped to issue warnings; by
its own admission, it knows the names of only half the people
equipped with the device.
   The increased patient anxiety has left the company facing
a potentially costly variety of lawsuits, brought by patients
with functioning Bjork-Shiley valves who claim its potential
for failure has caused them emotional distress. Such suits
have been filed on behalf of scores of patients. On May 4, in
one such case, the California Supreme Court refused to
consider Pfizer's objections to this kind of lawsuit, meaning
that the case can go to trial in state court there.
   As word about the heart-valve problem began spreading in
news reports, concerned callers nearly overwhelmed Shiley
Inc., the Pfizer unit that made the valve. When Anne
Cunningham of Las Vegas, Nev., gave Pfizer the serial number
of her 19-year-old son's valve, she says she was told that
valve was in somebody in Spain.
   "The heart-valve problem was paralyzing the company," says
Roger M. Sachs, Pfizer's top expert on the matter.
   Nearly all the 20 heart-valve patients interviewed for
this article learned that their valves could fail, not from
Pfizer or their doctors, but from TV shows or newspaper
articles that disclosed allegations from former Pfizer
employees of shoddy manufacturing work.
   The valve's weakness has thrust into the lives of many
people frightening and persistent thoughts of their own
mortality. The cruel fact: Open-heart surgery to replace the
valve is considered riskier than leaving it in and living
with the odds that it could fail. The company estimates,
based on past valve failures, that each year the chances of a
patient's valve failing range from 0.021% to 1.1%, depending
on the valve's size and date of manufacture.
   Jack Okun, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel from Sherman
Oaks, Calif., had a valve implanted in 1984 but only learned
of its potential for failure last year. "I am now aware of
practically every heartbeat in my chest and worry if . . .
the valve is or could be failing," Mr. Okun wrote to Rep.
John Dingell, (D., Mich.) whose subcommittee on oversight and
investigations has criticized Pfizer's actions.
   The 69-year-old former fighter pilot says he and his wife
refrain from sex, and he shuns other physical activity. "I
now avoid any debates, arguments, crowded facilities or large
family and professional gatherings as I don't feel that I am
emotionally capable of handling these situations. I have
become very introspective and somewhat bitter."
   The same predicament has Kathleen Langlitz, a 59-year old
legal secretary from New Rochelle, N.Y., questioning her own
mental stability. "I get so concerned in the middle of the
night. I find myself moaning," Mrs. Langlitz says, beginning
to cry, "and I realize I'm doing it to hear my own voice, to
make sure I'm alive. I come downstairs and get the
stethoscope to listen to it."
   Mechanical heart valves are about as old as manned space
flight, and have saved or improved the lives of hundreds of
thousands. Many people report an almost giddy feeling of
freedom after a valve implant cures their constant fatigue,
periodic bouts with congestive heart failure and other
ailments. The steady clicking can be reassuring. A flawed
valve, however, can be deadly -- two-thirds of Bjork-Shiley
fractures have resulted in death.
   Pfizer says about 500 of the very highest-risk valves were
sold -- all outside the U.S. Valves sold in the U.S. have, at
worst, a 0.295% annual failure rate, Pfizer estimates.
Pfizer's figures, however, could be much lower than the
actual number of deaths. The symptoms of valve failure aren't
much different from some other kinds of severe cardiac
distress. And unless someone suspects a valve problem, it's
unlikely an autopsy would be done to examine the valve.
   Pfizer routinely pays settlements -- it won't discuss the
terms -- to families of patients who die from valve fractures
and to patients who survive fractures. But Pfizer says it
won't settle anxiety claims. At issue are not only charges of
poor design and manufacturing, but allegations that Pfizer
was tardy in notifying the FDA and doctors of valve
fractures.
   Dr. Sachs denies all of these charges and asserts that
"the patients who have these valves are not at a greater
overall risk than they thought they were." While the
Bjork-Shiley is more prone to fracture than other valves, he
says it is less likely than other valves to induce
life-threatening blood clots. The valves originally sold for
about $2,000 each, and there are about 55,000 people still
living with implants.
   Pfizer isn't trying to contact patients directly. Instead,
the company says it relies on doctors to tell their patients
about the possibility of fracture, its symptoms and what to
do. On March 30, it sent out 273,800 copies of a letter with
such information to doctors and emergency medical workers in
the U.S., up from a mailing to just 5,000 cardiologists in
August 1989.
   It seems likely, however, that thousands of patients with
the valve still don't know of its potential for failure, and
therefore wouldn't know what lifesaving steps to take if
their valve did fracture.
   Fred Barbee says his wife died because of such ignorance.
When Carol Barbee collapsed in April 1988, Mr. Barbee drove
her to the emergency room nearest their Minong, Wis., home --
directly south in Spooner. But open-heart surgery couldn't be
performed there, and after a delay she had to be taken back
north to Duluth, Minn., where she died.
   "Her {brain} was dead by the time she got here," says Per
Wickstrom, Mrs. Barbee's Duluth surgeon. He can't say for
sure whether she would have survived the valve fracture had
she come straight to Duluth. "But it would have been nice to
operate on her earlier."
   Aside from worrying, what can be done? Kenneth Merz, a
former TRW Inc. research scientist with two Pfizer valves in
his heart, has tried to channel his concern into a useful
pursuit -- figuring out how to detect whether and when
they'll fail.
   The Bjork-Shiley valve is a ring sewn into the heart, with
a disk inside that opens and closes about 40 million times a
year to let blood flow. Two metal struts control the disk. It
is believed that, in failing, first one side of the smaller
strut breaks and the valve continues working for some time
until the additional stress on the remaining side of the
strut breaks it as well, and the disk breaks free.
   Mr. Merz reasons that a properly functioning valve makes a
distinct and constant sound that can be recorded. If
researchers could figure out the approximate time between the
first side of a strut breaking and the second one, they could
do regular acoustic tests on Bjork-Shiley patients. When the
sound changes, indicating one side is broken, there would be
time to perform valve-replacement surgery before the second
side breaks.
   Mr. Merz says he asked Pfizer for its research data but
hasn't gotten any yet. "They're stonewalling." He has no
plans to sue over anxiety. "I'd rather sue to force them to
do something -- to get {them to} design a test that detects
failure."
   Dr. Sachs says Mr. Merz's proposed approach is precisely
one of the detection avenues Pfizer is looking into. By later
this year, he says, the company expects to know if it's
feasible, though actually putting together testing equipment
would take more time. The company will share its data with
anyone who has a reasonable and well-designed research
proposal, Dr Sachs says. "The worry is that {a poorly
designed test} will stampede patients into risky and needless
surgery."
   Marie Johnson had a premonition after seeing a Jan. 1,
1987, segment about the valve on ABC's "20/20" show. The next
year, she needed surgery to replace a separate pigskin valve,
and she says she asked her doctor to remove her Bjork-Shiley
since her chest was going to be open. He declined, she says,
telling her it would prolong an already risky operation.
   Seven months later, on the morning of March 1, 1989, she
was watching television, "trying to decide whether to go
upstairs and take a shower and set my hair, or whether to
clean the house first. All of a sudden . . . I can only tell
you what I didn't feel. I felt no pain. Not dizzy. Not hot. I
could still think. All I know was something was going on in
my body that was different. I felt my chest. My heart was
still beating."
   "I knew I'd better call my doctor or I was going to die,"
she says. An ambulance took her the 3.3 miles to Parkview
Memorial Hospital's regional trauma and heart center in Fort
Wayne, Ind. After a series of tests and X-rays, she underwent
open-heart surgery to replace a fractured Bjork-Shiley
Convexo-Concave valve. The disk itself shot down her aorta
and was recovered from her groin area, and a broken strut was
later removed from her arm.
   Mrs. Johnson is now 60, but she looks older and a little
confused, a rare survivor of an aortic-valve failure. She has
had three recent bouts with congestive heart failure, and
says she tires too easily to enjoy spending the settlement
she received from Shiley. "My powers of concentration are
shot. I have to read the same sentence several times to
understand what I read. Then," she says in the darkness of
her living room, "I forget anyway." The grandchildren she
used to baby-sit still drop by, but "they get on my nerves
now. I can't stand to have them around."
