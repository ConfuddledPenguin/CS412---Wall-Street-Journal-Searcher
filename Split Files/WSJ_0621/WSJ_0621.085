   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
use of the drug levamisole for certain colon cancer patients.
   The drug is manufactured by Janssen Research Foundation, a
unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J. It is already
on the market for use in removing parasitic worms from cows,
pigs, and other farm animals. It is also an approved
anti-worming drug for humans in the U.S., but the chief
market for that use is the Third World, according to a
Janssen spokesman.

   Under the new FDA approval, levamisole will be used in
combination with a generic drug, fluorouracil, to treat colon
cancer patients who have undergone surgery and whose cancer
has spread to lymph nodes. The FDA estimates this group to
number 21,000 in the U.S.
   Levamisole's effectiveness in treating colon cancer
patients was demonstrated in trials conducted by the federal
government's National Cancer Institute. The results were
published earlier this year in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
