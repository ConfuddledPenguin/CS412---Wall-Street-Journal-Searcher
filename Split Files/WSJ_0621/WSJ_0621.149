   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. reported sharply wider losses for
fiscal 1990, mainly because of heavy financing costs and
write-downs related to its U.S. retailing operations, which
have sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Campeau had a net loss in the year ended Jan. 31 of $1.74
billion, or $39.59 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss
of $34 million, or $1.04 a share. The latest period includes
a loss of $104 million, or $2.34 a share, from discontinued
real-estate operations. There wasn't a similar charge in the
previous year.

   Campeau's U.S. retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., filed for Chapter 11
protection on Jan. 15.
   Campeau said it took non-cash charges in the latest year
of $1.63 billion. These included the write-down of $958
million of good will in Federated, $371 million in
depreciation and amortization, and $259 million from the
write-down of financing costs of mainly high-yield debt of
the companies now in Chapter 11.
   "It's very difficult to ascertain anything significant
from these numbers," said Harry Rannala, an analyst at McLean
McCarthy Ltd. in Toronto. He said Campeau's corporate health
depends more on its ability to restructure its debt than it
does on its operating performance.
   Campeau's consolidated revenue rose about 20% to $10.44
billion from $8.67 billion. The largest revenue gain came at
Ralphs Grocery Co., which posted a 39% sales rise to $2.56
billion. The Federated and Allied retailing units had
combined sales of $7.57 billion, up about 16% from the year
before.
   Campeau said the strong sales gains mainly resulted from
inclusion for the first time of Federated and Ralphs for a
full 12 months. The units, acquired in May 1988, contributed
just nine months of results to the year-earlier figures.
   But combined operating profit at Federated and Allied was
flat at $595 million. Campeau said operating retail margins
fell as a result of competitive price-cutting and higher
promotional and administrative costs. The company defined
operating profit as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization.
   Operating profit at Ralphs Grocery rose almost 33% to $158
million. Ralphs isn't in bankruptcy proceedings, but is owned
by a Campeau unit that is in Chapter 11.
   Real-estate activities generated revenue of $309 million,
up 10.4%, while operating profit rose 4.3% to $144 million.
   Financing costs, consisting of interest and the
amortization of financing expense, amounted to $1.19 billion,
compared with $877 million a year earlier.
   Campeau also had a gain of $208 million in the latest year
from the disposal of various assets, including Allied's Ann
Taylor women's-wear division and several western properties.
In the previous year, asset disposals generated a gain of
$491 million.
   Analysts said investors are hoping that Campeau officials
provide specific information at the company's annual meeting,
scheduled for mid-July, about its plans to restructure debt
and raise cash by selling additional assets. Previously,
Campeau said that it plans to sell a "substantial portion" of
its real-estate assets to restructure its ailing finances.
   In March, Campeau stopped paying interest on its 184
million Canadian dollars (US$156.8 million) of 7 1/2%
debentures. It also stopped interest payments on $260 million
of convertible debentures held by Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd., which is closely held by Toronto's Reichmann family.
   Also in March, Campeau stopped paying interest on $480
million owed to Youngstown, Ohio, developer, Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp., and $225 million owed to Olympia &amp; York.
