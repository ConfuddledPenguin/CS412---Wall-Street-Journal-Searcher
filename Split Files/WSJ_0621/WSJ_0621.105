   WASHINGTON -- President Bush has decided to name a Vermont
lawyer to the federal bench -- nearly 16 months after Sen.
James Jeffords recommended the nomination and a week after
the liberal Republican backed Mr. Bush on a veto override.
   The lawyer, Fred Parker of Weybridge, Vt., was telephoned
by Mr. Bush Tuesday night, according to Mr. Jeffords's
office, which denied any connection between the timing of the
appointment and the senator's support for a Bush veto of an
Amtrak authorization bill seven days before.

   The appointment, for the U.S. District Court in
Burlington, Vt., is subject to Senate confirmation, and Mr.
Parker is expected to win approval easily.
   Labor unions backing the Amtrak legislation initially had
counted Mr. Jeffords among their supporters in the fight,
which centered on the Bush administration's objections to a
provision requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission to
review the purchase of major freight railroads by non-rail
companies. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in
partnership with Union Pacific Corp. Chairman Drew Lewis,
painted the bill as a return to rail regulation, and a White
House lobbying campaign prevailed by a margin of two votes in
the Senate.
   In an interview before the vote, Mr. Jeffords said he
favored such legislation to deal with smaller freight lines
like those in New England, but as the provision dealt only
with Class I, or the nation's 16 biggest railroads, he felt
free to back Mr. Bush on the regulation issue. "If it's not
an issue that Jim feels affects the state or disadvantages
his constituents, he is more apt to listen to the president,"
a Jeffords aide said.
   "He was a hard vote to get," a person familiar with the
administration's lobbying said of Sen. Jeffords. "What it
took, I do not know."
   Mr. Parker's nomination is an issue that the senator has
taken personally, and he was infuriated last year over the
long delays by the White House in nominating his friend to
the federal court. In November, Mr. Jeffords held up action
on eight other nominees to register his protest, but an aide
to the senator said a reconciliation had been reached well
before the veto vote and he was only awaiting final word from
the president.
