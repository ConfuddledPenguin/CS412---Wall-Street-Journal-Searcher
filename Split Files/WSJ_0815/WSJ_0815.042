   TOKYO -- What's a hot conversational topic at Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry?
   Well, table settings. "Is it right to put Lenox china on
the same table with traditional Japanese lacquerware?"
wonders Akio Tanaka, division director at MITI, the
no-nonsense bureaucracy better known for pondering how to
build faster computers and export more automobiles. "What
settings are best for French foods?"

   In a recently released report, "Vision for the 1990s,"
MITI promised to give this hard-driving country a better
quality of life. Now the ministry is making good on that
pledge with a bold new initiative focusing on the nation's
table manners.
   MITI officials have commissioned a committee of business
and government executives to develop and promote "new ways of
dining and communicating." The committee's formal mandate is
to exchange ideas about expanding Japan's leisure and service
industries. But Mr. Tanaka, who is responsible for the
project, says the group is also a forum for discussing ways
to help Japanese consumers shed their image as nouveau riche
and become more cosmopolitan and genteel.
   MITI officials are asking companies in the food and
beverage, tableware, hotel and other industries to help the
ministry raise Japan's cultural and culinary sensitivities.
"We want to make sure that the Japanese know how to use good
products, not just make them," Mr. Tanaka says.
   The group also wants to promote the proper mix of party
guests and is looking for ways to get more women and
foreigners invited to social gatherings in Japan, Mr. Tanaka
says.
   If the project's kick-off party is any indication, the
ministry has a way to go. Gesturing apologetically around the
banquet hall at dripping ice sculptures and clusters of
blue-suited, beer-drinking Japanese businessmen, Mr. Tanaka
concedes: "Of course, this reception is rather conventional."
   The committee's first item of business when it convenes
next month will be to draft a questionnaire for housewives so
as to learn more about Japanese dining habits. Mr. Tanaka
hopes that data will help MITI and the panel to gain greater
insight into how Japanese households communicate. "Eating and
talking are activities that have always gone together," he
says.
   Let's see, isn't that known as talking with your mouth
full?
