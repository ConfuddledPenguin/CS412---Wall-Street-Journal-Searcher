   CINCINNATI -- American Financial Corp. said it is
conducting negotiations to merge its Hunter Savings
Association unit with Provident Bancorp Inc. If the merger is
completed, American Financial will receive cash and stock for
Hunter Savings. The new entity would be the third-largest
commercial bank in Cincinnati, with about $3 billion in
assets.
   American Financial is a private holding company owned by
Carl H. Linder. Provident Bancorp, a Cincinnati-based bank
holding company, was spun off from American Financial in
1980; it is also controlled by the Lindner family.
