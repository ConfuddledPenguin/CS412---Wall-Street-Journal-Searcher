   Gold, the classic hedge against surging inflation and
international turmoil, is back.
   In the past three days, the price of gold for immediate
delivery has leaped 7% to $411.50 an ounce from $383.60, as
measured by the London gold fixing.

   After falling as low as $346 an ounce in June, gold has
rebounded in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
military response by other nations and the sudden 50% price
jump in crude oil. In the past few days, buying has come from
most parts of the world: the Middle East, Europe, the Far
East, and the U.S.
   In New York, where gold futures are traded, the December
contract has risen more than $19 in the past three days, to
$414 an ounce. It rose as high as $424.70 yesterday morning
before falling back to $414, unchanged from the last trade
reported on Monday, when New York trading was disrupted by an
electrical blackout.
   Reports that Iraq has seized about $1 billion worth of
gold in Kuwait helped bring the price down from its morning
high, traders said. The concern is that Iraq will sell gold
to finance purchases of arms or food.
   Also, reports yesterday that Jordan's King Hussein will
visit the U.S. helped to bring down oil prices and, in turn,
gold prices because gold rises with inflation fears. But
those same fears will help propel it further in coming
months, many traders and analysts think. "What has changed
here is the inflationary concerns," said James Kneafsey,
president of Cambridge Financial Management. "Gold is a safe
haven from inflation."
   "It wouldn't surprise me one bit" if gold reaches $450 an
ounce this year, said Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp;
Co., a Santa Monica, Calif., precious-metals consulting firm.
He said he's seeing signs of strong interest by individual
investors for the first time in a couple of years.
   Sales of American Eagle gold coins totaled 29,000 ounces
in the first nine days of August, more than for the entire
month of July, said Joe Rosta of CPM Group Ltd., a New York
commodities information firm.
   Such trends are making many analysts sound bullish these
days, but having been burned several times by gold in the
past, they are predicting relatively modest price gains. Many
look for gold to hit $425 to $475 an ounce by year end. (A
price of $425 would keep an investor roughly even with
Treasury bills, which are much safer than gold.)
   In general, three forces strongly influence the price of
gold: international tension, inflation and the strength or
weakness of the dollar. (For gold, an ideal world is tense,
with high inflation and a weak dollar.) All three forces are
hard to predict, but bullish sentiment on gold is rising.
   "It's possible that this Iraq advance has marked a major
turning point in the gold market," said John Brimelow,
director of international research at Keane Securities in New
York. He said heavy selling by the Soviet Union depressed
prices earlier this year, but that Soviet selling seems to
have abated. "I think we have a reasonable chance of seeing
bullion prices over $450 by the end of this year," he said.
   Many technicians, who study price charts, regard the $425
level as critical for gold, because it has fallen back when
it hit that level before, including once earlier this year.
"If it gets to that level and holds it, people are going to
be very impressed . . . because a lot of people follow
charts," said Mr. Brimelow.
   "It is obvious that the Middle Eastern situation is
providing the momentum that is driving gold prices higher,"
said Vahid Fathi, analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
in Cleveland. But he sees "more fundamental reasons" why gold
should rise in the long term. The main one is that he expects
the dollar to be weak, as a weak U.S. economy leads to
falling interest rates here.
   Because the dollar and gold are considered safe havens,
they compete for dollars from frightened investors in Europe,
the Far East and elsewhere. Sometimes the two move in tandem,
but usually gold rises when the dollar falls.
   Mr. Kneafsey of Cambridge Financial Management said his
guess is that gold will end the year at between $425 and $475
an ounce, though he thinks $500 or better is possible.
   "Gold has been out of favor the last six or seven years as
an investment medium," said Harry Conger, chief executive
officer of Homestake Mining Co. "Now we are seeing a revival
of interest . . . because of political events." He thinks
South Africa, which mines 40% of the world's gold, "is going
to experience a reduction in its gold output because the cost
of social changes will be reflected in greater production
costs." His prediction: Gold will rise to $450 or $500 by
year end.
   Jeffrey A. Nichols of American Precious Metals Advisors in
Toronto thinks $420 to $430 an ounce is a likely year-end
price, but said "there's the potential for a much sharper
move." Long term, he's bullish because he said supply and
demand are in "tight" balance. Gold jewelry sales have been
rising world-wide at 24% to 26% a year, he said.
   Bernard Savaiko, analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New
York, said, "Gold is going up for the wrong reason." People
who expect a replay of the inflation of the 1970s will be
disappointed, he said, partly because the Federal Reserve
system is trying to keep a tighter lid on inflation now.
Nevertheless, he thinks it's possible that gold might reach
$435 this year.
   In other precious-metals news, December silver yesterday
showed a gain of 23 cents an ounce, settling at $5.3320,
while October platinum was up $6.20 an ounce from Friday at
$502.50, but down $3.50 from Monday's last trade of $506.00.
   After the close of trading yesterday, the Commodity
Exchange increased original margins, or good-faith money, for
gold and silver futures contracts by $400 per contract to
$1,700.

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices advanced as
several professional speculators covered "short" positions by
purchasing futures contracts to offset those sold earlier on
a bet that prices would fall. One active Chicago speculator,
Richard Dennis, was rumored to have bought futures contracts
equal to as many as 10 million bushels of soybeans. Mr.
Dennis as a matter of policy doesn't comment on trading
positions he is rumored to have taken. Analysts said they
expect soybean futures prices to trade in a choppy sideways
pattern for several weeks until this year's crop is closer to
being harvested. Soybean futures for November delivery gained
6.25 cents a bushel to close at $6.26575 a bushel. December
corn futures also advanced, closing 1.25 cents a bushel
higher at $2.425. Wheat futures prices reversed a recent
slide and advanced modestly. December wheat futures gained
3.5 cents a bushel to close at $2.9425.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were firm compared with Monday's
last trades but only moderately above Friday's close. The
September contract ended at $1.3285 a pound. This was up 2.75
cents from the last trade Monday at $1.3010, but only 0.85
cent higher than Friday's close of $1.3200. Demand for
futures contracts continued despite a rise in the London
Metal Exchange warehouse inventories of copper, which have
more than doubled over the past month. Figures released
yesterday showed an increase of 6,800 tons to 122,400 tons.
As recently as early July, these stocks were below 47,000
tons. Traders and analysts have been at a loss to explain how
prices have kept surging despite the increase in these
visible supplies. "All I can say," one analyst said, "is that
sooner or later traders are going to pay attention to the
stock increases and prices will begin to reflect these rising
supplies." Japanese demand for copper continued in London,
analysts said. Reports that a Peruvian mining union has
threatened to go on strike tomorrow also helped firm prices,
analysts said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were higher. The October contract
ended with a gain of 0.29 cent a pound, compared with
Monday's last trade and Friday's close. The market is being
supported by the perception that there is underlying demand
for sugar just underneath current price levels, according to
one analyst. This is particularly true with respect to China,
he said. That nation recently has bought about 250,000 tons
of sugar in several purchases and in his view will need to
buy more sugar. The analyst disputed perceptions that China
will scale back its buying and said that at the very least it
won't buy less than last year. If there is any decline in
buying, it will be very slight, he said. "China needs to buy
sugar, particularly because of its increasing population," he
said.
