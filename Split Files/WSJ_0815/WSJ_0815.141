   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., the French pharmaceuticals
company, reported a net loss for the second quarter totaling
$178.1 million and a six-month loss of $185.8 million.
   The company's latest quarter and six months results
include operations of Rhone-Poulenc's human pharmaceutical
business since May 5, the date of change of control when
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. completed its tender offer for just over
50% of Rorer Group Inc.'s shares. The reported results prior
to May 1990 do not include any results from the human
pharmaceuticals business.

   The quarterly and half-year losses include restructuring
and special charges of $262.4 million and $289.3 million for
the respective periods. These charges represent current and
future estimated one-time costs.
   The Department of Justice said last week that it would
seek to block a proposed strategic alliance between
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Failure to
complete the transaction in 1990 would result in about $30
million of lower pretax income as compared to previously
projected 1990 results, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said.
