   NEW YORK -- Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the last of Wall
Street's big private investment banks, said Robert E. Rubin
and Stephen Friedman will become senior partners and
co-chairmen.
   They succeed John L. Weinberg, who retires as senior
partner and chairman Nov. 30.

   Messrs. Rubin, 51 years old, and Friedman, 52, have been
heirs apparent to the job since John Whitehead resigned as
co-chairman six years ago, leaving Mr. Weinberg in sole
control. Since 1987, Messrs. Rubin and Friedman have been
co-vice chairmen, a post Goldman says it has no plans to
fill.
   The appointments mark the end of the old guard at the
121-year-old firm: The Whitehead-Weinberg team at Goldman
dates back to the early 1950s. And it represents a return to
the unusual co-chairmanship style of management at Goldman,
which many consider one of the best-run firms on Wall Street.
   Mr. Rubin says he and his partner will continue to
"modernize Goldman Sachs. Make sure it's an international
firm, make sure it's an effective presence in Europe." But
basically "continue to do the things we've been doing," he
says.
   During his 14 years as senior partner, Mr. Weinberg, 65,
oversaw a rapidly growing firm. Goldman's equity capital
during that time grew to $2.3 billion from about $80 million,
and the firm's annual profits have jumped tenfold.
   Despite its success, however, Goldman has dealt with
several sensitive issues in recent years. It has withstood
the 1987 arrest and subsequent guilty plea of Robert M.
Freeman, Goldman's powerful head of risk arbitrage, on
insider trading charges, although the firm has never been
sanctioned for Mr. Freeman's activities.
   Mr. Weinberg says the firm is in "excellent condition."
Mr. Weinberg, who will continue with the firm as senior
chairman, said in a memo to employees that Goldman "has a
strong capital position and our earnings are currently
somewhat ahead of last year's results." He wouldn't
elaborate, but said the company's results this year will fall
short of its record year in 1988.
   The succession will surely lead to changes, even at a firm
as steeped in tradition as Goldman, analysts say. Because of
a jump in the firm's partners the last several years --
Goldman now has 128 -- Messrs. Rubin and Friedman will face
increasing pressure to boost the firm's pretax income,
analysts say.
   "There will be more emphasis on areas of the business that
provide a steady stream of revenue," says Perrin Long, senior
securities analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   Goldman is likely to place more emphasis on money
management, which provide steady fees even when markets
falter. Indeed, Goldman recently launched its first stock
mutual fund that caters to small investors; the GS Capital
Growth Fund requires a minimum investment of just $1,200. And
Goldman also just raised about $700 million for a fund that
would invest large amounts of cash in a small number of
financially strapped companies.
   The firm may also look to provide more innovative types of
financing, analysts and securities executives say. And it is
likely to bolster its already-strong global presence, given
the success there of rival Morgan Stanley Group Inc.
   "This suggests that Goldman will change its stripes a
little bit and not be as ultraconservative," Mr. Long says.
   Still, the announced appointments fit Goldman's reputation
for methodical management changes.
   Goldman is "very sensitive to succession. You don't see
many abrupt senior-management changes at that firm," says
Kenneth Leibler, president and chief operating officer of
Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.'s Liberty Financial Cos. in
Boston and former president of the American Stock Exchange.
"They probably operate in the smoothest fashion of any
securities firm in terms of planned transitions."
   What won't change with the new appointments, securities
executives say, is Goldman's aversion to the junk bonds and
temporary "bridge" loans that tripped up much of Wall Street
in the late 1980s. But the firm will continue to forge ahead
as an underwriting powerhouse, particularly in stock
offerings, analysts say.
   This year through Aug. 13, Goldman ranked No. 2 behind
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in disclosed fees from underwriting
stocks and bonds, taking in $193.9 million on 137 issues, for
a 13.7% market share, according to Securities Data Co.
   Goldman in recent years has talked of issuing shares to
the public, but rejected the idea. Asked if Goldman would
ever go public, Mr. Weinberg said no. "But forever is a long
time," he added.
   Attempts at dual leaders typically have failed on
ego-sensitive Wall Street. But Mr. Weinberg says his
successors won't have such problems: "They're very
simpatico." Mr. Rubin said clients will know early on that he
and Mr. Friedman are equals.
   "Weinberg and Whitehead used to have a saying: `If you
post one of us, you post both of us,'" Mr. Rubin said.
   Messrs. Rubin and Friedman say they have no grand plans
for changing the firm's philosophy or strategy, except to
continue to "modernize" Goldman Sachs, which includes new
services, locations and products. Instead, the two plan to
address issues as they come up.
   "I can't today think of a single thing I'm frustrated
about" and would like to do different, Mr. Friedman says.
   Image-conscious Goldman has faced several civil lawsuits
over the past year stemming from alleged personal and
professional abuses by Goldman partners, including highly
publicized sexual harrassment allegations against a top
Goldman partner, Lewis Eisenberg, who subsequently resigned.
Mr. Eisenberg denied the harrassment allegations.
   Nevertheless, executives agree that Goldman is under
scrutiny for how it treats and promotes its women employees.
Later this year, Goldman will appoint a number of new
partners, as it does every two years. The firm currently has
only one woman partner. Mr. Rubin said that Goldman "has a
large number of very attractive candidates" for partners,
including women.
   Messrs. Rubin and Friedman, who both have law degrees,
have worked together in various positions at the firm,
including co-heads of the fixed-income department from 1985
to 1988. Mr. Rubin, who is active in Democratic politics and
raised funds for presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, has
handled much of Goldman's dealings with the public in recent
years. He joined the firm in 1966, became partner in 1971, a
member of the management committee in 1980 and co-vice
chairman in 1987.
   Before co-heading fixed income, he headed Goldman's
trading and arbitrage division; he also has had management
responsibility for J. Aron &amp; Co., the firm's commodity and
foreign-exchange subsidiary.
   Mr. Friedman joined Goldman in 1966, was elected partner
in 1973, became a member of the management committee in 1982
and vice chairman in 1987. Among other things, he headed
Goldman's mergers and acquisitions department.
   Although they will work together, Messrs. Rubin and
Friedman will gravitate toward different areas. For example,
Mr. Rubin tends to focus on clients in Mexico, Spain and
Puerto Rico, while Mr. Friedman focuses on clients in France
and the U.S. West Coast. The two new co-chairmen say
expanding globally is a priority; the firm is opening a
Frankfurt office this autumn, its first in Germany.
   But Goldman will concentrate on European countries with
developed markets, rather than some of the fledgling
democracies in Eastern Europe.
   "It's very hard to do equity offerings when people don't
know what stocks are, don't have a stock exchange and don't
have convertible currencies," Mr. Friedman said.
