   Williamstown, Mass. -- Among the summer theaters that dot
the landscape like mosquitoes at a cookout, the Williamstown
Theater Festival is sui generis. Nestled in the Berkshire
mountains on the Williams College campus, the festival is now
in its 36th year. For most of those years the theater was
guided by the irrepressible Nikos Psacharopoulos. A man of
ineffable charm, no one knew more than he did about the care
and feeding of stage and film stars. Partly because of the
ambiance he created, and partly because of the loveliness of
the area, each year well-known performers would return to
Williamstown to take a respite from their commercial ventures
and appear in a classic by Chekhov or Pirandello.
   James Naughton, the star of Broadway's "City of Angels,"
has built a home here, as has Superman's Christopher Reeve.
Actresses Blythe Danner and Maria Tucci rented houses each
year to be in residence and provide for their children's
summer fun.

   A year-and-a-half ago, however, Mr. Psacharopoulos
suddenly and unexpectedly died. He has been replaced by a
Williamstown old-timer, Peter Hunt. A veteran lighting
designer and director who is best known for his work on the
musical "1776," Mr. Hunt works in both New York and Hollywood
but has a special affection for Williamstown, where he has
been involved in 103 productions over a span of 27 seasons.
   Now, with the penultimate play of his first year it is
possible to get some idea of how he will fare as Mr.
Psacharopoulos's successor. To begin with, it should be said
that for all his charisma, Mr. Psacharopoulos could be
exasperating. The season frequently was a moving target; if
one of Mr. Psacharopoulos's favorite actresses suddenly made
it known she was available, he would scrap a planned
production and substitute a Tennessee Williams play. Also,
his renowned Chekhov offerings were often underrehearsed and
uneven.
   The first thing Mr. Hunt has done is introduce a measure
of planning and ordera very necessary ingredient if a theater
is to survive over the long term. To aid in this he has
appointed a well-known theater administrator, William
Stewart, as managing director. At the same time, Mr. Hunt has
developed a balanced program for the year: two lightweight
presentations, "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum" and "Harvey"; two ambitious works, Peter Weiss's
"Marat/Sade" and O'Neill's "A Moon for the Misbegotten"; and
the current offering, "Death Takes a Holiday," which manages
to be both slight and serious.
   This is just the kind of play a theater like Williamstown
should be producing. Written by the Italian playwright
Alberto Casella in the late 1920s and presented in this
country in an adaptation by Walter Ferris, it has not been
professionally produced here in well over a quarter of a
century. Set in an ornate Italian villa in which the designer
Hugh Landwehr has included echoes of the Gothic and baroque,
it tells the story of Death, in the person of Christopher
Reeve, deciding to take a three-day holiday. Duke Lambert
(Mr. Morfogen) and his friends have just returned to his
villa after a wild ride through the countryside in their two
cars. Both cars have been in serious accidents, but no one
has died. Late at night, the Duke learns why: Death,
enveloped in a black cape, appears out of the moonlight to
tell him that he plans to take three days off, during which
time no one will die. (We later hear that a man has plunged
from the Eiffel Tower without being killed.)
   The reason for the holiday is that Death wants to
experience life -- to enjoy beauty, to fall in love, to sleep
at night. "I haven't slept in ages," he says. The Duke and
Death conspire on a plan for him to be a guest in the house
for his three days. An expected visitor, Prince Sirki, is not
arriving because he had encountered Death earlier that
evening. "If I'd known he was a friend of yours, I would not
have met with him," Death tells the Duke. For his disguise,
Death becomes Prince Sirki.
   Those on hand at the villa include the Duke's wife and
son, an eccentric female visitor (Ms. Tucci), the Princess of
San Luca (Ms. Danner) and her daughter Grazia (Calista
Flockhart), engaged to the Duke's son (James Phoenix). The
entourage are all aristocrats, the men dressing for dinner
not just in tuxedoes but in tails, and there is something
both civilized and decadent about their life-style. The women
are simultaneously frightened and fascinated by the dashing
figure of Prince Sirki, who symbolizes death's fatal
attraction. As for the Prince, he decides that Grazia, the
appealing young bride-to-be, is the woman he will pursue. And
she falls in love with Death -- a romantic notion carried to
extreme.
   The play is pretentious in places, with portentous
discussions of how the living fail to live life to the
fullest, and in the second and third acts it slows to a crawl
more than once. On the whole, though, it is an effective
melodrama with just enough humor to prevent its being
meretricious. Mostly, it is a marvelous vehicle for the
longtime Williamstown favorites Mr. Hunt has assembled. Mr.
Morfogen is an authoritative but thoroughly alarmed Duke, Ms.
Danner and Ms. Tucci are fatally attractive themselves, and
newcomer Calista Flockhart is an appealing ingenue.
   As Death, Mr. Reeve is having a real holiday himself.
Eerily forbidding while wearing his cape and death mask, he
becomes a suave, enigmatic lover with palpably irresistible
charms. The saving grace for Mr. Reeve, as for the other
principals, is his sense of humor. With Mr. Hunt's guidance
the cast members successfully walk the thin line separating
camp from genuine humor. Watching them tear into this Gothic
romance, one realizes that the old hands at Williamstown have
decided to make the transition from the old to the new regime
without giving up the spontaneity and excitement of the
Psacharopoulos era, and while adding some stability and
common sense.
