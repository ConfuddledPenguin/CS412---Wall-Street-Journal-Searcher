   Eastern Airlines reported a second-quarter loss of $35.6
million, a deficit that would have been four times as deep
without asset sales.
   In addition, the Miami-based carrier, still operating
under Bankruptcy Court protection, said it expects to have
losses for the rest of the year as fuel prices continue to
rise and it struggles to rebuild its operations.

   Eastern said it had gains of $114.8 million in the latest
quarter from asset sales. A year earlier, it had a $129.3
million loss after gains of $261.8 million. Revenue for the
quarter was $545.2 million, up substantially from last year's
$89.6 million, when Eastern was practically shut down by a
strike.
   Despite the narrower loss and the revenue gain, other
signposts don't bode well for Eastern. The airline filled
61.5% of its seats in the first six months, far below its
break-even point. And that traffic came from highly seasonal,
heavily discounted tickets.
   A bankruptcy judge in April wrested control of the airline
from its parent, Continental Airline Holdings Inc. (formerly
Texas Air Corp.), and the airline said bookings fell for
April and May as a result of the bad publicity.
   For the six months, the airline had a net loss of $172
million on revenue of $1.1 billion. For the 1989 first half,
the net loss was $384.5 million on revenue of $710.2 million.
   Meanwhile, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York granted
Eastern temporary relief from major provisions in its labor
contract with pilots.
   "It is clear that prompt cost reductions, including pilot
labor cost reductions, are essential if an imminent
liquidation of the estate is to be avoided," Judge Burton
Lifland said in his ruling.
   The pilots' union issued a statement saying it was
disappointed but not surprised by the court action. "We'll
consider whether to appeal," Richard Seltzer, an attorney for
the Air Line Pilots Association, said. "We think this
decision was without a basis in fact and in law."
