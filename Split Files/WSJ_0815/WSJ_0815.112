   WINDSOR, Ont. -- Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee A. Iacocca
said the auto maker has discussed potential ties with three
European manufacturers, but said there won't be an agreement
within the next month and dismissed the possibility of a
full-scale merger.
   Mr. Iacocca, speaking at a plant ceremony marking the
start of production for the 1991 minivans, said Chrysler has
talked with Regie Nationale des Usines Renault of France,
Volvo AB of Sweden and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. He also said
Chrysler has talked with several other auto companies about
possible arrangements.

   The negotiations with Fiat have sparked speculation in
Europe and the U.S. that the Italian company may agree to
distribute Chrysler products in Europe, help Chrysler develop
new vehicles or, possibly, buy a sizable equity stake in
Chrysler.
   Mr. Iacocca said an equity stake by another auto maker in
Chrysler isn't imminent, but may come in the future.
   The company later clarified Mr. Iacocca's comments about
Renault and Volvo talks, saying those discussions primarily
involve "commercial arrangements."
   Chrysler shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday to $13.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "Everybody's talking to everybody," Mr. Iacocca said. "I
think over time everybody's going to need some kind of
affiliation or partnership."
