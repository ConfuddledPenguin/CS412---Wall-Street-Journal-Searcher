   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it will next
month begin trading its first futures contracts based on
Japanese stock and bond markets.
   The exchange said it will launch long-term Japanese
Government Bond futures and futures-options trading Sept. 27,
along with its so-called TOPIX futures and options, which
will be based on the Tokyo Stock Price Index.

   The CBOT and the Tokyo Stock Exchange agreed in 1988 to
cooperate in launching TOPIX and Japanese Government Bond
futures at the CBOT, and U.S. Treasury bond futures at the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Uncertainty caused by the 1987 stock-market crash slowed
development of the plan. The recent sharp decline in prices
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased interest in financial
instruments that would allow investors to hedge holdings in
Japanese stocks, similar to the measures currently afforded
by futures contracts based on such U.S. market indicators as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
