   Pepsi-Cola Co. is expected to name David Novak, the senior
marketing executive of PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut division, as
the top marketing official at the No. 2 soft-drink company.
   Mr. Novak will succeed Michael D. Simpson, a former
Kellogg Co. executive, who had been named Pepsi's executive
vice president, marketing and national sales, barely a year
ago. The brevity of Mr. Simpson's rein was unusual, but
apparently didn't reflect any major blunders on his part.

   Mr. Novak, 37 years old, has been the major force behind
some of Pizza Hut's most effective marketing strategies in
recent years. He helped build the chain from a fledgling in
the fast-growing delivery business to a major player, despite
the dominance of Domino's Pizza Inc. in that area. He was
instrumental in the development of "Pizza Pairs," two pies
for a reduced price.
   He was also behind a recent marketing push to reach youth.
Some marketing experts, however, questioned the effectiveness
of Pizza Hut's current sponsorship of a concert tour of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, given that the creatures have
been used in a host of endorsements in the past year.
   In confirming the management succession, which could be
announced today, a Pepsi spokesman said that 40-year-old Mr.
Simpson remains an executive vice president, but is now
responsible for customer relations on major fountain,
bottling and can accounts. The appointment is merely a
"reflection of an expanded focus to customer service," the
spokesman said.
   Mr. Simpson was instrumental in Pepsi's successful "cool
cans" promotion, the spokesman added. Under the promotion,
Pepsi lined grocery-store shelves with Pepsi cans with bright
graphics, including a surfer and a woman in sunglasses.
   Still, one industry executive familiar with Pepsi and Mr.
Simpson said the brief tenure reflects differences in
management styles. Mr. Simpson was "used to the consistent,
plodding pace of a company that introduces a new cereal every
two years," said the executive. "He didn't make any big
mistakes, but he just didn't make a dramatic mark on the
business."
   It is generally difficult to transfer marketers from more
conservative packaged goods companies to the fast-paced,
franchise-based soft-drink world, industry executives said.
Unlike many consumer-products companies, soda concerns must
rely on a complex web of franchised bottlers for
distribution. Also, compared to many kinds of consumer goods,
soft drinks are more sensitive to price fluctuations and are
pushed with advertising that is more heavily image-oriented.
"It's very tough for people to make the transition," between
the businesses, said Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing
Spectrum Inc., an Atlanta consulting company.
   Nonetheless, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola Co. had broken with
tradition in the past year and appointed outsiders into top
marketing jobs. In April, Coke's U.S. division named Theodore
J. Host as senior vice president, marketing. Mr. Host was
formerly an executive with Boyle-Midway Household Products
Inc., which makes Woolite, Easy Off and Black Flag. Industry
executives believe the soft-drink rivals were seeking to
breathe some fresh air into their promotional strategies, to
wrest market share from each other amid softer industry
growth.
