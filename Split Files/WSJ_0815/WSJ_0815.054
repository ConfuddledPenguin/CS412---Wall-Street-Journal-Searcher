   ZAMBIAN DEMOCRACY

   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, reacting to growing
pressure from pro-democracy activists, launched a campaign
against the revival of a multiparty system in Zambia.
   Mr. Kaunda, who abolished political pluralism in 1973,
accused the pro-democracy movement of receiving funds from
outside the country and of abusing the freedom to campaign
ahead of a referendum on multiparty rule.
   Economic hardship sparked riots in June, and 27 people
were killed. Afterward, Mr. Kaunda promised a referendum on
the multiparty issue in October but later postponed it until
next August.
   The pro-democracy movement, which has received powerful
church backing, is due to hold its first public rally on
Saturday in Kabwe, 125 miles north of Lusaka.
   Mr. Kaunda said an extraordinary national council in
mid-September would consider proposals by a parliamentary
committee on ways to make the ruling United National
Independence Party more democratic. These include
restrictions on presidential tenure to two five-year terms
and open elections for the post.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET PRESS LAW
                                                                                                       

   The government newspaper Izvestia became the first Soviet
publication to register under a new press law guaranteeing
freedom from decades of state censorship. Meanwhile, the
State Press Committee announced a doubling in the price of
many publications, citing increases in the cost of paper,
printing equipment and transportation. Book prices are also
expected to more than double, officials said.
                                                                                                       

   BRITAIN'S UNSTATELY HOMES
                                                                                                       

   An Englishman's home may be his castle, but a record
14,390 British homeowners had their houses repossessed in the
first half this year, double the number of repossessions in
the second half of last year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders
reported. Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building
Societies Association, said continuing high interest rates --
around 15% -- were the main cause of the sharp rise in
repossessions. The previous repossession record, 11,700 in
the first half of 1987, was related to a miners' strike.
                                                                                                       

   PAKISTANI `BLOOD MONEY'
                                                                                                       

   Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued an ordinance
allowing convicted murderers to financially compensate heirs
of their victims in exchange for clemency. The order is
effective for six months, after which it requires the
approval of parliament.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ'S ASIAN GAMES
                                                                                                       

   Iraq will send athletes to the Asian Games in China, an
Iraqi embassy spokesman in Beijing said. The report in a
Japanese press agency said there is growing concern that
Iraq's presence at the games along with other Arab teams may
disrupt the event because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
games are scheduled for Sept. 22 to Oct. 6.
                                                                                                       

   LUMBERING EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East German farmers and lumbermen, among the workers
hardest hit by the massive changes sweeping their country,
drove tractors, combines and lumber trucks into West Berlin
to demand higher wages, job security and other help from the
East and West German governments. Imports from the West have
cut demand for East German products. Inefficiency is another
bone of contention: "We have such old machines, some of them
made before the war," said 20-year-old protester Alexander
Witt. "We're supposed to compete in a capitalist system, but
it's hard with such old machines that often break down and
need repairs and maintenance."
                                                                                                       

   VIOLENT BANGLADESH DOCTORS
                                                                                                       

   Striking doctors trying to force the withdrawal of new
medical rules attacked the office of the director of Dhaka
Medical College Hospital and threatened widespread violence.
   Witnesses said groups of young doctors stormed the office
of Director Mohammad Anwar Ali Chowdhury, broke furniture and
set fire to his chair. Patients, many of whom have lacked
care for weeks, took cover as chanting doctors marched toward
the director's room, a witness said.
   Medical services in Bangladesh have been at a virtual
standstill, except for emergency cases, since July 28, when
15,000 doctors, the vast majority of Bangladesh's practicing
physicians, went on strike. They are trying to force
President Hossain Mohammad Ershad to withdraw proposed rules
requiring specialists to stop private practice and junior
doctors to work in villages under rural authorities.
   Doctors have denounced the rules as infringing upon their
professional freedom, saying they will resign unless the
government meets their demands.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   More than 220,000 Czechs who suffered under Communist rule
will probably share around $95 million in compensation.
Officials said those eligible include people subjected to
political trials between the Communist Party's takeover of
power in 1948 and its ousting less than a year ago. . . .
Students in Shanghai were warned by an official newspaper
against using Chinese renminbi, the "people's money," to make
intricate origami handicraft figures. The Youth Post said the
folding-money fad "shows a lack of respect and also increases
the burden on banks."
