   NEW YORK -- The blackout that hit lower Manhattan on
Monday could have been a lot worse.
   With power restored yesterday to all but 1,100 commercial
and residential customers, a handful of banks and securities
firms were still experiencing difficulties -- either shut
down or working with skeleton staffs, a few in the dark.

   Their plight demonstrated the vulnerability of crowded
urban electric transmission systems to spot failures, even
when power remains plentiful.
   Despite the fire that ripped through its South Street
Seaport substation shortly after noon, Consolidated Edison
Co. of New York was able to restore power to most of the
36-square block area blacked out in lower Manhattan's
financial district Monday within five or six hours. While the
fire effectively knocked out the "local lanes" of traffic,
Con Ed said, the "express lanes" were undamaged and available
for the restoration effort.
   The noonday fire at Con Ed initially affected all five
138,000-volt cables that run into the station. A couple of
cables automatically "tipped," or shut down, while the others
were quickly shut down by Con Ed from its Upper West Side
control center in hopes of limiting the damage. With the
cables out, thousands of Wall Street workers were plunged
into darkness, trapped in elevators and left staring at blank
computer screens.
   Because of the fire's intensity, Con Ed personnel
dispatched immediately to the usually unmanned substation,
couldn't get inside to assess the damage until midafternoon.
They discovered that the fire hadn't damaged the four cables
that simply run through the South Street station on their way
to the World Trade Center substation. According to Con Ed,
just two of those four cables are needed to serve the area
around the World Trade Center, and they were quickly
re-energized.
   The fire did, however, knock out the 13 cables that
deliver 13,000-volt power, which has been "stepped down," or
transformed from the 138,000 volts entering the substation,
to some 1,100 commercial and residential customers in the
vicinity of the South Street facility. Yesterday, Con Ed said
those 13 cables will remain out of service for the
foreseeable future, with backup generator service going only
to certain emergency power users, such as nursing homes. Con
Ed said some customers and street signals should see power
restored by tomorrow. The rest won't likely be back on line
before next Monday.
   While the nation's electric reliability concerns have
focused recently on fears of blackouts due to overburdened
generating capacity, the substation fire demonstrates another
vulnerability. The U.S. electrical grid has many
interconnections between individual utilities, forming a
number of regionwide safety nets intended to insure that
whenever a utility power plant goes down, power from other
utilities can quickly take its place. But when a key link in
a constricted transmission and distribution network goes out,
as Monday's fire demonstrated, the only recourse is to
reroute power, if possible, or repair the broken link. Con Ed
said it could take a year or more to completely repair its
burned out substation.
   Meanwhile, trading rooms at Credit Suisse were closed
yesterday, as were those at Nomura Securities Co. The
essential trading systems and market support activities at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. were up and running, albeit
on auxiliary power sources. Britain's National Westminster
Bank Corp. said portions of its New York trading room
remained inoperative. However, the bank said it was able to
disperse its trading operations to various locations in New
York, Delaware and New Jersey.
   Some currency dealers complained that some of their
computer trading screens were out, and some interdealer
brokers which act as intermediaries between traders in the
foreign exchange and U.S. government securities markets were
shut. That tended to make trading less efficient.
   Some firms just made due. Nomura employees assembled on a
sidewalk in front of the company's darkened building at 7:30
a.m. yesterday, after which unit heads dispersed their staffs
to other companies around the city. Some Nomura executives
worked out of their apartments, while Makoto Takahashi, an
executive vice president, went to work in the company's
deserted offices and kept in contact with clients using a
cellular telephone.
   What's next? "It's 7:30 on the curb every morning until
the power's back on," said Terence Dolce, a vice president of
planning at Nomura.
