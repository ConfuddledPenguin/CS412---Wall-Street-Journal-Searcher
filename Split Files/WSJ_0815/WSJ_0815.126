   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bank of America said it led a 26-member
underwriting syndicate in the sale yesterday of a $4.1
billion issue of revenue anticipation notes for the state of
California.
   The state said it was the largest issue of its kind in
state history. Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica Corp.,
added it was the largest such syndicate it ever led.

   The notes, which mature on June 28, 1991, were sold at a
net interest of 6.05%, according to the California State
Treasurer's office. Proceeds of the issue are expected to
fund the state's cash-flow management program for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1991.
   Bank of America said the issue received a rating of MIG-1
from Moody's Investors Service Inc., and SP-1+ from Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. Both represent the highest possible rating on
short-term municipal notes, the bank added.
