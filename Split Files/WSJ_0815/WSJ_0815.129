   Stage II Apparel Corp., a distributor of low-priced casual
clothing for men and boys, reported a second-quarter loss on
a plunge in sales, which the company blamed on the bankruptcy
court filing of Ames Department Stores Inc., a major
customer.
   New York-based Stage II reported a $750,000 loss, compared
with earnings of $379,000 in the second quarter of last year.
Sales dropped 24% to $15.4 million from $20.2 million in the
second quarter of 1989.

   Thomas Hammill, the company's controller, declined to
specify how much of the sales decline resulted from the
halting of shipments to Ames in the wake of its Chapter 11
filing. He added, however, that Stage II had resumed shipping
to Ames as part of the retailer's reorganization plan.
   "The financial results for the rest of this year will be
no worse than those of this quarter, and I am confident that
the company will return to profitability in the near future,"
said Stage II Chairman Jack Clark in a prepared statement.
