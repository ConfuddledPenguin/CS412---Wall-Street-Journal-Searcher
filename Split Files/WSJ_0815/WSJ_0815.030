   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Mid-America Bancorp Inc. said it has
submitted a proposal through the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. to Resolution Trust Corp. to acquire the assets and
assume the liabilities of Future Federal Savings Bank, a
mutual savings association, of Louisville, Ky.
   According to the bank holding company's proposal, business
operations would continue at all Future Federal branch
locations. If consummated, Mid-America expects the
acquisition to have a positive impact on the company's
earnings. Mid-America said there is no assurance that its
proposal will be accepted.
