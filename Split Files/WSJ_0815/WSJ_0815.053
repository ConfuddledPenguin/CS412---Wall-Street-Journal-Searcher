   How many weeks or months of a normal life-time does the
average American spend opening and discarding junk mail or
answering junk phone calls? With each of these usually
unwelcome messages, we feel the impact of a big business: the
collecting, collating and selling of personal information.
The data derive from transactions with mail order houses,
credit card firms, charities or other organizations --
dealings one might have considered private at the time. Yet
sale of the personal data surrendered there supports
activities that erode our privacy. Though we are the unique
sources of such information, we have little control over its
use, and no share in the profits from that use.
   An enlightened measure could redress these inequities. We
should establish for every individual a form of property
right over commercial use of his or her own data. Everyone
could withhold, sell or give away rights to commercial sale
or exchange of information about himself or herself. Some
privacy-loving citizens would no doubt exercise the right
never to have their data disclosed. But most Americans, I
suspect, would want to release at least some of their data,
if paid for the use of their "data rights."

   Creation of such rights would immediately spark the birth
of a new kind of firm, specializing in brokering such rights
on behalf of private individuals. Everyone consenting to any
release of personal information would retain a data rights
agent, who would establish a computerized account for each
client. Every time an organization sold or traded its mailing
list, it would be legally obliged to collect royalties for
the individuals concerned, along with its own fees for the
sale. Once a year, let's say, such royalties would be
forwarded to the agent, and thence to the individual.
   The feasibility of such procedures is assured by the same
technologies that make computerized mass marketing possible
in the first place. Computers excel at keeping track of
billions of discrete items of data, and processing them
quickly and cheaply. Registering, and paying for, the
hundreds of millions of data exchanges that fuel mass
marketing would be demanding. But it would be no more
demanding than tracking the income sources of millions of
less-than-universally-cooperative taxpayers, or indeed, than
targeting individuals for personalized mass-market appeals in
the first place.
   The economics would clearly attract both consumers as
participants and entrepreneurs as agents. Imagine a family
that receives, say, five hundred items of junk mail per year.
Royalties of $0.20 per item would yield an annual payment of
$100minus, to be sure, a certain percentage as commission to
the agent. The agent would have a healthy and well-informed
interest in monitoring the release of personal data and
making sure that all such transactions resulted in royalty
payments. Agents would compete with one another in securing
high royalties for their clients and in ensuring that all
royalties due were paid.
   Best of all, establishing this new right over personal
data would simultaneously reduce the quantity of unsolicited
communications and raise their quality. If commercial users
of personal data had to compensate individuals for attending
to these appeals, they would surely be more selective in
making them.
   Who could oppose this elegantly simple and flexible
privacy protection measure? Only organizations that now
appropriate personal data for nothing. Their inevitable
protest will be that establishing individual data rights will
undermine the "free flow" of information. But under present
conditions, such freedom reigns for everyone except the
"private" parties whose lives are the targets of these
transactions. Nor would this proposal limit vigorous public
discourse. Creating individual data rights would constrain
only the sale or trading of information for commercial use,
not disclosure for journalistic presentation or for public
debate.
   Celebrities have long held the right to profit from, or to
deny altogether, the commercial appropriation of their names.
"Private" citizens deserve no less say in the commercial
exploitation of their lives.
