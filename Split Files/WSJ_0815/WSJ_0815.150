   TORONTO -- Shares of Cineplex Odeon plunged 15% after the
company said it may not be able to complete the $31.8 million
sale of some of its U.S. theater assets to Plitt Amusement
Co. of Los Angeles.
   The transaction is one of several sales announced by the
troubled Toronto-based movie-theater exhibition chain as part
of a commitment to its bankers to raise net proceeds of $200
million through asset sales by the end of 1990. In the first
six months of 1990, Cineplex completed the ten asset sales,
for total gross proceeds of about $97 million. Two other
transactions, valued at about $76.8 million and including the
Plitt sale, are pending.

   Cineplex said the Plitt transaction, which was slated to
close July 31, has had its closing date extended to today to
allow the two parties to continue negotiations. But Cineplex
said in a release that "there is substantial uncertainty as
to whether the transaction will close" and that "to date . .
. negotiations have not been successful."
   Cineplex didn't give any reason for the uncertainty
surrounding the proposed sale and a spokeswoman declined to
elaborate. Individuals in the industry familiar with the
transaction said it apparently is foundering over financing.
   The sources said that, as part of a generally more
conservative approach to lending, banks seem to be unwilling
to finance an acquisition valued at more than six times cash
flow. The Plitt sale has an indicated value of eight times
cash flow, analysts said.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Cineplex closed at $3.125, off 50 cents, on volume
of 317,900 shares.
   Lisbeth Barron, vice president, research, at S.G. Warburg
&amp; Co. in New York, said that while theater acquisitions at
eight times cash flow are being financed, "they have to be
really healthy chains in prime locations."
   Ms. Barron said she would find seven times cash flow a
fair value for the theaters Cineplex has agreed to sell to
Plitt, but added that the buyer's bankers may be using
financing as a negotiating tactic.
   "At the moment, no other buyer has emerged for those
assets," she said, adding: "When you're in Cineplex's place,
you don't have a lot of clout."
   Despite a market characterized by overcapacity, Allen
Karp, Cineplex's president and chief executive officer, has
said repeatedly that he isn't prepared to accept what he
calls "fire sale prices" for the company's theaters.
   If Cineplex doesn't meet the $200 million asset-sale
target set by its bankers, its two major shareholders, MCA
Inc. and Montreal's Bronfman family, have agreed to chip in a
total of $100 million to pay down debt. In April, Mr. Karp
said the company would have no difficulty reaching that
target.
   Cineplex plans to sell its interest in the 18-screen
Universal City Cinemas of Universal City, Calif., to an MCA
unit for $45 million, a sale that a Cineplex spokeswoman said
is still set to close by Sept. 30. "We don't expect {the
Plitt sale} to have any effect on that deal," she said.
   Cineplex said it plans to pursue "all available legal
remedies" against Plitt if the sale isn't completed.
   Plitt officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   On the stock market, news of the Plitt transaction
overshadowed the release by Cineplex of slightly more bullish
second-quarter earnings. While the company reported a net
loss of $38.4 million, or 81 cents a share, in the second
quarter of 1990, practically unchanged from $38.7 million, or
81 cents a share, the year before, admissions revenue rose as
did profit from operations before an $18.1 million charge
related to assets being held for disposal.
   Some analysts said "substantial" improvements in reducing
the company's debt and overhead have prompted them to
consider revising recommendations on the stock from a "sell"
to a "hold."
   "This is really very good progress, the turnaround is
coming," said Warburg's Ms. Barron.
