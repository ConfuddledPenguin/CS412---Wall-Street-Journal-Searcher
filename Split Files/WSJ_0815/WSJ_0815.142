   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said it
will lay off as many as 300 employees from its space-shuttle
production and assembly facilities in Downey and Palmdale,
Calif., by Sept. 30.
   The layoffs come as production work on the Endeavour
shuttle orbiter program is winding down, a Rockwell spokesman
said.
