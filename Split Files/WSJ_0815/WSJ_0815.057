   NEW YORK -- Texaco Inc. said it struck an agreement with
the Soviet Union that could give the company access to some
of that country's most promising oil reserves, possibly
within a few years.
   Texaco officials expect to begin almost immediately a
feasibility study defining joint production possibilities.
The study will focus on the Timan-Pechora region, which
encompasses a number of potential oilfields straddling the
Arctic Circle. Reserves there are estimated at about five
billion barrels of oil. On that basis, the region could equal
many of the huge fields that make up North Sea oil
production, industry experts estimate.

   In addition, Texaco officials said they were negotiating
to secure opportunities in the refining and marketing sector
of Soviet business. An agreement hasn't yet been reached, and
Texaco wouldn't elaborate.
   "This is a significant opportunity; we need each other,"
said Harold Zimmerman, Texaco general manager of exploration
and production who has taken part in the negotiations with
the Soviet Union.
   In light of the oil crisis in the Persian Gulf region, "it
offers potential for another supply of crude," he said.
"Under one production scheme the field could yield oil by
early 1992 or 1993."
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of oil,
with output currently around 12 million barrels a day.
Because of its weakening economy, however, the country has
had trouble properly maintaining its existing oil fields and
hasn't had financial resources to develop what are believed
to be vast amounts of undiscovered oil and natural gas. If
the Soviet Union can attract foreign investment to help
improve production, it also may be able to raise more badly
needed hard currency through oil exports.
   Texaco joins a growing list of major oil companies seeking
opportunities in the Soviet Union. Chevron Corp. and Elf
Aquitaine, the French petroleum company, both recently
concluded agreements granting them exploration and production
rights. Many other oil companies are in negotiations,
including British Petroleum Co.
   Texaco claimed its agreement with the Soviets is
especially broad, encompassing a larger initial geographical
area than those being explored by other oil companies and
allowing for study of potential operations in other regions.
   Texaco said no money has changed hands; a production
agreement is being negotiated. As a result, the company said
it isn't certain yet how much it may actually spend in the
Soviet Union. The company said those negotiations will run
concurrently with the drilling feasibility study about to
begin. Texaco officials expect the study to take about nine
months, and if that is successful, they believe they could
almost immediately set a drilling and production schedule.
   "The Timan-Pechora region holds significant potential for
early production," said Paul B. Hicks Jr., president of
Texaco Europe.
   As part of the overall agreement, Texaco will cooperate on
geological research with the Soviet Ministry of Geology,
including the supplying and installing computer facilities at
the ministry's Moscow offices. Texaco will also help train
Soviet personnel.
   In advance of yesterday's agreement, Soviet oil officials
have spent several weeks in Texaco offices in Houston and at
the company's Harrison, N.Y., headquarters. In Houston, the
Soviets examined computer facilities. In Harrison, the
director general of the ministry and others engaged in a
two-week business seminar. "Basically they were learning
Western business ways -- the basic financials of running an
oil business," said Mr. Zimmerman.
   Texaco began its quest in the Soviet Union by purchasing
four of six geological data packages offered by a London
broker licensed by the Soviet Union to sell such information
on its oil regions. Texaco paid about $750,000 for each
package. Packages are still being offered and Texaco
officials estimated they now go for $1 million each.
   Although acquiring access to Soviet oil is desirable, it
can be "frustrating," said Mr. Zimmerman. Talks "don't unfold
like they do in Western negotiations; there's a lot more
bureaucracy. There are problems knowing who in the Soviet
government has control over what resources."
   Texaco decided to center its exploration on potential oil
fields west of the Ural mountains. Company officials said
that better infrastructure exists there and with it chances
for earlier production. The eastern sectors were considered
too remote.
