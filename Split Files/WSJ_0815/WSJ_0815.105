   MEM Co. -- This New York-based marketer of fragrances said
it will omit its five-cent quarterly dividend in the third
quarter. The company said it is experiencing a liquidity
shortage. MEM has $16 million in bank debt, and is seeking to
borrow an additional $10 million to finance its business
during the Christmas selling season. Earlier this year, it
reduced its quarterly dividend to five cents from 10 cents.
