   NEW YORK -- Many growth-stock managers have taken the
recent market sell-off as a chance to buy stocks that
previously traded at lavish multiples of earnings. Not Foster
Friess.
   He has jacked up the cash holdings of the mutual fund he
manages, the $250 million Brandywine Fund, to more than 60%
of assets. "I'm willing to have egg on my face . . . to avoid
the risk that this is going to be something nasty," says Mr.
Friess.

   Mr. Friess's anxiety is noteworthy because he has a good
long-term track record. He is ranked by CDA Investment
Technologies as the country's second best money manager for
the five years ended June 30, with an annualized total return
of 23.7%, compared with 17.3% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stocks.
   And there's no question that he's unusually nervous. Mr.
Friess has gone heavily into cash just three times in his
long investment career. Right now is one of those times.
   "The market is saying that {the Middle East crisis} will
blow over and that there won't be a military conflagration,"
says 50 year-old Mr. Friess, whose money-management firm is
based in Greenville, Del. "I sure hope that happens, but I
still want to be cautious."
   Such a radical move into cash is unusual for any money
manager, but particularly for a growth-stock picker. Many
growth-stock managers remain fully invested in stocks at all
times, and some now wish they had even more cash to put to
work in the stock market.
   "I just think it's a heck of an opportunity," says
Pasadena Growth Fund's Roger Engemann. "Pretty soon people
will get bored with the blockade, because it's like watching
grass grow. They'll start concentrating on other things, and
one of the things they'll look at are growth stocks."
   G. Kenneth Heebner's top performing New England Growth
Fund went into the August sell-off fully invested in stocks,
and he plans to keep the fund that way. "There are a lot of
stocks out there for which this is a buying opportunity,"
says Mr. Heebner. He likes the drug stocks, some medical
product companies and the oil service companies.
   For his part, Mr. Friess says he hopes that he is wrong.
"I'll be very happy if the people I sold stock to make a lot
of money," he says.
   Mr. Friess made the decision to raise cash Aug. 3, the day
after Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait. It took Mr. Friess
and his team of portfolio managers just 20 minutes to reach
the decision. "We sat here in my office and talked about the
pluses or minuses," says Mr. Friess. "We felt this was the
best decision for our clients."
   On that Friday, Friess Associates Inc., which manages $1
billion in its mutual fund and in private accounts, sold
stock valued at close to $250 million. Over the next three
business days, the firm continued to sell heavily as the
stock market first tanked and then recovered modestly.
   Mr. Friess says it wasn't just the Middle East crisis that
prompted his flight to cash. On Aug. 2, the day before he
started selling, he had been in Washington, D.C., for a
meeting of the U.S. Senatorial Trust, an exclusive group of
Republican Party backers who occasionally meet with key
government officials.
   He came away from the meeting convinced that, because of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it would now be tougher than
ever to meet this year's budget-deficit reduction target.
Boosting gasoline taxes and slashing the military budget had
been widely discussed as ways of paring the deficit. But
following Iraq's invasion and the jump in oil prices, Mr.
Friess thinks both options may be dead.
   "There are very few stocks that we didn't sell some of,"
says Mr. Friess. But he has held on to a large part of his
position in such stocks as Adolph Coors, Sun Microsystems
Inc., Novell Inc., SynOptics Communications Inc., Stewart &amp;
Stevenson Services Inc., United HealthCare Corp., U.S.
Healthcare Inc., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., Biomet Inc. and
St. Jude Medical Inc. "They have things going for them that
won't be impacted as much by Iraq and things happening in the
budget area," he says.
   For Mr. Friess, holding more than the smallest amount of
cash is a rarity. He generally remains fully invested in the
stocks of companies that are enjoying rapid earnings and
sales growth. Last year, the no-load Brandywine Fund surged
33% on the backs of such highflying stocks as L.A. Gear and
Nike. The fund requires a $25,000 minimum investment.
   Only twice before has Mr. Friess gone heavily into cash,
in 1973 following the imposition of the Arab oil embargo and
in 1979, after the Shah of Iran was toppled. The first move
to cash paid off handsomely; the second move didn't.
   For now, the normally aggressive Mr. Friess is left to
count his cash and wait patiently for events in the Middle
East to play themselves out. "So what if we're on the
sidelines and we underperform for the next quarter or the
next two quarters?" he says. "I'm going to be in this
business for the next 40 quarters or 80 quarters."
