   "To rebuild and run the Hungarian business in which we are
buying a 49% stake," reports the CEO of a Western
consumer-goods company, "we'll need a dozen experienced
Hungarian executives. We had over a hundred applicants, each
appearing well qualified by job title and position. But only
three or four turned out to have the experience and skills
needed."
   Businesses in Central Europe seem to employ at least twice
as many managers and professionals as do comparable
businesses in the West. But there is an extreme scarcity of
managerial skills and experience.

   Many Central European managers have received excellent
educations: Central Europe's technical schools have
maintained high standards. But then these people spent their
working lives as paperpushers -- writing regulations or
endless reports or negotiating with the ministry and the
central planners about quotas, production targets, overhead
allocation, prices. Or they made their careers as "fixers":
chasing promised parts that hadn't arrived; scurrying to find
a few extra tons of materials, a little extra food for their
workers or foreign exchange to pay for a machine tool from
abroad.
   In fact, the abler a person was, the more likely he or she
was to be shifted into paperpushing or fixing, and kept
there. The skills needed to make a business perform are not
in great demand in a Stalinist economy. Stalinism knows
record keeping but not cost analysis or cost accounting.
Financial management of any kind is totally absent. But so
are pricing, market research, marketing, product innovation,
product and customer service, quality control. No major
design work on either one of East Germany's two automobiles,
the Trabant and the Wartburg, has been done since the
mid-1960s, 25 years ago.
   Indeed people with experience and skills are so scarce
that Commerzbank, third-largest of West Germany's big banks,
is not even trying to find East Germans for the branches it
is putting into every sizable East German town. It is
staffing them with West German employees who will commute for
18 months or two years until their East German replacements
have been trained. "Our new East German customers expect
competent service," explains one of Commerzbank's top people,
"and that requires a seasoned banker."
   Even two years' training, I suspect, isn't going to
produce an executive seasoned enough to run a regional
banking center in a big industrial city like Leipzig. But
skills can be taught and can be learned. There is furious
skill-learning going on all over Central Europe. Hungary for
instance, has opened an executive management center in
Budapest -- that teaches in English] Skills can sometimes
also be supplied from the outside. The scarcity of people in
Eastern Europe with the needed managerial and professional
skills is a very big problem. But it should be surmountable,
over time at least.
   Infinitely more difficult but also infinitely more
critical will be the needed revolution in the managerial
culture of Central Europe. It means undoing 40 years of wrong
values, wrong incentives and wrong policies.
   For 40 years no one in a Stalinist country has been
permitted to report the truth. An old Soviet story -- going
back to the early years of the Five Year Plans 60 years ago
-- tells of the plant manager who needed an accountant. He
asked each applicant: "How much is two and two?" He gave the
job to the one who answered: "How much do you need it to be,
Comrade Manager?"
   And that's still the right answer, despite "glasnost" and
"perestroika". There is no other explanation for the
near-famine in the Soviet Union today than that last fall's
glowing reports of record harvests were what Moscow "needed
them to be." And the regimes of Central Europe, especially
the hard-liners in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, were even
more economically Stalinist than the Russians, and stayed
Stalinist longer. How can people now be expected to tell the
truth when no one has been able to make a career for 40 years
unless he was willing to lie and to be lied to? But a
functioning economy is based on reliable information and on
reports that can be trusted.
   In a Stalinist system decisions are made at the highest
possible level. This is the essence of a "Plan" (and, of
course, a main reason why centralized planning did not work).
What to make and how much, what the product should look like
and how much it should cost, are all laid down in the Plan.
But so also is the number of people employed, their pay and
their bonuses, their job titles and their promotions. All
this is decided on high with minimum or no input from the
people who then are supposed to carry out the Plan. These
people can sabotage the Plan -- and they do. But they cannot
decide.
   As a result no one is in the habit of decision-making,
trained in it, tested in it. Nothing so much frightens people
in former Communist countries, visitors report, as to be
asked to make a decision. They are paralyzed by the fear of
making a mistake. They hold endless meetings, call for more
and more studies and in the end find a good reason why
someone higher up should take the responsibility. Yet it is
the essence of a market economy -- and its strength -- that
decisions are made close to market and customer, all the way
down to the salesman who decides whether to stop calling on
an unreceptive prospect, and to the supervisor who decides
whether to stop the line to correct a malfunction. This is
almost inconceivable to people who have lived and worked 40
years under a Stalinist regime.
   Central Europe desperately needs middle-sized enterprises.
The greatest opportunities, especially for providing badly
needed new jobs, lie in services and in consumer goods. These
are both areas in which middle-sized, locally managed
businesses flourish. The bankrupt, giant government
businesses can in most cases be salvaged only if broken up
into smaller and more manageable units. If instead they are
"privatized" as they are -- as now strongly advocated by
government people in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland
-- they will simply shift from being unproductive government
monopolies to being unproductive non-government monopolies.
And there would then be no economic turn-around, no
free-market economy, only continued economic stagnation.
   But where will the people come from to manage middle-sized
enterprises? Stalinism can tolerate a farm woman's selling a
few apples off a push cart. It cannot and does not tolerate
middle-sized enterprises. To be effectively controlled,
enterprises must be big and super-big. There is the huge
ministry, employing tens of thousands which centrally runs
all of the country's machine-tool factories. There is the
"Kombinat," only slightly smaller, the large holding company
which centrally runs all the country's clothing factories.
And then there are large conglomerates for which Stalinism
has special affection. The former Bata shoe factory in Zlin
in Central Czechoslovakia -- until World War II the world's
most efficient and most profitable footwear manufacturer --
still makes shoes. But it now also includes a dozen totally
unrelated businesses, including machinery manufacturers and
even an airplane maker.
   Sixty years ago Central Europe was chock-full of the kind
of firms, the Germans call "Mittelstand," that is, successful
middle-sized businesses, usually family-owned and
family-managed. But only a few old people at or past
retirement age even remember them now. The last ones in East
Germany were expropriated more than 30 years ago; in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, as well as Poland, they were gone
10 years earlier.
   And even if the needed entrepreneurs were to emerge, would
they be allowed to do their work? After 40 years of Stalinist
indoctrination there is deep prejudice against such people.
That they try to make a profit is bad enough. Worse, much
worse, they are independent. And for 40 years independent
people have been virtual outlaws, "They all want capitalism,"
said a Belgian Mittelstand industrialist who had just come
back from a long trip to Hungary and East Germany. "But they
don't want capitalists; they want functionaries."
   There is, finally, an even bigger problem of managerial
culture than any discussed so far: the lack of understanding
of what free enterprise and a market economy are all about.
   An American marketing executive this spring visited the
Czech provincial city in which she had been born and raised
and which she left, 22 years ago, fresh out of college, when
the Russian tanks crushed the "Prague Spring" in 1968. "I was
immediately asked," she reports, "to hold a seminar on
marketing for the top people in the city's five big
factories. I started out by telling them how our company in
the U.S. operates. We have 2500 employees and are number
three in a small but highly competitive and fast-moving
market. I soon realized that I made no sense to my audience.
   "So I stopped and said: `I have the feeling that you
define a competitive market as one in which prices are kept
high enough for every competitor to make a good profit.'
   "`That's exactly right,' they all said. `After all, in a
market economy a business has to make a profit.'
   "`No,' I said, `in a market economy it has to earn a
profit.' And there was a look of utter bewilderment on every
face."
   Very few, if any, people in Central Europe still believe
in communism as a political, a social, an economic or a moral
system. They want political freedom. They want the incomes
and the goods that they know only a market economy can
provide. But do they yet know -- and how could they possibly
know? -- that in a market economy there is no "profit" but
only "profit and loss"; no "reward," but only "risk and
reward"; and that freedom is not just the absence of
restraint but self-discipline and responsibility?
