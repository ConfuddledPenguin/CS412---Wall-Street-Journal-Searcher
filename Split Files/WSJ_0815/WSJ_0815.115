   OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc. said it completed the purchase
of Beatrice Co. from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for $1.34
billion in cash and stock.
   ConAgra said the acquisition, which solidifies its
position as the nation's second largest food processor,
wasn't challenged by the Federal Trade Commission after a
two-month review. Antitrust regulators had requested
additional information about the pact last month.
