   WASHINGTON -- Even before vaulting oil prices rattled
consumers, retail sales were barely growing, government
statistics show.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales inched
up 0.1% in July after rising 1.1% in June and falling the
three previous months. Car, clothing, restaurant and filling
station sales all declined last month; sales grew at
furniture, hardware, drug and general-merchandise stores.

   The big question now is whether the jump in gasoline and
other energy costs provoked by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
will lead consumers to curb spending in other areas. If they
do, one of the most powerful engines driving the 7 1/2-year
economic expansion, already sputtering, will have stalled.
   "I'm relatively pessimistic," said Aubrey Zaffuto, an
economist at IBJ Schroeder Bank &amp; Trust Co. in New York. The
latest sales report, she said, "is consistent with a consumer
probably overburdened with debt, hoping interest rates were
going to go down" but haven't, and who "now will be pinched
further by rising oil prices."
   Retail sales amount to about half of U.S. consumer
spending, which in turn accounts for two thirds of the
nation's economic activity.
   "The recent rise in oil prices threatens to keep retail
sales growth down in coming months," said Richard Rahn, chief
economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Consumers will
spend more on petroleum products, leaving them with less
money to spend on other products."
   Moreover, the figures aren't adjusted for inflation, and
so far this year retail sales haven't kept pace with rising
prices. "When adjusted for inflation," Mr. Rahn forecast,
"consumer spending will continue to fall for the rest of
1990."
   In the bond market, however, many traders focused on the
May and June sales numbers, which the department revised
upward from preliminary figures. The traders took the
alterations as an indication that the economy hasn't been as
weak as many analysts believed. The 1.1% increase in June
sales was significantly higher than the Commerce Department's
earlier calculation of a 0.5% rise. And after reviewing new
data, the department said retail sales slipped only 0.1% in
May instead of the 0.6% it estimated earlier.
   The retail sales figures are based on a relatively small
sample of reports and frequently are revised as more
information comes in. The numbers exclude spending on
services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer
outlays.
   Frederick Sturm, senior economist at Fuji Securities in
Chicago, said the revisions and the slim July sales gain
"don't change our mind about the behavior of the
macroeconomy. Essentially, the economy is stumbling along. We
don't think that it's actually going to collapse into
recession."
   Whether or not the economy steers clear of a downturn
depends on the Federal Reserve, many economists believe. The
central bank is caught in a particularly delicate situation.
Bush administration officials believe Fed policy makers
should push down interest rates in order to stimulate the
flagging economy and save it from recession. But Fed
officials are wary of easing their grip on credit in the face
of mounting inflation prompted by the oil price rise.
   Overall retail sales totaled $149.51 billion in July, the
Commerce Department said. Car sales fell 0.6%. Sales of
home-related products were surprisingly strong, baffling many
economists who expected continued weakness because of the
troubled real estate markets in many regions of the country.
Furniture sales rose 2.5%, while sales of building materials
and hardware jumped 3.9%. Most economists said they expected
those figures to be revised downward after more data come in.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
