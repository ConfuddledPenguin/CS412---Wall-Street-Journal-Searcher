   ST. LOUIS, Mo. -- Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. said it
adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at protecting
stockholders from "coercive and unfair takeover tactics by a
hostile acquirer."
   The bank holding company said it isn't aware of any
takeover attempt targeting Boatmen's, but considered adoption
of the plan "prudent" in light of the "uncertainty of the
recent takeover environment in the banking industry."

   Under the plan, shareholders will on Aug. 31 be issued
rights that, under certain hostile-takeover circumstances,
permit the holder to buy stock in the company at half-price.
