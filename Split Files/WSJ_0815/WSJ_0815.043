   NEW YORK -- Edgell Communications Inc., the former unit of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. taken private in a management
buy-out in 1987, has offered its bondholders and creditors a
plan to restructure debt payments.
   The exchange offer from New Century Communications Inc.,
the New York-based parent holding company of Edgell
Communications, follows a deteriorating situation at the
publishing and trade show company. Founder Robert Edgell
unexpectedly resigned in March as chief executive. And the
company did not make a $7 million interest payment to
bondholders on July 16.

   Cleveland-based Edgell, one of the country's largest trade
magazine publishers and a growing force in the trade
exposition field, continues to operate with substantial
profit margins, Edgell executives said. But revenue from
magazines and trade shows have not grown as expected, and the
company can't keep up with interest payments.
   Richard B. Swank, the recently appointed chief executive
officer of Edgell, said that as part of the restructuring
plan, as many as eight Edgell magazines have been pegged for
sale.
   Edgell Communications was formed in 1987, when Mr. Edgell
led management in a $334.1 million leveraged buy-out of the
business publications and school supplies unit of Harcourt
Brace. The buy-out was financed by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a
unit of General Electric Co., and General Electric Capital
Corp., another GE unit, which remains the majority owner of
Edgell. Traditionally profitable but unglamorous, Edgell's
trade magazines include Urology Times, Pipeline &amp; Gas
Journal, and Food Management, as well as 52 other titles.
   In the exchange offer made last week, Edgell is proposing
a change in the amortization schedule on a $185 million loan
from General Electric Credit Corp. Edgell is asking that
interest payments on the loan be delayed and spread out over
a period of time. Edgell is also proposing that institutions
that own about $100 million in high-yield junk bonds exchange
their bonds for equity in the company. Edgell's buy-out was
also backed by $5 million from private investors, as well as
about $8 million in cash and $45 million in preferred shares
from Kidder, Peabody.
   The deadline for the exchange offer is Aug. 30. Neither
Kidder nor General Electric would comment on the exchange
offers.
   Edgell is still a "good company," Mr. Swank said, which he
claimed has operating profit margins of more than 20% in
magazines and more than 35% in the trade show business.
