   Tokyo stock prices finished higher Tuesday, a day after
the market had one of its biggest setbacks since the
beginning of this year. Shares extended late-morning gains
during the afternoon on widespread perception that both
stocks and futures were oversold.
   London shares closed higher on bargain-hunting in issues
thought to be oversold.

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up
496.10 points at 26672.53. The index plunged 1153.12 points,
or 4.22%, Monday.
   At midmorning Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was up
911.19 points to 27583.72.
   Tuesday's volume on the First Section was 380 million
shares, up from Monday's 267.5 million.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 584 to 337,
while 130 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which plunged 63.84 points Monday, was
up 27.29 points, or 1.37%, at 2020.33.
   The Second Section index, which plummeted 123.75 points
Monday, was up 7.00 points, or 0.18%, to close at 3995.36.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at nine million
shares, up from 7.2 million Monday.
   "If New York {stocks} had fallen yesterday {Monday}, Tokyo
wouldn't have ended this way," said Yoshihiro Ito, general
manager of stock trading at Okasan Securities. "This market
is moving according only to investor psychology at the
moment," he said.
   The market advanced strongly right after the open,
reflecting relief of many investors who had feared Monday's
plunge in Tokyo might prompt a sell-off on Wall Street,
traders said.
   The Nikkei index fell 600 points to 25949 points at
midmorning, however, under pressure of arbitrage selling as
futures indexes declined.
   Then, as the index fell below 26000 points,
bargain-hunting buy orders by dealers, some institutions and
corporations, targeted at oversold large-capital shares,
gradually pushed up stock prices.
   "There was frequent talk among brokerage houses and
investors in the afternoon that the market must have hit near
bottom," said a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.
   In response to the recovery of the cash market,
institutions that had been selling futures for short hedges
bought back futures. Higher futures indexes in turn
encouraged further buying on the spot market, traders said.
   Observers saw Tuesday's gain as a technical rebound after
Monday's sharp plunge and predicted that a continual sharp
rebound is unlikely.
   "Stock prices fell with no specific reason yesterday. They
went up without any good news today," said Hiroyuki Murai,
general manager of stock trading at Nikko Securities.
   Kimitoshi Hasegawa, head of Separate Account Management at
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, said, "The market absorbed the possible
impact of the Iraqi problem last week. Monday's loss should
be explained by the market's internal factors."
   Nippon Steel advanced 28 yen (19 cents) to 538 yen,
becoming the most heavily traded stock for the day. NKK was
up 25 to 528.
   Among shipbuilding companies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
advanced 17 to 830, while IHI gained 18 to 830.
   Gold mining companies were bought on rising gold prices on
the world market as investors hedge inflationary risks caused
by the higher oil prices prompted by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   Sumitomo Metal Mining gained 60 to 1,600. Mitsubishi
Mining rose 29 to 670.
   London shares finished higher Tuesday. Internationals were
particularly cheered by the stronger pound, dealers said.
   But dealers said they were keeping a close eye on Wall
Street and even more so on unfolding developments in the
Middle East. Trading was described as sparse and lacking in
incentive.
   Stocks were also buoyed by earnings news from Hanson,
Britain's largest industrial conglomerate, which announced a
26% rise in pretax profit for its latest nine months, ended
June 30. The earnings arrived at the top end of market
expectations and were helped by first-time contributions from
the acquisition of Consolidated Gold Fields. Hanson gained
6.5 pence to 215.5 pence in heavy trading.
   At the closing bell, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 14.5 points at 2234.0. The
index reached its intraday high in the first hour of official
trading when it was up 22.6 at 2242.1, while hitting its
intraday minimum of 2224.0 at the start of trading.
   The narrower FT 30-share index finished up 10.4 points at
1742.6. Turnover amounted to a scant 330.9 million shares,
compared with 294.3 million Monday.
   In the futures market, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract finished the session at 2250.0, up from 2238.0
Monday.
   U.K. industrial production figures released yesterday had
little impact on a market in which many investors had closed
their positions to take summer holidays, dealers said.
   Among corporate features, Lonrho, with large gold mining
and refining interests, rose 6 to 268. The stock was buoyed
by a sharp move higher in the spot bullion price as investors
flee into the yellow metal on a perception as a "safe haven"
in times of international crisis. Gold was set at $411.50 an
ounce at the late London gold fixing Tuesday, up from $404.30
Monday.
   Among oils, British Petroleum rose 4.5 to 363.5, Shell
advanced 5 to 484 and Enterprise rose a penny to 670.
   Domestic issues were hampered by opinions that U.K.
interest rates would have to remain high for some time to
come because of the inflationary costs that higher oil prices
will bring to the U.K. economy.
   Dealers said Reuters rose after being sharply oversold in
recent weeks. The stock ended 18 higher at #10.04 ($18.90).
Anglo-Dutch food and household products group Unilever
advanced 10 to 664 on strong volume of 2.1 million shares.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich
and Madrid, lower in Paris, Brussels and Milan, mixed in
Amsterdam and flat in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Prices closed higher in Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Manila
and Singapore, and lower in Wellington and Seoul.
