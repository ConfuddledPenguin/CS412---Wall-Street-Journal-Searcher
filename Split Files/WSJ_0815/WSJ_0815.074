   DANBURY, Conn. -- First Brands Corp. reported that
increased sales of its plastic bags and automotive care
products pushed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings sharply
higher, and may improve results in the next fiscal year.
   First Brands, which said that it is continuing to solicit
bids for a sale of the company, reported earnings of $4.4
million, or 20 cents per share, for the quarter ended June
30, up from $863,000, or four cents per share, in the
year-earlier period.

   The company's total fourth-quarter sales, however, were
down to $248 million, from $273.3 million a year earlier.
   First Brands, which was created by a 1986 leveraged buyout
of several businesses from the Union Carbide Corp., said that
strong sales of its Glad plastic bags and wraps and its STP
automotive additives more than offset lagging sales of its
Prestone antifreeze.
   The company's chief financial officer, Donald DeSantis,
explained that antifreeze prices had fallen since an earlier
shortage of a petrochemical ingredient had eased.
   The company's Glad and STP brand products, however, have
been increasing in unit volume, sales and profitability, he
said.
   In late June, the controlling shareholders of First Brands
announced that they were seeking a buyer for all or part of
the company.
   "The process of soliciting bids to purchase the company is
continuing, and several parties have expressed an interest,"
said Alfred E. Dudley, the company's chairman, chief
executive officer, and president, in a prepared statement.
   For the fiscal year, earnings were $49.6 million, or $2.40
per share, down from $61.0 million, or $3.03 per share, in
fiscal 1989. Total sales were $1.01 billion in 1990, down
from $1.21 billion in 1989.
   The 1989 results, however, were inflated by a $15.5
million gain from the sale of the company's
household-products business in Europe. In addition, 1990
earnings were hurt by a $786,000 charge related to the
repurchase of senior subordinated debt.
