   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- In early 1988, Vietnamese toughs
began to show up in Suying Cantrelle's general store here and
"walk around like they were big bosses," the store owner
recalls. They demanded money, at one point asking for $100 a
day, and threatened to kill her brother if she didn't comply,
the former Saigon resident adds.
   But Mrs. Cantrelle, who at at five foot one and 85 pounds
looks barely strong enough to stand up against a good breeze,
didn't intend to back down. "We have a responsibility to
clean up our community," she says. "If we keep quiet, things
are just going to get worse."
   Instead of paying, she went to the police and pushed
reluctant witnesses to step forward. Three men were
eventually arrested. Though authorities couldn't gather
enough evidence to win extortion convictions, the defendants
were found guilty in a state court here of assault and
weapons charges. "Without Suying there wouldn't have been a
case," says Steven Harrold, the deputy district attorney who
prosecuted the case. "She's a very brave lady."
   The alleged shakedown of Mrs. Cantrelle's business is an
all-too-familiar tale for entrepreneurs, who are often
victims of the rise in crime. Resisting criminals is hard --
and scary.
   Immigrant entrepreneurs such as Mrs. Cantrelle are often
especially vulnerable. Law-enforcement officials say they
believe extortion against Asian businesses is widespread. But
victims, often fearful of retribution, unable to speak
English well and harboring a distrust of the police that was
ingrained in their homelands, rarely report the crime, the
officials say.
   The dangers range from street gangs that terrorize Asian
communities to more sophisticated groups such as the Wah
Ching. A one-time Chinese youth gang, the Wah Ching has
turned into a "significant organized criminal group" with
nationwide operations in everything from narcotics
trafficking and murder to extortion and loansharking,
according to a 1989 report by the federal General Accounting
Office.
   At the Cantrelle trial, an acknowledged Wah Ching member
admitted to taking part in the beating of a vendor at Mrs.
Cantrelle's store. He also told of extorting money from Asian
businesses in San Francisco and coming to Sacramento looking
for new victims. However, he denied making any extortion
attempts against Mrs. Cantrelle's business and said the
beating stemmed from a personal dispute.
   The testimony of Vi Khuu, the vendor who was beaten, shows
how difficult it can be for a small business owner such as
Mrs. Cantrelle to buck the tide and fight such gangs. Mr.
Khuu testified that in Vietnam suspected criminals could
bribe their way out of custody and go after their victims
again. Mr. Khuu, who runs a jewelry counter in Mrs.
Cantrelle's store, said he was afraid the same thing would
happen in the U.S.
   What nudged Mr. Khuu and others to testify was the
perseverance of Mrs. Cantrelle. As the problem unfolded,
"there were a lot of late-night sessions at people's homes
where she convinced them they had to talk," recalls Mrs.
Cantrelle's husband, Joseph. Mr. Harrold says there were
points in the case where he was sure some of the witnesses
would have backed out if not for Mrs. Cantrelle. "She was a
very strong victim," adds Darrell Fong, the Sacramento police
detective who investigated the case.
   Mrs. Cantrelle, who came to Sacramento from Vietnam in
1974, has long been an activist. For years, she worked for
social-service organizations. In her spare time, she has
raised money for local families in need and acted as an
interpreter for them with government agencies.
   She says she started the Vinh Phat Market in 1984 largely
as a way to employ the increasing number of family members
coming into the Sacramento area. The one-story building of
stucco and corrugated metal is part food store, part emporium
and part art mart. Live catfish and 50-pound bags of rice
share space with racks of rumpled suits, piles of shoes and
brightly colored oriental statues. She presides over it all
from a windowless back office crammed with boxes of beauty
cream, cigarettes and other inventory.
   Shortly after the money demands began in 1988, Mr. Khuu
was marched out from behind his jewelry counter at gunpoint
and beaten in the parking lot. He testified that the next day
he received a telephone call demanding $3,000. "He was beaten
as an example to show they meant business," says Mr. Harrold.
   At the trial, Mr. Khuu testified he didn't return to work
for three weeks out of fear for his safety. And Mrs.
Cantrelle's brother testified he was told that if money
wasn't forthcoming, he should "be prepared to buy a coffin."
The defense contended that any dispute was due to money owed
the defendants by Mrs. Cantrelle's family, an assertion she
heatedly denied.
   Several weeks after Mr. Khuu's beating, there was a
shootout at the market between two of the defendants and a
local gambler. Though nobody was hurt, Mrs. Cantrelle says
that helped convince remaining doubters of the need to
cooperate with the police.
   After she went to the police, Mrs. Cantrelle says she
walked out of Vinh Phat one evening to find four men in a car
pointing a camera at her. Suspecting the worst, she hopped in
her car and gave chase.
   She wheeled her car in front of theirs at a red light,
blocking them along with most of the intersection. She
marched over, demanding the camera. "I figured they wouldn't
kill me with everyone else around," she says. But the men
managed to slip their car around hers and get away.
   After all this, "Suying has become a kind of cult heroine"
in the immigrant community in Sacramento, says Philip
Isenberg, a state assemblyman who sponsored a legislative
commendation for Mrs. Cantrelle as an immigrant who resisted
gang wrongdoing. He also recently had her testify in support
of a bill to set up a statewide hotline for immigrants to
phone in anonymous tips on criminal activities.
   Mrs. Cantrelle is upset that more of her fellow Asian
business owners aren't speaking up as she has. She believes
many are being shaken down and silently paying. "If they are
being robbed, I don't feel sorry for them," she says. "They
haven't stood up."
