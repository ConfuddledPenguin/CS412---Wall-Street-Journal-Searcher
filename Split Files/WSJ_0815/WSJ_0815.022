   Your July 25 page-one story regarding the self-delusion
home sellers are inflicting upon themselves serves as a
lesson for many in today's post-boom marketplace.
   An unrealistic price set for a home only points to the
seller's naivete and the broker's unwillingness to do his
job: counsel the client to recognize what the market will
bear. The worst advice is to set a high price "and see what
happens." What usually occurs -- as evidenced by the case
study of the folks in Rye, N.Y. -- is that the property
doesn't sell, the asking price is continually "adjusted," all
parties involved get fed up and, worse, the property is
stigmatized. Who wants to admit to buying something that's
been knocked around and passed up by half the world?

   An owner has the privilege of setting any price he wishes.
But it's important to measure the benefits of a lower price
that may lead to a quick sale and lessen the risk that the
property will become corrupted by an unrealistic view of what
the true value is. It's never been more appropriate to return
to the time-honored rule that "it's only worth what someone
will pay for it."
