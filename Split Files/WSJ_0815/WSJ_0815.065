   NEW YORK -- Are investors fighting the last war?
   In the past week's tumult, investors have favored the same
sectors of the stock market that did well during the 1970s
oil-price shocks and pummeled most of the same losers,
according to Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., investment research
firm.

   But a minority of investment strategists say that the
market may have learned too well from the inflationary jolts
of 1973-74 and 1979-80. In particular, they suggest that
investors may be acting on expectations about inflation and
interest rates that aren't justified by the current limping
economy.
   The most obvious differences that set today apart, says
Richard Hoey, U.S. chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
is that "those two oil shocks came when the economy was
closer to boom levels" and inflation was already a problem.
The result in 1973-74 was "an inflation psychology that fed
on itself," as businesses stocked up inventories and
consumers spent like there was no tomorrow. In 1979-80, the
Federal Reserve fought back with a sudden and very aggressive
monetary tightening that sent interest rates into the
stratosphere.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, investors seem to be
betting that soaring inflation and interest rates are going
to be big problems again.
   For instance, in the market's roiling of recent days, gold
and oil-industry stocks -- the only reliable winners from the
inflation shocks of the 1970s -- have been virtually the only
sectors to advance. These sectors gained 3% to 8% in the
first 10 days of this month, according to Barra. That
compares with an average loss of about 6% for Barra's
1200-stock universe.
   But now, in contrast to the situation in the 1970s, credit
is relatively tight and the economy is showing signs of a
slump. That plus the fact that corporate, consumer and
government debt is much higher than it was in the 1970s leads
some analysts to argue that deflation, or falling prices,
poses a bigger threat to investors' wealth than inflation or
higher interest rates.
   For instance, fears about high debt and the general state
of the economy mean that "although oil will give a one-time
push to inflation, it won't be contagious this time," says
Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "I
think people will treat {higher oil prices} like an
involuntary tax on consumption -- they will reduce
consumption elsewhere, putting downward pressure on prices
generally."
   While fears of oil-spurred inflation sent bond prices
tumbling and interest rates rising in recent days, "that may
be an area where people are overreacting," says Barclays' Mr.
Hoey. "Because the economy has already crested, the major
effect {of the oil shock} will be downside on the economy,
rather than upside on interest rates."
   The main driver of oil prices now is "fear, concern, hope
or whatever that things will go further in the Middle East,"
says Richard Gordon, senior director of Petroleum Finance
Co., a Washington-based oil and gas consultants concern.
Meanwhile, investors seem content to overlook the fact that
the fundamentals of the oil market are "still pretty weak,"
he says.
   Mr. Gordon would be a long-term player in oils through
smaller independent oil companies such as Adobe Resources
Corp. and Noble Affiliates Inc., which have been "overlooked
so far in the rush to bigname companies," but he would
suggest taking some profits now in the "so-called quality
integrated companies" that have been among the market's
favorites.
   Meanwhile, even before their latest runup, gold stocks
were already anticipating a substantial rise in bullion
prices, says John Charles Potvin, senior precious metals
analyst at Burns Fry Ltd. And their recent gains have paced
bullion's own advance. At today's prices, Mr. Potvin would
still be a long-term buyer of Echo Bay Mines Ltd., American
Barrick Resources Corp. and Placer Dome Inc., but he classes
Homestake Mining Co. and Lac Minerals Ltd. as "expensive."
   Aside from the rush to oil and gold, some analysts suspect
the market might have overshot itself in the way investors
punished the potential big losers from the Iraqi fray. As a
result, those areas may offer good values now to
brave-hearted investors, some strategists say.
   For instance, life insurance stocks, which tend to rise
and fall on the asset value of their mostly fixed-income
investment portfolios, were among the hardest hit by the
latest replay of 1970s-style interest-rate fears.
   Transamerica Corp. is one stock that was "hit more than it
should have been" in recent days, says David Seifer, an
insurance analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities
Corp. Capital Holding Corp. and Torchmark Corp. also look
like good buys now, in his view.
   Other sectors where analysts say investors may have
overreacted to fears of rising rates include high dividend
stocks, such as electric utilities and telephones -- which
are normally the defensive investment of choice in bearish
times -- and interest-sensitive banks and thrifts.
   In contrast with the 1970s, "you're starting in the 1990s
with high real {inflation-adjusted} yields," Mr. Hoey says.
"If long rates stay high for a while, then drop in a
recession, high-yielding stocks will do fine."
   In the banking sector, Citicorp and Chemical Banking Corp.
"are now down to where they look interesting, at least on a
speculative basis," says Mr. Metz. While he doesn't like
cellular telephone plays, he says American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. "is a very interesting buy now, selling within
a dollar of its year's low."
   Electric utilities remain broadly attractive, in Mr.
Metz's view: "You've got three things working for you -- the
inflation fears have been overdone, the yields of these
stocks are high, and they are recession-resistant."
   Other depressed sectors that analysts say might be worth a
look today are the so-called double-whammy stocks -- such as
trucking, autos, airlines and container freight -- that not
only are very recession-sensitive but also are linked to
heavy use of oil.
   Many of those stocks were already selling at historically
low valuation levels on recession fears before the latest
sell-off began. And -- just as during previous oil-price
shocks -- they were battered even more by the latest
oil-induced sell-off.
   At current prices, several airline stocks look as cheap as
or cheaper than they were at the height of the 1979-80
oil-price surgeat least according to classic valuation
measures, such as comparing stock prices to earnings, book
value, sales and other company fundamentals, says George
Douglas, chairman of Dais Group Inc., a subsidiary of
Templeton Global Investors Inc.
   At today's prices, Delta Air Lines' price-to-book ratio is
"at a 10-year low relative to the market," he says. Delta's
price-to-cash-flow and price-to-sales are "not far from their
lows of 1985-86 and well below where they were in 1980," he
adds.
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, is similarly cheap
at a 60% discount to the market on a price-to-book basis, Mr.
Douglas says.
   Mr. Metz also feels that the market has "overdone it" in
trashing AMR and Delta. Among auto makers, Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp. also look "awfully attractive" at
current levels, in his view.
   But while these stocks may be battered down to bargain
levels, investors who are tempted to buy them now should
remember the crucial risk of value investing: The stocks
could stay undervalued for some time.
   Ford and Chrysler Corp. were "significantly undervalued"
before the latest oil-induced sell-off and then got "really,
really walloped," says Ann Knight, auto analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. "I'd say sitting on your hands is the best
course of action for now," she says. "I'm definitely not
saying bail out, but I'm not stepping up to them yet either."
