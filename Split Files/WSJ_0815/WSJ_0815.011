   CHICAGO -- The farm economy is taking a turn for the
worse, threatened by storm clouds over the Middle East and
good crop-growing weather elsewhere.
   Grain prices are dropping amid projections that harvests
this year will be unexpectedly large across much of the
world. Wheat analysts, for instance, already have increased
their forecasts by 440 million bushels, an amount akin to the
output of Kansas, the biggest U.S. wheat-producing state. As
a result, wheat prices are approaching the depressed levels
reached before the 1988 drought. In trading at the Chicago
Board of Trade yesterday, the wheat contract for September
delivery settled at $2.795.

   Production costs, though, are pointing upward. The Mideast
conflict is expected to raise the cost of fueling tractors
and combines for the fall harvests. The price of
nitrogen-based fertilizer, made from natural gas, also may be
higher by spring planting. The Agriculture Department
estimates that a $5-a-barrel jump in the price of oil
increases annual farm expenses by $900 million.
   At the same time, more economists are predicting
recession. A business downturn would almost certainly damp
consumer demand for beef and pork and bring meat prices down
from June's record levels at supermarkets. That in turn could
puncture the high prices farmers have been getting for their
cattle and hogs.
   "Farmers are facing a lot of whammies," said Raymond
Daniel, an economist at WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Still, farmers generally are in the best shape in more
than a decade to weather a downturn. Hefty government
payments have helped reduce their debts to reasonable levels.
The price of land, their biggest asset, has climbed for three
years and many farmers have been able to replace their worn
equipment. Few see any economic calamity ahead on the scale
of the farm crisis of the early 1980s.
   Yet, the change in direction for the farm economy has been
very sudden. In the spring, corn prices were rising steadily
while fuel prices were low. And while many economists
continue to expect net farm income this year to meet or beat
last year's record $49 billion, some see net farm income
declining next year by $2 billion or more.
   "The farm economy has been its most robust in close to a
decade," said Neil E. Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa
State University. "Since Iraq, we can look ahead to it being
less robust."
   That's because, among other things, rising oil prices
won't be a boost for U.S. farmers as they were in the 1970s.
Then, oil-producing nations such as the Soviet Union and the
Gulf nations used their petrodollars to buy U.S. crops.
   This time, economic sanctions imposed against Iraq are
wiping out the eighth-biggest market for wheat farmers. The
wheat Iraq purchased kept about 1.2 million acres of U.S.
land in production. Iraq also was the single biggest buyer of
U.S. rice. Kuwait is also effectively cut off from the U.S.
grain pipeline.
   Higher oil revenue would help the Soviet Union tackle its
credit problems with U.S. grain exporters. But bumper crops
there are widely expected to pare, perhaps drastically, its
demand for U.S. crops.
   Last week, the Agriculture Department forecast that the
Soviet Union will import from all sources 30 million metric
tons of grain for the 12-month period ending June 1991. That
figure would represent a 21% decline from the previous year,
and the lowest level in four years. Some private analysts
speculate that Soviet crop imports could drop as low as 25
million metric tons. In recent years, the U.S. has been the
largest supplier of grain to the Soviet Union.
   China's need for U.S. crops is also expected to drop in
the wake of good growing conditions there. If a recession
materializes in the U.S. and spreads world-wide, it would
probably depress buying by Pacific Basin countries.
Meanwhile, some of the toughest competitors of the U.S. in
the grain trade, such as Canada, are also preparing to reap
large harvests. "There's going to be a great deal more
competition," said Andrew Bellingham, a vice president at
World Perspectives Inc., a Washington-based agricultural
economics firm.
   Since 1986, U.S. corn exports have nearly doubled to about
2.4 billion bushels. But analysts foresee exports sinking
next year, from only slightly to as much as 12%. Furthermore,
the U.S. also appears to be on the verge of harvesting a
large corn crop -- its biggest since 1986.
   In the wake of all this, corn prices have plunged about 45
cents a bushel, or 15%, since Independence Day. The corn
contract for September delivery settled yesterday at the
Chicago Board of Trade at $2.455. In the spring, corn prices
climbed on fears that poor planting conditions would damage
the crop. Since then, growing conditions have been nearly
ideal although the crop is maturing late.
   Nearly the same picture applies to wheat. The U.S. wheat
harvest this year is expected to jump by one-third from last
year's crop, which was damaged by dry weather. But some
private analysts expect overseas demand for U.S. wheat
through May to drop as much as 8%. The upshot is that more
crops are going into stockpiles, which can depress prices
further as they swell.
   For consumers, weakening crop prices don't necessarily
translate into lower grocery prices. The companies that make
everything from cereal to bread probably will adjust their
prices to reflect higher energy costs.
   The impact of that probably won't be felt fully until next
year. Paul Prentice, chief economist at Farm Sector Economics
Associates, already has raised his food-inflation projection
for 1991 to 5.5% from an original estimate of 4.4%.
   There are some expected big winners from the grain-price
decline and the oil-price rise. U.S. fertilizer manufacturers
could get a chance to put some of their idled capacity into
production because Kuwait has stopped exporting nitrogen.
   The once-tottering ethanol industry might have its most
profitable year. Last summer, many plants that convert corn
to ethanol were losing money because corn prices were
climbing while oil prices were low. Ethanol prices tend to
follow gasoline prices. In the Chicago area, the price of a
gallon of ethanol since Iraq's military action has risen a
dime to about $1.35 a gallon.
