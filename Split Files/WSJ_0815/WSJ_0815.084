   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. -- Mission Resource Partners L.P.
said it plans to omit its second-quarter dividend as
second-quarter net fell 58% to $697,285, or 16 cents a share,
from a year earlier. Revenue fell 28% to $3.8 million.
   A year earlier, the company posted profit of $1.7 million,
or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $5.3 milllion.

   For the six months, profit fell to $1.5 million, or 35
cents a share, from $2 million, or 47 cents a share. Revenue
declined to $77.7 million from $8.6 million.
   The partnership, which has interests in oil and gas wells,
blamed the decline on "a significant drop in oil and gas
prices" earlier this year, as well as absence of revenue from
oil and gas properties sold during its earlier restructuring.
