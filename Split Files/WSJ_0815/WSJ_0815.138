   Southwest Gas Corp. posted a second-quarter net loss of
$6.1 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with net income

   The Las Vegas, Nev.-based natural gas and financial
services concern attributed the net loss to increased costs
associated with providing gas service to the company's
growing customer base; increased depreciation expense and
general taxes relating to natural gas pipe replacement
programs in Arizona; and costs for expanding and upgrading
facilities.
   Gas operations had a loss of $8.5 million for the quarter,
compared with a loss of $3.1 million a year ago. Operating
earnings from the company's financial services subsidiary,
PriMerit Bank, fell to $3.4 million in the quarter from $4.5
million a year ago, beacuse of a drop in real estate
development income and increased general and administrative
expenses due to the expansion of PriMerit's branch network in
Nevada and Arizona. This was offset by improved net interest
margins, the company said.
   For the six months, net income fell 33% to $15.3 million,
or 74 cents a share, from $22.9 million, or $1.16 a share.
Revenue rose less than one percent to $445.3 million from
$441.7 million.
