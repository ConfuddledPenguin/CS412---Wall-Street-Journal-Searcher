   WASHINGTON -- President Bush accused congressional
Democrats of reneging on a pledge to offer a
deficit-reduction plan and vowed to veto any spending bill
that "busts the budget."
   Mr. Bush, interrupting his Maine vacation for a day in
Washington, accused the Democratic-controlled Congress of "an
abdication of responsibility that endangers our economic
vitality and the jobs that go with it."

   The president has been promising a public attack on the
Democrats for more than two weeks, and he began a late
afternoon news conference yesterday with a statement blaming
Democrats for the lack of progress in the budget talks.
   The talks, which began in mid-May and broke off at the end
of July, are to resume immediately after Labor Day at Andrews
Air Force Base just outside Washington, congressional aides
said.
   Without an agreement, about $84 billion in automatic
spending cuts will be triggered under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, and Mr. Bush insisted yesterday that
"as painful as such deep cuts will be, I must uphold the law
. . . knowing that I've done all in my power to avoid them."
   Mr. Bush also strongly suggested he plans to veto any
appropriations bills that exceed his budget request. He
complained that the House already has passed 10
appropriations bills, eight of which exceeded his budget
request by $14 billion.
   He didn't mention, however, that Republicans voted for the
bills in large numbers, in many cases overwhelmingly.
Moreover, prominent Republicans -- including, on the Senate
side, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP leader, and Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, the top Republican on the Budget Committee --
have been conspicuous among those adding money for their home
states to spending bills.
   Mr. Bush said Democrats agreed at the last full meeting of
the bipartisan budget negotiators on July 26 to exchange
deficit-reduction proposals but didn't deliver. Democrats
deny that. "There may have been some miscommunication about
what was to happen," House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
said several days later.
   Notes taken by participants in the talks show that
although there was no explicit promise from Rep. Gephardt,
who chairs the talks, he did indicate that the two sides
would present offers within days. In a subsequent caucus,
however, Democratic negotiators were unable to agree on the
wisdom of putting forward a proposal just before the start of
the monthlong congressional recess or on the precise details.
   Senate Democrats were the primary obstacle, Democratic
participants in the budget talks say. Mr. Bush suggested as
much yesterday by specifically exempting Missouri's Rep.
Gephardt and House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington from
his harshest criticism.
   Although the Republicans didn't formally offer a plan, a
plan quickly leaked and has been criticized ever since -- by
Republicans as well as Democrats -- for suggesting higher
taxes on beer, wine and liquor as well as a $10,000 limit on
the deduction for state and local income taxes. Democrats sat
back and enjoyed the Republican disarray.
   "They've been laughing all the way to what they think is
the electoral bank," Mr. Bush said. "What I'm trying to do
now is to put it in focus so the American people will
understand that it is the Congress that must move now to
bring this deficit under control."
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine replied
that "the president's anger at the leak of the Republican
plan . . . should not serve as justification for unfair and
inaccurate criticisms of Democrats."
   Mr. Bush reiterated the administration's goal of reducing
the deficit by $50 billion in the first year and $500 billion
over five years. Administration officials acknowledge they
don't want to lower the target, even though some
congressional budget negotiators already are talking about a
smaller package, at least in the first year.
   All sides in the budget talks agree that the chances of
getting the kind of deep cuts in defense spending that some
Democrats have favored were reduced by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Mr. Bush yesterday referred to this by saying that
"our budget must maintain a defense posture consistent with
the demands on American leadership in the world and in the
dangers we face."
   The president also restated his support for cutting
capital gains taxes and his insistence on changing the
congressional budget process, which he termed "an utter
failure" at controlling spending.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
replied that Congress isn't solely responsible for the
deficits. "The policies of the Bush and Reagan
administrations must bear at least as much of the blame," he
said.
   "In most years, including this year, Congress has spent
less, not more, than President Bush or President Reagan
requested," Mr. Panetta said. "The president doesn't consider
it overspending when we spend on his priorities, only on
ours."
