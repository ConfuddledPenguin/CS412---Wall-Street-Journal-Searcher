   CHICAGO -- Whitman Corp. took its Hussmann Corp. unit off
the auction block after offers for the commercial
refrigerator manufacturing concern were judged inadequate.
   The consumer-products concern also said it will take a
special charge against earnings this year to reflect its
reorganization into an operating-company structure from a
holding company. It didn't say how large the charge will be.

   Concerning Hussmann, James W. Cozad, chairman and chief
executive officer, said "the economic value of the company is
clearly greater than the price we were offered, so we have
withdrawn it from the market." Whitman's other units include
specialty food maker Pet Inc., a PepsiCola bottler and the
Midas International automotive service franchiser.
   Previously, Sanyo Electric Co., a Japan-based maker of
consumer electronics and appliances, was said to have
submitted the highest bid for St. Louis-based Hussmann. That
bid, which was between $500 million and $600 million, was
said to be below Whitman's expectations. However, Sanyo last
month denied it had submitted a formal offer.
   Whitman, adding that orders for Hussmann equipment have
reached record levels after a weak first half, said it will
seek "to realize Hussmann's improving potential as a Whitman
company." Hussmann has about 40% to 45% of the market for
refrigerators and refrigerated display cases for supermarkets
and about 25% of the market for such equipment used in
convenience stores. In 1989, it had a profit of $60 million
on revenue of $789 million.
