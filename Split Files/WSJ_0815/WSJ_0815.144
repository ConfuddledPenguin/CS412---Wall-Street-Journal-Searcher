   Chiron Corp., marking its first profitable period ever,
posted second-quarter net income of $3.4 million, or 20 cents
a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million,
or 30 cents a share.
   Buoyed by strong diagnostic business and increased product
sales, the Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology company's
revenue nearly doubled to $17.7 million from $9.2 million in
last year's second quarter. Chiron's bottom line also
benefited from the stabilization of research and development
expenses and other costs.

   For the six months, Chiron posted a narrowed loss of $1.2
million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a year-ago
sixmonth loss of nearly $9 million or 68 cents a share. The
1990 results include first-quarter charges of $9.8 million
for technology acquisition, and $1 million in costs for
postponement of a planned manufacturing facility, Chiron
said.
   Leading the company's turnaround was profit from its
diagnostics joint venture with the Ortho Diagnostics unit of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the company said. Performance was also
buoyed by increased sales of Chiron's opthalmic products.
