   Was Hardly Objective

   Your July 30 Politics &amp; Policy article "New Jersey's
Florio Has Won Battles but Faces Tax Revolt, Loss of
Assembly" quoted Stephen Salmore opining on the loss of Gov.
Florio's credibility, and it identifies Mr. Salmore as a
political scientist at Rutgers University. Mr. Salmore is on
the Rutgers faculty, but he also is a paid adviser to
Republican candidates. Recently, he conducted a seminar for
local Republican nominees, advising them on strategies to
counter Gov. Florio.
   Had your reporter known about this connection, he might
not have given as much credence to Mr. Salmore's "spin." In
any case, it is a fact that readers might find helpful.

   Gov. Florio has proposed fair, honest answers for the
serious budget problems he inherited. He has enacted a reform
of our state's tax system that will ease the burden of high
property taxes on the middle class. While policy
disagreements and analysis are a welcome part of the process,
politically motivated statements masquerading as objective
commentary should be put in perspective.
