   Philadelphia's economy has escaped the fall from grace
seen in other Northeastern cities, mainly because it never
enjoyed the 1980s boom of a Boston or New York. But now it
appears to be mirroring the rest of the country in a slide
into recession.
   Construction and banking, for example, show signs of
decline, and the city government's fiscal woes don't help.
Still, economists expect the economy's "landing" in
Philadelphia to be reasonably soft.

   Like the model of a diversified investment portfolio, the
Philadelphia area has a little bit of everything --
manufacturing, financial services, government, health care,
retailing, defense, and construction -- but nothing
dominates. The mix dooms Philadelphia to mediocrity during
booms, say economists, but protects it from a real bust
during downturns.
   "We're better off than Boston and New York because we're
less specialized. We didn't go as high, so we're not going to
sink as deep," says William J. Stull, chairman of the
economics department at Temple University and co-author of a
new book on the region's economy.
   Philadelphia may even be saved the marked deterioration in
residential real estate other cities are experiencing,
because there was no speculative boom in that market, says
Bernard M. Markstein III, senior economist and vice president
of Meridian Bancorp., a Reading, Pa., based bank.
   Philadelphia's one distinction is the abysmal state of
city finances. Moody's Investors Service Inc. labeled the
city's bonds "junk," or "speculative grade," in July, and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. earlier this week said it is
considering a similar move. Philadelphia is the only major
U.S. city with bonds rated so low.
   Already saddled with a cumulative deficit of about $73
million, Philadelphia expects a $200 million deficit for the
fiscal year that began July 1, partly due to revenues
generally lower than the city projected and lower tax
payments from local developers, who are facing a business
decline. The city is trying to borrow $450 million in
short-term notes, and city officials warned this week that,
without such help, the government will run out of money in
November or December.
   A recession might worsen the city's problems by reducing
revenues, but if Philadelphia is forced to increase taxes,
that could create new problems. It would "aggravate the
migration . . . out of the city" by firms already
disenchanted with tax rates and poor services, says Patrick
Bradley, economist with Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corp.,
a bank holding company, "And then you have a declining
revenue base." Rough times for city employees could lower
consumer spending, he adds.
   There is some good news. Philadelphia's many universities
continue to attract research dollars, says Mr. Markstein, and
the medical industry, also strong in Philadelphia, "tends to
be recession-proof. They can raise prices because much of it
is paid for by insurance."
   Yet, like much of the rest of the U.S., Philadelphia is
watching growth slow to a crawl -- or worse. The thrift
crisis, for example, is partly responsible for a plunge of
37% in commercial construction in the second quarter of 1990,
compared with 1989. Under pressure from regulators, banks are
more reluctant to lend money for speculative building. They
now require that 65% to 70% of space be committed in advance,
up from 35%, before lending money to developers, says Thomas
W. Coyne, vice president and resident manager of Coldwell
Banker Commerial Real Estate Service's Philadelphia office.
   Downtown commercial vacancy rates are now at least 10%,
according to several estimates, and are expected to go as
high as 15% by 1991.
   While overall unemployment remains lower for Philadelphia
than for some other urban areas, it has increased steadily,
from 3.6% in the second quarter of 1989 to an estimated 4.6%
in the 1990 second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia.
