   WASHINGTON -- In a highly unusual move, the Energy
Department is offering to act as an intermediary between
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and a California community in a dispute
that is holding up production of as much as 100,000 barrels a
day of offshore oil.
   Department officials see resolution of the dispute over
the completed Point Arguello offshore oil project, near Santa
Barbara, Calif., as one of the fastest ways to help boost
U.S. oil production in the wake of possibly a four
million-barrel-a-day shortfall in world supplies because of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

   The $2.5 billion project, built by a consortium of oil
companies led by the Chevron Corp. unit, consists of three
offshore drilling platforms that mechanically have been ready
to begin production for 2 1/2 years. But no oil has been
produced because of deep disagreements between the oil
companies and local communities over how to move the oil 130
miles downshore to refineries in Los Angeles.
   Los Angeles and other communities blocked construction of
a new pipeline, and California coastal officials rejected a
plan to move the oil by tanker.
   According to a department official, Energy Secretary James
Watkins agreed to explore ways to try to settle the dispute
after the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted
yesterday to send a letter inviting federal involvement. The
county board is responsible for granting the permits that
could get the project running.
   Chevron indicated it would speak with federal officials,
but it seemed determined to stick to its original plan of
seeking a new permit from the board in November to transport
the oil by tanker on an interim basis until it can build a
new pipeline or work out a way to use existing pipelines.
   "I don't think they {federal officials} have either the
capability or the legal ability to resolve an issue that has
dragged on as long as it has in Santa Barbara County," said a
Chevron spokesman. The Department of Energy "is free to do
what it can to provide advice and counsel, and we'd be happy
to hear what proposals they have. But Chevron and its
partners are not running to the DOE, and we don't want to be
perceived as somehow using this national crisis," he said.
   Without a declaration in Washington of a national energy
emergency, which isn't planned, it's unclear what powers of
mediation are open to the Energy Department. The department
has begun looking for options to break the logjam, including
the possibility of using the Coast Guard to help prevent a
tanker spill. Another option might be to make light crude
available from a U.S. naval petroleum reserve to mix with
heavy Point Arguello crude, which otherwise is too thick to
move down an existing pipeline to Los Angeles. But officials
cautioned they have just begun to explore the feasibility of
those options and to look for others.
   Besides the three oil-drilling platforms, one of which is
operated by Texaco Inc. and two by Chevron, the project
includes a new onshore oil-treating plant. The pipelines are
already in place from the platforms to the treatment plant.
The dispute is over how to ship the oil from the treatment
plant, where water and natural gas are split from the oil, to
a refinery. Chevron estimates the field contains at least 200
million to 300 million barrels of oil.
   The Chevron spokesman said the project could begin
production at about 20,000 barrels a day, building up to
about 75,000 barrels within a year and full production of
100,000 barrels a day within three years. But Energy
Department officials who have spoken to some of Chevron's 17
oil partners said they've heard estimates that the project
could produce as much as 40,000 to 80,000 barrels a day in as
early as three to six months, with full production of 100,000
barrels a day eventually.
