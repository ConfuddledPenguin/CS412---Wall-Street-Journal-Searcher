   JORDAN'S KING IS EXPECTED to meet with Bush on the Mideast
crisis.
   The president is slated to meet tomorrow with King
Hussein, who is reportedly carrying a message from Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. While news of the Jordanian leader's visit
brought hope for a possible diplomatic solution, Bush said
the U.S. is ready to use its naval forces to shut down Iraqi
trade through Jordan. He added that the U.S. is still talking
to other nations, including the Soviet Union, to strengthen
such a move against Baghdad. The Soviets said they might join
a multinational force moving to block trade with Iraq if the
venture could be accomplished under U.N. control.
Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt called in the British,
French, Soviet and Chinese ambassadors in order to confer on
the proposal.

substances.

   A study confirmed that long-term AIDS survivors face an
increased risk of developing lymph cancer, despite better
medical treatment to fight life-threatening infections.
Scientists said that almost 15% of the patients in the study
developed an aggressive lymphoma following about two years of
therapy with the antiviral drug AZT.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS researchers said a new approach to treating an
intermediate form of the disease showed promise in a clinical
trial involving five patients. The significance of the
findings on the treatment, called photopheresis, was unclear
because so few patients were studied.
