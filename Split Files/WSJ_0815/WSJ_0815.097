   Federal Prisoners Are Unfair Competition

   In Georgia, a decorated Marine Corps veteran was denied
contracts that would have put unemployed Vietnam vets to work
making mattresses for VA hospitals. In Wisconsin, a
struggling small business was gradually squeezed out of the
market for electrical parts for the Army's tanks, while in
Michigan another small firm in the same line of business
folded. In other cases, severely handicapped workers have
lost opportunities for work due to their workshop's loss of
government contract opportunities.
   The single cause of these and other hard luck stories is
not foreign competition or shrinking federal procurement
budgets, but a 56-year-old law creating a preference in
federal contracting for one organization: Federal Prison
Industries, Inc., the government-owned corporation that runs
workshops employing convicts in federal penitentiaries.

   Over the years, Congress has created many programs to help
particular segments of the economy: Small businesses, Indian
tribes, minority-owned firms, sheltered workshops for the
blind and severely handicapped and many others are all
favored in the doling out of federal contracts. But the
organization that has the highest priority -- a statutory
right of first refusal on any federal supply contract -- is
FPI.
   FPI was created as a government-owned corporation in 1934.
By 1984, its sales -- all of them to the federal government
-- had reached $210 million; only four years later they had
jumped to $336 million, employing 13,330 inmates. That level
of sales puts FPI among the top 100 federal contractors,
ahead of Chrysler, Mobil Oil, Eastman Kodak and many other
big companies. FPI's dramatic growth is expected to continue,
partly because the number of inmates is expected to increase
sharply in the next five years.
   FPI is theoretically required by statute to charge
"current market prices," but that restriction has little
practical meaning. In 1930, for example, the War Department
asked the General Accounting Office whether it could purchase
commercial brooms since the only item offered by the prison
industries was a brush, with no handle, for which the price
was 80% higher. The GAO ruled that the War Department had to
purchase prison-made brushes if the Army could modify them to
meet its needs, and that any dispute concerning prices should
be resolved by arbitration. More recently, federal
procurement regulations have been issued requiring that
permission for an agency to purchase from a commercial firm
normally will not be granted merely "because of a lower
price."
   As a result, although FPI grants many waivers, in some
cases its prices still exceed commercial prices by a wide
margin. For example, a contractor who provides draperies to
the Navy in Norfolk, Va., for $18 per pair is being forced
out by FPI, which offers the same item for $26.
   Although FPI's prices are unrestricted, it is spared many
expenses faced by the firms it pre-empts. It pays no taxes,
no rent for land and no commissions to salesmen, while its
wages to prisoners range from 15 cents to $1.10 per hour. In
response, FPI points out that it bears some costs not
incurred by commercial firms and faces many other
disadvantages. Nonetheless, with all its competitive
advantages, coupled with the absence of any competition, it
is surprising that FPI is not more profitable than it is.
   In 1988, on sales of $351 million it reported net income
slightly under $21 million from its operations. Part of the
explanation lies in the fact that FPI spent more than $25
million for "selling, general and administrative expenses."
But a more fundamental factor is that much of FPI's cash flow
goes for the cost of goods sold.
   Although Congress has restricted the prison industries to
production of labor intensive items to provide employment for
"the greatest number of . . . inmates . . . as is reasonably
possible," FPI uses its profits to acquire equipment to
reduce its need for inmate labor, while relying heavily on
suppliers. In 1988, FPI spent more than $262 million for
materials while employing only 30% of the inmate population.
Strangely, its annual report to Congress for that year
boasted of "increased factory efficiencies" that resulted in
a 12.4% decrease in employment.
   As these figures suggest, for some items such as systems
furniture, FPI does little more than assemble the products it
sells. Although such items provide relatively little work for
inmates, they enable FPI to insert itself between commercial
firms and the purchasing agency and to reap the high profits
associated with prime contracts, with little related risk.
   Similarly, FPI has ignored congressional direction not to
pursue service contracts. Although it is authorized to
perform only supply contracts, FPI performed printing and
other service contracts totaling $13.14 million in 1984. FPI
not only profits from printing contracts directly, it also is
currently using them as justification for entry into related
fields, such as envelope manufacturing.
   All this might be well and good if FPI were giving inmates
vocational training that would be useful upon release.
However, the available data raise serious questions on that
point. A recent survey conducted by a furniture industry
trade association indicated that very few released federal
convicts had found employment in that industry despite FPI's
extensive activity in the field. Curiously, FPI itself has no
figures concerning the employment of its alumni upon
graduation.
   Congress responded to some of these problems in 1988 with
reform legislation designed to prevent undue concentration by
FPI in any particular industry. Under the statute, FPI must
notify the public and private industry representatives if it
plans to sell a new product or significantly expand
production of an existing one. Although limited by the law to
a "reasonable market share," FPI itself is to define that
term and to decide whether an increase in production of an
item is "significant," requiring notification to the public.
   There may be good answers to all the questions being asked
about FPI by small businesses around the country. New reform
proposals have been offered, congressional hearings have
already been held and more are expected. But is the special
treatment of the Federal Prison Industries program worth
preserving at all?
