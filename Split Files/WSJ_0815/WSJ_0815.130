   FRESNO, Calif. -- Westair Holding Inc. and its airline
operating unit, United Express, signed a $700 million
purchase option to buy as many as 60 Embraer EMB145 jets.
   The airline holding company said the preliminary agreement
between it and the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is subject
to the airline signing a formal purchase agreement in 1992.
