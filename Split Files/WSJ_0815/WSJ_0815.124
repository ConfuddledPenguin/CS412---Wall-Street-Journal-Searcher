   Tiffany &amp; Co. said its second-quarter earnings rose 27%,
boosted by a sales surge in international retail sales.
   The New York jewelry retailer said its second-quarter net
income rose to $7.1 million, or 45 cents a share, from $5.6
million, or 36 cents share, a year earlier. Sales rose 25% to
$107.3 million from $86 million a year earlier.

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Tiffany shares closed yesterday to $39.125, up $1.125.
   In a statement, Tiffany Chairman William R. Chaney
attributed the latest earnings increase to a surge in
international sales in both Asia and Europe, which "more than
compensated for the relatively low growth achieved by our
U.S. retail and direct-marketing businesses." He explained
that in the second quarter, Tiffany's international retail
sales rose 94% from a year earlier to $40.7 million, while
U.S. retail sales climbed only 2% to $50.7 million for the
same period.
   Tiffany also declared its quarterly dividend of seven
cents for each common share payable Oct. 10 to shareholders
of record on Sept. 20. Tiffany has 15.7 million common shares
outstanding.
