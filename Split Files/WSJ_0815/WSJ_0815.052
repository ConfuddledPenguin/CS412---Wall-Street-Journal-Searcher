   Few sons could be more devoted to their father's memory
than Sergei Khrushchev. His "Khrushchev on Khrushchev"
(Little, Brown, 423 pages, $24.95) is an interesting account
of his father's fall from power in October 1964, his
retirement under virtual house arrest, and the surreptitious
preparation of his memoirs, which were smuggled out and later
published in the West in the 1970s. Above all, the book is
the son's effort to fix Khrushchev's place in history --
after almost 25 years as a nonperson -- as a sort of
proto-Gorbachev.
   How does this claim stand up? Khrushchev's reputation
rests chiefly on his secret speech to the 20th Party Congress
in 1956. In it, he denounced Stalin three years after his
death for his crimes against the party (while omitting most
of his far greater crimes against the Russian people). Still,
Khrushchev and his colleagues ended the terror, closed most
of the camps (freeing millions), tolerated a cultural thaw,
and introduced a measure of "socialist legality" into Soviet
life.

   Though a confirmed ideologue, Khrushchev had enough
flexibility to attempt to reduce the bureaucracy's choke-hold
on the economy. He tried to decentralize government economic
decision-making, and later divided the provincial party
apparatus into industrial and agricultural units. He also was
something of a populist and tried to limit terms of higher
party officials. These moves failed, however, and provoked
the apparat, led by his protegee Leonid Brezhnev, to oust him
at age 70.
   But Sergei's dad also had been Stalin's viceroy of the
Ukraine in the later 1930s and a vocal proponent of the show
trials; he helped to Bolshevize the section of Poland annexed
in 1939, through arrests and deportations; he sent the tanks
into Budapest in 1956 and later ordered the execution of the
Hungarian leader, Imre Nagy; he built the Berlin Wall,
approved the vicious campaign against Boris Pasternak,
exploded the biggest nuclear weapons in the atmosphere to
intimidate the U.S., and brought us all to the brink by
sending missiles to Cuba.
   But if Sergei, an engineer with a nice writing style,
ignores his father's sizable warts, his descriptions of the
era are valuable. Sergei writes that he got wind of the plot
against his father in the fall of 1964, but that Khrushchev
didn't take it too seriously until he was summoned back from
his Crimean dacha to confront a united party leadership.
   Customarily, party officials would greet him at the
airport, but this time, Sergei recounts, "the tarmac in front
of the plane was empty except for two small figures looming
up in the distance. You couldn't make out who they were from
the plane. Not a good sign." One was the KGB chairman.
Feeling his age, Khrushchev acquiesced. "The fear's gone and
we can talk as equals," he said, alluding to the old terror.
"That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight." After a
deep depression, he lived out his years in a Moscow apartment
and a modest dacha where he practiced hydroponics.
   Urged by his family to write his memoirs, Khrushchev began
dictating in 1966. The tapes were transcribed secretly by
Sergei and others; ordered to cease writing by the Central
Committee, Khrushchev refused and had the tapes smuggled to
the West. Later, when the KGB forced Sergei to turn over his
copies, the son, using methods he still does not feel free to
reveal, gave a prearranged signal for publication. The former
ruler and his family were forced into dissidence and became
the oppressed, rather than the oppressor.
   The family got an even stronger dose of the system when
Khrushchev died in 1971. Their mourning had to wait while
party officials, looking for more memoirs, arrived at the
house to confiscate many of his papers. The mighty Politburo
feared this dead man, so the funeral was held under KGB
supervision; from the wake at the hospital, the coffin was
whisked off at high speed to a closely guarded cemetery
where, nonetheless, a crowd had gathered and a few speeches
were made.
   Not one member of the leadership called to offer
condolences. "Death equals everyone," Sergei writes bitterly.
"Unfortunately, a certain degree of culture is required to
understand this."
   Several years passed before Sergei could obtain official
approval for a modest graveside monument. The committee
required to approve the design was not under orders to
disapprove, but took the typical course of avoiding giving
possible offense to the authorities by doing nothing.
Eventually, at Mrs. Khrushchev's request, Premier Kosygin
intervened, and Sergei got his monument. Khrushchev's name
was again heard in party councils in a speech by Gorbachev in
1987.
   Sergei doesn't say whether Khrushchev's harassment led him
to question the system itself. Although Sergei himself was
clearly disgusted by his experiences, his comment at the
book's end, that perestroika began with the revolution in
1917, indicates he is either still a loyal communist or a man
with his head in the clouds. Perestroika can succeed only
with the recognition that 1917 marked not the beginning of
perestroika but the start of Russia's nightmare.
