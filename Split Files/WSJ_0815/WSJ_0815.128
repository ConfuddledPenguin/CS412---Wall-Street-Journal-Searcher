   NEW YORK -- The noise of 104 dogs is a terrible thing.
   You hear them before you see them, the block-long chorus
line of yipping, yapping, yowling wire-haired terriers -- and
a few rogue beagles -- outside Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom.
Gracie, the first terrier in line, strains against her leash,
sniffing the air for fame as she might a raw bone, and then
throws up.

   The canines came here yesterday to audition for the role
of Asta, in the upcoming $6 million Broadway musical "Nick
and Nora." If this couple sounds familiar, it's because they
first sashayed across the silver screen in 1933 in a hugely
successful adaption of Dashiell Hammett's book "The Thin
Man." The movie starred William Powell as Nick, Myrna Loy as
Nora -- and Skippy as Asta, their adorable sleuthing pup.
   When movie audiences first met gentleman detective Nick
Charles, he was shaking his fifth martini of the morning, his
heiress wife had a vicious hangover that prevented her from
decorating the family Christmas tree and Asta was attempting
to answer the telephone.
   These screwball touches, plus a couple of murders, a
frame-up and one bad dinner party, became elements of one of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most lucrative franchises. Five more
"Thin Man" movies (and four more wire-haired terriers)
followed. A television series starred Peter Lawford. For a
brief period in the early 1940s, Asta became the most popular
dog's name in America.
   Annie McNiff-Burgess, a research scientist at State
University of New York at Stony Brook is anxiously holding
the leash of dog Number 90 (her audition position). She
thinks her Tisbet is ready to assume the Asta mantle.
   "He's a worker, he's a lover, he's my children," she says.
   Tisbet is also half-beagle, half-Corgi. No matter, Ms.
McNiff-Burgess says. "I wanted to give him his shot at 15
minutes of fame."
   Inside Roseland, it's pandemonium. Dogs are fighting, dogs
are howling, dogs are licking everything that moves. The
owners of three battling pooches yank them roughly by their
collars. One dog is lifted off the ground and hangs in the
air. The owners look agonized when they're spotted by Warren
Eckstein, the pet trainer casting the role.
   Michael Eubanks, a Fordham University student, tells
four-year-old Gizmo to "Sit." Six times. Gizmo doesn't sit.
   A day before the casting call, director and co-author
Arthur Laurents admitted that he didn't want Asta to be in
the show. Mr. Laurents, the co-writer of "West Side Story,"
says directing dogs is "a bloody pain in the neck."
   Tony-award-winner Joanna Gleason, who will star as Nora
Charles, is more forgiving. "{In the theater} they say beware
of children and dogs, and that's true to a certain extent.
But this is Asta." Nonetheless, when 27 terriers and the
silver-haired matrons who own them surround Ms. Gleason and
co-star Barry Bostwick for the first of many photo
opportunities, the two smile gamely but look slightly
unnerved.
   Beneath the marquee at Roseland, reporters and public
relations people outnumber the puppies. The PR types are
wearing name tags and carrying yellow dog bones. Two hours
into the daylong event, the reporters begin interviewing each
other. Seeing this, the head of PR offers various reporters
an exclusive interview with a woman wearing whiskers and a
tail who claims she didn't know the audition was for canines.
"In `Cats' they have people," she says defensively.
   The requirements for Asta are straightforward, according
to James Pentecost, co-producer. "He has to bark on cue every
time the phone rings or the doorbell rings," he says. Asta
must have teeth with "carrying ability." Age isn't a factor,
though, Mr. Pentecost adds, "the older we get, the harder it
is to train us."
   While the producers of the show won't discuss the lucky
canine's compensation, Mr. Eckstein says that his dog, Tige,
of Buster Brown &amp; Tige ad campaign fame, probably made more
than $150,000 in the 1970s. The new Asta has every chance of
scooping up product endorsements. Already the star-to-be is
scheduled to woof it up on the syndicated talk show "Live
with Regis and Kathy Lee."
   As the auditions move along at about 25 dogs per hour, the
crowd gets surly. Ms. McNiff-Burgess, Tisbet's mother, is
beginning to suspect it's fixed: "I don't want to be
paranoid, but I think there are professionals here."
   As she speaks, Rex, a wire-haired fox terrier, perks up up
his floppy ears on cue and widens his big brown eyes. Rex
gets a callback. His owner, New York insurance salesman Tony
Salerno, attests to Rex's amateur status, though the
auditions certainly didn't exclude the pros.
   New York artist John Bobbish isn't as successful with his
high-spirited three-year-old named Dudley. Mr. Bobbish,
wearing an orange Hawaiian-print shirt with bulldogs on it,
screams at the barking terrier to "shut up," then grins and
pats him on the head. He brought Dudley to the auditions, he
says, because "everybody kept telling me in different bars
that I should."
   Before his dog's audition, Mr. Bobbish offers passers-by
drawings of Dudley, adding that his "surreal circus
paintings" can be seen soon at New York's Vorpal Gallery.
They feature "you know, dogs, baboons, women," he says.
   Charles Suisman, the show's other co-producer, has
stressed to pet owners that "we're open to non-traditional
casting." But no Irish Wolfhounds or German Shepherds make
the cut.
   Two-year-old Coco, a dead ringer for the original Asta,
does get a callback. Her owner, Ethel Albujar, a retired cab
driver and New York City schoolteacher, thinks Coco has a
great shot. Mrs. Albujar adds, "She sleeps between me and my
husband. It doesn't make for a good love life, but we love
her anyway."
   In general, working with puppies is no picnic, says
Charles Strouse, the show's composer. He should know, having
worked with Broadway's most famous canine, "Sandy," in two of
his other shows, "Annie" and "Annie II." In the latter, he
notes, the dog that played Sandy was always scanning the
wings for his trainer and looking the wrong way. The show was
a flop.
   Whatever happened to the original Astas? Hollywood never
offered the wire-haired star a lucrative leading role in
action-adventure pictures; these went instead to rivals
Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin. Asta was confined to brief cameos in
screwball comedies, working alongside stars like Katharine
Hepburn in "Bringing up Baby" and Cary Grant in "The Awful
Truth."
   But at least Asta's family members and namesakes benefited
from his legacy. Nikita Khrushchev, in a peace-offering to
President John F. Kennedy, once presented him with a
descendant of the Soviet space dog, Strelka. The puppy was
later mated with a cousin of one of the Astas.
   The star's name surfaced in politics again in November
1988, when then Vice President George Bush stopped at a
Westfield, N.J., home as part of a series of campaign visits
with average Americans. Asta, the family dog, was locked in
the bedroom.
   At the end of the auditions, nearly a hundred dogs have
called it a day. Only five potential superstars remain: Mr.
Smith, Hector, Ginger, Max and even a dog named Asta. The
role will be cast, and an understudy chosen, after more
auditions later this week.
   Mr. Strouse says he just hopes the terriers are trainable,
and can "sing." In a worst-case scenario, of course, the
dog's bark could simply be pre-recorded, he says. "But what's
happening to the theatre: both Madonna and Asta on tape?"
