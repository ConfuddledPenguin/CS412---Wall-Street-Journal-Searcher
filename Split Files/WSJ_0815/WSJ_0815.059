   WASHINGTON -- House Banking Committee Chairman Henry
Gonzalez and the Treasury Department are getting embroiled in
an increasingly sharp tussle over the conduct of
international financial policy.
   In the opening skirmish of what seems likely to be a long
struggle, Mr. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, accused the
Treasury of circumventing the constitutional right of
Congress to control government spending "in order to fund
both foreign currency intervention and certain parts of the
Brady plan." The Brady plan is the Bush administration's
strategy for dealing with international debt problems.

   Mr. Gonzalez cited a new General Accounting Office report
that says the Treasury provided Mexico a $192 million subsidy
as part of a debt agreement concluded this year. The Mexico
accord was the first under the Brady strategy, named for
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. According to the GAO, the
subsidy took the form of favorable prices on Treasury
securities the U.S. sold to Mexico. The GAO concluded that
the Treasury secretary has the authority to give such a
subsidy, but it said that "the pricing decision was neither
appropriate nor good policy."
   In testimony before the Banking Committee, the Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, David Mulford,
vigorously defended his department's actions and denied that
the Treasury had given Mexico a subsidy.
   Mr. Gonzalez, who is concerned about the Bush
administration's use of funds that aren't subject to
congressional control, is proposing legislation to make the
Treasury's so-called exchange stabilization fund subject to
full congressional review including audits by the General
Accounting Office. The fund, which currently totals about $26
billion, is used by the Treasury to intervene in
foreign-exchange markets and to make emergency loans to other
countries.
   Mr. Gonzalez's proposal also would prohibit the Federal
Reserve from lending money to the fund. The Fed currently has
$10 billion of loans outstanding to the Treasury for the
exchange stabilization fund. These loans have helped the
Treasury intervene aggressively in foreign-exchange markets,
boosting foreign currency holdings of the Treasury and
Federal Reserve to more than $47 billion as of June from
$17.3 billion in December 1988, according to Treasury
figures.
   Mr. Mulford strongly defended the Treasury's use of the
exchange stabilization fund. He said such operations have to
be conducted quickly and confidentially and therefore must be
under the sole control of the Treasury and can't be subject
to extensive congressional scrutiny. Congress for decades has
accepted the Treasury's sole authority over the fund, he
said.
   At the heart of the quarrel about the alleged subsidy to
Mexico is the price the Treasury set on zero-coupon
securities with a face value of $30.2 billion that it sold to
Mexico on March 28. The bonds, which were sold for $2.99
billion, were used to back new bonds Mexico has since
exchanged for its old bank loans. Zero-coupon bonds only pay
interest at maturity and are therefore priced at a big
discount from their face value.
   The Treasury decided to set the price based on the 30-year
coupon bond yield on Treasury securities. If it had set the
price according to that for similar instruments called strips
-- Treasury bonds stripped of their coupons -- the new bonds
would have cost Mexico $192 million more, the GAO says.
   Mr. Mulford suggested there were special circumstances
surrounding the new Mexican bonds. He said the issue was
quite large relative to the strips market, and he noted that
the price of an earlier issue of zero-coupon bonds for Mexico
in 1988 was set according to the coupon yield. And other
countries that sold Mexico zero-coupon bonds followed a
similar price formula, Mr. Mulford maintained.
   Nevertheless, not all Mr. Mulford's colleagues at Treasury
agreed with his arguments. In testimony to Mr. Gonzalez's
committee yesterday, Allan Mendelowitz, the GAO director who
compiled the report on the Mexico bonds, said that in the
weeks before the price decision, "the Treasury had an intense
internal debate over the proper pricing of the zeros that
would be sold to Mexico."
   And Mr. Gonzalez quoted from a memo by Treasury
Undersecretary Robert Glauber arguing against the pricing
formula that eventually was used. If such a formula was used,
it said, "some might even characterize it as an unauthorized
appropriation."
