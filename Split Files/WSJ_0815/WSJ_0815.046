   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. suspended publication of
Fortune France, a French-language version of its U.S. edition
published in partnership with Hachette Filipacchi Group.
   Time Inc. Magazines, the publishing unit of Time Warner,
said it backed out of the two-year-old venture after clashing
with its partner about the editorial direction of the
magazine. Time and Hachette shared revenue from the business
magazine, and Marshall Loeb, managing editor of the U.S.
edition of Fortune, had final approval of stories used in the
French edition.

   The closure of Fortune France is a setback to Time
Warner's plans to extend its major U.S. magazines in Europe
and Asia. Because of the disagreement over editorial policy
for Fortune France, Time executives said they won't go
through with plans to produce a Spanish edition of Fortune
with Hachette. In Italy, Time Warner currently publishes
Fortune Italia in partnership with Arnoldo Mondadori Editore
S.p.A.
   In a related development at home, Time Warner said it will
publish a test issue of a woman's magazine developed with
home entertainment entrepreneur Martha Stewart. The magazine,
called Martha Stewart Living, is being developed by Time
Publishing Ventures, a newly formed unit. The magazine's
first issue will appear in November, with a second issue
planned for early spring 1991.
   Despite a poor advertising market for magazines, Time
Warner has several other titles in the works, including
Fortune for Students, with distribution through Junior
Achievement, a nonprofit organization. There's also a sports
history magazine, with the working title Sports Illustrated
Classic, that will be published three times in 1991.
   With the largest U.S. and French magazine publishers
behind it, Fortune France was an early hit, selling out on
newsstands, and proving to be a model of expansion for Time
Inc. magazines in Europe. Time Warner and Hachette would have
shared profits, but the two-year-old magazine wasn't expected
to make money until after 1991.
   In the last year, advertising for Fortune France dropped
off. On newsstands, the magazine, with circulation of 50,000,
faced competition from a growing number of French and
European business magazines.
   In order to spur a new wave of interest in Fortune France,
according to Time executives, Hachette editors were calling
for more life style coverage in the business magazine.
Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, objected to
Hachette's plans. Hachette executives could not be reached
for comment.
   James B. Hayes, publisher of U.S. Fortune, said Time
didn't want to compromise Fortune's reputation. "Our
franchise is management issues and issues of importance to
corporate executives," he said.
