   Your July 5 page-one article on plastics recycling is
inaccurate, poorly researched and in my opinion generally
untrue. Millions of pounds a year of plastics are being
recycled currently. A number of plants are on-stream,
processing post-consumer plastics for recycling. New plants
are under construction, including several facilities for
National Polystyrene Recycling Co. to recycle post-consumer
polystyrene.
   The editorialized article presented a sarcastic viewpoint
of plastics recycling with generally incorrect information on
recycling processes and certainly misinformation on
recycled-plastics markets and uses. I cannot believe you have
progressed from business reporting to business bashing for a
significantly large industry.
