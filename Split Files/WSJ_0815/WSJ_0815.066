   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., fearful
of continued bank failures, proposed boosting bank insurance
premiums by the biggest amount in its history to raise an
extra $1.1 billion next year.
   The proposed jump is a sign that the FDIC is anxious about
ensuring that its bank insurance fund is big enough to handle
future failures without having to turn to taxpayers, who are
already angry that the bailout of the savings-and-loan
insurance fund will cost them $150 billion or more.

   "The point here is that we are increasing the cost of
deposit insurance to banks to meet a problem we are facing, a
decline in the fund," FDIC Chairman William Seidman said at a
board meeting yesterday. The proposal was passed unanimously
by the FDIC's five-person board, and is expected to be
approved after a 30-day comment period.
   The FDIC proposed to increase next year's premiums to 19.5
cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100 this year.
Last year's S&amp;L bailout bill had already mandated an increase
to 15 cents next year, but gave the FDIC the discretion to
raise the premium another 4.5 cents. The agency's proposal of
the maximum increase underlines its concern about bank
failures, especially as the economy appears to be heading
into a recession.
   The higher premiums could have a significant effect on the
banking industry. The FDIC said a $1.1 billion increase,
which would be brought in by the extra 4.5-cent assessment,
amounts to 7.3% of the industry's 1989 net income of $15
billion after taxes and nonrecurring gains. That doesn't
include the $850 million in payments that will result next
year from the increase to 15 cents from 12 cents mandated in
the bailout law.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Seidman said, the impact on the banking
industry is unclear because banks will try to pass along some
of the higher costs to their customers by lowering interest
rates paid on deposits or by increasing fees.
   In the first losses in its history, the FDIC's bank
insurance fund had deficits totaling more than $5 billion in
1988 and 1989, mostly from bailouts of banks in the
economically troubled Southwest. The losses have left the
fund standing at $13.2 billion, equal to about 70 cents per
$100 of insured deposits.
   While government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25
per $100 of deposits, Mr. Seidman has said the bank failures
could cost the FDIC as much as $2 billion this year, which
would leave the fund at about 60 cents per $100. The fund is
a backstop for about $2 trillion in insured deposits at
banks.
   "We have a considerable way to go to bring it back to the
level at which Congress thinks it should be," Mr. Seidman
said. The FDIC chief predicted it would take at least five
years to reach the $1.25 mark. He also said "it's our hope"
that the proposed premium increase would prevent a loss by
the bank fund next year.
   Charles Cranmer, a banking analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., said he was more concerned about whether the
increase would be enough to handle future bank failures than
about how the higher costs would affect banks. "If we're
heading into a recession, I'm not sure that will be enough,"
he said. "If we're staring at some big bank failures, then $1
billion won't make much of a difference."
   The banking industry responded guardedly to the proposal,
grudgingly accepting the premium increase as necessary, but
using it as an occasion to call for deposit-insurance
revisions aimed at lowering the government's costs in bank
bailouts.
   "Our industry has the capacity and willingness to meet our
obligation," said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of
the American Bankers Association. But, he said, "further
increases will place additional strain on bank earnings and
affect the industry's ability to raise capital."
   A trade group representing small community banks, the
Independent Bankers Association of America, wrote to the FDIC
last week urging the agency to consider assessing premiums on
deposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks -- which are
almost exclusively the bigger banks on the East and West
Coasts -- rather than raising premiums on domestic deposits.
   The IBAA estimated that the FDIC could raise $537 million
next year by assessing the foreign deposits at 15 cents per
$100. Technically, foreign deposits aren't insured, but the
association argues that the FDIC would never allow foreign
depositors to lose money. Assessing some other liabilities
mostly held by big banks could raise an additional $364
million, the association said.
