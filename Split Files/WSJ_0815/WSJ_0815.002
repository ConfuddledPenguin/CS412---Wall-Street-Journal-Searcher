   My flight's delayed, my luggage (new)
   Is on its way to Kalamazoo,
   The cocktail lounge is pouring belts
   For folks who'd rather be somewhere else,
   When asked when we'll get in the skies,
   The counterpeople roll their eyes.
   Whose fault is this familiar plight?
   I'll tell you who -- the Brothers Wright.
   -- Dick Emmons.

   Pilgrims' Progress
                                                                                                       

   You become even more impressed with the achievements of
our Founding Fathers when you realize they did it all without
opinion polls.
   -- Bruce Kafaroff.
