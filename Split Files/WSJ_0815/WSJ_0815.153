   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp. agreed to sell its troubled Home
Insurance Co. property and casualty insurance company to Vik
Brothers International, a European-based investor group, for
$544 million.
   Under the agreement, which includes Home Insurance
subsidiaries Gruntal Financial Corp., Sterling Forest Corp.,
US International Re and Commonwealth Insurance Co., Vik
Brothers will also assume $76 million of AmBase's corporate
debt. The proposed deal leaves in place $285 million of
Series A cumulative preferred stock of Home Insurance.

   The sale of Home Insurance, which had been on the block
since February, leaves AmBase essentially a thrift holding
company. In March, its board ousted Marshall Manley, one of
the insurance industry's highest-paid executives, as
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Manley had
embarked on an acquisition spree in 1985 in an effort to get
AmBase into a variety of financial services. But the strategy
didn't impress Wall Street; the company's stock price has
tumbled about 75% since 1986.
   By the time the deal is completed, AmBase's debt is
expected to stand at $730 million. The company said it will
use the proceeds from the sale to help pay off that debt.
AmBase will also sell in the open market preferred stock in
Home Insurance with a face value of $124 million, a company
spokesman said.
   Because both efforts to raise cash will fall short of
covering AmBase's indebtedness, it's not likely the company
will be able to distribute a special dividend it had
previously promised to shareholders.
   When the deal is completed, subject to completion of a due
diligence review by Vik Brothers, a definitive agreement and
regulatory approvals, AmBase's holdings will consist of
Carteret Bancorp. Carteret is a thrift institution based in
Morristown, N.J, with about $6 billion in assets.
   The sale of Home Insurance, which has annual revenue of
more than $2 billion, marks an inauspicious end to AmBase's
plan to build a financial superstore for consumers. A few
years ago, AmBase spent more than $400 million to add
Carteret and Gruntal, a securities firm. In its 1988 annual
report, the company's managers said they had created one of
the nation's top 20 financial services concerns.
   Since then, however, the company has been rattled by
earthquakes, junk-bond problems and bad loans to the
now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   George Scharffenberger, chairman and chief executive of
AmBase, said Vik Brothers was "committed to Home's strategic
direction and its current management team." Mr.
Scharffenberger added, "The purchase price paid by Vik
Brothers International reflects the tremendous improvement in
the underwriting operations of the Home Insurance Co. over
the past four years."
   Historically, Home Insurance has been a mediocre
performer, though in recent years AmBase has tried to revamp
its business and cut its exposure to natural disasters.
Although Home Insurance is still losing money on its
underwriting operations, its financial position has improved
somewhat.
   The insurance unit's combined ratio -- a common measure of
performance in the insurance industry calculated by adding
claims paid and expenses, then dividing by premiums paid by
policy holders -- had improved to 110.4 in the most recent
quarter, from about 135 in 1985, according to the company
spokesman.
   Separately, AmBase reported a net loss for the second
quarter of $106 million, or $3.12 a share. That compares with
net income of $30 million, or 90 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 15% to $770 million from $911 million.
AmBase attributed the poor results to losses realized by the
high-yield portion of the investment portfolio of Home
Insurance.
   Vik Brothers' bid for Home Insurance is the latest
acquisition of a U.S. insurance company by a foreign buyer.
Earlier this month, Allianz AG of West Germany agreed to
acquire the Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. unit of Fund
American Cos. for $1.1 billion. In June, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of Japan, agreed to pay $312 million for about
10% of Lincoln National Corp., a Fort Wayne, Ind., multiline
insurer.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AmBase shares closed at $7.50, up 12.5 cents.
   Vik Brothers officials weren't available for comment.
