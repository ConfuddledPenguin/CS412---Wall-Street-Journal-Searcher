   The West German heavy engineering group Deutsche Babcock
AG expects to post an as yet unspecified pretax loss for its
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, after suffering a 15 million
mark ($9.5 million) loss in the six months ended April 30.
   "We have hard times ahead of us," Oberhausen-based
Babcock's new chairman Heyo Schmiedknecht said. At around the
start of fiscal 1990, Babcock had expected to post a pretax
profit of between 50 million and 70 million marks for the
full year.

   "We must reckon on a clear pull-back of our financial
results," the 51-year-old executive said, adding that "we are
expecting a loss" before taxes for 1990.
   The company reported back in May that it suffered an
undisclosed pretax loss in the first five months of its
fiscal year and that it didn't expect a profit for the full
year.
   In fiscal 1989, Deutsche Babcock's net income fell 91% to
3.8 million marks from 40 million marks a year earlier. The
sharp decline prompted Babcock to omit its regular annual
cash dividend for fiscal 1989.
