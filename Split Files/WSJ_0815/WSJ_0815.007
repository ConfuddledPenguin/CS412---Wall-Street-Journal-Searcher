   Scientists uncovered a gene they suspect holds the key to
how cigarette smoke causes lung cancer.
   Tests of tissues from lung cancer patients indicated that
a particular gene had been "turned on" in the patients and
was producing a protein that turned chemicals in cigarette
smoke or other inhaled chemicals into powerful cancer-causing
substances.

   If true, this would explain one of the major mysteries of
smoking-related lung cancer. This is the fact that despite
decades of analysis, the known cancer-causing chemicals in
cigarette smoke don't account for its apparent ability to
cause lung cancer in humans.
   The discovery of the gene also suggested why only 5% to 7%
of long-term cigarette smokers develop lung cancer. The
scientists speculated the suspect gene is turned on more
easily in some people than in others, rendering them most
likely to get lung cancer if they smoke. Some people may be
born with a high likelihood that the gene will be turned on
and they are in danger of developing lung cancer even if they
don't smoke, speculated Theodore L. McLemore, a pulmonary
disease specialist who headed the research team.
   If the theory proposed in the new report is correct, it
may be possible to screen cigarette smokers and pinpoint
those at highest risk of developing lung cancer, Dr. McLemore
said in a telephone interview. It also should be possible to
screen families of lung cancer victims to see which relatives
might have inherited a predisposition to the deadly diseases.
   The new report, published in the current issue of the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, comes but two weeks
after two other reports suggesting that a genetic
predisposition to lung cancer makes it extremely dangerous
for those born with the predisposition to smoke cigarettes.
One of these reports showed that smoking-related lung cancer
tended to run in families. The other showed that the
genetically-controlled manner in which the body processed a
particular drug seemed linked to a susceptibility to lung
cancer.
   The report pinpoints a specific gene that is closely
linked to, if not the cause of, the cancer-producing process.
The gene is known as the CYP1A1 gene, according to the report
by Dr. McLemore and his colleagues at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., and the Johns Hopkins University
medical school in Baltimore.
   Dr. McLemore left the cancer institute at the end of July
to go into private practice in Paris, Texas, where, he says,
he plans to continue his research on the lung-cancer gene.
   In their report, the researchers said they had examined
the activity of the CYP1A1 gene in lung tissues taken from 56
men and women who had been operated on for lung cancer at
Johns Hopkins.
   The researchers tested the normal, or noncancerous,
portions of lung tissues from the patients for signs of
whether the gene was active or not. The tests indicated that
the gene was active, or "turned on," in 17 of 19 smokers but
was inactive in all five of the patients who had never
smoked. Examination of the normal lung tissues from other
patients who had quit smoking indicated that the gene was
turned off in those who hadn't smoked for three months or
longer.
   They also found that in the cancerous tissues the gene was
more likely to be turned on in smokers than in nonsmokers.
   The findings "further support the theoretical role of the
CYP1A1 gene" in causing lung cancer by showing that is active
in smokers who develop lung cancer, the researchers said.
"However, it is not possible to conclude a definite cause and
effect relationship from these studies," they cautioned.
   Nevertheless, the scientists pointed to a plethora of
animal experiments which hinted that the protein produced by
the gene may well lead to cancer. It's known that production
of the protein, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, can be induced
by cigarette smoke, they noted. The protein, they said,
belongs to a "superfamily" of proteins, many of which are
capable of activating cancer-causing chemicals found in
cigarette smoke.
