   IN THE PERSIAN GULF -- Aboard the U.S.S. LaSalle, the
squeal of the chemical attack siren cuts the steamy morning
air. "End of test," says a calm voice over the ship's public
address system. "Regard all further alarms."
   The U.S. Navy is back, in force, in the gulf, on a mission
with new risks and new rules that aren't yet fully defined.
When the U.S. fleet sailed in here in 1987 in efforts to stop
Iranian attacks on shipping, it was Iraq that benefited as
U.S. ships permitted the safe passage of Iraqi oil.

   Now, Iraq is the enemy. Helicopter pilots, ferrying
supplies to the U.S. armada, wear newly printed "Saddam
Busters" T-shirts under their flight suits.
   The Aegis-class cruiser Antietam scrambled to program its
cruise missiles with new targets. Until five days ago, the
ship's vast store of preprogrammed enemy objectives didn't
include any targets in Kuwait and Iraq, according to one
crewman.
   Aboard the fleet's flagship, LaSalle -- painted white to
reflect the heat -- Adm. William Fogarty commands 24 ships,
200 aircraft and 17,000 troops who don't yet know exactly
what they will be called upon to do.
   Some are finding out exactly where they are. Senior
officers talk about setting up operations in "Ridyar,"
stumbling over the name of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
Crewmen are even more confused. "To tell you the truth, I
didn't know where Kuwait was," says a young engineman aboard
the Antietam, which was cruising in the southern Indian Ocean
when orders came through to rush to the gulf.
   Others are baffled by Islamic fundamentalists' complaints
that American "infidels" are defiling the soil of Saudi
Arabia, which contains the holy city of Mecca. "The {Saudi}
government asked for our assistance," says Antietam's
captain, Lawrence Eddingfield. "And I don't feel like an
infidel."
   Capt. Eddingfield begins lunch in the officer's mess with
a prayer that "God be with the world leaders" and help them
keep the peace.
   "We are not here to start anything. We are not
war-mongering," he says. To help his men understand their
mission, he has installed an Associated Press newswire aboard
ship. Copies of a Time magazine cover story on Saddam Hussein
were photocopied and passed around.
   So far, the ships are playing a sweaty game of watching
and waiting, hoping their missiles and big guns will help
deter any Iraqi strike on Saudi Arabia. But the Navy's main
role is likely to become enforcing the United Nations embargo
on Iraq's trade, blocking goods going in and oil going out of
the ports of Iraq and Kuwait.
   Adm. Fogarty says Washington still is working on details
of how such intercepts might work, if and when Iraq
challenges the embargo.
   But one thing everybody knows is that Saddam Hussein has
threatened to use chemical weapons. The unthinkable has
become routine for the Antietam's young crew, whose average
age is 22. A lieutenant cheerfully demonstrates what he calls
"the latest and greatest the Navy has come up with" -- a
green hooded smock and pants, filled with chemical-absorbing
charcoal, thick rubber gloves and boots, and a lightweight
face mask. Crew members are taught to recognize the symptoms
of exposure to various chemical agents. Nerve gas, explains
the still-cheerful lieutenant, "makes your mouth water like
you haven't eaten for two days and you just sat down in front
of a steak dinner." In such a case, crewmen are supposed to
jab their thighs with prepared injections of a blocking agent
called atropine.
   There isn't any easily administered antidote for blood
agents such as cyanide, which can kill in seconds, nor for
blistering agents such as mustard gas. But ships' crews are
vastly better off than land forces, since the ship can go
"circle William" -- code for sealing off the interior air
supply. Heat stress in the protective suits also isn't as
dangerous at sea, as the crew can take turns outside in the
heat and inside where there is air conditioning.
   But even without the special horrors of chemical war,
conventional threats abound. On the fore deck, two crewmen
peer into the azure waters of the gulf, scanning for mines
left behind from the Iran-Iraq war.
   Saddam Hussein has Exocet missiles, the weapons that
killed U.S. sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark in 1987. An Iraqi
pilot apparently misidentified the Stark as an Iranian craft.
Unready for an attack, the Stark had its Phalanx system -- a
gatling gun firing high-density anti-missile pellets --
switched off.
   The Stark "was a tragedy, but we did learn a lot of
lessons from it," says Adm. Fogarty. "We had exercises and
drills every day on that thing."
   Another tragedy with less easily learned lessons was the
1988 shooting down by the U.S.S. Vincennes of an Iran Air
passenger jet that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft.
The Antietam, like the Vincennes, is an Aegis-class cruiser
with a similar computerized command center. Because the
Iranian Airbus accident was attributed to human error,
procedures in the command center haven't been significantly
revised.
   Below deck, huge blue screens try to make electronic sense
of the shipping clutter and crowded airways of the gulf. In
cool darkness, the hot bright waters, their fishermen and
traders, are reduced to obstructions: squares for unknown
surface vessels, circles for "surface friendlies," cup shapes
for submarines. Anything that can't be identified by radar
requires reconnaissance by helicopters.
   For the ordinary people of the gulf, all this high-tech
weaponry makes life difficult and dangerous. Youssef Bin
Dahraj's fishing boat was off the Saudi coast four nights ago
when a U.S. helicopter came swooping down to take a look. His
crew of Madrasi sailors, terrified by the encounter, now
refuse to go more than a few miles from their home port in
Bahrain.
   "It means less fish, less money," he says.
   Dozens of fishermen and small traders were caught in the
crossfire of the Iran-Iraq war. In 1987, Americans shot an
Indian fisherman in the gulf, mistaking him for an Iranian
terrorist. Mr. Bin Dahraj lost a friend, whose boat hit a
mine. The small, high-prowed wooden dhows that ply the gulf
"shatter like matches," the fisherman says, shaking his head
sadly. "Now, it seems we are once again too close to war, and
everyone is afraid here."
