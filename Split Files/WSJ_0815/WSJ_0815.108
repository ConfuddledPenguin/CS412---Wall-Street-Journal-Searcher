   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. reported second-quarter net income
climbed 26% on a 20% rise in revenue, led by auction sales of
Impressionist paintings, books and manuscripts and other
items.
   The New York-based auction house said net was $64.3
million, or $1.12 a share, up from $51.2 million, or 89 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue advanced to $196 million
from $163 million.

   Sotheby's cautioned that second-half total auction sales
may drop from an "exceptionally strong" year-earlier figure
of $1.6 billion. First-half auction sales climbed 20%, also
to $1.6 billion.
   The spring season saw "strong" demand and high prices for
a number of artworks, said Michael L. Ainslie, president and
chief executive officer.
