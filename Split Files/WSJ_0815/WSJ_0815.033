   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Just as Brazilian President Fernando
Collor de Mello was proclaiming that "the government is
winning the battle against inflation," the rise in oil prices
and threat of a world economic downturn following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait have dashed Brazil's growing mood of
optimism.
   The menace of a new oil shock comes at the worst possible
time for Brazil. Nearly five months into a bold
anti-inflation plan, results were starting to show. Instead,
it faces the possibility of recession and higher inflation,
further complicating Brazil's ability to start repaying its
$112 billion foreign debt, the developing world's largest.

   "Maybe God isn't Brazilian any more," says former central
bank president Carlos Langoni. "The timing of this couldn't
be worse. There was great progress in the past two months in
breaking inflationary expectations, but the program could be
slowed down now." Adds economist Edmar Bacha: "We are in a
very critical phase of the stabilization plan, and {a new oil
shock} could be the difference between getting inflation down
more or keeping it where it is."
   So far -- much to the surprise of many economists and
businessmen -- the anti-inflation policy's results have been
impressive, and government officials say it's too early to
predict they will be derailed by the Middle East conflict. A
few months ago, economists were predicting that the
difficulty of administering the plan's centerpiece, a huge
liquidity squeeze that took two-thirds of the country's money
out of circulation, would plunge Brazil into recession or
back into runaway inflation. In fact, neither has happened.
   "We escaped the risk of a collapse of the economy, deep
recession or a return to hyperinflation and the government is
showing a surprising degree of determination," says Andre
Lara Resende, vice president of Unibanco bank, who was
skeptical at first about the government's austerity measures.
   Inflation, which reached 84.3% in the month preceding the
implementation of the plan, stood at 12.9% in July after the
lifting of most price controls. This has been achieved with
Brazil suffering a drop in gross national product for 1990 of
between 3% and 5% of last year's $370 billion. GNP is the
total value of the goods and services a nation produces.
After falling sharply in the initial months, employment
picked up in June. The government has begun regaining control
of spending and monetary policy and has cut more than 100,000
public sector jobs. And it has so far resisted claims for a
return to wage-price indexation despite a wave of strikes and
looming elections.
   But this bright picture faces challenges in the coming
weeks -- on which events in the Persian Gulf could have a
major bearing. The biggest and most immediate challenge is on
wages. Brazil's Congress is scheduled to vote on Aug. 21
whether to override a presidential veto of a bill
reintroducing wage-price indexation. Although Mr. Collor
warned recently that a return to indexation would bring a
return to hyperinflation or "a brutal recession," some
analysts fear that electoral pressures could lead congressmen
running in the Oct. 3 elections to vote for it. Oil-fed
inflation would make it even more difficult for the
government to resist indexation.
   The pressure certainly is there. For many Brazilians, even
if inflation is lower than before and prices rise more
slowly, life is more expensive because their salaries haven't
followed inflation like they used to. "Collor doesn't go
shopping like I do," says cleaning lady Luiza Gomes Montes.
"Things just get harder and harder." Even the armed forces
have begun grumbling about their pay.
   More than 500 strikes have broken out since the plan was
unveiled. At Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, a state-owned
steel company, workers ended a strike of over one month this
weekend. The government stayed carefully away from the
conflict and won the support of the Supreme Labor Court,
which termed the workers' demands excessive and granted them
only small increases. But Mr. Collor's plan will face new
challenges at collective bargaining negotiations in key
public sector areas during the next few months. Also in the
shortterm, economists say, the government faces inflationary
pressures because of the overvalued cruzeiro that raises the
price of exports.
   A major longer-term challenge is to convince Brazilians --
and foreign creditors -- that the improvement in public
finances that the government boasts of is real and durable.
Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello claims Brazil has
achieved a feat "unparalleled in history," turning a huge
budget deficit last year into a predicted 1.22% surplus this
year. But even this figure raises skepticism. "The government
says it will post a surplus and maybe it will," says former
central bank President Affonso Celso Pastore. "We'll have to
wait and see."
   Whether the surplus is real or not is of crucial interest
to Brazil's foreign creditors, who want Brazil to start
paying its arrears and resume debt negotiations. But Brazil,
which suspended all debt payments last summer, says it won't
threaten its economic growth by resuming payments. Its
position is likely to harden if an international recession
sets in.
   "Debt payments seem to be very low on the priority list,"
says Mr. Lara Resende. At the same time, Brazil is hoping to
obtain a $1.4 billion standby loan from the International
Monetary Fund on the basis of the results it has achieved so
far.
