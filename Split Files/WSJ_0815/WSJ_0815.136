   NEW YORK -- The summer doldrums encumbered the bond market
yesterday as trading activity slowed to a trickle. Prices
ended mixed.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1/4
point higher yesterday, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, fell to 8.77% from 8.80% on
Monday.

   Short-term securities, however, ended unchanged to as much
as 1/8 point lower. The yield on two-year notes rose to 7.93%
from 7.89% on Monday.
   But very little trading actually took place yesterday,
largely because several large bond dealers, so-called
interdealers, were still without operable equipment due to a
power outage in New York's financial district. Interdealer
brokers act as so-called "blind" brokers who buy and sell
bonds for securities firms and commercial banks.
   The lack of investor interest in bonds also contributed to
the market's muted tone.
   Michael Moore, head of government trading at Continental
Bank in Chicago, said that investors appear reluctant to
change their current investment positions due to numerous
economic uncertainties.
   "We're in a period of watching and waiting to see where
the Federal Reserve leads us," said Mr. Moore. He said that
while many investors believe that the Fed will eventually
ease credit conditions by cutting the federal funds rate from
its current 8% level, investors are less certain than they
were a week ago about the timing of such a move.
   Many investors, he said, had expected the Fed to ease next
week after its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
But now, he said, "we're seeing a change in attitude." The
change in expectations occurred yesterday morning after the
Department of Commerce released the retail sales report for
July.
   The government reported that retail sales in the month of
July grew 0.1%. Although that was considered very weak, the
market discounted the figure because of huge revisions made
to previous retail sales statistics. The government revised
the growth in June retail sales upward to 1.1% from an
earlier estimate of 0.5%.
   And after reviewing new data, the department said retail
sales slipped only 0.1% in May instead of the 0.6% it
estimated earlier.
   Bond investors interpreted the sharp revisions as an
indication that the economy hasn't been as weak as many
economists have suggested, and therefore, the Fed may be
under no urgent need to ease credit conditions.
   Bond prices were lower for much of the morning, but
switched directions and started rising in afternoon trading,
taking its cues from the futures market.
   Bond prices moved to the highs of the day following news
that Jordan's King Hussein and President Bush will meet in
Washington. The Jordanian king was said to be carrying a
letter from Iraq's Saddam Hussein, with whom he met Monday.
   The news "lifted investors' spirits and helped move
Treasury prices higher" as some people concluded that the
meeting would cool tensions between the U.S. and Iraq, said
Kevin Logan, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp. of New York.
   In the municipal bond market, new issue activity was
extremely busy as more than $4.7 billion in debt was priced.
   The bulk of the issuance was comprised of $4.1 billion of
California revenue anticipation notes priced by a group led
by Bank of America. The deal was the largest single issue
ever for the state. The notes, which are due June 28, 1991,
have a coupon rate of 6.25% to yield 5.80%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury, Agency Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds ended at a price of
99 21/32, up from 99 13/32 on Monday. The latest two-year
notes ended at 100 3/32, down from 100 5/32 on Monday. The
yield on the two-year notes rose to 7.93% from 7.89%.
   Short-term rates moved higher. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.45% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.68%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.34% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.71%.
   In the agency market, the Federal Home Loan Banks issued
$565 million of three-year bonds priced at par to yield
8.18%. The bonds, which mature Aug. 25, 1993, will be sold
through the Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds coasted as investors settled for another day of
lackluster summer trading.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged.
   However, junk bonds of Duracell Holdings Corp. and AmBase
Corp. bucked the broader market trend and advanced.
   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes gained 1 point
to end at 95 after the company announced that it had signed a
letter of intent to sell its Home Insurance Co. unit to Vik
Brothers International, a European-based investor group.
   The company said proceeds from the sale, together with the
estimated proceeds from the sale $124 million par value of
Home Insurance's cumulative preferred owned by AmBase, will
be used to liquidate outstanding debt.
   Meanwhile, Duracell Holdings' 13.125% senior subordinated
notes ended 3/8 point higher at 103 1/2 after the company
reported strong earnings. Duracell reported net income of $6
million for fiscal 1990 compared with a loss of $106 million
in fiscal 1989.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds issued to finance real estate
developer's Donald Trump casinos weakened in the wake of the
New Jersey Casino Control's Commission's report on July
gaming revenues.
   The report, which provides a breakdown of revenues at each
of Trump's Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, was in line with
preliminary figures.
   Trump Plaza Funding Corp.'s 12.875% first mortgage bonds
shed 1/2 point to end at 70 while Trump Castle Funding
Corp.'s 13.75% first mortgage bonds slipped 1/2 point also to
end at 48 1/2.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% first mortgage bonds
also closed 1/2 point lower at 40.
   Activity in the junk bond market is expected to continue
at a slow pace today as many market participants will be away
attending Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.'s
two-day high-yield conference.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended stronger, bolstered by
rising stock prices, a firmer yen and declining interest
rates.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the price of
Japan's benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at 83.34, up 0.08
point, to yield 8.025%.
   After the exchange closed, rumors that the Finance
Ministry would buy bonds to support the market caused yields
on the benchmark bond to fall as low as 7.97% in
over-the-counter trading.
   In Europe, trading was quiet in most major markets as
investors and traders prepared for today's Assumption
holiday. Most European financial markets will be closed for
the holiday, with the exception of Britain.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 3/8 point higher in
extremely light dealings.
   Activity during the day focused on the heavy amount of new
issues.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 closed 3/8 higher at 98 3/8 to yield
7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities closed with modest gains of up to 1/8
point.
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities for August delivery were up 1/8
at 99 3/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were
up 3/32 at 98 30/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association
9.5% issues closed up 3/32 at 99 15/32.
   Highlighting primary market activity was the release of
pricing details on a $1.05 billion Fannie Mae real estate
mortgage investment conduit issue, offered by First Boston
Corp.
   The offering is backed by Fannie Mae 9% securities.
   The Fannie Mae Remic had been underwritten earlier, but
details of the offering weren't unveiled publicly until this
morning.
   In the asset-backed sector, the next sizable issue awaited
is a three-year $1.25 billion Citicorp global deal
securitized with credit-card receivables.
   Officials at Citicorp weren't immediately available for
comment on the timing of the sale or spread talk on the
offering.
