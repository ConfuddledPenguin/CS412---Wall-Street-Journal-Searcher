   Interco Inc. made an $8.6 million interest payment on its
medium-term notes, indicating the company is confident its
banks and bondholders will agree to restructure its $1.9
billion in debt.
   The payment was the first sign of progress since the
troubled furniture and shoe company announced two weeks ago
that it had reached a "basic agreement" on a debt
restructuring plan. "They certainly wouldn't have made that
payment if they didn't think they had a deal," said Wilbur
Ross, a Rothschild Inc. managing director who is advising
holders of junk bonds issued in Interco's disastrous 1988
recapitalization.

   If St. Louis-based Interco hadn't made the payment,
medium-term noteholders could have pushed the company into
bankruptcy law proceedings as early as today, when the grace
period was set to expire. The medium-term notes predate the
1988 recapitalization.
