   WASHINGTON -- Jordan's King Hussein arrives in the U.S.
today for a meeting with President Bush, bringing hope of a
possible diplomatic solution to the Middle East crisis. At
the same time, the president said the U.S. may use its
warships to shut down Iraqi trade through Jordan.
   The two developments signaled the pivotal role that Jordan
and its king are suddenly playing in the crisis touched off
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week. Jordan could give
Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein his best hope -- perhaps his
only hope -- of opening a loophole in a global trade embargo
against Iraq. At the same time, the Jordanian monarch could
give the U.S. a path to Saddam Hussein at a time when the
fate of Americans and other foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait
remains in doubt.

   In another sign that Iraq may be attempting to send
signals to the U.S., ABC-TV newsman Ted Koppel was allowed
into Bagdhad and said he was told by a senior Iraqi foreign
ministry official that Jordan's King Hussein will be carrying
a message from Saddam Hussein that time remains to discuss an
end to the confrontation.
   Mr. Koppel said the Iraqi official termed Americans stuck
in Iraq and Kuwait as "restrictees" who won't be permitted to
leave until the current crisis ends.
   With its location between Iraq and the Red Sea, Jordan and
its port city of Aqaba have assumed critical strategic
significance. "If it's a hole through which commerce flows in
an otherwise tight net, I would certainly think that Aqaba
should be closed to Iraq commerce," President Bush said at a
news conference.
   He indicated that the U.S. is ready to press its
"interdiction" of Iraqi trade -- but that the U.S. is
continuing to talk to other countries, including the Soviet
Union, seeking further multinational backing to strengthen
such a move. "I think the world wants to see these . . . .
sanctions carried out," he said.
   The Soviet Union let it be known yesterday that it might
join the U.S. and other nations moving to block trade with
Iraq if the venture could be accomplished under the control
of a little-known United Nations body called the Military
Staff Committee.
   Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt called in the
British, French, Soviet and Chinese ambassadors to confer on
the proposal. Asked about it, President Bush said: "I don't
have any problem talking to the Soviets about that," adding:
"It would be a very good thing to have an active Soviet
presence." However, he said he believed it was not essential
that the plan occur under U.N. auspices.
   At the same time he was warning of a possible interdiction
of shipping through Jordan, Mr. Bush yesterday held out the
enticement of aid to Jordan, should King Hussein choose
voluntarily to shut down commerce with Iraq. "We've helped
them in the past," Mr. Bush said, adding: "We'd help them in
the future -- if they fulfill their obligations here."
   Although King Hussein is reportedly carrying a message to
President Bush from Saddam Hussein, President Bush said that
the Jordanian leader had telephoned him seeking only to
confer about the "whole situation." The meeting is scheduled
tomorrow, at President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   The king's shuttle mission between Baghdad and Washington
-- undoubtedly the most delicate mission in his 37-year reign
-- illustrates his strategic dilemma. Caught between Iraq and
the West, he is desperately trying to satisfy both sides.
   "It's important to keep lines of communication open," says
William Quandt, a former National Security Council Middle
East analyst now at the Brookings Institution. And King
Hussein may be a particularly energetic mediator, Mr. Quandt
says, because "he probably more than anybody else hopes it's
over soon."
   Jordan has grown dependent on Iraq both economically and
politically. It relies on Iraq for almost all its oil and for
the big fees it has earned for shipping in Iraqi goods. And
as the influx of Soviet Jews and the introduction of a
right-wing government in Israel threatens to push more and
more Palestinians into Jordan, King Hussein has come to rely
on Iraq more and more for protection from Israel.
   Just as important, King Hussein couldn't repudiate the
Iraqi president without jeopardizing his country's internal
stability. The Hashemite monarch is presiding over a country
whose population is about 60% Palestinian, and Palestinians
are among the most vocal in support of Saddam Hussein for
standing up for Arab interests.
   "Here we are blaming him for listening to his
constituency," says Richard Murphy, a former Mideast envoy
for President Reagan. "The king has opened up politically and
he has to watch his step politically for internal reasons."
   King Hussein himself has helped create broad public
sympathy in Jordan for Iraq and for Saddam Hussein. Jordan
sided strongly with Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran.
Now Saddam Hussein is viewed as a kind of folk hero among
many Jordanians -- particularly among the heavy Palestinian
population in Jordan, which considers him an Arab leader with
the will to solve the Palestinian plight.
   Either now or later, Jordan also must fear retaliation
from powerful Iraq if it turns against Saddam Hussein.
   Some trade leakage through Jordan was evident yesterday.
An Associated Press photographer observed oil-carrying trucks
crossing the border into Jordan every three or four minutes,
although trucks could transport only a small fraction of
Iraq's production capacity.
   To the delight of U.S. officials, Aqaba, a seaport through
which Jordan ships vital goods, had grown quiet yesterday.
According to Pentagon officials, the U.S. Navy was closely
watching traffic into the seaport and observed that it had
dropped off sharply in the past few days. A few cargo vessels
appeared to be waiting outside the port for further
instructions from their owners.
   The Navy was also in a kind of waiting game. "No commander
is going to take action until clear-cut guidelines are sent
from Washington," said one official, who asked not to be
identified.
   Even a partial blockade of Jordan's export-import traffic
could be devastating, according to those familiar with that
country's fragile economy. "Forty-five percent of Jordan's
trade, in terms of hard currencies, comes from Iraq," says
Jean AbiNader, president of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of
Commerce, a Washington-based association of U.S. companies
that do business in the Arab world.
   During the past ten years, he explains, Jordan's economy
has become closely tuned to Iraq's needs, primarily because
of the Iraq-Iran war, which left the overland route to Aqaba
as Iraq's major supply line. By itself, Mr. AbiNader says,
Jordan has only tourism, the sale of potash and remittances
from Jordanians working abroad on which to rely. Iraq's need
for an export-import pipeline, he says, provided Jordan with
a new financial base in which it has come to depend.
   Mr. AbiNader worries that if the U.S. insists on a total
embargo including food and medicine it could "react
negatively against the U.S." The U.S., he says, "has taken a
tougher line than is necessary to maintain international
support."
   He and other Arab-Americans fret that any false step by
King Hussein in his diplomatic effort, one that could make
him appear too pro-U.S. or too pro-Iraqi, could mean his
downfall in a country already roiled by partisan and ethnic
strife.
   James Zogby, director of the Arab-American Institute, a
Washington-based advocacy group, notes that Jordan, along
with Kuwait, are the most democracy-prone Arab nations. "The
tragedy here is that the two countries that have provided the
most pluralism and the most internal debate are the two chief
victims of this process."
