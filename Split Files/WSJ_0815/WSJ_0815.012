   PITTSBURGH -- Paul B. Kazarian has been working
tenaciously the last 13 months to become chairman of
Allegheny International Inc.
   Today, he may finally realize his goal. But some might
wonder whether the unrelenting dogfight was worth it.

   The object of his desires, Allegheny is a shell of its
former self. It has spent the last 2 1/2 years trying to
resolve contentious and protracted bankruptcy proceedings.
The process, expected to close today after nearly a dozen
false starts, has battered the company's crown jewels,
appliance makers Sunbeam and Oster.
   Competitors snatched away market share and losses widened
while management was hamstrung by the bankruptcy proceedings
and distracted fending off, among others, Mr. Kazarian and
partner Michael Lederman, a director of the new company. And
uncertainty about who would end up owning Allegheny damped
employee morale and left retailers anxious.
   No one knows better than Mr. Kazarian, who through his
Japonica Partners began acquiring Allegheny's bankruptcy
claims at the beginning of the year. The executive, a former
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. investment banker, spent much of the
last year poring over the company's financial records and
market data, visiting plants and warehouses and meeting with
employees.
   And he's convinced that the new company, Sunbeam/Oster
Corp., will be a winner. The brash, 34-year-old executive,
who prefers baseball hats to ties, calls the old Allegheny a
"phenomenal business."
   Sunbeam and Oster, he says, are still respected brand
names and dominant in certain markets such as food processors
and hand mixers. Those appliances, along with gas grills,
electric blankets and lawn furniture operations, generate $80
million to $100 million in cash flow a year. They also
displayed remarkable resiliency in the face of a bitter
bankruptcy. Indeed, retailers and distributors say the only
problem of late is getting enough product.
   A strategic priority, Mr. Kazarian says, will be to spread
the Oster and Sunbeam brand names globally. "The managers and
presidents are like racehorses in the starting block," he
says. "They're saying we've got a great product. We have to
give them money to communicate that." He plans on using some
of the $300 million in fresh equity to tap the European
market.
   Mr. Kazarian and his new management team may have their
work cut out for them, though. Analyst Gregory Drahuschak of
Butcher &amp; Singer Inc. says the new company needs to restore
the luster to the Sunbeam brand name, which hasn't been
heavily promoted in recent years and has lost some of its
quality reputation. "It would be a mistake to cut costs by
slashing advertising," he says. "He needs to win back market
share and competitors won't let it go without a fight."
   If nothing else, Mr. Kazarian has done his homework,
associates say. "He's not a powder puff," asserts former
Allegheny director Joshua Angel. "If he brings the same sense
of purpose to running the company as he did to acquiring it,
my guess is he will be a success."
   Adds Melvin Gardner, another former Allegheny director:
"These guys are entrepreneurs who have their money at stake.
That's very important."
   Mr. Kazarian says he won't be involved in the daily
operations. While the Pittsburgh headquarters staff will be
largely dismissed, presidents of the two main operating units
-- home appliances and seasonal products such as lawn
furniture -- will remain and report directly to Mr. Kazarian.
He believes in employee ownership and as such said all
employees will have a chance to buy equity in the company,
which is expected to be 90%-owned by Japonica.
   The new chairman is a clear departure from the more staid
style of Oliver S. Travers, Allegheny's silver-haired
chairman known for his gentlemanly manner. Mr. Kazarian "has
a relatively informal style," says Herbert P. Minkel Jr., who
represented Japonica in the bankruptcy proceedings. "Paul
gets a certain amount of pleasure out of making life a little
uncomfortable for members of the establishment."
   After accumulating a 50% interest in Allegheny, the group
demanded Mr. Travers's resignation in June, a move which so
incensed the company that it kicked Japonica out of company
headquarters where the group was studying the company's
books.
   Yet while informal, associates say Mr. Kazarian is a
stickler for detail. "He plans things down to the hour. When
you work with Paul you know exactly what you have to deliver
and when," says Mr. Minkel.
   Being an outsider with a fresh outlook and unencumbered by
industry conventions may be a plus for Mr. Kazarian and the
company.
   But it also means he has to convince nervous retailer and
skeptical employees that he's interested in a long-term
relationship and not a fast buck. One show of his commitment:
not only is he keeping the company's lean headquarters in
Pittsburgh, but he, his wife and four children are moving
there from New York.
