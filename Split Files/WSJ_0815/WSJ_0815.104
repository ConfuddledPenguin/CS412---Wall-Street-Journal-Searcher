   A group of investors that includes Financial Securities
Advisers Inc. and Bailey Financial Group Inc. said it plans
to propose that Durham Corp. solicit offers for the sale of
the firm or a merger.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group
said it also asked Durham to consider increasing the number
of its directors to 18 and elect B.W. Landstreet III to fill
the spot that would be created. The group also proposed that
J.C.D. Bailey be elected a director if holders vote to amend
company bylaws to allow for more than 18 directors. The group
said it holds a stake of about 5.8% in Durham.

   In April, Raleigh, N.C.-based Durham, a life insurance
holding company, rejected a proposal by the group to acquire
all of its shares for $30 a share and subordinated debentures
valued at $7.50 a share. Officials of Durham couldn't be
reached for comment yesterday.
