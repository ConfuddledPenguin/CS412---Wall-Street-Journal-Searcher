   Duracell Holdings Corp., the battery producer taken
private in a June 1988 leveraged buy-out, reported earnings
of $6 million for the year ended June 30 compared with a
year-ago loss of $106 million.
   Operating cash flow -- earnings from operations plus
depreciation and amortization -- advanced 18% to $306 million
from $260 million. Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., reported
sales climbed 6.8% to $1.33 billion from $1.25 billion.

   Duracell had been a part of Kraft Inc., which now is part
of Philip Morris Cos., the giant New York foods, tobacco and
brewing concern.
   Sales in the U.S, and Europe were particularly strong, and
consumers continue to move to alkaline batteries, Duracell's
specialty, from zinc-carbon batteries, a spokesman said.
