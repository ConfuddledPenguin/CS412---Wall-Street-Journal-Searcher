   NEW YORK -- The stock market's drop this month is boosting
the number of margin calls as brokers demand additional
collateral from their customers who buy stocks on credit.
   But brokers say they are finding the latest ripple of
margin calls far less worrisome than the tidal wave unleashed
by the 1987 crash or even last October's 190-point dive.

   Thousands of small investors who bought stock on margin --
using money borrowed from their brokerage firms -- have had
to pony up additional collateral in recent days. Roiled by
soaring oil prices since the Kuwait invasion, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average this month has plunged about 157 points.
   Buying securities on margin is done only through brokerage
accounts. Technically, margin is the amount of cash put up
and amounts to at least 50% of a stock's purchase price. When
an investor's equity -- the current stock price minus the
loan amount -- drops to 25% to 30% of the stock price, he
will get a margin call requiring the deposit of more cash or
securities with the broker.
   "Whenever you get a drop in the stock market as steep as"
last week's, "you will get an increase in margin calls," says
Howard L. Clark Jr., chairman of American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., one of the nation's
major brokerage firms. "However, I can say that we are
well-collateralized and we have minimal exposure as the
result of the increase."
   A surge in margin calls can be dangerous for Wall Street.
In rapid declines, investors can run out of money, causing
the brokerage firm to get stuck with losses of its own as it
sells the stocks of customers who can't meet calls. Some
brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab Corp., incurred
major losses after the 1987 crash when clients failed to meet
margin calls.
   But there don't seem to be any margin-call disasters this
time around, say executives at Shearson, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
and other major brokerage firms. Schwab, a San Francisco
discount broker, reports that this time there hasn't been
"anything not normal" on the margin front. Schwab say that's
partly due to its stricter margin requirements since the
crash, but also because cautious investors continue to keep
record levels of cash on hand.
   Another help, say the brokerage firms, is that the market
has had some modest rebounds in the days after its big
Mideast-related plunges. Most important, brokerage firms seem
to have stepped up efforts to monitor potential trouble in
clients' accounts after the difficulties of October 1987 and
1989.
   Unlike those two earlier times, margin calls now are
"almost a non-event," says James Cayne, president of the Bear
Stearns Cos. brokerage firm. "Maybe brokers were better as
far as being on top of it. Maybe brokers who had experienced
the `minicrash' saw what was happening" last week and headed
off problems, Mr. Cayne says.
