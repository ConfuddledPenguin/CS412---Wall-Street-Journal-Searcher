   Extra oil from two major producers that the U.S. was
counting on to help shelter world petroleum markets from a
supply crunch has failed to materialize as anticipated.
   In a surprising turn, Venezuela backed off from earlier
indications to Vice President Dan Quayle that it would
increase exports by several hundred thousand barrels a day.

   Saudi Arabia, also expected to help offset the loss of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude caused by the Mideast crisis, still
hasn't increased output by any substantial amount. The
kingdom remains committed to such a step and is studying it,
Saudi officials said yesterday.
   The reluctance of the two countries to export more oil
right now reflects their fear that doing so might permanently
undermine the integrity of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, already weakened by the hostilities
between Iraq and Kuwait. These four countries, plus Iran, are
OPEC's founders. In fact, yesterday Iran sharply criticized
the notion of any unilateral production increases.
   In Caracas, Venezuelan government officials said output
would be kept within Venezuela's OPEC quota of 1.9 million
barrels a day unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to a new "concerted and coordinated effort"
to increase oil supplies.
   President Bush indicated at a news conference late
yesterday that he still expects an increase after talking by
phone with Venezuela's president. "I called him to thank him
for what I understood was a Venezuelan willingness to step up
and increase production -- they can still do it at a
reasonably efficient rate, I'm told -- and to thank him for
his approach on this," Mr. Bush said. "He told me that he'd
sent his foreign minister to various capitals to coordinate
all of this."
   The Venezuelan retrenchment shocked U.S. oil industry
officials -- as well as officials of Venezuela's national oil
company. Officials of Petroleos de Venezuela confirmed that
they had already increased oil production by between 100,000
and 200,000 barrels a day in the last few days on the
understanding they could sell more than the OPEC quota. The
oil, however, was stored and not shipped.
   "Venezuela has gone back on its commitment to increase
production," said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice
president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "And
this pushes up the time frame when the U.S. has to come to a
decision on its {strategic} petroleum reserve."
   His comments echo those of oil industry officials,
including the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,
who are pushing the U.S. government to begin drawing supplies
quickly from the strategic reserve. They insist that this is
necessary to help offset the recent disappearance from the
market of some four million barrels a day of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude.
   The oil companies are concerned about the supply
situation, the price runups that can occur on hints of
shortages and the possible blame that falls on them as prices
rise.
   The reserve currently holds just under 600 million
barrels, but the Bush administration has indicated it doesn't
think releasing its oil into the marketplace is warranted
yet.
   Many oil companies expected substantial additional
supplies of oil from both Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to be on
the way by now. The companies had requested extra barrels
from those producers just in recent days after President Bush
had said both promised increases in output.
   Yesterday, the oil companies still were waiting for word
they would get the oil. "Communications have taken place with
Saudi Arabia and with Petroleos de Venezuela relative to
increased supplies, but there has been no confirmation," said
an official of a major oil company that previously had been
buying oil from Iraq.
   It is understood that Saudi officials this week are
considering the "nominations" for more petroleum -- as such
purchaser requests are known -- including one from Kuwait
Petroleum Co., the Kuwaiti national oil company that is
continuing to operate in exile from Britain. It previously
supplied its European refining and marketing network from its
own nation's oil output.
   Saudi Arabia is moving cautiously, oil experts say,
because it must consider the politics of its region as well
as pure petroleum economics. The Saudis want a stable oil
market, however, and once they take action, it is assumed
they could replace as much as half -- or two million barrels
a day -- of the lost Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.
   Although Venezuela doesn't have as much spare capacity,
extra output by it could make an especially big difference to
U.S. oil supplies. For the U.S., Venezuelan oil is known as a
"short-haul" crude, only six days away by tanker from its
main customers, American oil companies. Transport time for a
tanker from the Mideast is about 30 days.
   Complicating the picture in Venezuela apparently is an
oil-policy disagreement within the government. On one side is
the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, which is
willing, even eager, to produce as much as it can sell and
has even suggested Venezuela pull out of OPEC. On the other
is the government oil ministry, which wants Venezuela to
maintain good relations with others in the organization it
helped found.
   So far OPEC politics is the overriding factor. "We are
willing to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, if
it's a concerted effort in OPEC, but we would like to have a
consensus first," a petroleum ministry official said in
Caracas.
   Another government official said that the president of
Venezuela had been willing to increase production in the
immediate aftermath of the Iraqi invasion but that "the
reaction was so strong from the other ministers {in OPEC}
that the order was rescinded."
   This official said Venezuela's oil minister now is
requesting an emergency session of OPEC to consider a
coordinated effort. "Venezuela, which does not wish to raise
production unilaterally, has joined Saudi Arabia in asking
for a meeting as soon as possible," he said.
   The Saudis and the Venezuelans haven't gotten much support
yet in their call for a meeting. Few OPEC oil ministers want
to renew the kind of wrenching debate they had in late July
when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was threatening Kuwait
while demanding a $7-a-barrel increase in OPEC's "reference,"
or target, price.
   This time, many ministers worry, OPEC would be even more
seriously split between those backing Iraq, which strongly
objects to any changes in the July agreement, and those
supporting Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The debate over who
would represent Kuwait would also be bitter.
   Iraq renewed its warnings yesterday against any OPEC
nations planning to increase output to replace its blocked
supplies. At a Caracas news conference, the Iraqi ambassador
to Venezuela said "those who take action against us will
suffer damage." He did not say what sort of retaliation Iraq
had in mind.
   Some people within OPEC expressed hope that any meeting
might be unnecessary within a few days. They weren't
specific, but yesterday it was announced that Jordan's King
Hussein, who has been trying to act as an intermediary in the
crisis, will meet with President Bush carrying a message from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Many OPEC ministers also endorse the view of Sadek
Boussena, OPEC president and Algeria's oil minister, that
world oil supplies remain ample. The oil glut so widely
publicized until the Aug. 2 invasion hasn't gone away, they
noted.
   "Big oil companies in the world intend to harm OPEC by
taking advantage of the current situation," Iran's President
Ali Akbar Rafsanjani said, according to the official Iranian
news agency. "OPEC members equally have no right to commit
treachery against their people in favor of the global oil
devourers," Mr. Rafsanjani added. He was speaking after
receiving Venezuela's foreign minister, who delivered a
message from the Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez.
   Still, several OPEC countries capable of increasing
production are doing so. These are Nigeria, Indonesia and
Libya -- and Iran.
   Monitors of OPEC production, including Cristina Haus of
Energy Security Analysis Inc. and the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation's Mr. Goldstein, place Iran's output at
around 3.2 million barrels a day, slightly above its OPEC
quota of 3.1 million. In addition, Iran has been speedily
unloading unsold oil it had sitting in Europe before the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out.
   According to London-based traders, Iran had eight very
large crude carriers parked offshore Northwest Europe -- each
holding about 1.6 million barrels of crude -- and an
equivalent amount stored onshore until the crisis. All that
has been sold within the past few days, at the sharply higher
prices in effect this month.
   Nonetheless, said Mr. Goldstein, world oil supplies are
taking a fresh jolt from the latest developments. "We have
now lost the equivalent of 90 million barrels in the matter
of August oil supplies that we thought would be available,"
he said.
