   Despite better medical treatment to fight life-threatening
infections, a study confirmed that long-term AIDS survivors
face increased risk of developing lymph cancer.
   In the first study published on the problem, reported
earlier this year, scientists at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that eight of 55 patients,
or almost 15%, developed an aggressive lymphoma following
about two years of therapy with the anti-viral drug AZT.

   After three years of AZT treatment, the risk of developing
such cancer may exceed 46%, making lymphoma "a formidable
complication" of the AIDS epidemic now entering its second
decade, wrote the lead author of the report, Dr. James Pluda
of the NCI. The study is published in today's issue of the
Annals of Internal Medicine.
   In Research Triangle Park, N.C., a spokeswoman for the
drug's manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co., a unit of
Wellcome PLC of London, said that "nothing in the clinical
trials suggests that the rate of lymphoma was any different
in AZT recipients than in the control group" who received a
placebo, or sugar pill. Moreover, she said, "AIDS patients
are generally at risk for lymphoma."
   Many experts emphasized that the syndrome is evolving, and
presenting new challenges to researchers and clinicians
alike.
   Laurence Kaplan of San Francisco General Hospital, who saw
four new cases of lymphoma yesterday alone, said the new
manifestations of AIDS arise because "We're seeing people
living longer."
   "As therapies are developed, we can expect to see a
changing face of AIDS," added Clifford Lane, an AIDS
researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. "As we develop treatments for one
complication, another complication arises."
   While the precise cause of the cancer remains a mystery,
scientists at NCI and elsewhere currently are investigating
the potential role of AZT, earlier linked to vaginal tumors
in laboratory animals. Doctors also have noted genetic
abnormalities, specifically changes in chromosome numbers 8
and 14, affecting as many as 85% of such AIDS lymphoma
patients, according to Jerome Groopman of the New England
Deaconess Hospital, who has seen 40 cases of lymphoma in his
clinic in the past year.
   Further, a majority of such patients show high activity of
a cancer-causing gene, or oncogene, named "myc", Dr. Groopman
adds. Finally, up to half such AIDS lymphomas show signs of a
second virus, Epstein-Barr virus, long ago implicated in
Burkitt's lymphoma, a variety of lymphoma that is prevalent
in Africa.
   The surge in AIDS-related lymphoma isn't occuring in a
vaccuum, however, as the disease is generally on the rise.
For unknown reasons, the incidence of lymphoma in the U.S.
has increased 50% since 1973, NCI surveillance studies have
reported.
   Especially vulnerable is anyone with weakened immunity,
including patients with hereditary immune deficiencies, and
organ transplant recipients, as well as people with AIDS.
This type of cancer, formally known as non-Hodgkins lymphoma,
is a malignancy of B-cells, the antibody-producing white
blood cells, which proliferate wildly in AIDS patients even
as their immune defenses erode.
   For this reason, the authors of the report strongly
suggest that longer-term AIDS survivors are at greater risk
of lymphoma because they live longer with severely weakened
immunity, giving cancer an open door into the system. Indeed,
the people in the study group were profoundly immune
suppressed, with levels of infection-fighting T4 cells below
50 per cubic millimeter for more than a year preceding the
onset of cancer. (Normal T4 cell counts generally are thought
to be at least 1,000 per cubic millimeter.)
   "However, a direct role of therapy itself cannot be
totally discounted," the report acknowledges. Not just AZT,
but other potent drugs used in treating the complications of
AIDS, may contribute to genetic mutations that lead to
cancer. These include DHPG and trimethoprim sulfa, according
Dr. Groopman, who adds, "We need a lot of lab study to learn
how lymphoma arises in a setting of immune deficiency."
   In the future, combination therapies, or treatment
regimens that include biological agents to bolster the immune
system, may allay the plunge in T4 counts and gird AIDS
patients against such malignancies, said Samuel Broder, NCI
director and a co-author of the report. Discovering the
molecular basis of lymphoma, and finding better treatment for
it, are now "major priorities" of the institute, he added.
   But for now, neither the report's authors nor outside
experts are counseling any wholesale shift in AIDS treatment
strategy until much more is known. "AZT is clearly the drug
of choice for most AIDS patients. So I wouldn't change
anyone's medications at this point," said Dr. Groopman. "But
I would study AZT's role as a mutagen."
