   BEIJING -- Matthew Mouw, bedecked in a bright yellow
outfit plastered with the M&amp;Ms candy logo, zips along
Beijing's boulevards on his 21-speed bike.
   Every few blocks, he stops at a drab state-owned shop to
cajole clerks into peddling M&amp;Ms. He tries to lure them with
a promotional display that features Pan Pan, the panda mascot
of the next week's Asian Games, running through a soccer
stadium filled with M&amp;Ms.

   "My job is to cheer people up and make the Asian Games fun
because M&amp;Ms is a fun product," says Mr. Mouw, a 29-year-old
promoter for Mars Inc. of McClean, Va., an Asian Games
sponsor.
   Despite Mr. Mouw's attempts to stir up excitement, most of
Beijing's population of 11 million seem more in the mood for
a funeral than a festival.
   What was supposed to be China's day in the sun can't
escape the cloud of the June 4, 1989, massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators. "People have mixed feelings
about the Asian Games," says a 26-year-old railway worker.
"It's good for China if the games are a success, but this
would also give credibility to the government leaders -- and
many people can't stand the thought of that."
   The Tiananmen Square massacre has put the Asian Games in a
financial bind. The government had budgeted $125 million, or
one-quarter of the games' cost, to be paid by commercial
sponsorships, with any shortfall to be made up with voluntary
donations. The remaining $415 million is being paid by the
government through deficit spending.
   But only about a dozen foreign companies have signed up,
and it appears that all of them signed contracts prior to the
Tiananmen crackdown. It also appears that only a fraction of
the hoped-for money from foreign sponsors has materialized.
So the government has resorted to pressuring state-run
industries and Beijing's workers.
   When the Asian Games were being planned in the mid-1980s,
China saw the event as a prelude to its getting the Olympic
Games in 2000. Advertisers were expected to clamor for the
chance to rent stadium billboards, launch balloons and paste
their names across athletes' uniforms.
   On Sept. 22, as many as 100,000 tourists and 2,000 foreign
journalists from 38 participating countries are expected in
Beijing for the quadrennial event. The games will be
broadcast live to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and
Singapore as well as the oil shiekdoms of the Middle East.
   As a result, the games provide foreign companies a chance
for high-profile exposure of their brand names in consumer
markets that are often either too expensive, or too closed,
to reach through domestic advertising.
   Games organizers are embarrassed about the lack of foreign
support, so they refuse to release any details about
commercial sponsorship. The foreign sponsors are forbidden by
their contracts from disclosing the prices they paid.
   But from documents obtained privately, it appears that
Asian Games organizers collected between $20 million to $30
million from foreign commercial sponsors. Only 230 of the
1,755 stadium advertising billboards were leased by foreign
sponsors. The rest were given away at fire-sale prices to
state industries.
   "No sponsor who had signed a deal backed off. Everybody
considered the June 4 event, but it was impossible to back
out," says a foreign sponsor who requests anonymity. Backing
out would have angered the Chinese and put at risk a
corporation's chances at future business in China.
   The major sponsors of the games include Konica Corp. and
Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan, Samsung Co. and Goldstar Co. of
South Korea, Mars, Coca-Cola Co., and American Express Co. of
the U.S. and Adidas AG of West Germany.
   To please these companies, Beijing authorities have bent
over backwards. Until recently, the most prominent signs in
Beijing carried such messages as "Happily, happily go to
work, safely, safely return home." Now the city is ablaze
with "Melts In Your Mouth, Not In Your Hand." Additionally,
companies such as Mars have parlayed Asian Games sponsorship
into permission to begin selling their products in local
stores, thereby giving them a crack at China's gargantuan
consumer market of 1.2 billion.
   The huge shortfall is being squeezed from the pockets of
workers and coffers of state factories. Several dozen state
factories have become major Asian Games sponsors at a time
when about one-third of the central government spending is
earmarked for subsidies to state industries.
   Beijing's workers, who average $330 in annual wages, are
seeing their paychecks docked by 20% or more for Asian Games
"donations." Teachers are soliciting money from
schoolchildren. Local companies connected with foreign
businesses are given a 10% commission on donations they
extract from their foreign partners.
   "The pressure is very strong because the more you give the
more you prove your loyalty to the government," says a
37-year-old Chinese office worker.
   Asian Games officials say that all donations are supposed
to be voluntary. They add that they have no control over
fundraising techniques. "This is fund raising with Chinese
characteristics," says Wang Zhiliang, director of games fund
raising.
   Meanwhile, state media outlets are doing their best to
create an air of enthusiasm. Beijing newspapers report that
due to Asian Games-spirit, a 100-day campaign by the masses
has come close to eradicating Beijing's flies, mosquitoes,
rats and cockroaches.
   The city's 30,000 public toilet cleaners are so enthused,
according to one report, that they've picked up 560,000 tons
of sewage in the past month, a 20% increase from a year ago.
But newspapers admit that a few aren't cooperating. Among
them are five farmers on the outskirts of Beijing who were
arrested after they used homemade rifles to shoot down
carrier pigeons being trained for the festivities.
   The most noticeable byproduct of the games is tight
security. Armed police man late-night roadblocks.
Plainclothes cops roam the streets by day. Mentally ill
people and peasants who've come to Beijing seeking work, both
"major elements of instability," are being carted away.
   "The government is desperately worried that something will
happen again, but that is unlikely," says a foreign diplomat.
"People know this isn't the big one, the big one will be when
somebody dies," he adds, referring to the possibility that
one of China's aged top leaders will soon die.
   The games organizers admit that last year's
"counterrevolutionary rebellion" has caused difficulties. But
they say that if the Asian Games are free of major blunders
or violent incidents, the outside world will realize that
China is now stable. And this, the organizers say, will lure
foreign tourists back and help China get the Olympics in the
year 2000.
   "This is a chance for us to make friends with the world
again," says Wu Zhongyuan, spokesman for the Asian Games.
