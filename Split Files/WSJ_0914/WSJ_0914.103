   NEW YORK -- Three major exchanges, concluding a yearlong
investigation into alleged program-trading abuses, have found
no evidence of large-scale illicit activity, according to
people familiar with the exchanges' efforts.
   The detailed probe covers several volatile trading days in
1989 and 1990. People familiar with the investigation, which
is in its final stages, say the exchanges aren't willing to
say manipulative program trading has never occurred. But
allegations of frequent, orchestrated abuses couldn't be
supported by the inquiry, they say.

   The investigation is a joint effort by the New York Stock
Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   In program trading, brokers rapidly buy and sell big
baskets of stocks, futures and options to lock in fleeting
price differences. Ever since the 1987 stock market crash,
many investors have claimed that manipulative program trading
was a major cause of big stock-market price swings.
   Critics also have charged that big Wall Street securities
firms were conspiring to move markets for illicit
self-enrichment using computerized trading strategies.
   The three exchanges are looking for examples of customer
front-running, where brokers would trade ahead of large
customer orders that were bound to have a market impact.
   They are also inspecting trading records for examples of
self front-running, where brokers would try to create a
volatile move in underlying stocks, for example, to increase
the value of their trades in corresponding options or futures
markets.
   But investigators "are not finding anything that remotely
looks like large-scale customer front-running," said one
person familiar with the exchanges' efforts. "They are
covering every single trade of significant size. There is no
indication of self front-running either," the individual
said.
   The three exchanges have been swapping detailed trading
records since the fall of 1989 to reconstruct simultaneous
trades in stocks, stock-index futures and options by big
brokerage firms on 12 volatile days from July 1989 through
January 1990. The exchange's efforts have been closely
followed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Spokesmen for the Big Board and the Chicago Merc declined
to comment yesterday. A spokesman for the CBOT said the
investigation has not been concluded.
   The lack of hard evidence of concerted manipulation is
likely to confound a vocal anti-program trading faction on
Wall Street and many lawmakers in Washington.
   "Program {traders} are aware of the laws and are extremely
cautious," said Thomas A. Russo, veteran securities attorney
at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. "Everybody knows that
front-running is a politicized issue," he said. "I am not
sure it's a big problem {in the market}, but it's a sexy
problem for people in the public eye."
   Allegations about program-trading manipulation reached a
fever pitch last May when James Coxon, chairman of the
investment policy committee at Cigna Corp., a big insurer,
alleged that a program-trading "club" was working on Wall
Street to roil the markets and share information. Mr. Coxon's
remarks were made before a congressional panel.
   To date, the only serious penalty by an exchange against a
program-trading firm was brought by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange against Susquehanna Investment Group for alleged
abusive trading in the stock and stock-options markets.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Susquehanna
submitted to a $170,000 fine by the CBOE.
   Some program traders say that they have been made
scapegoats for Wall Street's larger problems. Stockbrokers
use "program trading as a convenient whipping boy" for the
retreat of the small investor from the stock market, said J.
Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management, a
Pittsburgh-based investment firm.
   Mr. Allen said that some program-trading critics have a
witch-hunt mentality. Among them, "the perception is that if
we can find the villain and kill it, then the retail investor
will be back in droves and generate that engine called
commissions."
   Now the debate may swing toward what many market observers
think is a more central problem: The difficulties U.S.
markets are having handling intensified trading demands from
large institutions, often on days when market-moving news
breaks and big investors need to trade quickly and easily.
   Such "liquidity" and market structure questions were
treated in three of eight recommendations made in June by a
special Big Board committee on market volatility.
   According to some committee members, there was an effort
by exchanges to have the group's report state that there was
no evidence that manipulation on certain days was a cause of
stock-market volatility.
   "There was an attempt to make the document reassuring to
the public that there was no conspiracy going on," said
Stephen Timbers, a panel member and chief investment officer
at Kemper Financial Services.
   However, some committee members, including Frederick L.A.
Grauer, chairman of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors,
said they preferred to allow the exchanges to complete their
investigation, rather than endorsing what were then
preliminary, superficial conclusions.
   "We didn't want to whitewash it," said panel member James
Cloonan, chairman of the American Association of Individual
Investors.
   Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors is one of Wall
Street's big program trading customers, with $1.2 billion
committed to stock-index arbitrage strategies.
   Reached in Japan, Mr. Grauer said, "To the extent that
{manipulation} is not there, it is a positive development for
market participants. It may serve to refocus the debate on
the origins of volatility."
   However, Mr. Grauer, like the exchanges, was reluctant to
say that program trading abuses never occur. "The ability to
audit is quite limited. You are getting sample points and
making generalizations," he said. If the exchanges find the
records clean on the specific days under study, "I give the
market a clean bill of health -- on those 12 days," he said.
