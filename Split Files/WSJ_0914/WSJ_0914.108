   It is unfortunate that the last thing Stephen Friedman of
Goldman Sachs expressed (Money &amp; Investing, Aug. 15) was a
seeming reluctance to examine speculative investment
opportunities in Eastern Europe. True, there are awesome
barriers, from the want of standard accounting systems to the
lack of a modern stock exchange and convertible currencies.
   Eastern Europe, however, is an opportunity too good for
even the conservative Goldman Sachs to pass up. It includes
about 850 million literate, mostly educated people. It is
also an area that, through stronger ties with the Soviet
Union, could become self-sufficient in raw materials,
independent of the Persian Gulf. Eastern Europe is a growth
opportunity first, a highly speculative risk second.
