   LOS ANGELES -- The listless U.S. economy is already
slipping into a full-blown recession that will last for at
least six months, University of California at Los Angeles
business forecasters said.
   The UCLA Business Forecasting Project said it sees a
two-quarter decline in the nation's gross national product,
beginning in the fourth quarter. "Should the predicted
declines occur, it will likely be deemed that the recession
began before the fourth quarter because of the profound
weakness exhibited by the economy during the past few
months," said David G. Hensley, acting director of the
forecast.

   UCLA forecasters at the Anderson Graduate School of
Management predict that real GNP will decline at an annual
rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter and 3.2% in the first
quarter of 1991.
   The recession forecast is in line with that of many other
economists and forecasters. Blue Chip Economic Indicators
Inc., a Sedona, Ariz., firm that polls 50 economists each
month on their economic forecasts, said that 50% of
economists in a Sept. 10 poll predicted a recession that
would begin in the fourth quarter.
   The UCLA forecast is based on the assumption that a
diplomatic solution will be found to the Persian Gulf crisis.
Should a war begin, higher oil prices could deepen the
downturn, the economists said.
   The UCLA economists see a slow growth in consumer spending
in 1990, 1991 and 1992. Interest rates will begin to drop
this fall in response to the deteriorating economy, Mr.
Hensley said. By mid-1991, the federal funds rate will drop
below 6%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate banks
charge each other on overnight loans to meet the daily
reserve requirement.
   Racked by a softening real estate market and defense and
construction layoffs, California will join the national
economy in recession, Mr. Hensley said. "Although the
California economy is currently performing better than the
national economy, there are abundant signs that growth is
slowing," he added.
   Real gross state product for California is predicted to
grow 1.3% this year, followed by projected gains of 0.6% in
1991, 4.8% in 1992 and 2.1% in 1993, he said.
   The slide in California home construction continues, Mr.
Hensley said, with single-family housing starts currently off
33% from last fall. Home prices increases are expected to be
minimal through 1993, certainly below the rate of consumer
price inflation, he said.
   Meanwhile, construction and defense jobs will continue to
be cut, he said.
