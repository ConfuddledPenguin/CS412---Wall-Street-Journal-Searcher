   Houston businessman George Aubin, a borrower and principal
at several failed Texas thrifts, has been sued in connection
with $40 million in losses at the defunct Western Savings
Association of Dallas.
   The lawsuit, filed earlier this week in federal court in
Dallas, accuses Mr. Aubin of using $14.2 million in proceeds
from a Western loan to purchase a Kentucky horse farm. The
entire loan was supposed to finance the purchase of a tract
of land in North Dallas.

   The suit was filed by Sunbelt Savings FSB, which took over
Western's assets in August 1988, about two years after
Western's failure. The suit is one of at least three pending
against Mr. Aubin in connection with losses at Texas thrifts,
and he is among the targets of a federal criminal
investigation into the failures of two thrifts. Neither Mr.
Aubin nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.
   The suit filed this week is based on a $29 million loan
that Mr. Aubin and his partners obtained from Western in 1984
for the purported purchase of a tract of land in north
Dallas. The suit alleges that the loan amount was inflated by
a fraudulent land appraisal, enabling Mr. Aubin to siphon off
$14.2 million for the purchase of the horse farm. Sunbelt
claims that Western's losses grew to $40 million through
other, unpaid loans for development of the Dallas property.
   Mr. Aubin was forced to seek the funds from Western
Savings after former Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner L.
Linton Bowman III blocked Mr. Aubin from obtaining any more
loans from two Houston-based thrifts, Mercury Savings
Association and Ben Milam Savings Association, according to
the lawsuit. State and federal thrift laws limit the amount
of loans from one institution to one borrower.
   A separate lawsuit, brought by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., alleges that the officers and directors of
Mercury and Ben Milam contributed to the failures of the
thrifts. That suit also alleges that Mr. Aubin controlled the
thrifts and their lending activities although he didn't serve
as either an officer or director of the institutions. The
suit is pending in federal court in Houston.
   Another lawsuit being pursued by the FDIC in federal court
in Houston seeks to collect about $16 million in unpaid loans
from Mercury and Ben Milam to Mr. Aubin and his companies,
according to an attorney working for the FDIC.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Houston is
conducting "an active investigation" of the failures of
Mercury and Ben Milam, according to the FBI agent in charge
of the probe. Mr. Aubin hasn't been charged with any criminal
activities in connection with the thrift failures.
