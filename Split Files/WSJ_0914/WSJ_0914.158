   The New York State Assembly's investigative unit rebuked
state regulators for inadequately examining alleged
wrongdoing in transactions between New York Telephone and
other Nynex Corp. units.
   A report released yesterday by Richard Brodsky, chairman
of the Assembly's Oversight, Analysis and Investigation
Committee, recommended that state regulators broaden their
investigation into New York Telephone. The report urged the
state Public Service Commission to examine individual
transactions between the phone company and other Nynex units
as well as all management, construction and engineering
contracts with affiliated companies.

   It further suggested that the Public Service Commission
begin civil penalty proceedings for alleged wrongdoing in New
York Telephone transactions with affiliates. That includes,
Mr. Brodsky said, any transactions arranged between
participants at annual gatherings in Florida, nicknamed
"pervert conventions," that were organized by an executive of
Nynex's purchasing arm. The parties included several
employees of Nynex, more than 30 suppliers, and prostitutes.
   New York Telephone is in the middle of a major rate case
in New York state. The company has asked for a rate increase
of about $825 million beginning in January, a figure that
some analysts say could rise beyond $1 billion after certain
adjustments are made in subsequent months.
   Assemblyman Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester, said the
committee inquiry into the Public Service Commission's
performance started eight months ago. That was after the
committee opposed a settlement agreement -- negotiated by the
phone company and the PSC staff -- that would have ended any
investigation into questionable transactions among Nynex
affiliates.
   A spokesman for New York Telephone said the report "fails
to recognize the thousands of pages of testimony and hundreds
of hours of direct questioning and cross examination" of
outside experts who found no overpayments that boosted phone
rates. Besides, he said, the phone company cut from the rate
case any "questionable amounts arising from allegations of
overpayments," and in March eliminated its purchasing unit's
independent status, making it part of New York Telephone and
New England Telephone.
   Peter Bradford, chairman of the PSC, said that although he
hadn't seen the committee report, New York Telephone
customers "are not paying and will not pay for alleged
improprieties." For the past five years, New York Telephone
has been operating under a rate moratorium. "Since our
investigation is far from over," he said, "it is hard for me
to imagine any valid critique of it at this point."
   But the report drew the endorsement ot the New York
attorney general's office, which has been highly critical of
the way the rate case has been handled. "We welcome the
findings and hope the PSC will pay attention," said Charlie
Donaldson, an assistant attorney general.
