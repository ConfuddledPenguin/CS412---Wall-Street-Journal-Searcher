   WASHINGTON -- In its struggle to sell billions of dollars
of leftover savings-and-loan assets, the S&amp;L cleanup agency
may have to loosen standards for government loans to buyers
of the properties.
   "Seller financing may have to be liberalized for some
kinds of real estate," Lamar Kelly, head of asset disposition
for the Resolution Trust Corp., told the Senate Banking
Committee. "If we don't, we won't be selling a whole lot of
raw land in Texas or vacant strip shopping centers."

   With nervous bankers clamping down on credit across the
country, a government loan may be the only way for some
would-be buyers to acquire the seized S&amp;L properties. But RTC
financing simply swaps one government asset for another: If
the loan goes bad, the government gets stuck again with the
old property.
   The RTC would like to consider providing more-exotic
government financing, such as junior and senior participation
in the loans in which only senior interests would be sold in
the secondary market, a spokesman said. The RTC could even
pay private banks fees for providing financing for RTC
purchases.
   Currently the RTC generally requires 15% down, depending
on the property, and the loan must be of sufficient quality
to be sold into the secondary market within a year. Under its
current rules, the RTC may approve as much as $1 billion in
government loans for buyers, though it has only about $50
million outstanding.
   The RTC currently holds $164 billion in assets. Its $31
billion in total sales so far consists mostly of securities
and up-to-date loans. Government financing most likely would
be for its more than 8,000 parcels of vacant land, valued at
about $7 billion.
   Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) warned the
RTC against an everything-must-go sales mentality to shrink
its real estate inventory. He suggested a land bank approach,
in which the government would hold vacant land, perhaps for
years, in hopes that real estate prices strengthen. If the
RTC sold land for 10 cents on the dollar, and a speculator
turned it at a huge profit, more than Mr. Kelly's reputation
as a regulator will be at risk, the senator said.
   "There will be a war party out looking for Mr. Kelly, and
they will hunt you down," Sen. Riegle said. "You'd better
weigh that carefully."
   The RTC also said it has now sold roughly $550 million of
its $3.7 billion in junk-bond holdings. Today is its deadline
for receiving proposals from investment bankers for managing
the portfolio, the RTC said. It expects to select an adviser
in two weeks.
