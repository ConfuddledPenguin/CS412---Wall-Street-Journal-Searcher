   Keithley Instruments Inc. said it agreed to market in
North America a line of measurement instruments produced by
NF Corp. of Japan that will complement its own devices.
   Keithley said the move not only represents a major
addition of product technology and potential sales volume,
but also is expected to increase its own sales of instruments
as well.
