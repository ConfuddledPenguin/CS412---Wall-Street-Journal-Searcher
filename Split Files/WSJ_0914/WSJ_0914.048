   RIJSWIJK, the Netherlands -- Talk about timing.
   Shell Pensioenfonds Beheer B.V. got permission from its
trustees to load up on equities shortly before Iraq's Saddam
Hussein threw the global stock market into confusion.

   "It's a roller coaster ride for shares at the moment,"
said Jan de Kreij, general manager of the fund, which manages
13 billion Dutch guilders ($7.36 billion) of investments for
Dutch employees of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Fortunately,
the fund didn't jump onto the roller coaster right away. Mr.
de Kreij said in an interview that the fund is sticking to
its long-term plan to raise the equity portion of its
portfolio to about 50% from 35%, but that it won't make any
big purchases until the Mideast situation becomes clearer.
   While the fund hasn't sold shares during the scare, it is
buying only in a selective way. For example, Mr. de Kreij
said, the fund recently bought a small amount of Japanese
technology shares, which he declined to identify. The fund
was already fairly heavy on oil shares, which are benefiting
from the surge in petroleum prices.
   Mr. de Kreij and his colleagues can hardly be accused of
impulsive investing. Their change in long-term strategy is
the result of nearly two years of study.
   The Shell fund is considered among the best-managed in the
Netherlands, rival managers said. Mr. de Kreij refused to
give figures comparing his team's performance with other
funds. But he noted that one gauge of performance is the
level of contributions that are needed from workers and the
company to meet the fund's liabilities. Because investment
returns have grown, the fund has been able to let
contributions decline in recent years to about 220 million
guilders in 1989 from 547 million guilders in 1985, even
though the fund's pension liabilities continued to rise.
   But Mr. de Kreij said the fund still believes it can
improve its performance and figures it will need more
investment income as its liabilities grow. (Under the Dutch
pension system, retirees typically receive 70% of their final
salary, with periodic adjustments to cover inflation.)
   Because shares tend to perform better than bonds and
property in the long term, the fund figured it should raise
the equity portion of its portfolio -- even though this would
mean more volatility. To test its hunch, the fund used market
data from the past 40 years to check how it would have
performed under various investment strategies. It found that,
indeed, the highest returns would have come from investing
100% in shares.
   But such a strategy would mean too much volatility, Mr. de
Kreij said. The level of pension contributions needed from
the company could vary wildly from year to year, making the
company's earnings performance choppier.
   So the fund managers decided it would be more prudent to
aim for a long-term average of about 50% shares, 30% property
and 20% bonds. The fund now is about 35% shares, 45% bonds
and 20% property.
   Even before the new strategy was adopted, Shell's fund
carried more equity than the typical pension fund in the
Netherlands, where it is common to keep 80% in bonds and
divide the rest between shares and property. That stance
partly reflects a cautious approach and partly the relatively
small size of the Dutch stock market, which limits equity
opportunities for funds that don't want to take currency
risks by investing abroad.
   British and U.S. funds tend to hold a higher proportion of
their assets in shares. Shell's new guideline puts it roughly
in line with the typical U.S. corporate pension fund. In a
1988 survey, the latest available, the U.S. consulting firm
Greenwich Associates found that American corporate funds held
an average of about 49% of their assets in shares.
   The same survey found that only about 1/10th of the U.S.
funds' equity investments were outside the U.S. By contrast,
Shell's new strategy increases the fund's limit on
investments outside the Netherlands to about 50% from 30%.
   As the Shell fund pays its retirees in guilders, currency
risks are a serious concern. But Mr. de Kreij figures the
problem is manageable, as long as the fund spreads its
investments in a variety of currencies to balance risks.
   In its equity investing, the Shell fund doesn't try to
pick a few hot stocks -- a course considered too risky and
unlikely to succeed over the long haul. Instead, it aims for
a broad spread of investments reflecting the entire economy.
"If you can outperform real growth in the economy, you should
be happy," Mr. de Kreij said.
