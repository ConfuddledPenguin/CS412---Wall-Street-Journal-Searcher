   CHICOUTIMI, Quebec -- Alcan Aluminium Ltd. expects
aluminum prices to stay firm and perhaps rise over the next
six months, said David Morton, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   "We won't see price declines," Mr. Morton said. "There is
a greater opportunity of upward movement."

   Speaking to reporters after officially opening a new
smelter here, Mr. Morton said Alcan may raise its current
price of 82 cents U.S. a pound beginning with October
shipments.
   Jacques Bougie, president and chief operating officer,
said Alcan's shipments of aluminum ingot and products in the
third quarter "will be at least equal" to second quarter
shipments of 581,000 metric tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.6
pounds.
   Alcan executives declined to comment directly on earnings.
But Mr. Morton said compared with the first six months "I
don't think things have changed dramatically in the second
half." In the half, Alcan had net income of $256 million, or
$1.09 a share.
