   PARIS (AP) -- France's major liquor manufacturers offered
to contribute millions of dollars to alcoholism prevention
programs if the government backed off a plan to prohibit
liquor ads.
   The companies also proposed the creation of a commission
representing the public and private sectors to regulate
liquor advertising.

   The proposals were drafted by a group of executives from
Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Pernod Ricard, Champagne de
Venoge, Martini &amp; Rossi France, Seagram France and other
companies.
   Thierry Mantoux, chief executive of Champagne de Venoge,
said the industry contribution would be in proportion to the
amount of money each company spent on advertising. He
predicted that tens of millions of francs would be generated
for alcoholism prevention.
   Parliament earlier this year approved a plan by Health
Minister Claude Evin to ban tobacco and alcohol advertising
starting in 1993.
