   In your July 25 story on agricultural price supports you
quote John Chafee saying that the honey price-support program
"has outlived its usefulness and benefits only 1% of the
nation's 210,000 beekeepers." Mr. Chafee's 1% figure may be
correct, but that 1% represents about 90% of all bee colonies
in the U.S. (the balance are hobbyists).
   What most people do not realize is that fully one-third of
all food consumed in the U.S. is directly or indirectly
dependent on honey bees for pollination. Think about it. What
would happen to this nation if one-third of all of its food
was to disappear tomorrow?

   I am not being an alarmist when I say that this is
entirely within the realm of possibility. The loss of price
supports, combined with the onslaught of varroa mites, will
wipe out the commercial beekeeping industry within the next
five years.
   Instead of cutting price supports, Congress should be
increasing spending on much needed research to eradicate the
mites that will have totally destroyed all wild honey bees
within the next five years. Why should we care? Wild honey
bees are responsible for 50% of all pollination in the U.S.
The mites are also a costly threat to commercial beekeepers,
with no solution in sight.
   At a current annual cost of only $15 million to $20
million, the honey price-support program is the equivalent of
only a couple dozen of the Pentagon's infamous hammers and
toilet seats. Yes, we can import honey for cheaper prices
(Third World countries harvest wild honey), but we cannot
import pollination, nor can we afford to import one-third of
all the food we eat.
