   BRITISH UNEMPLOYMENT

   British unemployment rose for the sixth month in a row in
August.
   Employment Minister Robert Jackson said the seasonally
adjusted jobless figure of 1.65 million -- 5.8% of the work
force compared with 5.7% in July -- was bad news, but higher
wage settlements could only make matters worse.
   Statistics from the Department of Employment showed
average earnings rose 10% on an annual basis in July, the
same as June but still higher than the Conservative
government's preferred level of around 9%. "The level of
unemployment is closely connected with the level of wage
settlements," Mr. Jackson said.
   "The current economic slowdown need not be translated into
high unemployment if wage negotiators pay heed to what can be
afforded," the minister said.
                                                                                                       

   MEGABUCKS FOR MEGA BORG
                                                                                                       

   The 15-year-old Norwegian supertanker Mega Borg, which
spilled tons of crude oil off Texas after exploding in June,
left owners with a windfall. Insurers, led by Norway's
Christiansans Skipassuranceforening, paid $24 million for the
wreck -- $7 million more than the estimated current value of
its identical sister ship, said the Oslo newspaper
Aftenposten. "Compared to other tanker projects since last
December, it has been a great investment. . . . there has
been a small profit for its owners," an official of Mosvold
Farsund AS, a 40% owner of Mega Borg, told Aftenposten.
                                                                                                       

   MATERNITY LEAVE IN THE EC

   Women would get a minimum 14 weeks maternity leave, with
full salary, if the European Community's latest "Social
Charter" measure is adopted. Most EC states already give
working mothers 14 weeks or more, but in many countries the
women can only draw 70% or 80% of their salary. The proposed
measure faces opposition from several countries worried about
rising labor costs.
                                                                                                       

   PROTECTING AUSTRALIA'S KOALAS
                                                                                                       

   Australian police began "fingerprinting" koalas to prevent
them being taken illegally from the wild and caged in tourist
nature parks. Frank Carrick of the University of Queensland
said police would fingerprint 65 koalas in captivity. He said
that although koala hands lack prints, their fingertips show
a pattern that researchers believe is as individual as human
fingerprints. Under the new system, wildlife rangers who
suspect a koala has been taken from the wild will check
whether its print is on record.
                                                                                                       

   SENTENCING IN SWITZERLAND
                                                                                                       

   A Swiss court sentenced two Lebanese brothers to 4 1/2
years in prison each for laundering millions of dollars
through Swiss accounts for Colombian drug barons. The court
also fined Jean and Barkev Magharian over $37,000 each but
gave them back most of $5 million that had been seized from
them. The affair, dubbed the "Lebanon Connection," has
attracted wide attention in Switzerland for bringing down
Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp after she tipped her husband
off in 1988 that a company he helped run was being
investigated in the probe.
                                                                                                       

   BARCLAY'S GERMAN VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   Barclays Bank PLC is creating a joint-venture
financial-services concern with West German retailer Hertie
Waren &amp; Kaufhaus G.m.b.H. to open outlets for its consumer
products in the German market, the bank said. Barclays said
the Frankfurt-based venture would operate out of Hertie's 62
department stores. It is expected to offer consumer loans and
to broker financial products designed specifically for the
German market.
                                                                                                       

   SWEDISH INFLATION
                                                                                                       

   The Swedish Price and Competition Office adjusted its
forecasts for the country's 1990 inflation rate to 10.7% from
a previous estimate of 10%.
   The adjustment followed the release of an 11.1% annual
increase and 0.7% monthly increase in the consumer price
index for August. Gasoline and heating oil accounted for 0.3
percentage point of the monthly rise.
   "After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, considerable
increases were recorded for the international prices of crude
oil and oil products," said Ambjorn Berglund, deputy head of
the price office. In view of that, he said, his agency "has
revised its inflation projection for 1990." Mr. Berglund
added that Sweden now has the highest inflation rate in
Europe.
   In January, the price office forecast an 8.6% rise for the
year. That projection was changed in May to 10%, after the
government announced a temporary increase in value-added tax
on consumer goods, bringing the total up to 25%, from 23.76%.
The extra tax is scheduled to be lifted in January 1993.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Cesar S.A. of Saumur, France, a leading maker of
caricature masks, is churning out scowling images of Iraq's
Saddam Hussein to hit the U.S. market in time for Halloween.
Expected retail price: $25. . . . Tens of thousands of Greeks
staged a 24-hour nationwide walkout yesterday, closing down
state-controlled banks, public transportation and the
national airline to protest the government's austerity
measures. Unions have warned the government to abandon
austerity or face a 48-hour general strike next week.
