   Buena Vista, Colo. -- Unless someone was standing atop
Mounts Whitney, Elbert or Massive at 10:50 a.m., Mountain
Daylight Time, three Thursdays ago, Ray Sokolov and I were
the two highest fellas in the contiguous U.S. of A. At or
about that time, we scrambled to the summit of Mount Harvard,
14,420 feet above sea level.
   That's right. We climbed it. All the way. To the top.

   It was, without question, my greatest moment as a
mountaineer. Ray, who is editor of this page, has loftier
achievements to his credit, such as baking a cake on Mount
Whitney in California, which at 14,495 feet is the tallest in
the 48. But he, too, basked in the glory of the feat.
   As we stood there, perusing the panorama, the interesting
geological fact came to mind that Mount Harvard is just a bit
shorter than nearby Mounts Elbert (14,433 feet) and Massive
(14,421), the only two higher peaks in the Rockies.
   "What if I stood on your shoulders? Would that make us the
highest point in Colorado?" I asked.
   "What if I stood on yours?" he replied.
   After brief consideration, we rejected both propositions.
The footing was a mite shaky, and even if we did it nobody
would believe us.
   But, what the heck, we'd done what we'd come for, and that
was plenty good enough. Standing on my first significant
summit, I knew why people climbed mountains. It's not so much
that they're there, it's that the view from the peak is so
wonderful. Only from the top can you see both sides of
something.
   If you are just tuning in to this column, some background
on this mountaineering business might be in order. Mount
Harvard is the third ascent attempted by the team of Klein
and Sokolov, which I so list for purely alphabetical reasons.
The idea was to convey the joys of mountain hiking -- we're
not talking rope-and-piton climbing here -- to a broad
public. We are middle-aged men in OK, but not sensational,
physical shape. We figured that if we could do it, so could
almost anyone.
   Our first outing, in 1985, was up the above-mentioned
Mount Massive, just north of here in Central Colorado's
Sawatch Range. We climbed well but not wisely, winding up in
a kind of rocky cul de sac 150 feet from the top with
daylight waning. Not being totally crazy, we called it a day.
Ray's new boots produced painful blisters, and the walk down
introduced me to leg muscles I never knew I had.
   It took four years to get us back on the slopes together,
and the next time we picked an easier target. Last September,
along with two guys from the estimable publication Texas
Monthly, we scaled Mount Guadalupe, at 8,751 feet the highest
peak in the Lone Star State. This time the trail went all the
way to the top, so even we couldn't go astray. It was fun,
and emboldened us to try again.
   We picked Mount Harvard because of its impressive height,
scenic locale and accessibility to non-experts. Also, we both
had attended the institution for which it is named. Ray holds
a degree from there in something suitably arcane, like Greek
and Latin studies. I went to the law school only long enough
to make a list of 368 reasons I didn't want to be a lawyer.
   Along with Mounts Yale, Columbia and Princeton, Mount
Harvard is among the so-called Collegiate Peaks. Mounts
Harvard and Yale, a few miles apart, were named by members of
an 1869 expedition led by the intrepid Josiah Whitney. He was
a graduate of Yale and professor of geology at Harvard. The
fact that he named the taller peak after his employer (Mount
Yale measures 14,196 feet) shows that he knew on what side
his bread was buttered. He might have named it for himself,
but he'd already claimed Mount Whitney.
   Our plan was to make the climb in two days to give our
sea-level-bound lungs time to adjust to the altitude. We
arrived in Denver on Tuesday and drove to little Fairplay, at
10,000 feet, to spend the night. My hotel room was on the
second floor, and carrying my suitcase up the one flight of
stairs had me breathing heavily. If anyone needed
acclimatizing, it was me.
   A night's sleep proved beneficial, though, because the
next morning, after driving to the trailhead, we backpacked
the three miles to our campsite in the Horn Fork Basin
beneath the Continental Divide, at about 11,500 feet, with no
ill effects. Ray supplied the tent, one of those new,
featherweight jobs, and it looked comfortable enough. I'd
last camped out in 1962, during Army basic training, and
swore never to do it again (they made us sleep with our
rifles]), but figured one night couldn't be too bad.
   I was wrong. At about 7 p.m. it began to rain, and there
was nowhere to go but the tent. At 8 it was still raining and
dark, and there was nothing to do but sleep. I awoke at 3
a.m. ready to go, but the day wasn't. The next three hours,
listening to Ray snore in the wet, cold blackness, were among
my longest.
   Thursday dawned blessedly clear, and we were on the trail
before 7 a.m. In short order we tromped through the treeline,
"krummholz" (stunted trees and stuff) and alpine tundra. At
about 13,000 feet, at beautiful Bear Lake, the trail petered
out, but we were not dismayed. Confidently reading the rock
(that's mountaineer talk), we approached the summit from the
southeast, first encountering serious boulders at about
13,500 feet. Ray suggested I think of them as large,
irregular steps, and that helped. They proved easier to
negotiate than some grassy-but-steep stretches.
   The last 100 or so feet were a real scramble. At one point
I found myself holding on to a rock while swinging a leg over
a chasm (well, a 10-foot drop) in search of a foothold. But,
like I said, we made it all the way up, and down too.
   Even Ray, the mountain vet, was impressed with our final
push; he rated it a 4 on a 5-point scale of difficulty. I
later talked to Ron Bentall, a trip leader for the Colorado
Mountain Club who has climbed all 53 of the state's
14,000-plus-foot mountains, and he laughed that it was a 2,
or, maybe, a 3. He agreed, though, that we had a right to
feel proud of our effort.
   We were, and now are looking forward and upward. Anyone
know where we can get a Nepali phrasebook?
