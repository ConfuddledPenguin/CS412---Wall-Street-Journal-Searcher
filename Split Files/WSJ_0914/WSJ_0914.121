   I read with much nostalgia your Aug. 3 page-one article
"Americans' Love of IBM Typewriters Outlasts Company's." My
secretarial career began in 1949, after learning the basic
skills in high school in an excellent commercial-arts
program. The pride and joy of our Office Practice Class was
one of IBM's "ugly black machines with red keys." Through the
years, I have used progressively more sophisticated IBM
typewriters (not swayed by the salesman but by the product),
and I would hope that you can appreciate my feeling that the
computer can never, ever produce a letter that is as
impressive as one typed on the machine that nobody can type
with.
   But error-free, correctly spelled, proportionately spaced
letters do not seem to matter any more in this fast-paced
business world. When I retire in a year and a half, my boss
says I may have this typewriter and you can bet it will be
treated with respect and will receive good care in the hope
that it will last as long as I do.
