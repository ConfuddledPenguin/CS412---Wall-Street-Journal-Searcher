   ZAANDAM, the Netherlands -- Dutch food retailer Ahold N.V.
said it would like to target an acquisition in the U.S. as
part of its continuing expansion plans.
   After strong 1989 net income growth of 33.6% to 194.6
million Dutch guilders ($108.5 million) on sales of 17.6
billion guilders, followed by 39% growth for the first half
of 1990, Ahold has the means to accomplish a large
acquisition.

   To maintain its strategy of balanced growth between the
U.S. and Western Europe after two recent expansion moves in
the U.S., Ahold would prefer to acquire a large European
grocer that occupies one of the top slots in its market.
   Unfortunately, there aren't any suitable candidates on the
market, according to Pierre Everaert, Ahold's president.
   "Why does it have to be a large corporation? Because, if
you talk about Germany, unless you have between {$1.88
billion and $3.14 billion in revenue}, you are just not a
player. . . . The same applies elsewhere. You can be either
first, second or third, but you have to have a certain
critical mass to be able to command the discounts and to
compete in the market," Mr. Everaert said.
   However, opportunities do exist in the U.S., he said. "In
the U.S. we have 356 stores out of 36,000 supermarkets, so
the possibilities are obviously much greater {than in
Europe}."
   With the dollar scraping post-war lows against the
guilder, U.S. businesses appear relatively inexpensive. In
addition, a number of U.S. grocers may be ripe for plucking,
the company asserted.
   "In the last 15 months or the last two years . . . 64
{U.S.} corporations have either done their capital
restructuring, or a leveraged buy-out, or a management
buyout," Mr. Everaert said. With recession in certain areas,
increased costs, and the difficulty of refinancing, "we feel
that several of these companies would either be for sale or
would be looking for a financial partner who would bring in
equity."
   While there may be a wide range of potential targets to
choose from, Mr. Everaert said Ahold would seek to reinforce
its existing position in the U.S., where it operates the
Bi-Lo, Giant Food Stores and First National Supermarket
chains. The three chains mark off a triangular area of the
U.S. roughly bound by Atlanta, Cleveland and Boston.
   In the past, Ahold has expanded its U.S. operations both
by acquiring entire supermarket chains -- as in its 1988
purchase of First National Supermarket -- or through the
purchase of clusters of stores. In 1989, Ahold purchased 21
Kroger stores in North and South Carolina.
   Specifically, Ahold wants to strengthen its grip on the
Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., areas, as well as its
positions in Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y.
   "There are quite a few cities where we are rather strong,
but there are a lot of areas where we aren't No. 1 or No. 2,"
Mr. Everaert said. He said the company would prefer buying
either a cluster of stores or buying a company with $1
billion to $1.5 billion in revenue.
   Analysts gave a favorable reaction to Ahold's acquisition
plans.
   "In the U.S., there are a number of companies that are in
difficulties and, with the dollar so low, they could probably
pick one up that is a pretty good bargain," said Fiona
Marshall, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Group in London.
"The only negative is that a U.S. acquisition increases their
dollar exposure." However, even considering the larger
exposure to the dollar, she said, "I am really quite positive
on Ahold."
   As an alternative, Ahold may target an expansion effort in
Western Europe toward smaller businesses with annual revenue
of between $200 million and $300 million.
   Ahold said it could buy into an existing company, helping
them to develop faster than they would by themselves. Mr.
Everaert said he is looking for partnerships that could later
develop into 100%-owned subsidiaries. He cited Scandinavia or
Spain as possible areas for expansion.
   Toward this end, Ahold is considering deepening its
partnerships with members of the Associated Marketing
Services, an alliance of Western European grocers that
includes Ahold.
   Through the European Retail Alliance, Ahold already has
mutual holdings with the Argyll Group of the U.K. and Groupe
Casino of France -- neither of which are considered possible
targets by Ahold.
   Mr. Everaert ruled out further expansion efforts in
Eastern Europe other than its alliance with the
Czechoslovakian retailer Bramen Ostrava. Although Ahold
signed a letter of intent in June to work with Bramen
Ostrava, the Dutch grocer is already finding their work cut
out for them.
   "They are starting from zero. They are discovering free
enterprise, and there is a tremendous need for coaching, for
training. So we have decided instead of doing a little bit in
many countries we will do one big bit in one country," he
said.
