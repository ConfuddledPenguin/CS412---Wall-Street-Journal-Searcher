   Go-Video Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., said a federal court
decision cleared the way for a trial to begin on its
anti-trust suit against five Japanese makers of videocassette
recorders.
   Go-Video, which is marketing a dual-deck VCR, said a U.S.
district court judge in Phoenix, Ariz., denied a motion by
defendants to delay the trial and refused to reconsider his
denial of a previous motion to dismiss the case.

   The defendants, which Go-Video accuses of conspiring to
block its efforts to market the VCR, are Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., Victor Co. of Japan Ltd., Sony Corp., Sanyo
Electric Co. and NEC Corp.
   The new VCR, which can record two programs at once, plays
one while recording another and duplicate tapes, hit the
market last June.
