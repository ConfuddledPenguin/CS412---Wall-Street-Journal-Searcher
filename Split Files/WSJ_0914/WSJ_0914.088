   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. said the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved its plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection.
   The company had expected to emerge last month, but the NRC
raised questions. Any transfer of ownership, or control, of a
nuclear license is subject to approval by the NRC.
Allegheny's Chemetron unit has a such a nuclear license.

   The maker of Sunbeam and Oster products said it now
expects to emerge from bankruptcy protection the week of
Sept. 24, at which time it will be effectively controlled by
a New York investor group, Japonica Partners.
