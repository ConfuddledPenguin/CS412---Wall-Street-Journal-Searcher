   Tomorrow the skies of Southeast England will once again
reverberate with the sound of warbirds as 168 Royal Air Force
aircraft gather in one of the largest flypasts over London
since World War II. The occasion is the fiftieth anniversary
of the Battle of Britain, when the British will honor the men
and machines of the RAF who fought -- and triumphed -- in one
of history's greatest air battles.
   Although the battle officially commenced on July 10, 1940,
Battle of Britain Day is celebrated on September 15, the day
the RAF downed 56 Luftwaffe aircraft and broke the back of
the German assault. It was a desperate time in the history of
Britain. France had fallen. The British army had evacuated
from Dunkirk. Addressing the House of Commons on June 18,
1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill said:

   "The Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of
Britain is about to begin. . . . The whole fury and might of
the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that
he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If
we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life
of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But
if we fail, then the whole world, including the United
States, . . . will sink into the abyss of a new dark age . .
. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth
last for a thousand years, men will still say, `This was
their finest hour.'"
   Hitler planned to neutralize the Royal Navy by attacking
its vessels in the English Channel, then to eliminate the RAF
and, finally, if necessary, to bomb British cities. Hitler
never imagined that he would have to proceed to the third
stage of the plan, since he was convinced that the Luftwaffe
would gain superiority over the RAF, forcing Britain to
surrender.
   It is questionable whether the RAF could have withstood
the Germans had it not been for Winston Churchill. Ostracized
from politics after his disastrous performance as finance
minister in the 1920s, and labeled a military failure because
of the defeat of the Gallipoli landings he had advocated
during World War I, Churchill had spent the 1930s warning the
British government of German rearmament. With dogged
determination, Churchill persuaded the government to increase
the RAF's budget from $35 million to $150 million between
1934 and 1938.
   On the eve of the Battle of Britain, there were almost
3,000 pilots in RAF Fighter Command. Some 2,353 of these were
British; the remainder were volunteers from other countries,
including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa,
France, Belgium, the U.S., Poland and Czechoslovakia. Many of
the pilots in the battle became legends in their own time.
Among them were Douglas Bader, the legless ace, Peter
Townsend, one-time suitor of Princess Margaret, New Zealander
Al Deere, later an Air Vice-Marshall and South African
"Sailor" Malan, a top scoring ace and brilliant leader.
   A handful of Americans fought in the RAF during the Battle
of Britain and made an impact far out of proportion to their
numbers. Pilot Officers E. Q. "Red" Tobin, D. Mamedoff and V.
C. "Shorty" Keogh, flew Spitfires with 609 Squadron based at
Middle Wallop. After the battle, they transferred to the
first of the Eagle Squadrons, the all-American squadrons of
the RAF. Pilot Officer H.W. Reilley served with 64 and 66
Squadrons flying Spitfires, while Flight Lieutenant C.R.
Davis flew Hurricanes with 601 Squadron based at Tangmere.
Perhaps the most renowned American pilot to serve in the
Battle of Britain was Pilot Officer William "Billy" Fiske of
601 Squadron. His Flight Commander, Sir Archibald Hope,
reputedly said that Fiske was the best pilot he had ever
known, and that he was "terribly nice and extraordinarily
modest."
   Facing the RAF was Air Marshall Hermann Goering's
Luftwaffe, an elite group of superbly trained pilots,
prepared for battle by their experiences in the Spanish Civil
War, and the invasion of Poland and Western Europe.
   The most famous of the Luftwaffe pilots were Adolph
Galland and Werner Molders. The rivalry between these two was
legendary. At the end of the Battle of Britain, Molders was
credited with downing 54 Allied aircraft and Galland with 52,
although both were overshadowed by Helmut Wick, who scored 56
victories before being shot down in November 1940.
   The RAF had suffered heavy losses in the fight for France.
In July 1940, the RAF was left with 331 Spitfires and
Hurricanes, and 150 second line fighters: Blenheims, Defiants
and Gladiators. The second line fighters were cumbersome and
ineffective, and it was left to the Spitfire and Hurricane to
bear the brunt of the battle.
   The Supermarine Spitfire, with its Rolls-Royce Merlin
engine, had a maximum speed of 362 mph. The Hawker Hurricane,
also powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin, could reach a top speed
of 328 mph. While the Spitfire has captured the imagination
of the world with its sleek lines, it was the Hurricane that
would make the most significant contribution in the summer of
1940, claiming 80% of the German losses credited to RAF
Fighter Command.
   The front line fighter of the Luftwaffe was the Bf-109.
Designed by Willy Messerschmitt, and powered by a Daimler
Benz engine, the Bf-109 had a top speed of 357 mph, faster
than the Hurricane but slower than the Spitfire. Regardless
of speed, the Bf-109 was not as maneuverable as the Spitfire
or Hurricane, and this gave the RAF a decisive edge.
   Between early July and mid-August, 1940, the Luftwaffe
launched a series of effective strikes against British
shipping in the Channel, and against coastal targets. The RAF
was desperately short of aircraft, and Britain's aircraft
manufacturers began producing Spitfires and Hurricanes at an
accelerated rate. By Aug. 11, the RAF had shot down 274
German aircraft; it had lost 124 of its own.
   On Aug. 13, Goering launched the "Adlerangriff," or "Eagle
Attack," intended to annihilate the RAF. Between Aug. 13 and
24, some of the most spectacular aerial battles took place,
mainly over Southeast England and the Channel: 283 German
aircraft were downed, and 133 British.
   The battle entered a new phase between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6
when, in addition to attacking airfields and industrial
targets, the Luftwaffe commenced the night bombing of
provincial towns in a last bid to crush British resistance.
During this period, aircraft losses were high on both sides.
Suddenly, on Sept. 7, the Luftwaffe carried out the first of
a series of raids on London in what became known as the
"Blitz." While London was to endure punishing bombardment for
several months, the diversion of the Luftwaffe's energies and
resources to the bombing of London represented a major shift
in strategic objective, and gave the RAF the respite it
needed to regroup. Many regard this as the decision that
enabled the RAF to prevail. On Sept. 17, Hitler's invasion
plans were postponed indefinitely. While attacks on RAF
stations continued through the end of October, and the London
blitz did not end until early 1941, the RAF -- and Britain --
had survived.
   Other factors favored the RAF too. The limited fuel supply
of the Bf-109 gave the German fighter pilots little time to
operate after crossing the Channel, frequently forcing them
to leave the bombers unescorted. The Luftwaffe's bomber
pilots could not communicate by radio with their fighter
escorts, making coordination in the air extremely difficult.
The RAF's radar was also an important advantage. Fighter
Command was able to identify German aircraft as they crossed
the Channel and could "scramble" its fighter squadrons to
intercept enemy raiders with devastating accuracy. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, the RAF pilots were possessed
of an indomitable fighting spirit. They simply refused to
surrender. It was of them that Churchill said, "Never in the
history of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so
few."
