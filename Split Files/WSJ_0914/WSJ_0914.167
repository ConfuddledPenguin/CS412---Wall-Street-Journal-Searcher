   When federal regulators announced the sale of five
insolvent Texas thrifts to New York financier Ronald Perelman
in December 1988, they put the total cost to the government
at about $5 billion. That projection was wildly wrong. The
latest estimate: nearly $10 billion.
   This startling figure comes from a previously unreported
government study that assesses, for the first time, the costs
over the next decade of a flurry of 1988 transactions in
which regulators merged and sold 223 insolvent thrifts. At
the time, M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, proclaimed that these deals "took care" of
the worst thrift problems. He put the cost at $39 billion.

   Wrong again. The new study, a compilation of audits
prepared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., indicates
that the total cost of the so-called Class of '88 will be $90
billion to $95 billion, including tax benefits granted the
buyers and a huge amount of interest on government debt to
help finance this assistance.
   The audits also produced other eye-openers. American
Savings Bank, sold to a group led by Dallas financier Robert
Bass, will cost the government $4.8 billion, compared with an
initial forecast of $1.7 billion. Guaranty Federal, a Dallas
thrift sold to a partnership led by Temple-Inland Inc., a
lumber company, will cost $3.4 billion, up from the $1.5
billion original forecast.
   FDIC documents and a review of the 1988 cases suggest that
Mr. Wall's public accounting of the deals was based on a
series of miscalculations and on financial legerdemain.
First, he was just guessing about the losses at these thrifts
because he had no audits of their financial condition, and he
guessed on the low side. He also excluded $9 billion of tax
benefits given the new buyers; terms of the deals enable the
government to recoup some of those benefits, but most of them
will probably remain with the buyers, increasing the cost to
taxpayers.
   And he used a method of so-called present-value analysis,
which calculated the total costs of the 1988 deals as if they
would be paid at once, even though most of the expense was
financed with 10-year notes. That method, in effect,
eliminated interest due on the notes, a sum totaling about
$14 billion. Also missing is as much as $20 billion in
interest the Treasury will have to pay on borrowings for the
transactions.
   In a small number of transactions, perhaps fewer than 10,
the regulators appear to have thrown together rescues in such
haste that far too much assistance was paid to financiers
such as Mr. Perelman. Members of Congress, and especially
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, have denounced
these sales as giveaways. Today, the House Banking Committee
will hold hearings on the 1988 deals.
   But the 1988 thrift rescues' most expensive flaw doesn't
appear to be the enrichment of tycoons. Rather, it's that
none of the deals ended or even limited the government's
exposure to mismanagement by the new owners, hidden losses on
real estate in the past or the vicissitudes of the
real-estate markets in the future. The future losses keep
growing with each new downturn in real-estate markets and
could deepen much faster in a severe recession. And some of
the deals appear to be sham transactions, in which failing
thrifts were sold to failing thrifts, which are failing all
over again.
   "The deals, and the government policy undperpinning them,
were a disaster for taxpayers, and the Bank Board's {cost
estimates} were a joke," says Gerard Smith, a Salomon Inc.
official who advised the Bank Board on one of the
transactions.
   "I didn't make the calculations," responds Mr. Wall, the
Bank Board's former chairman. "Economists and finance people
did." Moreover, Mr. Wall's defenders say, the FDIC numbers
don't include the value of equity positions that the
government has in some 1988 deals, which could be worth
several billion dollars. Mr. Wall adds that the use of
present-value figures was justified because that is a
standard government budgetary technique.
   Although the thrifts proved to be in far worse shape than
the Bank Board estimated, Mr. Wall defends his strategy for
rescuing them with open-ended assistance. "We didn't have the
money to liquidate," he says, adding that the Bank Board
eventually did include the cost of tax benefits in its
estimates.
   The FDIC audits of the 1988 transactions estimate their
cost, over the next decade, at $66 billion, excluding the tax
benefits to acquirers and interest on Treasury borrowings to
pay for assistance. The Perelman transaction, more completely
than any other, shows how these figures ballooned from Mr.
Wall's $39 billion estimate.
   In the fading days of December 1988, Mr. Perelman's
company acquired the remains of five dead Texas thrifts in
return for an investment of $315 million -- of which $160
million was in cash -- and rechristened the group First
Gibraltar Savings Bank.
   The government issued a 10-year, $862 million note to the
Perelman company to cover what Mr. Wall's team calculated to
be First Gibraltar's negative net worth -- the excess of its
liabilities over its assets. In addition, the government
agreed to make good any losses from liquidating First
Gibraltar's bad assets. That freed Mr. Perelman, who owns 97%
of the parent company's stock, of most of the risks. The
government also agreed to pay the company a generous profit
margin, starting at 2.25%, over its costs of holding these
assets. As in most of the 1988 deals, the assistance package
was to run 10 years.
   However, the calculation of First Gibraltar's losses, as
reflected by its negative net worth, turned out to be a lousy
guess. An audit conducted months later revealed that losses
at the time the deal was closed were more than $1 billion
larger than estimated. The size of the note swelled because
it was supposed to cover the negative net worth, and as that
increased, the note was increased. Mr. Wall also didn't
include the cost to the government of $1.2 billion in tax
benefits -- tax-loss carry-forward deductions and tax-free
financial aid -- given the Perelman group.
   Moreover, the government's actual cash expenses over 10
years weren't fully reflected in Mr. Wall's estimates.
Instead, he discounted the costs by roughly 10% a year over
the projected 10-year period to obtain their "present value."
Such discounting is used by government agencies to exclude
the costs of financing, partly because it would be impossible
to determine which of thousands of programs are financed by
taxes or by Treasury borrowings. But the 1988 deals were
financed by notes, and their interest costs and other
payments to the Perelmen group would have to be paid by
issuing more Treasury debt. The present-value technique
eliminated the interest charges on both the notes and
Treasury debt, understating cash outlays in the transaction
by more than $2 billion, according to one thrift economist.
   The Bank Board should have issued estimates both for cash
outlays and in present-value terms, says Dennis Pittman, an
assistant director of the FDIC's office that operates the
defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
supervised the 1988 deals. He adds that the FDIC scoured the
FSLIC's records, but couldn't find any cash estimates when it
began investigation of the transactions. It eventually came
up with a figure of roughly $60 billion, later revised
upward.
   Mr. Wall says cash estimates were in fact prepared for
each case and given to Congress, adding he "can't imagine"
why Mr. Pittman and his FDIC researchers couldn't find them.
The cash estimates were never totalled up nor publicized
because his Bank Board economists assured him "present value
was the best and most logical and most often-used identifier"
of the costs. "I'm not a financial guy or an accountant," he
says. "I relied on the expertise and advice of my
colleagues."
   Comparing the Perelman company's resulting profits to
those of well-run banks and thrifts raises the suspicion that
the Bank Board gave him too much. The new FDIC figures show
that the Perelman company received $445 million of government
money through the end of 1989, and at current interest-rate
levels will receive $8.9 billion over the next nine years, in
addition to the $1.2 billion of tax benefits.
   With that kind of assistance, First Gibraltar had 1989 net
income of $130 million and a return on assets of 1.3%, higher
than all but one of the best-run big U.S. commercial banks.
Mr. Perelman stands to make a killing on the First Gibraltar
deal: Confidential documents circulated by First Gibraltar
show that its parent company expects to distribute $250
million of dividends between 1990 and 1993 -- more than
recouping its cash investment.
   Mr. Perelman declines to comment, but Gerald Ford, the
Texas banker who runs First Gibraltar, denies that the
transaction was overly generous. He attacks the "veracity" of
the new FDIC cost estimates, saying they rely on
difficult-to-forecast interest rates and other imponderables.
   "Sure, we're making outstanding returns, but I truly
believe we will save the taxpayer money in the end," he says.
