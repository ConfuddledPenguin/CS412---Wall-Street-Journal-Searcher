   LONDON -- When it comes to publicity, British publisher
Robert Maxwell has few peers.
   Monday, Mr. Maxwell's tabloid Daily Mirror told its
readers that Mr. Maxwell might inject #12 million ($22.3
million) into Tottenham Hotspur, a top-ranked but
cash-strapped London soccer team. "#12 MILLION TO MAKE SPURS
KINGS OF EUROPE," the Mirror screamed, in a headline that
took most of the entire page.

   In a story emblazoned "Exclusive," Mirror sportswriter
Harry Harris said: "I can now reveal the sensational secret
moves for Maxwell to become England's mega-millionaire soccer
baron, equivalent to the game's wealthiest patrons in the
world, following in the footsteps of Gianni Agnelli of
Juventus, Silvio Berlusconi of AC Milan and Bernard Tapie of
Marseille." A photograph of a beaming Mr. Maxwell accompanied
the story.
   A day later, after suggestions British soccer authorities
might block the deal because of the Maxwell family's other
soccer interests, the Mirror assured its readers: "SPURS DEAL
IS ON]" Under another "Exclusive" label, Mr. Harris quoted
Mr. Maxwell's son, Kevin, as saying the family would sell
some of its stakes in two midranking U.K. teams if it decided
to proceed with the Spurs deal.
   Mr. Maxwell has never been coy about using his media
empire to toot his own horn. Two years ago, the Daily Mirror
serialized an authorized biography of its proprietor. The
book, titled simply "Maxwell," was written by the Mirror's
political editor and published by yet-another arm of Mr.
Maxwell's conglomerate.
   Mr. Maxwell wasn't available. But the Mirror's editor, Roy
Greenslade, cheerfully acknowledged that the proprietor "can,
to an extent, use us as a mouthpiece." But he insisted the
Mirror is merely "using our unique access. You can't avoid
the fact that he's upstairs."
   And in fact, the Mirror didn't break the story. In a juicy
journalistic irony, the Mirror was scooped on its
proprietor's own story: News of the possible investment first
appeared in last weekend's Sunday Times, owned by Mr.
Maxwell's arch-rival, Rupert Murdoch.
   But the Mirror pulled out all the stops to catch up.
Yesterday's update headline, "#12 Million Deal with Maxwell
Continues," was spread across two pages between photographs
of the previous full-page splashes. Mr. Maxwell's face smiled
from yet-another photograph.
   One angle the Mirror hasn't covered: the eyebrows raised
in London financial circles over the way talks between Mr.
Maxwell and Spurs were disclosed. The team, incorporated as
Tottenham Hotspur PLC, is listed on London's Stock Exchange.
Stock-exchange rules require companies to announce
price-sensitive information through the exchange.
   But Spurs didn't disclose the talks with Mr. Maxwell until
Wednesday. On Monday, after the Mirror's first banner
headline, Spurs's shares shot up 14% to 111 pence ($2.06).
   To complicate matters, Spurs also announced Wednesday that
Mr. Maxwell already is involved in a #1.1 million loan to the
team -- a loan some Spurs directors hadn't known about. Spurs
now is embroiled in a boardroom fight over the company's
future; a secretary at the team's office said nobody was
available.
   Amid all this theatrics, Mr. Maxwell's soccer dream may be
evaporating. Four days after the Mirror's first big banner
headline, he issued a statement declaring that he would stop
talks with Spurs unless its "unseemly board squabbles are
resolved speedily and cordially."
   Did the Mirror have any further insight into the
proprietor's about-face? Keith Fisher, the Mirror's sports
editor, said he didn't have time to discuss the matter. He
was late for a meeting . . . with Mr. Maxwell.
