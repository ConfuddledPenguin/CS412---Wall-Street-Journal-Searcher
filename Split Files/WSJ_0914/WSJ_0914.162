   WASHINGTON -- Iran apparently is planning large grain
purchases from Argentina, raising U.S. concerns that Tehran
may send some grain to Iraq despite an international trade
embargo.
   Argentine officials are negotiating the sale with Iran,
diplomats here said. U.S. officials worry that Iran, which
has said it is considering sending food and medicine to Iraq,
may transfer some of the grain to Baghdad on humanitarian
grounds. Iran and Argentina have said they will respect a
United Nations ban on trade with Iraq.

   Many officials doubt Iran will become a conduit for large
amounts of commerce in or out of Iraq and believe the
Argentine purchase could be strictly for Iran's growing
internal needs.
   At a meeting in Moscow, Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze considered
proposing new U.N. actions to tighten the embargo, including
sanctions against nations that ship goods to Iraq by air.
Washington has accused Libya of sending cargo flights,
possibly containing military supplies and spare parts, to
Baghdad. There also have been reports North Korea may be
sending in goods by air.
   Officials of the U.S. and other nations struggled at the
U.N. to draft rules defining when and how food and medicine
could be sent to Iraq for humanitarian reasons. U.S.
officials consider the effort essential to prevent nations
from using a clause in the U.N. sanctions resolution allowing
humanitarian shipments to begin large-scale shipments.
   One U.S. official said the administration is facing "tough
sledding" in persuading other nations to accept the terms
Washington prefers.
   Meanwhile, Iraq issued what some considered a warning of
terrorism against U.S. targets. Iraq's official news agency
said the Iraqi Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the top
U.S. diplomat in Baghdad warning that "the American
government and President Bush should expect that the crimes
the United States of America is committing against the Arab
nation and the insult it is directing to the Islamic shrines
by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a natural
reaction from the Arab and Islamic masses."
   The note apparently was a response to a message a day
earlier by the U.S. warning that Iraq would be held
responsible for any terrorist attack by those acting on its
behalf. A State Department official said the U.S. warning was
prompted by past Iraqi ties to terrorism rather than any
specific threat.
   Separately, the Japanese embassy in Washington announced
that Tokyo would provide an additional $1 billion in
logistical support for the U.S.-led force in the Persian
Gulf. The Japanese also pledged $2 billion in economic aid to
such frontline nations as Egypt, Turkey and Jordan. With the
new pledges, Japan's contribution to the Gulf effort would
total $4 billion.
   The Associated Press reported that West Germany and other
European nations also were considering additional
contributions.
   The State Department said it is arranging two more
chartered airline flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from
Kuwait and Iraq, one leaving today and the other tomorrow.
The department said that 920 American women, dependents and
others already have left Iraq and Kuwait, while about 1,350
Americans remain in Kuwait and 200 in Iraq.
   It wasn't clear how big Iran's prospective purchase of
Argentine grain might be, but there was speculation in grain
markets that it would be substantial and that some of it
could go to Iraq. The speculation arose in part because Iran
and Iraq agreed this week to resume full diplomatic ties.
During negotiations in Iran, Iraqi officials reportedly
suggested a swap of refined petroleum products, which Iran
needs because its refineries were damaged in the Iran-Iraq
war, for food, which Iraq needs because of the embargo.
   Argentina denied knowledge of any attempt to break the
blockade. "We have every intention to observe the blockade,"
said Guido di Tella, Argentina's ambassador to Washington.
"Any Argentine sales to Iran are between two countries that
have agreed to observe the blockade."
   Iran's needs for grain are considerable. It apparently is
importing more wheat than ever before, about five million
metric tons a year, according to an Agriculture Department
official. The nation had a bad wheat harvest in 1989, but
private analysts think this year's harvest is better.
   Last year, Iran bought 1.5 million metric tons of grain
each from the European Community and Australia, the
Agriculture Department official said. According to recent
reports, Argentina exported 1.4 million metric tons of hard
wheat to Iran in the first seven months of this year,
compared with 390,000 metric tons in the first six months of
1989.
   Some analysts believe Iran may want to allow some seepage
of goods to Iraq, both as a show of its own strategic
importance in the Persian Gulf conflict and to earn more
concessions from Iraq on such issues as border demarcation
and prisoner exchanges in the two nations' peace talks.
   But beyond that, Iran may have little incentive to
strengthen its neighbor. "I remain a huge skeptic about these
stories of embargo-busting by Iran," says Shaul Bakhash, an
Iranian scholar and author at George Mason University. "The
Iranians have absolutely no interest in facilitating the
acquisition of Kuwait by Iraq."
   In the Middle East, Secretary of State Baker is scheduled
to meet today with Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss
the anti-Iraq campaign. Syria currently has 4,000 troops in
Saudi Arabia and the nearby United Arab Emirates. There were
reports that Mr. Assad is prepared to send another 10,000
troops and about 300 tanks to the region.
   Mr. Baker replied to a declaration this week by Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that anyone who
battles U.S. "encroachment" in the Persian Gulf is engaged in
a "holy war."
   Mr. Baker said the Iranian statement is "obviously of deep
concern" and added: "We are not indifferent to threats
against our forces, which are there as part of a
multinational presence that includes Moslem and Arab nations.
The Iranians know that we have been invited in to deter an
Iraqi attack."
   The Iranian stance could be a topic of discussion between
Mr. Baker and President Assad, who has been Iran's main Arab
ally and a foe of Iraq.
