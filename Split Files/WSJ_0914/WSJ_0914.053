   With New York City increasingly identified with despair
and darkness, it is a surprise to find a hopeful visionary
stalking its public ways. Such is Tony Hiss, who, in "The
Experience of Place" (Knopf, 233 pages, $19.95), sees our
town as a place for illuminations and intense moments of
mystical absorption.
   In an idiosyncratic and appealing way, Mr. Hiss, a writer
for the New Yorker, savors some selflessly rapt
contemplations of the manifold ways certain places -- in and
outside of New York City -- can refresh and fortify the human
spirit. He dwells above all on the qualities of light.
Mystics love light. Entering the main concourse of Grand
Central Station, he feels in his pulse a cooperative hum, the
choreography of the city, and sees a "different light:
grayer, clearer, brighter."

   In Times Square, he stands by the statue of George M.
Cohan, songwriter of "energy and bounce and beat," and revels
in the sun: ". . . the sun can seem the closest thing around,
and then everything else, even sun-filled air, begins to seem
slightly farther away -- somewhere on the other side of an
enveloping glow." (Significantly, it is at least as much the
shadow as the hulking Marriott Hotel itself that Mr. Hiss
finds to blight Times Square.) By night, "the great neon
signs have almost surrounded the square with flashing light."
Socialized light might be Mr. Hiss's definition of happiness.
   Perhaps the book's most exalted description is of the
simple act of walking through a tunnel in Prospect Park
(Olmsted &amp; Vaux's greatest New York creation) and emerging
out into "the beautiful, undulating Long Meadow," six times
the size of Central Park's Sheep Meadow. ". . . on almost any
day of the year the whole area is flooded with light," he
writes. "The light seems almost to be converging on the
meadow from all directions -- tumbling onto the grass nearby
and also glowing through the trees beyond the meadow." Being
pulled forward into this meadow causes the walker to feel
welcome, safe, full of wonder, he thinks.
   The bliss that Mr. Hiss derives from these democratic
sites (even the immense and banal World Trade Center does not
fail him in this respect) is never a purely private but
always a communal and a potentially utopian one.
   At such stirring moments Mr. Hiss's sensibility, delicate
but vigorous, solipsistic yet sociable, can remind us of the
feelings Willa Cather evoked in her descriptions of the
Southwest. I am thinking of "The Professor's House," in which
she writes, "Once again I had that glorious feeling that I've
never had anywhere else . . . And the air, my God, what air]
-- Soft, tingling, gold, hot with an edge of chill in it . .
. it was like breathing the sun, breathing the color of the
sky."
   But if Cather wove her perceptions into novels, Mr. Hiss's
are too often embedded in a chipperly curious New Yorkeresque
essay style, urging a familiar ecological humanism. A
scholarly supporting cast pops up with a flavor worthy of a
Preston Sturges cast: Dr. Schwartz of Yale has found that the
smell of spiced apple reduces blood pressure; the Kaplans, a
husband-and-wife team from the University of Michigan, think
we have an inborn preference for winding paths; the worthy
"tree lady of Brooklyn" drops by; a German landscaper
explains a new theory of harmoniously planted golf courses; a
geography professor from the University of Delaware finds
looking at trees helps gall-bladder patients recover.
   This gathering of my-isn't-that-interesting tidbits often
struggles unsuccessfully toward the synoptic coherence of a
discipline. But it is mainly the wan placidity of these
informational sections that disappoints, after the white
light of Mr. Hiss's visionary ecstasies.
   A good foil to the authenticity of Mr. Hiss's attempts to
feel himself generously into the souls of places is the
egotistical phoniness of French pundit Jean Baudrillard's
"Cool Memories" (Verso, 234 pages, $45 hardcover, $15.95
paperback), an impressionistic diary from his California
years in the early '80s. The book reminds us that the French
tradition of aphoristic "pensees," from Montaigne and Pascal
through Barthes, has a lot to answer for. Mr. Baudrillard
manages to wed the lapel-grabbing triviality of Andy Rooney
("Have you noticed that flies and wasps die off less and less
in winter?") to the moral philosophy of Hugh Hefner ("To make
you wish to seduce her, a woman should not show herself too
inclined toward rape . . .").
   The overall image we take from this absurd book is of Mr.
Baudrillard in those crazy party years, being tickled in the
Jacuzzi while scribbling his tedious apercus about Dallas in
the wet margins of his Sartre. "It feels so good," he trills
at one point, "to disappear among the masses]" Go right
ahead, Buster, be my guest.
   By the way, a wonderful appreciation of the way American
writers like Cather -- and Thoreau and Twain and Faulkner --
used landscape can be found in Frederick Turner's "Spirit of
Place" (Sierra Club, 381, $24.95). After showing how his
chosen writers related to their land, Mr. Turner goes himself
to have a look today at these fabled spots, often with
disconcerting results.
