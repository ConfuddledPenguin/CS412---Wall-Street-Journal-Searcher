   AKRON, Ohio -- General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., a unit of
Continental AG of West Germany, said it will increase prices
4% to 6% on General brand replacement tires, effective Oct.
15, citing escalation of petroleum-based raw material and
transportation costs.
   Other tire makers recently have announced similar price
increases.
