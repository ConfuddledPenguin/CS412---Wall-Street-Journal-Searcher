   IRAN EMERGES as the biggest potential embargo buster.
   U.S. officials anticipate Tehran will allow at least some
food and medicine shipments to Iraq. It also could buy Iraqi
oil and tolerate some smuggling across its border. The
question is how much. American military officials are
confident they can stop ships from delivering large
Iraq-bound cargoes to Iranian ports, but even modest Iranian
help for Iraq could encourage other cheaters.

   U.S. officials believe Iran wants Western aid too badly to
defy the embargo flagrantly. However, some analysts think it
may try to bolster Iraq just enough to produce a stalemate.
Worse, some fear Tehran wants the embargo to leak enough that
Washington feels compelled to launch an attack that would
destroy the Iraqi war machine Iran itself couldn't defeat.
   Militarily, Iraq can survive the embargo indefinitely. "I
don't think this embargo will hurt their military machine,"
warns Thomas McNaugher of the Brookings Institution.
                                                                                                       

   QUIET DEVALUATION: The dollar falls as the Treasury looks
the other way.
   The greenback is near a 30-year low, but the
administration emphasizes this will help the trade deficit.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Brady urges the Federal Reserve
to ease interest rates, a move that would push the dollar
lower still. Under pressure from the Fed and Congress, the
Treasury at least has stopped selling dollars to hasten the
currency's drop.
   The lure of higher interest rates abroad, combined with
fears that rising oil prices will hit the American economy
especially hard, lie behind the dollar's fall. Although a
budget agreement could bolster the American currency, the
Paris-based OECD believes depreciation will aggravate
inflation and eventually could help lead the U.S. to raise
interest rates.
                                                                                                       

   CONGRESSIONAL CRUNCH? Lawmakers face a crowded agenda.
   Despite concerns about costs, prospects are good for the
clean-air bill and for a compromise on child-care
legislation. Lawmakers advance the civil-rights bill early to
allow time for a possible veto-override attempt; former Urban
League President Vernon Jordan warns that a veto would be "a
terrible mistake," crippling Bush's relations with blacks.
   Deficit pressures portend big battles over where to cut
defense spending. Lawmakers talk about a 20% cut in the farm
bill, the proposed Mars space mission is in trouble, and
skirmishes loom over foreign aid. Sentiment also grows to
override administration objections to textile trade
protection.
   The schedule is tight, but Senate Leader Mitchell and
House Speaker Foley want to avoid a lame-duck session in
their first Congress as top leaders.
                                                                                                       

   CRIME BUSTER: The House probably will approve tougher
gun-control provisions and softer death-penalty language than
the Senate did in its crime bill. Bush has vowed to veto even
the milder Senate version, but he may find that difficult
since it includes politically popular measures aimed at
cracking down on savings and loan fraud.
                                                                                                       

   TAKING OFF? Proposals to let airports tax airline
passengers get new wings. Senate Aviation Chairman Ford has
blocked the idea, but he might back the "departure taxes" in
return for limits on airport noise restrictions. Airports
hungry for funds to finance expansion might go along; and
airlines, eager to override stringent local noise rules, like
the idea.
                                                                                                       

   BACK BURNER: Despite closer links with moderate Arabs, the
U.S. puts Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts on hold. Israeli
Foreign Minister Levy warns Baker that U.S. pressure on the
issue would bring down the government in Jerusalem. Baker
also is wary of appearing to link the Palestinian and Persian
Gulf issues.
                                                                                                       

   TEAM PLAYER: The White House enlisted former Reagan Chief
of Staff Kenneth Duberstein to help prepare it for Supreme
Court nominee Souter's confirmation hearings. Presidential
aides say Duberstein's low-key approach fits well with the
"Bush style." Predicts one top aide: "He'll clearly be asked
to do things in the future."
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS COUNTER Republican challenges in the South.
   Democrats still are optimistic Lawton Chiles will wrest
the key Florida governorship from Republican Martinez. They
also see a possible upset of the incumbent GOP governor in
Alabama; but hopes to win back the governorship in Texas
fade. All Southern incumbent Democratic senators seem safe,
and, at most, the GOP will score only minimal gains in House
races despite several retiring incumbents.
   Although the GOP hopes to end Democratic control of the
Florida Senate, the party otherwise expects few gains in
state legislative contests in Dixie. Republicans argue they
could score big gains in 1992, when population growth
probably will give them openings through reapportionment.
   But analyst Charles Cook notes: "With Republicans in the
South, every two years it's `maybe next time.'"
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Democrats complain that while NBC declined to
air their response to Bush immediately after his address, the
network lobbies against proposed government fees by arguing
that the airwaves are used for the public interest. . . .
Tommy Downs, imprisoned for fraud involving student loans,
tells senators: "The possibility of one of you gentlemen
being in my position is probably greater than the other way
around."
