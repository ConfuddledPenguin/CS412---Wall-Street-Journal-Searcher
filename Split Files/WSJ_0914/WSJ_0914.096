   ATLANTA -- Keeping a straight face was difficult.
   In early 1987, word filtered through the amateur athletic
world that some people in Atlanta had actually decided to bid
for the 1996 Olympic Games.

   Gee, what a nice idea, said amused sports officials in
cities like Toronto, Athens, Greece, and Melbourne,
Australia, all of which had already invested thousands of
hours and millions of dollars in their own bids for the
Games. It's just unfortunate, they said, that Atlanta was
starting too late with too little -- except a considerable
naivete about the cutthroat business of international
athletics.
   Which is like saying Scarlett was naive about Rhett.
   Starting with nine volunteers and working in near-total
obscurity, naive Atlanta has managed to elbow its way to the
front of the race for the biggest and -- with estimated
revenue of $3.5 billion -- the richest prize in sports. With
the vote in Tokyo just four days away, William Payne,
president of the Atlanta Organizing Committee, says only, "We
have a very legitimate chance of winning." But Richard Pound,
an International Olympic Committee vice president in
Montreal, is less guarded. Atlanta, he says "has one of the
best teams -- if not the best -- in the field."
   There are no guarantees, of course. Looming over all the
entrants is Athens, the strong sentimental favorite. Athens
was the host of the first modern Olympics in 1896, and is all
but demanding that the Games be returned to Greece for the
100th anniversary.
   Emotions, however, don't always win Olympic Games,
according to those familiar with the process. Rather, it is
the perpetual and intimate lobbying of the 88 voting members
of the IOC that counts.
   Enter Atlanta, where self-promotion is a major industry.
Yes, some cities have spent more money on their Olympic bids
(Athens is nearing $30 million while Atlanta will come in
under $7 million), and others have spent more time (Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, has been at this since 1985). But Atlanta, once
it decided to enter the fray, has come on like a battering
ram.
   Back in 1987, for instance, the cities of Minneapolis, San
Francisco and Nashville, Tenn., slapped a few postage stamps
on their bids to be the U.S. standard bearer for 1996 and
mailed them off to the U.S. Olympic Committee in Colorado.
Not Atlanta. Mr. Payne flew to Colorado and delivered the
city's bid over breakfast. Ditto in 1989, when team Atlanta
hand-carried its bid documents (five volumes, bound in black,
weighing 17 pounds and costing about $750,000) to the IOC's
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   Those books are filled with striking drawings of what
Atlanta's organizers envision their Olympics would look like.
But that's one problem with the city's bullish bid: Much of
it is still on the drawing board. Atlanta estimates it would
have to shell out $1 billion to stage the Games -- almost
twice what Los Angeles spent -- primarily because of the need
to build, among other facilities, an 80,000-seat
track-and-field stadium and an Olympic village for the
athletes. Total planned cost of new construction: more than
$400 million.
   Atlanta's boosters dismiss such concerns by pointing to
the revenue side of the ledger. They estimate the city will
have about $1.16 billion to play with -- about $400 million
more than Los Angeles -- primarily because of more lucrative
broadcast rights (a projected $549 million vs. $286 million
in 1984) and bigger sponsorship fees ($324 million vs. $126
million). Confidently, the organizers see a surplus at the
end of the Games of about $156 million.
   Less confidently, Donald Ratajczak, director of the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, says
Atlanta "may be able to break even." "Their sponsorship
estimates are high. Companies aren't doling out that kind of
money anymore for sports." But that could be offset, he says,
by higher TV revenue.
   While Atlanta may have been a bit short on facilities, it
"did a tremendous job of getting {IOC} members to visit,"
says Mr. Pound in Montreal. In all, 70 of the IOC's 88
members made the trek to Georgia, and, once there, were
dipped, rolled and fried in Southern hospitality.
   In the summer of 1989, for instance, the president of the
International Canoe Federation had asked to visit the Ocoee
River in northern Georgia, where the canoeing events would be
held. Before arriving, however, Atlanta officials discovered
the river was dry, the result of a closed dam upstream in
Tennessee. The solution: Call Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
and ask him to ask the Tennessee Valley Authority to open the
gates. "Voila, white water]" says Robert Brennan, a spokesman
for the Atlanta Organizing Committee.
   Moving through all these encounters -- lobbying officials
from Libya or canvassing visitors from Cameroon -- has been
Atlanta's trump card: Andrew Young. The former ambassador to
the United Nations and former mayor of Atlanta was an early
supporter of the city's bid and brought an instant cachet to
its efforts.
   Evoking the name of Martin Luther King Jr., whom he served
as a principal aide, and recalling the spirit of the
civil-rights movement, Mr. Young was able to gain the
confidence and support of Olympic officials, particularly
those from the Third World, who otherwise may have dismissed
a bid from the U.S.
   All these efforts, of course, are designed to maximize
Atlanta's appeal and minimize the baggage it carries. One
obvious problem is the fact that the U.S. had the Summer
Games, in Los Angeles, just six years ago. Another is that
the U.S. government has been a less-than-sterling supporter
of the Olympics. (Remember Jimmy Carter's 1980 boycott of
Moscow?)
   Atlanta's organizers have tried to turn the Los Angeles
problem into an advantage, arguing first of all that seven of
the past 15 Summer Games have been held in Europe in an area
smaller than the distance from Los Angeles to Atlanta. And,
they ask, what country was host of the most successful (read:
profitable) Olympics ever? Why, the U.S., of course. (The
city has already promised to split any surplus from the Games
with the IOC.)
   So what remains in Atlanta's path? Five hurdles: Belgrade;
Manchester, England; Toronto, Melbourne and Athens. The first
two are dismissed as serious contenders by most observers:
Both lack many of the basic amenities, like major airports
and extensive hotel space, that the IOC looks for. Toronto is
a city divided; several civic groups have noisily questioned
the wisdom of spending $1 billion on a track meet. Melbourne
bills itself as the city free from strife, but can't quite
get around the problem that it is far from anywhere. And
Athens -- well, Athens is one of the dirtiest and
least-efficient capitals in the world.
   Which the IOC might ignore altogether.
   "Right now, I'd put Atlanta dead even with Athens," says
John Bevilaqua, a vice president at the Los Angeles Games who
now heads a sports marketing firm in Atlanta. A strong -- and
sentimental -- European bloc in the IOC, some of whom Mr.
Bevilaqua refers to as the Old Guard, "may want to take the
Games back to Athens," he says. "But the `New Guard' is
looking for a city to take us into the next 100 years."
