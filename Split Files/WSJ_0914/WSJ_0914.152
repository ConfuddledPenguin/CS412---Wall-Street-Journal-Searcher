   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled in a sell-off linked to
nervousness about today's flurry of economic reports and
frustration with the drawn-out negotiations on a federal
deficit reduction package.
   Reports that Iraq had issued a warning to U.S. officials
about possible terrorist attacks against American targets
unsettled the market as well, traders said.

   "You've got an event-driven market where everyone's really
concerned about the next move overseas," compounding fears
about the domestic situation, said Larry Greenwald, a block
trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 43.07 to 2582.67
-- its sharpest decline since Aug. 23 -- as stocks buckled
under the weight of broad-based selling. Decliners topped
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,009 to 430.
   Broader indexes weren't hit quite as hard as the
industrial average, but nonetheless dropped sharply. Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, went down 3.89 to
318.65; its 1.21% drop compared with a 1.64% decline in the
Dow Jones industrials. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 1.93 to 175.16 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 3.41 to 295.39.
   Meanwhile, the lackluster pace of trading over the past
two weeks remained intact despite the market's retreat.
"There's just very, very little to do, and it's obviously
frustrating," said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at
Nikko Securities International.
   Big Board volume amounted to 123,370,000 shares, down from
Wednesday's total of 129,890,000 shares.
   A flurry of sell programs resulting from stock-index
arbitrage hit the market during the afternoon, contributing
to its downturn, traders said. The programs took effect as
stock-index futures went down faster that the cash indexes,
creating opportunities to profit by purchasing futures
contracts and selling baskets of stocks.
   Four major economic reports are scheduled for release
before trading opens today, with the August producer price
index drawing most of the market's interest. The PPI
represents the first piece of inflation data affected by the
surge in oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The index is expected to be up 1.4% for the month,
according to a consensus forecast of economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. But analysts believe the
market may pay closer attention to an index of prices
excluding food and energy, expected to rise 0.3% for August,
because a surge in the overall index is being anticipated.
   Rao Chalasani, a technical analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp;
Turben in Cleveland, said the market's fall may already have
discounted the possibility of a disappointment in the report.
"It just has to continue," he said of the market's
low-volume, sideways movement.
   August reports on retail sales, industrial production and
capacity utilization are also on the schedule for this
morning.
   As for the deficit-reduction talks, traders said the
inability of negotiators to complete a budget package has
begun taking a toll on the market. "Most people were
enthusiastic that they would have that {agreement} settled by
the end of this week. That doesn't seem to be the case any
more," said Mr. Walsh of Nikko Securities.
   Money-center bank issues were hit with selling as the
market absorbed congressional testimony from Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the banking system is
facing "all too many problems" as the quality of loan
portfolios at many banks continues to deteriorate.
   Chase Manhattan, which fell 1/2 Wednesday in the wake of a
poorly received sale of $200 million in notes, lost another
3/8 to 16 3/4. Among other money-center issues, Citicorp fell
1/4 to 17 3/8, J.P. Morgan eased 1/2 to 32 1/8, BankAmerica
lost 5/8 to 21 3/4 and Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 1 1/4 to
25 5/8.
   Digital Equipment dropped 2 3/8 to 59 1/4 in composite
trading of 1.3 million shares, extending a sell-off
attributed to disappointment with presentations at two
investment conferences earlier in the week and subsequent
reductions in several analysts' earnings forecasts. Over the
past three sessions, the stock has lost a total of 5 5/8
points, or 8.7%.
   John B. Jones, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, said
Digital's presentation at a conference hosted by his firm
"didn't leave a lot of hope for a quick turnaround,"
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   Meanwhile, Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its projection of
Digital's fiscal 1991 earnings by $1.05 a share, to $5.15 a
share.
   International Business Machines, a strong performer in
recent sessions, skidded 2 7/8 to 105 on 1.1 million shares.
Other blue chips that fell sharply included United
Technologies, which tumbled 1 3/4 to 47 7/8; Coca-Cola, which
dipped 7/8 to 41 1/4; and Eastman Kodak, which lost 1 1/8 to
40 3/8.
   Hilton Hotels, which forecast that its third-quarter net
income from operations would be about 50% lower than a year
earlier, fell 2 1/4 to 29 1/4.
   Motorola rose 1/2 to 61 3/8. The Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday that the company has reached an agreement
in principle with Toshiba to establish a semiconductor joint
venture in Scotland, expanding a three-year relationship
between the two concerns.
   Canadian Pacific gained 1/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.6 million
shares. The company said it plans to repurchase nearly 31.5
million of its common shares, or 9.9% of the shares
outstanding, in a one-year buy-back program starting next
week.
   Corroon &amp; Black, which jumped 6 3/4 in composite trading
Wednesday after Aon offered $40 a share for the company,
retreated 1 3/8 to 36 1/4 on 1.2 million shares. Britain's
Willis Faber, which previously agreed to a stock-swap merger
of the company, said it is still committed to that offer. Aon
fell 1 1/8 to 31 7/8.
   MGM/UA Communications, profiled in the Journal's "Heard on
the Street" column, fell 5/8 to 14 5/8. Traders and analysts
believe the stock could retreat below 10, and perhaps into a
range of 7 to 8, if Pathe  Communications doesn't complete
its takeover of the company.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.18
to 322.01. Volume totaled 9,720,000 shares.
