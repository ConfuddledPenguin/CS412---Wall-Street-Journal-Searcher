   So far, the Persian Gulf crisis has overshadowed almost
every other issue on the campaign trail. That may change next
week. Oklahoma could become the first state in the nation to
limit the number of terms its state legislators can serve. If
you want to hear a blowout louder than anything likely to
occur in the Gulf, ask an incumbent politician what he or she
thinks of term limitation. Term limitation may yet become the
campaign's sleeper issue.
   The Oklahoma initiative would limit any legislator to a
total of 12 years in either house. More than 200,000 voters
signed petitions to place it on the ballot, and it has
attracted bipartisan support. If Oklahoma approves term
limitation it will provide a big boost to parallel efforts in
Colorado and California. The Colorado initiative is
significant in that it also seeks to limit the terms of
office the state's Members of Congress can serve.

   The initiative's sponsor, State Senator Terry Considine,
points out that the Constitution gives the states the power
to regulate the "time, manner and place" of elections to
Congress. In the past, states have been given broad authority
to establish their own election procedures. About half of the
states elected Senators by a form of popular vote before the
constitutional amendment for direct election of Senators
passed, and Texas allowed both Lyndon Johnson and Lloyd
Bentsen to run for vice president and re-election to the
Senate at the same time.
   Term limitation is an issue that is instinctively popular
with voters. National surveys show it is favored by two to
one in all sections of the country and by all income groups.
Blacks favor it even more than whites, women more than men.
Last week, the California Poll found the more restrictive of
the two term-limitation measures on the ballot was favored by
72% of voters with only 14% opposed. A surprising 46% said
they strongly supported the idea.
   None of this fazes one of the nation's great proponents of
keeping politicians sitting pretty: Democratic Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, the operator of an awesome political
machine in California. Earlier this year, Speaker Brown
defeated redistricting reform initiatives with commercials
that linked them with corporate greed, the Exxon Valdez spill
and dead otters. Ironically, Mr. Brown's allies strong-armed
corporations into financing that $7 million campaign with
subtle threats that those that didn't contribute would see
their interests under attack in the legislature.
   Naturally, Mr. Brown views term limitation as a threat to
his empire. Speaker Brown plans to finance his projected $4
million campaign against term limitation with the same
squeeze plays that have worked for him in the past. Dan
Walters, a columnist for the Sacramento Bee, reports Mr.
Brown has been "hammering" corporations to buy $1,000 tickets
to a Beverly Hills anti-term-limitation fund-raiser, which
was to be held last night. Organizers report the final take
from the event should be $1.6 million.
   The great fear, of course, is that if term limitation
passes in a state as politically important as California, it
could create the kind of nationwide political tidal wave that
sent Proposition 13's tax-cutting movement rolling across the
country in 1978. Just as the anti-tax movement came to rest
in Washington, the term-limitation movement may some day wash
through the halls and offices of Congress.
