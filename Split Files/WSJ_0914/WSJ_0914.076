   Small companies often can make money by licensing their
concepts to foreign companies. Indeed, licensing may take off
overseas even before the products or processes involved have
established themselves in the U.S.
   So says Eugene M. Lang, president of REFAC Technology
Development Corp., a New York company that helps other
companies license their industrial technology. REFAC, founded
in 1952 by Mr. Lang, has negotiated hundreds of U.S. and
foreign manufacturing licenses. It is currently involved with
such diverse industrial technologies as liquid-crystal
displays, bar-code scanning and robotics.

   The 72-year-old Mr. Lang says he has been an entrepreneur
since age eight, when he peddled to other boys lead-weighted
pieces for a game called street checkers. "It was a very
profitable business," he says. "It kept me in hot dogs and
anything else I needed."
   In an interview, Mr. Lang provided some insights on how
business owners can profit from licensing:
                                                                                                       

   Q. Why do so many small companies go into licensing,
rather than start their own operations overseas?
   A. Many small companies can't afford to invest capital in
foreign facilities, and they don't have personnel to send
over there. Often, small-company owners don't even have the
time to acquaint themselves with foreign markets. The
alternative is to license -- to find someone who can capture
the market for you who is already at home in that market.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How much income can a license produce, and how
significant might that be for a small company?
   A. We have royalty rates as low as one-eighth of 1% of
sales and as high as 15%. As a result, it's been my
experience that I've seen as much as one-third of total
profits for a small business being derived from overseas
licenses. And besides profit, there's invaluable feedback --
in research and development, marketing experience and
engineering -- that you get from foreign licensees. You have
an opportunity to exploit all that in the biggest and best
market of all, namely the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Q. For example?
   A. With Heli-Coil {a fastener technology now owned by
Black &amp; Decker Corp.}, we had to develop an economic and
technical rationale for the products. We had to spend a lot
of money finding applications and testing them out, and the
experience we obtained through foreign licensees was of
tremendous value. We brought back to America all the
technical standards and proven applications. We later did the
same thing with a new type of rolling diaphragm {another
industrial part}.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Is there still untapped potential for small companies
to benefit from licensing?
   A. When I started out 40 years ago, just the word
"licensing" was something that applied more to a dog than to
a business. Now universities are involved in licensing, and
most big corporations are involved in licensing. There are
licensing textbooks. But the average small company hasn't
given much thought to licensing -- I would say there are
thousands that aren't even aware of it. And many think of
licensing only in terms of products, whereas licensing can
also be very important in terms of processes. Maybe I'm only
talking about bread -- a new process for mixing dough or for
packaging bread more effectively. A lot of business people
don't realize their processes can be licensed. Others are
intimidated; they're afraid they'll wind up giving their
secrets away for nothing.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Typically, when an opening does seem to exist, how long
does it take for a newcomer to licensing to start earning
royalties?
   A. You have to be prepared for it to be a slow process.
Normally you don't take a product and assume that anything is
going to happen in as little as one or two years. You have to
examine the market and figure how best to exploit it. For
example, if you have a patented process, how do you even
figure the basis for charging a royalty? Having a product or
process that's merely better or different is not enoughthere
has to be enough economic value in it that you can get your
share and keep the other guy profitable, too.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Meanwhile, how much does an inventor or small company
have to give up in exchange for marketing help overseas?
   A. At REFAC we normally work on a 50-50 basis; we share in
the gross proceeds of the venture. But for the inventor, 50%
of something is a lot better than 100% of nothing. If we
don't accomplish any good result, that's our loss.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Which parts of the world are best for seeking licensing
deals?
   A. The U.S., Japan and Western Europe, especially England,
France, Germany. Going elsewhere is often a waste of time --
you can accomplish deals but not make much money out of them.
For example, in India I was able to get the government to
approve joint ventures -- but then there were problems
getting dividends, getting raw materials, problems getting
import permits.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Why do you urge small companies to develop and license
trademarks as well as products?
   A. Patents dwindle in value as they age and as technology
advances. But trademarks become more valuable the longer
they're used. With Heli-Coil, the patent expired, but there
are still foreign royalties in the seven figures. That's
because of the trademark plus the ongoing exchange of knowhow
related to manufacturing improvements.
                                                                                                       

   Q. What's the first thing a newcomer to licensing needs to
think about?
   A. The first thing you have to do is define very
realistically what it is you have to offer. There are
enormous opportunities if manufacturers become introspective
and try to evaluate the novelty of their own manufacturing
experiences: What is it that makes them competitive, what is
it that makes their product better? You often make more money
from licensing your know-how for production or product
control than you could from actually selling your finished
product in a highly competitive market.
