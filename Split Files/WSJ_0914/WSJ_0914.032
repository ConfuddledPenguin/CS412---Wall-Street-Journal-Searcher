   STOCKHOLM -- Bilspedition AB agreed to acquire a 50% stake
in Sweden's domestic airline Linjeflyg AB, the clearest sign
yet that the Swedish government is serious about airline
deregulation and trimming state ownership in Scandinavian
Airlines System.
   Bilspedition, Scandinavia's biggest freight forwarder, is
purchasing SAS's 50% holding in Linjeflyg for 475 million
Swedish kronor ($82 million). The remaining half of Linjeflyg
is controlled by AB Aerotransport, one of three
half-state-owned holding companies that own SAS under a
labyrinthine structure.

   But Swedish government officials also held open the door
to further reduction of the state's stake in connection with
a possible stock market introduction of Linjeflyg in two to
three years.
   Reducing the state to a minority owner in Linjeflyg is an
important psychological step toward privatization of SAS,
industry analysts said. Last month, Sweden's center-left
government hinted it might also consider trimming its stake
in Aerotransport to a minority 40% if co-owners Denmark and
Norway followed suit.
   That move would be intended to facilitate SAS's planned
share exchange with Swissair under a strategic alliance
forged last year. But it sparked political grumbling,
especially among some Social Democratic Party representatives
in the Swedish parliament who remain skeptical of
privatization, or sale of state companies to private
investors.
   SAS said the sale of its Linjeflyg holding was prompted by
planned deregulation of domestic air traffic in Sweden. "Now
seems the right time to terminate our ownership interests.
SAS and Linjeflyg will gradually become competitors -- and
with the sale we avoid potential conflicts of interest,
especially when new route awards are at stake," said Jan
Carlzon, SAS chief executive officer.
   SAS currently holds a monopoly on certain domestic routes
-- such as between the capital of Stockholm and Gothenburg
and Malmoe, Sweden's second and third biggest cities. Those
routes boast almost twice the annual passenger volume of
traffic from Stockholm to northern cities such as Umea and
Sundsvall, where Linjeflyg has exclusive traffic rights. "SAS
knows we will start on Malmoe and Gothenberg as soon as
deregulation takes effect -- probably Jan. 1, 1992," said
Linjeflyg President Christer Nilsson.
   To that end, Linjeflyg has begun an aggressive
fleet-renewal program, replacing aging Fokker F28 planes with
bigger Boeing 737-500 jets. By using bigger planes, Mr.
Nilsson hopes to reduce the number of Linjeflyg's flights and
thus hold ballooning operating costs in check.
   Linjeflyg has taken delivery of three 737s to date, holds
firm orders for eight and options for 12 more planes. The
firm orders represent an investment of $300 million -- and,
if exercised, the options an additional $336 million.
   Mr. Nilsson said the airline needs to post annual
operating profit of roughly 200 million kronor to pay for the
new planes. Last year, Linjeflyg's pretax profit excluding
one-time gains from aircraft sales was about 90 million
kronor; in this year's first six months, weakened by an air
controllers' strike, operating profit skidded to 28 million
kronor.
   Bilspedition officials have some ideas about how to
bolster that anemic profit. One could be a national express
delivery service for packages and documents, tapping into
Bilspedition's computer systems and international links as
agent for United Parcel Service of America Inc., Greenwich,
Conn.
   Eventually, airline industry deregulation in Europe could
open possibilities to expand such a service -- as well as air
freight operations -- outside Scandinavia, a Bilspedition
spokesman said. The company will consider other ways to plug
Linjeflyg's biggest operating problem -- "a lot of
underutilized capacity," the spokesman added. "Linjeflyg is a
company that has a few problems ahead, but we thought the
price was fairly good."
   A domestic airline is just the latest twist in an
aggressive buying spree that nearly doubled Bilspedition's
sales during the past three years. The biggest step in that
expansion push was the purchase of shipping group
Transatlantic AB two years ago.
