   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Savin Corp. said it received contracts
valued at between $5 million and $10 million annually to
supply photocopy machines to the Navy.
   Under the contracts, renewable for as long as five years,
the distributor of office copiers and facsimile machines will
supply photocopiers to Navy offices around the country. The
contracts are on a cost-per-copy basis, which means Savin's
revenue depends on how many copies Navy officials make.
