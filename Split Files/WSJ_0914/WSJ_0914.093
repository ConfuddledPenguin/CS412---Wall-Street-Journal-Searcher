   ATLANTA -- A group of more than 20 lenders to
architect-developer John Portman said they made "positive
progress" toward restructuring some or all of his roughly $2
billion of debt.
   Mr. Portman is facing a cash crunch and has stopped
servicing tens of millions of dollars of unsecured loans, as
well as the $332.6 million mortgage on his Peachtree Center
office buildings here. That mortgage is held by Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Nippon Life Insurance
Co. of Japan.

statement that it plans to meet again soon.
