   WASHINGTON -- A Senate Appropriations subcommittee dealt a
major blow to the administration's space program by wiping
out virtually all new funding for the Moon and Mars
initiative and cutting $863.6 million from the space
station's fiscal 1991 budget.
   Total funding for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would grow to $13.45 billion in the year
beginning Oct. 1, but the cut from the proposed space station
represents a 35% reduction from the president's request and
would end much of the project as now envisioned.

   The administration is certain to fight to restore funds,
but the reductions highlight the vulnerability of the entire
NASA program given the pressure for domestic spending cuts.
"I can figure out a lot of ways for the space station to
survive," said one committee analyst, "but I don't know how
you sustain NASA" in later years.
   The Moon-Mars initiative is most vulnerable given the cuts
voted earlier by the House, and the Senate action reflects
the choices facing lawmakers as allocations for domestic
programs are reduced further. Much of the administration's
request for the space shuttle is protected, but the
CRAF-Cassini project, an ambitious follow-on to the
celebrated Voyager mission, would lose one of its two
spacecraft, and NASA's request for the high-speed national
aerospace plane would be cut nearly 37%.
   NASA's costly Earth Observing System satellite program is
preserved near the administration's request, but the
subcommittee cut the hardware for the larger EOS platforms by
one-third to $88 million. Part of the savings would be
redistributed to more than double the proposed budget for the
smaller Earth probe satellites to $56 million, with the
largest increase to a project focusing on tropical rain
forests and climatic and atmospheric changes.
   The bill reverses a House decision to kill an ongoing
project for studying extraterrestrial life, but would block a
$10 million House initiative to fund a synthetic-aperture
radar program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The pressure on the space program is increased by the fact
that it competes directly with housing, environmental, and
veterans accounts within the same subcommittee. The total
bill allocates nearly $78.6 billion in new spending authority
within fiscal 1991. But given the vagaries of the budget
process, NASA finds itself most directly in competition with
the rising costs of veterans medical care.
   For veterans care, the subcommittee approved the full
administration request of more than $12.2 billion. Elsewhere,
National Science Foundation appropriations would rise 14% to
$2.36 billion, or only slightly below the president's
request. An estimated $6.02 billion is provided for the
Environmental Protection Agency and related programs,
including a 23% increase in pollution abatement and control
programs from current funding.
   The most serious policy differences are likely to involve
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where the
subcommittee added more than $3 billion from current funding
for federally subsidized housing. Though relatively
slow-spending, the commitment represents a 38% increase above
fiscal 1990 and assumes funding for 125,000 new units of
housing, or about 40,000 more than this year's level.
   Within the same account, lawmakers allocated $50 million
for "special purpose grants," and while giving HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp sufficient funding for two of his initiatives,
influential members used their position to earmark the
remainder for more than 20 projects of their own.
