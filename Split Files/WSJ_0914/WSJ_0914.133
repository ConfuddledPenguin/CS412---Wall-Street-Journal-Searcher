   Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp.,
said it will lay off 350 white-collar employees Saturday in
order to make the company more competitive.
   The helicopter manufacturer said the layoffs, concentrated
in the Connecticut area, include engineers and administrative
personnel. "We decided to size the company to be leaner and
more competitive, after looking at different segments of the
business," a spokesman said. The cuts reduce Sikorsky's work
force to 11,300.

   Last February, the company, based in Stratford, Conn.,
laid off 300 white-collar workers as a reaction to cuts in
defense spending. Fifty hourly workers were laid off in
March, and another 50 were cut through attrition that month.
   In the second quarter, United Technologies earnings
increased 51% to $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share.
   Sikorsky Aircraft has operations in Bridgeport, West
Haven, Shelton and Trumbull, Conn., as well as Troy, Ala.,
and West Palm Beach, Fla. Its major military products include
the Black Hawk and Super Stallion helicopters.
