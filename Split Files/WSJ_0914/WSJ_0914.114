   Hilton Hotels Corp. said it sees a 50% drop in
third-quarter operating profit, largely reflecting
competition from two splashy casino-resorts that opened in
Las Vegas, Nev., during the past year.
   The forecast reflects the first two and a half months of
the quarter, which ends Sept. 30. In the year-ago quarter,
Hilton's operating profit was $30.5 million, or 63 cents a
share. Net income, after a small loss on property
transactions, was $28.1 million, or 58 cents a share.

   "Our results {this quarter} have been below Wall Street
expectations and below our expectations," Steve Krithis, vice
president and controller said in an interview from Hilton
headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif. "The new kids on the
block . . . are having an adverse impact."
   Hilton's stock price fell $2.25 to $29.25 on turnover of
more than one million shares in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. The shares had risen as high as
$33.125 before trading was halted pending release of the
profit forecast.
   Hilton blamed the decline largely on a reduction in
gambling revenue at the Las Vegas Hilton. Competition for big
spenders and table players has been keen from Golden Nugget
Inc.'s Mirage, which opened in November, and Circus Circus
Enterprises Inc.'s Excalibur, which opened earlier this year.
   The Excalibur has taken foot traffic from the Las Vegas
Hilton and from Hilton's Flamingo; the Mirage has greatly
increased competition for high-rollers, said Michael Mueller,
an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. "It's doubtful
Hilton will be able to win back as many people as they lost"
because the rivals' themed entertainment is "where the action
is," the analyst said.
   The Las Vegas Hilton, a 3,174-room hotel and casino, is
one of Hilton's most important gambling properties that, as a
group, generally accounts for 50% of the company's operating
net. Hilton said hotel profit was down slightly because of a
soft summer in New York City, a major market.
   Mr. Krithis said that hotels in other major markets,
including Hawaii, Chicago and San Francisco, "are doing
well," although San Francisco is still feeling the blow from
the October 1988 earthquake. Hilton said it is has begun
posting profits from its new Flamingo hotel in Laughlin,
Nev., which opened Aug. 1.
   At an investment conference in Las Vegas yesterday, John
J. Giovenco, Hilton's head of gambling operations, elaborated
on his reasons for selling his entire stake in Hilton's
shares late last month. He said he sold to raise funds to
cover a margin call on another stock. The Hilton stock was
his other major asset, he said.
   Mr. Giovenco's 20,000 shares fetched an average of $35.50,
or about $710,000; he paid about $948,000 to buy the stock in
late 1988. Hilton stock has fallen since its report in July
of a 21% drop in second-quarter operating profit from
casinos. The stock hit a high of $115.50 last year when
Hilton was actively seeking merger partners.
