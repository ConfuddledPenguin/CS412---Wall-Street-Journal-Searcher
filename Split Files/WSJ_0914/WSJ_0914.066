   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks accelerated their
decline as the market pondered a recessionary economy without
a federal budget agreement in sight.
   While equity market indexes dropped ahead of today's
producer price, retail sales and industrial production data,
the markets absorbed more bad news in the form of Iraqi
threats of terrorist actions against U.S. targets.

   The skittish stock markets have been predisposed to
decline at every hint of bad news since Iraq invaded Kuwait
six weeks ago. No budget agreement yesterday was just what
stock prices didn't need.
   "Stock prices were eroding as it was. When there was talk
of no budget, it just pulled the floor out," says Philip
Benizzi, head of OTC trading for Dillon Read &amp; Co.
   The fact that volume remains near its lowest levels of the
year only seemed to exaggerate the decline.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.14 points, or 1.09%, to
376.18. Volume edged up to 105.7 million shares from
Wednesday's 98.5 million shares. There were 1,105 declining
issues while 672 advanced.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the situation was much the
same. The Big Board's composite index also fell 1.09%,
closing at 175.16, down 1.93. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average lost 43.07, or 1.64%, to close at 2,582.67
   "It doesn't mean anything," Interstate-Johnson Lane's
Senior Vice President for OTC trading Nelson Gold says of
yesterday's tumbling market.
   Mr. Gold says the market is merely drifting amid
cross-currents from budget negotiators, the Middle East, the
Federal Reserve and the economy. Until the Persian Gulf
situation is resolved, a budget is in place and the Fed eases
credit, Mr. Gold says, the market will meander.
   "People are just doing the minimum they have to do," he
says.
   The absence of investor conviction probably is hurting
small stocks worst, says Jonathan Raclin, executive vice
president in charge of sales, trading and research for
Chicago Corp.
   Investors "are saying `we like small stocks,'" Mr. Raclin
says. "But they're saying `call me when they're cheaper.'"
   Investors interpreted bad news out of Japan as a sell
signal for the most active OTC issue, Conner Peripherals.
   Toshiba announced it had developed a 2.5-inch micro hard
disk drive that could compete with Conner Peripherals
products. Trading 4.1 million shares, Conner Peripherals fell
1 5/8 to 20 5/8. Some analysts say the sell-off was an
overreaction.
   Also on the active list, Tele-Communications Class A
shares were unchanged at 10 7/8; Oracle Systems fell 3/8 to 7
7/8; Amgen added 1/2 to 48 1/2; Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 33
3/4.
   Teradata fell 2 to 17 1/2. The company encouraged analysts
yesterday morning not to overestimate its earnings. Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said Prudential-Bache Securities
lowered its 25 cents a share earnings estimate for Teradata's
first quarter. For the quarter a year ago, Teradata had net
income of 17 cents a share including three cents a share from
tax benefits.
   Sizzler Restaurants International rebounded from a 1 1/4
point loss Wednesday. Sizzler shares lost ground when Collins
Foods International said it would begin an exchange offer for
the 34% of Sizzler it does not already own. Analysts
suggested yesterday that the market may have undervalued the
future prospects for Sizzler and Collins. Sizzler shares
gained 1/2 to close at 15 3/4.
   Immunex fell 1 1/2 to 27 7/8. DJPIR reported the Food and
Drug Administration has delayed a decision on Immunex's GMCSF
drug, a genetically engineered white-blood-cell stimulant
used in some bone marrow transplants.
   Applied Biosystems was unchanged at 8 1/4. The company
said it expects to charge $5 million against first quarter
earnings for costs associated with relocating its liquid
chromatography components operations from New Jersey to
California.
   Neworld Bancorp said it expects to report a loss of about
$10 million, or $2.50 a share, for its third quarter compared
to net income of $1.4 million, or 35 cents a share, a year
ago. Neworld attributed the anticipated loss to a $15 million
addition to possible loan loss reserve. Its shares dropped
3/8 to 4.
   Groundwater Technology added 3/4 to 18 3/4. The company
said it has been repurchasing its shares in the past month.
   Telxon was up 7/8 to 10 7/8. Telxon projected fiscal
second quarter operating profit of 20 cents a share compared
with a net loss of 30 cents a share in the quarter a year
ago.
   Lancaster Colony dropped 1 3/4 to 16 3/4 after revealing
late Wednesday that fourth quarter earnings dropped to five
cents a share from 52 cents a share in the quarter last year.
Lancaster said most of the decline was related to charges
associated with certain litigation.
   In-Store Advertising plunged another 1 1/4 to 4 1/2. The
stock went public two months ago at $19 a share.
   Kentucky Medical Insurance dropped another 1 1/4 to 12
after falling 1 3/4 Wednesday. Yesterday's closing price
marks a new 52-week low for Kentucky Medical Insurance.
