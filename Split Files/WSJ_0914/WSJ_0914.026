   NEW YORK -- Playboy Enterprises Inc. is considering
acquiring or investing in Spy, a four-year-old humor
magazine.
   Playboy executives characterized the talks as informal,
but a spokeswoman said there was "real interest" on the part
of Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises, publisher of Playboy
magazine.

   Spy has been seeking an investor, or acquirer, for most of
this year -- without success. Last February, Spy's publisher
Thomas L. Phillips Jr. said he and his partners had retained
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to consider offers from interested
buyers and investors. Mr. Phillips said Spy worked with
Morgan Stanley for about three months, but dropped the
investment banking company after passing on several potential
investors Morgan Stanley proposed.
   However, industry executives said that Morgan Stanley had
overestimated the value investors would put on Spy and that
Spy's owners had, in turn, held out for too high a price.
Morgan Stanley executives did not return calls seeking
comment.
   A Playboy company spokeswoman confirmed recent talks were
held between Mr. Phillips and Michael Perlis, president and
publisher of Playboy. Mr. Perlis wasn't available for
comment. "Spy would be a nice complement to Playboy," said a
Playboy spokeswoman.
   After launching in 1986, Spy gained attention for its
satires on the rich and famous. The magazine's notoriety
reached far beyond its circulation, which Mr. Phillips said
is about 150,000. Spy expanded into book publishing with the
same brand of humor as its magazine, and this year produced
its first TV show for the NBC network.
   In recent months, Spy's advertising volume has fallen,
compared with 1989 levels. Mr. Phillips said that while
advertising is down, the magazine has raised its ad rates and
thus was getting more revenue per page. "People figured we
were in trouble last spring because we were for sale," Mr.
Phillips said. "We weren't and we aren't. We are still a
profitable magazine."
