   BOSTON -- Researchers here identified a brain-chemical
abnormality associated with Huntington's disease, providing a
clue to the inherited disorder's cause and suggesting new
treatment possibilities.
   The finding follows an earlier discovery of the
approximate location of the gene that causes the disease, an
invariably fatal mental and motor deterioration that
typically isn't apparent until midlife. The earlier work made
possible diagnostic tests that can reveal whether a person
has the gene, which makes eventual onset of the disease
almost certain. But there are no preventatives for the
estimated 125,000 Americans carrying the gene, nor effective
treatments for the 25,000 people who already have developed
the disease, which killed folk singer Woody Guthrie.

   Recently, however, scientists have begun to unravel the
brain-chemistry disruption caused by the defective gene,
raising hopes for palliatives. Previous studies have
suggested that the disease causes excessive activation of
so-called NMDA receptors, certain molecules involved in
transmitting chemical messages between brain cells. How the
disease causes the overactivation has been unclear, though.
   The latest study, led by neurologist Flint Beal at
Massachusetts General Hospital, sheds light on that question.
Using a sensitive chemical analyzer, the researchers spotted
an abnormality in the levels of certain substances in the
brains of people who had died from Huntington's disease. In
particular, the finding indicates that the disease lowers
levels of kynurenic acid, which is thought to protect against
overactivation of NMDA receptors.
   The discovery opens the door to "more possibilities for
developing therapies" for the disease, said Robert McBurney,
vice president, research, at Cambridge NeuroScience Research,
Cambridge, Mass. His company and several other concerns are
developing experimental drugs to block overactivation of NMDA
receptors that accompanies strokes and certain other
disorders. Current drug candidates, however, may have side
effects that rule out their use over long periods to mitigate
Huntington's disease.
   The Boston study, published in the current issue of the
Journal of Neurochemistry, may lead to better candidates --
perhaps drugs to raise levels of kynurenic acid. It also
should help scientists more accurately replicate the disease
process in animals, said Dr. Beal, which would speed up
treatment research. Moreover, researchers at ESA Corp.,
Bedford, Mass., which makes the chemical analyzer used in the
study, hope to develop a simple and cheap diagnostic test for
the disease based on the distinctive pattern of neurochemical
abnormalities it causes.
