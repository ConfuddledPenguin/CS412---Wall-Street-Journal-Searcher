   TOKYO -- High demand pushed August steel production in
Japan up 4.3% to 9.1 million metric tons, compared with
year-earlier levels, but the output was down 0.5% from the
previous month, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. A
metric ton is about 2,204.6 pounds.
   While seasonal energy conservation measures brought August
output down from the previous month's total, a spokesman said
the federation doesn't expect the rise in crude-oil prices
that followed imposition of United Nations sanctions on Iraq
to affect production.
