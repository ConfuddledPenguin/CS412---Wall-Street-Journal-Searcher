   BELLEVUE, Wash. -- First Mutual Savings Bank said it would
incur a roughly $1.2 million after-tax charge in the third
quarter ending Sept. 30, reflecting a more conservative
accounting treatment of certain deferred loan-servicing
rights.
   The thrift reported net income of $375,645, or 30 cents a
share, in the year-earlier third quarter. It added that,
despite the charge, it would remain in compliance with
federal regulatory capital standards.
