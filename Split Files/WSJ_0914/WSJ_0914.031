   PARIS -- During the booming 1980s the richest countries
got richer while the poorest countries got poorer. During the
uncertain 1990s the richest countries may not get much
richer, but the poorest countries will almost certainly get
poorer.
   That's the general conclusion emerging from a 11-day
United Nations conference, ending today, on the special
problems of the world's 41 poorest nations, home to 420
million people. The conference will issue a report calling
for rich countries to give the poor more aid, and for poor
countries to spend that aid more wisely. A similar conference
here in 1981 issued a similar report, called the Substantial
New Program of Action. It was largely ignored, and things got
worse.

   "We represent despair," says A.H.G. Mohiuddin,
Bangladesh's ambassador to the U.N. "Our situation has only
deteriorated."
   That deterioration is likely to continue. The United
Nations estimates that oil price rises connected with the
Persian Gulf crisis could add more than $1 billion to the oil
bill of the poorest countries this year and next. The U.N.
had figured that these countries, already saddled with $70
billion in foreign debt, would need extra aid inflows of $11
billion by 1995 to get them started on the path to recovery.
The U.N. says an oil price of $25 a barrel increases that
figure to more than $14 billion. For the poorest countries to
reach a decent growth rate of 5% a year, they would need aid
from the rich totaling $36 billion a year, triple what they
received last year.
   The poor countries claim, with some justification, that
the rich countries haven't kept their promises. The 1981
program called for generous debt rescheduling or forgiveness,
only some of which has happened, and called for rich
countries to devote 0.15% of their gross national product to
help the poorest countries. While some European countries
have done so, the U.S. and Japan have fallen well short, and
the total reached only 0.09%, right where it was in 1981. The
U.N. says that if everyone had met the 0.15% target, the poor
countries would have been $40 billion better off between 1982
and 1988.
   The poor were also hit hard by two big oil price increases
and the collapse in price of most basic commodities, often
their only source of export income. During recessions, rich
countries tended to make it hard for poor countries to sell
their products: The poorest countries' share of world trade
in manufactured goods dropped to 0.3% from 1.3% during the
1980s.
   The rich countries claim, also with some justification,
that aid to poor countries is often wasted by non-democratic
governments. Leading industrial countries wanted strong
pledges from the poor countries that they would move more
quickly toward democracy. "What we've learned over the past
decade," says Stephane Hessel, a former French ambassador who
helped organize the 1981 conference, "is that democracy is
the essential element in development. The lesson of the 1990s
is that democracy isn't the luxury of the rich. Rather, the
absence of democracy is a luxury that poor countries can no
longer afford."
   But despite the sweep of democracy through Eastern Europe,
the poor countries still bristle at such suggestions.
Nigerian delegate Alhaji Abubakar Abdulkadir suggested that
the East-West cold war was being replaced by a North-South
battle. Indeed, just before he spoke on Wednesday the
conference was disrupted by an unseemly quarrel between the
Iraqi delegate and the delegate from the exiled government of
Kuwait, which the United Nations still recognizes as the
legitimate government there. The Iraqi delegate pointed out
that the $2.5 billion the U.S. was spending every month on
troops in Saudi Arabia would be better spent on poor
countries. The delegate from the United Arab Emirates
responded acidly that development aid "doesn't necessarily
mean you have to occupy another country."
   Delegates were still arguing last night over language in
the final report concerning political responsibilities. The
rich industrialized countries want the report to single out
as the best target for development "the individual . . .
which thus entails respect for and promotion of all human
rights," and add that development only works where there is
"democratic consensus."
   The poor countries have countered with language saying
that they all will "select . . . their own model of
development and ownership of means of production," and will
regard any political advice as strictly optional.
   U.N. officials were working on a compromise on this
language, and said they were confident they could also
include specific pledges of more aid in the final document.
But they also recall that the 1981 report had plenty of
pledges.
   "We thought things would get a lot better after 1981 and
they got worse," says Yves Berthelot, deputy
secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development. "It is simply not acceptable that one-tenth
of the world's population continue to be marginalized."
