   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. extended its debt-swap offer to
bondholders for the third time amid signs it is considering
filing for bankruptcy-court protection, which could
jeopardize a proposed $430 million bailout by its Japanese
partners.
   If the company seeks court protection -- a mark of
dishonor to Japanese businessmen -- Southland would put at
risk its agreement with Ito-Yokado, which operates the
company's 7-Eleven convenience stores in Japan. Ito-Yokado
has agreed to buy 70% of Southland if the company first
restructures its $1.8 billion of publicly traded debt. But
the company has got only partial approval from bondholders
for its debt-swap proposals, making it more likely that
Southland may have to file for Chapter 11 protection.

   Analysts in Japan couldn't recall an instance where a
Japanese retailer has acquired a company that filed a
bankruptcy petition. "Southland's in a bind," said Andy
Leinoff, an analyst in the Vermont office of McCarthy
Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc., a bond research firm. "The Japanese
seem to have an honorable aversion to bankruptcy."
   During the second extension, which ended Wednesday,
Southland made so little progress winning over bondholders
that observers say a pre-packaged bankruptcy-law filing --
wherein holdouts could lose their rights -- is the company's
only hope. At the end of the 18-day period, for instance,
only 49.8% of the company's 16.75%-interest notes had been
tendered, a gain of just 3.5 percentage points from the prior
extension.
   The company remains far short of the 95% approval in each
of five classes of bondholders it needs to complete the
Ito-Yokado bailout. In a pre-packaged filing, by contrast,
Southland would need only two-thirds approval. In a
successful pre-packaged proceeding, a company enters
bankruptcy court with a reorganization plan already drawn up
and approved by creditors representing two-thirds of its
debt. Holdouts are bound by court order to go along with the
plan.
   Nevertheless, in extending their offer 13 days, to Sept.
25, Southland officials reaffirmed their commitment to win
bondholder approval, and refused to discuss a bankruptcy-law
petition as an option.
   In Japan, Ito-Yokado officials extended their buy-out
offer, which was set to expire Sept. 15, to Sept. 25 to
coincide with the new deadline for Southland's debt-swap
offer. But a company spokesman declined to say whether the
company would extend the deadline any further. The spokesman
said he hadn't heard of any Southland proposal for a
pre-packaged filing.
   But the chairman of the Southland bondholder committee
said the company is already seeking Securities and Exchange
Commission approval of a bankruptcy reorganization plan. "The
main reason for this latest extension is that we want to get
well over the two-thirds approval level so that if we go this
pre-packaged bankruptcy route, we can do it quickly," said
John Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp. A
pre-packaged proceeding can be completed in a matter of
weeks.
   Mr. Gordon, who has been helping Southland woo holdouts,
said that SEC approval of the plan is expected late next
week. But he said he still hopes that a bankruptcy petition
won't be necessary. "Once bondholders who are taking a
show-me posture see these bankruptcy documents right in front
of their nose, maybe we won't have to do it," he said.
   But Southland still has a long way to go. When the latest
offer expired Wednesday, Southland had received tenders from
holders of 53.42% of its 18% notes, 65.27% of its 16.50%
notes, 67.65% of its 15.75% notes, and 92.67% of its 13.50%
notes. Only holders of the company's preferred stock exceeded
the minimum requirements of the deal, tendering 94.53% of the
shares outstanding. Only two-thirds approval of preferred
shareholders was required.
   "Over the past two weeks, we've succeeded in identifying
the vast majority of Southland security holders who have not
yet tendered their securities," said Clark Matthews, chief
financial officer. Now, he said, "we will intensify our
efforts to urge them to tender their securities."
   If Southland keeps falling short, one alternative to
seeking bankruptcy-law protection would be for Ito-Yokado to
lower its requirement that holders of 95% of all bonds
approve the deal. But that would make owning 70% of Southland
less attractive to Ito-Yokado, because high interest rates
would continue to be paid on the untendered bonds. In any
case, the Ito-Yokado spokesman said the company intended to
keep the 95% approval requirement.
   In Japan, analysts said that Southland's continuing
failure to reach an agreement with its bondholders was
discouraging investment in Ito-Yokado stock. Ito-Yokado
"won't continue to be so generous forever," said Takayuki
Suzuki, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. Although
Mr. Suzuki said it's unlikely the Japanese retailer would
back out of the offer, the company may toughen its position
before the fourth quarter ends.
   Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
threatened hostile takeover. But increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out. That led
to the buy-out proposal, which would give Ito-Yokado a 70%
stake in Southland. Bondholders would retain 25% of the
company, while the founding Thompson family would get the
remaining 5%.
   Southland went into default on its $1.8 billion of
publicly traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced
into filing for bankruptcy-law protection when the bondholder
committee endorsed the terms of the current exchange offer,
the fourth proposed by the company.
