   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. has scaled back some of
its 1991 model prices increases, slashing more than $600 from
the previously announced prices of certain Taurus models.
   The move indicates that Ford believed its original price
increases were too steep for today's highly competitive car
market.

   "I think Ford is listening to what's going on in the
market place," said Jim Hoffer, manager of Jordan Ford in
Mishawaka, Ind. Mr. Hoffer, who was critical of Ford's
original price strategy, said he's "very happy" with the new
prices.
   A Ford spokesman said that the new price list "reflects
changes in the market and what competitors have done."
   Some of the biggest rollbacks came on the high-volume
Taurus midsized models. The Taurus, a mainstay of Ford's
product line, has come under increasing competitive pressure
in the past year. Sales of the five-year-old model are down
11.4% through the end of August, nearly twice the overall
market decline.
   Ford said the cheapest 1991 Taurus L sedan now will have a
suggested list price of $13,352, up 5.6%, or $712, from a
year ago. But that is $365 less than the original 1991 price
of $13,717 that Ford announced to dealers in August. The 1991
Taurus GL wagon had an even sharper price rollback, dropping
to $14,990 from an initial 1991 price of $15,599. A year ago,
the GL wagon started at $14,722.
   Even after the rollbacks, the Taurus faces stiff price
competition. Last week, Honda Motor Co. announced a mere $200
increase for its Accord model, which was beefed up in size
and power a year ago to compete head on with the Taurus in
the midpriced family car market. The cheapest 1991 Accord
with an automatic transmission will start at $13,295. That is
$57 less than a comparable Taurus. Before the price rollback,
the Honda cost $422 less.
   Yet another Taurus competitor, the 1991 Chevrolet Lumina,
will start at $12,870.
   Ford had earlier tried to undercut these rivals by
announcing a $750 rebate on the 1991 Taurus even before it
hit the showrooms. General Motors Corp. also has announced
discounts of $500 to $1,000 on 1991 models.
   Ford chopped prices on some other key models, too. The
base price of the cheapest 1991 Thunderbird will jump 2.3% to
$15,318. Earlier, it had been slated for a 5.4% price
increase.
   The price of the cheapest four-door, four-wheel-drive Ford
Explorer will be $18,905, down from the previously scheduled
price of $19,066. The latest price still represents a 1.6%
increase from the Explorer model's $18,605 introductory price
in March.
   The new list isn't all good news for car buyers. On a few
models, Ford actually boosted prices from the earlier 1991
list. Consider the 1991 Mustang LX convertible, which now has
a base price of $16,222, compared with $15,852 on the
earlier, August price list. The latest increase means the
Mustang convertible will jump 7.1%, or $1,081, from the
year-ago base price of $15,141.
