   PHILADELPHIA -- Researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center said they "permanently reversed"
diabetes in 10 of 13 laboratory rats by transplanting
insulin-producing cells into the thymus gland of the animals.
   The novel approach of using the thymus as the transplant
site could have promising implications for treatment of
insulin-dependent diabetes in humans, which occurs early in
life. If developed further and adapted successfully, it also
could contribute to more effective transplantation of other
human organs, such as hearts, livers and kidneys.

   Insulin, which the body needs to metabolize sugar, is
produced by clumps of islet cells in the pancreas that
resemble raisins in bread. In insulin-dependent diabetics,
these indigenous cells have been singled out, attacked and
destroyed by a process that still isn't fully understood.
   Diabetes is a killer disease. Its life-threatening
complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure
and peripheral vascular disease. It's also a leading cause of
blindness. About one million of the 12 million Americans who
are diabetic have insulin dependency. The others suffer from
a different and less severe kind of disorder, and there isn't
any indication that the transplant technique developed at
Penn would apply to their treatment.
   The Penn experiments, described in today's issue of
Science magazine, used laboratory rats that weren't diabetic
by heredity. Instead, the researchers induced diabetes
intravenously two or three weeks before transplantation.
Survival of transplanted islet cells for 100 days would be
considered "permanent" reversal of diabetes. At Penn, the
islets survived for 200 days before most of the animals were
killed to permit further tests. A few rats continued to
produce insulin for 18 months.
   Paul Lacy, a recognized pioneer in islet transplantation
at Washington University in St. Louis, said he thinks the
Penn results are "extremely interesting," but much work
remains to be done. "The next question," Dr. Lacy said, "is
what will happen when they do this in BB rats," which are
genetically bred to be diabetic. The procedure also would
have to be tested in dogs or monkeys before any program for
humans could be undertaken, he said.
   For more than a decade, diabetes researchers have used the
liver, kidney and spleen as islet-transplant sites. But in
these previous experiments, conducted at Penn and several
other institutions, the transplanted cells were almost always
rejected within days unless shielded by heavy doses of
immunosuppressive drugs.
   The Penn researchers, led by surgery Prof. Ali Naji,
believe they are the first to transplant islet cells into the
thymus. Only a single dose of an immunosuppressant was used.
Dr. Naji said he and his team chose the thymus because they
suspected the ductless gland to be a "privileged" transplant
site that is "protected" from the body's usual process for
rejecting foreign tissue.
   The role of the thymus is still not fully understood, but
it may contribute to the body's defenses in early years. The
Penn experiments suggest that the thymus, unlike the liver or
the kidney, doesn't set off loud alarms that summon the
body's natural defense mechanisms to attack transplanted
cells. As a result, the study concludes, using the thymus can
reduce sharply the need for immunosuppressive drugs that can
cause life-threatening side effects, such as cancer or
infection.
   Perhaps more important, the tests indicate that
transplants into the thymus can help prevent rejection of
later transplants elsewhere in the body. After 200 days, the
team transplanted new islet cells into the kidneys of some
animals. By that point, the immune system didn't recognize
the new islets as foreign tissue. "The cells weren't
rejected," said Andrew M. Posselt, an author of the study,
"even though they were outside the protective environment of
the thymus."
   Clyde F. Barker, Penn's chief of surgery and an author of
the study, said the thymus technique could prove important
"as a prelude to other kinds of transplants" that someday may
be done "safely with very little immunosuppression or none at
all."
   Dr. Naji said the next phase of the project will be to
test the transplant procedure on animals that are diabetic by
heredity. That way, the researchers can determine if the
thymus also provides an effective sanctuary against the
mechanism that attacks and destroys indigenous islet cells in
the pancreas.
   The human thymus, lodged in the upper chest cavity, is
prominent at puberty but shrinks as the body ages. Its
reduced size might present some challenges, but Dr. Naji said
he thinks the thymus is probably still "less inconvenient"
for transplantation than the body's other privileged sites,
which include the brain, the eye and the testicle.
   The Penn study is the second diabetes-related discovery to
be announced this week. In Nature magazine, researchers at
Yale University and the University of California at San
Francisco identified a protein that plays a key role in the
development of insulin-dependent diabetes, thus raising the
prospect of screening to find young people who are at risk
years before onset of the disease.
