   Con artists have found a new hunting ground: telephone
services using 900, 976 and other numbers that bill the
caller.
   The most prevalent scams offer guaranteed credit cards or
credit repair, easy-to-get loans, and business or job
opportunities. In general, consumers call an advertised
number to hear a recorded message and are charged on their
monthly phone bill. In a spot check of 144 pay-per-call
services this spring, watchdog group Consumer Action found
that most of the messages were rip-offs.

   "Consumers end up spending $30 to $40 for information they
could pull out of a phone book," says Stephen Texeira, a
researcher for the San Francisco consumer group. "A
`government jobs hot line' gave out numbers for agencies in
California -- for $20."
   The rapid growth of the services has led to crackdowns by
regulators on the federal and local level. Late last month,
the Postal Service and the U.S. attorney's office in Des
Moines, Iowa, won a preliminary injunction against two
promoters who enticed more than 80,000 people to dial a 900
number at $9.90 a call. The duo were accused of mailing 1.5
million postcards that included the 900 number and told
recipients they had won a Mercedes-Benz, a Hawaiian vacation
or a mink coat.
   Postal attorney Geoff Drucker says callers later were
mailed a solicitation for such magazines as Atlantic and
Time, and a request to send a $150 "refundable deposit" to a
post office box to secure hotel rooms for three nights. But
the promised "vacation extravaganza" included no airfare, no
meals and no other expenses.
   Lawyers for the two men contend the mailing was a
legitimate solicitation for magazine subscriptions, and that
callers could have mailed back a postcard instead of making
the $9.90 call -- an option used by more than 100,000 people
on the mailing list. A hearing in the case is scheduled for
next Tuesday.
   Earlier this summer, New York Attorney General Robert
Abrams put an end to a service that gave purported tips on
how to win the state lottery -- at an average $2.25 a call.
And in Atlanta, a federal court, acting on the Federal Trade
Commission's first complaint involving 900 numbers, shut down
a bogus employment line about a month ago. When callers
dialed a toll-free number that advertised high-paying jobs,
they were instructed to dial a 976 or 900 number. They
weren't told, however, that they would be socked $15 to $18
for the second call.
   The stepped-up enforcement has sparked a debate over
whether tougher federal regulation is needed and whether
phone companies should monitor all 900 messages and refuse to
bill consumers for questionable programs. Although
information-service providers and phone companies generally
reject regulation as the answer, many worry that the
continued spread of rip-offs and sleazy programs could choke
the fledgling 900 industry. The bad reputation of the
industry is making some local phone companies reluctant about
handling the billing of the services.
   "This is a growing problem," says Mr. Abrams, who figures
his office has more than 100 telephone scam investigations
and related inquiries open. New York regulators "took
protective steps, but now we're finding that a lot of
suspicious telemarketing is shifting to the federal level,
900 numbers," and away from intrastate numbers such as 540
and 976 lines.
   Mr. Abrams and other attorneys general around the country
are joining the chorus of consumer groups urging the Federal
Communications Commission to adopt consumer safeguards. They
also have asked long-distance carriers to police themselves.
Among other things, they would like full disclosure of costs
in any advertising for caller-paid phone numbers, and a
chance for callers to hang up without being charged for calls
that cost more than a couple of dollars. In New York, for
instance, callers must get a clear, brief explanation of
charges at the start of a call and time to hang up before the
meter starts running on any call that costs $3.50 or more.
   Barry Cutler, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, agrees that consumers need more safeguards. "This
dandelion approach -- going after the roots one at a time --
is not going to be a successful strategy for the 900
industry," he says. The FTC issued a consumer alert in July,
and Mr. Cutler now suggests an intensive "weed-control"
program involving phone companies, the FCC, information
providers and others.
   The FCC is reviewing the matter, but isn't inclined to
push for new rules -- especially if industry self-policing,
backed up by the FTC and law enforcement agencies, can
control the problem.
   Rep. Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) has been leading a push for
greater federal regulation of 900 service. The House
Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee is taking a first
step with a hearing on 900 rip-offs tentatively scheduled for
next Wednesday. The possibility of legislation, however, is
still remote.
   The four long-distance carriers that provide 900 service
are split over how much to monitor programs that run on their
networks. But they all acknowledge that, even with aggressive
monitoring, problems can slip through. Some enterprising
programs have figured out how to circumvent phone company
prohibitions on obscene material. "There are a whole bunch of
information lines that run Monday through Friday, but on
Friday nights turn into sex lines," says one 900 industry
executive.
   "That's certainly not unheard of," confirms Andrea West,
who heads marketing for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
900 service.
   Among the four carriers, only MCI Communications Corp.
doesn't screen messages before allowing them to run on its
network nor does it monitor messages afterwards. MCI cites
First Amendment concerns. The company says it keeps tabs only
on the level of complaints it receives. MCI's trigger
mechanism isn't particularly sensitive: Both the jobs line
that the FTC attacked and the sweepstakes line the Postal
Service went after were carried -- and billed -- by MCI.
   Gene Eidenberg, an executive vice president, acknowledges
the approach has been too narrow. MCI, he says, is planning
to begin a push for industrywide 900 standards modeled after
California regulation. Along with requiring information
providers to disclose the price and giving callers time to
hang up, MCI is advocating that information providers certify
that their programs are lawful and comply with local phone
companies' billing and collection restrictions. Mr. Eidenberg
says there's a need for a system to track consumer complaints
as well as a separate prefix for "adult" programs and
restrictions on programming aimed at children.
   AT&amp;T, US Sprint Communications Corp., a unit of United
Telecommunications Inc., and Telesphere Communications Inc.
all say they monitor 900 messages and have kicked certain
programs off their networks. AT&amp;T, for instance, cites a
"Call Santa" program it halted in Seattle nearly two years
ago. Television ads instructed children too young to dial
themselves to hold the receiver to the TV set, which emitted
tones to call service.
   The information-services industry itself is working to
avert both state and federal regulation by devising standards
for program providers to police themselves. Restrictions on
advertising that encourages children to dial caller-paid
programs, requirements for clear price disclosures, and seals
of approval are among the measures being considered at both
the Information Industry Association and the National
Association for Information Services. The latter group was
organized earlier this year, mainly in reaction to the 900
industry's sordid reputation and the growing threat of state
and federal regulation.
   The telephone information industry has been pressing to
expand beyond dial-a-porn and "infotainment" and into the
mainstream of American business, offering companies a
profitable alternative to 800 service. But the reputation of
900 and 976 lines as well as the reluctance of local phone
companies to bill consumers for products sold over the phone
are proving to be barriers.
   "The scams and sex lines have certainly given the industry
a bad start," says Glenn Lebowitz, president of Optima Direct
Inc., a Washington direct-marketing and campaign-management
concern that has been a pioneer in 900 programs. "But 900 is
too attractive a vehicle for the big guys to stay out."
   Nevertheless, increased consumer complaints could
encourage the local phone companies to pull the plug if
long-distance carriers don't impose tougher regulation.
"Right now, the industry is living on the edge," Mr. Lebowitz
says. "If 900 causes enough aggravation, local phone
companies might decide they don't want to be part of it."
