   PRINCETON, N.J. -- The David Sarnoff Research Center
signed a new agreement valued at more than $100 million to
continue research and development work with the consumer
electronics unit of Paris-based Thomson S.A.
   Under the multi-year agreement, the Sarnoff Center will
continue pursuing new technologies for television systems,
displays and TV receivers carrying the RCA name, officials
said.

   The Sarnoff Center, now a subsidiary of California-based
SRI International, was started at Princeton in 1942 by the
RCA Corp. Following RCA's acquisition by General Electric
Co., the consumer electronics business was acquired by
Thomson in 1987.
   The Sarnoff Center is also part of a major consortium
trying to develop high definition television systems, in
which Thomson is also involved. In 1989, the Sarnoff Center
posted revenue of $77.4 million.
