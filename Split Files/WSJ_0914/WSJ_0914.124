   Corroon &amp; Black shares sank yesterday amid Wall Street
speculation that Aon Corp.'s surprise bid for the insurance
brokerage firm could collapse if it's rejected by Corroon's
board.
   Analysts believe that a bidding war over Corroon &amp; Black
isn't very likely. Nonetheless, the shares of both Aon and
Willis Faber PLC, Corroon's other suitor, declined in active
trading as well.

   "All the shareholders are looking at the worst possible
scenarios," said Michael Smith, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman in New York.
   Corroon &amp; Black had previously agreed to merge with Willis
Faber in a $33.49-a-share, or $703 million, stock swap. But
Aon's $40-a-share, or $840 million, proposal poses a hefty
challenge to the Willis Faber offer, which analysts believe
is favored by the board.
   In a letter delivered Wednesday to Richard Miller,
Corroon's chairman and chief executive officer, Patrick G.
Ryan, Aon's chairman, president and chief executive, had
stressed that he wouldn't pursue any deal that was opposed by
Corroon's board.
   "If Corroon's board rejects Aon's offer, Mr. Ryan could go
away," said Alice Cornish, an analyst with Northington
Partners. "It has to be a friendly deal because an insurance
broker's main assets are people. I'm sure he's well aware of
that because he has acquired other brokers."
   While there's little chance that Willis Faber will walk
away from its bid, the company said it wouldn't sweeten the
terms of its proposed merger with Corroon despite Aon's
higher bid for the New York-based broker.
   "Our position is firm. We're still working toward the
merger," said Peter Stevens, a Willis Faber spokesman. "We
have no intention of changing our minds."
   Willis Faber's resolve may be strong, but its offer lost
appeal as its stock slipped 9%. The drop sent the per-share
value of Willis Faber's merger offer to about $10 less than
Chicago-based Aon's $40-a-share cash offer for Corroon.
Willis Faber, which has about 237 million shares outstanding,
planned to issue 160 million more in the merger. Willis Faber
would need to issue another 60 million shares to expand its
share swap to match Aon's offer.
   Analysts and investment bankers said Willis Faber has been
squeezed by Aon's surprise bid of Wednesday. If Willis Faber
changes its mind and sweetens its offer, per-share earnings,
already facing dilution under the current merger offer, would
be further diluted. And if Corroon &amp; Black opts for Aon,
Willis Faber, Britian's second-largest insurance broker,
would be left without the strategic U.S. tie it is so avidly
seeking.
   "Whichever way it turns, Willis shareholders get diluted
earnings," said Julianne Jessup, an analyst at Barclay de
Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. "Willis is in a very bad
position."
   In late London trading, Willis Faber shares were quoted at
210 pence, down 21 pence on the day. Under the proposed
merger, holders of New York-based Corroon &amp; Black, the
fifth-largest U.S. insurance broker, would receive 7.8 Willis
Faber shares, currently valued at $30.83, for each of their
20.5 million common shares.
   Corroon stock slipped back $1.375 from Wednesday's big
gain, to close at $36.25; Aon shares dropped for a second
straight day since the proposal was disclosed, closing off
$1.125 at $31.875.
   "I wouldn't want to be in the position of the Corroon &amp;
Black board," said Allan Nichols, an analyst at James Capel &amp;
Co. "I've detected tremendous enthusiasm among Corroon
people; they really want to do the deal with Willis. But with
a $10 per share difference in price, there's also the board's
duty to shareholders. I think the vote is going to be very
close."
   Corroon said its board will meet next week to evaluate the
Aon offer. "We just can't dismiss an offer to purchase the
corporation," said Robert Cuthbert, a first vice president
and Coroon's chief financial officer.
   Mr. Smith at Shearson believes Corroon's board has only
two choices here: Accept Aon's offer or find a white knight
that will outbid Aon.
   Willis Faber apparently is banking on the tax-free aspect
of its proposed share swap -- against the taxable status of
Aon's cash offer -- and the vision of a global brokerage
network that would be created by the merger. The resultant
firm, Willis Corroon PLC, would be the fourth-largest
insurance brokerage in the world. Generally, a broker assists
corporate clients in obtaining insurance coverage.
   Aon, a health, life and accident insurance company, also
operates Rollins Burdick Hunter Group, the seventh-largest
U.S. insurance broker. A combination with Corroon &amp; Black
would create the fourth-largest U.S. insurance brokerage.
There would be significant overlap between the two operations
since both firms cater to medium-sized and large
corporations.
   The proposed stock swap with Willis Faber would be
attractive to Corroon's management and employees, who
together own 30% of the firm's stock. Mr. Smith at Shearson
believes "American cash has some attraction for these folks
over a piece of paper demoninated in another country's
currency." Corroon's shareholders would receive American
depositary receipts, denominated in British pounds.
   "We think the offer is superior," said Aon's Mr. Ryan in
an interview yesterday, adding that he is confident Aon's bid
will prevail.
