   TOKYO -- Japan's Big Four securities firms -- Nomura
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.
and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- drastically lowered pretax
earnings projections for the fiscal half year ending Sept.
30.
   Nomura, the world's largest securities firm, said its
pretax profit would drop 50%, to 125 billion yen ($905
million) in the first half of this year from 248.9 billion
yen in the like period last year. Daiwa said its pretax
profit would fall 62%, to about 65 billion yen from 171
billion. Nikko estimated its earnings would decline 73%, to
around 35 billion yen from 130.3 billion, and Yamaichi said
its profit would plunge 75%, to 30 billion yen from 117.9
billion.

   The projected profits are about a third of what the firms
previously had forecast.
   Pretax earnings are the clearest indication of the firms'
operating results.
   The sharp revisions underscore the damage to the industry
done by the steep reversals on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this
year. The harm to securities companies is broad. First-half
pretax profits for the 25 securities companies listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange are expected to fall an average of 50%,
according to a survey in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's
largest economic daily.
   Officials at the big Japanese securities houses cite
shrinking trading volume and deflated stock prices as the
main reasons for the declines. On average, two-thirds fewer
stocks are changing hands on the Tokyo exchange each day than
were traded at the end of last year. That bites deeply in
Tokyo because nearly half of securities industry revenue here
comes from equity brokerage commissions.
   Business isn't expected to pick up, either. For the full
year ending March 31, 1991, Nomura pretax profit is seen
falling 43% to 280 billion yen. Net income is predicted to
plummet 41% to 130 billion yen.
