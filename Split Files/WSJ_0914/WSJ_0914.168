   Tokyo stocks finished softer Thursday after a volatile
last trading day for September futures and options contracts.
Arbitrage selling in the afternoon was largely responsible
for the Nikkei Index's decline, traders said.
   Friday's opening prices will be used as the special
quotation on those contracts.

   London shares finished a dreary session lower, as
investors were unsettled by the prospect of further
instability from the Persian Gulf and a number of other
issues.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 141.06 points, or
0.56%, to 25075.08.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index fell another 192.34
points to close the morning session at 24882.74.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
550 million shares, in line with 546.4 million Wednesday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 538 to 421, while 167 issues
were unchanged.
   The broader-based index of all issues listed on the first
section outperformed the Nikkei. The Tokyo Stock Price Index
slipped 1.04 points, or 0.05%, to 1912.68.
   The second section index rose 6.45 points, or 0.18%, to
3598.00. Volume in the section was estimated at 7.5 million
shares, up from 6.9 million shares.
   Traders said they had been anticipating Nomura Securities
and the other Big Four brokerage houses to aggressively try
to place at least 150 billion yen ($1.09 billion) in new
investment trust funds on the market Thursday.
   But the brokerage houses reversed course after initial
early morning buying, as institutional and investment trust
fund selling pressure came in to counter their efforts.
   "It's obvious that no one's going to follow even if we
were to ram this market up," one trader at a Big Four firm
said early in the morning. Institutions and trust funds
"don't want to keep buying at these high levels."
   Instead, especially in the afternoon, large brokerage
houses were seen directing funds toward liquidating arbitrage
positions, according to Eichi Hayashi, a futures dealer at
Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   Nomura was also seen selling some blue-chip options,
further damping sentiment, observers said. "Nomura and the
other Big Four were expected to give support. But when they
didn't, the market got very disappointed," Mr. Hayashi said.
   Nomura also placed a large buy program on the Nikkei,
traders said, which helped return some buoyancy to the index.
   But most of the afternoon activity was directed toward
preparation for Friday's special quotation, said a futures
and options trader at Jardine Fleming (Securities).
   Brokerage buying has targeted Marubeni Corp. since early
Wednesday. The stock rose 18 yen to 673 yen Thursday.
   Tokyu Group companies also attracted interest, with Tokyu
Department Store rising 130 yen to 1660 yen, and Tokyu Corp.
up 90 yen to 1490 yen.
   Minebea, which rose 40 yen to 1110 yen, continued to be a
popular play.
   Also firmer were financial shares such as Mitsubishi Bank,
up 10 yen to 1900 yen, and Bank of Yokohama, up 90 yen to
1160 yen.
   Speculative issue Sanrio gained 270 yen to 6630 yen.
   Separately, after the close of trading, each of the Big
Four brokerages, Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko, announced
sharp, downward revisions in half-year earnings predictions.
   The firms cited severely lower commission income because
of the market's recent low volume and other negative economic
effects from the Gulf crisis.
   In London, dealers said the market was wracked by crude
oil's climb above $31 a barrel, the persistent wrangling to
slice the U.S. budget deficit, and uncertainties regarding
sterling's entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System.
   "The market is highly vulnerable," said one market maker,
adding that until Wednesday, investors had begun to believe
that the situation in the Middle East had simmered down. But
with Iran's calls for a holy war a day ago, the crisis was
thrown back into the spotlight once again, stopping any fresh
interest.
   And until these major tangles are resolved, commentators
suggested that investors would have little reason to modify
existing portfolios.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
15.2 points to 2127.1. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
fell 10.4 points to 1632.9. Volume was 335.4 million shares,
down from 434.7 million issues Wednesday.
   Traders said they had hoped for some guidance from Wall
Street's opening, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average
drifted lower in early trading.
   Volume remained painfully low, dealers complained, as a
slew of earnings reports failed to inspire much trading.
Moreover, July average earnings and August unemployment data
were largely ignored by the directionless market.
   In trading, Coats Viyella, a textile concern, said
first-half pretax profit slipped 0.5% to #54.9 million
($102.1 million), ahead of expectations. The stock gained 8
pence to 99 pence.
   After sliding 40 pence a day earlier on disappointing
earnings, industrial conglomerate BTR rebounded 7 pence to
325 pence in what traders termed a technical correction from
deeply oversold positions. Nearly five million issues were
traded.
   But market makers said the broader market continued to
suffer from BTR's results, on thoughts that if a well-managed
company like BTR could muster only a 6.6% profit gain, other
companies must be set for large-scale earnings
disappointments.
   RTZ said net profit attributable to shareholders fell 3.6%
to #269 million, at the bottom half of market forecasts. RTZ
finished off 9 pence at 439 pence.
   Willis Faber, an insurance broker, said it remains
committed to its $33.51 a share offer for U.S. counterpart
Corroon &amp; Black, despite the emergence of a rival offer from
Aon Corp. for $40 a share. Willis Faber fell 21 pence to 210
pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Milan, lower in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Madrid, and flat
to marginally higher in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
slipped.
   And shares closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Seoul and Wellington, and higher in Manila and Taipei.
