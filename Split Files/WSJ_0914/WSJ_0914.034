   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd.,
Malaysia's telecommunications monopoly, received regulatory
approval for a stock offering that represents the country's
biggest privatization proposal.
   The state-owned company plans to offer 470.5 million
shares, or about 24% of the company, to investors at 5
Malaysian dollars each (US$1.86). All but 147.9 million of
the shares to be offered to the public will be placed with
local institutions and STM employees.

   STM will list a total of 1.97 billion shares, with the
government retaining roughly 76% through a holding company,
Minister of Finance Inc.
   Analysts had anticipated the government's decision to
place the majority of the issue to buffer the soft Malaysian
market from a flood of new shares. Many analysts had expected
the shares to be offered at M$4 each, given the market's
substantial recent decline.
   "The pricing is pretty tight," said one Malaysian analyst.
"It doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the investor."
   But STM Executive Chairman Tan Sri Datuk Mohamad Rashdan
Haji Baba said the market's downturn shouldn't hinder the
issue. "Given the steady growth of basic telecommunication
services, even during the recession years of 1985 and 1986,
we can expect the industry's growth to be strong in the long
term," he said.
