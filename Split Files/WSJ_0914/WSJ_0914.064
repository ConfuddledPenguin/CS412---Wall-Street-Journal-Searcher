   WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein's offer of free oil to
developing countries, provided they come and get it, shows
that he understands whose economies he has hurt the most.
   The Iraqi president's strong-arm tactics in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, his Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent United Nations embargo
against Iraq have caused oil prices to rise above $30 a
barrel, a 50% increase from prices early in the year.

   Those who are most pressed by these higher prices are
oil-importing developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe that are struggling to reform
their economies -- nations such as Zambia, Bangladesh,
Brazil, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   In addition, more-expensive oil is expected to slow growth
in industrialized countries and push up interest rates and
inflation rates. That means developing countries will suffer
from weaker markets for their exports and more-difficult
market conditions for borrowing money.
   As the World Bank says in a preliminary analysis of the
impact of higher oil prices, "the majority of developing
countries . . . will find it difficult to raise the
additional resources to meet the higher cost of oil imports
and larger interest payments on their variable-rate external
debt." The agency also worries that greater economic hardship
"could undermine public acceptance" of economic reform
programs.
   While the recent increase in prices isn't nearly as large
as those of 1974 and 1979, developing countries aren't as
well-positioned as the industrialized nations to deal with
it. The World Bank says developing countries now account for
28% of world oil consumption, a substantial 55% increase from
the oil shock days of 1973, when they accounted for only 18%.
   Of course, not all developing countries are being hurt.
Some oil-producing developing countries, such as Mexico,
Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, will benefit from higher
oil prices.
   Some Western analysts say it is time to call Saddam
Hussein's bluff on the free oil: "We should say, excellent,
send in ships and distribute the free oil to poor countries,"
says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.'s
international unit. "He's the guy who put the prices up in
the first place."
   Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
are now preparing detailed studies of the effect of higher
oil prices on developing countries that they expect to
outline at the time of their annual meetings here beginning
next Thursday. They also are re-examining their programs to
sort out what they can do to ease adjustment, but in general
they don't plan new loan mechanisms.
   A senior U.S. Treasury official recently indicated that
borrowing nations probably will be offered enlarged access to
IMF credits. There will be more-extensive use of the IMF's
so-called compensatory financing, which allows nations to
borrow to insulate themselves against sudden external shocks.
Those hurt by higher oil prices, lower remittances from
citizens who used to work in Iraq and Kuwait, and even the
loss of canal and pipeline fees, should be able to take
advantage of this.
   The World Bank may find ways to accelerate its existing
loan disbursements to developing countries to ease the impact
of the Persian Gulf crisis, Alex Shakow, the agency's
director of external affairs, said Wednesday. But, agency
officials say, such steps will be considered later this month
at a Group of Seven ministerial meeting, and at the World
Bank and IMF annual meetings. The G-7 is made up of the
finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   The Asian tigers -- the fast-growing East Asian economies
of Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong -- are almost
totally dependent on imported oil, and the World Bank's vice
president for Asia, Attila Karaosmanoglu, estimated recently
that they could suffer an added import cost of as much as 1%
of their gross domestic product. But these nations also are
likely to be "the fastest and most pragmatic adjusters," he
said.
   In Eastern Europe, struggling reformers probably would
sustain a reduction of as much as one percentage point in the
growth of gross domestic product because of higher oil
prices, according to studies conducted the past month that
assume a price of $25 a barrel. Higher oil prices also
probably spell a setback for environmental cleanup programs,
as the East Europeans will be more reluctant to give up
burning cheap locally mined brown coal, which is a severe
pollutant.
   For some developing nations the effect of the Kuwait
crisis is indirect through the loss of workers' remittances.
Egypt, for example, stands to benefit from higher oil prices,
but lost worker remittances will more than offset that. There
were one million Egyptians working in Kuwait, Iraq and the
surrounding area. Jordan, Bangladesh and Pakistan also are
particularly badly affected by the loss of remittance income.
Meantime, Turkey loses the profits it garnered from the trade
and transport of goods to Iraq and Kuwait.
