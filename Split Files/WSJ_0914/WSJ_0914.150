   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to liberalize trade with
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and tighten curbs on
shipments of goods that could be used to manufacture missiles
and nuclear and chemical weapons.
   The bill included trade benefits to the Soviets and
Eastern Europeans approved by the Senate Banking Committee
earlier this summer.

   The bill would effectively give the Pentagon the right to
review shipments of certain sensitive goods to certain
nations. The Pentagon doesn't have the authority to screen
exports sent to non-Communist nations.
   The House has passed a reauthorization bill somewhat more
generous to U.S. high-technology exporters than the Senate
version.
   The Senate bill, which would renew the Export
Administration Act for two years, also would empower the U.S.
to impose trade sanctions on nations and companies that
violate international prohibitions on chemical warfare. The
current export law expires Sept. 30.
   A provision by Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.) would
increase penalties for violations of the trade embargo
against Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The civil fine would
be raised to $250,000 from $10,000, and the criminal fine to
$1 million from $50,000.
   The Senate also adopted an amendment by Sen. William Roth
(R., Del.) that would deter the State Department from
arbitrarily adding goods that are no longer controlled on
national-security grounds to its own munitions list.
Exporters have complained that the list is too restrictive.
