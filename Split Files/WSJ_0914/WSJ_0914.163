   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. and the Tokyo Broadcasting System
entered into a joint agreement to share news bureaus,
exchange news footage and perhaps co-produce sports and
entertainment programming.
   Under terms of the agreement, the first between a U.S. and
a Japanese network, CBS News and TBS will share facilities,
camera crews and, occasionally, correspondents, throughout
the world. TBS operates full-time news bureaus in locations
where CBS News doesn't have a presence, including Cairo,
Vienna and Seoul, South Korea.

   The agreement comes as the three major broadcast networks
are struggling to cover world events with severe budget
constraints. The news divisions' budgets are running over
because of rising costs, including those for covering the
crisis in the Middle East. And next year promises little
relief. For instance, the annual budget of NBC News,
estimated at $250 million, is likely to have zero growth next
year, said officials within National Broadcasting Co., a
General Electric Co. unit.
   Co-ventures between U.S. broadcast networks and foreign
news-gathering agencies aren't new. NBC News has a 38%
ownership of Visnews Ltd., and ABC News, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., owns 45% of Worldwide Television News, and
the company says it expects to increase its stake to 80% by
Monday.
   Financial terms of the agreement between CBS and TBS, set
to go into effect in April, weren't disclosed. TBS gets
exclusive rights to all CBS News programming, including the
"Evening News with Dan Rather" and "60 Minutes." Currently,
CBS News and TBS share facilities and camera crews in such
locations as Johannesburg, South Africa, and Tokyo.
   CBS officials said no details had been finalized on sports
or entertainment shows that would be co-produced with TBS.
CBS, the No. 3-rated network in prime time, has been
discussing possible co-productions with the British
Broadcasting Corp., although no joint productions between the
two companies have been announced.
   "The centerpiece of this deal is the news," said James A.
Warner, president of CBS Enterprises. "We could do a
miniseries or movie in entertainment. In sports, it could be
sharing coverage or the bidding for an event."
   TBS created the show on which ABC's top-rated "American's
Funniest Home Videos" is based.
   CBS News has "done nothing" to jeopardize its editorial
independence, said John Frazee, vice president of CBS News
services. In fact, TBS distributed copies of the CBS News
Standards and Practices handbook to its personnel. Mr. Frazee
said CBS "hasn't ruled anything out," including the
possibility of TBS correspondents occasionally appearing on
CBS News broadcasts when TBS covers an event and a CBS News
correspondent isn't available. "They have a number of people
who speak excellent English," he said.
   CBS isn't ruling out additional co-ventures with other
foreign broadcasters, Mr. Frazee said.
