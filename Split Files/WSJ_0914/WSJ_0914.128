   French car manufacturer Renault S.A. said that
class-action lawsuits that had been brought by shareholders
challenging its offer to acquire Mack Trucks Inc. have been
settled.
   The settlement of the suits, which had been consolidated
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, is subject to completion of the offer and final
court approvals.

   The offer is being made by ITM Acquisition Corp., a
subsidiary of Renault. On Sept. 6, Renault said that it had
agreed to acquire all of Mack's common stock not owned
directly or indirectly by it at an offer price of $6.25 a
share.
