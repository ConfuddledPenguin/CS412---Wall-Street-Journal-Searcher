   NEW YORK -- Long-distance telephone companies are helping
U.S. service personnel in the Persian Gulf keep in touch with
families and friends in the U.S. American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. and US Sprint Communications Co. have set up
several free communications services for soldiers in
Operation Desert Shield. MCI Communications Corp. said it
could announce its own service today, probably involving some
charge.
   All three carriers had been contacted by Sen. Alan
Cranston, (D., Calif.,) and the Defense Department last week
about coming up with a plan to improve communications,
including video conferencing and electronic mail, between the
U.S. and the military operation in Saudi Arabia.

   "We're going to offer all these services, but video
conferencing and E-Mail won't be for free," said a Sprint
spokeswoman.
   Sprint is offering a free news service on the Persian Gulf
crisis. A person in the U.S. can dial a special "800" number
to obtain free hourly crisis news updates via facsimile
machine. The news is culled from several news wire services.
The company says it has received 10,000 calls on the line so
far.
