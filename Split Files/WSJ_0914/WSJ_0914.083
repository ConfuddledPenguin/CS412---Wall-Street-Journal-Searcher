   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co., in a major
movie-making partnership between a Hollywood studio and a
Japanese entity, said it formed a $100 million joint venture
with Interscope Communications and Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown,
which is 80%-owned by Tokyo-based Nomura Securities.
   According to the four-year agreement, Disney and Nomura
Babcock &amp; Brown will each make an initial contribution of $50
million to produce and market movies. The pool could be
doubled, or more, by the parties if increased production
requires it.

   Disney likes to share the risks on its movies, and this
arrangement represents a departure from its usual method of
financing motion pictures through Silver Screen partnerships,
which help pay production costs for most Disney films. Disney
is bolstering its film output from about 15 this year to
about 25 next year, and the current Silver Screen partnership
will end in several months.
   "We're looking at new sources of financing," said Walt
Disney Studios Vice President Richard Frank in an interview.
"The success of Silver Screen has encouraged other investors
to approach us with various proposals." Among them, he said,
are other Japanese investors.
   Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown will fund the venture by selling
partnership interests to investors in Japan, mostly large
private corporations, in what will be the largest
film-related syndication in Japan ever, according to Managing
Director Richard Coffey. Japanese investors are known to be
interested in Hollywood, but except for Sony Corp.'s $3.4
billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment last
year, they've approached it delicately: Nomura Babcock &amp;
Brown invested $25 million in independent Morgan Creek
Productions last year, and Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. invested
$100 million in Largo Entertainment, another independent
production company.
   Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown formed a partnership with
Interscope last December to seek a studio partner, and Disney
has a long relationship with Interscope. Interscope has had
an existing contract to submit film projects to Disney first,
and if Disney decides to finance the picture, Interscope
generally will produce the film for a fee. The new joint
venture also will be nonexclusive but give Disney a "first
look." The venture would produce perhaps three films a year,
under either the Touchstone, Hollywood or Disney banners.
   Interscope was founded in 1982 by Ted Field, an heir to
the Marshall Field fortune who came to Hollywood. For Disney,
Interscope's films have included "Three Men and a Baby,"
"Outrageous Fortune" and "Cocktail."
