   United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC, a U.K. food manufacturer,
said pretax profit for the first half ended July 14 rose
9.6%, with gains in the company's key operations offsetting a
decline in earnings at the frozen and chilled food unit, Ross
Youngs.
   United Biscuits' pretax profit of #83 million ($154.4
million), up from #75.7 million in the year-earlier period,
was near the top end of market forecasts, which ranged
between #81 million and #84 million.

11.6 pence from 10.8 pence a year earlier.
   United Biscuits didn't report any extraordinary items in
either period.
   Sales rose 7.8% to #1.38 billion from #1.28 billion.
