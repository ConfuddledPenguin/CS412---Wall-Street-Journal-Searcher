   ARUBA, Dutch Caribbean -- Divi Hotels N.V. said talks
ended with Accor S.A., a French hotel company, for the sale
of all of Divi's assets and properties related to its
Caribbean resort hotel business.
   Divi said Accor withdrew, citing uncertainty about what
impact the Middle East crisis may have on the tourist trade
from North America. The talks were over 11 hotel properties.
