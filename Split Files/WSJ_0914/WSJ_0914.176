   AKRON, Ohio -- Telxon Corp. said it expects earnings for

top $43 million in the quarter ending Sept. 30.
   For the year-earlier period, the maker of portable
computers posted a loss of $3.9 million, or 30 cents a share,

   For the year ending March 31, Telxon said it expects
per-share earnings of 70 cents to 75 cents a share, excluding
the nine-cent-a-share gain from the bond purchase and a
16-cent-a-share gain from a bond purchase earlier this year.
Telxon estimated that revenue will be $170 million to $175
million.
   In fiscal 1990, the company had a loss of $14.4 million,
or $1.09 a share, on revenue of $143.4 million.
   Telxon said it purchased in open market transactions a
total of $8 million face amount of its 7.5% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2012. The purchase represents
about 23% of the outstanding issue, leaving about $28 million
face amount outstanding. Earlier this year, the company
purchased about $10 million of the bonds.
