   Manpower PLC said it agreed to sell five U.K.-based
subsidiaries to Brook Opportunities Ltd. for about $200
million. The employment and financial-services concern said
it also will receive 15% of the voting share capital of
Brook, a company formed to acquire the units.
   Included in the sale would be non-Manpower brand
operations: Brook Street Bureau, Blue Arrow Personnel
Services, Extrastaff, DP Support Services, and IPS Group, all
of which provide employment services. The sale essentially
would complete the disposal of companies that constituted the
Blue Arrow Group before it acquired Manpower Inc. in 1987. On
June 4, Manpower, which is reincorporating in the U.S., sold
a group of six non-Manpower units in the U.S. for $46
million.

   Cash proceeds of the sale would be used to retire Manpower
debt outstanding. The sale must be approved by Manpower
shareholders at a special meeting early next month in London.
