   K mart Corp. said it agreed to acquire a 22% stake in
OfficeMax Inc., an office supply chain that will purchase K
mart's own smaller office supply operation. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The Troy, Mich., retailer said that OfficeMax will run its
five Office Square stores, continuing the company's planned
expansion. OfficeMax, a privately held Cleveland company with
projected sales of $250 million for fiscal 1991, operates 34
stores in seven states. By the end of the current fiscal
year, OfficeMax hopes to have about 65 stores.

   K mart said that, under the agreement, it has the right to
acquire additional equity in OfficeMax within "specified time
frames," which it wouldn't disclose. The deal is subject to
definitive agreements, as well as government approval and the
approval of OfficeMax shareholders and the companies' boards.
