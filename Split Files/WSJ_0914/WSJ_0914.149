   General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about 30,700
1990 model vans and school buses for fuel hose defects that
could cause engine fires.
   GM is "investigating one report of a fire in a van to see
if it's related to this condition," a company spokesman said.
The spokesman said GM isn't aware of any engine fires
involving the school buses or any accidents or injuries
resulting from a faulty fuel hose.

   The recall includes about 29,000 Chevrolet Astro and GMC
Safari vans with 4.3-liter or 2.5-liter engines, and nearly
1,700 Chevrolet and GMC school buses equipped with 366 V-8
gas engines. GM said a faulty hose could leak gasoline, and
that could result in a fire under the hood.
   Detroit-based GM said it is notifying owners about the
recall by mail. Dealers will make repairs at no charge, the
company said.
