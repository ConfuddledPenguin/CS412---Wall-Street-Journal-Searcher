   The Newport Beach, Calif., company said its results are
reflective of "the continued downturn in sales" for
single-family "move-up" housing in most areas of Southern
California. The company builds homes for the "move-up"
market, which is upper-income buyers who have previously
owned a principal residence.
   For the six months, the company had net income of $1.1
million, or eight cents a share, compared with profit of $8.5
million, or 61 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue increased
5.2% to $121.9 million from $115.8 million.
