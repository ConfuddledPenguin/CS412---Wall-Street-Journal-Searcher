   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged a leasing firm official, a pension consultant and
three others with operating an investment scheme that cost
investors, including at least 15 pension funds, more than $26
million.
   The SEC charged that from 1983 through 1987, Governmental
Financial Services, operating under the direction of Charles
Oglebay III of Upper Marlboro, Md., sold $57 million in
unregistered securities to about 800 investors. Investors
were told that their funds would be used to purchase
equipment leases and that they would receive periodic returns
based on income from the leases.

   But by 1984, many of the lessees became delinquent in
their rental payments or defaulted, leading Governmental
Financial and Mr. Oglebay to operate what amounted to a Ponzi
scheme, the SEC said. Mr. Oglebay began using funds from new
investors to pay previous investors, oversold nearly $10
million in leases, and induced investors to waive their
monthly payments by telling them they would be reinvested,
the agency charged.
   The SEC also alleged that Mr. Oglebay and Ralph
McKittrick, president of New York-based McKittrick &amp; Briggs
Securities, misappropriated nearly $2.9 million of investor
funds.
   The agency also charged Glenn Dawson, who was president of
Chesapeake Bay Pension Consultants and owned 25% of
Governmental Financial, with recommending that his clients
invest in the leasing firm "without disclosing any
information about the securities." The agency said at least
15 pension clients invested in various programs connected
with Governmental Financial and that Mr. Dawson didn't
disclose that he received more than $150,000 in commissions
from the company. The SEC didn't identify the pension funds.
   By 1987, Governmental Financial had paid investors about
$31.6 million, even though its equipment leases had produced
revenue of only about $13.3 million, the SEC said. The
remainder of the funds came from other investors, the agency
added. Governmental Financial filed for protection under the
federal Bankruptcy Code in December 1987.
   Messrs. Oglebay, McKittrick and Dawson couldn't be reached
for comment.
   The SEC requested a federal court order directing the
defendants to return all of the money, plus interest,
obtained through the allegedly fraudulent scheme. The SEC
also is seeking permanent injunctions against Messrs.
Oglebay, McKittrick, and others named in the suit.
