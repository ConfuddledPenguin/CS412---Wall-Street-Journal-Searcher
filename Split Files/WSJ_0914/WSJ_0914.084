   In a time of urban turmoil, please note the good sense of
the people of the District of Columbia. In their Democratic
primary for mayor, they have nominated Sharon Pratt Dixon to
run for the office held by Marion Barry. Ms. Dixon, far back
in the pack before election day, had two distinguishing
characteristics: She denounced Mayor Barry and she promised
to fire many D.C. officials. In November she faces the
Republican nominee, former D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner.
We think this outcome confirms our sense of what the Barry
jury's decision to convict on only a minor charge actually
represented. It reflected an awareness that the lessons of
the Marion Barry story had been well absorbed by residents
and that it was time for the District to get on with
rebuilding its politics and its values. In selecting Sharon
Pratt Dixon, District voters signaled that they are eager to
renew their city.
