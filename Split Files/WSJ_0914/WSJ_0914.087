   MCI Communications has put up for review its $50
million-plus account, which has been at Wells, Rich, Greene
since 1987.
   In an interview, Judy Ranzer, MCI's senior vice president
of advertising, said Wells Rich will participate in the
review of the long-distance phone service company's account
along with four other agencies, which she declined to
identify.

   "In the last three years, our advertising needs have grown
enormously," Ms. Ranzer said. "We thought it was time to take
a deep breath and take stock of what was available to us from
agencies' strategic and creative thinking." The review is
expected to be completed by the end of November.
   Despite those comments, Ms. Ranzer praised Wells Rich's
creative work as "truly excellent." People close to the
account said MCI, although routinely enthused with the shop's
"strategic ideas," has been frustrated by what it sees as
Wells Rich's creative inconsistency. New York-based Wells
Rich created MCI's "Let Us Show You" campaign pitching its
long-distance services.
   In addition, industry executives said MCI has been
dismayed by the game of musical chairs among the senior staff
on the account at Wells Rich. Initially, J. Dixon Byrne, an
executive vice president, led the business. But after a year,
he moved to another account, and Charles Evans took the reins
briefly before being dismissed. Paula Kahn, an executive vice
president who previously headed up Wells Rich's Gardner
Advertising unit, also had a brief stint as the account's
leader.
   Another industry executive said the review may have been
called in part because of some shifts in MCI's upper
management.
   The review of the big account comes as MCI has slowly been
increasing its share of the long-distance business. According
to Joel Gross, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, New
York, MCI controls 16% of the U.S. long-distance market,
making it a distant competitor to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which controls 68%. US Sprint controls about 10%
of the market.
   "In this very competitive marketplace, you've got to find
the best weapons that you can get your hands on," Mr. Gross
said. "I think that AT&amp;T has been fairly effective recently
with their `Put It in Writing' campaign to slow down the
attack of the competitors. My guess is that MCI is looking
for something to come back with."
   Mr. Gross and other analysts said the AT&amp;T campaign, which
takes direct shots at its smaller competitors and their
claims of discount prices, has threatened to slow the growth
of MCI's market share. AT&amp;T, of course, has a much bigger
advertising budget than MCI, spending about $550 million last
year.
   MCI, meanwhile, has continued with businesslike ads that
attempt to show the gentlemanly service MCI offers. One
recent campaign, themed "Big-business long distance for your
business," pitched a service called MCI Vision for small and
medium-sized business customers. The ads used a funky camera
technique to make it appear as though a pint-sized
businessmen is growing larger as he walks toward the camera.
"Why is MCI the only company that sees us as we really are?"
an announcer asks in one ad. "Maybe they have a little better
perspective."
   The ads are far different from early MCI spots, including
one that featured comedienne Joan Rivers spouting off about
MCI as a feisty, young company with cheap rates. Analysts
said, though, that MCI has focused on small and medium-sized
businesses because competition has squeezed margins in the
residential and big-business segments.
   It couldn't be determined which agencies would be
considered for the account. But some executives speculated
that Scali, McCabe, Sloves, a unit of WPP Group, and Levine,
Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, two agencies that contended for
the account when it was reviewed in 1987, might be involved.
Another industry executive said Grey Advertising might be on
the short list.
   The loss of the MCI account would be a setback for Wells
Rich, which has made a number of staff changes in its
creative department in a bid to reignite its creative
firepower. Wells Rich's new-business record of late has been
healthy, although it is also under the gun on the giant $60
million Benson &amp; Hedges account from Philip Morris Cos. It is
a finalist for a big new ad assignment from Chase Manhattan
Corp.
   One factor in Wells Rich's favor is a personal connection.
Richard Hopple, the agency's president, has a close
relationship with Ms. Ranzer, the top advertising executive
at MCI. He previously was the senior account man on the MCI
account when it was at D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, another
New York agency.
   Kenneth Olshan, chairman of Wells Rich, said yesterday his
agency will vigorously defend the MCI account. "We've done
great work for MCI and we welcome the challenge to present
ourselves to management," he said.

   GM Cuts Commitments
                                                                                                       

   General Motors is making fewer firm commitments to buy
print and TV advertising next year, Philip Guarascio, GM's
executive director for marketing programs and advertising,
said in a speech yesterday before the Women's Advertising
Club of New York.
   The policy shift means those media deals GM does make
"will be bigger and run longer," Mr. Guarascio noted. For
instance, he said, "we will be reducing our firm magazine
deals by 25% to 30% for 1991." While GM may end up buying the
same number of magazine ad pages by year-end, he added, "not
as many will be locked into a schedule as we have had in the
past."
   He said the auto giant wants greater advertising
flexibility because of the uncertain economic outlook -- even
though GM's overall ad expenditures "look relatively steady"
for 1991. The company spent about $1.29 billion on
advertising in 1988, according to a tally by Advertising Age
magazine.

   BEECH-NUT ACCOUNT: Beech-Nut Nutrition, a unit of Ralston
Purina, awarded the estimated $7 million to $8 million
account for its baby food lines to DDB Needham Chicago, a
unit of Omnicom Group. The account, which had been handled by
Sherwood &amp; Schneider, New York, had been in review following
Ralston's purchase of the Beech-Nut business last November
from Nestle.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Ronnie Cohen has joined Wunderman Worldwide, a
New York-based unit of Young &amp; Rubicam, as executive vice
president, director of client services. She formerly ran
direct marketing operations at Hill, Holliday, Connors
Cosmopulous, Boston.
