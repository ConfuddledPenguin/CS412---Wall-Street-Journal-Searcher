   PHILADELPHIA -- The cash-strapped city of Philadelphia
said it expects credit-rating agencies to further lower its
shaky bond ratings after it failed this week to secure $375
million in short-term loans.
   Elizabeth C. Reveal, Philadelphia's finance director, said
the city would postpone the sale of short-term notes until
state and local politicians acted to boost investor
confidence in the city's long-term fiscal health. During
Wednesday's attempt to price the tax-free notes, some
investors were demanding interest rates of about 9.5% to
compensate for the risk of default.

   "Elected officials . . . have got to begin saying that
they are prepared to do everything in their power so that
Philadelphia does not become insolvent," Ms. Reveal said. She
added that investors and foreign banks were unwilling to lend
Philadelphia money because of continued political wrangling.
   The city's poor credit rating didn't help. Moody's
Investors Service Inc. rates the city's bonds at the below
investment level. Standard and Poor's Corp. gives the city
its lowest investment-grade rating. Both agencies declined to
comment on pending downgrades.
   Swiss Bank Corp.'s withdrawal Wednesday of a guarantee for
$50 million of the notes also made the sale more difficult,
the city said. Swiss Bank cited unspecified unmet conditions
in pulling out.
   But Ms. Reveal maintained that Philadelphia "fully
complied" with all conditions of its contract. "The action
taken by Swiss Bank in withdrawing its commitment is a breach
of its contract with the city," Ms. Reveal said. She added
that the city may take legal action.
   Without an eventual note sale, Ms. Reveal said, the city
will run out of cash in six to 16 weeks, depending on which
accounts it can legally tap. Even with a loan, officials say
the city's $206.4 million budget deficit will cause it to run
out of cash before the fiscal year ends next June 30.
   In an attempt to bring about needed consensus, the Greater
Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce proposed a "financial
summit" of state and local officials to be held next week.
