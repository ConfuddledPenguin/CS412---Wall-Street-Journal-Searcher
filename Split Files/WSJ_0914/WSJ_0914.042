   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. unveiled a
centralized digital printing system, which it said will
improve productivity for personal computer users.
   The new "Lionheart" printer is capable of operating at
speeds to process as many as 92 pages a minute. Kodak said
documents now are printed at the rate of about eight to 10
pages a minute.

workstations to be networked to the printer either directly
or through a print server, Kodak said.
