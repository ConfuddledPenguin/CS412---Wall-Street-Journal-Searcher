   ST. LOUIS -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s Bodine Aluminum said it
will build a $50 million parts plant in Troy, Mo., that
eventually will sell engine parts to the Japan-based auto
maker, with production scheduled to begin in 1993.
   The plant will produce intake manifolds and cylinder heads
that Bodine will sell to Toyota for use in its Georgetown,
Ky., engine plant, said Toyota Motor Corp. Services of North
America Inc., the New York subsidiary that bought Bodine
earlier this year. Though Toyota has the Georgetown engine
plant, it imports many parts from Japan, a Toyota spokesman
in New York said.
