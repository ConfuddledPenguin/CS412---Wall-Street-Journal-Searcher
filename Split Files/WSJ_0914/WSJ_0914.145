   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A federal judge here tentatively held
that victims of last year's Prince William Sound oil spill
must first seek compensation from a special administrative
oil-spill fund before trying to press their claims in court.
   The thought that the massive civil litigation stemming
from the March 1989 wreck of the Exxon Valdez could be put on
hold caught attorneys on both sides of the case off guard and
prompted harsh words from plaintiff attorneys that the ruling
could delay full resolution of the case for years more.

   Judge H. Russel Holland said he considered the proposal a
way of speeding up compensation to victims of the spill. The
Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act fund provides $100
million to oil-spill victims without requiring them to prove
any wrongdoing. The fund, which recently was amended by
Congress in a partial attempt to speed compensation to
victims, is financed through levies on owners of crude
passing through the Alaskan pipeline.
   "If those who have suffered monetary losses are allowed to
proceed in state or federal court with classic common law
litigation without first exhausting the fund's administrative
payment procedures, the congressional purpose of
expeditiously providing adequate compensation to all those
injured . . . would be thwarted," the judge reasoned.
   But plaintiff attorneys argued that actual damages dwarf
the amount contained in the fund and that stalling inevitable
court proceedings to recover the difference would only delay
just compensation to victims. They said haggling over
pro-rata shares to victims, as the fund requires if damages
are found to exceed the $100 million fund limit, could take
years.
   "If there is going to be litigation, why stay it now and
then rev it up again when the claims are becoming stale and
memories are fading?" asked Lloyd B. Miller, an Anchorage
attorney, representing a number of native Alaskan groups
affected by the spill.
