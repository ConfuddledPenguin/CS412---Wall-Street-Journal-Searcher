   The Golden Years?

   Life begins at forty,
   So does faulty eyesight,
   Twinges of lumbago,
   Diets to stay light,
   Napping after supper,
   A yen for warmer climes,
   And telling the same joke
   Two or three times.
   -- Gail Cooke.

   Seminar Problem
                                                                                                       

   Pie charts have the wrong effect,
   Evoke my gourmet dream;
   I think of cherry, pecan crunch,
   Also banana cream.

   Business Note
                                                                                                       

   It's not whether you win or lose, but where you place the
blame.
   -- Sam Ewing.
