   HONG KONG -- The launch of the Korea Asia Fund, a $100
million mutual fund investing solely in South Korean
equities, was postponed because of uncertain market
conditions and weak investor interest.
   "We'll watch the market day by day," said a spokesman for
Salomon Brothers International Ltd., one of the four lead
managers. "The launch date is still uncertain." The other
lead managers are Yamaichi International (HK) Ltd., Dongsuh
Securities Co. and Coryo Securities Corp.

   The fund, the third foreign-managed stock mutual fund
investing solely in Korea, was scheduled to reach the market
yesterday. But prospects soured in the poor market
environment that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Analysts
also noted that a flood of stock issues in Korea during the
past six months has saturated the market.
   Korea's Finance Ministry, which was eager for the new
issue, is likely to insist that the launch take place fairly
soon. Besides delaying a desired infusion of capital, the
postponement threw a shadow over other expected issues. Two
Korean companies, Kolon Industries Ltd. and Jindo Corp., were
planning to float convertible bonds soon but now are expected
to wait until the Korea Asia Fund gets off the ground.
