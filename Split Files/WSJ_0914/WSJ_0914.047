   TOKYO -- The number of Japanese corporate bankruptcies,
maintaining a downward trend, dropped 8.6% to 513 in August
from a year earlier, a private credit agency said.
   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. noted, however, that the number of
business failures resulting from labor shortages came to a
record 35 in the month.

   "Because of continued favorable economic conditions and
changes in the country's industrial structure now under way,
labor shortages are becoming more serious regardless of area
or industry," it said. "As a result, the number of companies
finding themselves in trouble has been increasing sharply."
   Japan's economy has been expanding for 46 months in a row
because of robust domestic demand such as corporate equipment
investment and personal spending. In the process of
expansion, however, it has created serious manpower shortages
in the country.
   Agency officials said bankruptcies related to labor
shortages have totaled 157 so far this year, already
considerably more than the 128 recorded for the entire year
of 1989. The August total was larger, though only by one
case, than the previous monthly record of 34 set in July.
