   SHELL CANADA Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, oil and gas
concern, said it plans to offer 150 million Canadian dollars
(US$128.9 million) of 11.625% Eurobonds, due Oct. 11, 1995.
The unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern,
said proceeds from the bonds, which will be priced at 101.60
and denominated in units of C$1,000 and C$10,000, will be
used for general purposes. Shell Canada said Toronto-based
Wood Gundy Inc. will lead the issue's underwriting group.
