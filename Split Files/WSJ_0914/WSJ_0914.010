   ERIE, Pa. -- Zurn Industries Inc. said it reached a
tentative agreement to end a two-week work stoppage at its
plant here that produces steam generating equipment and
employs 550 workers.
   However, a spokesman at the company declined to provide
details of the tentative pact.

   The company said workers, who are members of local 3199 of
the U.S. Steel Workers of America, will vote this weekend on
the proposal, which includes increases in wages and benefits.
   The spokesman declined to say whether Zurn had been hurt
by the work stoppage that involved between 300 and 400
workers.
   Zurn designs and makes systems for generating energy from
waste products.
