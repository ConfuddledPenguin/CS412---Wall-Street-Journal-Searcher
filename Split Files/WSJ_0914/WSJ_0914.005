   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of Japanese
business conditions shows a robust economy but analysts say
the rise in interest rates and the drop in the stock market
will eventually brake growth.
   Opinions are divided, however, about whether another
increase in the official discount rate will be needed before
that slowdown begins. The discount rate is the fee the
central bank charges on bank loans.

   The survey, known as the tankan, was conducted in August
and took into account the rise in oil prices after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in early August. The survey's results were
released Tuesday.
   Despite the jump in oil prices and August's drop in the
stock market and rise in interest rates, "the more I look at
the {tankan} the more I'm impressed with how robust the
economy is," said Patricia Kuwayama, vice president of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co. of New York's economics department.
   She said the outlook for most industries is the same or
even improved since the previous survey as consumers and
businesses continue to spend, fueling a domestic demand-led
expansion that is spread evenly across the whole economy and
regions of the country.
   Other economic data this week support the bullish outlook
of the survey. The Economic Planning Agency announced that
machinery orders in July were up 24% from a year earlier and
the Bank of Japan reported that the steady growth of personal
consumer spending is expected to continue through this fiscal
year, which ends March 31.
   However, analysts believe rising interest rates and the
slumping stock market will eventually slow the economy,
especially capital spending.
   "It will take some time for the effect of the higher
interest rates to appear" but the effect will show up, said
Kazuko Mizuno, economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   Since May 1989, the BOJ has raised its discount rate five
times from its historic low of 2.5%. It was last increased by
3/4 percentage point, to 6%, at the end of August.
   With the supply of products tight, the labor shortage
worsening and service costs rising, the timing of the rate
boost was just right, said Kunio Miyamoto, director and chief
economist of the Sumitomo Life Research Institute, an
affiliate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.
   Whether another rate increase will be needed depends on
the situation in the Middle East and oil prices, he added.
