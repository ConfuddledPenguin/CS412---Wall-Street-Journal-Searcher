   NEW YORK -- The dollar was hurt by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks, which hinted at a quick
move to cut interest rates upon the completion of a federal
budget-reduction accord.
   The greenback dropped an entire German pfennig in the
half-hour following the remarks in the late New York morning,
and was quoted late in the day at 1.5677 marks, well below
1.5913 marks late Wednesday. Against the Japanese currency,
the dollar dropped to 136.20 yen, down from 138.09 yen in New
York late Wednesday. That level was its worst since Aug. 1 of
last year, when the dollar ended at 135.90 yen.

   Sterling was trading at $1.8825, up from $1.8594 late
Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
136.50 yen, down from 137.65 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5680
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5911 marks.
   The central banker's comments were hardly new, since they
only repeated a promise made in June to administration
officials and lawmakers eager for the cheaper money they
believe is necessary to stave off a U.S. recession.
   But the remarks caught many foreign-exchange traders off
guard, slipped as they were into a question-and-answer
session that followed House testimony on deposit insurance.
   The dollar had been mixed throughout Asian and early
European trading, and U.S. traders had entered their session
adding to long, or overbought, dollar positions, especially
against the mark.
   "You get into these situations when everyone is trading
technically," said David Gilmore, a currency analyst with
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei. "Greenspan caught people right
in the middle of building long positions, and they had to get
out of them quickly. It's not what he said that was so
startling, but it came at an inopportune time."
   Keith Raphael, a Chase Manhattan vice president, agreed
that long-dollar positions, especially against the mark, had
set up the greenback for a fall yesterday morning.
   In addition, Mr. Raphael said, the market was "unnerved"
by Mr. Greenspan's earlier comments about U.S. banks.
   "There remain all too many problems in the banking system,
problems that have been growing of late as many banks,
including many larger banks, have been experiencing a
deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios,
particularly real estate loans," the Fed chairman said.
   The General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget
Office had issued similar warnings this week. "It's nothing
we didn't know," Mr. Raphael said, "but when Greenspan says
it, he gives it weight."
   The central banker went on to express the opinion that the
market would lower long-term interest rates if it perceived a
federal budget agreement to be credible, enforceable and
long-lasting. Should that happen, Mr. Greenspan said he
"would assume" that the Fed would be "moving toward ease" in
its credit policy.
   At his daily press briefing yesterday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration is "still
optimistic" for a budget pact in the next few days.
   Also helping to push the dollar lower against the yen was
selling of the mark against the Japanese currency after
support broke at 87.20 yen. The German currency later
rebounded and was quoted in late New York trading at 86.879
yen, up from 86.778 yen Wednesday.
   The dollar is often used as an intermediary in such
"cross-rate" transactions. For instance, a trader seeking to
buy yen and sell marks might initially sell marks for dollars
and then sell the dollars for yen. Such trades tend to boost
the U.S. currency against its German counterpart while
weakening the dollar against Japan's currency.
   The greenback ended European dealings yesterday broadly
weaker. The currency hadn't moved much through the bulk of
European dealings, until Mr. Greenspan's comments caused it
to skid in the final hour of trading.
   The dollar finished volatile Asian dealings mixed. It
dropped against the yen but finished well above its low for
the session. The currency was last quoted in Tokyo Thursday
at 137.65 yen, down from 138.30 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar began Tokyo trading down sharply against the
Japanese currency, at 137.40 yen compared with 138.10 yen
several hours earlier in New York. Yen bulls predicted the
dollar would drop below 137 yen before the end of the day.
   But rounds of profit-taking beginning at mid-morning
revived the dollar, as participants locked in gains on long
yen positions.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $382.90 an ounce, up 80 cents. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $383.95 an ounce.
