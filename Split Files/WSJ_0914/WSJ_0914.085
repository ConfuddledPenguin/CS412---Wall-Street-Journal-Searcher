   TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal cut its prime lending rate a
quarter of a percentage point to 13.75%, its lowest level
since January.
   John Parish, the bank's assistant chief economist, said
the rate reduction was prompted by a recent decline in
short-term Canadian interest rates and by the country's
economic slowdown. The prime rate is the base rate charged on
loans to businesses and individuals.

   It was the second time in two weeks that Bank of Montreal
cut its prime rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Other
major Canadian banks have kept their prime rates at 14.25%.
   The Bank of Montreal action followed a decline in the Bank
of Canada bank rate yesterday to 12.7% from 12.82%. The bank
rate is the levy by the central bank on loans to financial
institutions. The bank rate, which has declined for 12
consecutive weeks, is set weekly at a quarter of a percentage
point above the average yield on three-month Canadian
government treasury bills at the Thursday bill auction.
