   NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. conducted 24.2% of
all program trading during the week of Aug. 20 to 24, the New
York Stock Exchange said.
   Morgan Stanley traded 23.4 million shares in program
trading strategies for the period, 6.9 million of which
involved stock-index arbitrage. The firm traded only 2.5
million shares for its own account with the rest involving
customer orders. Some 96.7 million shares traded in program
trading strategies during the period, according to the
exchange.

   In stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial form of
program trading, traders dart between stocks, futures and
options to profit from fleeting price discrepancies.
   Overall, program trading accounted for 10.2% of the Big
Board's average daily volume of 189.9 million shares for the
period, down from 13.9% of average daily volume of 148
million the previous week.
   Of the average 19.3 million shares of program volume
executed daily during that week, buy programs accounted for
an average 6.9 million shares daily and sell programs
accounted for an average 12.4 million shares daily, the
exchange said.
   Behind Morgan, Susquehanna Investment Group traded 16.1
million shares in program trading strategies, and Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co., a unit of General Electric Co., traded 9.8
million shares. Most of Kidder's activity involved
stock-index arbitrage.
