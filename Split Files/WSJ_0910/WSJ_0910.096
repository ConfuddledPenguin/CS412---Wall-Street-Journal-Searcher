   Paisley, Ore. -- You know the folks here aren't kidding
about this being the Mosquito Capital of the World when you
check into the local bed &amp; breakfast and your hostess, her
arms scarred from bites gone bad, hands you a can of insect
repellent.
   Any other place, they'd put a mint on your pillow. In
Paisley, a dinky town in southeastern Oregon, an offer to
spray you is a show of hospitality.

   Paisley rolled out the red carpet recently for several
thousand people who (1) managed to find the town on the map;
and (2) stayed long enough to learn what a mosquito festival
is.
   A mosquito festival is . . . well, it's something that
would put Tom Sawyer to shame. You may recall that clever Tom
got out of painting the fence himself. Now that was just one
day. The people of Paisley have been carrying out their ruse
for seven years.
   Since 1984, at the height of what is recognized as the
worst mosquito infestation in Oregon, the Paisleyites (all
345 of them) have proclaimed their annual Mosquito Festival.
   Each year more suckers, er, visitors, pour into town on a
hot summer weekend to attend the coronation of Ms. Quito,
watch the Mosquito Festival parade, buy souvenir T-shirts and
spend money at events such as the horseshoe tournament,
tomahawk-throwing contest and chicken-poop lotto.
   After the out-of-towners leave Paisley, with their wallets
considerably lighter, the denizens count their take and put
in a big order for mosquito spray. Then, for the rest of the
year, they live in relative comfort, free of the legendary
clouds of mosquitoes that some folks remember from
pre-festival days.
   Why, it used to be so bad that Bob Rutledge's horses lost
about 200 pounds a year, just trying to run away from the
mosquitoes. Thanks to the Mosquito Festival, he said, the
horses now lose only 20 pounds.
   "You could ride a white horse out into the marsh and
pretty soon it would be brown and then {shudder} red," he
said.
   Pre-festival mosquitoes "reduced visibility," according to
Beverly Hills, the 1984 Ms. Quito. And Pam Forga, the 1987
Ms. Quito, said nobody went out at night, but if they had to,
they covered as much skin as they could and didn't open their
mouths, for fear of swallowing mosquitoes.
   To add insult to injury for Paisley teenagers, the place
one was most likely to be bitten was Lovers' Lane, a gravel
road that extends into the soggy marshlands that surround the
town. Never daring to bare their flesh or open their mouths,
young lovers could sit in their cars and watch cattle in
neighboring fields being stampeded by swarms of mosquitoes.
   Until they hatched the idea of a Mosquito Festival, the
Paisleyites tried many solutions. Aerial sprays just blew
away, and electric bug zappers, which they attached to nearly
every telephone pole in town, kept folks awake with constant
bug electrocutions. Besides that, mosquitoes weren't
attracted to the zappers' light.
   About a zillion other bugs were, and their zapped corpses
created huge mounds on the sidewalk at the base of every
telephone pole. The dead bugs attracted a nightly parade of
skunks, but darned if the people of Paisley were going to
throw a Skunk Festival, too.
   But this Mosquito Festival notion has been working just
fine. The first festival raised enough money to buy a mobile
sprayer, and enough spray to douse the town a couple of
times. Relief was in sight.
   The festival proceeds get a little higher each year, so
that these days the town can afford to spray once or twice a
week during the summer. This year's take, for example, was
well over $20,000.
   Mosquitoes beware.
   Regular spraying plus unusually dry weather kept the
mosquitoes at bay during the 1990 Mosquito Festival. But just
in case, Paisley Mercantile had stocked up on "skeeter dope,"
and the folks who rode in the parade (mostly people dressed
up as mosquitoes) threw insect swatters to the crowd.
   Before the parade began, the 1990 Ms. Quito was crowned in
the shadow of the town's giant mosquito statue. JoAnn Solheim
was all aquiver at the honor, but one got the impression
that, sooner or later, every female in Paisley would become
Ms. Quito.
   The 1989 Ms. Quito, Cindy Vickerman, admitted that bearing
the title for an entire year had not boosted her prestige.
"People laugh at me," she said. As for her official duties:
"Shoot, I can't think of anything."
   According to mosquito experts, there are at least 15
varieties of mosquitoes breeding in the marshlands around
Paisley. Cattle ranchers flood-irrigate their hay fields
every summer, and the mosquitoes move right in.
   The Paisleyites have been told that the only comparable
mosquito population in the U.S. is in Alaska, but the
occasional Alaskan visitor to Paisley is said to leave in a
hurry, eager to get home to where the mosquitoes just nibble,
and don't take a pound (or two, or 200) of flesh.
   Thanks to the Mosquito Festival, clouds of ravenous
insects swarming through town are becoming a distant memory.
They'll stay that way, too, as long as people are just
itching to come to Paisley every year to help celebrate a
scourge.
