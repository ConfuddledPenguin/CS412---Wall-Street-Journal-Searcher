   LONDON -- Uranium prices are up this year, but not because
of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and talk of possible oil
shortages this winter. Indeed, industry experts say a supply
glut will prevent renewed concern about alternative energy
sources from quickly resuscitating the depressed uranium
market.
   While spot uranium prices, quoted by Nuexco, a nuclear
fuel broker, now are smartly higher than their February lows
of $8.70 a pound, they failed to follow oil's surge last
month. In fact, they dipped 25 cents to $11.45 a pound in
August.

   "There's more than sufficient supplies of uranium to
satisfy demand and it takes long lead times to propose and
build new nuclear power plants," says Earl Hoellen, president
and chief operating officer of Nuexco.
   Spot uranium prices soared to a peak of $43.70 in 1978
from $6 in 1973, mainly because of the two previous oil-price
shocks. Yet jaded delegates at a conference last week
organized by the London-based Uranium Institute don't expect
a repeat performance this time.
   Uranium needs of nuclear reactors will rise marginally to
47,500 metric tons in 1995 from 45,700 metric tons in 1990,
estimates the institute, which represents producers and
consumers. Meanwhile, actual and potential supplies from
Western producers, the Soviet Union, China and reprocessing
plants will rise to 60,606 metric tons in 1995 from 46,848
tons this year, the institute forecasts.
   Over and above this projected imbalance of production over
demand are inventories of around 182,000 metric tons, the
institute says. These stocks are likely to grow, conference
delegates said last week, because of the U.S.-Soviet Union
agreement to reduce nuclear arsenals.
   Nevertheless, nuclear power will be used more widely as a
result of the Gulf crisis and worries about the "greenhouse
effect," contends Kunihiko Uematsu, director general of the
Organization For Economic Co-Operation and Development's
Nuclear Energy Agency.
   Primary energy use will rise by more than 60% world-wide
between 1985 and 2020, he predicts. A surge in demand is
already taking place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
Mr. Uematsu says, and consumption will grow in developed, Far
Eastern, South American and Third World nations, he says.
Currently, only 5% of the world's total primary energy is
generated by nuclear power, he says.
   Provided plants are vigilant about safety, nuclear power
has clear environmental advantages, Mr. Uematsu says. Nuclear
plants in operation and under construction will produce
400,000 megawatts of electricity, he says. An equivalent
amount generated by fossil fuels would release an
unacceptable two billion tons of carbon dioxide.
   The Chernobyl disaster made the public wary of nuclear
power however, Mr. Uematsu says. As a result, highly trained
workers are leaving "a declining industry," while fewer
students are taking courses in nuclear engineering.
   Some brokers blame the uranium glut on a market that isn't
truly free. The vast majority of utilities, particularly in
Europe and the Far East, buy uranium from producers at prices
well above the spot market price, says Heera Clark, vice
president marketing and consulting, Uranium Exchange Co.
   Utilities purchase uranium at $20 to $30 a pound to ensure
security of supplies, she says, an unnecessary premium given
the surfeit of potential supplies. If users bought more
uranium on the open market, producers would be encouraged to
lower output, she says, and the market would become more
balanced.
   U.S. utilities, however, buy more uranium on the spot
market than other international players, Ms. Clark says. They
are forced to do so because rate payers keep a close watch on
costs.
   "Spot market transactions only account for about a seventh
of annual uranium supplies," says Treva Klingbiel,
director-market analysis at Nuexco. "Yet, there are signs
that more U.S. and international utilities are taking
advantage of low prices."
   Spot and near-term transactions rose 33% to 33 million
pounds (15,000 metric tons) last year and this year have
reached 30 million pounds (13,600 tons) by the end of August,
she says.
   Nevertheless, uranium exploration spending tumbled to $128
million in 1989 from $738 million in 1989, because of low
prices, says Douglas Underhill, Manager Geotechnical
Consulting, Nuclear Assurance Corporation. Unless mines
expand in the 1990s, he says, production will fall below
consumption and prices will surge.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices boomed Friday and could continue strong.
Traders are growing increasingly concerned over production
problems in foreign countries that could reduce supplies.
   The most-actively traded December contract on New York's
Commodity Exchange rose to a new life-of-contract high of
$1.3050 a pound before ending just slightly under that level,
at $1.3035, a gain of 6.95 cents.
   Chile recently suffered its third cave-in in a principal
mine, and other producing countries such as Peru and Zambia
also have troubles, analysts said.
   Demand for futures contracts in New York was also
triggered by strength in London, where Far Eastern buying of
futures touched off buying by traders who previously sold
short contracts in anticipation of continued price declines,
analysts said.
                                                                                                       

   Coffee
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices plunged Friday on profit-taking and other
selling, but analysts said concern over obtaining immediately
available supplies of green coffee remained a strong
potential price-supporting factor.
   The December contract ended with a loss of four cents a
pound at 98.25 cents after trading early in the session as
high as $1.0260.
   "The price drop should be only a transitory development if
the prospect that supplies of coffee over the near-term are
going to be tight," said one analyst. "Also, a price decline
of this kind may cause roasters, who are now entering their
peak processing season, to come in and buy needed supplies."
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   The latest government corn and soybean crop estimates to
be released Wednesday will be a dominant factor influencing
futures prices this week. Private sector estimates released
late last week of the corn crop as of Sept. 1 predicted a
slightly higher figure than the Agriculture Department Aug. 1
estimate of 7.85 billion bushels of corn. If those estimates
are borne out by the government figures on Wedneseday, corn
futures prices could come under selling pressure.
   Private soybean estimates straddle the government's Aug. 1
figure of 1.836 billion bushels. Traders said it was unlikely
that speculators would be amassing any sizable trading
positions in either crop ahead of release of the government
estimates after the close of trading Wednesday.
   Hot and dry weather forecasted for most growing regions
this week may threaten harvest yields and lends support to
futures prices. But analysts said that a slight increase in
the chance that it may rain in Mississippi River delta
growing areas this week, may rein in any weather-related
futures price advances.
