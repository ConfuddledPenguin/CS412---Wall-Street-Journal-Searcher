   BURLINGTON, Mass. -- John Borowski, owner of a small
defense contractor here, never seemed to worry much about how
to dispose of the toxic wastes his plant produced. He had
developed a simple, cheap method.
   Using buckets, his workers would scoop fuming nitric acid
and nickel wastes out of vats and pour them down a sink. When
workers questioned the practice, Mr. Borowski told them not
to worry because it wouldn't hurt anyone, former employees
say. He knew the dumping was illegal but considered it "like
not counting tips for income tax," says Peter Kruczynski, a
former manager at Mr. Borowski's Borjohn Optical Technology
Inc.

   The federal government saw it differently. In May, Mr.
Borowski became the first person convicted on charges of
knowing endangerment under the federal Clean Water Act.
Scheduled for sentencing in October, he could be sent to
prison for years.
   Thousands of gallons of wastes went down Mr. Borowski's
sink over the past decade, from there finding their way into
Boston Harbor. Some of the workers in his bucket brigade
developed rashes and other ailments, but Mr. Borowski
attributed the problems to drinking or laziness, former
employees testified at his trial. "If I had to follow every
rule on the books, I'd be out of business," one worker
testified Mr. Borowski told him.
   Mr. Borowski won't discuss the case, except to say that he
was unfairly charged because of "a clique of people who
really tried to do severe harm to me and to the company." He
plans an appeal.
   A decade ago, the government might well have treated the
dumping like minor tax cheating, at most slapping Borjohn
Optical with a fine. But Uncle Sam is no longer playing Mr.
Nice Guy with environmental cheaters. "A person who mugs a
city by polluting should receive at least as strong a
punishment as the person who mugs an individual," declares
James M. Strock, the Environmental Protection Agency's
criminal enforcement chief.
   Judges and juries are beginning to agree. In fiscal 1989,
federal courts handed out prison terms totaling about 37
years and $11.1 million in fines for environmental crimes,
compared with less than two years of sentences and $198,000
in fines five years earlier, EPA figures show.
   Prosecutors are aiming higher up the corporate ladder,
too. In May, Paul Tudor Jones II, president of Tudor
Investment Corp. and a prominent futures trader, pleaded
guilty to criminally violating the Clean Water Act by filling
in wetlands to build a corporate retreat. He agreed to pay $2
million in fines and restitution and drew 18 months'
probation.
   Greater enforcement efforts evidently are in store. Last
month the Senate passed a bill that would more than triple
the number of federal investigators going after polluters, to
at least 200 by 1996. And Massachusetts has formed a
30-person Environmental Crimes Strike Force.
   This push began in the early 1980s, about the time the
evacuations of Love Canal in Niagara, N.Y., and of
dioxin-laden Times Beach, Mo., brought home the dangers of
toxic waste. "On the one hand, the EPA was friendly to
business during the Reagan years," says Russell Mokhiber,
editor of the Corporate Crime Reporter, a newsletter in
Washington, D.C. "But along with Republicans' deregulation
came a law-and-order philosophy; the Justice Department had
some cops who were out there enforcing the law."
   If convicted, environmental-crime defendants are more
likely to draw prison time now because of felony clauses
added in the '80s, and also because of federal sentencing
guidelines set in 1987. Before the new guidelines, jail terms
were rare, and typically totaled 60 to 90 days. Now, "an
individual convicted of an environmental felony will likely
have to serve approximately two years in prison," Kevin A.
Gaynor, a Washington lawyer, recently wrote in the journal
Environmental Forum.
   Not surprisingly, that's causing heated debate.
"Environmental criminal enforcement is on the verge of
spinning out of control" because of "increasingly complex
regulations" and arbitrary prosecutions, charges Mr. Gaynor,
who defends companies and executives in such cases and
represented Mr. Jones in the wetlands case. "Now virtually
any environmental violation is potentially a criminal case."
   The EPA's Mr. Strock sees it differently. "The clearest
evidence we have that stronger enforcement is deterring crime
is the increased anxiety expressed lately by the regulated
community," he says.
   Law-enforcement officers acknowledge that the milder
policies of the past may have lulled business people into
complacency. Consider Robert and Scott McKiel, a father and
son who ran Astro Circuit Corp., a Lowell, Mass., concern
that went bankrupt two years ago.
   As president of an electronics company with about 300
employees, the elder Mr. McKiel seemed above reproach. He was
a member of Lowell's Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club, and
served as an officer in his industry's trade group. His son,
Scott, vice president of operations, seemed cut from the same
cloth.
   Beginning in 1986, city officials repeatedly notified
Astro Circuit that illegally high concentrations of toxic
metals were detected in its waste water. But the McKiels paid
little attention to the notices, and the younger one
responded "nonchalantly" when investigators confronted him
with evidence of the violations, say federal attorneys.
"We're guilty," the attorneys quoted him as saying. "What are
you going to do, put us in jail or something?"
   Last year, he was sentenced to three months in prison and
two years on probation after pleading guilty to knowingly
violating federal water laws. His father, who pleaded guilty
to similar violations, got four months in prison and two
years' probation. The McKiels didn't return phone calls
seeking comment.
   The typical scenario for toxic turpitude is a
cash-strapped firm deciding that plugging the flow of
pollutants is just too expensive. Properly disposing of a
single 55-gallon barrel of toxic waste now costs as much as
$1,000. For small companies, such costs can quickly become a
make-or-break expense when business is weak.
   Some regulators fear an environmental crime wave will hit
if the economy worsens. And the new polluters might be better
at covering their tracks. "Midnight dumping is essentially a
thing of the past," says Andrew Savitz, Massachusetts
assistant secretary for environmental law enforcement. "Now
we're dealing with technical environmental crimes . . .
committed behind closed doors."
   Consider Wells Metal Finishing Inc., a now-defunct company
in Lowell, Mass., near the Merrimack River, a waterway
federal officials have targeted for cleanup. After municipal
water officials warned owner and president John Wells about
illegal discharges into the river, he installed some special
plumbing. It shunted waste solutions laden with cyanide and
zinc past his concern's water-treatment system into the
sewer, and eventually into the Merrimack -- which is used for
drinking -- water downstream from the plant. That enabled his
company to freely dispose of large amounts of toxic chemicals
that otherwise would have overloaded his treatment system,
potentially tipping off employees or regulators to illegal
discharges.
   But sensors outside the company's property showed its
cyanide "was turning Lowell's sewer into a gas chamber," says
Brendan O'Brien, an EPA investigator. Finally, a visiting
city inspector noticed the illegal bypass. Mr. Wells denied
the extra pipe's purpose and promptly ordered the inspector
out of his building, according to U.S. attorneys. It was too
late. Now he is serving a 15-month prison term.
   To counter such tricks, government agencies have assembled
teams of scientists, lawyers and detectives outfitted with
gear ranging from electronic sniffers to "moon suits" for
poking around in sewers. But environmental violators remain
hard to catch and convict. In a case in Gloucester, Mass.,
officials discovered a polluter's practices only after the
chemicals involved blew up in the sewer, sending manhole
covers flying and forcing a downtown evacuation. Most
environmental crimes escape notice until someone, often a
disgruntled employee, tips off investigators.
   That's what happened in Mr. Borowski's case. From the
outside, his Borjohn Optical seemed to be doing everything
right. Its mirror-making business, which involved plating
nickel onto aluminum pieces and then treating them with acid,
boomed after it won contracts to make optical parts for M-1
tanks, cruise missiles and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. But
some of the winning bids seemed low, says a competitor, who
asked not to be named: "We wondered how they were keeping
costs down."
   Part of the answer lay in Mr. Borowski's hard work. The
70-year-old Polish immigrant, though plagued by back injuries
reportedly inflicted by the Nazis in World War II, has an
iron constitution and an intense drive to succeed. Working
long hours, he personally oversaw every detail of Borjohn's
operations, even coming in late at night to recharge
nickel-plating solutions.
   He demanded the same dedication from workers. When he
first dumped acid, says former employee Jerzy Kocjan, "I
looked down and saw holes all over my pants {from splattered
drops}. `Jesus, what's happening?' I thought. Then I saw my
hands were turning yellow from the acid vapors. When I showed
them to Borowski, he just showed me his hands. They were
yellow, too."
   Indeed, Mr. Borowski never seemed to realize how toxic
Borjohn's chemicals were, agree former employees. Once he put
his daughter's old bicycle in a vat of the company's acid
overnight to clean it up, they said. The bike partly
dissolved and fell apart. Mr. Borowski once even temporarily
stored an open vat of acid outside his building, only a few
feet from an apartment parking lot where children played, say
former employees.
   Why didn't the workers complain to the authorities?
   Mr. Borowski hired recent Polish immigrants to work in his
plating room. Few knew much English, and some were illegal
aliens. They were eager for work and reluctant to buck
Borjohn's down-the-sink system. Some quit after getting sick.
But repression in Poland kept new ones coming, and Borjohn
became "a revolving door" for such people, says Cerise
Lim-Epstein, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Borowski took steps to avert regulators'
suspicions by occasionally hiring toxic-waste concerns to
legally dispose of the hazardous wastes, prosecutors alleged.
That provided documentation he presented as evidence that
Borjohn was doing the right thing. Records later obtained by
the government showed Borjohn properly disposed of 110
gallons of the toxic solutions between 1986 and 1988.
Meanwhile, it had used about 11,000 gallons of the stuff in
that period, according to evidence presented at the trial.
   Things began to unravel in 1987 when Mr. Borowski hired
Mr. Kruczynski, a young Polish immigrant, to help manage his
growing business. What made Mr. Kruczynski, now 28, a good
management candidate -- his sharp mind, pluck and fluent
English -- made him just the wrong man to oversee illegal
dumping.
   While learning the ropes at Borjohn, "I called its
chemical supplier and asked if it was right to throw the
chemicals down the sink," Mr. Kruczynski says. "When they
said no, I confronted Borowski and told him we had to stop
the dumping. He gave me a father-to-son talk about how people
do it all the time. `Who does it really hurt?' he said."
   Mr. Kruczynski soon found out. He noticed that workers in
the plating room invariably got rashes. One "came in looking
like he had been rolling in poison ivy," he recalls. Another
keeled over after taking "too big a whiff" of one of
Borjohn's chemicals. "I took him to the hospital," says Mr.
Kruczynski. "He recovered but felt bad for days."
   That employee, Jan Bafia, was later examined by a doctor,
whose report was presented in court. Among other things, Mr.
Bafia, who declines to be interviewed, reportedly suffered
from bleeding gums and eroding teeth, a painful cough,
blisters on his face and arms, and hair loss. At least twice,
he coughed up blood. Now he is probably at increased risk for
cancer from Borjohn's chemicals, according to the doctor's
report included in the evidence at Mr. Borowski's trial.
   Acting on a tip, federal agents barged into Borjohn in
1988, seizing evidence that led to Mr. Borowski being
indicted for knowing endangerment under the Clean Water Act.
After a four-week trial, a federal jury convicted him of two
knowing-endangerment counts, each of which carries a maximum
15-year prison term and $250,000 fine.
   Awaiting sentencing, Mr. Borowski now runs his company
under close EPA scrutiny. His lawyer, William Codinha, argues
that the government improperly prosecuted the case under
environmental law, which traditionally applies to "what
happens under the street or in the sewer and not in the
sink." Prosecutors offered only circumstantial evidence that
Borjohn's sewer discharges contained illegally high
concentrations of toxic chemicals, he maintains.
   Furthermore, says the lawyer, before 1987 it was only a
misdemeanor to break the federal law under which Mr. Borowski
was convicted. Now it's a felony. He adds that the confusion
due to this "midstream" change has been compounded lately by
prosecutors' crackdown on environmental crime.
   "We're really dealing with a changing, fluid system here,"
he says.
