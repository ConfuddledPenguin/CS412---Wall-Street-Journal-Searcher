   TOKYO -- When stocks crash, derivatives burn.
   The collapse of Tokyo stock prices has devastated the
market for Japanese equity warrants, crippling what had been
one of the most lucrative and popular sectors of the
London-based Eurobond market.

   Many Japanese companies sold equity-warrant bonds as an
inexpensive way of raising money during the Tokyo stock
market's heyday. Companies could issue bonds that paid
interest of only a fraction of 1%, by attaching equity
warrants as an inducement. More than $70 billion of Japanese
equity warrants have been issued in the past three years.
   A warrant gives an investor the right, but not the
obligation, to buy the issuing company's stock at a set price
during a specified period. As long as the price of the
underlying stock is rising, the purchaser can make a profit
by exercising the warrant.
   But since the start of the year, Japanese stocks, as
measured by the 225-share Nikkei average, have lost more than
38% of their value -- the market's steepest loss in a single
year since World War II. While there isn't any formal index
measuring performance of the warrant market -- most
transactions take place in London, outside the purview of
Japanese regulators -- some analysts believe warrant prices
are off as much as two-thirds.
   Worse, many warrants may expire soon, making them
worthless to holders, among them big institutional investors
such as fund managers and insurance companies. And if
investors don't exercise the warrants and buy stock, some of
the companies that issued the warrants will lose a crucial
source of expected new capital.
   "The market is nervous," Trevor Sliwerski, an executive at
Baring Securities Co. in London, said. "Many warrants are
bombed out." A trader at S.G. Warburg Securities Co. said,
"Nobody in his right mind would own some of these."
   Investors bought equity warrants on the theory that
Japanese stocks would head eternally higher. Until the market
began to tumble this year, the bet usually paid off. A year
or two after issue, many warrants gave investors the right to
buy stock at only a fraction of market prices. Now that the
stock market has reversed, though, many of those warrants
don't look so attractive.
   By the estimate of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., the value
of the equity-warrant market has shrunk to about $14 billion
from $34 billion at the start of the year.
   Warrants make money when stock prices climb above the
so-called strike price, the set price at which the warrant
holder has the right to buy shares offered by the issuing
company. Such warrants are considered "in the money."
   When stock prices are below the strike price, however, a
warrant is considered "out of the money." An investor would
have to pay more to exercise his stock-purchase rights than
the price at which the stock could then be sold, producing a
loss.
   Most Japanese equity warrants are out of the money.
According to a survey by S.G. Warburg, only 102 of 500 major
warrant issues were still in the money two weeks ago. And the
Tokyo stock market has tumbled further since then.
   Because equity warrants expire on a certain date, those
that are nearing expiration aren't even trading. "There's no
point in buying something that isn't ever going to be back in
the money," a trader said.
   Who are the big losers? Japanese investment trusts and
trust banks, mostly. Life insurance companies and, to a
lesser extent, banks and overseas investors also have
incurred losses. But James Bush of Barclays said losses from
warrant trading don't present a problem for most of Japan's
cash-rich investors.
   "To a big Japanese investment trust, that kind of loss
hurts, but it's not crippling," he said. Even before the
warrant market contracted, he pointed out, its total
capitalization was the equivalent of only a fraction of the
assets of Japan's largest bank.
   He also said the market isn't suffering from panic
selling. "To some extent, the warrant market has stopped
falling" recently, Mr. Bush said, as the prices offered on
new warrants sink so low that investors are becoming
interested in them again. One issue, by Nomura Securities
Co., is trading at $2.50, down from a high of $90 two years
ago. The warrant gives holders the right to buy Nomura stock
at a level 61% above its current market price.
   Not surprisingly, investors aren't exactly beating the
doors down to buy them. "People are still afraid to trade
against the trend, even though terms for warrants are now
technically very attractive," Mr. Bush said. "Everybody who
wanted to pick the bottom of this market has given up,
because they've been wrong so many times."
   Mr. Bush said warrant holders needn't panic yet. Of the
400 warrant issues traded by Barclays, he said, none expires
this year and only 12 expire in 1991. Most reach the end of
their term in 1993. As long as the expiration date is far off
in the future, even warrants that are out of the money have
"time value," because theoretically stock prices could rise
again.
   But if the market hasn't made a substantial recovery
within the next couple of years, many big investors will be
stuck with fistfuls of worthless paper.
   Even the giant Japanese securities companies weren't
prepared for the market to shrivel. The Big Four firms,
Nomura, Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and
Yamaichi Securities Co., earned as much as one-third of their
profits in the fiscal year ended March 31 through
warrant-bond underwriting and trading. Their earnings could
be halved by the crisis in the market, analysts said.
   So far this year, $12 billion of warrant bonds have been
issued, down more than 75% from the value of warrants issued
during the first nine months of last year. Barclays believes
the market will finish the year at about $20 billion -- about
where it ended 1987.
