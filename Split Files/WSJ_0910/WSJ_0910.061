   MONROE, Ohio -- First Financial Bancorp said it will take
a charge of $4.5 million against 1990 earnings to cover loan
losses at its First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio.
   For 1989, First Financial reported net income of $15.2
million, or $3.01 a share.

   The bank holding company said the onetime charge,
estimated to be $3 million, or 60 cents a share, is linked to
the default on three commercial real estate loans.
   First Financial has assets of $1.2 billion and operates
banks in Ohio and Indiana.
