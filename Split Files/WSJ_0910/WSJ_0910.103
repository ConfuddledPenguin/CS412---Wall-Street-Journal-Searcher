   LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. again extended its
$22-a-share tender offer for the 2,175,945 shares of Caesars
New Jersey Inc. it doesn't already own to midnight Sept. 21
from last Friday.
   The hotel and casino operator holds about 86.6% of Caesars
New Jersey's 16,261,531 common shares outstanding. As of
Thursday, about 1,783,567 shares had been tendered.

<TEXT>
   Caesars World has agreed in principle to make an
additional payment of 25 cents a share as part of a
settlement of lawsuits brought by some Caesars New Jersey
shareholders. Final court approval isn't expected for at
least two months.
   Caesars also said the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
has scheduled a hearing Sept. 19 to consider a petition filed
by a Caesars New Jersey holder alleging, among other things,
that the $22-a-share price is inadequate. The hearing is to
determine whether the petitioner has the standing to bring
the issue before the regulators.
