   Continuing our anomalous but predictable history of
national energy "strategies," the Bush administration has
decided that the best way to reduce the danger of oil-supply
disruptions in the Middle East is to -- produce more oil]
("Energy Department Unveils Strategy to Cut U. S. Dependence
on Mideast Oil," Aug. 16.)
   Citing such bold actions as fully inflating tires, car
pooling and increased oil production from offshore California
and the North Slope of Alaska, the administration has
followed the path of least resistance, and least controversy,
in failing to address the country's dangerous reliance on
foreign oil.

   Hydro, wind, geothermal, biomass and solar power currently
account for 10% of America's energy needs. A conservative
report -- issued, incidentally, by the Department of Energy
-- concludes that renewables could provide nearly 30% of our
total energy supply. Yet federal research and development
budgets for renewable technologies have taken draconian cuts,
dropping to less than $95 million from $557 million in the
past decade (non-adjusted).
   Concerted federal efforts to encourage "economies of
scale" in the development of renewables, combined with
increased emphasis on energy efficiency, could mitigate
significantly the strategic consequences of Saddam Hussein's
belligerence.

   I was surprised and disappointed, in reading your Aug. 17
page-one article on "Energy Options," to see not one mention
of the potential contribution of ethanol from renewable
agricultural resources as a fuel enhancer and extender. This
is a one-billion-gallon-per-year industry today. American
farmers certainly have the capacity and the desire to make an
even greater contribution to reducing America's reliance on
imported oil for motor fuel. With today's corn prices, oil
prices and government incentives the production of ethanol
from grain is profitable. This home-grown resource should not
be ignored in responding to our current energy problems.
