   U.S. computer makers fear a proposed European standard for
computer security will undercut their competitiveness in
their largest overseas market.
   "This could make it harder for U.S. companies to sell
computers in Europe," said Steven Walker, president of
Trusted Information Systems Inc. "I see this as a real
threat."

   Observers fear that Europe's embattled computer industry
might try to use a security standard as a way to throw up
fresh barriers to its home market by requiring that every
system sold in Europe meet these specifications.
   "In Europe, governments can impose these standards on all
data-processing equipment -- and that locks U.S.
manufacturers right out of the whole business," said Robert
Courtney, a computer consultant in Port Ewen, N.Y. Currently,
each European nation has its own guidelines for computer
security.
   Now, four nations -- France, Germany, the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands -- are pushing for a single European
standard. In May, the four nations released their initial
proposal, dubbed "IT Sec" for short. At a meeting scheduled
for Sept. 25 in Brussels, executives from International
Business Machines Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and other U.S.
computer makers will receive their first chance to critique
the plan. Officials from the Commerce Department also are
preparing a position paper on the subject.
   The U.S. already has its own computer security standard,
established by the National Security Agency and nicknamed the
"orange book." The standard officially covers only those
computer systems used by the government in classified work.
But often government agencies doing sensitive but
unclassified work and even commercial users such as banks
request that their computer systems meet orange book
guidelines.
   However, Europeans contend that the orange book is tied
too closely to military needs and that a security standard
ought to be crafted to satisfy civilian commercial users.
   "We want {a standard} to be equally applicable to
military-oriented systems and commercial systems," said Chris
Jahl, a West German computer expert who coauthored the
proposed IT Sec.
   Mr. Jahl said it hasn't been decided whether the European
Commission will adopt the proposed standard but acknowledged
that it could apply to most computers sold in Europe. He said
the European approach gives users more flexibility than the
orange book, which he described as rigid.
   Many large computer makers are alarmed by the European
plan. Digital will send two representatives to the Brussels
meeting and already has urged the European group to embrace a
standard that resembles the orange book. IBM, the world's
largest computer company, declined to comment but is said to
be unhappy with the development.
   The fear is that the emergence of a second standard would
force computer makers to build two versions of the same
product, one for Europe and another for the U.S. market,
executives say.
   "While we probably could sell the same hardware, we might
have to do major surgery to the operating system," or the
software that controls a computer's basic functions, said
Geoffrey Baehr, director of data communication and networking
at Sun Microsystems Inc.
   Experts in computer security are hoping to persuade the
Europeans to adopt security guidelines that closely resemble
existing U.S. guidelines. Mr. Jahl said he believes at least
half of the perceived differences between the two standards
will be smoothed over as a result of the Brussels meeting but
that some basic disagreements are likely to remain.
   That prospect puts U.S. computer makers "in a quandary,"
said one U.S. government official who asked not to be named.
"The worst case is that the U.S. posture and the European
posture {become} dramatically different," said Willis Rand, a
consultant at Rand Corp. "What does our industry design to
then? Do they make two sets of designs? That's a terrible
situation to be in."
   Some observers blame this unattractive situation on the
National Security Agency, the secretive branch of the Defense
Department that generally set federal policy on computer
security in the 1980s.
   Because of an NSA decision, for instance, computers made
by European concerns are effectively ineligible to receive a
stamp of approval from the NSA, which administers orange book
evaluations. "In our eyes, that's a barrier to us," said
Germany's Mr. Jahl. While he wouldn't say that the snub
inspired the European standards effort, he conceded that the
IT Sec "puts some pressure on the Department of Defense."
   The pressure comes with the Pentagon already backpedaling
from its traditional involvement in computer security policy.
At a congressional hearing in July, members of the House of
Representatives urged the Commerce Department to speed
efforts to begin crafting guidelines for a wide range of
commercial computer uses.
   The same month, President Bush reportedly issued a
directive to the NSA removing its authority over security for
commercial systems and for government systems that handle
unclassified information. The directive, NSD-42, is
classified, but a government official who asked not to be
named said it "pretty clearly says {the NSA} should not be
addressing unclassified systems."
   U.S. computer makers are generally satisfied with the
orange book standard. "A lot of vendors have viewed an NSA
endorsement as help," said Mr. Walker of Trusted Information.
But he said it takes too long to gain approval from the NSA's
evaluation unit and that demand for evaluations far outstrips
the NSA's resources. As a result, he said, he believes
there's a need for a civilian counterpart to the NSA's orange
book but sees little prospect of one coming along: A 1987 law
gave the Commerce Department authority in this area, but not
the budget to do the job.
