   WASHINGTON -- Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan has selected Bernadine Healy, a cardiologist, to
become the director of the National Institutes of Health.
   In addition, HHS officials said that Dr. Sullivan is about
to choose David Kessler, the medical director of the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York, as the next
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

   Dr. Kessler, a former aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah),
is a member of an HHS advisory committee examining the FDA,
which has lately suffered from problems ranging from
inspector shortages to revelations of fraud in the
generic-drug approval process. The FDA post has been vacant
since last November, and the nomination would require Senate
confirmation.
   HHS officials said that Dr. Sullivan already has asked the
White House to clear the appointment of Dr. Healy, who is
chairman of the Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation. Dr. Healy won't be formally offered the National
Institutes post until the White House approves, but HHS
officials said she has told Dr. Sullivan she is interested in
the directorship of the world's leading medical research
organization.
   A member of Dr. Healy's office said she was on vacation
and couldn't be reached for comment.
   The appointment of Dr. Healy would be a coup for Dr.
Sullivan. Her prestige would help address recent complaints
in Congress and elsewhere that the National Institutes has
paid insufficient attention to diseases affecting women, to
testing promising new therapies on women and to promoting
women researchers. Dr. Healy, a former president of the
American Heart Association, has spoken out publicly on the
need to move more women into leadership positions in medical
research and administration.
   The National Institutes post has been vacant since Aug. 1,
1989, when the Bush administration's anti-abortion politics
forced Director James Wyngaarden to resign. Several prominent
physicians, including Anthony Fauci, who heads the AIDS
research program at the National Institutes, and William
Danforth, the chancellor of Washington University in St.
Louis and the brother of Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), have
rejected the job.
   Scientists have said that the post's relatively low salary
and limited authority, as well as fears that the
administration's anti-abortion policies would limit some
research initiatives, have made the National Institutes post
difficult to fill.
   To address these concerns, Dr. Sullivan announced that the
White House had assured him that "standards of scientific and
administrative excellence and leadership," not politics,
would prevail in the selection. He also has vowed to seek
more authority and pay for the National Institutes director.
Currently, the National Institutes director makes around
$100,000 annually, about half what heads of medical school
departments earn.
   Dr. Healy's appointment would show that the administration
isn't imposing an ideological litmus test for the National
Institutes post. HHS officials said Dr. Healy has opposed the
administration's ban on the use of fetal tissue in research.
The administration fears that if fetal-tissue transplants led
to new treatments for such degenerative diseases as
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, pressure for abortions could
rise. Dr. Healy has served as the president of the American
Federation for Clinical Research, which has opposed the
government's ban on fetal-tissue research.
   Dr. Healy has some Washington experience. She is a member
of President Bush's Council of Advisers on Science and
Technology, and she was deputy director of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy from February 1984
through September 1985.
   At the Cleveland Clinic, which is headed by her husband,
Floyd Loop, Dr. Healy has worked aggressively to boost the
budget and prestige of the Research Institute. Research
funding grew to $36 million last year from $8 million in
1985, with much of the money coming from the National
Institutes.
   By contrast, the National Institutes budget is $7.6
billion this year. Yet the National Institutes faces a
variety of problems -- funding hasn't kept up with research
demands and many talented scientists are leaving for higher
paying jobs elsewhere. In addition, the new National
Institutes director will face a host of complex policy issues
ranging from how to prevent research fraud to developing
rules to sorting out the ethical and legal issues that arise
as scientists learn how to analyze genes to detect disease
and manipulate genes in an effort to cure or prevent disease.
