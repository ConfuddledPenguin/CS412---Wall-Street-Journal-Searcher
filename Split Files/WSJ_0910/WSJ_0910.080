   TORONTO -- The leader of Ontario's New Democratic Party
sought to reassure a nervous business community after his
socialist party was elected to rule Canada's most important
province.
   Party leader Bob Rae told a news conference that he would
respect private property and be "fiscally responsible." He
said he wanted "a market that works efficiently and fairly
and . . . a business community that has confidence in the
future."

   Mr. Rae noted that socialist-led governments have worked
comfortably with business in several West European nations.
   The New Democrats won 74 of the 130 seats in Ontario's
legislature in Thursday's election. Under Canada's
parliamentary system, that means Mr. Rae will form a New
Democratic cabinet and take office as provincial premier late
this month.
   The party's surprise victory is of national consequence
because Ontario accounts for more than 40% of Canada's output
and contains more than a third of its people. Its government
is de facto regulator of the Canadian securities industry,
which is concentrated in Ontario. The New Democrats have
governed smaller provinces but had never won in Ontario.
   The party's provincial platform includes many promises
that worry business executives, including 4.22 billion
Canadian dollars ($3.65 billion) in additional spending in
the next two years and C$2.38 billion in new taxes. The taxes
would include an 8% minimum tax on corporate profits, a
"speculation tax" of up to 90% on profits from some
real-estate sales and an inheritance tax on estates above C$1
million.
   "The last thing Canada needs is any more contribution to
government deficits," said Andrew Kniewasser, president of
the Investment Dealers Association of Canada, an industry
group. He said an inheritance tax would encourage investors
to move savings out of Ontario.
   The party also promised to take over the auto-insurance
industry and impose more regulation on everything from plant
closings to the comparative wages of men and women in private
businesses.
   Business spokespersons were reluctant to criticize Mr.
Rae, instead emphasizing hopes to persuade him not to take
steps that might hurt the economy.
   "They are going to be the party in power for the next five
years and reasonable people want to work with them," said
Linda Matthews, president of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce.
"Rae is very knowledgeable and sophisticated about financial
and economic matters," said Mr. Kniewasser. He said the
investment dealers group already has asked for an early
meeting with Mr. Rae.
   The New Democratic rank and file is drawn largely from
labor unions, but the 42-year-old Mr. Rae is a lawyer and
former Rhodes Scholar who went to high school in Switzerland.
His father was Canadian ambassador to Mexico and the United
Nations. His brother is vice president of Montreal-based
Power Corp. of Canada, one of the country's largest holding
companies. Mr. Rae's moderate image helped defuse opponents'
warnings that Ontario would be subject to "cockamamie
socialism" if the New Democrats won.
   Mr. Rae already has shown caution about hasty imposition
of his party's platform. At his news conference he noted that
a pledge to raise the minimum wage 40% will take several
years to carry out. Opposition to the two-year-old
U.S.-Canada free trade agreement was an element in his
campaign, but Mr. Rae told the news conference that killing
the agreement is a matter for the federal rather than
provincial governments.
   The New Democrats have a weak popular mandate. They won
only 38% of the vote, but gained a majority in parliament
because other ballots were split among two other parties and
an unusually large 7% protest vote for splinter
organizations. Their victory was mainly seen as a repudiation
of the former Liberal Party government of David Peterson, who
lost his own seat in the legislature. Even Mr. Rae said he
was surprised at the size of his party's victory.
   The election results helped push down the Canadian dollar
and Canadian stock prices. The Canadian dollar fell Friday to
85.98 U.S. cents from 86.49 cents. The Toronto Stock
Exchange's composite index of 300 stocks fell 25.78 to
3287.78. Brokers cautioned, however, that some of the decline
was caused by the announcement Friday of a
bigger-than-expected rise in Canada's unemployment rate.
