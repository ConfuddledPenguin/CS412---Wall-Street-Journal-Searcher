   BAGHDAD -- A visit to the hideout of Abul Abbas, one of
the world's most wanted men, begins with a rubber-burning
drive down the back streets of the Iraqi capital.
   The driver loops twice past an anonymous house in an
anonymous neighborhood, honking each time so guards can check
that the Mercedes isn't being tailed. On the third pass, the
car veers into the driveway. Stern young men with submachine
guns lurk in the bushes. At the door of the one-story villa,
a guard frisks a visiting reporter and tests his
tape-recorder -- with the machine's microphone pointed at the
journalist's neck.

   Mr. Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, waits
in an office decorated with photos of his commandos setting
off in speedboats to strike Israel. "I am sorry for the
welcome," he says, gesturing at guards posted by his window.
"This is my life."
   Mr. Abbas's life, as it unfolds in a three-hour interview
over tea, Turkish coffee and two packs of Marlboro
cigarettes, is the chilling tale of the making of a
terrorist. It begins in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria
and leads to this Baghdad lair, where Mr. Abbas plotted the
1985 Achille Lauro hijacking and this year's attack on a Tel
Aviv beach, which ended America's dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Now, with his Iraqi patron, Saddam Hussein, under seige by
U.S. forces, Mr. Abbas thinks the time may soon be ripe for
renewed commando warfare.
   "We see this as the battle for Palestine," he says of the
Persian Gulf conflict. "Winning it will get us closer to
home. Losing it will put us further away." Asked if terrorism
is a necessary part of Saddam Hussein's struggle, he
responds: "We use many ways to reach our aim."
   In apparent anticipation of guerrilla strikes, the U.S.
State Department took the unusual step of issuing a statement
at 8:30 p.m. Friday saying, "The United States would view
with utmost seriousness any Iraqi-sponsored terrorist
attack." Iraq was restored to the department's list of
governments sponsoring terrorism on Sept. 1.
   Among radical Palestinian leaders, Mr. Abbas's position is
exceptional. His rap sheet of what he calls "military
operations" -- and what the West calls terrorism -- is
exceeded only by the shadowy Abu Nidal and by Ahmed Jebril,
who is believed to have masterminded the bombing of Pan Am
flight 103.
   But Mr. Abbas also sits on the PLO's 15-man executive
committee, and therefore has a voice within the Palestinian
mainstream. "Abul Abbas is a symbol, to show that the PLO
hasn't abandoned armed struggle," says Asad Abdul Rahman, a
member of the PLO's parliament in exile.
   To many in the West, Mr. Abbas is a much darker symbol:
violent, uncompromising and determined to torpedo efforts at
peacefully resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Helena
Cobban, a Washington-based PLO expert and author of a leading
book on the organization, describes Mr. Abbas as "a low-level
thug" and a "mercenary gun-for-hire" who has no real
political program. Long on the Iraqi payroll, he could become
useful to Saddam Hussein if he decides to "activate the
terror option," she says.
   Although Mr. Abbas says he only strikes at Israeli
"military targets," civilians often have been cut down in the
crossfire. In a 1979 raid by PLF gunmen on the Israeli town
of Nahariya, the four Israeli deaths included a four-year-old
girl; a PLF commando crushed her skull with a machine gun.
   Meeting an American in Baghdad for what he says is the
first time, Mr. Abbas cuts an imposing, rather incongruous
figure. Broad-shouldered and six feet four inches tall, he
has the strong but softening build of a retired lumberjack.
Ruggedly handsome, his thick black hair and mustache show no
signs of gray at 41. His eyes don't give much away; in the
dimly-lit office, they are so dark as to seem all pupil.
   Mr. Abbas's manner is disarming. Soft-voiced, his face
wrinkles easily into laughter. He speaks passable English and
florid Arabic, filled with metaphor and rhythmic locutions. A
graduate in Arabic literature from the University of
Damascus, he also appears to be well-read. His favorite
Western writer, he says, is William Shakespeare --
"particularly the tragedies." He says he was a schoolteacher
in Syria before becoming a full-time "freedom fighter."
   This second career has left its mark. Brushing back his
hair, Mr. Abbas reveals a jagged scar across his forehead,
the result, he says, of an Israeli cluster bomb during the
siege of Beirut in 1982. He also has a bullet wound in each
thigh from guerrilla fighting in Jordan and the West Bank.
"That's the life," he says, chuckling grimly.
   Asked if he has personally killed anyone, he responds with
a half-smile, "During the fight, you don't know what
happens." He adds that what happens in the heat of battle
"isn't just killing" because "this is war. Israel is our
enemy."
   As for innocents who have died in this war, he shrugs.
"Accidents happen," he says.
   Mr. Abbas welcomes the current Gulf conflict, which is
gathering Palestinian extremists beneath the Iraqi tent in
company with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Last week, a leading
radical, Syrian-based George Habash, made his first visit in
11 years to Baghdad, where he met with both Mr. Abbas and
Saddam Hussein. Palestinian sources say Abu Nidal already is
in Iraq. And Mr. Abbas predicts that others, such as Mr.
Jebril, also may soon defect from Syria to Saddam Hussein's
camp.
   "I think Saddam will win, and we will win as Arabs," Mr.
Abbas says. "When we support Iraq, we support our case as
Palestinians."
   While Mr. Abbas won't disclose what this support might
include, past exploits give some clue to future attacks.
"Ruthless stunts that often go wrong" is how one Palestinian
official describes PLF operations.
   The group has staged strikes on Israel by hang glider, by
hot-air balloon, by rubber dinghy and, most notoriously, by
seajacking the cruise liner Achille Lauro (which he says was
to be taken to Israel, in part to free PLF fighters captured
in the 1979 Nahariya attack).
   It was during the bungled Achille Lauro mission, when a
wheelchair-bound American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was
killed, that Mr. Abbas became known internationally. The
world's most wanted terrorist, with U.S. warrants out for his
arrest for hostage-taking and piracy, he eluded a global
manhunt, reportedly disguised in an Egyptair uniform. An
Italian court later convicted him in absentia and sentenced
him to life imprisonment.
   Mr. Abbas is unapologetic for the death of the crippled
Mr. Klinghoffer, who was shot in the head and back and pushed
overboard. "Maybe he was trying to swim for it," Mr. Abbas
coldly suggested in 1988. Asked about the incident again last
week, he bristled. "Klinghoffer, always I hear about this
Klinghoffer," he says. "Nobody knows all the people who die
in Palestine. But this Klinghoffer is like Jesus Christ."
   Mr. Abbas also has no regrets over the failed attack on a
crowded Tel Aviv beach last May. It was Mr. Arafat's refusal
to denounce Mr. Abbas following the attack that led the U.S.
to suspend its dialogue with the PLO. Four commandos were
killed and 12 captured in what Mr. Abbas says was an assault
aimed at military targets. "For two years we say yes, yes,
yes to America, without results," he says of the dialogue.
"Political ways have stopped now. Only we will fight."
   Mr. Abbas says he still would welcome a negotiated
settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. But asked if he is
prepared to recognize Israel, as Mr. Arafat has done, he
responds: "For me, for our organization, we will not. We want
our land now and to build our state. After that we will say."
   Mr. Abbas's hard-line views reflect the militancy of a new
generation of Palestinians. In contrast to other splinter
groups, some Marxist and others fundamentalist, the PLF
appeals to young militants devoted to action rather than to
ideology. Members are carefully ranked, in military style,
and tend to wear blue jeans, white shirts and combat boots.
   One fiery-eyed lieutenant in Baghdad, who goes by the name
of Abu Nahar, says he follows Mr. Abbas because the PLF "is
focused, rational, not emotional." He adds that all members
of the PLF, which may have a hard core of only 100, "must
prove themselves in battle."
   Mr. Abbas, ranked as secretary-general, is the youngest
member of the PLO's executive committee and the only one born
outside of what is now Israel and its occupied territories.
His parents fled their village near Haifa in 1948, just after
the founding of Israel. Mohammed Zaidan Abbas was born a few
months later, in a Syrian refugee camp. The only image he has
of his family's village is from videotapes taken by friends
who have visited since.
   Mr. Abbas says it is this separation from his homeland
that has made him so radical. Members of the PLO's old guard,
he says, "can balance between the truth and the dream. But
for me, no. Everything is a dream. And dreams are always more
powerful than reality."
   As a university student, Mr. Abbas says, he wanted to be a
professor of literature. But the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and
the occupation of the West Bank that followed, convinced him
that "if I as a Palestinian do not fight now, then I am
nothing."
   While finishing his degree, and working briefly as a
teacher, he plotted with other Palestinians and made several
raids across the Jordan River. In 1968, he joined Mr.
Jebril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, and combed the camps of Jordan for
recruits.
   From there, his rise through the PLO ranks was slow but
steady, aided since 1983 by the Iraqis and also by his second
marriage to a close relative of Farouk Kaddoumi, a leading
Arafat adviser.
   Once known as a playboy, he has settled down and talks
proudly of the oldest of his three sons, a teen-age computer
whiz. Palestinians in Baghdad say he is rarely seen anymore
outside his closely-guarded compound.
   "This is my life," he says, casting his glance around the
cluttered office. Lieutentants slip in and out with whispered
missives. Papers are piled on his desk, with spectacles
perched on top. "I live only for my dream," he says.
   Like so many Palestinians, Mr. Abbas takes a very long
view of his dream of regaining his homeland. "There is an
Arabic saying that revenge takes 40 years," he says. "If not
my son, then the son of my son will kill you. Some day, we
will have missiles that can reach New York."
