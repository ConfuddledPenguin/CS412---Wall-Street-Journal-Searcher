   NEW YORK -- There is no relief in sight for the run-down
dollar.
   With heavy central bank support seen as unlikely and the
Federal Reserve still expected to ease soon to resuscitate
the feeble U.S. economy, many currency traders say the dollar
has nowhere to go but down.

   "The downtrend is still intact," says Thomas Benfer, a
foreign exchange marketing representative at the Bank of
Montreal. "People still are looking for a lower dollar."
   Late Friday here, the dollar was quoted at 1.5679 marks
and 140.05 yen, compared with 1.5550 marks and 140.70 yen
late Thursday. The pound fell to $1.8930 from $1.9125.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
139.50 yen, down from 140.25 yen at the close there Friday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5655
marks, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.5603 marks.
   Bearish sentiment about the dollar didn't abate Friday
despite the dollar's rise against most foreign currencies on
U.S. employment data for August which, while unimpressive,
weren't sharply weaker than traders had expected.
   The unemployment rate rose to 5.6% last month from 5.5% in
July, while nonfarm payrolls fell 75,000 in August after
dropping 89,000. Not including census worker layoffs,
non-farm payrolls in August climbed 45,000 after rising
84,000 in July.
   Some economists had forecast a 5.5% August unemployment
rate and an overall non-farm payrolls decrease of roughly
29,000.
   The U.S. economy, a top concern of the foreign-exchange
market, may be on the back burner early this week because of
the Group of Seven meeting in Paris today and tomorrow. The
G-7, the world's major industrial nations, are the U.S., West
Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   A U.S. Treasury official said Thursday that officials from
those nations will convene to address the dollar's plunge and
the impact of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis on international
economies.
   Currency dealings are growing cautious because of
uncertainties about the outcome of the gathering, but some
traders are already betting that forceful rounds of
dollar-supporting intervention won't be seen anytime soon.
   That's because the G-7 isn't expected to throw lots of
money away trying to lift a dollar that is burdened by many
bearish fundamentals, such as the ailing U.S. economy and the
nation's relatively unattractive interest rates.
   Some currency specialists say heavy G-7 dollar support is
also unlikely at this time because the dollar's severe
weakness, while worrisome, holds benefits for the U.S., West
Germany and Japan.
   Though a weaker dollar can fuel inflationary pressures in
the U.S. by making imports more expensive, it can also spur
exports by cutting the costs of the nation's goods for
foreigners. That would help pare a 1990 U.S. merchandise
trade deficit that totaled $45.81 billion through June.
   Overseas, mark and yen strength resulting from the lower
dollar helps curb inflationary pressures in West Germany and
Japan.
   The New York Federal Reserve Bank said Friday that the
U.S. didn't move to prop up the dollar between May and July
although the currency fell 5.5% against the mark and 8%
against the yen. That marked the first time the U.S.
refrained from dollar-guiding intervention since the
August-October 1986 quarter.
   The U.S. Treasury's restraint in part reflects a new
political reality. Since the beginning of the year, the
Treasury's exchange-rate policies have come under attack from
the Fed and Congress. Some Fed officials complain the
Treasury's earlier massive interventions were potentially
costly and having little effect on the dollar's value while
undercutting the Fed's anti-inflation efforts. The Fed does
the actual buying and selling of dollars, but usually the
Treasury calls the shots in consultation with the Fed.
   A total purchase of $2 billion against the mark during the
latest quarter -- $1 billion bought in the open market and $1
billion purchased directly from another central bank -- was
for technical Treasury transactions, according to the New
York Fed.
   The last time the U.S. intervened to support the dollar
was at the end of 1988. The U.S. and other nations spent much
of last year unsuccessfully attempting to put a lid on a
dollar that was confoundingly resilient.
   In the short run, the G-7 officials "clearly are going to
be watching this {dollar downtrend} very carefully," says
David Blitzer, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   However, Mr. Blitzer and other economists say there
probably won't be intervention unless the dollar's downward
momentum accelerates sharply, causing declines of much more
than a pfennig or a yen per day.
   Recent dollar bashing has been seen orderly, even though
it caused the dollar to trade at an 11-month intraday low of
139.90 yen Friday and a post-World War II low of 1.5385 marks
on Aug. 27. The dollar, no longer regarded as a choice haven,
has received little support from the turmoil in the Persian
Gulf.
   Traders are now gearing up to push the dollar toward 1.50
marks and 135 yen, some currency analysts say.
   Even if there is intervention, it isn't expected to give
the dollar much of a boost. "People will definitely still
sell dollars," says Rick Porter, manager of corporate
dealings at Westpac Banking Corp. "There's a good fundamental
reason for being bearish on the dollar" that won't be erased
by intervention.
   The main thorns in the dollar's foot are abundant evidence
of U.S. economic weakness and speculation that more Fed
credit loosening is likely soon.
   The U.S. central bank is perceived to be reluctant to ease
with oil prices rocketing because of the Gulf crisis, but
many economists believe easing is around the bend.
   Lower interest rates can undercut a currency because they
curb demand for investments denominated in the currency.
   Fed easing would be particularly troublesome for the
dollar right now because other major industrial nations are
maintaining tight policies.
   "I think they {the Fed} will still ease," says Standard &amp;
Poor's Mr. Blitzer. The federal funds rate, he says, may be
allowed to fall 1/4 percentage point to 7.75% from the
perceived target rate of 8% as early as this week. The
federal funds rate is the charge on reserves traded among
commercial banks overnight.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $389.50 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 4.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $386.80 an ounce.
