   Wayne A. Budd, U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, said that
if the case went to trial, the government would have
introduced evidence that during the fall of 1987 and the
spring of 1988, Mr. Crupi falsified information concerning
the purchase price, income and assets of ComFed borrowers at
a condominium development in Revere, Mass. The goverment
alleged that Mr. Crupi entered into the scheme to defraud
ComFed to obtain greater commissions on the loans he
originated.
   Sentencing was set for Nov. 2. Mr. Crupi faces a maximum
sentence of 40 years in prison and $2,750,000 in fines.
