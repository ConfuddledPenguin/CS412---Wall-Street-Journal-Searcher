   Time Warner, which has been trumpeting its ability to
offer advertisers media packages cutting across its
magazines, videos and other services, has finally found its
first big taker: Prodigy, the videotext-service joint venture
between Sears Roebuck and International Business Machines.
   Next month, subscribers of Time, People, Money and certain
issues of Sports Illustrated will be greeted with customized
ads that welcome them by name and tell them the name and
address of the nearest Prodigy dealer.

   But the deal goes a few steps further.
   Time also has coordinated the airing of TV commercials on
cable networks promoting the issues that feature the "special
advertising message from Prodigy." Newspaper stands will have
signs promoting the ads -- and the issues. Shoppers in malls
with which Time has ad contracts will see ads urging them to
visit the mall's Prodigy outlet. Readers who stop in and try
out Prodigy will get a gift -- their choice of a Sports
Illustrated "football bloopers" video or software developed
by Money magazine.
   American Isuzu Motors last year was the first advertiser
to run personalized ads in Time's magazines. But that service
hasn't attracted quite as many takers as Time initially
forecast, leading some industry executives to question
whether it is a short-term gimmick or a marketing tool that
is here to stay. Time predicted there would be at least a
dozen such deals in 1990, but there will probably only be
about seven or eight.
   Nevertheless, the Prodigy deal is big news for Time and
represents the most far-reaching marketing deal it has ever
struck with an advertiser. The multidimensional nature of the
program goes far beyond Isuzu's personalized-ad deal.
   "We didn't just throw together a couple of magazines, a
mall poster and some ad time on CNN -- all of which we have
access to," says Richard Heinemann, newly appointed vice
president of advertising for Time Inc. Magazines. "We've
pulled together a number of different events, but they all
work together to create a total marketing effect."
   Prodigy says it was attracted to Time because it offered a
splashy venue to get out the message that its service is
available nationwide. "We needed to have a highly visible,
high-impact event that would create a lot of attention," says
Stephen Walden, director of membership marketing at Prodigy.
   Surprisingly, Mr. Walden and executives at its ad agency,
WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson unit, boast about the cost
efficiency of the deal with Time. Because of the cooperative
advertising nature of the deal -- the magazines get plugged
in the commercials just like Prodigy, for example -- Time's
fee was attractive, Mr. Walden says, while declining to
disclose the terms.
   Regardless, such marketing packages aren't cheap. The
process of selective binding alone, which is required to make
personalized ads in magazines, is terribly expensive. Most
advertisers, some industry executives argue, don't have the
budgets to cover such fancy ad programs. Others can spring
for a big spread only every once in a while.
   "Maybe only a few people will end up using this, and it
will turn out to be a financial catastrophe," says Robert
Cohen, president of Robert Cohen Associates, a magazine
consulting firm in New York. "But I think advertisers are
looking for value-added services, and this could be a
tremendously competitive advantage for Time Warner."
   That's what Time is betting on, even in today's tight
media environment. Executives at the company say it is close
to finalizing at least two similar contracts, and those may
well tap resources that Time got in its merger with Warner,
such as video production, books or syndicated TV. And Time
predicts about 50% of the advertisers who use the
personalized ad service this year will sign up again next
year.
   "We feel very good about the program," says Bruce Judson,
Time's director of marketing. "It's not for everybody, . . .
but we think this can help advertisers get the greatest bang
for their marketing dollar."

   Benson &amp; Hedges De-Nic
                                                                                                       

   Philip Morris will unveil Benson &amp; Hedges De-Nic, a brand
with virtually no nicotine, on Oct. 1 in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The test marketing of the new cigarette under the umbrella
of one of Philip Morris's most upscale brands represents an
effort by the tobacco maker to hang onto the young and trendy
set -- and to win over smokers concerned about nicotine.
   Philip Morris has also been testing a low-nicotine version
of its Merit brand. But the moves are risky. The availability
of these very-low nicotine cigarettes may prove most
effective at reminding smokers of the risks of standard
cigarettes.
   "Every time a coffee drinker sees an ad for decaffeinated
coffee, it suggests that coffee isn't very good for you,"
says Al Ries, chairman of Trout &amp; Ries, a Greenwich, Conn.,
marketing consultancy. The same thing will happen with these
smokes, he says, and the move will further depress overall
cigarette sales.
   The advertising for the new cigarette has been created by
Leo Burnett. The agency also handles Next, Philip Morris's
first low-nicotine smoke, which has been in test market since
1988. The ads will introduce Benson &amp; Hedges De-Nic in
modern-looking white and light blue packaging.
   The campaign comes as Leo Burnett has also been asked to
look in on the flagship Benson &amp; Hedges brand, which has been
plagued by declining market share despite high-profile
advertising from Wells, Rich, Greene. Although Philip Morris
won't comment officially, insiders say Leo Burnett is
suggesting ways of upgrading the quality of individual ads.
   Wells Rich, though, has come up with yet another campaign
for the brand, and Philip Morris plans to put it through a
series of ad tests soon. The new ads are expected to
particularly target men age 25 to 35, a group that has been
forsaking the brand in droves. Philip Morris hopes to have
the new campaign in place by the beginning of the year.

   KOALA SPRINGS: Koala Springs, Fremont, Calif., will keep
its $4 million to $5 million account at Goldberg Moser
O'Neill, the former San Francisco office of Chiat/Day/Mojo.
Chiat/Day, when it sold that office to management this past
summer, said the Koala Springs business would move to its Los
Angeles office.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: Gemstar Development Corp., Los Angeles,
awarded the ad account for VCR Plus+, its VCR-programming
product, to J. Walter Thompson, Los Angeles. Billings weren't
disclosed.
