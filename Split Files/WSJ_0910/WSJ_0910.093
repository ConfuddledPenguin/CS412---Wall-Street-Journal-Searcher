   Oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is rebounding after the August plunge caused by the
Mideast crisis.
   Leading producers are starting to make good on promises to
pump more crude to replace embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil,
according to those who monitor OPEC output. They said,
however, that total OPEC production probably won't reach
pre-crisis levels of more than 23 million barrels a day until
late in the year, if then.

   An anticipated gap in total crude oil supplies this month,
caused by the six-week shipping lag for Middle East oil to
reach world markets, isn't expected to be a large problem,
industry analysts said. Crude inventories, particularly in
the U.S., are high. If tight supplies or shortages do appear,
they'll probably involve only some refined products and some
regions, the analysts said.
   "There could be product imbalances," said Cristina Haus,
who monitors OPEC production for Washington-based Energy
Security Analysis. "There will be no problem in crude oil."
In addition to an increase of as much as two million barrels
a day in crude oil produced by Saudi Arabia, she said she
foresees the September output increase by the United Arab
Emirates to be more than the generally estimated 500,000
barrels a day.
   She placed total OPEC September production as high as 21.9
million barrels a day.
   "We are seeing a steady rise for September," added Conrad
Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva, who also
tracks OPEC output. He estimated total September OPEC output
should be at least 21.5 million barrels a day, and said "it
could hit 22 million barrels a day for October." He
maintained, however, "that is the maximum."
   Whatever the September level, it will show a sharp rise
from last month. For August, according to the figures
released last week by the International Energy Agency, OPEC
production dropped to the year's low of 19.7 million barrels
a day from more than 23 million barrels a day in the
preceding months.
   The September increase will fall short of meeting demand
for OPEC oil, estimated by energy economists at around 23
million barrels a day for the remainder of the year. That
suggests pricing volatility and big draws of inventories --
or "stocks" -- even after the additional crude begins
reaching the Western oil-consuming nations.
   Oil prices, which have climbed nearly 50% since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, fell Friday on profit-taking. In U.S. futures
trading, October crude dropped $1.39 to $30.04 a barrel,
leaving it up $2.72 a barrel for the holiday-shortened week.
The biggest gain of the week, $1.66 a barrel on Thursday,
came the day after the weekly report of the American
Petroleum Institute. That report showed U.S. crude
inventories declined 4.4 million barrels the preceding week.
   World-wide inventory reductions averaged some 300,000
barrels a day last month, according to the Paris-based IEA,
the energy watchdog agency for the Western oil-consuming
nations. For September, IEA and industry officials anticipate
bigger withdrawals, probably as much as one million barrels a
day and reaching higher amounts as winter nears.
   "There could be something like a 2.1 million
{barrels-per-day} stock draw over the fourth quarter," said
Roger Benedict, an editor with Energy Information Ltd., which
provides analysis of oil industry news. "The real crunch
could be from November on," he added. "A lot depends on how
cold the winter is."
   Petroleum inventories were exceptionally high when the
Middle East crisis began. Supplies of petroleum products were
considered in balance; there was a glut of crude in onshore
storage and at sea. As late as Aug. 31, according to the
American Petroleum Institute, U.S. crude inventories still
stood at 372.2 million barrels, or 11% higher than the
year-earlier level of 335.8 million.
   Oil companies would like to avoid drawing down stocks
further because of the uncertainties, but won't have much
choice as demand peaks seasonally in the winter months.
   The losses in OPEC's August output weren't fully reflected
in world oil markets last month. That's because tankers
carrying oil from Iraq and Kuwait still were at sea long
after the embargo closed off all exports from those
countries. Although estimates vary, Iraq's output for last
month averaged nearly one million barrels a day. That was
one-third the 3.1 million barrels a day it produced in July.
Its September output is estimated at only about 400,000
barrels a day, or just enough for domestic use.
   The impact now is more evident. According to Roy Mason,
publisher of England-based Oil Afloat, there were some 440
million barrels of oil in tankers at sea on Aug. 5, three
days after the Mideast crisis began. By Aug. 20, according to
his latest estimate, oil at sea had been drained down to 370
million barrels.
   "It has taken this long to see the effect of the cutoff"
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, said Mr. Mason. As a result, before
volumes of oil at sea begin rebuilding, "it's almost
inevitable that onshore stocks {inventories} will start
falling."
