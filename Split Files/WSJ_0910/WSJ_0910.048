   Your Aug. 15 news story regarding King Hussein's
conference with President Bush contains the statement that
"King Hussein has come to rely on Iraq more and more for
protection from Israel." This notion that King Hussein
somehow has a legitimate fear of Israel has been repeated
several times in articles over the past several weeks. It is,
however, patently absurd. Israel has been the subject of
repeated unprovoked military attacks by Jordan. Jordan's
military and diplomatic hostility has been unceasing.
   If you reported that King Hussein stated that he believes
that he has something to fear from Israel, the reader could
then judge for himself. To report as a fact, however, that
King Hussein has something to fear from Israel is without
basis and constitutes irresponsible reporting.
