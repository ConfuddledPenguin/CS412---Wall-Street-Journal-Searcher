   HELSINKI, Finland -- President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev warned Saddam Hussein that they would
consider unspecified "additional" steps against Iraq if he
didn't heed United Nations demands to withdraw his army from
Kuwait.
   But at a news conference after issuing their toughly
worded joint statement, the two leaders revealed differences
in their approach to resolving the conflict that could
diminish the impact of their united stand, or raise hopes in
Baghdad of splitting the superpowers.

   In particular, the Soviet leader was far more reluctant
than President Bush to leave the impression that force might
be used against Iraq if diplomacy and economic pressure fail.
He made it clear the U.S.S.R. wouldn't join the growing land
and sea forces surrounding Iraq. And he stressed repeatedly
that the crisis could and must be resolved politically, even
though U.S. officials said a military strike at Iraq was
still an option.
   Despite these differences, the two presidents took pains
to stress the importance of their joint condemnation of Iraq.
Their statement declared that "nothing short of the complete
implementation of the United Nations Security Council
resolutions is acceptable. Nothing short of a return to the
pre-Aug. 2 status of Kuwait can end Iraq's isolation."
   The statement -- a show of unity that would have been
unthinkable only a year ago -- went on to warn Iraq that:
"Our preference is to resolve the crisis peacefully, and we
will be united against Iraq's aggression as long as the
crisis exists. However, we are determined to see this
aggression end, and if the current steps fail to end it, we
are prepared to consider additional ones consistent with the
U.N. charter."
   Both the U.S. and the Soviets officially heralded the
Helsinki meeting as a step forward in their newfound
cooperation that built on previous summits over the past year
in Malta and Washington. The united stand against Iraq, is "a
kind of solidarity which has never been expressed before in
the history of the world," Mr. Gorbachev said.
   "Differences still remain," Mr. Bush conceded. "But the
common ground, in my view at least, surges ahead of these
differences. And we will continue to cooperate with President
Gorbachev."
   Secretary of State James Baker told reporters that "we are
very, very pleased with this statement," stressing especially
the reference to additional steps consistent with the United
Nations charter, which he pointedly noted permits the use of
force.
   The additional steps threatened by the superpowers weren't
specified, and Secretary Baker said the two leaders didn't
discuss specifics on the subject. Mr. Baker himself, however,
said such steps could include additional sanctions on Iraq,
sanctions against countries that break the embargo, a
broadening of the current U.N. approval for the use of force
to stop goods moving into and out of the country, or the
invoking of the U.N. charter provision permitting countries
to defend themselves. Another U.S. official said action to
stop air shipments into Iraq might also be taken.
   "You might conclude from the press conference that the
Soviets are . . . not on board yet with the use of force,"
Mr. Baker conceded. "But the mere fact that we have a joint
statement that doesn't rule it out as an option . . . I think
moves the position even of the Soviet Union forward."
   Asked if Saddam Hussein might be encouraged by the Soviet
hesitation on the military threat, Mr. Baker asserted: "I
don't think he's going to take any joy in reading this
statement."
   Nonetheless, the two nations' positions weren't identical.
And the Soviet leader appeared to gain more than he conceded.
   After seven hours of talks, Mr. Bush came away without any
new Soviet contributions to the world-wide effort to isolate
Iraq. Mr. Gorbachev not only stuck forcefully to Moscow's
previous refusal to participate in the international military
force and naval blockade against Iraq, he even lectured Mr.
Bush on the need to stick to a non-military strategy to end
the crisis.
   "We may have a difference on that," the U.S. president
conceded. "President Gorbachev made an eloquent appeal, to
which I agree, that a peaceful solution is the best. So I've
left it open."
   One U.S. official, however, said that the U.S. went into
the meeting with a view that Mr. Gorbachev's internal
problems, including his large and restless Moslem population,
make it very difficult for him to appear too receptive to the
military option. And some U.S. officials had qualms about
inviting the Red Army and Navy into the Persian Gulf.
   Mr. Bush sought to ease one of the main Soviet worries by
assuring Mr. Gorbachev that large-scale U.S. forces won't
stay in Saudi Arabia beyond the end of the Gulf crisis. Mr.
Gorbachev, who has come under pressure from his own military
over this issue, described the pledge as "a very important
statement." He himself, however gave no assurance that the
Soviet Union would immediately withdraw its military advisers
from Iraq, as the U.S. wanted. Mr. Bush said the withdrawal
of all Soviet advisers would be helpful but that their
continued presence "is not a major irritant."
   In return for Soviet cooperation, Mr. Bush promised to
step up U.S. economic assistance to the Soviet Union, where
shortages of bread and other staples are growing more acute.
A U.S. business delegation led by Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher is due in Moscow this week and is expected to offer
technical advice in boosting Soviet oil output, among other
measures. But Mr. Bush acknowledged that U.S. budgetary
constraints meant that we can't "write out large checks."
   While welcoming the move, Mr. Gorbachev sought to head off
charges that the promise of aid had somehow influenced his
position on the Iraqi crisis. "It would be very
oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet
Union could be bought for dollars," he said. The remark was
only one of two brief moments from the news conference that
was broadcast on the Soviet evening television news.
   The joint statement contained a section on the status of
food imports under the embargo against Iraq that appeared to
soften the U.S. demand that humanitarian food aid couldn't be
considered unless there was starvation in Iraq. U.S.
officials, however, said the language was inserted at
American insistence in order to establish a procedure for a
U.N. decision on when food aid is justified and head off the
possibility that countries would try to break the embargo by
citing humanitarian concern. "I hope that nobody around the
world interprets this as our view that now there should be
wholesale food shipments to Iraq," President Bush said.
   At the news conference, Mr. Gorbachev disclosed that the
U.S. has dropped its long-standing position that the Soviet
Union shouldn't be involved in the Middle East. The Soviet
leader said that, "What was said here is that it's very
important for us to cooperate in the Middle East, just as it
is on other issues of world politics."
   But the two men appeared to be at odds over whether to
link resolution of the Kuwaiti crisis to other Mideast
problems, particularly the question of a Palestinian
homeland. Mr. Bush unequivocally ruled out linking the
Palestinian problem to Iraq, but Mr. Gorbachev contended, "It
seems to me that there is a link here because the failure to
find a solution in the Middle East at large also has a
bearing on the acuteness of the particular conflict we've
been talking about here."
   Although the Gulf crisis dominated the meeting, the two
leaders did discuss other issues such as arms control
agreements on strategic nuclear and conventional forces. The
two men reiterated that they hope both agreements will be
concluded soon and be ready for signing by year's end. But
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters
after the news conference that "we probably won't succeed
this year," in concluding a treaty on limiting strategic
arms.
