   Readers of this space are hardly surprised to see Lawrence
Walsh's Iran-Contra prosecutions crumble like castles in the
sand. He has now lost the two major cases to reach the
appeals court, with more legal defeats likely soon.
Independent counsel Walsh -- independent, that is, from
experienced prosecutors at the Justice Department -- has
become a multimillion-dollar legal disaster area.
   Mr. Walsh was especially busy last week. He asked the full
appeals court in Washington to review the appeals opinion
that seems likely to reverse all of Oliver North's
convictions. Mr. Walsh does not want to accept that he
violated the Constitution when he used evidence from Mr.
North's coerced testimony to Congress, despite the clear rule
that such evidence can't be used at trial. The same mistakes
probably will also reverse John Poindexter's conviction.

   Part of Mr. Walsh's enormous prosecuting team is in
Baltimore trying a former CIA official, Thomas Clines. This
case may also be headed for a fall. The charges against Mr.
Clines, an Iran-Contra middleman, have nothing to do with the
original allegations of supposedly illegal arms trades or the
diversion of money from the Iranians. Instead, Mr. Walsh
accuses him of failing to report all taxes owed on his covert
income.
   There are many problems with this case, including
precisely how are private contractors, asked by government
officials to play middlemen roles, supposed to account for
secret income on their tax returns. Taxes owed surely must be
paid, but Mr. Walsh's lead witness, Richard Secord, shocked
the proceedings when he said the prosecution case rests on
evidence that had somehow been falsified.
   What especially piqued our interest in this case, however,
was that Mr. Walsh brought it as a tax case. Federal criminal
tax cases are fewer than 1,500 a year. There is strict
oversight because of the real danger of selective tax
prosecution.
   Indeed, the Justice Department Guidelines for U.S.
Attorneys requires prosecutors to get prior approval for any
criminal tax case from the tax division of Justice. U.S.
Attorneys Manual Section 6-4.122 says even independent
counsel must not bring an indictment "without specific prior
authorization of the Tax Division."
   Did Mr. Walsh get approval from Justice before indicting
Mr. Clines? When we asked, Mr. Walsh's press spokesperson
refused to comment. Justice spokesmen, however, say that Mr.
Walsh did not consult the department before bringing any of
the Iran-Contra cases. In other words, Mr. Walsh apparently
did not follow Justice rules before charging Mr. Clines. This
could be a ground for an appeal from any conviction.
   This was not the first time Mr. Walsh ignored Justice
guidelines that apply even to independent counsel. Last week
he got confirmation from a federal appeals court that his
case against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez was an abuse
from day one.
   He indicted Mr. Fernandez, the former agency chief in
Costa Rica, for giving misleading statements about his role
in Iran-Contra. The supposed misstatements about who did what
to help the Contras were not under oath or part of any
transcript, but Mr. Walsh had an even bigger problem. To show
that his statements were true, Mr. Fernandez needed to cite
some 100,000 classified documents.
   Mr. Walsh ignored the Justice Department rule that
prosecutors considering indictments in cases involving
classified material must first consult with the intelligence
agencies. Instead, Mr. Walsh brought the indictment, then
when intelligence officials screamed about the sources and
methods that would leak if there was a trial, he dismissed
this as "fictional secrets" and "artificial deniability."
   Mr. Walsh, no national-security expert, was wrong. Trial
Judge Claude Hilton agreed with a classified filing by three
top intelligence officials who warned of "exceptionally grave
damage" if these secrets got out. Last week a unanimous
appeals court agreed that there can be no trial. The detailed
opinion by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson itself was full of
asterisks marking sensitive material, as in "although the
program and the `may not have been as closely tied as ,' they
were still relevant to the charges against Fernandez and thus
were admissible."
   The criminalization of policy differences known as
Iran-Contra has been a flop. President Reagan was not
impeached, Nicaragua is inching toward freedom and Iran
remains in the feudal era. At home, we have learned that
institutional pressures on congressionally created
independent counsel have forced many of them to push the
outer envelope of prosecutorial behavior. Mr. Walsh has left
no doubt that his targets were prosecuted to the extent the
law allows, and as we now know even beyond.
   Enough is enough. There is a long rap sheet against Mr.
Walsh: He violated immunity rules in the North and Poindexter
cases; violated tax rules in the Clines case; violated
classified information rules in the Fernandez case. How much
more evidence does President Bush need before deciding it's
time to thank him for his services and send Mr. Walsh home?
