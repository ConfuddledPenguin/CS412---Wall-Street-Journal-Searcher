   Perhaps the most pernicious myth thwarting progress in
education today is the shibboleth that "Technology will never
replace the classroom teacher." The truth: It already has.
   I recently witnessed a demonstration of a computer program
that can teach any student of any age to read English up to
any level of proficiency -- without the aid of a human
teacher. The product, to be marketed next year by a
California company, Periscope Software, was pilot tested in
public schools and produced reading gains far superior to
conventional classes.

   This is an exciting but not unique example. Two decades of
research show that computer-based instruction produces at
least 30% more learning in 40% less time at 30% less cost
compared to traditional classroom teaching. Other research
demonstrated 125 technologies and methods that proved to at
least double the productivity of teaching -- yielding at
least twice as much learning for each unit of labor, cost, or
time.
   These tools -- as well as the VCR, television, and even
the telephone -- are almost totally unused in U.S. schools
and colleges. The cost to the U.S. economy of academia's
successful resistance to technological innovation is at least
$100 billion a year. The country simply can no longer afford
this kind of waste. A technological revolution now is totally
transforming the role of learning and teaching in the modern
economy. As a result, the "Yak in the Box" model of
instructional technology -- the 1,000-year-old lecturing
classroom professor -- will have as much place in the 21st
century's learning enterprise as the blacksmith shop has in
today's transportation system.
   There is nothing the education establishment can do to
stop this revolution, except on its own turf -- it's
happening everywhere outside the schools. For instance,
corporate education departments are spending at least 300
times more on computer-based instruction than public schools
are, as a share of their total budgets. Companies like Unisys
and IBM are restructuring employee education programs to
replace the great bulk of classroom teaching with instruction
delivered by computers and telecommunications -- to achieve
better results at less cost.
   Classrooms and teachers are far too costly and slow to
meet the Information Age's exploding demand for learning.
Increasingly learning is built into both production systems
and consumer products. For example, in the past decade the
U.S. went from having nearly no personal computers to having
some 45 million PCs in use, which means that some 60 million
people learned how to use PCs. We know that almost none of
this economically and socially crucial learning took place in
schools. It was "delivered" by vendors, manuals, tutorial
software, videos, telephone hot lines, user groups, books,
magazines, electronic bulletin boards, built-in "help"
systems, much trial-and-error and a great deal of schmoozing.
And many parents and teachers will testify that kids often
led adults in climbing up the PC learning curve.
   Many business leaders are eager to see education embrace
leading-edge technology. But few seem to recognize that, in
the absence of wide-open choice and competition, the
school-of-the-future and the classroom-of-tomorrow will
continue to be the meretricious hoaxes they always have been.
On the other hand, restructuring advocates inside and outside
the school system who rightly see "choice" as the key to
educational "perestroika" often don't seem to realize that
technology is essential to the success of such a policy. For
teachers to become the high-tech professionals they need and
increasingly want to be, the agendas of technology and choice
need to be melded into a single platform for change.
   U.S. public schools and colleges are technologically stuck
in the Middle Ages for the same reason Soviet collective
farms are: a complete lack of accountability to the consumer
and total insulation from competitive, market forces.
Central, bureaucratic, "command" management provides no
incentive -- and a thicket of discouragements -- for
productivity, and hence for innovation. Russian grocery
stores are not barren because Soviet farmers are ignorant of
the potential of hybrid seed, fertilizers, and so forth to
increase food production. It just doesn't pay any better for
the collective farmer to grow corn than just to grow old.
   American teachers and schools are trapped in the same
political quagmire. A friend of mine tried to sell a
marvelous interactive video system for building the basic
skills of sub-literate adults to the adult-education division
of a major urban public school district. He argued that the
system would virtually pay for itself by increasing
productivity at least 30% -- students could get through the
curriculum with better achievement about a third faster. "You
don't understand," the division director said. "The district
pays us for attendance, not achievement. There's no reward
for getting students through here faster; if anything, my ADA
{average daily attendance} might go down and my budget could
get cut."
   Similarly, when I did a study a couple of years ago for
one of the country's most affluent school districts to find
out why the vast majority of teachers had shown no interest
in participating in a multimillion-dollar program aimed at
expanding computer-based instruction, one teacher I
interviewed could have spoken for thousands when she said:
"Why should I do anything different next year from what I did
last year? Who cares?" Changing to new ways of teaching takes
time, effort, risk and money. The bureaucracy was offering
nothing even to cover these costs to her, much less any
reward for success.
   Only when schools have to earn their revenues in the
marketplace by competing to serve consumers who are free to
choose where to take their business (and money) will schools
and teachers have the incentive to adopt productive
technologies. And only when schools are free to operate as
autonomous enterprises -- with true "school-based management"
-- will educators have the opportunity to use their own
resources to acquire the technologies they judge to work
best.
   The latter point is often overlooked. We need choice and
competition in education not only to goad technical
innovation but to provide quality control. The market is the
essential solution to the "one best system" fallacy that has
yielded, among other disasters, the dumbing down of the
school textbook to perfect idiocy.
   Also overlooked is how crucial technology is to the
success of the policy called "choice" -- which, to work
effectively, must include the freedom for teachers to choose
how to design and run their schools as well as the freedom
for students to choose what schools and programs to attend.
Technology blows away many of the key objections to choice
programs: That "choice" is phony when all schools are
essentially the same. That successful schools will be filled
up and leave many students stuck in bad schools. That
distance and geography limit actual choices.
   First, computer-based, multimedia and other advanced
technologies now provide not only great diversity in
instructional designs, but enable us to custom-make programs
to meet each student's individual needs, abilities and goals.
So "sameness" is obsolete.
   Moreover, "distance learning" -- the use of
telecommunications to deliver instruction from anyone,
anywhere to anyone, anywhere -- virtually eradicates spatial
barriers to choice. Once we recognize that "school" is a
process not a building, it's clear that we can now deliver as
many different schools as cable TV channels, to wherever
there is an adequate terminal. In the U.S., that's just about
everywhere. Every student can have access to the best
teachers and instruction available in every subject. Distance
learning can liberate minorities from the knowledge ghetto.
   Techno-choice is an essential strategy to save education
from economic irrelevancy -- and the American workforce from
disastrous impoverishment. But it requires wholesale
replacement of lecturers and classrooms with silicon chips
and glass threads.
   The obsolescence of the job of "classroom teacher" need
not be a threat to the people who now hold that position.
They won't be thrown on the scrapheap or sent to the glue
factory. Indeed, the learning revolution is opening a golden
age for professional educators who are truly dedicated to
serving the consumer. But "more of the same" is not an
option. Teachers now must decide what role they will play in
this revolution: vanguard or victim, leader or Luddite.
