   KIMITSU, Japan -- Add energy conservation to the
proliferating measures of Japanese superiority.
   Perched atop a 12-story cooling tank at this sprawling
seaside steelworks, Takeo Harada waxes rhapsodic about his
favorite topic: saving energy.

   "In Japan, we love spending money on contraptions like
this," shouts the 30-year-old engineer, gesturing proudly at
a tangle of pipes and turbines. The object of his affection
is a "coke dry quencher," a $5.6 million apparatus that
helped his company, Nippon Steel Corp., slash the energy
required to produce a ton of steel nearly 25%. At a plant
using 1% of the energy consumed in Japan -- enough to power a
city of two million -- such savings matter.
   Like most Japanese manufacturers, Nippon Steel pursues
energy conservation with near-religious devotion. The
enthusiasm at the Kimitsu plant goes a long way toward
explaining why this resource-poor country has the world's
most fuel-efficient economy -- and why Japan is the
industrialized nation least likely to be knocked for a loop
by a short-term surge in oil prices stemming from the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   No country was harder hit than Japan by the oil shocks of
1973 and 1979. And no country subsequently insulated itself
better from the vagaries of world oil markets. Some experts
contend that if the rest of the industrialized world had
worked equally hard over the past decade to reduce dependence
on foreign oil, the U.S. might not have found it necessary to
send troops to the Mideast and the global economy might not
face such a recession threat.
   How did Japan get so energy-efficient? Can the rest of the
world learn from it?
   "The lessons for America are so simple they're almost
banal," says Richard Samuels, a specialist on Japanese energy
policy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Oil is a
nonrenewable resource. It's possible to reduce consumption,
but first you have to decide you really want to."
   Japan really wanted to. But will alone wasn't enough. The
production engineers at the Kimitsu Steel Works and thousands
of other Japanese factories didn't collectively decide, in
reaction to enormous popular pressure, to push energy
conservation. Instead, the government spurred their
enthusiasm through a carefully coordinated, long-range
program that continues even today. One clear lesson to learn
from Japan is that forcing core industries to become more
energy-efficient is one thing that government can do well.
   A second lesson is that government has a hard time forcing
individuals to be energy-efficient. Not that Japan didn't
try. During the 1979 oil crisis, then-Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira tried to set an example by arriving at a
cabinet meeting sporting a tacky short-sleeved suit coat; if
others would adopt the "safari look," he said, the country
could stop wasting energy on air conditioning. The safari
look didn't catch on.
   Japanese consumers aren't helping much to save energy
today, either. Now wealthier, they are demanding more
appliances; Japanese households have, on the average, two TV
sets, a refrigerator and an air conditioner. On weekends,
Tokyo's expressways are jammed with vacationers creeping
toward the beaches in big, gas-thirsty 4x4s. Ice-cold air
floods from the doors of department stores to the sweltering
sidewalks in Ginza, the Tokyo retailing district. Neon signs
of cabarets, bars and pachinko parlors glitter all night.
   This relative complacency was spawned in part by several
years of cheap oil, and Japan's energy demand has grown 5% in
each of the past three years. Japanese industrial companies,
however, have continued to become more energy-efficient, so
much so that some see little room for improvement if further
efforts are needed.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. switched to nuclear power and
slashed its dependence on oil by two-thirds. Asahi Glass Co.
rebuilt its kilns and modified production processes to cut
energy use 40% in a decade. A municipal train system in
northern Japan recycles heat generated by its engines to run
air conditioning. Japanese plant equipment, generally newer
and more efficient than that in U.S. factories, increases
Japan's relative energy efficiency.
   Yet 20 years ago, even before the 1973 oil embargo,
Japan's economy was the world's most energy-efficient; it
consumed less than two-thirds as much energy, after
adjustment for differences in economic size, as did the U.S.
In part, Japan's lower consumption was, and is, attributable
to its geographical compactness, population density and
superb public transportation.
   Since then, all the major industrialized countries have
improved energy-efficiency by roughly a quarter. But Japan
has improved by a third, even though it was already more
efficient and additional gains were more difficult. Moreover,
Japan, unlike other countries, has focused on reducing its
dependence on oil, almost all of which must be imported.
Between the 1973 oil crisis and 1987, Japan's economic output
more than doubled, yet its oil imports fell 25%. (U.S.
reliance on foreign oil during the same period actually
increased, from 36% to 43% of total oil usage.)
   And Japan has diversified its oil suppliers. In 1973, it
imported nearly two-thirds of its oil from four countries in
the politically volatile Mideast -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. By the end of the 1980s,
Japan had doubled the number of its main Mideast oil
suppliers. Until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Tokyo carefully
maintained close diplomatic ties to most Persian Gulf
nations; during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war, Japanese aid
flowed to both sides -- and oil flowed from both to Japan. In
addition, Japan is buying more and more oil from other
producers, such as China.
   But what really sets Japan apart from other oil-consuming
countries is its patient pursuit of energy conservation and
diversification throughout the 1980s, even after oil prices
plunged. The U.S., more sensitive to market signals, didn't.
The contrast is a classic illustration of what Ronald Morse,
an energy specialist at the Economic Strategy Institute in
Washington, calls the two countries' "different philosophies"
about conserving energy.
   "The Japanese are doing what we started during the Carter
administration. The difference is just that they continued
what we abandoned," Mr. Morse says. "Japan is concerned about
economic vulnerability; so, it tries to insulate itself from
injury from other nations." He adds:
   "In the U.S., the whole thrust has been to deregulate and
to keep the price of energy cheap. But that means that
sometimes we have to use military might to keep the sources
of cheap energy open."
   With peace-minded Japan ruling out military intervention,
the country emphasizes conservation. And those efforts begin
where it matters most -- in manufacturing, which consumes
half of Japan's energy.
   This concentration plays to a crucial Japanese strength:
bureaucratic management of industry. Mr. Morse credits
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry for much
of its success in conserving energy. "This is one area where
you can say that the controls the Japanese government has
over the market really worked," he says.
   MITI's energy controls are characteristically thorough.
Since the 1979 oil shock, MITI officials have kept close
watch on the energy consumption of 5,000 factories.
Designated factories have to appoint from one to as many as
10 energy-conservation engineers to monitor fuel efficiency
on the shop floor. Before the engineers can start work, they
must pass an examination so strict that most of them spend
more than a year preparing for it -- and even then eight out
of 10 flunk. Those who pass keep daily tabs on their
factory's energy use and regularly report on progress to
MITI. Failing to meet targets incurs no sanctions, but the
fear of antagonizing MITI's powerful bureaucrats ensures
cooperation.
   MITI also openly urged companies to rely less on oil and
more on coal and natural gas -- both obtainable in
politically stable nations. Nippon Steel's Kimitsu plant, for
example, converted its blast furnaces to coal in the early
1980s and slashed oil's share of its energy supply to almost
zero from about 20%. Further savings were achieved from the
coke dry quencher, which recycles hot gas that used to escape
as molten iron ore cooled.
   Moreover, MITI lets Japanese energy suppliers, including
oil and gas companies and electric utilities, keep their
prices -- and profits -- high, provided the windfalls are
channeled into energy research. That amounts to an energy
tax, some say, but the artificially high cost of petroleum
products hastens the transition to new energy sources. In
1987, MITI funneled more than 117 billion yen ($830 million)
of such profits into energy research -- more than to all
other ministry projects combined -- and that doesn't count
the billions MITI forced utilities to spend on similar
projects.
   As a result, Japan now has the world's best technology for
solar cells, storage and transport of liquid natural gas, and
generators producing electricity from gasified coal and sea
water. "Sure, a lot of this research is risky," Mr. Morse
concedes. But, he adds, "relatively speaking, the projects
didn't cost all that much, and probably at least 60% of them
have been effective. And now that investment's paying off."
   Even nuclear power has helped, despite often-emotional
opposition in the only country to suffer from nuclear
weapons. Before the first oil shock, Japan had virtually no
nuclear-power capacity; today, it has 38 operating nuclear
facilities, which supply about 9% of its total energy. The
government wants to nearly double that by the end of the
decade. Thanks to the government push to rely more on coal,
natural gas and nuclear power, oil's share of Japan's total
energy demand fell to about 56.9% from 77.4% between 1973 and
1987.
   Not all of Japan's energy management has been orchestrated
by bureaucrats. Once the program was under way, even
companies whose factories weren't supervised discovered that
less dependence on energy meant less vulnerability to oil
shocks and price surges.
   At Hino Motors Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of medium and
heavy trucks, the results were stunning. Switches were added
to machine tools so they wouldn't idle when not in use.
Machining oil was recycled. Heat-treatment rooms were
insulated. Shop lighting and air conditioning were reduced.
The upshot after a year: a 10% to 15% energy saving.
   Japan has benefited, too, from industrial modernization.
Since the late 1970s, the country has shifted from heavy
manufacturing to cleaner, more fuel-efficient industries such
as consumer electronics and financial services. That
restructuring -- Japanese pundits describe it as the change
from a ju-ko-cho-dai (heavy, thick, long, big) to a
kei-haku-tansho (light, thin, short, small) economy -- was
under way before the oil shocks; high energy prices merely
accelerated it.
   By 1985, for example, Japan's aluminum-smelting industry
had all but disappeared -- only a single smelter is still
working in Japan -- because it couldn't compete with
hydroelectric-powered smelters in Canada, the U.S. and
Brazil. Some manufacturers are taking advantage of those
cheaper energy sources by moving production closer to them.
Oji Paper Co. cut its energy costs almost 60% by shifting
some paper-making operations to Canada.
   However, keeping energy-conservation gains already
achieved isn't easy. At Hino Motors, executives say energy
use is rising again because tight labor conditions are
forcing its factories to rely more heavily on machinery.
   With the Iraqi invasion, the government has had a fresh
reason to promote conservation. Hallways in government office
buildings are dark again, and government offices are
uncomfortably warm. MITI has asked drivers not to go faster
than 50 miles an hour and to keep their air conditioning at
28 degrees Celsius.
   However, many energy experts here admit to doubting that
such symbolic measures have much effect on consumption
nationwide. "We all think we're rich now," says Kenji Mogami,
a MITI official. "It's difficult to get people who think
they're rich to make sacrifices."
   And it's more difficult to get people who already have
made sacrifices to bite the bullet even harder. At Sumitomo
Chemical Co., stringent measures cut energy consumption
sharply in an industry in which most products require oil to
produce; today, the company relies on petroleum for only half
its products.
   "We and the Japanese petrochemical industry as a whole did
a great deal to rationalize our process already," complains
Shoji Morimoto, an executive vice president at Sumitomo
Chemical.
   Thus, Japan may not be able to keep improving its energy
conservation. "We will have more difficulty in the future,"
says Shijuro Ogata, deputy governor of the government-run
Japan Development Bank. "There is much less room for Japan to
conserve further."
