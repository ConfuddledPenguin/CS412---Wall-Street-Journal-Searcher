   ROME -- A serious split developed among European Community
countries about the speed and method for achieving monetary
union, raising the likelihood of increasingly difficult
negotiations among EC members later this year.
   At an informal meeting of the 12 finance ministers here
Saturday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major won
unexpected support for a more cautious approach to monetary
union. The British plan emphasizes the need for convergence
among the various economies of the EC -- reducing wide gaps
in inflation rates, budget deficits, unemployment and other
economic indicators -- before moving toward full economic and
monetary union.

   At the meeting, which was set up to lay the groundwork for
a round of monetary-union talks in December, Mr. Major won
backing from Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the
community's smaller economies, which are worried that they
could be severely damaged if monetary union is put in place
before the yawning gap between rich and poor EC nations is
narrowed.
   EC President Jacques Delors said he was disappointed that
Spain, in a surprise move, decided to break ranks with
countries such as France and Italy, which are pressing for a
speedy monetary union. Despite the setback, Mr. Delors said
the overall movement toward a single currency "has been
maintained."
   Nevertheless, it is clear that the latest developments
could slow the monetary-union momentum -- and rhetoric --
that had been building in recent months. France, Belgium,
Italy and the EC Commission itself had spoken of moving
toward the second stage of the Delors plan by Jan. 1, 1993,
and toward creation of a single currency within as little as
five years. Under the British plan, and even under a
compromise proposal by Spain, the likelihood of a single
currency's being established before the end of the century
would be small.
   "It's not going to be a mad race" toward monetary union,
Albert Reynolds, the Irish finance minister, said. "Once you
put a date on {monetary union}, people will begin to stand
back for various reasons."
   France, Belgium and Italy wanted to set Jan. 1, 1993, for
the entry into force of the transitory stage of monetary
union. But Mr. Major argued that those countries were
concentrating too heavily on setting arbitrary dates and not
enough on the economic practicalities that would be
encountered by weaker economies in a monetary union. "Unless
we get that convergence," he said, "we are going to get
enormous tensions and enormous costs within different parts
of the community."
