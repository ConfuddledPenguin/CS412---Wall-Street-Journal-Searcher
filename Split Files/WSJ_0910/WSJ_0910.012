   Chancellor Helmut Kohl once told us that getting Soviet
troops to leave East Germany may prove to be more of a
problem for the Soviet Union than for Germany. A two-day
protest demonstration last week by wives of Russian soldiers
billeted near Burg supports his point.
   The wives weren't complaining about what some Soviet
generals have termed the "loss of Germany." Rather, they had
heard about their prospects when the 200th Motorized Rifle
Regiment motors back home to Russia, and they don't like
them. Garrison life in East Germany isn't great but it is
better than what they face.

   Some returning Red Army units are living in tent cities
while they build new housing for themselves and their
families. Something like that is planned for the 200th. The
Russian winter is coming on. The wives are demanding to know
where their children will be educated and how other amenities
will be supplied. What with food shortages, things are bad
enough these days even for Russians who have homes and
schools.
   Stories of Soviet soldiers trying to avoid repatriation
are floating around Germany. Some are offering to sell
uniforms or even weapons to raise Deutsche marks. A Radio
Free Europe source in Munich reports a fairly constant flow
of Soviets showing up to ask advice on how to defect. With
the East-West barriers down and Deutsche marks in their
pockets, the soldiers have little to stop them from making
such contacts other than disapproving officers. But obviously
the officers aren't happy either.
   There are ample historical precedents for conquering
armies developing a preference for the conquered nation over
a return to the homeland. Many Russians draw their lineage
from conquering tribes from the Nordic lands or from the
East. Conquest often means that the homeland falls into
neglect. Something like that has happened in the Soviet
empire.
   While Chancellor Kohl correctly says that troop
repatriation presents more problems for Mr. Gorbachev than
for Germany, it will be expensive for Germany. A German
official last week said that his country has agreed to build
apartments for Russian soldiers returning home from Germany.
But the Germans think the price tag the Russians are putting
on the project -- 10 billion Deutsche marks or $6.5 billion
-- is much too high. The Russians also are demanding that all
U.S., British and French troops leave West Berlin when the
Soviet troops have been fully withdrawn. That is stalling
final acknowledgment of German reunification.
   Bargaining is what diplomats do. But the Russian wives,
quite rightly, want to know when someone actually is going to
start building a house.
