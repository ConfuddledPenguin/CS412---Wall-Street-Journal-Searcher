   Mitsubishi Electric Corp. plans to double production
capacity of car phones at its Atlanta, Ga., plant to 400,000
units in fiscal 1991 to meet growing U.S. demand, a company
spokesman said.
   The Tokyo company aims to maintain its share of roughly
10% of the U.S. market by expanding the line at the plant.
The products are part of the newest car phone systems, which
transmit voices digitally.
