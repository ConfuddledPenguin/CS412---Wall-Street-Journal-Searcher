   NEW YORK -- John V. Giovenco, Hilton Hotels Corp.'s head
of gambling operations, sold his entire stake in the company
late last month at a $237,867 loss, Securities and Exchange
Commission filings show.
   The shares of the Beverly Hills, Calif., hotel and gaming
giant have plummeted this year as takeover hopes evaporated
and second-quarter earnings came in below expectations --
chiefly because of a sharp drop in the gambling operations
that Mr. Giovenco oversees.

   The executive's stock sale comes at a time when a
recession-skittish Wall Street has soured on gaming stocks in
general and Hilton shares in particular. Mr. Giovenco's
20,000 shares fetched an average of $35.50. That was down
from the average of $47.39 he paid for them in September and
October of 1988, and way below the stock's 12-month high of
$110.25, hit when Hilton was actively seeking merger
partners.
   Mr. Giovenco said he sold for personal reasons, but didn't
elaborate. Cheryl Marsh, an attorney for the company, said,
"We do not comment on any of the insider trading." When Mr.
Giovenco sold his Hilton shares on Aug. 22, his total
proceeds were about $710,000; he had spent about $948,000 to
buy the stock.
   Right now, Hilton is facing intense competition from other
casinos, a potential decline in traffic if a recession
occurs, and the problems of a generally overbuilt hotel
industry, said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Back in September 1988, Mr. Giovenco's purchase of Hilton
stock looked prescient. The day after he bought 10,000 shares
Sept. 21, the stock rose $1.50 on takeover rumors. But the
company announced this past April that it was taking itself
off the market, news that triggered the start of the stock's
steep decline. Right about that time, Financial Programs
Inc., a Denver mutual fund company, sold its $50 million
stake in Hilton because "it did not meet our expectations,"
said a Financial Programs spokesman.
   More recently, Hilton stock has fallen on the company's
July 10 report of second-quarter earnings. Hilton's operating
profit from casinos dropped 21% to $29 million. Gaming now
accounts for more than half of Hilton's earnings, and overall
company earnings fell to 79 cents a share from 89 cents a
year earlier. The stock initially fell $1.50 on the earnings
news to $51.50, and has continued a downward trend.
   Most surprising to Wall Street was Hilton's disclosure
that gambling was down at its flagship Las Vegas Hilton in
the quarter. Circus Circus's new Excalibur casino and Golden
Nugget's Mirage casino have lured away both walk-in traffic
and some high rollers from the Vegas Hilton, analysts and
portfolio managers said.
   Following the disclosure of the quarterly results,
Wertheim &amp; Co. removed the stock from its recommended list,
and Mr. Doyle of Smith Barney downgraded the stock from a
"sell" recommendation to an "avoid." The stock has fallen so
much that the Smith Barney recommendation was just changed
again, to a "hold," Mr. Doyle said. "But the outlook is
clouded and the Street continues to lower earnings
estimates," he added.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Hilton closed at $34, up 12.5 cents.
