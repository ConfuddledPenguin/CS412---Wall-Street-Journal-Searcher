   Mr. Flanagan, who reports to Peter R. Kann, president of
Dow Jones and the Journal's publisher, will also serve as
chairman of the corporate marketing steering committee, which
coordinates marketing issues. "We'll be looking to Bernie to
originate marketing ideas, like the Journal's subregional
editions, which he pioneered," said Mr. Kann.
   In his new post, Mr. Flanagan will advise Dow Jones
executives on advertising and marketing strategies. He will
also be responsible for developing marketing initiatives and
ad campaigns, and for selling partnerships and packages that
cut across traditional publication and group lines.
   Paul Atkinson, 37, currently advertising sales director
for the Journal, was named the paper's vice president for
advertising, reporting to Kenneth L. Burenga, general manager
of the Journal. Robert D. Higgins, 60, director of
advertising services for Dow Jones, was named to the
additional post of director of advertising administration for
the Journal. Mr. Higgins will also be Mr. Atkinson's deputy.
   James Friedlich, 33, currently circulation director for
The Wall Street Journal/Europe, will become director of
international sales and marketing for Dow Jones Publications.
In his new post, Mr. Friedlich, who will report to Karen
Elliott House, vice president of Dow Jones's international
group, will be responsible for providing global sales and
marketing direction for the overseas editions of the Journal
and other Dow Jones publications based overseas.
   In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones
publishes Barron's magazine and other business periodicals
and the Ottaway group of community newspapers. The company
also supplies electronic business information services, and
through its Telerate subsidiary provides computerized
financial information world-wide.
