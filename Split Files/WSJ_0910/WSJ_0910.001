   SALT LAKE CITY -- John Johnson has managed to transform
his passion for rock into a company on a roll.
   Mr. Johnson is co-founder and president of DOD Electronics
Corp., a rock 'n' roll gadget maker that produces "signal
processors," devices controlled by microchips that
electronically alter sounds. They provide, for example, the
buzz-saw bite that allows heavy-metal guitarists to assault
the ears of America's youth.

   DOD's products, marketed notably under the Digitech label,
have been so successful that the company is leading another
assault as well: It heads a pack of U.S. upstarts reclaiming
a niche of the consumer electronics market that seemed
forever lost to large Japanese rivals such as Yamaha Corp.
and Roland Corp.
   Recent trade magazine surveys show that as many as five of
the 10 best-selling guitar signal processors, known as guitar
pedals, were made by U.S. companies (four of them by DOD),
while eight of the 10 top-selling multi-effects processors
were made in the U.S. (two of them by DOD). Five years ago,
the Japanese virtually owned the guitar-pedal business, and
the market didn't exist for multi-effects processors,
stereo-sized units capable of blending several sound effects
at once.
   DOD's successful counteroffensive against the Japanese
manufacturing juggernaut makes it a rare beast among small
U.S. companies. Others that have succeeded, such as Micron
Technology Inc., a semiconductor maker, and Harley Davidson
Inc., the motorcycle manufacturer, have had help from Uncle
Sam.
   DOD has slugged its way to the top alone, boosting its
sales tenfold to about $30 million in the past five years and
grabbing about 10% of the $300 million music
signal-processing market. Another company going it alone is
Go-Video Inc., a maker of dual-deck videocassette recorders
that's suing five Japanese electronics companies in federal
court in Phoenix, Ariz., on charges that they conspired to
block marketing of its machines.
   DOD's methods are instructive for others venturing into
treacherous waters. Rather than "turning Japanese," DOD seems
to have capitalized on the old-fashioned American virtue of
innovation, combined with a business-school approach and a
willingness to learn from the competition. The result: a
rapid stream of low-cost, high-quality products that have set
the pace in a market so fickle that product life is sometimes
measured in months.
   DOD's line of gadgets, which sell from $59 to $800,
typically cost 30% less than Japanese competitors. They're
cheap enough for garage-band muscians, and they're also
popping up in high places. Keyboard players for Michael
Jackson use Digitech signal processors, while the metal band
White Snake gets its crunchy sounds with DOD guitar pedals
that allow "programmable distortion."
   "There is no doubt that they have come up with some very
clever products," says Tom Beckmen, president of Roland's
U.S. marketer and distributor. For products in the $400 to
$500 range, "they are currently the significant supplier." By
some industry estimates, DOD already may have overtaken
Roland and its Boss label as the No. 1 seller of guitar
pedals, a niche of the market Roland once easily controlled.
   Music retailers say that orders for the Digitech DSP-21, a
device introduced in January that allows guitar players to
blend as many as ten effects at once, are so crisp that it
seems certain to become the industry's top-selling
multi-effects processor this year. Overall, DOD's line has
expanded to 120 products, a 45% increase in the last four
years alone.
   This string of recent successes may be why DOD attracted
the attention in March of Harman International Industries
Inc., the Washington, D.C., music-equipment giant. Harman
acquired DOD from Mr. Johnson and other investors but plans
to operate it as a "completely autonomous" subsidiary, with
Mr. Johnson and DOD's management intact, a Harman spokesman
said. Harman, which already owns several loud speaker labels,
including JBL and Infinity, won't say what it paid for DOD,
but its investment reflects "an admiration for a company that
has done very well in carving out a strong niche," says
Bernard Girod, a Harman executive vice president.
   Indeed, the company's success seems both a credit to the
42-year-old Mr. Johnson's aggressive creativity and to his
view of rock sound-effects equipment as a native art form. "I
doubt if either of the presidents of Yamaha or Roland back in
Japan started their companies because they sat listening to
the sound on the opening guitar chord of (The Beatles') `A
Hard Day's Night' and wondering, `How did they do that?'" he
says. Mr. Johnson, himself a guitarist, co-founded DOD in
1974, when he was unable to find commercially available
equipment that would allow him to emulate rock studio sounds.
   DOD has stayed close to its roots: In a company with 285
employees, there are 19 bands -- 20 if you count the company
band in which Mr. Johnson sometimes performs. Managers put up
with posters of heavy-metal bands on the walls of DOD's
testing department and even impromptu jam sessions by
guitar-playing technicians.
   But while corporate attire may be jeans and sneakers, DOD
has brought in marketing and accounting MBAs, who happen to
be guitar players, to run sales and business offices. It also
has mimicked the Japanese zeal for quality, boasting a return
rate on products of less than half of 1%.
   "It's an innovative company that backs its products
completely," says Don Kelsey, the northern California manager
for Guitar Center, a high-volume music store chain in which
DOD products must vie aggressively for space with those made
by Roland, Yamaha and others.
   The U.S. signal processing industry could easily have gone
the route of the nation's television manufacturing industry.
A cluster of small U.S. companies created and dominated the
market through the 1960s. In the 1970s, the Japanese invaded
in force with efficient manufacturing and shrewd marketing,
deluging consumers with high-quality products at cheap
prices. DOD was among a few U.S. firms to hang on, plodding
along with what Mr. Johnson calls "a lot of `me too' kind of
stuff."
   In the early 1980s, U.S. survivors like DOD began to sense
opportunity from two converging factors, the price advantages
offered by the escalating value of yen against the dollar and
the marriage of digital audio-recording technology to
high-powered chips to create a new generation of "smart"
signal processors capable of generating a wealth of sound
effects. A key aspect of the new devices is the software that
runs them, "and software development tends to be an American
strength," says Tom Mulhern, technology editor for Guitar
Player, a trade magazine.
   DOD began its successful offensive against the Japanese in
1982, after Mr. Johnson woke up one morning and decided,
"We've got too many musicians in this company not to become a
leader." While the Japanese typically had counted on
high-volume discount chains to move their merchandise, Mr.
Johnson courted the chains and also induced numerous
mom-and-pop music stores into the fold with fatter markups
and product warranties that the Japanese weren't offering. He
used independent sales representatives to sign up retailers,
paying annual commissions reportedly as high as $150,000.
Today, DOD's 2,200-store network of dealers is among the
nation's largest.
   At the same time, Mr. Johnson boosted DOD's engineering
staff from one to 10 -- most of them musicians -- and brought
in two sophisticated robotic-inserting machines to cut labor
costs while speeding up circuit board production. Moreover,
the company recently added computer-aided-design stations to
handle the customizing of the computer chips that power its
signal processors. The result: The tedious work of
programming computer chips with the complex series of
algorithms that digitally create sound effects can now be
done in a matter of days, instead of months.
   Despite DOD's effective moves, the Japanese aren't going
away, and nobody knows that better than John Johnson. The
Harman investment, indeed, will provide DOD with some
additional manufacturing expertise and capital that Mr.
Johnson thinks will be necessary for his goal, which he only
half-jokingly describes as "total market domination."
