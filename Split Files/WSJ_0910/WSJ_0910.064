   WASHINGTON -- Partisan opponents in the savings-and-loan
blamefest agree on at least two things: The thrift looters
belong in prison, and it is the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that should put them there.
   Congressional Democrats attack the administration for
failing to unleash the FBI in the S&amp;L scandal. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh counters that G-men are on the trail
in every "major" thrift fraud case.

   Before the Iraqi situation overshadowed other issues here,
Democrats and Republicans were engaged in a Capitol Hill
bidding war over how many new FBI agents should be hired to
track "crime in the suites."
   For all the sound and fury, politicians are actually using
the FBI in a subtle public-relations campaign that has
historical roots dating as far back as 1919. The message,
intended to reassure voters, is that a forbiddingly
complicated problem -- the possible collapse of the thrift
industry -- is really a simple matter of cops and robbers.
   Such attempts to use the FBI to transform an ominous
political or social issue into a crime-busting crusade date
back to the post-World War I Red scare and the bureau's
formative anti-radical investigations under J. Edgar Hoover.
During the Great Depression, Mr. Hoover, a genius
image-crafter, countered the loss of national confidence with
a dramatic demonstration of government power: the FBI's
successful gangster cases against the likes of Machine Gun
Kelly, John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd.
   In his definitive Hoover biography, "Secrecy and Power,"
historian Richard Powers observes that the gangster hunts of
the '30s "had no obvious relation to the fundamental crisis
of the depression" but nevertheless showed that the New Deal
government could exercise legitimate power in the face of
chaos.
   For most of this century, Mr. Powers says in an interview,
"there has been a constant desperation in Washington for
magic to make major problems go away, and the FBI used to
have that magic."
   Before and during World War II, President Franklin
Roosevelt deployed Mr. Hoover's FBI to track communist and
fascist spies, in part to demonstrate the U.S. government's
ability to defend against any foreign threat. After the war,
as communism spread internationally, the FBI pursued leftists
at home in a campaign that led to investigative excesses that
permanently tainted Mr. Hoover's reputation.
   Today, rather than accepting the responsibility that both
the legislative and executive branches bear for the S&amp;L mess,
politicians are hoping for a little of that old FBI magic.
The trouble is that in the more enlightened post-Hoover era,
the trick doesn't work anymore.
   Politicians trying to deflect public outrage demonize
those who were caught looting the S&amp;L tills and point to the
FBI as the solution. The huge majority of thrift failures,
however, and the monstrously expensive clean-up, resulted not
from criminal acts, but from a combination of greed,
mismanagement and lack of civil regulation.
   Moreover, no one believes anymore in the mythical special
agents of yore. FBI Director William Sessions, to his credit,
is no J. Edgar Hoover. Mr. Sessions refuses to brag that his
agents can track down the pin-striped S&amp;L villains as if they
were so many machine gun-toting members of Ma Barker's gang.
   FBI agents, though still a tight-lipped bunch, themselves
admit shortcomings that would have resulted in instant
ostracism under Mr. Hoover. Lawrence Lawler, chief of the
FBI's Los Angeles office, says his swamped white-collar crime
team investigates only a tiny fraction of the thousands of
S&amp;L cases they know of. Gary Penrith, the bureau's chief in
Newark, N.J., says he lacks sufficient agents with adequate
financial skills to handle an emerging wave of suspicious
bank and thrift failures in that state.
   In short, the FBI, which has never specialized in
following convoluted paper trails, is refusing to accept the
mission of rooting out all S&amp;L evil. When political attention
returns to this subject, officials may find that the solution
doesn't lie in arrests and convictions.
