   The U.S.'s allies in the standoff against Iraq expressed
strong support for Washington's approach to the crisis. But
it is the Arabs -- particularly the Saudis and Kuwaitis --
who are most willing to open their wallets.
   In three days of talks with Arab leaders last week,
Secretary of State James Baker succeeded in winning
multibillion-dollar pledges that appear large enough to cover
the entire extra cost of $1 billion or so a month that the
Pentagon is shouldering because of the huge deployment of
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia -- at least over the next few
months.

   But he also found that Arab leaders were growing impatient
with the diplomatic and economic campaign designed to punish
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for his Aug. 2 invasion and
continuing occupation of Kuwait, and that they might prefer
military action to oust the Iraqi invaders.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who led a
similar presidential mission to major European and Asian
allies, stressed the need to ensure the effectiveness of the
blockade against Iraq. That, he argued, would only be
achieved by providing sufficient aid to nearby friendly
states that have been economically harmed by the crisis.
   He won strong support for this approach from Britain's
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French leaders, and on
Friday the European Community voted to grant $2 billion of
emergency aid to such countries as Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
   Japan, which has already pledged $1 billion to aid the
effort against Iraq, didn't immediately respond to Mr.
Brady's request for further billions of dollars. Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Mr. Brady's mission Friday that
his government will study the U.S. proposals. South Korea,
which has benefited enormously from U.S. military backing for
more than 40 years, pledged to continue funding a few
$100,000 transport trips to Saudi Arabia from the U.S.
   Mr. Brady argued to U.S. allies that the costs of a joint
international effort against Iraq are much less than the
costs of an Iraqi-controlled oil price.
   "Our principal message throughout this trip," Mr. Brady
said after meetings in Britain, France, South Korea and
Japan, "has been that there is a cost which all must share,
of maintaining a freely flowing source of oil at prices
determined by market forces." The $10-a-barrel increase since
the Iraqi invasion would cost Japan roughly $20 billion a
year, his aides estimated.
   The Arabs, though, showed much greater readiness to give
direct and sizable military aid to the U.S.-led campaign to
confront Iraq. The exiled emir of Kuwait, who received Mr.
Baker at a Sheraton hotel in a Saudi resort town, promised $5
billion through the end of this year. That sum includes
around $600 million a month to be paid to the U.S. to defray
military costs and $2.5 billion to help compensate Egypt,
Turkey and possibly Jordan for the cost of the trade embargo
against Iraq.
   Sheik Zayid of Abu Dhabi, president of the United Arab
Emirates, also pledged an unspecified but large monthly
payment, U.S. officials said.
   Those pledges came after Saudi Arabian King Fahd told the
secretary of state his government will pay all the monthly
"in-country" costs of the 100,000 U.S. troops expected to be
on Saudi territory to deter further Iraqi military moves -- a
sum likely to amount to several hundred million dollars a
month. The Saudis, who put their total contribution at
"several billion dollars," also pledged to aid hard-hit
neighbors.
   The recent jump in oil prices has left Saudi Arabia
well-equipped to contribute to the effort. A $10-a-barrel
rise in the price of crude means Saudi Arabia's oil revenue
has risen $50 million or more a day, not counting the extra
two million barrels a day the country has promised to pump.
The additional revenue is about $500 million more a month
than the Pentagon's $1 billion monthly costs in the region.
   While details remain to be worked out, and while some of
the funds may be supplied indirectly or through "in kind"
contributions of such things as fuel or transport, Mr. Baker
seemed to have accomplished his economic mission even before
fund-raising visits this week to West Germany, Italy and
Belgium. He and his aides talked freely to reporters about
the financial pledges.
   However, raising money for the military effort from the
Europeans Mr. Baker will visit this week may be difficult.
Except for Britain and France, which already are directly
involved in the military effort, the Europeans are generally
leery of contributing directly to the U.S. military campaign.
They prefer less sensitive contributions, such as aid to
Mideast countries hurt by the Iraqi invasion and the
international trade embargo against Iraq.
   Mr. Baker's talks with Arab leaders also focused on
whether economic sanctions and political pressure can be
sustained for months, whether any compromise settlement might
be tolerable and whether war might be the only way to
dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   On these topics, the secretary and his aides declined to
disclose many details of the talks, which included a
90-minute one-on-one meeting between Mr. Baker and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Mubarak's brief public comments
after the session hinted that Arab patience with diplomacy
and sanctions may be limited.
   While the Egyptian leader said, "we would like, first of
all, to try peaceful solutions," he announced he would send
more troops to Saudi Arabia to expand the 2,000-man Egyptian
contingent already present. He also said economic sanctions
should be relied upon to stop Iraq only if they seem likely
to be effective and suggested it would be unwise to wait too
long for the sanctions to do the job.
   The Egyptian president also hinted that Iraq must be
stripped of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. "I
think peace will never go with the presence of all these form
of weapons in the area," he asserted.
   President Mubarak, King Fahd and others could be in
serious political and physical danger now that they have
publicly lined up against the ruthless Iraqi leader. They are
believed to be eager to end the crisis swiftly and defeat
Saddam Hussein decisively, even if it means war.
   Mr. Mubarak's public reaction echoed comments made by
Kuwaiti and Saudi officials. Yahya al Sumait, the Kuwaiti
housing minister, told a press conference that the U.S.
should set a deadline for the sanctions to work and then use
military might to enforce an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said
the occupation of Kuwait "is not a negotiable issue between
Iraq and anybody."
