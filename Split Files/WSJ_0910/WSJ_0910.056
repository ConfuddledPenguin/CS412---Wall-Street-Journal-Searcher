   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. -- PHM Corp. said its board
authorized the company to buy back as many as one million
shares of its stock from time to time over the next year.
   The home-building company said the shares may be purchased
through transactions in the open market, private negotiations
or a combination of both. The shares will be purchased with
cash, and become authorized but unissued shares available for
general corporate purposes.
