   OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate rose to 8.3% of the
work force in August from 7.8% in July as a result of the
country's current economic slowdown, Statistics Canada, a
federal agency, said. The August figure was the highest
jobless rate since October 1987.
   Employment declined 0.5% in August to 12.6 million, its
lowest level since last December.
