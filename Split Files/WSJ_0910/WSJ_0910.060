   Business survival depends on how well managers read trends
and anticipate the problems they create. Yet many companies
are ignoring powerful signals of trouble ahead in their most
critical competitive resource -- the work force.
   Demographic changes are fundamentally altering the
American work force, and industry must implement more active
strategies to efficiently develop that increasingly scarce
asset. In the 1990s, labor force growth will be less than a
third what it was in the 1970s. A bigger share of that
smaller labor pool will consist of people who have
traditionally been absent from the ranks of business
leadership -- women, minorities and immigrants.

   Although the Labor Department estimates that 85% of work
force entrants in the 1990s will be drawn from those groups,
other studies indicate that more than 95% of senior corporate
executives are white males. The top executives at my own
company, Union Carbide, are all white males.
   Such statistics send an unmistakable, urgent signal to
business: We all have to do a better job of recruiting and
developing minority managerial talent or we will run out of
the people we need to run our companies.
   Some companies understand the need to take a more active
role in developing minority managers to keep their businesses
viable into the 21st century, but too many cling to
traditional recruitment and "open door" affirmative-action
programs.
   That's a prescription for failure. Just opening the
company's doors to minority applicants will not be enough.
Traditional methods will not bring more people into the
pipeline, nor will they develop the minority managerial
talent upon which our future economy depends. Many minority
youngsters view the corporate environment as unfamiliar, even
threatening, territory. It will be necessary to help prepare
promising young people for college, nurture their talents,
interest them in corporate careers, and foster their progress
in the managerial ranks.
   That's a tall order for most companies -- alien to the way
corporations operate and outside their areas of expertise.
   Ideally, there should be a nationwide organization that,
with corporate support, would develop corporate-ready
minority professionals, prepared for entry-level management
jobs and able to move on to increasingly responsible
positions. Such an organization would identify promising
minority high school students, prepare them for college,
place them in supervised corporate summer internships, and
provide counseling and support services to groom them for
corporate careers.
   Fortunately, such an organization exists. It is called
Inroads, and it celebrates its 20th anniversary this month.
   To declare my interest, Union Carbide was a charter member
of the first Inroads affiliate and is a strong believer in
the Inroads philosophy and process. I've been personally
involved in the organization since 1983, and will shortly
assume its national chairmanship.
   Inroads began in 1970 with 25 young people sponsored by 17
Chicago-area companies. The ground-breaking idea caught on,
and there are now over 2,000 Inroads alumni pursuing
managerial and professional careers at companies across the
country.
   One Inroads alumnus is president of a corporate
subsidiary; another is CEO of an investment banking firm; six
are corporate vice presidents, and two own one of the largest
minority businesses in the U.S.
   Considering the small size of the early Inroads classes --
and that it generally takes 21 years or more for a business
career to lead to top managerial post -- that's a remarkable
success story.
   Today, Inroads has offices in 37 cities, over 1,000
sponsoring companies, and more than 4,100 internships.
   Compared to the economy's urgent need to develop minority
managerial talent, Inroads' strong growth amounts to just a
blip on the screen. But as the labor force crunch begins to
hit harder, I expect more companies to sign on as sponsors.
   Inroads interns are selected from the top 10th of their
high school classes, and are required to meet high academic
and on-the-job performance standards while actively
participating in training workshops, counseling and tutorial
programs, and community service projects. It is a long-term,
stringent program that ensures those who finish the course
have what it takes to succeed in the most demanding features
of corporate life.
   Finding qualified youngsters to fill the available
internships has never been a problem -- typically, Inroads
has two or three high-potential candidates for every
available internship. Given the nominal and very
cost-effective investment a company makes in sponsoring an
intern, U.S. corporations can easily support a quantum leap
in internships. More companies should participate in the
program, and they should expand the number of interns they
sponsor.
   It's not a matter of corporate altruism, but of corporate
self-interest.
