   TOKYO -- With at least a year to go before Toys "R" Us
Inc. opens its first stores in Japan, the U.S. retailing
juggernaut already has sparked a frenzy in the Japanese toy
world.
   A group of 11 Japanese toy store companies is preparing to
launch on Sept. 28 the Japan Association of Specialty Toy
Shops. Its mission: to increase efficiency in the
distribution system so that member companies "can withstand
the onslaught of foreign-owned" competitors, such as
you-know-who.

   "The distribution system is likely to change," says Masami
Kobayashi, a spokesman for the new association, adding: "We
don't want to be left behind."
   That theme resounds throughout Japan's retailing industry
these days. While mom-and-pop shops and labyrinthine
wholesaler networks still dominate the Japanese distribution
system, the 1980s brought a trend toward larger stores and
modern chains. Many younger Japanese decided they would
prefer a white-collar career to taking over their parents'
storefront operations.
   Japan's toy industry has been slow to respond to this
broad shift. But Toys "R" Us may provide a strong shove.
   "With toys, (the market) is just ripe" for change, says
Joy Walbert, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in Tokyo.
"It has happened in do-it-yourself home centers, superstores,
shoes and men's clothes" stores. Toy makers "recognize there
will be change" and already have begun moving to streamline
their distribution networks, she adds.
   Sales of toys and games in Japan in 1988, the latest year
for which figures are available, totaled almost 600 billion
yen, or about $4.2 billion at current exchange rates.
   Few toy makers are willing to talk openly, however, about
whether they would agree to bypass the traditional wholesaler
system and sell directly to Toys "R" Us outlets -- as is done
in the U.S.
   "We can't give you a clear answer," says a spokeswoman for
Bandai Co., a major toy maker. "Anything Bandai would say
would have a great influence on wholesalers," she says,
adding: "They are very nervous. Even the smallest comments
cause concern." Nintendo Co., whose electronic games are a
leading attraction at Toys "R" Us outlets in the U.S., is
equally tight-lipped. "We haven't had any inquiries" from
Toys "R" Us about supplying the planned Japanese stores, says
a spokeswoman at the Kyoto-based company, which carries on
all its Japanese business through a group of about 70
wholesalers.
   Some wholesalers aren't waiting around to find out how the
toy makers will react.
   A spokesman for K.K. Kawata, a major Tokyo-based
distributor of Nintendo products, says that company plans to
expand the 30% of its business that comes from manufacturing
Lego-like plastic blocks and other toys.
   In addition, Kawata recently agreed to acquire a Tokyo
discount toy store that may serve as a basis for developing
Kawata's own chain of retail outlets, according to the
spokesman, Masashi Tsujimoto. Both moves would effectively
dilute Kawata's traditional middleman role.
   Because Toys "R" Us will incur high land and other
overhead costs in Japan, some local discounters may be able
to undercut the American chain's prices here, Mr. Tsujimoto
predicts. He also contends that Toys "R" Us will have to
learn to tailor its offerings to Japanese children's tastes
if it is to repeat its success in other markets.
   Japanese tots prefer collections of small toys -- such as
the characters promoted by Japanese makers through television
cartoons -- to the "Southeast Asian-style big plastic toys"
that appear on U.S. store shelves, he says.
   Toys "R" Us is seeking to open five stores in late 1991,
and to add 10 stores in each of the next several years,
according to a spokesman for McDonald's Corp. (Japan), which
owns 20% of the Toys "R" Us operation in Japan. But the plans
are contingent, in part, on securing local permits.
   After several years of haranguing by U.S. trade
negotiators, Japanese authorities earlier this year agreed to
change the rules by which local governments in Japan handle
applications for stores of more than 500 square meters in
size.
   Previously, local mom-and-pop shops could drag out the
application process for years by refusing to attend hearings.
Now, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
requires that applications be ruled on within 18 months.
   The initial Toys "R" Us applications have produced some
opposition. In Sagamihara, about 30 miles southwest of Tokyo,
a planned 3,538-square-meter outlet has stirred concerns
about traffic congestion in the predominately residential
neighborhood around the site.
   The 4,997-square-meter store that Toys "R" Us proposes to
open in the provincial city of Niigata in 1992 would be equal
to about half the total floor space of the 60-odd toy stores
in Niigata, according to the local chamber of commerce.
"We're just saying reduce it to a size that's more
appropriate to the region," says Masao Sakurai, president of
a small local toy-store chain that is among the project's
opponents.
   Under Japan's large-scale stores law, a committee of local
businessmen, consumers and academics could recommend that the
size of the planned store be reduced to as little as 500
square meters though the trade and industry agency has the
final say if a company disputes the local ruling.
   Joseph Baczko, president of the international division of
Toys "R" Us in Paramus, N.J., says he's confident that
Japanese authorities won't reduce floor plans for any of the
stores below the 3,000 square meters that Toys "R" Us
considers the minimum size for its units.
   According to the British Association of Toy Retailers, the
number of toy stores in Britain shrank to about 2,000 from
3,500 during the first five or six years after Toys "R" Us
arrived there, with the U.S. company only one of several
factors behind the decline.
   Toys "R" Us now has close to a 10% market share in
Britain, almost equal to market leader F.W. Woolworth Co.'s,
according to Gerry Masters, general secretary of the British
association. Toys "R" Us reported world-wide sales of $943.6
million, up 23%, for its fiscal first quarter, ended April
29.
