   SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's economic development
plan for 1992 to 1996 sets as a goal average annual economic
growth rate of 7%, the Economic Planning Board said Friday.
   The government agency said the goal was contained in a set
of basic guidelines for working out the five-year plan to be
completed by next August.

   At that growth rate, officials said, South Korea's gross
national product would rise from an estimated $231.7 billion
in 1990 to $454 billion in 1996, with per capita GNP nearly
doubling from $5,430 this year to $10,050 in 1996. South
Korea's GNP grew 6.7% in 1989.
   Planning board officials said the current account is
expected to show a $5 billion surplus in 1996, compared with
a deficit of $1 billion expected for this year.
   South Korea is expected to become a net creditor nation
over the five-year period, they said, with its external
assets exceeding its external debts. South Korea has been a
debtor nation for decades.
   According to the guidelines, the five-year plan will
stress technological innovation and call for increasing the
ratio of investment in research and development from 2.2% at
present to between 3% and 4% in 1996.
   To prepare for a new global economic order as a result of
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the government
plans to transform the current farm-based rural economy into
a mixture of primary, secondary and tertiary industries,
officials said.
   They added that South Korea plans to play a greater
economic role within the Asia-Pacific region and expand
economic ties with the European Community and Eastern bloc
countries.
