   Polish writer Radek Sikorski explaining in the April 14
issue of the Spectator of London why he has bought a ruined
country house in Poland:

   If it were only a question of getting a nice house to live
in, one would never bother. Rebuilding Chobielin will be my
labor of love, my contribution to rebuilding Poland and my
personal battle against the remnants of communism. It'll also
be a spiritual experience. I want to purify these few acres
of Poland from the filth of communist rule. God willing, in a
few years' time my guests will be able to enjoy a hearty
lunch, take a stroll along the river, look around and think
that communism somehow spared this remote place. That'll be
my greatest pleasure and reward. On this patch of land it
will seem as if communism had never existed.
