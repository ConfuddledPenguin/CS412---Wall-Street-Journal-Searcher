   ISTANBUL, Turkey -- The Turkish government is maneuvering
into a position it hopes will spare it bloodshed and give it
a powerful place at any peace talks at the end of the Mideast
crisis.
   The path is not easy, but President Turgut Ozal has shown
no fear of retaliation by his Iraqi neighbors or qualms about
riding roughshod over protests from across Turkey's political
spectrum that he is leading the nation into a treacherous
military adventure.

   Mr. Ozal strengthened his hand when the Turkish parliament
voted to transfer to the government its powers to allow the
nation to host foreign troops and to deploy its 800,000-man
armed forces abroad. Turkey has the second-largest armed
force in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the
U.S.
   "This gives them the power to do whatever they want to do,
or maybe nothing at all," said a senior Western diplomat in
Ankara. "But it is a strong political signal of determination
to be with the West, pushing for Iraq's total withdrawal from
Kuwait."
   Washington might like to see Turkey's Moslem troops on the
ground in Saudi Arabia, but Prime Minister Yildirim Akbulut
has said troop movements would be a last resort. However, a
Turkish ship might be sent to join the Gulf naval blockade,
he said.
   The new powers might be used to allow increased U.S. use
of air bases near the Iraqi border or even troops to put
pressure on Iraq from a second front. But the Western
diplomat, who declined to be identified, said there had been
no such request for troop deployments and nor was one
pending.
   Mr. Akbulut said he needed the extra war powers from
parliament to "protect Turkey's higher interests during and
after the crisis . . . and help a speedy and active policy,"
adding later that "this is not permission to declare war."
   Others saw different motives for what right-wing True Path
Party leader Suleyman Demirel said was Mr. Ozal being "more
royalist than a king" in his support for U.S. policies in the
Gulf.
   The question of how Turkey is to be compensated for at
least $3 billion of economic damage from the embargo on Iraq
is likely to top the agenda when Mr. Ozal meets President
Bush Sept. 24 in Washington.
   In addition to a fall in trade and transit revenue,
Turkey's tourism industry is beginning to suffer badly
because of the proximity to the Gulf crisis, said Behaettin
Yucel, head of the Turkish Travel Agents Association. This
blow defies an air of normality in Turkey, where even the
transit of 20,000 refugees from Iraq has passed almost
unnoticed.
   Mr. Yucel estimated that 100,000 expected visitors had
canceled their trips as of last Monday and said that charter
flights from Spain have been canceled completely even for the
winter season.
   "We estimate losses of $250 million so far, not counting
transport and shopping," Mr. Yucel said.
   To help out, the U.S. is going ahead with a loan for
several hundred million dollars from the U.S. Export-Import
bank for co-production of military helicopters, possibly
Sikorsky Black Hawks, diplomats say. The U.S. also is likely
to increase quotas for Turkish textile imports and pressure
for the approval of held-up International Monetary Fund loans
totaling $1.4 billion.
   But economic questions alone do not explain the way Turkey
has gone out on a limb.
   "After the crisis, the map of the Middle East will change
completely . . . if there is a better place for us in the
world, we must take it," President Ozal told Sabah newspaper
this week.
   Right-wing Turkish newspapers have raised the question of
recovering "our land" in the oil-rich provinces of Mosul and
Kerkuk just south of Turkey whose loss in the 1920s to
British-mandated Iraq is still regretted by many Turks.
   "Mr. Ozal is a statesman who has never mentioned this. But
my personal opinion is that we have a rightful claim to Mosul
and Kirkuk," said Altemur Kilic, editor of the right-wing
Tercuman newspaper. "This would need to be taken into
consideration (at any peace conference)."
   Mr. Kilic said it also was important that any conference
rule out the idea of an independent state in the north of
Iraq for the Kurds, a large minority in Turkey where they are
denied any ethnic rights.
   Such arguments carry little weight with the many
commentators who are calling for Turkey to be kept away from
the quicksands of the gulf, remembering the bloody campaigns
during World War I when the Ottoman Turkish Empire lost
control of the Arabian peninsula.
   "I see the wish for war in Prime Minister Akbulut and the
man who gives him instructions, Ozal," said Erdal Inonu,
leader of the main Social Democrat opposition party. "What
everyone will understand from this is that we want to go to
war to increase our territory. It's a dream to think we will
take a share of the Middle East. This is gambling."
