   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- TCBY Enterprises Inc. said its board
more than tripled the quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share
from three cents, payable Sept. 25 to stock of record Sept.
19.
   TCBY, a franchiser of retail stores that sell frozen
yogurt, didn't give a reason for the increase, and company
officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   TCBY's stock price has fallen sharply in recent weeks,
following news of declines in sales for stores open at least
a year and a disclosure by the company that it expects to
report that net income for the third quarter ended Aug. 31
fell to between 25 and 30 cents a share from 43 cents in the
year-earlier period.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
before the dividend news was released, TCBY shares closed at
$6.375, down 12.5 cents.
