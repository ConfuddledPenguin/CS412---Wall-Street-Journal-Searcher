   WASHINGTON -- The administration said it completed
negotiations with South Korea for the sale of 120 McDonnell
Douglas Corp. F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers under a $4.7
billion program leading eventually to licensed production of
the planes in Korea.
   The administration formally notified Congress of the
agreement, signaling the conclusion of protracted wrangling
over work shares and technology security. Unless Congress
votes to block it, the program will be in operation in 30
days.

   The Pentagon said the program will proceed in three
phases, starting with McDonnell Douglas's delivery of 12
completed planes to South Korea, followed by kits for 36
planes to be assembled in Korea. In the final phase the
Korean contractor, Samsung Aerospace Corp., will produce the
remaining 72 aircraft under license.
   The core of the program will be worth $3.2 billion to
McDonnell Douglas and its engine supplier, General Electric
Co. GE will provide 24 spare F-404 engines in addition to
those to be mounted on the twin-engine Hornets. Other
commercial contracts for technical assistance, assembly-line
tools, and other equipment will raise the total value of the
program to $4.7 billion, the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said 30% of the commercial value of the
program will be shared by Korean contractors. A Samsung
spokesman said this proportion of offsetting revenues is
"very low" compared with what other countries have extracted
from U.S. defense vendors. The Pentagon will protect the
security of certain "technology-sensitive" Hornet components
through government-to-government arrangements with Seoul, the
Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon withheld the formal signing of a memorandum
of understanding with Seoul until after the 30-day
congressional review. "We'd like to give Congress every
opportunity to look at it," a Pentagon spokesman said. In a
roughly similar case last year, the Bush administration was
forced to revise an earlier agreement on Japan's
co-development of the FSX fighter after it encountered fierce
opposition in Congress.
   The Korean program, however, isn't likely to have as much
trouble. Sens. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.)
have sharply questioned the Korean co-production arrangement,
but most of their colleagues don't consider it to be as
threatening to the U.S. leadership in aerospace as the FSX
pact, which allows the Japanese to co-develop a new plane
based on General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16.
   A Samsung spokesman said the company will enter into two
commercial agreements -- one on equipment purchase and
another on license rights -- after the program is approved by
Congress.
