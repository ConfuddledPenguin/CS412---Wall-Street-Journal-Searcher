   WASHINGTON -- A Commerce Department report said that
heavily subsidized Airbus Industrie has little chance of ever
becoming profitable and that its continued operations could
permanently injure the U.S. aerospace industry.
   The report was disclosed as U.S. trade negotiators stepped
up their efforts to persuade four European governments to
give up further financial support for the aerospace companies
that make up the Airbus consortium. The U.S. has threatened
to file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade if the issue isn't resolved by Sept. 30.

   The report, prepared by Gellman Research Associates Inc.
of Jenkintown, Pa., and adopted by the department, said there
is "little likelihood" of Airbus ever paying back an
estimated $13.5 billion in loans and other subsidies from the
French, German, British and Spanish governments. By the year
2008, Airbus could have a cumulative negative cash flow of
$30 billion in 1990 dollars, the report predicted.
   "None of Airbus' projects, past, present and in
development, appears to be commercially viable," the report
concluded. The European governments claim that the consortium
could become profitable as a result of the currently strong
demand for passenger airliners.
   The report criticized the Airbus partnership as
anti-competitive. The report said the three largest civil
aircraft makers in Europe have removed themselves as
potential joint venture partners with companies from the U.S.
and elsewhere unless the activity involves the entire
consortium.
   Continued Airbus subsidies could cut sharply into the
profits of U.S. manufacturers, forcing them to either seek
foreign capital or give up further chunks of the airliner
market, the report said.
