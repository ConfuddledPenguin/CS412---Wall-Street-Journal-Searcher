   TORRANCE, Calif. -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm is
raising base prices on its 1991 Corolla and Camry models
between 2.9% and 3.1% from 1990 levels.
   The increases on Toyota's biggest-selling models are
slightly less aggressive than those announced by Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp. for certain rival models. Ford
and GM raised prices on many of their 1991 models 4% or more
from a year ago.

   Toyota attributed its increases in part to new standard
equipment such as larger tires, tilt steering wheel, power
mirrors and an upgraded audio system. The Camry and Corolla
account for about 70% of Toyota's sales in the U.S., and
booming sales of both have helped to push the company's U.S.
sales and market share to record levels despite a weak
overall market. Both cars are built in U.S. factories.
   The steepest price boost is on the Camry. The least
expensive Camry will have a 1991 base price of $11,948, up
3.1% from $11,588 a year earlier. But the Camry still has a
lower base price than many rival, middle-priced family
sedans. Honda Motor Co.'s lowest-priced 1991 Accord DX sedan
starts at $12,545, up 1.6% from a year ago.
   By contrast, Ford boosted the price of its middle-priced
sedan, the 1991 Ford Taurus, 8.5% to $13,717 for 1991. The
lowest-priced 1991 Chevrolet Lumina sedan will start at
$12,870, up 4.3% from last fall. Both cars are slightly
larger than the Camry.
   The 1991 Corolla will have a base price of $8,998, up 2.9%
from $8,748 in 1990. That's more expensive than the
lowest-priced 1991 Nissan Sentra, which starts at $7,999 and
gets a major redesign this fall. However, the base 1991
Corolla will start for less than its U.S. twin, the $9,680
Geo Prizm sold by GM's Chevrolet division.
