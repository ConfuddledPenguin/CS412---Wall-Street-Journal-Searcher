   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Amcore Financial Inc. said its board has
authorized the purchase of as much as $6 million of its
common stock from time to time through the open market or
privately negotiated purchases.
   The bank holding company said the program is in addition
to a $2 million buyback announced last June. Amcore said
about $1.6 million of common stock has been purchased under
the prior authorization.
