   A plan to end random border inspections of meat and
poultry shipped between the U.S. and Canada is raising safety
questions on both sides of the border.
   U.S. and Canadian agriculture officials, as part of
efforts to increase free trade, have agreed to suspend the
checks for contamination in a one-year test of an "open
border" concept. But meat inspectors on both sides contend
the plan will undercut consumer protection against filthy
food and misbranded products. "We aren't shipping furniture
or shoes back and forth; we're dealing with perishable
foods," says Frederick Coates, the union president
representing Canada's food inspectors. "With this open-border
crossing, all control will be lost."

   In the U.S., political opposition to the plan is building
in Congress. The Senate will consider legislation to ensure
continued spot-checks of Canadian shipments. "Reducing trade
distortions at the border doesn't mean that the U.S.
government should throw up its hands and walk away from that
border," says Rep. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who
heads the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Currently, meat and poultry exports are inspected at
slaughterhouses and processing plants in both nations, and
then randomly "re-inspected" at the border or at their
destinations. Under the bilateral plan, the U.S. would rely
on Canadian meat inspectors to protect Americans from food
poisoning and product mislabeling, and Canada would trust in
U.S. inspectors.
   U.S. and Canadian officials express full confidence in
each other's meat-inspection practices. But Democratic Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota declared at a hearing recently on
the open-border proposal: "This is one of the biggest
examples of blind faith I've ever seen."
   Meat and poultry products account for a large part of
nearly $6 billion a year in U.S.-Canada trade in agricultural
commodities. The U.S. Agriculture Department says only 1% of
704 million pounds of all Canadian meat and poultry products
were rejected last year at the border. Meanwhile, only 1.3%
of the 317 million pounds of U.S. products going north were
found to be unfit for consumption or improperly labeled,
according to Agriculture Canada.
   But inspectors on both sides of the border contend those
figures are misleading. What really counts is the rejection
rate of the meat that was actually inspected, says William
Lehman, a U.S. border inspector at Sweet Grass, Mont. On May
11, he says he turned back 36% of the Canadian meat he
checked. On May 18, it was 14%, and the next day 22%, he
says.
   "I found fecal material, blood clots, hair, bruises, green
pus-filled abscesses that should have been obvious to people
preparing the product," says Mr. Lehman.
   In Pembina, N.D., inspector Thomas Grube says he, too, has
had similar days. Last year, he refused entry to 9.6% of the
truckloads that had been randomly selected by computer for
inspection. Much of the rejected meat was unskinned hams.
"Statistically, it tells me 10% of the product that we don't
have an opportunity to look at should be refused."
   "This open-border Mickey Mouse hasn't started yet, but the
product is already going downhill," an inspector in Blaine,
Wash., Lester Wagner, says of ham shipped by some Canadian
packers. "They've got it pumped so full of liquid it squishes
when you squeeze it. The crazy thing feels like a sponge."
   At the same time, Canadian inspectors say they have been
catching trucks carrying U.S. beef mixed in with shipments of
photocopying chemicals and other "incompatible" freight.
   This summer, just as the Agriculture Department began
taking formal comments from the public on the one-year
experiment, it had to oversee a nationwide recall of 22,000
pounds of Canadian frankfurters. U.S. inspectors at the
Buffalo border post had detected listeria, a sometimes deadly
strain of bacteria, in franks made by J.M. Schneider Inc.,
Kitchener, Ontario. State health officials have been
investigating reports of illness in New York and elsewhere.
   Under the open-border plan, the same inspectors who caught
the tainted franks would be taken off border duty. But
Canadian and U.S. officials insist there is nothing
extraordinary about the recall and that both nations have
strong inspection programs. "Their inspection is equivalent
to ours," says Lester Crawford, director of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   "You very seldom get food poisoning in the U.S. It's the
same in Canada. What's so magic about the border?" says Andre
Gravel, director of Agriculture Canada's meat and poultry
products division.
   Despite a recent Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. and
Canada, border inspections remain a serious irritant in
bilateral relations. Canadian exporters have long complained
about harassment by overzealous U.S. inspectors. The Bush
administration is predisposed to remedy the problem. One of
its main objectives is global "harmonization" of sanitary
standards, including food-safety regulations, to reduce
impediments to trade. The result: On Feb. 26, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter agreed to undertake the open-border
experiment with Canada.
   "We want to have reciprocal inspection, if we can work it
out," says the department's Mr. Crawford. "We hope to open up
a lot of borders. This experiment . . . could be applied to
other countries."
   Auditors for the General Accounting Office, the audit arm
of Congress, however, found that the department has very
little documented evidence to prove that Canada's inspection
system is as strict or effective as its own.
   Yielding to pressure from Congress, the Agriculture
Department just gave consumers and others an additional 30
days (until Sept. 5) to comment on the plan. Caught in the
middle of the fracas -- and fearful of the public-relations
fallout -- are meat producers, packers and processors on both
sides of the border.
   U.S. meatpackers fear U.S. consumers won't be able
distinguish between U.S. and Canadian products at the
supermarket and "will become suspicious of all meat," says
Mark Ulven, an aide to Sen. Daschle. But some U.S. inspectors
say they don't think Canadian products coming in are
necessarily any worse than U.S. products going north.
   The American Meat Institute and the Canadian Meat Council
are calling for a bilateral panel of government, industry,
and consumer representatives to monitor the one-year
experiment. "In theory, the proposal sounds good, but we're
going to have to look at it very closely," says Thomas Cook,
Washington lobbyist for the National Cattlemen's Association.
   Agriculture Canada's Mr. Gravel believes the concerns will
eventually be resolved. "We have bad operators and the U.S.
has bad operators," he says. "It's a matter of making sure
these bad guys are caught. Sooner or later, we're going to
catch them."
