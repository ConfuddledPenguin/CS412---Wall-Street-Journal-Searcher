   Under pressure from a federal judge to come up with more
money for asbestos victims, Manville Corp. agreed to pay as
much as $520 million over the next seven years to the
Manville asbestos personal-injury trust.
   The first installments of the new funding, however, fall
far short of the amount the trust has tried to raise in
recent months as it ran out of cash to pay the 130,000 claims
against it. Moreover, the preliminary agreement, announced
Friday, won't provide any new cash until the end of 1991. The
plan is also contingent on many other factors.

   The trust, the cornerstone of Manville's bankruptcy-court
reorganization plan in 1988, was set up to pay all health
claims stemming from exposure to asbestos products formerly
made by the company. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court
in New York ordered the trust to come up with new financing
this summer after the trust announced that it couldn't pay
new claims for 25 years because it was out of cash.
   Although victims' attorneys welcomed the new funding, some
said they will challenge the change because they believe that
Judge Weinstein does not have the right to alter Manville's
bankruptcy reorganization plan. The attorneys fear that
victims will lose some rights if the plan is revamped. They
also are challenging a freeze on claim payments that Judge
Weinstein has extended until Oct. 6.
   "To the extent that Manville has come up with more money
for the trust, I'm delighted," said Robert Hatten, a
plaintiffs' attorney who is trying to collect a $60 million
court judgment from the trust for 1,117 asbestos victims in
Virginia. "The only caveat I have is, I want my money."
   The preliminary funding agreement is contingent on the
trust coming up with new procedures for paying claims, such
as stretching payments over a period of time. Leon Silverman,
appointed by Judge Weinstein and the bankruptcy court to
negotiate the restructuring, said progress is being made in
talks between the trust and plaintiffs' attorneys about the
payment plan.
   "While this is only the first step in the overall
restructuring process, we are encouraged that a fair and
comprehensive resolution will result from the continuing
cooperation of all parties," said John C. Sawhill, chairman
of the trust's board.
   After paying about $638 million to asbestos victims, the
trust still owes more than $300 million in settled but unpaid
claims -- twice the amount of cash it has left. Before Judge
Weinstein stepped in, the trust and the company had been
unable to agree on new funding, although proposals to raise
more than $500 million were discussed.
   Under the agreement, Manville would convert the preferred
stock held by the Trust into common, giving the trust an 80%
stake in the company. The company would pay a special
dividend to common shareholders of $125 million late in 1991,
another $125 million a year later and $50 million in each of
the next two years.
   The agreement also provides for additional special
dividends to be paid in the next four years of as much as
$300 million, making a total potential dividend of $650
million, 80% of which -- or $520 million -- would go to the
trust. Except for the first proposed payment, the dividends
would be subject to Manville's ability to pay.
   The new financing would not affect the company's
obligation to pay $75 million a year on $1.8 billion in bonds
held by the trust and to pay the trust 20% of Manville's
profit beginning in 1992. The agreement also proposes
exchanging the bonds for new ones that would be marketable.
The trust would be able to sell the bonds at some point to
raise money.
   Manville's stock in recent months has suffered from the
uncertainties surrounding the trust funding, and officials of
the Denver-based building-products concern said they hope the
investment community will "look on this agreement
positively." In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday, Manville closed at $6.75 a share, up 75
cents.
   In a prepared announcement, Manville Chairman Tom Stephens
said, "Our strong performance since the consummation of the
plan of reorganization in 1988 has put us in the position to
be able to accomplish this distribution program."

   NEW YORK LAW FIRM bows out of fraudulent conveyance
action.
   Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan, accused of a conflict of
interest, agreed not to represent Southmark Corp. or its
creditors in a multimillion-dollar suit against two former
top officials of Southmark.
   The alleged conflict arose because Stroock, which served
as counsel to the Southmark unsecured creditors committee
during Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, once represented
the former executives, Gene E. Phillips and William S.
Friedman.
   When Stroock was retained by the creditors last year, both
men signed waivers saying they didn't object to the
representation.
   But then the creditors committee, acting on behalf of
Southmark, filed suit seeking to recover more than $83
million in assets from Messrs. Phillips and Friedman and
companies they control. The complaint alleged that the assets
were fraudulently conveyed to the men as part of their
resignation settlements last year.
   The former executives retained the Dallas firm of Bickel &amp;
Brewer to sue to have Stroock dismissed from the case.
   "I think it's one thing to consent to your former attorney
handling a nonadversarial matter, and something else for them
to turn around and sue you," said Mr. Friedman, former vice
chairman.
   After some legal maneuvering, Stroock agreed not to
represent either the creditors committee or Southmark in the
proceeding against the executives. But it is free to
represent the company, which recently emerged from bankruptcy
protection, in future legal matters.
   "We determined that, rather than spending another couple
of months litigating {the conflict issue}, reorganized
Southmark should be freed to litigate on the merits" of its
case against the executives, said Stroock partner Curtis
Mechling.

   COURT DECLINES TO EXPAND protection for Texas
whistleblowers.
   The case was brought by Richard Winters, a former Houston
Chronicle employee who said he was fired for telling
superiors about alleged circulation fraud and other illegal
activities at the newspaper, owned by Hearst Corp. A lower
court dismissed the suit, and the Texas Supreme Court
affirmed the dismissal.
   At issue was whether Texas should follow 23 other states
that protect private-sector employees who report illegal
activities in the workplace. Texas law does protect public
workers, but private employers, with rare exceptions, are
permitted to hire and fire employees at will.
   In ruling against Mr. Winters, the Texas Supreme Court
said his case didn't fall within the exceptions and said it
wasn't inclined "at this time on these facts" to broaden the
protection for private-sector whistleblowers. The decision
offered little additional explanation, but a concurring
opinion by Judge Lloyd Doggett suggested that more protection
should be warranted in some cases.
   "The judiciary should not ignore those unscrupulous
employers who wield the powerful weapon of the pink slip to
intimidate workers into silence in order to conceal and
perpetuate activities in the workplace that endanger the
public," Judge Doggett wrote.
   James W. Holtz, a Houston attorney representing Mr.
Winters, said he was disappointed the court didn't explain
its decision more fully but hadn't decided whether to seek a
rehearing.
   G.E. McDavid, president of the Chronicle, said the paper
had "expected" the court to rule in its favor, asserting that
Mr. Winters had made a number of "wild allegations" that
weren't true.

   TAX ON LEGAL SERVICES challenged in Massachusetts.
   The Massachusetts and Boston bar associations filed suit
in the state's Supreme Judicial Court challenging the
constitutionality of parts of a recently enacted 5% tax on
services.
   The associations are seeking to exempt legal services from
the tax, arguing that it illegally restricts access to legal
services, violates lawyer-client confidentiality and breaches
state and federal provisions that place the regulation of
lawyers solely under the judicial branch.
   In a statement, John P. Driscoll Jr., president of the
Boston association, said, "Although we have grave concerns
for the commonwealth's fiscal health, we are compelled to
take a stand against measures that play fast and free with
our fundamental constitutional rights."
   The suit also says that the tax is unfair and
discriminatory because it targets only certain businesses.
   The court has already determined that the tax might be
permissible, but it didn't address key issues of applying the
tax to legal services, the associations said.
   The 5% levy on a host of business services is one of the
broadest such taxes in the nation. It was signed into law in
July.

   SECOND OFFICER of New Jersey company pleads guilty to bank
fraud.
   Preston Davis, former assistant treasurer and assistant
controller of Coated Sales Inc., pleaded guilty in federal
court in Newark, N.J., to allegations he was involved in a
fraud scheme. Mr. Davis admitted that he and other officers
of the defunct textile converting concern lied about the
amount of the company's assets to secure a $52 million
restructuring loan from BancBoston Financial Co. He also
admitted to conspiring to violate U.S. securities laws.
   Peter V. Ryan, Mr. Davis's attorney, said his client
"accepted culpability" but was "following directions of his
superiors."
   Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-court
protection in June 1988, the company was considered one of
the fastest-growing ones traded on the over-the-counter
market, according to Michael Chertoff, U.S. attorney in
Newark. By securing the loan with fictitious accounts
receivable, the officers boosted the company's net sales,
total assets and earnings per share, he said.
   Last month, the company's former chief financial officer,
Bruce Bloom, also pleaded guilty to participating in the
scheme.
