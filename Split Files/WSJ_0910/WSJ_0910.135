   FRANKFURT -- West German authorities are investigating one
of the aerospace subsidiaries of Daimler-Benz AG for alleged
violations of export-control laws in the delivery of military
hardware to Iraq.
   The public prosecutor's office in Munich said it has begun
the investigation of aircraft maker
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., or MBB, a
majority-owned subsidiary of Daimler, West Germany's largest
industrial group.

   Heinz Stocker, senior district attorney in Munich, said
the inquiry follows allegations last week by a German
human-rights group, the Society for Endangered People, that
it uncovered what it called military hardware for Iraq at an
MBB storage site in Hoehenkirchen.
   MBB denied the allegations that it planned to ship
military hardware to Iraq. It said it halted sales to Iraq in
accordance with the United Nations embargo, of which West
Germany is a participant. The company said it has been
selling helicopters to Iraq since 1978, but that those
machines haven't been outfitted for military applications.
The company also supplies replacement parts for the
helicopters, but MBB said Friday that it ceased such
deliveries to Iraq Aug. 6.
   MBB said the parcels at the depot are being held there
because of the Iraqi trade embargo.
