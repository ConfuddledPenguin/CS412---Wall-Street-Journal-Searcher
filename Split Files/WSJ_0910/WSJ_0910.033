   SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp. won the bidding for the
remains of defunct Benjamin Franklin Savings &amp; Loan
Association, paying a record premium of $162.3 million, or
6.85% of the thrift's core deposits.
   Benjamin Franklin is based in Portland, Ore. The price
compares with the 3% to 5% of core deposits that the
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency that handles
dead thrifts, has been able to command in other sales of its
wards. Several analysts had predicted that the premium paid
for Benjamin Franklin would be in that range as well. The
higher premium BankAmerica paid means that it could take the
bank holding company five or six years to earn back its
investment -- more if the Oregon economy stalls as it did in
the early 1980s. But several analysts applauded the move as a
sound strategic step.

   The acquisition marked the second time in recent months
that the rejuvenated BankAmerica, which nearly failed in
1987, beat out West Coast rivals in bidding for a failed
thrift in a potentially lucrative market in the western U.S.
In June, BankAmerica acquired Western Savings &amp; Loan
Association, Phoenix, Ariz., from the RTC for $81 milllion,
or 4.6% of core depoits. In both cases, BankAmerica outdueled
Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, and several other big
West Coast competitors.
   BankAmerica said it purchased $2.7 billion of Benjamin
Franklin deposits and about $3 billion of assets. However,
the RTC estimated that only about $2.4 billion of the
deposits are so-called core deposits, which are local,
relatively inexpensive retail deposits that are considered
highly stable. The RTC retained $500.7 million of Benjamin
Franklin assets. If BankAmerica doesn't want to keep any of
the assets it acquired, it can transfer them back to the RTC
any time in the next three months.
   The RTC estimated that Benjamin Franklin's failure will
end up costing taxpayers $100.4 million.
   Benjamin Franklin was placed into conservatorship in
February. Although its loan portfolio wasn't as bad as those
of most troubled thrifts, it suffered from an interest rate
squeeze that eroded profit and a capital base that relied on
$282.7 million of good will, an accounting gimmick that new
capital guidelines spawned by the 1988 thrift rescue bill
rendered worthless.
   It also had sizable losses from a foray into
risk-controlled arbitrage, a complex investment strategy that
involves buying mortgage-backed securities and trying to
hedge against interest rate swings by purchasing futures and
options. In 1989, Benjamin Franklin had a net loss of $377.1
million, which included a write-off of its good will.
   Still, Benjamin Franklin was considered a hot property by
many thrift executives. It controls 10% of Oregon's total
deposits and has a well-placed network of 88 branches, mostly
in Oregon but also in Utah, Washington and Idaho. It is the
largest thrift and the third largest financial institution in
Oregon.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
BankAmerica closed at $22.625, up 50 cents.
   Separately, the RTC sold Home Owners Savings Bank,
Burlington, Mass., to two New England institutions.
   The RTC said it sold Home Owners' 17 Massachussetts
branches to United States Trust Co., Boston, and the thrift's
11 Sun Savings division branches in Maine to Peoples Heritage
Savings Bank, Portland, Maine.
   Home Owners had about $3 billion in assets and liabilities
of about $3.4 billion. The RTC will receive premiums of about
$6.1 million from the acquiring institutions. The RTC will
advance $1.8 billion to the acquirers and will retain $2.3
billion of Home Owners' assets. The agency expects to recover
some of the advances through asset sales but expects the
ultimate cost of the transaction to be about $806 million.
   The RTC said it chose U.S. Trust and Peoples Heritage from
12 potential bidders. Home Owners' liabilities included about
$2.5 billion in deposits in 184,000 accounts and $803 million
in secured liabilities, $95 million of which represented
prior RTC advances. Home Owners' core deposit base is
estimated at $1.3 billion, the RTC said.
