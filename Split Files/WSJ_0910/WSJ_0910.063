   Tom Marks ("Iraq's Not-So-Tough Army," editorial page,
Aug. 21) is correct that Iraq's armored force of 5,500 tanks
is equipped mainly with older designs inferior to the
American M-1 or later versions of the M-60. Yet it still
poses a formidable threat to the Marines and paratroopers
rushed to Saudi Arabia, since they belong to light units that
have no tanks at all. Due to a shortage of fast sealift, it
will be weeks before the U.S. can deploy heavy units of armor
and mechanized infantry, and even then it will be an open
question how far American quality can offset the large Iraqi
edge in numbers. Even if brought up to full strength before
shipping out, the three heavy divisions slated for Saudi
Arabia (the First Cavalry, Second Armored and 24th
Mechanized) would field fewer than 900 tanks. Marine
reinforcements could bring this up to 1,000. This would
account for more than half the total allied armor defending
Saudi Arabia.
   With control of the air, Saudi Arabia could be defended.
But to attack into Kuwait against a larger force with the
experience in defensive warfare that Iraq gained in the war
with Iran would be very bloody and the outcome would be in
doubt. The other allied forces would be of little help in
such an offensive campaign. Despite the U.N. diplomatic
cover, the U.S. would have to carry virtually the entire
burden of the fight just as it did in Korea.

   It is clear that the post-Cold War talk of maintaining
only a small "contingency" army of light troops was motivated
by political convenience rather than by strategic analysis.
That President Bush can still speak of a 25% reduction in
military manpower levels by 1995 indicates that the military
budget cutters remain in control despite the severe shortages
in troops, equipment and logistics revealed by the crisis.
   Iraq is not the only regional power filling its arsenals
with tanks, warplanes and missiles while pursuing chemical
and nuclear programs. If the U.S. is to remain a global
military power it needs larger, not smaller, conventional
forces. That means more heavy divisions, more tactical
fighter wings, more carrier battle groups and more
airlift/sealift capacity. It also will have to modernize its
forces to keep its edge in quality. Yet all of these programs
are to suffer substantial cuts. Saddam Hussein simply should
have waited a year or two. He would then only have had to
dodge a few diplomatic notes instead of face what may be the
last hurrah of the American military.
