   WASHINGTON -- Employers cannot unilaterally cut off
medical-insurance coverage for reservists called to Middle
East duty and their dependents, the Internal Revenue Service
ruled.
   The IRS said employers have the same obligation to
employees and their families during a military call-up as
they have when a worker is laid off or quits. Under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, a
departing employee may obtain continued health coverage from
the employer, usually for up to 18 months after he or she
leaves the job, by paying the full insurance premium.

   An employer may deny continued coverage to employees who
become covered under another group health plan. But the IRS
ruled that the medical coverage given military personnel, and
the coverage for their dependents under the military's
Champus health-benefits program, don't qualify as group
health plans under the tax code. The ruling upheld the
Defense Department's argument, although IRS officials
previously had leaned against that position.
   The call-up of reservists ordered by President Bush began
two weeks ago. Employers typically have 14 days from the day
a departed worker's regular medical coverage ends to notify
the employee of his right to continued health coverage.
Currently, most employers voluntarily are continuing medical
benefits for the reservists and their dependents under
existing terms of their plans, said Charles Kerby, a benefits
consultant with William M. Mercer Inc. in New York.
