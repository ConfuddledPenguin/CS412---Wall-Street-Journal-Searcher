   It isn't over yet in Alaska for Exxon Corp.
   Even as the giant oil company winds down its second summer
of scrubbing the beaches of Prince William Sound, site of the
largest oil spill in U.S. history, federal and state
officials are preparing to demand a third round of the
cleanup next year.

   "I'm 99% sure Exxon will have to do some additional work"
next summer, Coast Guard Adm. David Ciancaglini, the federal
government's on-scene coordinator, disclosed in an interview
over the weekend. And some Alaskan officials are unhappy,
saying a new slick appeared just Friday from oil washing off
one of the islands in the Gulf of Alaska.
   Scouring away more than 10 million gallons of crude oil
spilled when an Exxon tanker rammed an underwater reef in
March 1989 is proving to be one of the most costly and
time-consuming environmental cleanups ever. And as such, it
is becoming a vivid example of the enormous exposure faced by
any company transporting oil in U.S. waters.
   The Alaskan catastrophe already has prompted federal
legislation that, among other things, allows states to assess
unlimited liability for oil spills. In the wake of that, some
major oil companies and tanker operators have said they won't
send vessels into U.S. waters. Some shippers have been
devising ways to avoid open-ended liability by shifting the
ownership of cargoes. Others are trying to figure out how to
unload oil far from shore and may support construction of a
deep-water terminal 27 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The prospect that Exxon will have to return to Alaska next
summer comes as this year's cleanup effort is ending. Exxon
crews will have pulled out of Prince William Sound by
Saturday, as the onset of fall weather makes continued work
too risky. This summer's work has cost Exxon about $200
million, its senior management says; the company spent more
than $2 billion in the first-round cleanup in 1989. It's
unclear whether the latest costs are covered by charges Exxon
already has taken on its books.
   Despite the expenditures, enough oil from the huge spill
still taints the land to warrant the company's return,
several authorities say. During a recent visit to the sound,
Adm. J. William Kime, U.S. Coast Guard commandant, concluded
it would be impossible to eliminate the remaining oil this
summer, according to those traveling with him.
   Some of the 600 beaches treated the past few months will
need extra work, Adm. Kime told state and federal officials.
Adm. Ciancaglini, the on-scene coordinator, agrees. But Adm.
Ciancaglini, who has ultimate authority over the Alaskan
cleanup effort, said the nature of next year's work won't be
known until after a spring survey of the beaches.
   Exxon officials, in response to questions, say that they
will follow any directives given them by the Coast Guard. For
now, they say only that the company will participate in the
spring shoreline assessment next year.
   "In my opinion, there's probably not much else that can be
done" without the intrusion causing more environmental damage
than it would fix, Otto Harrison, head of the Exxon cleanup
team, said in an interview. "Very little, if anything, should
be needed after the winter storms" that usually rake the
sound.
   In fact, the question of whether an oil spill cleanup can
be overdone is one of the unexpected environmental issues to
emerge from the epic Alaskan case. Mr. Harrison said he is
basing his opinion in part on recommendations of three marine
biologists hired by Exxon to evaluate conditions in the
sound.
   "The sound is now clean enough for the natural recovery
process to begin; any further disturbance, such as additional
cleaning, would only delay recovery," contended Robert Clark,
one of the three biologists. "Some beaches were found with
oil still on them, but thriving biological communities
including fauna and fish life were living alongside the oil.
Most of that oil is nontoxic."
   Most scientific and government officials who have toured
the sound agree that little evidence of the spill remains on
the surface of the beaches.
   But oil trapped beneath the surface of beaches is a point
of contention between Exxon and state officials. As much as
80% of the subsurface oil remaining after the 1989 summer
effort was cleansed by winter storms, Exxon claims. Company
officials are banking on those violent storms, which send
huge waves crashing up on the shoreline, to again remove the
bulk of the remaining subsurface oil.
   Scientists with the federal National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration don't dispute last year's 80%
figure. But "there won't be 80% removal again this year,"
predicted John Robinson, an oil-spill specialist with the
agency who has spent much of this summer evaluating the
Alaskan spill.
   Though he agrees that disturbing some of the subsurface
oil might damage the environment further, he says flatly:
"Exxon should return next summer. There's no doubt there will
be some problems. It's counting too much on the winter" to
clear away remaining oil.
   Even Exxon's consultant, Mr. Clark, won't flatly say the
company shouldn't return. Though he regards the remaining oil
as nontoxic, he said he has noted on his visits "much
misapprehension" among Alaskans. "Local perception isn't
always in accord with scientific opinion," he said,
suggesting that whether Exxon returns will depend on a number
of factors, only one of which will be scientific data.
   Exxon, however, might deploy fewer people next year than
this year, and this year's contingent totaled a small
fraction of the summer 1989 workforce of almost 11,000.
During the past few months, about 1,000 people have worked on
the cleanup. Of that number, only about 150, working in
squads of 10 to 15 each, were actually manually cleaning the
beaches at any one time, Mr. Harrison estimated.
   State officials are most upset about the hidden oil. One
said he saw oil four feet below the surface only last
Thursday. Another described locations where an oil mousse,
typically 30% oil and 70% water, still bleeds to the surface
and hardens into tarlike mats. Similar mats formed last year
and were collected and hauled off in plastic bags this
summer.
   A beach can look clean because of wave action, said John
Bower of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation.
"But then you get out a shovel, dig down and you have pooled
oil conditions. Many areas hard hit last year still have
subsurface oil present."
   At least a dozen beaches will need additional mechanical
and manual cleanup next year, estimated Randolph Baylis,
onscene coordinator for the state Environmental Conservation
Department. As many as four dozen sites need more
bioremediation, a technique that enhances naturally existing
microbes that "eat" oil, he said.
   Exxon's Mr. Harrison called such projections "idle
speculation." He said he knows of only a few beaches where
oil is still seeping to the surface. Several were left
untreated last year for scientific reasons, and one was
simply missed. He conceded "some sheening" from a one-acre
submerged peat bog on Knight Island but maintained that oil
might seep there for several years.
   Like Exxon, the state cites a scientific study to buttress
its arguments. It took part in a joint project with Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute that it said showed marine life
continuing to react to even the small amounts of oil still in
the water. Exxon's Mr. Harrison disputed the state's
interpretation of the study.
   Such disagreements have at times become heated. Over the
weekend, verbal sparring broke out over work completed last
week by Exxon on the Barren Islands. The state wanted an
underground ribbon of oil discovered last month to be dug up
and hauled away. But the parties involved couldn't agree on
how much oil was actually there. Exxon and the Coast Guard
contended it was as little as 500 gallons; the state argued
it was at least 2,400.
   The state estimates infuriated the Coast Guard. Alaska's
environmental department "is just getting people whipped up,"
Adm. Ciancaglini charged. He suggested the state may be
trying to buttress a criminal suit it has filed against
Exxon.
   After finally getting approval from the state, workers
piled the oily material on top of a storm berm, high at the
back of the beach, where Exxon said it would be safe from
normal tides. Only violent storm waves would contact the
material, and they would quickly dissipate it, Exxon said.
   But during calm weather last Friday, according to Lee
Glenn, a state biologist, an unusually high tide washed as
much as a third of the oil into the water, creating "a slick
about 250 meters along the shore and 200 meters out into the
water." Adm. Ciancaglini and Don Carpenter, Exxon's
operations manager in the sound, visited foggy and rainy
Ushagat, the Barren Island in question, Saturday afternoon.
They didn't deny that a high tide might have reached the oily
mass at the back of the beach, but they said they didn't see
any slick.
