   Tokyo's Nikkei index finished higher Friday, bouncing up
strongly from its midday low in the afternoon session. An
announcement on a scheduled news conference about the Nikkei
index to be held later Friday prompted speculation that part
of the 225 issues included in the index might be replaced.
   Expectation that such a replacement would help reduce the
volatility of stock prices helped push up the index, traders
said.

   In London, share prices finished higher Friday and managed
to reverse early sharp losses by the closing bell, although
traders complained of low volume.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 150.16
points at 23962.07. The index lost 266.43 points Thursday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose
357.10 points to 24319.17.
   In Friday's trading, the broader-based Topix index
remained little changed, down 0.10 points, or 0.01%, to
1845.93 points. The Topix fell 14.05 points Thursday.
   Overall, declining shares outpaced advancing shares 567 to
388, while 141 shares remained unchanged.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 440 million
shares, down from 481 million shares Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the second section index, which lost 54.21
points Thursday, was down 45.07 points, or 1.25%, to close at
3,568.28.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at six million
shares, up from 5.4 million shares Thursday.
   Among rumors spread quickly on the market Friday afternoon
was that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fled to Libya, which
later proved unfounded.
   Futures indexes turned upward around the same time the
rumor was spread, helping push up stock prices. But observers
attributed the midday recovery of stock prices more to
technical factors than to the rumor.
   Yoshio Ogawa, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said a small number of investors and dealers
bought stocks in response to the rumor.
   "But as the Nikkei fell below 23,500 points {Friday
morning}, investors shared the perception that the market
deserves to see some rebound," he said.
   "To take profit whenever it's possible" was the stance
investors in general maintained, said a trader at Dai-Ichi
Securities, noting that institutional investors remained cool
to the rumor as they had been hurt when they bought on
unfounded Iraq rumors in the past.
   Sentiment was damped from the morning because of the
overnight plunge on Wall Street and a late surge of oil
prices, sending stock prices down midmorning.
   The Nikkei index declined as low as 23,405.71 points in
the morning session, marking its lowest level this year. The
level compares with the previous intraday low of 23,547.27
points posted Aug. 24 and the lowest daily close this year at
23,737.63, on Aug. 23.
   Traders predict the market will continue to see selling by
investors reducing positions.
   Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research at Nomura
Securities, said stock prices are under sell pressure due to
the market's internal factors.
   Such factors include approaching midyear book closings by
many financial institutions, as well as the expiration of the
September futures contract on Sept. 13, he said.
   Selling by institutions was increasingly noticeable
Friday, reflecting their concern about their midyear account
closings at the end of September, traders said.
   Due to growing expectation that the market is unlikely to
recover soon and help improve their performance, fund
managers were selling to avoid further losses, they said.
   An official at a life insurance company said his company's
separate account funds started to buy Friday. But many other
life insurance companies are still maintaining a selling
stance.
   Sell pressure is also expected to be strong next week as
many investors are likely to unwind their September futures
contracts ahead of the expiration, rather than rolling them
over to December.
   Nikkei Shimbun Inc. announced at a news conference late
Friday that the publisher of the economic daily compiling the
Nikkei index since 1949 will examine the possibility of
replacing some of the issues included in the index, which is
based on 225 selected stocks.
   The company said it will decide over the next two months
if such replacement or any other changes are necessary to
make the index reflect stock price changes more accurately.
   Ending higher Friday were high-technology shares, which
bounced up from their sharp losses on the previous day.
   Kyocera gained 260 yen ($1.85) to 7,350 yen, while TDK was
up 170 yen to 5,630 yen.
   On the other hand, Thursday's winners, such as gold mining
companies and Tokyu Group shares, fell back Friday on
profit-taking.
   Sumitomo Metal Mining declined 20 yen to 1,550 yen and
Mitsui Mining lost 39 yen to 921 yen.
   After poor overnight results from New York and Tokyo,
London opened easier. The release of U.S. unemployment
figures for August had little effect on Wall Street's
performance, which was led higher by the oil sector in the
wake of firmer spot crude prices. Traders said London's
turnaround in the closing hours of trading was largely due to
Wall Street's positive lead.
   "A lack of business has been the main problem," one trader
said. The highest volume levels Friday were recorded in the
third-line, lesser capitalized stocks.
   Speculation that the pound might enter the exchange-rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System over the weekend
was quashed early in the session, leaving inflation a
continuing concern for the U.K. economy and U.K. equity
investors, traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 2 points at 2,122.9, just under the day's high of 2,123,
and well above the low of 2,105.5 recorded at the opening of
trade.
   The narrower FT 30-share index closed down 1.4 points at
1,638.5, while total turnover amounted to a sketchy 331.8
million shares, lower than Thursday's 515.5 million shares,
but in line with recent levels.
   In the futures markets, the September FT-SE 100 index
closed at 2,135.5, up from Thursday's close of 2,123.
   Dealers said Kingfisher shares were rattled by rumors of a
possible downgrading. The stock finished off 11 pence (21
cents) to 307 pence.
   Boots, the pharmaceutical and consumer products company,
was hit by a rumor that the company had been asking analysts
to downgrade their profit forecasts, so as not to build up
false earnings expectations. The shares lost 5 pence to close
at 279.
   Water stocks had a strong day, performing as traditionally
defensive stocks, after a government announcement that
current high U.K. interest rates would remain for some time.
Northwest Water gained 4 pence to 218 while Thames Water rose
3 pence to 221.
   Britain's largest advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi lost
2 pence to close at 61, after announcing that it won't pay a
dividend for the time being.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris and Frankfurt;
mixed in Amsterdam, Brussels, and lower in Milan, Madrid and
Zurich. South African gold stocks closed narrowly mixed.
   Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, lower in
Singapore, Seoul and Wellington, mixed in Manila and little
changed in Sydney. Taipei was closed.
