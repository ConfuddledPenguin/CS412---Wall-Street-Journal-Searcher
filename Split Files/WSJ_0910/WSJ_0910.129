   TOKYO -- Three major Japanese steel companies separately
announced plans to raise dividends for the fiscal first half
ending Sept. 30. They cited expectations of higher sales
during the period, reflecting brisk domestic demand for crude
steel.
   The three steel concerns, Nippon Steel Corp., Kobe Steel
Ltd., and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., each plan to raise
the interim dividend payment to 3 yen (US two cents) from 2.5
yen a year earlier.

   Nippon Steel predicted, on an unconsolidated basis, that
it will post a rise in sales for the first half to 1.25
trillion yen (US$888.4 billion) yen from 1.238 trillion yen.
   Citing rising costs on fuel prices, as well as fierce
sales competition, Nippon Steel's pretax profit is estimated
at about 80 billion yen, down from 92.3 billion yen,
according to officials. However, the largest Japanese steel
maker said it expects drastic increases in both sales and
pretax income in the second half. The company didn't give
estimates.
   Kobe Steel forecast that it would post unconsolidated
sales of 640 billion yen, the highest half-year sales total
for the company, up from 602 billion yen the year before.
Pretax profit was flat at 28 billion yen, compared with 28.2
billion yen a year earlier.
   Sumitomo sees its sales reaching about 570 billion yen in
the first half from 544.2 billion yen the year before. The
company forecast its pretax profit registered about 40
billion yen, compared with 47.4 billion yen a year earlier.
