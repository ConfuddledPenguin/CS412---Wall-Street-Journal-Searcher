   Automated Arm-Twisting

   DEADBEATS beware. "Skip tracing" is becoming increasingly
automated.
   Some collection agencies are using personal computers to
search huge national databases of names and addresses such as
one owned by Metromail, a Lombard, Ill., unit of R.R.
Donnelley &amp; Sons. Others buy compact disks containing monthly
updates of phone directories from regional phone companies.
   One of the newest systems is SearchLink from Digital
Systems International, a Redmond, Wash., maker of automated
dialing equipment for collection agencies. If a bill
collector can't find the debtor at a phone number, or if the
phone is disconnected, SearchLink forwards the record to
Acolaid, a 104 million-name database owned by Computer
Graphics, Phoenix, Ariz.
   The Acolaid database, which includes information from
telephone directories, driver's license records and the
Postal Service's change-of-address files, first crosschecks
names and addresses to see if the information was wrong. It
automatically fixes phone numbers or ZIP codes that were
recorded incorrectly.
   If the information was right, the database can deliver the
name and phone number of as many as eight neighbors -- known
in the trade as nearbys. It can also list people with the
same surname in nearby ZIP code areas. They might be
relatives who would know where a debtor had skipped to.
   Neil Hanley, vice president of operations for JDR
Recovery, a Ramsey, N.J., collection agency, says he's using
the system to determine "how many nearbys it's necessary to
call -- is the guy across the street better to call than the
guy next door?"
                                                                                                       

   Wireless PC Networks
   Get a Jolt From NCR
                                                                                                       

   THE HIGH-TECH goal of tying computers together in networks
often founders on the low-tech problem of putting in wires,
which can cost $500 to $1,000 a PC in older buildings.
   A few firms have introduced wireless radio and infrared
networks to solve the problem, but they've been slow and
expensive.
   Today, NCR will unveil a wireless local area network, or
LAN, using radio waves that send data at two million bits a
second, one-fifth the rate of wire networks, but nine times
as fast as previous wireless LANs. NCR's product, WaveLAN,
costs $1,390, more than twice as much as network cards that
let computers connect to wires, but users avoid cabling.
   Cees Links, WaveLAN product manager at NCR, Dayton, Ohio,
says the system will be marketed initially to companies that
frequently move PCs around. He says retailers who add
point-of-sale terminals for holiday sales are interested in
buying systems.
   Bankers also are showing interest in WaveLAN for old
branches, in part because a bank's own computer experts can
install a wireless LAN, while cabling requires outside
contractors. "Banks don't want anyone but their own people to
install networks, because they're so security-conscious,"
says Mr. Links.
                                                                                                       

   Hard Disks at the Office
   Aren't Private Anymore
                                                                                                       

   PCS on networks are likely to become less personal.
   XTree, a San Luis Obispo, Calif., software company,
recently introduced a software program that lets network
administrators read files stored on hard disks in users'
computers.
   Michael Chuises, XTree's product manager, says the main
purpose of the feature is to make it easy for a network
manager to make sure that hundreds of PC users are all using
the same version of WordPerfect or to check whether users are
making regular backups of their disks.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Chuises concedes, "it's controversial."
A manager can search files on the hard disk even while the
user is working, he says. "It's as if someone was rummaging
through your desk drawers while you were working on the desk
top."
   Many PC users treat their hard disks as private storage
areas. But with managers capable of snooping around, users
may think twice about storing resumes or Internal Revenue
Service correspondence on company PCs.
   Mary Modahl, who studies networks for Forrester Research,
a Cambridge, Mass., research firm, says that with the XTree
product, "Basically, privacy goes out the window. But if
you're a large company and you're paying for the computers,
how much privacy do you want them to have?"
                                                                                                       

   Translating 1,000 Words
   Into a Simple Diagram
                                                                                                       

   ALLCLEAR, a new program from Clear Software Inc.,
Brookline, Mass., can turn 1,000 words into a picture.
   The $300 program, billed as an "automatic idea
illustrator," has excited industry gurus. Its creator,
Russian emigre Vadim Yasinovsky, "has both a hot product and
a metaphor that will become an important contribution to
software design," says Jeff Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter,
a Watertown, Mass., newsletter.
   Using AllClear, a person can type a list of instructions
or a description of an organization, and AllClear will
automatically turn it into a chart with boxes and arrows
showing connections and relationships. Among 100 examples
diagrammed in AllClear's manual are procedures for
programming a videocassette recorder, diagnosing a car and
determining insurance coverage for a patient.
   There are already a variety of software programs that help
draw charts. But AllClear does it automatically with a simple
eightword language that shows how one item is related to the
next. For instance, a statement followed by a question mark
creates a diagram with two branches, one for "yes," one for
"no." A statement followed by a colon allows a number of
different paths.
