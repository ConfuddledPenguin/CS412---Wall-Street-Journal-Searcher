   ATHENS, Greece -- When Greece dispatched one of its naval
frigates this week to boost the multinational military
presence near the Persian Gulf, its first stop was at another
victim of aggression the Greeks haven't forgotten -- Cyprus.
   As a strong U.S.-led military countermove responded to the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, many Greeks recalled that no such
help was forthcoming when Turkey invaded tiny Cyprus in July
1974.

   The Greek media and public opinion have been drawing the
inevitable cynical conclusion. "No one did anything when
Turkey invaded Cyprus, simply because Cyprus has no oil,"
said radio journalist Nasos Athanasiou.
   Turkish forces still are in control of northern Cyprus,
which proclaimed itself a breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in
1983. The partition has been a source of Greek-Turkish
friction for 16 years.
   The frigate Limnos, one of the newest ships in Greece's
80-vessel navy, was set to move on from Cyprus to patrol duty
in the eastern Mediterranean. Nonetheless, the Turkish
Cypriot leadership has been quick to resent what it sees as
Greece's exercise in gunboat diplomacy.
   Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, self-styled
president of the breakaway state, said the presence of the
Limnos in a Cypriot port is "dangerous" and could result in
Turkish naval countermoves.
   "Nonsense," scoffs the Cypriot ambassador to Athens,
Frixos Colotas. "Fifty thousand fully armed Turkish troops
have been in Cyprus for 16 years. What are we to say to
that?"
   A Greek government spokesman said Athens "does not reply
to private persons," a reference to Mr. Denktash's lack of
official recognition by any country except Turkey.
   The present preoccupation with the Gulf crisis has put the
lingering Cyprus issue on the back burner for now. Greek
officials and commentators, however, said they hope the
lesson that aggression doesn't pay won't be lost on Ankara
after the present crisis has passed.
   "The {diplomatic} isolation of Turkey has not ceased with
the Gulf crisis," Greek Foreign Minister Antonios Samaras
said in a recent interview with the newspaper Kathimerini.
"The events in the Gulf favor prospects for solving the
Cyprus problem."
   Added Mr. Colotas: "The Gulf crisis, if properly handled,
will also benefit our cause."
   But no one seems to know just how. Athens maintains that
Ankara shows no willingness to pull its occupation forces out
of northern Cyprus. President Bush and other world leaders
have said repeatedly that the Greek-Cypriot and
Turkish-Cypriot communities on the island must work out their
differences themselves.
   Most Greeks agree that Greece had to show solidarity with
the forces arrayed against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. "A lack of
cooperation would further turn the resources of the world's
powerful toward Turkey," said political columnist Constantine
Kalligas, noting that the anti-Western stance of the Greek
socialist government during most of the 1980s did not endear
Athens to Washington.
   "Right now it would not be appropriate to push the Cyprus
issue," said Mr. Colotas. "The big powers now need Turkey."
   But later? "We could demand, on faultless moral amd
political grounds, the enforcement of the United Nations
resolutions on Cyprus," said Mr. Kalligas. Three U.N.
resolutions, issued between 1974 and 1983, have called on
Turkey to pull its forces out of Cyprus.
   The voyage of the Limnos, however, could be a stronger
hint. Seeing off the ship's crew at the naval base at Salamis
(where a Greek fleet trounced the Persians in 480 B.C.),
Greek Defense Minister Ioannis Varvitsiotis said Greece "has
the right to demand the same solidarity from the world
community."
