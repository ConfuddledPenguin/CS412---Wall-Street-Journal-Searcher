   BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- Bethlehem Steel Corp., threatening to
shutter its troubled rod and wire division, said it wants to
renegotiate a costly labor agreement it signed last year.
   In exchange for labor concessions, Bethlehem, the nation's
No. 2 steel concern, said it would invest more than $100
million to modernize facilities at the division's three
sites, in Johnstown, Pa.; Lackawanna, N.Y., and Sparrows
Point, Md. The division, which has estimated annual revenue
of about $450 million, has been unprofitable every year since
it opened in 1983.

   The United Steelworkers union had no immediate response to
the company's call for a new labor agreement. But the union
and its 2,700 employees in Bethlehem's bar, rod and wire
division may have no choice but to negotiate. If labor balks
at Bethlehem's call, "there would be the risk of shutting it
down entirely," a company spokesman said.
   Whether the union will make concessions, a spokesman for
USW Local 2635 in Johnstown said, "depends on how many
carrots are out there."
   The 50-month agreement, signed in May 1989, boosted wages
and benefits an estimated 20%, following five years of
reduced labor costs. Company officials, competitors and
industry analysts agree that Bethlehem now suffers from a
competitive disadvantage from both labor costs and outdated
equipment.
   Bethlehem declined to name specific concessions it would
seek from the union. But analysts said it is likely to seek
cuts in both wages and the work force, and better labor
productivity. Labor, in return, will probably seek job
security and, for terminated employees, improved
compensation.
   In seeking the renegotiation, Bethlehem is acknowledging
that it cannot support the costs of the current contract,
which saddled the company with some of the highest labor
costs in the industry. But the company spokesman indicated
that the company had anticipated possible problems when it
included a renegotiation clause in the contract.
   Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities, said
Bethlehem's per-hour employee costs total $28, including high
pension costs. The industry average is $26, he said, and the
Bethlehem division's minimill competitors are paying in "the
middle teens."
   The outdated equipment in the mills has kept the
division's productivity at five man-hours to produce each ton
of steel, against an industry average of about three
man-hours, the analyst added.
   The capital improvements will include a continuous caster,
which eliminates several laborious and costly steps in
steelmaking, as well as the modernization of an existing bar
mill. Analyst John Tumazos, of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
said Bethlehem's offer to invest $100 million is something it
had to do anyway to match the modernization plans of
competitors.
