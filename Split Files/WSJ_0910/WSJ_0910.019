   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's Reemtsma
Cigarettenfabrieken G.m.b.H. said it acquired East Germany's
largest cigarette maker, Nortrak G.m.b.H., formerly the
state-owned VEB Tabak Nordhausen.
   Reemtsma said Nortrak sold 10 billion cigarettes in 1989
and controlled a third of the East German cigarette market.
The company has 1,000 employees.

   Reemtsma is 51% family owned, with 49% held by
Hamburg-based coffee maker Tchibo Frisch-Roest-Kaffee AG,
which in turn is wholly owned by the Herz family of West
Germany.
