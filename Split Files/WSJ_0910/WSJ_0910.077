   LONDON -- One more dose of bad news for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Co. shouldn't hurt, but it did.
   Friday's announcement that the battered advertising
giant's balance sheet was too weak to pay a regular dividend
sent Saatchi shares tumbling. Although the company had warned
shareholders this year that the dividend might be sacrificed
in a campaign to shore up the company's capital position,
shareholders unloaded their holdings, immediately driving the
share price down 18 pence (34 cents) to 45 pence a share. The
stock rebounded slightly, ending the day on London's Stock
Exchange at 52 pence, down 11 pence from the previous day's
close.

   "They do have an ability to slip on banana skins
repeatedly," said Neil Blackley, an analyst with James Capel
Securities in London. The decision to scuttle the dividend
follows a depressing drumbeat of bad news for the
once-expansive advertising and communications company:
divestitures under pressure, salary cuts and reorganizations,
and defections of top advertising managers.
   In June, the company reported a #7 million ($13.4 million)
net loss for its fiscal first half and skipped its interim
dividend. At the time, Chief Executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus
said that he considerd it "more important to reduce our debt
than pay our dividend."
   But while it's unpopular for a company to scrap its
dividend, shareholders may have overreacted at first.
Saatchi's move was forced more by accounting rules than by
any new negative developments. In unloading two of its
subsidiaries at disappointing prices, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
absorbed a #40 million loss on the parent company's balance
sheet. That left the company short of the reserves necessary
to pay the regular dividend.
   The company described the problem as a "technical
situation," adding that it could have paid the dividend after
winning special permission from bond holders, a move it
considered imprudent. Saatchi also said it will restore the
dividend "once the present technical position is corrected."
Analysts doubt this will come before some time next year.
   The write-offs stem from sales of Peterson &amp; Co., a
litigation support concern, and Hay Co., a consulting firm.
Having paid #42 million for Peterson in 1987, Saatchi
received only #1.2 million for it in a buy-out by its
managers. Saatchi sold Hay to a group of its managers and
outside investors for $90 million. It bought the consultancy
in 1985 for an undisclosed sum.
   The write-offs that forced the dividend cancellation don't
include losses expected from the sale of Gartner Group Inc.,
which is being sold to an investor group for $55 million in
cash and $15 million in notes and other obligations. Saatchi
acquired this subsidiary two years ago for $86 million.
   The announcement comes as Saatchi is negotiating to sell a
number of its non-core advertising businesses in the U.S.
Moving far beyond its original intentions to sell only the
consulting businesses, the company now is expected to sell
some of its smaller ad units and focus on its major ad
networks.
   As previously reported, Saatchi's plan to sell its
McCaffrey &amp; McCall ad agency back to senior management is
expected to be closed by the end of the month. Saatchi also
has been in discussions to sell its small Siegel &amp; Gale
design group back to management. And industry executives
believe Saatchi would be interested in selling its AC&amp;R
Advertising unit and a chunk of its Howard Marlboro Group,
although executives at those companies deny such speculation.
   "Markets don't like companies cutting dividends, but in
some ways, this is good news," said Mark Sheppard, analyst
with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. "They're saving some
money."
   It's estimated that Saatchi's decision will save the
company about #6 million pounds a year.
   "I don't think there's any further bad news," said a
former Saatchi executive in London. But he and others note
that the deteriorating economic climate in the U.S. and
Britain will make the difficult times worse.
   "They're operating against a backdrop of a sector that's
being written off by the market," said one advertising
executive. August, traditionally a weak month for the
advertising industry, was considerably worse than normal this
year, with the Gulf crisis pushing up oil prices and stoking
fears of a recession.
   Analysts say Saatchi may be able to halve its rental
expenses in London by moving to the huge Canary Wharf office
development on the Thames, a massive development still hungry
for clients. Another possibility for raising cash is the
continued sale of art treasures Saatchi has acquired over the
last decade. Even after whittling down the collection
considerably, remaining Saatchi art works are estimated to be
worth about $30 million.
