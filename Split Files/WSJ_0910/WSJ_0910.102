   Sam Armacost could stand it no longer. From the purgatory
of his offices at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the man who
had once run the Bank of America watched as A.W. "Tom"
Clausen grabbed the lion's share of credit for what is
arguably the greatest banking recovery of all time.
   Though Mr. Armacost had been fired as B of A's chief
executive officer after a disastrous series of losses, he
also had engineered the bank's revival, recruiting several
key executives from rival Wells Fargo and cutting costs.

   Giving vent to his frustration, according to Moira
Johnston's "Roller Coaster: The Bank of America and the
Future of American Banking" (Ticknor &amp; Fields, 417 pages,
$22.95), Mr. Armacost picked up the phone and called Ron
Rhody, B of A's chief public relations man.
   "Hey, Ron," Mr. Armacost told his former subordinate, "I'm
partly amused and partly annoyed. You know what we
accomplished . . . We brought the expense line down to zero."
   No longer content to suffer in silence, Mr. Armacost
finally agreed to talk at length with Ms. Johnston about the
turbulence that shook B of A to its foundations. So in this
book we read how he rid the bank of weak managers who had
been put there by Mr. Clausen before he retired in 1981 to
run the World Bank (only to return after Mr. Armacost's
downfall). Breaking with tradition and going outside
"MotherBank," Mr. Armacost hired executives who could operate
in banking's tough new world of deregulation. He purchased
discount broker Charles Schwab &amp; Co. as well as Seafirst Bank
in Seattle as part of a diversification drive.
   Later, when the bank languished under enormous loan
losses, it was the Armacost team that fired thousands of
workers. Tom Cooper, the chief operating officer Mr. Armacost
lured to B of A to help with the recovery, led this
housecleaning. Mr. Armacost's plan called for 1988 earnings
of $711 million; the bank actually earned $726 million. But
by then Mr. Clausen was back running the show.
   To Ms. Johnston's credit, "Roller Coaster" does not become
a big soapbox for Sam Armacost. Instead, the author
reconstructs many of the mistakes that contributed to his
ouster. She suggests that his greatest error was, ironically,
his loyalty to Tom Clausen and the Bank of America heritage.
Rather than take huge loan losses early and start with a
clean slate of managers, Mr. Armacost decided to move more
cautiously and to build a consensus within the wounded giant.
   "Roller Coaster" pulls no punches when it comes to Tom
Clausen. The man who ran B of A in the 1970s, making it the
world's most profitable bank, and who reemerged as its savior
in the late 1980s, is convincingly portrayed as a
coldblooded, profoundly insecure autocrat who sought size and
profits to assuage his lack of self-confidence.
   A seasoned journalist and author, most notably of
"Takeover: The New Wall Street Warriors," Ms. Johnston finds
her stride quickly and writes with a crisp narrative style.
She is at her best in painting psychological portraits and
re-creating the sweeping panorama of international events
that affected American banking: inflation, petrodollar
lending, the collapse of energy prices and Third World debt.
   Unfortunately, "Roller Coaster" offers few facts to
advance it beyond the territory claimed by Gary Hector in
"Breaking the Bank: The Decline of BankAmerica" (Little,
Brown), which appeared two years ago and now is available in
paperback. Did Ms. Johnston read "Breaking the Bank" before
embarking on her own treatise? Mr. Hector's book is not even
listed in the bibliography.
   Ignoring the Hector book was a mistake, for "Roller
Coaster" covers much of the same material: Mr. Clausen's rude
firing of Al Rice, vice-chairman of the bank; Chuck Schwab's
showdown with Mr. Armacost; the numerous management meetings
with consultant Ichak Adizes; the attempts by First
Interstate and Sandy Weil to acquire Bank of America; and,
finally, Mr. Armacost's departure.
   For his part, Mr. Hector is tough on both Mr. Clausen and
Mr. Armacost, portraying the latter as a smooth salesman who
kept his board members in the dark and who was seen golfing
when he should have been redoubling his efforts at the bank.
He profiles Mr. Clausen as a humorless executive who suffered
a "charisma bypass."
   Unlike "Roller Coaster," "Breaking the Bank" did not have
on-the-record quotations from Chairman Armacost. However, Mr.
Hector did talk with the former CEO's allies, and he provides
a convincing and highly detailed picture of corporate
intrigue and the board machinations.
   Since "Roller Coaster" appears two years after "Breaking
the Bank," it seems only fair to state that Ms. Johnston
should have put her talent to use explaining how Tom Clausen
and the new B of A executives built on Mr. Armacost's mixed
legacy. In other words, Ms. Johnston should have devoted more
space to recounting the detail of a turnaround that brought B
of A back to the front ranks of American Banking rather than
restate the events that led to its downfall.
