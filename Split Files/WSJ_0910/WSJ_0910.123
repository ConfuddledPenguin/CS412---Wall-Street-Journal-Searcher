   Intermark Inc., which recently completed a merger with
Triton Group Ltd., said the companies' boards approved a
settlement of shareholder litigation related to the merger.
   Several suits, consolidated in the Delaware Chancery
Court, had charged the companies' officers with breaches of
various fiduciary duties. Intermark and Triton said they
agreed to the settlement without admitting any wrongful acts.

   Under the settlement, which requires court approval,
Intermark conditionally agreed to pay as much as 35 cents a
share for each Triton share held by former Triton holders who
received Intermark stock in the merger and hold it for two
years after court approval.
   Intermark said that such additional payment, if any, is
dependent upon the trading price of Intermark common shares.
No settlement amount will be paid if at any time during the
two-year period, the closing price of Intermark shares equals
or exceeds $6.375 on 20 consecutive trading days.
   If the average closing price of Intermark common stock for
the 20 trading days preceding the two-year anniversary is
less than $5.50 per share, Intermark will pay up to 35 cents
a share in cash, or an equivalent value in stock.
   Intermark shares closed Friday at $4.50, down 12.5 cents,
in American Stock Exchange trading.
