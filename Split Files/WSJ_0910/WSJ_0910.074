   Yesterday's united Persian Gulf stand by Presidents Bush
and Gorbachev was dramatic and historically important. But
one point deserves close attention. For the first time since
World War II, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are making common
cause against a troublemaker who styles himself a
"socialist." Some Soviets may not find that palatable.
   U.S. objectives when the crisis broke were clear. It
wanted Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and out of power, and a
permanent military presence in the gulf region to guarantee
future stability. Yesterday, Mr. Bush promised Mr. Gorbachev
that the U.S. would withdraw when the Saudis are secure and
there are "regional" security arrangements.

   That is a slight softening, so it would appear, of initial
U.S. thoughts of keeping forces in the region. Mr. Bush had
then lost patience with attempts to come to terms with Arab
socialism and what it has spawned these last 40 years. That
includes Arab belligerence, vicious and wide-ranging bands of
terrorists and, at times, brutal tyrannies towards dissenters
in the nations under Arab socialist control.
   Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt was the standard bearer of
Arab socialism in the late 1950s and 1960s, when his Arab
Socialist Union came into being. As with Saddam, he too
wanted to unite the Arab world under a single banner. To that
end, he conducted a short-lived merger with Syria, employed
an extensive secret service in Arab countries, supported wars
in Yemen and Algeria, gave the Soviet Union a foothold in the
Middle East and fought the Six-Day War with Israel, which
cost him and his principal allies, Syria and Jordan, dearly.
His principal heirs today are Saddam Hussein and Hafez al
Assad of Syria -- with their separate Ba'ath parties -- and
Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization. They
too have seen, and caused, more than their share of trouble
and bloodshed. Egypt, under Anwar Sadat and then under Hosni
Mubarak, has distanced itself from militant Arab socialists
and moved closer to the U.S. and the West.
   This history does not lack relevance to the efforts by Mr.
Bush and Mr. Gorbachev to find a common ground in dealing
with Saddam Hussein. If their efforts go forward, it will be
the first time that the Soviet Union has joined with the West
in punishing one of its own proteges. For years, the Soviets
saw Arab socialism as their passkey to important influence in
the Middle East. That hope was still alive just before Saddam
Hussein sent his tanks rolling into Kuwait on August 2. It
cannot be certain that the hope is dead even now among the
generals and KGB operatives who have worked so long and hard
to establish Soviet influence over Syria, Iraq and the PLO.
Mr. Bush acknowledged yesterday that he and Mr. Gorbachev had
some differences over use of military force against Saddam.
   When Saddam dispatched his foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
to Moscow last week he no doubt hoped to dissuade Mr.
Gorbachev from siding with Iraq's enemies, even though the
Soviet leader already had condemned the rape of Kuwait.
Surely, Saddam must have thought, socialist solidarity still
has meaning.
   But Saddam's problem is that both socialist solidarity and
socialism itself are rapidly disappearing, and particularly
in the Soviet Union. Members of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union are resigning in droves. Mr. Gorbachev still
heads the party but quite likely is coming to regard it as
more of a political liability than an asset. Under new,
nationalistic parties, the separate republics are taking
power into their own hands.
   Quite possibly, Mr. Gorbachev has decided that the Arab
socialists are a liability as well. They have never been an
especially tractable bunch. Someone in Moscow put out the
story that Mr. Gorbachev was furious about Saddam's
unilateral decision to invade. That, so it was said, was why
the Soviets were so willing to condemn the invasion and
demand Iraqi withdrawal.
   That story may possibly be true. Yet another possibility
is that Mr. Gorbachev knew the attack was coming but made no
attempt to stop it. A sharp rise in the price of oil has been
beneficial to the Soviet Union, which exports oil and is
desperate for foreign exchange. There was a chance the West
would not react and, since the arrogant Saddam was taking all
the risks, why interfere? Mr. Gorbachev had good reasons --
his hopes for western economic aid -- for condemning the
attack after he realized that Mr. Bush was furious. But had
the attack not happened, he would have had less bargaining
power than he has now. There is a word for such tactics,
duplicity. But then even Mikhail Gorbachev hasn't yet earned
his Eagle Scout badge.
   The final and most interesting possibility is that the
Soviet generals who work closely with Saddam knew or
suspected that he was planning to make a move but didn't
bother to inform Mr. Gorbachev. Anonymous U.S. intelligence
sources have been quoted as saying it would have been
impossible for Saddam to have launched the attack without
prior knowledge of either his Soviet military advisers, who
number over 1,000, or the KGB, which has a pervasive presence
in Iraq. If Mr. Gorbachev was not warned, he had good cause
for anger.
   It also would suggest a deepening split between the Soviet
President and some elements of the Soviet military and state
security elites (KGB). Soviet foreign ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov last week dismissed a suggestion by a
Soviet military commander that an outbreak of hostilities
over Kuwait might damage East-West relations. Yet, Mr.
Gorbachev has not fully countermanded original assertions by
his military that its advisers in Iraq, who help operate
Saddam's electronic air defense equipment, would stay put. Is
Mr. Gorbachev prepared to support an air strike against his
own radar technicians? In Helsinki, he suggested he would
remove "some" advisers, but that presumably means not all.
   As with so much in the Soviet Union these days, there can
be no certainty that anyone will salute when the President
gives an order. The KGB, after all, has been the "sword and
shield" of the Communist Party -- not the Soviet state --
throughout its history. The Soviet military also has been
under party control. The party remains a hard-liner
stronghold.
   If Mr. Gorbachev gets static from the military and the KGB
over the course he is following towards their important
client, the present U.S.-Soviet unity could be in jeopardy.
At some point, it might even force him to choose between the
riches of the West and what remains of socialist solidarity.
It is something that Mr. Bush and his advisers will want to
watch closely.
