   DALLAS -- Uranium Resources Inc. said a subsidiary signed
a long-term contract with a major U.S. electric utility to
provide about 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide in the
1992-1997 period.
   The uranium mining company estimated the value of the
contract at $20 million, based on projections of deliveries
and price escalations. The company declined to name the
utility.
