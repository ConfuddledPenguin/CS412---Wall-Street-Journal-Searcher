   NEW YORK -- The so-called value investors in small stocks
are walking taller these days, but not because they are
suddenly making a ton of money by feeding their customary
appetite for low-priced shares.
   The value crowd is regaining lost ground simply because
the recent slippage in its already battered portfolios pales
in comparison with the broader plunge in small stocks as a
group.

   For instance, the value-oriented Babson Enterprise Fund of
Boston, managed by Peter Schliemann, fell 10.5% through Aug.
31. That compares with a 17% decline in the Russell 2000.
   The current market might seem a bargain hunter's dream,
now that over-the-counter shares are languishing at their
lowest levels in 20 months. Yet the value investors aren't in
any rush to proclaim the market rife with bargains, even
though their basic stock picking strategy starts with the
notion that cheaper is better.
   "Small stocks as a homogenous group are dead," says Scott
M. Black, president of Delphi Management Inc., also of
Boston. "Most of them don't have sustainable earnings power."
   Many stars of the OTC market such as Microsoft and Apple
Computer have long since joined the ranks of larger stocks,
he says. Others that grew rapidly have been acquired. "Many
that are left are junk," says Mr. Black, who invests about
one-third of his $750 million fund in OTC stocks. His fund
declined 10.5% through Aug. 31.
   Of course, some small shares may be jewels, he says,
adding that investors hoping for big gains must be patient.
Value investors such as Messrs. Black and Schliemann don't
seek immediate gratification. They hold the stocks in their
portfolios an average of four years or longer.
   They also largely eschew such glamorous sectors as
technology, where fast-growing companies can fall as rapidly
as they rise. For instance, after a recent visit to Silicon
Valley, Mr. Black concluded that none of the technology
companies he visited had sufficient earnings potential to
justify investing in their pricey shares.
   Mr. Schliemann finds allure in such mundane products as
the railroad-car bearings made by Brenco of Petersburg, Va.
Founded in the 1940s, Brenco shares a secure market for
railroad-car bearings with Timken Co. With the nation's
railroad fleet aging, Mr. Schliemann is expecting Brenco to
benefit as more cars are refurbished or replaced.
   Brenco meets many of his investment criteria: it is
obscure, it makes a strong, specialized product and it has a
sustainable competitive advantage and its earnings growth
prospects are above average.
   Mr. Schliemann also likes companies that have recently
stumbled but whose prospects are solid. In 1989, Brenco's 40%
growth in sales was offset by a $2.6 million reserve for
environmental cleanup costs. But per-share earnings are
expected to grow to 55 cents in 1990 and 69 cents in 1991
from 31 cents in 1989. At Friday's close of $6, the stock is
trading near its 52-week low of 5 3/4 and well below its high
of 10 1/4.
   Brenco's shares trade at about 1.5 times book value, well
below the average 2.2 price-to-book ratio of shares in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, a situation that also attracts
Mr. Schliemann. The company has more than 25% of its stock
held by insiders, which suits his preference for companies
with relatively large inside ownership. The average market
value of companies in Mr. Schliemann's fund is $110 million.
   For Mr. Black, insurance stocks have become appealing --
at least those of well-disciplined companies that don't let
expenses and claims get out of hand.
   Mr. Black recently has been adding to his positions in
United Fire &amp; Casualty of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; W.R. Berkley of
Greenwich, Conn.; and Safeco of Seattle.
   Mr. Black expects insurance premiums to firm next year. In
his hunt for good values, he seeks insurers whose combined
claims and expenses don't exceed their income from premiums.
"I look for companies with underwriting discipline," he
explains.
   As part of his overall strategy, Mr. Black hunts for
companies with above-average returns on equity and relatively
low price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. At 33 1/4,
United Fire &amp; Casualty is selling near its 1989 book value of
about $32; at 29, Safeco is trading right at its 1989 book
value. At about 34, Berkley is trading above its 1989 book
value of about $24 but well below its 52-week high of 46 1/2.
All three stocks sell for roughly 6.5 times estimated 1991
earnings.
   Greeting-card stocks also have been given a warm welcome
by Mr. Black. He has been buying shares of American Greetings
of Cleveland and Gibson Greetings of Cincinnati, among the
nation's largest makers of greeting cards. Mr. Black says he
believes the price wars of 1987 are over and expects both
companies to benefit from higher prices, distribution through
such large outlets as Wal-Mart Stores, and strong business
even during a recession. Both stocks trade at less than 10
times their estimated 1991 earnings.
   Mr. Schliemann is banking on his expectation that
Americans will always buy toys for their children and
relatives. He has been buying shares of Value Merchants, a
Milwaukee toy wholesaler that has entered the retail market
with closeout stores situated largely in outlet malls. At 10
3/8, the stock is trading at seven times estimated earnings
for the fiscal year ending in January 1992. Value Merchants
may be a particularly good value if there is a recession, he
adds. "You can argue that because they're a discount store,
they will do better than other, full-priced toy outlets."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The over-the-counter market ended the four-day Labor Day
week slightly lower than where it began.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.60 Friday to 380.38, a
0.4% increase, but the index posted a 0.8% loss for the week.
Volume rose to 103.2 million shares from 98.7 million shares
Thursday. Advancers led decliners, 967 to 797, while 2,496
shares remained unchanged.
   Oracle Systems tumbled 1 3/4 to 8 1/8 on more than 9.9
million shares. The Redwood City, Calif., software maker said
Friday that it expects to report a loss of 20 cents a share
for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with
year-earlier net income of nine cents a share. The quarterly
loss is the first in the company's history. Analysts had
expected a small profit for the quarter. Citing the slow
economy, Oracle also slashed its expected revenue growth for
the year to 25% from 50%.
   Other technology stocks were mixed. Intel rose 1/2 to 31
3/4 on more than four million shares; Sun Microsystems added
1/8 to 28 3/8; Microsoft gained 1/4 to 57 3/4; Apple Computer
advanced 5/8 to 36 3/8; but Conner Peripherals eased 1/8 to
22 1/4.
   Genetics Institute slipped 1 1/4 to 31 1/4 on nearly 1.2
million shares. A spokeswoman told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that a 521,300-share block apparently was
sold by Baxter International Inc., which previously said it
planned to sell all or part of its 7% stake in the Cambridge,
Mass., biotechnology company.
