   Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. said it will increase prices
for its original-equipment commercial tires by 5%, effective
Oct. 1.
   The Akron, Ohio, company, a unit of Groupe Michelin of
France, attributed the move to "the escalating cost of raw
materials." The increase follows a 2% to 6% increase on tire
prices, also effective Oct. 1, announced by Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co.

   The price increases had been expected because of the rise
in crude-oil prices stemming from the Mideast crisis.
