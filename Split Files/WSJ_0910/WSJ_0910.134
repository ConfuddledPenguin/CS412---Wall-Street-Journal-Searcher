   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A state court judge slashed to $3.5
million from $17.5 million an award of damages against Syntex
Corp. for wrongful discharge of a scientist.
   Judge Thomas P. Hansen of Superior Court for Santa Clara
County termed "grossly excessive" a prior jury decision to
award former Syntex scientist Gabriel Garay $2.5 million in
compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages
levied against the Palo Alto, Calif., drug company.

   Mr. Garay left Syntex after protesting the company's
suppression of information about possible toxic side-effects
of an anti-ulcer drug. James Der, attorney for the plaintiff,
said he was "disappointed" by the judge's decision to shave
the award.
   He said his client has until Sept. 20 to decide whether he
will accept the reduced damages. However, Mr. Der emphasized
that the judge refused to overturn the verdict of wrongful
discharge of Mr. Garay.
   If the reduced award isn't accepted by either side, the
judge said the case may go to a new trial on damages only.
Syntex officials had no immediate comment on whether they
would appeal the reduced award.
