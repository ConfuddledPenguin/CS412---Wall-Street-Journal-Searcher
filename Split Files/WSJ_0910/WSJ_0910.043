   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Justin Industries Inc., stung by
charges that its directors secretly made it more difficult
for shareholders to remove them, said the board has now
reversed itself.
   The surprise move appears to strengthen the hand of a
dissident shareholder group trying to acquire the brick,
building materials and boot maker. It also could make it more
difficult for Justin to complete a planned acquisition of
Tony Lama Co., an El Paso, Texas boot maker, for about $18
million plus the assumption of about $34 million in debt.

   The controversy arose from a vote by the Justin board to
raise the number of shareholders' votes needed to remove
directors to 75% of total shares outstanding from 50% of the
stock voted by a quorum of shareholders. Although the
amendment passed in November 1989, the company failed to make
the change public until last month, according to the
dissident group, which is led by Perry H. Sutherland of
Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York.
   In a motion in federal court here last week, the group
sought the court's permission to file a complaint claiming
that Justin violated federal securities laws.
   In the proposed complaint, the group seeks, among other
things, for the court to void the election of Justin
shareholders in the annual meeting last March; to enjoin the
directors from proceeding with the planned acquisition of
Tony Lama; and to order the company and its directors to pay
actual and punitive damages.
   Justin, in response, said it "vehemently disagrees" that
it committed any wrongdoing and said it plans to "vigorously"
contest the legal claims. But it added that its board
rescinded its November vote anyway because it "wishes to
avoid any appearance of unfairness to any of its
shareholders."
   Neither the company, nor a representative of the dissident
group, which owns 12% of Justin's common, would comment
further.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Justin shares closed
unchanged at $13.75. Tony Lama closed at $8.50, up 12.5
cents.
