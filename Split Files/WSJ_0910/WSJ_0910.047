   WASHINGTON -- If a silver lining emerges in the current
Persian Gulf crisis, U.S. officials hope it is this: Egypt,
Syria and Saudi Arabia will team up in a long-term coalition
with the U.S. to stabilize the region.
   But such a partnership may prove to be more of an illusion
than reality.

   Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, three powerhouses of the
Arab world, have formed a marriage of convenience for now.
Several thousand Egyptian and Syrian troops are in Saudi
Arabia with U.S. forces and talks are under way over the
dispatch of tens of thousands more.
   Yet the three nations have such different systems and such
divergent motives in the conflict over Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, that serious doubt exists about whether they can mesh
in the long run. Beyond their objection to Iraqi
expansionism, it isn't clear what unites them.
   A potential alliance among the three "is the kind of an
idea that you float and you see where it goes," says Nicholas
Veliotes, formerly the State Department's top Middle East
diplomat. Adds a senior administration Gulf policy maker: "A
lot depends on what the continuing threat looks like. But
there is some potential here to forge a new alignment of Arab
countries."
   One reason U.S. officials think such an alignment is
possible is that it happened before. That was more than three
decades ago under different circumstances. It was the
mid-1950s. Just as today, tensions were running high over
foreign intervention in the region and Iraqi policies were at
the heart of the trouble.
   The big difference is that in those days Iraq was
cooperating with the West. It led the Baghdad Pact, an
alliance of nations siding with Britain in a security
alliance. That incensed Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, which
united in a loose coalition opposed to Iraq's policy of
inviting foreign powers into the region's affairs.
   Now, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia are working with the
West to contain Iraq. But the nations are so different that
this may be an alliance built on shifting sands.
   Egypt is a secular republic that in the past three decades
has formed strong alliances with superpowers, first with the
Soviet Union and then the U.S. It has decided that the only
option for Arabs is peace with Israel. Its president, Hosni
Mubarak, is the Arab leader most closely identified with the
U.S. and the peace effort.
   Syria also is a secular state, ruled by the Baath Party of
President Hafez Assad. The Baathists are ardent supporters of
the concept of a united and independent Arab nation, so they
dislike the close alliances with outside powers Egypt has
pursued. Syria has for 20 years been the primary spoiler of
the Arab-Israeli peace process Egypt espouses.
   Saudi Arabia is a deeply conservative Islamic monarchy run
by King Fahd, who has never been particularly close to either
Mr. Mubarak or Mr. Assad. The Saudis shunned Egypt after its
Camp David peace treaties with Israel, and they have
struggled unsuccessfully for years to persuade Mr. Assad to
end his occupation of Lebanon. The Saudis share Egypt's
affinity for the U.S., but they have a long history of
suspicion of the Soviets, who have armed Syria.
   The end of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry, combined with the
emergence of a threat from Iraq, could mean previous
differences can be swept aside. The Mideast always has been a
land of strange bedfellows.
   Even the three nations' reasons for opposing Iraq are
slightly different. Saudi Arabia sees a threat to its kingdom
and its oil fields from Iraqi troops in Kuwait. Egypt sees
Iraq as its historic rival for leadership of the Arab world
and fears Saddam Hussein's long-term goal is to sweep away
such moderate Arabs as Mr. Mubarak. And Syria simply hates
Iraq because of a long-term feud between their rival Baath
parties.
   If Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia can team up in a working
coalition that works in step with the U.S., the development
would have widespread implications. But it remains unclear
whether that three-way coalition can be firm enough to serve
as the core of what Secretary of State James Baker last week
called a "more durable order" in the Middle East.
