   LONDON (AP) -- Two top British mineworkers' leaders will
be charged with improper accounting after an inquiry into
union finances during the 1984-85 miners' strike, a court
official said.
   John Richman, a Sheffield Magistrates' Court clerk, said
he issued nine summonses against Arthur Scargill, president
of the National Union of Mineworkers, and union general
secretary Peter Heathfield, as well as against the union
itself.

   The charges are failure to keep proper accounting records,
failure to maintain a satisfactory system of accounting
control and failure to submit true and fair accounts. The two
men face fines if convicted.
   "We have done nothing wrong, and we shall contest the
action all the way," Mr. Scargill said. "This is the latest
in a long line of attacks on the national leadership of the
miners' union from the establishment who have never forgiven
us for what we did in the 1984-85 miners' strike."
   Mr. Scargill led the bitter and futile showdown with the
government over the closure of unproductive mines. The union,
which had 235,000 members at the time, now has 50,000, and 98
mines have been closed.
   In July the union sued Mr. Scargill to recover #1.4
million ($2.6 million) that had been donated by Soviet and
Eastern European miners to help the British miners during the
strike.
   The court granted the union a delay while it sought to
settle the issue by negotiation. Today, a union delegation is
to go to the Paris headquarters of the International Miners'
Organization to determine control of the funds.
