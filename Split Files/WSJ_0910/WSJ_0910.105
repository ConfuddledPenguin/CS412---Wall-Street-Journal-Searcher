   Hoare Govett Securities Ltd. of London is likely to
announce early this week a buy-out from Security Pacific
Corp., a person familiar with the Los Angeles-based banking
concern's unit said.
   Under the proposed buy-out plan, Hoare Govett managers
would buy 51% of the brokerage house, with Security Pacific
retaining 49%, the person said, declining to speculate on the
price.

   Security Pacific paid a total of about #50 million ($95.6
million) for Hoare Govett. It initially bought slightly less
than 30% of Hoare Govett in 1982. It boosted its stake to
about 80% in early 1986 -- taking control as banks were
snapping up British brokerage concerns ahead of the
deregulation of London's financial markets -- and to 100% in
1987. But international securities trading in London has been
depressed since the October 1987 stock market crash, leading
to a shake-out of brokerage firms. Security Pacific said in
May 1989 it might sell or reduce its investment in Hoare
Govett.
