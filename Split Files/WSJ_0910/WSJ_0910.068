<TEXT>
   With long years of work at meager pay,
   My value to the firm is deceptive;
   For though not innovative or brilliant,
   I've certainly been cost-effective.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   Materialistic
                                                                                                       

   With all due respect to best sellers,
   Which I acknowledge in haste,
   All I acquired in kindergarten
   Was a taste for library paste.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
