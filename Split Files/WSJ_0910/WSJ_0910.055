   MARXWALDE, East Germany -- "It is all over," Lt. Col.
Frank Fuessl says softly as he surveys the familiar MiG-21
cockpit. The Soviet-built fighter, parked in a camouflaged
maintenance bay, is one of 40 modernized MiG-21s attached to
the Hermann Matern Fighter Squadron.
   The veteran pilot, who can rattle off 100 flight commands
in Russian, recalls the countless Warsaw Pact briefings, the
coastal patrols, the dogfights with mock North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces. Col. Fuessl leans inside the
fighter, flicks on the gun sights and manipulates the
throttle. He never wanted a war, he says, but he would have
done his duty.

   "She really is a peppy plane," he says, adding with a
vague nod westward, "She could have held her own against
anything over there."
   Now, he will never know. When Germany is officially
unified Oct. 3, his squadron will be wiped out without a
single shot being fired. The German unification treaty calls
for the absorption of East Germany's armed forces by its
former enemy, the West German Bundeswehr, America's biggest
NATO ally.
   The annexation poses logistical problems that will send
Bonn's already stratospheric unification bill soaring even
higher. "Very roughly," says Bernd Wilz, defense-policy
speaker for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, "it could come to 10 billion marks ($6.43
billion) in 1991" alone.
   Merger also carries a high human cost, and will turn the
world of men like Col. Fuessl upside down. "Now, I'm a
42-year-old fighter pilot with a family," he says, "and my
prospects are absolutely zero."
   Overnight, West German officers will assume control of
East German units and begin to sort through East German arms
and personnel to determine what can be saved. Most of East
Germany's 445 combat aircraft -- useless for a West German
Luftwaffe that is part of NATO -- will be either scrapped or
sold. East Germany also has 2,220 tanks, 2,200
heavy-artillery pieces and several thousand trucks, the West
Germans estimate.
   For four decades, East Germany's National People's Army
was one of Moscow's staunchest Warsaw Pact allies, with a
prominent role to play in any European war. The officers were
all Communist Party members, sworn to defend East Germany and
communism in close alliance with the Soviet Union.
   Last year, East Germany's army had 178,000 men under arms;
today, a few more than 90,000 remain. Rainer Eppelmann, the
pacifist pastor serving as East Germany's post-revolution
defense minister, cut back on conscripts and thinned out the
officer corps. Many officers resigned, and many enlisted men
were discharged to join East Germany's growing unemployment
lines.
   Of the East German troops that remain, only 50,000 are
expected to stay on active duty in the united force once a
two-year screening and integration process is completed. The
5,000 commissars who led political classes and kept their
ears open for incautious criticism of socialist achievements
have already been dropped. Nobody over the age of 50 will be
accepted, which excludes most of East Germany's 35 remaining
generals and admirals; of the handful that might make the
cut, none are expected to be given command of a major
military unit.
   Those kept on will receive Bundeswehr uniforms and
insignia on Oct. 3, when West German Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg will issue his first orders to former East German
troops. Mr. Stoltenberg has appointed West German Lt. Gen.
Joerg Schoenbohm to head a staff of 80 West German officers
forming the nucleus of Bonn's new district military
headquarters in East Germany. The staff will oversee about
1,000 West German officers from all three services, who will
"advise" or assume command of former East German units.
   Any East German officers retained will probably have to
accept a reduction in rank, and for some time continue to
live with East German pay -- about one-third of comparable
West German levels. But the pay of East German conscripts
will be raised to West German levels.
   "Psychologically, it's an unusual and very complicated
situation," says Col. Uwe Hempel, a spokesman for the East
German Defense Ministry, which will cease to act
independently next month.
   Bonn officials coordinating the takeover acknowledge that
the adjustment will be difficult, particularly for career
officers. "Our intention is to be as humane, socially
equitable and psychologically sensitive as possible," says
the CDU's Mr. Wilz. After listening to the concerns of East
German soldiers on such matters as pay and job security, he
adds, "we can't let our people simply go in and start giving
orders without considering the people there."
   There has been some friction already. East German officers
were enraged by a report in Der Spiegel magazine that they
would initially be issued only fatigues because West German
officers refused to allow them to wear the Bundeswehr dress
uniform. Bonn insists that stocks of dress uniforms were too
low for immediate distribution, but the East Germans simmer
with wounded pride.
   As the two armies get a closer look at each other, some
East German personnel also have bristled at the impression of
being treated like a defeated army. "We know that many
Bundeswehr officers categorically refuse to work with former
East German officers," says Lt. Col. Hermann Schade,
executive officer of the Hermann Matern squadron. "There's no
reason why I can't continue to do staff work in the
Bundeswehr. But I've done this job for 18 years, and now it's
wasted. All we expect is to go out with our dignity."
   The two German armies even have some trouble communicating
in their own language. "For me, it's natural to speak Russian
with someone on the telephone," says Col. Hempel. "But when
we talk with Bundeswehr officers in German, we noticed how
many English terms they used. Sometimes, we just couldn't
follow."
   The fighter squadron at the sprawling Marxwalde base has
little chance of survival. And prospects that the
installation itself would be retained as a NATO air base are
dim. The bunkers and maintenance bays are too small for NATO
fighters, which are also probably too heavy for the taxiways.
   The Hermann Matern squadron has already lost 400 enlisted
men from its former ground staff of 900. Most ties with the
Soviet command were severed months ago, and the Soviets have
removed secret communications gear from East German bases.
   Meanwhile, the airmen at Marxwalde are hedging their bets
about staying in NATO uniforms. Some of the younger pilots
may get the chance to become part of the Bundeswehr's
Luftwaffe and be retrained on NATO fighters, such as the F-4
Phantom or the Tornado.
   But many of the pilots, fearing discharge, have already
applied to Lufthansa or other airlines for civilian jobs.
Many mechanics have applied for jobs at West German aerospace
firms. Some even want to try their luck in the U.S.
