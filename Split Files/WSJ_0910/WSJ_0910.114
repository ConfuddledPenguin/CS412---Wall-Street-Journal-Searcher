   Montedison S.p.A. accepted a proposal by the Italian
government to settle conflicts about control of their joint
chemical venture, Enimont S.p.A., but it also set out a
procedure for unwinding the public-private partnership,
should the founding shareholders be unable to agree.
   Montedison said that if both parties agree, it will accept
a management arrangement for the company to oversee Enimont's
daily operations and for the state energy agency Ente
Nazionale Idrocarburi, or ENI, to direct "control and
finances." But the government cleared the way for the state
to sell its stake in the chemical venture to Montedison, or
vice versa, should cooperation fail.

   Enimont was founded last year by Montedison and ENI, which
each hold 40%, to consolidate Italy's chemical interests into
a player capable of competing on the world market, but
Enimont has been shaken by relentless arguing between the two
partners and a downturn in the world chemical industry.
Montedison said it would consider an ENI offer to buy its 40%
holding.
