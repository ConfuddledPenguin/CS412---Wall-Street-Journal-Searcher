   BIG MAC IN CHINA

   Thousands of Chinese flocked to a McDonald's office in
southern China where the fast-food giant is hiring employees
for its first restaurant in the communist nation.
   McDonald's plans to open a 500-seat restaurant in
Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, on Oct. 8. Two Shenzhen newspaper
ads recently drew more than 6,000 applicants for 240
part-time jobs, an official at the Shenzhen McDonald's said.
Some applicants held university degrees, he said.
   The newspaper ads, displaying the traditional McDonald's
striped shirts with matching caps, read: "More than 200
youths in Shenzhen are going to put on this uniform, a symbol
of a prosperous future. As an aggressive person, what are you
waiting for?"
                                                                                                       

   THATCHER'S FIVE-YEAR PLAN?
                                                                                                       

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher hinted she might
try to stay in office another five years.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who will be 65 next month, said she
wouldn't rule out being prime minister at age 70. "I've got a
lot left in me yet," she told a television interviewer.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who took office in May 1979, is Britain's
longest-serving prime minister since 1827. She already has
pledged to lead her Conservative Party into the next general
election, which must be held by June 1992. But many
commentators previously had suggested that she would retire
shortly afterwards.
                                                                                                       

   LI PENG DAMPS REFORM
                                                                                                       

   Chinese Premier Li Peng resigned as head of a commission
that pioneered market-oriented economic reforms, a move that
analysts say signals an effort to further weaken the
commission.
   The new head of the State Commission for the Restructuring
of the Economy, a cabinet-level agency, will be Chen Jinhua,
who had been president of China Petrochemical Corp. Diplomats
and Western businessmen said the appointment of an official
with little political clout dealt a further blow to the
commission.
   "Mr. Chen's appointment is another indication that
economic reform is on the back burner," one Chinese Communist
Party member said.
                                                                                                       

   LAND PLAN FOR ROMANIA
                                                                                                       

   Romania plans to restore limited private ownership of farm
land collectivized under 40 years of communist rule, a senior
Agriculture Ministry official said. But the official, George
Mischie, said state farms had been excluded from the
proposals, which also foresaw an initial limit of 247 acres
on individual land ownership and a five-year ban on its
resale. State farms account for about one-fifth of cultivated
land, with the rest held by cooperative farms or as
individual plots.
                                                                                                       

   NISSAN'S TRAVELING TEAM
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nissan Motor Co. said it is sending a research
team to Europe and the U.S. to visit leading semiconductor
manufacturers, aiming to expand overseas procurement of
semiconductors. Representatives from Nissan's purchasing
department, electronics-parts and design engineers from
Nissan and affiliated electronics-parts manufacturers and
engineers from Nissan European Technology Center will be
among those on the team.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIETS SEARCH FOR STOLEN ART
                                                                                                       

   Dutch art experts hope that hundreds of Old Master
drawings will soon be returned to a Rotterdam museum, half a
century after they were taken away by Nazis. Altogether, 490
works are missing, and the Dutch are convinced they were
looted by Soviet troops in Germany in 1945. Albert Elen of
the Office for Fine Arts, who is heading the search, said
Moscow is now hunting for the drawings. "The Russian
authorities have said they will do their utmost to try to
locate the drawings," he said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW VACCINE EFFORT
                                                                                                       

   The World Health Organization, the United Nations
Development Program and Unicef launched a $150 million
international effort to come up with new and improved
vaccines for children throughout the developing world.
   WHO estimates that the vaccines will prevent diseases that
now kill some eight million children a year and cause 900
million episodes of severe illness among children in the
developing world. It said improvement of existing vaccines is
its first priority. "By the end of this decade, we want
vaccines which require fewer doses, which can better
withstand exposure to heat and which can give better
protection," said Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of WHO.
   The campaign's ultimate aim is a single-dose "children's
vaccine" that would deliver many immunizing antigens at the
same time. This "ideal vaccine," WHO said, is a distant, but
achievable, goal.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to accept the controversial
Our Lady of Peace basilica in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, as
Vatican property today. The project, much criticized as
excessively grand, cost an estimated $150 million, which
Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny says came from
his own pockets. . . . Amnesty International accused the West
African state of Mali of human-rights abuses against ethnic
Tuaregs, including the detention without trial of leading
tribesmen. Amnesty said it feared Tuaregs were being detained
for purely ethnic reasons, following attacks by tribe members
this year in which government officials and civilians were
killed.
