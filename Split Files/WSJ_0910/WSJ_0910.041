   NEW YORK -- A lawyer for Nynex Corp. disclosed that the
fired Nynex purchasing executive who ran so-called pervert
conventions told company investigators in 1986 that "one or
two phone company employees" and a supplier had attended his
annual fishing parties in Minnesota.
   The disclosure, which raises further questions about
conflicts of interest involving the company and certain
suppliers, was made in a long list of technical corrections
to testimony in a New York rate case. The phone company
didn't have any comment.

   Nynex's New York Telephone unit has been seeking a rate
increase of about $825 million to start Jan. 1, and a major
topic in that case has been activities of the company's
purchasing arm, Materiel Enterprises Co.
   State regulators and others have been examining phone
company overcharges on purchases from Materiel Enterprises.
Another focus has been whether suppliers who attended annual
gatherings in Florida, nicknamed pervert conventions,
received special treatment in the contracting process. The
parties included employees of about 30 Nynex suppliers, nine
Nynex employees, and prostitutes. Nynex has denied any
connection between sales to the company and vendors'
attendance at the Florida parties.
   Lawrence Friedman, the purchasing executive who organized
the pervert conventions and the Minnesota fishing trips, was
fired after a Nynex investigation in 1988. The company also
dismissed another manager and disciplined seven more.
