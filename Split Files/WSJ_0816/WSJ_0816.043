   FORT LEE, N.J. -- On-Line Software International Inc.'s
board approved a measure designed to make hostile takeovers
prohibitively expensive.
   The computer software and services company will distribute
rights to buy preferred stock to holders of common shares on
Sept. 6. Under certain circumstances, the rights allow the
holders to buy shares of On-Line or its buyer at half price.

   A spokeswoman said the board, which announced the action
Tuesday, knows of no attempts to take control of On-Line
Software.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
On-Line shares closed at $7 a share, up 25 cents.
