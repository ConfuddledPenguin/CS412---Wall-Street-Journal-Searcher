   NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market edged higher in a
sleepy session, but still outpaced the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index added 1.12 points, or 0.27%, to
411.45 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained
0.24%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, added
only 0.02% as some oil stocks weakened.

   The Nasdaq Utility Index, which surged more than 2%
Tuesday on a rebound in cellular telephone stocks, was the
weakest of the Nasdaq sub-indexes yesterday, with a
1.34-point loss to 567.57.
   OTC advancers held a slim lead over decliners, with 980
stocks rising in price, while 863 fell. National Market
System volume slipped to 77,199,000 shares from Tuesday's
already light 80,929,000.
   Meanwhile, large OTC financial stocks, which have long
underperformed the rest of the market, were stronger
yesterday. The Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, which tracks the
top unlisted financial stocks, rose 1.80 to 347.41. The
Nasdaq 100 Index, which follows the largest non-financial OTC
stocks, added only 0.34 to 416.93.
   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional sales trading at
Lehman Brothers, said the OTC market is still catching up
with listed stocks after falling further in the recent
sell-off.
   Mr. O'Toole said retail investors remain sidelined.
"Institutional investors were the only real buyers today," he
asserted.
   Associated Communications added 1 1/4 to 21 1/2 after
reporting that its loss for the second quarter narrowed to
two cents a share from a loss of nine cents a year earlier.
   American Integrity surged 1 1/8 to 6. The company, which
reported a second-quarter loss of 10 cents a share, said it
is engaged in talks that may lead to its acquisition. No
agreement has yet been reached, the company said.
   Allied Clinical Laboratories gave back 1/2 to 11 1/2 after
gaining 1 1/4 Tuesday. The company reported second-quarter
profit of 16 cents a share, compared with pro-forma profit of
a penny a share for the quarter last year.
   Survival Technologies dropped 1/4 to 13 1/4 after falling
1 point Tuesday when the company said that it expects to
report a "small loss" for the year ended in July. Survival
had a loss of 51 cents a share a year ago. Survival's stock
rocketed earlier this week on hopes that Defense Department
contracts for its auto-injectors would boost sales. The
injectors are used to administer antidotes against chemical
weapons.
   Crest Industries recovered 1/8 to 4 1/2 after losing 1 5/8
Tuesday. The company said the stock's drop Tuesday was due to
a misunderstanding of its fiscal first-quarter earnings
report. Crest earned $850,247, or 42 cents a share, in its
latest quarter ended in June, compared with year-ago pro
forma first-quarter net of $832,452. Crest's profit for the
latest quarter had been compared to its earnings of about
$1.3 million in the quarter last year when Crest was a
subchapter S corporation. Only the pro forma year-ago figures
are comparable, however, because of the different tax status
of a subchapter S corporation. Crest went public in July.
   Leading the most active list, Sun Microsystems slid 3/4 to
28 1/4. The company signed a patent and cross-licensing
agreement with International Business Machines under which
each company granted the other a world-wide, non-exclusive
license covering patents having an effective filing date
before July 1, 1995.
