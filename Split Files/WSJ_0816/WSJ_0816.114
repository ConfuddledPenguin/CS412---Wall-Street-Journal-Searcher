   A settlement for the sale of Alan Bond's Australian
breweries appeared to head off threats by disgruntled U.S.
investors to liquidate the operations. The accord means Mr.
Bond's brewing stake will be diluted by a big new
shareholder-New Zealand brewer Lion Nathan Ltd.
   For months, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. has been trying to
sell the breweries to its 58%-owned Bell Resources Ltd. unit.

   Shareholders of Bell Resources approved that company's
proposal to purchase Bond Corp.'s Australian breweries for a
previously agreed price of A$1.85 billion. Bell Resources has
a longstanding loan to cash-strapped Bond Corp. of A$1.2
billion; it has been turned into a deposit on the breweries.
The sale is part of a corporate overhaul intended to reduce
debt that totals about five billion Australian dollars
(US$4.03 billion).
   Just ahead of the shareholders meeting, Bell Resources
announced a proposal to sell half the breweries to Lion
Nathan, partly in return for a commitment from Lion Nathan to
provide A$300 million to help fund the repurchase of US$510
million in debentures issued to American investors by Bond
Brewing Holdings Ltd., the Bond group's main Australian beer
unit.
