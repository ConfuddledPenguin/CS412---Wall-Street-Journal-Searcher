   Futures prices for crude oil and gold have skyrocketed in
response to tensions in the Middle East, but there's little
evidence that inflationary fears are spreading to other
commodity markets.
   Abundant supplies of U.S. grain crops and declining export
demand are likely to keep most agricultural commodity price
gains modest. A slowdown in world economic growth and in
metal consumption also will hold back price gains for metals
futures and related industrial products.

   An index of prices for 23 commodities that excludes oil
and gold has declined 2% in value since July 1, despite
events in the Mideast, according to Commodity Research Bureau
Inc. "The commodity markets are trying to tell us that this
is a temporary oil shock that will not cause overall higher
inflation," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co.
   Even if oil prices remain near current levels a year from
now, other commodity markets aren't expected to feel much
inflationary heat. By that time, oil prices would have pushed
the economies of many countries into recession, which would
curtail demand for most commodities.
   The following is a survey of price trends in a half-dozen
commodity futures markets:
                                                                                                       

   Wheat
                                                                                                       

   Favorable weather patterns and "abysmal" export demand
have depressed U.S. wheat futures prices about 30% in the
past year, says Daniel Basse, director of market research for
AgResource Co., Chicago. Just last week, the Agriculture
Department said it expects the harvest for the crop year
ended June 30 to total 2.71 billion bushels. That would be a
33% jump from the year-earlier drought-shriveled harvest. By
next June, U.S. wheat stockpiles are expected to reach 846
million bushels, up from a drought-reduced 542 million for
the year just ended.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is predicting a near-record
grain crop this season. Even if millions of bushels rot in
the fields because of bureaucratic bungling and scarce fuel
for harvest machinery, the crop is expected to reduce Soviet
grain imports from all sources by 20% through mid-1991. A
scarcity of hard-currency reserves is also curtailing
Moscow's imports. Other importers, eyeing mounting wheat
stockpiles world-wide, aren't rushing to place orders with
U.S. suppliers, either.
                                                                                                       

   Corn
                                                                                                       

   The same trends pushing wheat futures lower are weighing
on corn futures prices. A wet spring delayed planting in many
regions, but favorable conditions since then are expected to
result in a 4% increase in this year's crop to 7.85 billion
bushels. Year-end stockpiles are expected to grow as well, to
1.33 billion bushels from 1.22 billion a year earlier. Soviet
corn imports are likely to tail off in line with wheat
imports.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   Unlike wheat and corn stockpiles, sugar supplies are
relatively tight after two years of strong demand. But
because Iraq is a major sugar importer, sugar futures prices
plunged on news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Prices bounced
back somewhat in subsequent days as traders decided the
sell-off had gone too far.
   Rumors of recent export demand are also supporting prices,
although U.S. buyers appeared to back away as prices
approached 11 cents a pound in recent days, says Charles
Kolligian, a futures trader with Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. in New
York. Sugar futures prices may climb further in coming months
if, in the face of sustained higher oil prices, Brazil
diverts more of its sugar crop to produce gasohol, which
would further shrink world sugar supplies.
                                                                                                       

   Copper
                                                                                                       

   Relatively brisk demand from Europe and Japan, coupled
with supplies that have been reduced by labor disputes or
other disruptions at mines in Chile, Peru, Zambia and New
Guinea, have pushed futures prices higher. Japanese imports
of refined copper this year are expected to be 35% higher
than last year. Users' inventories are at about four weeks'
consumption, compared with a longer-term average of five to
six weeks, says Frederick Demler, a futures analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Nevertheless, world copper consumption is expected to rise
just 1% this year as economic growth in most Western
countries continues to slow. And if oil prices remain at
current levels a year from now, copper consumption in 1991
could be flat with this year or down by about 1%, Mr. Demler
says.

   Aluminum
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices are higher, mainly because of concern about
possible production disruptions at four aluminum smelters in
the Mideast, two in the United Arab Emirates and one each in
Iran and Bahrain. The four smelters collectively account for
about 3% of world aluminum production, Mr. Demler says.
   But demand for aluminum is declining in step with slowing
economic growth around the world. Consumption is expected to
be up about 1% this year from last, but that pales beside the
5% gain seen in 1989. Sustained higher oil prices would be
likely to reduce demand from several industries that are
major consumers, including the automobile, construction and
aircraft industries. Beverage container makers are also big
users of aluminum, but higher oil prices won't put much of a
dent in their consumption, Mr. Demler says.
                                                                                                       

   Silver
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices have ridden gold's coattails to higher
levels in recent weeks, but the rise is almost exclusively
due to uncertainty about the Mideast. World consumption of
silver is expected to increase this year only 1%, compared
with 4.5% in 1989, Mr. Demler says.
   In any case, the rally in silver futures prices started
from such depressed levels that it isn't likely to provide an
inflationary "kick" to the economy. A few months ago, silver
futures traded at less than $5 an ounce, or close to the cost
of production for several major producers.
   In commodity market activity yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices ended slightly higher in another
volatile session dominated by news and speculation from the
Middle East. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for
September delivery ended at $26.46 a barrel, up four cents.
The contract traded as high as $26.75 and as low as $25.60.
Late in the afternoon, prices fell after the Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report said Saudi Arabia was working
on a formula to allow 11 OPEC members to produce the group's
self-imposed quota of 22.5 million barrels a day. Such a plan
would restore almost all of what the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries was producing before Iraq
invaded Kuwait, resulting in a world-wide embargo against oil
from those two countries.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Late profit-taking in gold erased early
gains triggered by a tough speech on the Middle East by
President Bush. Gold for December deliver ended with a loss
of $2.70 an ounce at $411.30 after trading as high as
$414.40. Mr. Bush said the U.S. must make sure that the trade
and oil embargo imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait
remains tight. Analysts said gold producers have been
aggressive sellers in recent days. One analyst said the
producers "may have sold more recently than they've sold in
12 months." But the market was volatile, with traders warily
watching the arrival of Jordan's King Hussein in the U.S. for
a meeting with Mr. Bush. "Many traders sold contracts because
they don't want to be caught by any surprises that may
develop from the meeting," one analyst said. In the cash
market, the bullion price dipped as far as $398 an ounce but
was able to recover to above $400 and stay there. Silver,
meanwhile, suffered a sharp break after two days of strong
advances, reacting to similar moves in gold. "Anytime gold
shows signs of easing, there is a tendency among traders to
quickly liquidate their long {buying} positions in silver
because the supply of the metal is adequate," one analyst
said. Silver is "a purely speculative market that's not
trading on supply-demand fundamentals," he said. The December
contract settled 13.1 cents lower at $5.2010 an ounce.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices fluctuated in
a 12-cent range before closing slightly higher. Prices
plunged in early trading on reports, which turned out to be
erroneous, that Brazil was providing much more credit than
expected to farmers. That led futures traders to predict that
Brazil would produce more soybeans for export, thereby
boosting world supplies and lowering cash and futures market
prices. Later, analysts learned that the credit was for $4.2
billion, which was in line with expectations. Futures prices
were also whipsawed by reports, later apparently contradicted
by the Agriculture Department, that export credits for the
purchase of vegetable oils would be reduced. Soybeans for
November delivery gained 1.25 cents a bushel to close at
$6.27.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were mixed. The October contract
plunged its limit of two cents a pound for the second day in
a row, ending at 70.85 cents, but later months showed slight
gains. The selling in the October contract kept pressure on
other months and limited their gains, said Thomas Mueller, a
Merrill Lynch analyst. Mr. Mueller said that until recently
there was strong buying of the October contract, as traders
believed that commitments to industrial users wouldn't be met
because of weather problems in the Rio Grande Valley
cotton-growing areas in Texas. But lately, the crop in the
Mississippi Delta has made excellent progress and seems
likely to make up for any shortages from Texas, according to
Mr. Mueller. He also said fears of a recession, which could
sharply reduce industrial demand for cotton, have prompted
traders to sell contracts.
