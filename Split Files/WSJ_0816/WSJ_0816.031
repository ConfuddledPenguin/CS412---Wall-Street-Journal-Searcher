   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. holders have tendered
some 95.5% of the cable-TV equipment company under a
$44.50-a-share offer from leveraged buy-out specialist
Forstmann Little &amp; Co.
   The offer, announced last month and set to expire last
Monday, was extended through 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday because of a
power outage in New York's financial district that prevented
some holders from tendering.
