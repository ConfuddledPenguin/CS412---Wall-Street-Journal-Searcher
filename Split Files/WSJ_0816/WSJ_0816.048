   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its long-term debt ratings of First City Bancorp
of Texas, citing the bank holding company's exposure to the
weak Texas real-estate market.
   The investment rating service also downgraded its rating
for long-term deposits at the company's lead bank, First
City, Texas-Houston N.A., for the same reason.

   First City said management "strongly disagrees" with the
move and "has a far more positive view of the improving Texas
economy and its impact on First City's real-estate
portfolio."
   Moody's, while acknowledging "some improvement" in Texas
real estate, said the large real-estate portfolio in
Collecting Bank, a separate entity set up by First City
Bancorp to liquidate problem loans, as well as the
real-estate holdings of the lead bank, "could require
substantial further provisioning and may make it difficult to
establish an ongoing earnings stream."
   The changes, affecting about $353 million of debt, lowered
the holding company's senior obligations to Ba-2 from Ba-1;
subordinated obligations to Ba-3 from Ba-2; and senior
preferred stock to Ba-3 from Ba-2. Moody's confirmed the
company's commercial paper rating at Not Prime.
   Meanwhile, the rating of the lead bank's long-term
deposits fell to Baa-3 from Baa-2, while the rating for
short-term deposits was confirmed at Prime-3, Moody's said.
