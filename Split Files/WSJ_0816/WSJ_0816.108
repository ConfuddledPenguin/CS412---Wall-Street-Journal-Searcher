   AMC Entertainment Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said an
agreement under which TPI Enterprises Inc. was to purchase 34
AMC theaters was amended, largely cancelling the planned
purchases.
   TPI, under a 1988 pact, has already purchased the
interests in 56 theaters from AMC for about $128 million.
That agreement called for TPI to acquire another 34 AMC movie
houses, but those provisions have been terminated. Closure of
the now-cancelled sale was originally set for February, but
it had been pushed back a number of times.

   AMC, which holds an about 28% stake in TPI Enterprises,
said TPI told the company it had decided to focus on its
existing theater markets.
   Had the deal been consummated as originally envisioned,
said an AMC official, the full 90-theater sale would have
been "on the order of $200 million." Under the new terms, TPI
retains the option to purchase five of the theaters.
