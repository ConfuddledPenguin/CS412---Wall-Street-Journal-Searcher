   TORONTO -- Robert Hall was named to succeed Robert Jachino
as chief executive officer of Thomson Corp.'s specialized
publishing group, which last year accounted for 39% of
Thomson's $5.11 billion sales and 50.5% of its operating
profit.
   Mr. Jachino, 56 years old, who also is an executive vice
president of Thomson, said in a statement that he planned to
give up his executive positions next Jan. 1, to spend more
time with his family. He will continue as non-executive
chairman of the group, which produces a wide range of
specialized publications in printed and electronic forms.
