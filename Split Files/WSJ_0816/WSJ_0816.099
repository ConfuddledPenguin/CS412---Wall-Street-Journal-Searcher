   First Connecticut Small Business Investment Co., a
federally licensed SBIC based in Bridgeport, said it filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
   The filing is the latest in a string of SBICs, operating
under one of the Small Business Administration's largest loan
programs, that have encountered financial troubles. Already,
170 of these private venture-capital concerns have gone into
liquidation proceedings, leaving the SBA's lending exposure
at about $500 million. The agency said 388 SBICs are still in
operation.

   The SBA has recovered roughly $66 million, and expects to
recoup an additional $220 million by selling the dissolved
assets.
   SBICs are licensed by the SBA to provide
government-guaranteed loans and equity financing for small
businesses. Since 1958, the concerns have invested about $9
billion in private and government funds in new companies.
   But in the past two years, the number of SBIC failures has
doubled, said Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), chairman of the
Small Business Committee. He said 30 to 40 failures are
predicted for this year.
   River Capital Corp., an SBIC in Springfield, Va., recently
defaulted on $28.5 million in SBA loans.
   In its petition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Connecticut in Bridgeport, First Connecticut
listed assets of approximately $70 million and liabilities of
approximately $60 million. Chapter 11 shields a company from
creditors' lawsuits while it forms a plan to pay its debts.
   Echoing other SBICs in their moves for bankruptcy-law
protection, First Connecticut said its filing was made
necessary by liquidity problems caused by a sharp downturn in
the business climate in its market area. These problems were
accelerated, the company said, when the SBA asked for payment
by Aug. 24 of three subordinated debenture issues totaling
$5.5 million that were due June 30, and when requests were
made for payment by many loan participants who have the right
to put their loan participations to First Connecticut on
short notice. The company has about $30 million of such
participations.
   SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter declared a 90-day
moratorium on SBIC licensing that took effect June 29. During
the moratorium, the agency is making administrative and
regulatory changes in the program, concentrating on
tightening control of the active SBICs and speeding the
shutdown of those being liquidated.
   Meanwhile, nearly 40 SBIC license applications are pending
at the SBA, representing private capital of more than $80
million.
   "I don't think there will ever be a time when there will
not be an SBIC failure," an SBA spokesman said. "It's a risky
business. They're not buying stock in IBM."
