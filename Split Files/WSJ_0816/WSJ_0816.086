   DETROIT -- Pentagon investigators said they are launching
an inquiry into whether Ford Motor Co. should receive $100
million from the pension fund of the aerospace and defense
unit it recently agreed to sell to Loral Corp.
   As part of its plans to buy Ford Aerospace Corp. for $715
million and the assumption of certain obligations, Loral
agreed to let Ford keep about $100 million from Ford
Aerospace's overfunded pension fund, said persons familiar
with the transaction. The fund currently has about $300
million more than it apparently needs to meet its
obligations, these persons say.

   But Defense Department officials said they may have a
claim to some assets in the Ford Aerospace pension funds,
because the money put into the funds was paid to Ford in
compensation for defense contracts. Thus, the officials said,
the $100 million in excess assets might have to be returned
to the government, and might not legitimately belong to the
auto maker.
   "The Department of Defense has placed a good chunk of
those funds in there," said Derek Vander Schaff, deputy
inspector general for the Defense Department. "The question
is are these companies allowed to do this with money the
government hasn't taken back out."
   Mr. Vander Schaff said the inquiry began last week and is
now in "very preliminary stages" with government auditors
reviewing the transaction.
   Ford officials confirmed the auto maker is getting some
money out of the overfunded pension as part of the pending
transaction with Loral. "We aren't transferring all of the
{pension} surplus to Loral," said Ford spokesman Thomas
Rhoades. "But we are transferring more than enough to cover
all of Ford Aerospace's employees." Ford officials declined
to specify how much the company is getting from the pension
fund, which has a total of about $1 billion in assets.
   In an interview, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz said the
New York-based defense electronics concern hasn't been
contacted by the Pentagon about the pension fund, but he said
he isn't concerned that it's being scrutinized. "That's their
job," he said. Mr. Schwartz also declined to specify how much
Ford would extract before transferring assets to Loral.
   The important thing, he stressed, is that Loral is set to
receive enough to meet all pension-fund obligations for
current Ford Aerospace employees as well as retirees, plus
another 50% or so. "From Loral's point of view, there is no
issue here," the chairman said. "The employees are fully
covered. Besides the pension fund, the surplus and Loral's
own balance sheet, there are also government guarantees." He
likened the situation to having both "a belt and suspenders
on."
   Despite all the assurances that Ford Aerospace employee
benefits will be left intact, the ruckus over the pension
fund has made some workers nervous. "People are very
worried," said one top Ford Aerospace official. "There is a
general distrust here since we've been sold, and those
feelings are being aimed at Ford -- not Loral.
   "It's a complicated subject, and people aren't going to be
satisfied with a few words," he added. "They want details."
   Because Ford had anticipated potential Pentagon concerns
with the use of pension money, Loral agreed to indemnify the
car company against government action. "We assessed the risk
of that happening," Mr. Schwartz said. "Ford asked for
indemnification, and we determined it was not an excessive
risk." In other words, Loral essentially will assume any
possible liability stemming from a government attempt to get
the money back. Any such effort would likely take several
years to resolve, persons close to the deal said.
   The government's claim to the pension funds involves the
amount it allows defense companies, such as Ford Aerospace,
for overhead costs in bidding for contracts. But if the
pension costs paid by the Defense Department are lower than
expected, the government often seeks to have some of the
funds returned.
   "Pension funds are either underfunded or overfunded at any
point in time," Mr. Vander Schaff said. "There's never a time
when things match up exactly."
   Federal pension laws now forbid companies from taking
assets from existing pension funds. But companies have
circumvented that by terminating pension plans and
re-establishing them under a different name. With Ford
Aerospace, there are also questions about how much money the
government could lay claim to, given that the Newport Beach,
Calif., unit derives a good portion of its profits from the
commercial satellite market.
   Moreover, Mr. Schwartz said he understands that for years,
Ford hasn't added to the pension fund any money connected
with military contracts. "I just don't know on what basis the
government can make a claim," he said. "And until they do,
I'm not going to lose any sleep over it."
   The use of overfunded pensions to help finance corporate
acquisitions has become a source of concern in Congress,
which has held several hearings on ways to limit such
transfers.
