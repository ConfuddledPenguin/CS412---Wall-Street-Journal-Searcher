   Your July 30 editorial "Defense in Free Fall" should be
mandatory reading for every American voter. Without emotion
you have focused on the key issue: Will America allow itself
to be disarmed by Congress as it did after World War I, World
War II, Korea and Vietnam?
   As you pointed out, the country can afford to have a
national defense posture that will allow it to influence
world events in the future. The president's proposed budget
will bring military spending as a percentage of the GNP down
below what it was prior to World War II and will reach that
point through a logical, responsible drawdown. Within his
proposed budget is the B-2 Stealth bomber, which is
affordable and is a necessity for strategic deterrence.

   I find it appalling that the House Armed Services
Committee voted to kill the B-2. I have confidence that the
Senate and, it is hoped, the full House, will support the
B-2. The country should be concerned about the possible
irreparable damage to our nuclear deterrent force as well as
our total military posture.
