   The Macon, Ga.-based hospital chain also said it made a
scheduled $39 million interest payment on its 14.25% and 14%
subordinated debentures. "We're current with all our debt and
expect to remain so," said J. Rodney Laughlin, Charter's
executive vice president for human resources and development.
   He said the company has been working since June to improve
cash flow by cutting costs, mainly through reducing
personnel. In addition, he said, Charter will receive $42
million from the sale and leaseback of 12 hospitals to Health
Care Property Investors Inc. of Los Angeles.
