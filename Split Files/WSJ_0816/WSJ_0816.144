   New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, a Democrat,
on the proposed stock-transaction tax: "A bullet aimed at the
heart of New York City. This is a tax on all Americans who
save in the form of stocks and bonds, and in particular, it
is a tax on all American workers' pension funds. This is the
wrong tax at the wrong time." Next thing we know, Governor
Cuomo will be coming out for a cut in the capital-gains tax.
