   LONDON -- Taking advantage of the bull market in oil,
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC sold its 24.9% stake in
Enterprise Oil PLC to two British securities firms, Warburg
Securities Ltd. and Cazenove &amp; Co., for #679.6 million ($1.29
billion).
   The two companies immediately sold the 113.3 million
shares for a total of #687.7 million to about 80 institutions
in what apparently was the largest "bought deal," or crossed
trade, in U.K. history. Most of the institutions were
British, although there were some U.S. and Japanese buyers,
said Phillip Ellick, a director of Warburg, the lead broker
in the deal.

   The sale is a check to Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine,
the French state-controlled energy and chemical company,
which earlier this year had sought to buy ICI's Enterprise
stake. Elf currently owns 25.2% of the British North Sea oil
producer, whose earnings are expected to jump because of the
Persian Gulf oil crisis.
   ICI made an estimated #500 million on the sale, said Colin
Short, an executive director. ICI acquired the stake in 1987
by selling its oil and gas interests to Enterprise.
   The sale of the Enterprise stake had been expected for
some time. ICI, which has moved aggressively into specialty
chemicals to offset cycles in the bulk chemical business, has
been shedding peripheral lines.
   By fragmenting the Enterprise stake among dozens of
holders, ICI and its brokers apparently averted a political
problem that might have arisen if a majority interest in a
British oil company was acquired by a foreign
state-controlled entity.
   Enterprise contributed #37.1 million to ICI's #1.53
billion 1989 pretax profit. Given the sharp rise in oil
prices recently, it might have added #60 million this year
and up to #75 million in 1991, said Dion Steward, an analyst
at Paribas Capital Markets Group.
