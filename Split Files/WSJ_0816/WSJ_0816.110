   Before Donald Trump's Taj Mahal opened in April, the big
question in Atlantic City was whether the market could absorb
the megafacility while much of the Northeast was in a
recession.
   So far, the answer appears to be a resounding "no."

   Figures released by the New Jersey Casino Association show
the oceanside resort had its first losing second quarter
since gambling began there in 1978. Collectively, the 12
casinos had losses of $4.3 million before extraordinary items
last quarter, after earning about $24.7 million during the
same period in 1989. The figures include interest payments.
   Mr. Trump's fortunes were far worse than the rest of the
industry; his three casinos had losses of about $25 million
in the quarter, before extraordinary items are taken into
account. Mr. Trump's poor showing came despite the Taj's
record revenue of $104 million during that period. The Taj
posted a loss of $14.1 million during the quarter.
   "I guess the Taj did well enough to hurt everyone else but
not well enough to help Mr. Trump," said Richard Gillman,
chairman of Bally's Park Place, owned by Bally Manufacturing
Corp. "We had a good first quarter, but the opening of the
Taj was the straw that broke the camel's back."
   Mr. Trump's Taj and Trump Plaza were ranked first and
second in revenue, but figures released by the Casino
Association show that his costs and expenses also exceeded
those of the other casinos. Most of the Taj's expenses are
probably attributable to operational wrinkles that crop up
whenever a new casino opens. On the other hand, that facility
benefited from waves of pre-opening publicity, which isn't
expected to continue into the slow winter months.
   With a recovery in the Northeast not yet in sight, and no
casino close to shutting its doors, thus reducing
competition, operators aren't expecting things to get better
soon.
   "There really is a softening of demand for our product,"
said Ronald Lenczycki, president of Harrah's casino, which is
owned by Promus Cos. "It's impossible to know how long this
will last."
   Some properties did better than others, of course. Mr.
Lenczycki's Harrah's, for example, had the best quarter in
town, earning $15 million on a cash flow of $17.5 million.
Harrah's earnings were off about $5 million from the year
before, however. All these second-quarter results, and the
following, are calculated before extraordinary items.
   Bally's Park Place, which usually shares top billing with
Harrah's, had profit of $3.4 million on cash flow of $16.1
million, while Caesars, owned by Caesars World Inc., also
enjoyed a profitable quarter, earning $4 million on a cash
flow of $9.6 million.
   Mr. Trump's properties sagged under the weight of negative
publicity about his financial woes and ballooning debt
payments. Last year, Mr. Trump's properties eked out a $2.5
million profit in the second quarter, as opposed to this
quarter's $25 million loss.
   Mr. Trump's problems are magnified because he has debt
payments of $215 million in the next 12 months that could be
ruinous.
   But Mr. Trump's bad luck hasn't translated into good luck
for his competitors, and that's largely a result of poor
planning, say casino analysts. Because there is no major
airport nearby, 99% of all customers still arrive by car or
bus. And while a number of casinos have recently expanded
their parking capacity, competition for those customers is
still fierce and expensive.
   Patrons who take a bus from New York City to the Taj
Mahal, for example, pay a $20 round trip but receive $12.50
in quarters, a $5 voucher redeemable at a later date and a $5
voucher toward lunch. Plus, the casino pays the bus company
between $1.50 and $3 commission per customer, say gaming
experts. This summer, the Taj has been visited by over
120,000 bus customers a month; that is certain to cut into
its profit.
   And the Taj isn't alone; all casinos -- with the exception
of Harrah's, which has successfully focused on car owners --
have had to rely on costly bus customers to fill their casino
floors. The industry's challenge is to wean itself from a
client base that boosts revenue, but does little for the
bottom line.
   "The casinos have themselves in the position of just
trying to win their own money back," said Al Glasgow, a
consultant for Mr. Trump who also publishes a gaming
newsletter, Atlantic City Action. "When you just recycle the
same customer base, the value of the customer goes down," he
said.
   Casino operators said that because the Taj is now a known
quantity, it will be easier to compete against it. Before the
Taj opened, for example, many operators had to raise the
salaries of change people, security guards and cashiers
because they feared the 6,500 additional Taj workers would
create a labor shortage. Now that the Taj is laying off
workers, the operators can breathe easier, and stop worrying
about an inflationary spiral.
   "Because of the new labor demand from the Taj, all rates
went up," said Harrah's Mr. Lenczycki. "Now things are
starting to return to normal."
   Ed Tracy, chief executive officer of Mr. Trump's Atlantic
City properties, wasn't available for comment on issues
related to the casinos.
