   SAN FRANCISCO -- A consortium led by Bechtel Group Inc.
was awarded a franchise for the development of a $5 billion
high-speed rail system linking Southern California and
Nevada.
   The planned 265-mile system would connect Anaheim, Calif.,
and Las Vegas, Nev., by an elevated magnetized railway
carrying trains that can reach speeds as high as 300 miles an
hour, Bechtel said.

   The Super Speed Maglev Transport system is to be a team
project, coordinated by Bechtel and involving technology from
Transrapid International of Germany, financing by C. Itoh Co.
of Japan, and operations and maintenance services of Amtrak.
   While the system isn't expected to be completed before
1997, Bechtel said the project will eventually create 13,000
to 25,000 permanent jobs in California and 23,000 to 28,000
permanent jobs in Nevada, along with 10,000 temporary
construction jobs.
   Bechtel said it expects the system to attract some five
million round-trip riders a year by the year 2000, drawn by
fares projected at 30% less than commercial airline ticket
prices.
