   Terry Eastland's July 23 editorial-page article about the
coming Supreme Court appointment contained two items that
seemed odd to me:
   1) He writes that President Eisenhower declared his
appointment of Justice William Brennan to the court was "his
worst mistake." Historical scholars will usually concede that
statement was made about Chief Justice Earl Warren.

   2) Is there some secret message in the description of the
writer at the article's end? It says he is "completing a book
on the Reagan and Bush presidencies." Really? So soon? Should
Dan Quayle call the moving van?
