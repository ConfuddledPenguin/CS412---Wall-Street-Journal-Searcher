   DETROIT -- FirstFed Michigan Corp. said it is starting to
repurchase 750,000 shares, or about 7%, of its common stock
outstanding. The thrift holding company said it expects to
complete the buy-back program within 12 months, subject to
market conditions.
   FirstFed officials said the repurchase will be made
through open-market negotiations, but officials didn't rule
out the possibility of unsolicited negotiated transactions or
other types of repurchases. The company said any repurchased
shares would become authorized, but unissued. They will be
used for general corporate purposes.
