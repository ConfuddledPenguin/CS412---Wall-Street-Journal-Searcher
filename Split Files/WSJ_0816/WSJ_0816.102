   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it set a new
noon Eastern time deadline for the submission of
noncompetitive tenders for its securities auctions, effective
Nov. 5 at the auction of short-term bills.
   The deadline for submissions of competitive tenders will
remain at 1 p.m. Eastern time, the Treasury said in its news
release.

   Currently, all tenders are due at 1 p.m. on auction day.
   The noncompetitive deadline is being changed to permit
auction results to be released to the financial markets more
quickly, the Treasury said.
   The new deadline for noncompetitive tenders, in addition
to increasing automation of the Treasury's process for
determining auction results, should permit the department to
meet its goal of regularly releasing results by about 2 p.m.
Eastern time, the Treasury said.
   "Earlier release of auction results is expected to
facilitate secondary market trading of Treasury securities
and reduce the Treasury's financing costs," the department
said.
