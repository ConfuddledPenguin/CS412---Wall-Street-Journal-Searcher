   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission voted
to seek comment on a proposal that would make it easier for
foreign banks and insurance companies to offer securities to
U.S. investors.
   The proposal would exempt foreign banks and insurers, as
well as their finance subsidiaries, from the Investment
Company Act, which regulates mutual funds. U.S. banks and
insurance companies already are exempt from the act.

   Three years ago, the SEC exempted from the Investment
Company Act issues of debt securities and nonvoting preferred
stock by foreign banks and insurers. The proposal would
expand the exemption to include offerings or sales of all
equity securities by foreign banks and insurers.
   Foreign banks and insurers would still be required to file
registration statements and periodic reports under other
securities law. Those filings are far less onerous than the
requirements under the Investment Company Act.
   For practical purposes, however, the rule hasn't prevented
foreign banks and insurance companies from offering their
securities in the U.S. The SEC typically grants them
exemptions from the current rule.
   The agency is expected to approve the proposal after a
60-day comment period.
   The agency also voted to issue an interpretive release
stating that U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks are
exempt from the Investment Company Act for the limited
purpose of issuing securities in the U.S.
