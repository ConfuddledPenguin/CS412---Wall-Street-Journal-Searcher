   NEW YORK -- Corporate raider Carl Icahn has elbowed his
way into the nastiest corner of the junk-bond market: the
restructuring battles over financially troubled companies.
   What happens next won't be pretty, Mr. Icahn acknowledges.
But he expects to make a lot of money.

   Market estimates are that Mr. Icahn in the past four
months has snapped up nearly $800 million face value of
distressed junk bonds, buying them at a steep discount. Mr.
Icahn won't comment on that figure. But he confirms that his
big bond holdings include Southland Corp., Western Union
Corp., Gillett Holdings Inc., Leaseway Transportation Co. and
Interco Inc. All those companies have defaulted on their
debt; their bonds trade anywhere from 17 cents to 46 cents on
the dollar.
   Mr. Icahn says he smells opportunity, much as he did in
the 1980s when he stalked companies such as Texaco Inc.,
Trans World Airlines, ACF Industries Inc. and USX Corp. in
the stock market. It doesn't appear to bother him that in his
new arena he might face protracted fights with company owners
about how to settle bondholders' claims.
   "It's a travesty what some of the equity owners are
doing," Mr. Icahn fumes. "A lot of these guys believe it's
their right to stay in control even if their faulty decisions
have completely messed up a company. It's like the divine
right of kings."
   When debts must be restructured, Mr. Icahn says, he wants
to collect the best possible mix of cash, equity and new
bonds in exchange for his current holdings of defaulted
bonds. And if new part-owners can be brought in to help
"resuscitate" a company, Mr. Icahn says, he's in favor of
that, too.
   "Many of these equity owners aren't willing to give up
part of their equity and their perks to get an infusion of
new cash," Mr. Icahn complains. But he vows: "The equity
holders aren't going to roll me over like they do with some
of the other bondholders."
   For other investors, it's thrilling and a bit frightening
to watch Mr. Icahn, a reputed billionaire from his 1980s
raids, turn his teeth on other takeover specialists who took
on too much debt. "There's tremendous irony" in seeing one
raider attacking others, observes John Gordon, a junk-bond
investor at Deltec Securities Corp. "I'd love to see the
action as Carl moves forward."
   In the case of Western Union, Mr. Icahn already has taken
his first bite. During an eight-hour conference call among
top bondholders last month, Mr. Icahn repeatedly pressed
Western Union Chairman Bennett LeBow about why the ailing
telex and money-transfer company didn't put more cash into
its proposed exchange offer for holders of its defaulted 19
1/4% bonds. Mr. Icahn owns $70 million face value of these
debt securities, traders estimate.
   Mr. LeBow insisted that the company simply didn't have any
more cash, according to several people who listened in on the
conversation. But Mr. Icahn then snapped: "What about your
management contract? You're getting paid $2.5 million a year.
Why do you have to get that?"
   Bondholders say Mr. Icahn ran through a list of other
demands, including curbs on Western Union's capital spending,
so that more money would be available to repay bondholders.
Many of those points still haven't been settled; Mr. Icahn
has told other bondholders that he may block Western Union's
proposed exchange offer for its 19 1/4% notes unless terms
are modified.
   Mr. Icahn hasn't been so combative in the restructuring of
Southland, which operates 7-Eleven stores. But he weighed in
during last month's creditor talks nonetheless. "He was
pushing for more cash, more equity, more everything," says
Deltec's Mr. Gordon, who is head of the Southland
bondholders' committee. "It was pretty indiscriminate."
   Gillett Holdings could prove to be Mr. Icahn's next
battleground. The broadcasting, ski resorts and meat-packing
company missed a bond interest payment Aug. 1; it is offering
bondholders cash and new securities in exchange for some
defaulted bonds. Traders estimate that Mr. Icahn owns $50
million face value of the company's most depressed bonds,
which trade at 17 cents to 27 cents on the dollar.
   A friend of company owner George Gillett says that Mr.
Icahn's aides are loudly balking at the exchange offer. "Carl
and his guys have been giving George fits," this friend says.
Mr. Gillett and Mr. Icahn both decline to comment.
   Only in Interco has Mr. Icahn been a peaceful presence.
Interco's chief executive officer, Richard Loynd, says he met
with Mr. Icahn in June and found the raider "very pleasant,
with lots of very creative ideas for the company." Interco
already has agreed to turn over more than 70% ownership of
the company to bondholders.
   Trying to gauge Mr. Icahn's junk-bond investment record so
far is difficult. Traders estimate, though, that Mr. Icahn
has paper profits of about $30 million on his Southland
bonds, and about $10 million on his Western Union notes. They
believe he also made about $30 million in RJR Nabisco Inc.
bonds, which Mr. Icahn says he recently sold. Mr. Icahn's
Interco position, however, is believed to be a loser so far.
   Mr. Icahn says he is buying junk bonds through "several
different companies" that he controls, including ACF
Industries and Unicorn Partners. No purchases, however, are
being made by his largest affiliated company, Trans World
Airlines, he says. In the past, the TWA pilots' union has
objected to some of Mr. Icahn's investment moves.
   Some day, Mr. Icahn says, he wants to take a friendlier
role and pump fresh cash into a financially troubled company.
That could allow him to take a majority ownership stake, much
as Japan's Ito-Yokado Co. is proposing to do with Southland.
   Such a move is an intriguing possibility, says Mariel
Clemensen, director of highyield research at Citicorp. "This
market badly needs recapitalizing," Ms. Clemensen says.
"Anyone is welcome."
   So far, however, Mr. Icahn's aggressive bondholder tactics
aren't making him any more popular in corporate boardrooms.
"It's sort of a shame," Mr. Icahn says. "Some of these guys I
do like." His relations with Mr. LeBow in particular are
described by mutual friends as quite frosty now.
   All the same, Mr. Icahn, who has said he will be happy
only when he is worth $2 billion, isn't about to forgo a
chance to make more profits. "Carl has probably done more
negotiations than any living person," says Wilbur Ross, a
Rothschild Inc. investment banker who specializes in
bondholder issues. "He's got himself in a good position now."
   More fireworks may lie ahead. This week, a rumor swept the
junk-bond market that Mr. Icahn had begun buying bonds issued
by developer Donald Trump's casinos. Mr. Icahn wouldn't
confirm that. The bonds are trading as low as 42 cents on the
dollar.
