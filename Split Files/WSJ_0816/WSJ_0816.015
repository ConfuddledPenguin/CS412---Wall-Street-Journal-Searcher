   CINCINNATI -- Provident Bancorp Inc. said it would acquire
Suburban Federal Savings Bank of Cincinnati in a merger
conversion. Suburban Federal is a mutual institution, which
means it's owned by depositers and has no stock.
   Provident, a $2 billion bank holding company, said it
would offer Suburban depositers the opportunity to subscribe
to stock of Provident.
