   SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- A federal bankruptcy court here
dismissd Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings filed six months
ago by movie director Francis Ford Coppola and his company
Zoetrope Productions.
   Mr. Coppola, best known for directing the film epic "The
Godfather," had filed for personal and corporate protection
under Chapter 11 in January, seeking protection from creditor
lawsuits while he worked out a plan to pay his debts.

   Zoetrope Productions, a unit of San Francisco-based
Zoetrope Corp., then listed debts of $28.9 million and assets
of $22.2 million.
   John Peters, president of Zoetrope Corp., said in a
telephone interview yesterday that Mr. Coppola had emerged
from both his personal and corporate Chapter 11 proceedings,
and confirmed that the court had also approved a proposed
settlement of related litigation. However, he declined to
elaborate.
   Mr. Coppola had been embroiled in a dispute over a loan
from the Singer family of Canada, which financed his movie,
"One From the Heart."
   "I can't characterize it, or cast more light on its
significance at this time," Mr. Peters said of the
settlement. Mr. Coppola's attorneys couldn't be reached.
