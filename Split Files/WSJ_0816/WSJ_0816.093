   DALLAS -- The former owners of the defunct Guaranty
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas were convicted
of bank fraud and other charges after a three-month trial
that included 18 days of jury deliberations.
   Paul Sau-Ki Cheng and Edward Heath were convicted of
charges related to Guaranty Federal's financing of a Florida
property owned by the two men's closely held company, Pacific
Realty Corp. Guaranty Federal was an affiliate of Pacific
Realty until the thrift failed in September 1988 with almost
$2 billion in assets.

   Federal regulators attributed the thrift's failure to
risky real estate ventures, such as the Florida deal, and
Messrs. Cheng's and Heath's failed attempt to acquire
Houston-based U.S. Home Corp. in 1986 through Pacific Realty.
   The attempted takeover of U.S. Home resulted in about
$68.5 million in losses at Guaranty Federal, according to a
civil lawsuit pending against Messrs. Cheng and Heath and
now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which was U.S.
Home's investment banker.
   The lawsuit, filed in February in Dallas federal court by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., also alleges that
Messrs. Cheng and Heath diverted profits from trading in
government securities to entities they controlled while
saddling Guaranty Federal with losses from the trades.
   The allegations in the civil lawsuit are unrelated to the
criminal charges on which Messrs. Cheng and Heath were
convicted. The criminal charges included bank fraud,
misapplication of thrift funds and wire fraud stemming from
Guaranty Federal's $10 million loan for the Florida property.
   A portion of the charges dealt with false information
provided by Messrs. Cheng and Heath in order to obtain an
inflated appraisal of the Florida property to justify the
loan. U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Robert Hauberg, of
the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force, said the convictions of the
two men are significant because false-appraisal charges
typically are difficult to prove to a jury.
   Mr. Cheng, 35 years old, was found guilty of 10 separate
charges and faces a maximum possible sentence of 70 years in
federal prison. Edward Heath, 36, was convicted of 10 charges
and faces a maximum possible sentence of 80 years in federal
prison.
   Both men were acquitted of conspiracy and a handful of
other, lesser charges.
   Guaranty Federal and two other failed Texas thrifts were
sold in September 1988 to a joint venture led by
Temple-Inland Inc. of Diboll, Texas. Temple-Inland has since
bought out its joint-venture partners and is sole owner of
the thrift, now known as Guaranty Federal Savings Bank.
