   Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew likes to draw a
sharp line between domestic and international politics. One
of the virtues of today's interlinked world, however, is that
one nation's accomplishments can help guide others. And
though Singapore is in some respects no model polity, it does
enjoy a reputation for having produced one of the world's
cleanest governments. So when Mr. Lee explains this success,
as he did in last Thursday's National Day speech, it is worth
listening.
   The basic idea, said Mr. Lee, is that if a country wants
to recruit some of its ablest citizens into government, it
must pay them what they are worth. His warning to
Singaporeans as he prepares to step down from the prime
minister's job this fall is don't be penny-wise,
pound-foolish: "Do not try to get a government on the cheap."

   This is solid advice, worth heeding from Washington to
Manila -- and anyplace else where politicians are paid on a
scale that suggests they are either exceptionally charitable,
or expected to earn their serious pay in other ways. Mr. Lee
noted that "in most countries, men who go into politics are
officially very poorly paid. They get their rewards in other
ways, like commissions, kickbacks, patronage and perks." A
country that tries to scrimp on its politicians' salaries,
said Mr. Lee, "invites a lot of hypocrisy, fiddling and
eventually dishonesty and corruption.
   High pay alone won't guarantee integrity in government, of
course. It is also vital to foster a tradition of loyal
dissent, and vigorous competition for political office. A
group of entrenched legislators -- such as the current U.S.
Congress -- tends to end up serving special interests rather
than the national good. Witness the Savings and Loan
disaster, the uncuttable budget or the protectionist fervor
that periodically sweeps Congress.
   What Mr. Lee is advancing, however, is the sensible view
that government is just one of many employers competing in
the marketplace. To attract and keep good people, it is
important to take into account what they might be able to
earn with similar skills and energy in the private sector.
Otherwise a country risks the kind of defection from
government, and unwillingness to serve, that increasingly
troubles, say, the Philippines.
   Beyond attracting able men and women, decent salaries also
help reduce temptation to skim off something on the side, or
trade favors for political influence. The need to supplement
a political pittance can too easily start to tilt a
politician's judgment. The result, both in wasted resources
and slipping standards, can be quantum jumps costlier than
simply paying good people what they are worth.
