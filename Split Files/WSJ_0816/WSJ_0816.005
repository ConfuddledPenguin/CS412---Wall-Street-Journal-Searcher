   WASHINGTON -- A few days ago, the Army's top brass ordered
commanders world-wide to begin estimating the cost of
Operation Desert Shield. Among the working assumptions in the
cable, one was particularly sobering: that troops would be
based in the desert for six months.
   The cable contained some further unsettling orders. "Cease
all nonessential/discretionary expenditures," it ordered.
"Identify resulting funds which can be returned to
headquarters."

   As prospects increase for a drawn-out face-off with Iraq
in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, Pentagon spending plans are
being quickly outpaced. Simply ordering the battleship
Wisconsin to steam to the Mideast at a faster speed, for
instance, will burn up an estimated $500,000 of extra fuel.
Taking account of the unexpected fuel costs, the need for
extra spare parts and the expense of stepped-up training, the
Persian Gulf mission could cost $3 billion to $5 billion --
possibly much more, depending on how long it lasts.
   The cost burden has touched off a new round of
inter-service bickering. The Army, for instance, is demanding
that some ships sit idle for days while waiting to pick up
tanks and troops, provoking complaints from the Navy. The Air
Force, for its part, is still feuding with the Army over the
cost of airlifting troops for last year's invasion of Panama.
Pentagon planners, who just last month were studying spending
cuts, are now also preparing to write a supplemental
appropriations bill to cover suddenly increased costs.
   "The cost is clearly going to be heavy," says George
Carver, a former high-ranking State Department and Central
Intelligence Agency official now at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies. "The president clearly is prepared
to do whatever is necessary, including calling up reserves,
to get the job done."
   During a briefing inside the Pentagon's "tank" -- a room
shielded from electronic eavesdropping -- President Bush
faced some difficult choices of his own. The military wants
him to order the largest mobilization of reservists in almost
30 years -- adding not only to the financial burden but to
the domestic political risk as well.
   Such a sensitive step -- comparable in some ways to
declaring a national emergency -- could intensify public
anxiety and possibly weaken the public consensus behind the
"line in the sand" that President Bush has drawn for Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. Calling up the reserves "makes perfect sense
from a military standpoint," says one Pentagon official, "but
undoubtedly it will shock a lot of people by pointing out the
seriousness of the situation."
   But the complexities of a long-term commitment in Saudi
Arabia demand a massive reserve deployment, military
officials say. For every front-line tank, or infantry unit
digging in at the Iraqi border, the Army must mobilize at
least as many troops to help feed, arm and otherwise support
those soldiers. That will require activating entire reserve
brigades, spending several weeks training and equipping those
troops for the harsh desert environment, and then deploying
many of them to Saudi Arabia for at least several months.
   The back-up troops, which could number 60,000 or more in
this first phase, run the gamut from cooks and truck drivers
to communications technicians and intelligence analysts. Gen.
Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, and other military
leaders argue that pressing them into service fast is the
only way of keeping the Middle East crisis from stripping
support units from active-duty forces currently stationed in
Europe or the U.S.
   Government and outside analysts agree that the escalating
deployment poses the most daunting financial and logistical
problems the Pentagon has confronted since Vietnam. During
peak times, giant C-5 and C-141 cargo planes have been
landing every 10 minutes in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon is
chartering commercial jumbo jets to ferry troops, and it has
activated at least 16 ships to carry larger loads on the
12,000-mile voyage.
   For all the feverish, round-the-clock activity, it will
still take at least two weeks for the most potent U.S. tanks
to reach the scene. When they do arrive, it remains to be
seen how troops from the U.S., Britain, Egypt, Morocco, Syria
and Pakistan will be melded to form a single, coherent force
-- much less what portion of the overall cost the Saudi
government, not to mention the Germans or Japanese or other
beneficiaries of the mission, will be willing to pick up.
   Back home, the services are struggling to get a handle on
the costs and jockeying for ways to cushion the impact on
their accounts. "When the services estimate costs," says Mr.
Carver, "it's often an exercise in creative billing."
   So far, Pentagon officials insist, bureaucratic infighting
hasn't prevented any badly needed hardware or soldiers from
leaving the U.S. But there has been plenty of intramural
tension.
   A few days ago, commanders of the Army's 24th Mechanized
Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, Ga., lambasted Navy
officers because they failed to have specially equipped
transport ships tied up at the dock waiting to take troops to
the Middle East. Navy brass countered that it would be
expensive and unnecessary to have ships bobbing empty for
days while troops, 80-ton tanks and hundreds of armored
fighting vehicles were readied for loading.
   The invasion of Panama played a big part in helping
prepare Military Airlift Command crews for the current
situation, says Col. Robert Duignan, deputy commander for
operations for a wing of more than two dozen C-141s manned by
reservists and based at Andrews Air Force Base in
Washington's Maryland suburbs. "We learn important lessons .
. . every time there is that kind of increased military
activity," he says.
   But this time, the sheer task of tracking expenses is
mind-boggling. The two-page internal Army memo, which lays
out rules for estimating costs, gives commanders a detailed
29-point checklist to follow. The items include "operational
rations," porthandling costs, stepped-up maintenance efforts
and "incremental" increases in flying hours for helicopters.
   The cost projections, which must be updated every two
weeks, also must include a "brief narrative description" of
extra expenses incurred for such things as "sundries packs"
and "evacuation of personnel."
