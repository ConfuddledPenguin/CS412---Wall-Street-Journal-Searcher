   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association disclosed that its proposal to sell its $3
billion junk-bond portfolio will cost it at least $50
million, and that its retail deposit base has eroded by
nearly $250 million in the last four months.
   Separately, a federal appeals court dealt a setback to
Columbia's former chief executive officer, Thomas Spiegel, in
his effort to avoid posting $21 million in an escrow account
as part of defending against government charges that he
squandered Columbia assets for his personal use.

   The disclosures about Columbia were made in its latest
quarterly report to the Office of Thrift Supervision, and
point up the depth of the challenge facing current management
in trying to obtain regulator approval for the bond
transaction and to keep the troubled institution afloat.
   As previously reported, Columbia agreed last month to sell
the bond portfolio to a partnership affiliated with
Toronto-based Gordon Investment Corp. for slightly more than
the book value of the bonds. The transaction is scheduled to
close on Oct. 2, but regulators must first approve it by
Sept. 20. Columbia's board also hasn't formally approved the
transaction, which has already been under attack for being
too favorable to the buyer because of generous financing
terms.
   But in the regulatory filing, Columbia said that after
fees and other factors, the transaction would add "in excess
of $50 million" to its already considerable shareholder
deficit of $350 million. Among other factors, Columbia is
understood to be paying its financial adviser on the
transaction, First Boston Corp., an $11 million fee. In
addition, the loss reflects the fact that terms of the sale
give the Gordon group all bond interest income that is
received after closing, even covering periods in which
Columbia was the actual owner of the bonds.
   Columbia officials continued to strongly defend the
transaction. Spokesman Charles A. Yamarone said: "We feel
that the proposed deal is the best available transaction to
dispose of the bonds in their entirety."
   The quarterly filing also notes that Columbia expects to
realize a gain in excess of $55 million from selling an
equity stake in Motel 6 L.P. of Dallas as part of a pending
tender offer for the hotel concern by Accor S.A. of France.
   Those funds are separate from the $150 million to $250
million in additional gains that Columbia expects to realize
as part of selling other equity securities it obtained in
conjunction with building its junk portfolio. Columbia
officials consider those gains to be a crucial element of
what is widely considered to be a long-shot attempt to save
the thrift from federal seizure.
   Columbia must sell the junk bonds because of a provision
of the thrift bailout law.
   Columbia also reported in the regulatory filing that
retail deposits declined by $248.6 million for the four
months ended July 31, reflecting depositor concern over its
condition. The thrift has lost about 16% of its $2.8 billion
retail base since year end. Nonetheless, Mr. Yamarone
asserted that Columbia is in a strong liquidity position, in
part because of a plan to sell $500 million in
mortgage-backed securities this month.
   On Tuesday, Columbia reported a net loss of $136.5
million, or $6.78 a share, for the second quarter.
   Meanwhile, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a
lower-court order that permanently blocked the Office of
Thrift Supervision from requiring Mr. Spiegel to put the $21
million in escrow. As reported, Los Angeles federal Judge
Stephen Wilson on Aug. 3 had held that the OTS had exceeded
its authority in making the escrow demand. The appeals court
indicated a hearing on the issue wouldn't be held until
November. Mr. Spiegel's lawyers have asked the court to
clarify whether he must escrow any of the money before the
hearing.
