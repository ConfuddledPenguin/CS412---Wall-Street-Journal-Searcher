   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against the mark after falling
to a historical low on profit-taking. Rumors of central bank
intervention helped prop up the greenback.
   The only clear winner, dealers said, was the yen, which
gained against all major currencies. High-yield currencies,
such as the British pound and the Canadian dollar, also
benefited.

   The dollar was last quoted in New York at 1.5660 marks and
1.3065 Swiss francs, up from 1.5645 marks and 1.3040 francs
late Tuesday in New York.
   The U.S. currency, however, declined to 147.65 yen from
148.78 yen in New York late Tuesday. And sterling closed at
$1.9006, up from $1.8981 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 147.55 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
147.85 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5688 marks; in Tokyo Wednesday, it closed at 1.5618 marks.
   David Gilmore, a foreign exchange analyst for McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei, said after having bought the dollar for
two weeks in reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the New
York market Tuesday and other centers yesterday were
"perfectly set up for this kind of move" to a new, post-World
War II low against the mark.
   "We haven't been selling dollars for some time," he said.
Late Tuesday, the possibility of a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf standoff was dangled before financial markets,
providing the opportunity that itchy sellers had been waiting
for.
   About 45 minutes after New York trading rooms got into
full swing yesterday, the dollar hit 1.5525 marks, almost an
entire pfennig below its previous, all-time bottom of 1.5615
marks set on Jan. 4, 1988. After that, it was all uphill.
   Some controversy surrounded the dollar's sharp rebound.
The level of 1.5525 marks -- though it will now take on
importance -- wasn't considered a technical support prior to
yesterday, so the reversal scared up rumors concerning just
about every foreign-exchange fear.
   Rumors in the U.S. and U.K. that the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York had intervened to buy dollars were matched in
Germany by talk that the Deutsche Bundesbank had done the
same. New York dealers who never believed the Fed rumor were
nevertheless convinced by rumors that some large speculative
players, led by Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, were
taking profits on the dollar's decline.
   What was certain, said Bill Arnold, Chemical Bank's chief
dealer, was that after their dollar-bashing Tuesday, New York
traders had finally become short, or oversold, on dollars and
wanted to take their pay. "It was a correction in the trend.
The dollar comes down five pfennigs; it has to come up one
pfennig."
   Added Erik Lehtis, a New York trader for France's Credit
Agricole, "there were a lot of nervous people who were short
dollars and saw a good opportunity to take profits."
   The dollar was already creeping higher when rumors about
central bank intervention spread through the market about 10
a.m. EDT and pushed the dollar even higher. The New York Fed
calls dealers every morning to check levels and did so again
yesterday, said Mr. Gilmore of McCarthy Crisanti.
   "Obviously, someone who wanted to take more profits
decided to call the checking a Fed intervention," he
suggested.
   A U.S. central bank spokesman declined to comment on the
rumor, in accordance with policy.
   Chemical Bank's Mr. Arnold said he dismissed the rumor as
spurious. "Everyone knows the Fed doesn't intervene without
the Treasury's backing and the Treasury isn't interested in a
higher dollar."
   A cheaper dollar, added Mr. Gilmore, "fits in the
Treasury's game plan" to stimulate the export sector of the
U.S. economy.
   Meanwhile, the Bundesbank, with its eye on the price
pressures caused by the union of the two Germanys, wants the
strongest mark it can get, Mr. Arnold said.
   As for the dollar, Mr. Lehtis of Credit Agricole, said
"the U.S. economy is bad but may not be as bad as everyone is
moaning and groaning about." The prospect of a U.S. recession
has been the primary reason for the dollar's weakness, along
with the prospect that the Fed will ease credit policy to
stave off that recession.
   New evidence released yesterday was inconclusive. The rate
of U.S. industrial production didn't budge in July, after
gearing up by 0.4% in June and 0.6% in May. But the news that
business inventories shrank by 0.4% in June suggested that
U.S. factories have room to pick up the pace.
   Along with the dollar, the mark, pound, and Swiss franc
all fell against the Japanese currency to 94.28 yen, 280.54
yen and 112.90 yen, respectively, from 95.14 yen, 282.37 yen
and 114.13 yen Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $402.60 an ounce, down $2.20. Estimated
volume was a heavy 5.8 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$403.75 an ounce.
