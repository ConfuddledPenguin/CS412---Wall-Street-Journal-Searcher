   NEW YORK -- An investment group headed by Peter J.
Solomon, former vice chairman at Shearson Lehman Hutton, has
purchased 37 Wickes Lumber Co. retail outlets in the
Southeast. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
   The lumber and building-supplies facilities, which
generated sales of $160 million in 1989, represent the first
acquisition by the Peter J. Solomon Co. The new venture, to
be called Leeds Building Products, will be based in Atlanta
and run by Kenneth L. Miron, a member of Mr. Solomon's
investment group.

   The purchase will leave Vernon Hills, Ill.-based Wickes
Lumber with 152 retail outlets nationwide.
   The purchase will "notably reduce" the debt incurred by
the company in a $300 million 1988 management buy-out,
according to Ric Morphet, Wickes senior vice president of
administration.
