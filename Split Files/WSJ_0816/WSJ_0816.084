   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it's temporarily
idling two assembly plants and extending a temporary shutdown
of another in the face of sagging sales.
   The No.2-ranked U.S. auto maker is struggling with a slump
in car sales. The latest production cuts indicate that Ford
isn't expecting an upturn soon in sales of its autos.

   The shutdowns will idle a combined 7,500 hourly employees
at the three plants. The Atlanta plant, which builds the
midsized Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, and the Kansas City,
Mo., plant that builds the compact Ford Tempo and Mercury
Topaz will be idled the week beginning next Monday.
   The Lorain, Ohio, plant that builds the Ford Thunderbird
and Mercury Cougar midsized coupes isn't working this week
and will remain closed the week beginning Monday because of a
shortage of interior trim materials, Ford said. The plant had
been scheduled to reopen Monday.
   Ford's share of the car market has fallen 1.8 percentage
points to 20.8% in the first seven months of the year,
largely reflecting an 11.8% drop in sales of its domestic
cars.
   In the latest 10-day period, sales of the Tempo skidded
23.6% while sales of the Thunderbird plunged 45.9%. Taurus
sales rose 24.4% in the latest 10-day period, but are down
9.5% for the year.
   The production cuts come at a time when Ford's dealer
inventory levels are relatively low. At July 31, inventory
levels ranged from a 50-day supply for the Sable to a 75-day
supply for the Thunderbird. About a 60-to-65-day supply is
considered an ideal inventory level in the industry.
   Despite the lean inventories, dealers have been reluctant
to order new cars in the face of weak sales. That has forced
Ford, since April 1, to order one-week shutdowns at several
North American car assembly plants, including the two
factories that build the Taurus and Sable.
   In late May, Ford told dealers in a letter that if they
continued to hold back on orders, "it could lead to
substantial dealer {product} flow interruptions."
   Ford indicated that the shutdowns could cut a total of
about 20,200 cars from its third-quarter production
schedules.
