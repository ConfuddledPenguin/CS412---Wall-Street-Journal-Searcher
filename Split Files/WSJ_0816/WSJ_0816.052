   CLEVELAND -- National City Corp. said a subsidiary, First
National Bank of Louisville, was awarded a judgment of $21.7
million, plus interest, against insurance companies that
provided coverage for employee fraud.
   The Federal District Court in New Orleans instructed Aetna
Casualty &amp; Surety Co., a unit of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.,
Hartford, Conn., and the Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.,
Warren, N.J., to pay the sum to First National Bank of
Louisville under blanket bond policies. The judgment, which
is subject to appeal, is for the full amount of the insurance
coverage purchased by the bank, National City said.

   First National filed the claim to recover a portion of its
losses on eight loans totaling $30 million that the bank made
in 1985 and 1986. The bank said Kevin L. DeWitt, then a loan
officer in the bank's real estate loan department, falsified
credit information and other documents, leading the bank to
make loans to borrowers who weren't creditworthy. The bank
said it was able to prove that Mr. DeWitt received at least
$40,000 for his help in arranging the loans.
   Mr. DeWitt last February pleaded guilty to felony charges
of falsifying bank documents, but withdrew his plea when a
U.S. district judge in Louisville refused to accept a plea
bargain that the judge said was too lenient. Mr. DeWitt, who
is awaiting trial on those charges, couldn't be reached for
comment. His attorney declined to comment.
   Aetna said it hasn't decided whether to appeal the
judgment, and attorneys for Chubb couldn't be reached.
