   NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices continued to dance to
the tune of the Mideast, gyrating through the day before
ending with tiny gains.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds ended up 1/8 point, or $1.25
for each $1,000 of face amount, in thin trading. Stock prices
followed the bond market in lock step. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average eked out a 0.50 point rise to 2748.27. The
dollar ended mixed.

   Bonds jumped more than half a point early in the day on
reports that Iraq might consider leaving Kuwait in return for
a freeze in the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
Oil prices drifted lower on the news. Then President Bush
said he sees no hope of a diplomatic solution until Iraqi
troops leave Kuwait. That helped halt the slide in oil prices
and sent bonds tumbling nearly a full point.
   "The bond market is on a teeter-totter," said Roberta
Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager at Banc One Asset
Management Corp. "One minute it's focusing on political
developments, the next on what's going on in our economy,"
she said.
   Bond prices rose early in the day in part on the news that
July industrial production was unchanged from the June level.
That cheered investors who expected a slight rise. Any
evidence pointing to a weaker economy tends to calm fears
that inflation will rise and erode the value of fixed-income
investments.
   But as soon as Mr. Bush came out later in the morning with
his hawkish comments, Ms. Olson said, traders decided that
"we still have a hot potato on our hands" in the Mideast and
took profits.
   The notion that peace was just around the corner helped
the stock market as well early on, pushing the Dow
industrials up more than 20 points. "There was this breath of
fresh air," said Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp., "and investors came out of the
bunkers." But Mr. Bush's comments and the subsequent bond
market reaction quickly erased the gain.
   The dollar started the day by resuming the previous day's
sharp decline, then turned around and rose on indications
that the Mideast turmoil wasn't over.
   But several currency traders said they wouldn't bet that
Mr. Bush's saber rattling will protect the dollar long from
further declines because of weakness in the U.S. economy.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 135.2 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 887 to 619.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
eased to 8.76%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5660 marks and 147.65 yen, compared
with 1.5645 marks and 148.78 yen Tuesday.
