   From a July 2 interview on CNN's Moneyweek with John Shad,
the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
who then served briefly as chairman of Drexel Burnham
Lambert. He was asked why the firm went into liquidation so
soon after he joined:

   Bill Hartley: Ten months later Drexel went into
bankruptcy. What was wrong? What did you find? What was the
most shocking to you when you got there? What did you see?
   Mr. Shad: Well, I wasn't really shocked because I had
spent a month and a half working at it before I got involved.
But it was -- I'd say the thing I didn't anticipate that had
a lot to do with the collapse of the firm ultimately was the
S&amp;L bailout bill last August, which included a provision that
required the S&amp;Ls to liquidate their high-yield bond
positions, which I don't think Congress anticipated would
cause such an immediate negative reaction in the whole
market.
