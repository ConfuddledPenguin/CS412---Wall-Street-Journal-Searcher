   SILICON VALLEY GROUP Inc., San Jose, Calif., said it filed
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for a proposed public offering next month of three
million common shares, including 2.4 million in the U.S. and
600,000 abroad. The semiconductor processing equipment maker
said it plans to use about half of the proceeds to retire
debt incurred in its May 1990 acquisition of the Optical
Lithography operations of Perkin-Elmer Corp., and to use the
balance for working capital. The U.S. offering will be
managed by Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, Montgomery
Securities and Cowen & Co.; the international offering by
Prudential-Bache Securities (UK) Inc., Montgomery Securities
and Cowen. Silicon Valley Group was at the center of an
international dispute earlier this year, when its bid for the
Perkin-Elmer unit blocked the unit's sale to Nikon Corp. of
Japan.
