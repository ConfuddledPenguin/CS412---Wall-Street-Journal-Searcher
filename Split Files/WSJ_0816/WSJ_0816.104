   HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines said it will cut
fares for flights after Labor Day, matching reductions
already announced by several other major carriers.
   The carrier said it will lower its discount fares for fall
vacation travel in the continental U.S. by an average of 30%.

   Continental said the lowered fares will be exempt from a
pending 5.3% increase that the carrier and several others
plan to implement in about a week to defray the rising costs
of jet fuel.
   The airline's reduced fares apply to round-trip tickets
purchased by Aug. 29 for travel between Sept. 5 and Dec. 16,
excluding the five days around Thanksgiving.
   On Tuesday, United, Northwest and American offered lower
fares in response to the post-Labor Day fare cuts announced
Monday by Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines.
   The 5.3% fare increases were to have gone into effect
yesterday, but Continental, United Airlines and Northwest
Airlines said they were delaying the increases until
Wednesday. American postponed the increases until next
Thursday.
   The carriers said they were taking the action for
competitive reasons and that the delay meant they would
absorb higher fuel costs for the time being.
