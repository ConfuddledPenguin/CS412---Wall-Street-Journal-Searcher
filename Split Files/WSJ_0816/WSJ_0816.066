   Inspired by the success of the annual imitation Ernest
Hemingway contest, American Airlines' in-flight magazine
decided to launch its own imitation this year and came up
with what seemed like a natural -- a William Faulkner
write-alike competition.
   But imitation wasn't the sincerest form of flattery as far
as Mark Grody was concerned. "How disappointing you couldn't
come up with an original idea," wrote Mr. Grody, whose public
relations firm coordinated the Hemingway contest, which was
sponsored by Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill, a restaurant
chain.

   Mr. Grody's pique doesn't bother Doug Crichton, editor of
American Way, the inflight magazine that sponsored the
Faulkner competition, along with a Faulkner newsletter run by
the late author's niece. In fact, he says, it's highly
appropriate. "Hemingway and Faulkner would have loved it," he
says. "They didn't like each other, or each other's writing."
   In that case, Papa would probably get apoplectic reading
the winning entries in the first Bad Faulkner contest.
Consider this, from a piece called "As I Lay Dieting," by Sam
Staggs, a Philadelphia novelist: "then I seed her eatin hog
meat, it was pig killin time, the wine of Euboeleus, she
piled her plate full and red eye gravy on it like the
vertiginous overflow of a bayou in spring. . ."
   All the entries violate, as Faulkner did, Hemingway's
golden rule: short sentences. This, for instance, spewed
forth from Jerome Richard, a Seattle free-lance writer: "He
paced the corner where he had waited for her before not once
or even twice but every one of the dozen or so times they
arranged to meet like this in broad daylight as if defying
not just her ancestors and his but fate itself which seemed,
must have decreed that no Capwell would ever marry a
Tomlinson and produce out of their sweating concupiscence. .
." The sentence goes on for another three hundred words.
   The imitation Faulkner contest will go on, too.
Manuscripts are already being solicited for next year.
   As for the imitation Hemingway contest, it was put to rest
after 11 years, done in by success. "We were getting over
2,500 entries a year, and the cost just got astronomical,"
says Mr. Grody.
   By the way, he now insists, somewhat sheepishly, that his
criticism of the Faulkner contest was tongue-in-cheek. Says
he: "All the best to Bad Faulkner."
