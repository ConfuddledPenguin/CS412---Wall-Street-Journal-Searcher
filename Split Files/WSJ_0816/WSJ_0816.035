   Your July 11 page-one article "Costly Advice: Wall
Streeters Helped Interco Defeat Raiders -- but at a Heavy
Price" reminded me that hardly a day goes by that you don't
report several instances of why this country is in economic
decline.
   Far too many people, far too much time and far too many
resources are devoted to innovative accounting, tax
avoidance, mergers, acquisitions and litigation. U.S.
industry is headed, in the main, by "professional" managers
who have no background in or dedication to the product or
service lines of their companies. Profit, risk aversion and
perks seem to be their foremost priorities. Meanwhile in
Europe and Japan, managers lead their companies through
technological and institutional innovations.

   Several years ago, Robert B. Reich characterized this
phenomenon in his book "The Next American Frontier." He
accused today's managers of having "replaced product
entrepreneurialism with paper entrepreneurialism."
