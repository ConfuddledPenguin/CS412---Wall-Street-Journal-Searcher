   The solution to "AWFUL TV," suggests Robert Goldberg in
his July 23 Leisure &amp; Arts article, is for parents to unplug
the television set.
   Society's problem is that TV is the parent to millions of
kids -- latchkey kids, one-parent kids, two-parents-working
kids. Mr. Goldberg says that the average family watches seven
hours of TV a day. How much do poor families watch? How many
poor kids get to bed before the 8 p.m. start of adult
programming?

   Parents, of course, teach mostly by example. So what does
our TV parent teach? Sex, violence and stupidity. Moreover,
the voltage increases every season. For the coming season,
Mr. Goldberg tells us, CBS President Howard Stringer has
promised to exchange "bland" and "dull" for "coarse" and
"crude."
   Why do we need programs so stimulating that they glue us
to our TV sets? The British have dull TV, and good manners.
The Japanese have silly TV, and a powerful work ethic.
Neither have the violent, salacious fare so readily available
on American TV.
   Yes, Mr. Goldberg, I agree that the real problem is from
"the neck up." But if we're inputting garbage into the
tender, receptive brains of children, to use a computer
analogy, what do we expect for output? And what are the
consequences to our society?
