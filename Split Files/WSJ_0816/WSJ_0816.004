   I never cease to be amazed that the American people, and
especially our political and business leaders, continue to
miss the mark when it comes to making needed changes ("Tricky
Issue: Thrift Scandal, Viewed as Political Dynamite, Is Slow
to Detonate" page one, July 13).
   The problem is not that major responsibility for the
thrift debacle should be placed on either Democrats or
Republicans. The real problem is -- given man's nature to
take unfair advantage of his fellow men -- that any type of
government subsidy serves as an open invitation for would-be
plunderers to swarm in.

   Until we get the federal government out of subsidizing
financial institutions, we will continue having one scandal
after another. Of course, the same thing can be said for
government subsidies or "aid" to farmers, small businesses,
big corporations, the poor, the homeless, the blind, the
aged.
   There is only one solution to the scandals and scams, and
that is to limit the role of civil government to the one and
only job it is competent to do: maintain law and order so
that people can be free to serve each other in an atmosphere
of free competition.

   Your article reminds me about your very comprehensive
stories several years ago about Democrats Jim Wright, former
House speaker, and Tony Coehlo, former majority whip, and
their involvement in the S&amp;L scandal.
   To now quote Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown and
then not publish a quote from the Republican National
chairman shows your unfairness. Kevin Phillips does not speak
for the Republican Party.
   We are all angry about the S&amp;L mess, but any insinuation
that President Bush is the person most responsible ignores
history and the facts.
   This problem was created by stupid tax loopholes and S&amp;L
regulations, created by a Democratic Congress to benefit
real-estate wheelers and dealers.
