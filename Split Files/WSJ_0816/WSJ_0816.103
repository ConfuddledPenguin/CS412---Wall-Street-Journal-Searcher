   NEW YORK -- Small investors should be wary of promoters
who are exploiting the Middle East crisis to push bogus oil,
gas and precious metals investments, three states warned.
   Attorneys general for Missouri, New Hampshire and New York
and members of the North American Securities Administrators
Association Inc. issued "Investor Bulletins" calling
attention to what they called a "new rash of `boilerroom'
salespeople" seeking to exploit the Middle East situation.

   "Today the con artist's best friend is a headline or
television news report from the Mideast that refers to a
disruption of oil supplies to the United States," the
officials said.
   Typically, customers are encouraged to invest $5,000,
$10,000 or more in units of partnerships to profit from
rising oil prices, or in precious metals, which tend to rise
in price in times of unstable economic news.
   In Missouri, Secretary of State Roy Blunt said a Florida
man had been arrested on charges of selling shares in a
nonexistent Pennsylvania pipeline, using Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait to encourage purchasers.
