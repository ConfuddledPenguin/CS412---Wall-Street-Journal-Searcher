   SEATTLE -- Washington Energy Co. said its Washington
Natural Gas Co. unit reached an out-of-court settlement with
former holders of its Series D and E preferred stock.
   The preferred holders were identified as Ford Motor Credit
Co., MDFC Equipment Leasing Co., Westinghouse Credit Corp.
and Nationwide Life Insurance Co. and its affiliates.

   The issue arose from the company's decision in January
1987 to repurchase the preferred shares prior to their
maturity, based on the utility's evaluation of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986. However, a spokeswoman said the preferred owners
objected to terms of the repurchase.
   The settlement, pending a definitive agreement, would
result in a charge against earnings of about 17 cents a
share, or $2.6 million after taxes, for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30. The company has about 16 million shares
outstanding.
   Washington Energy had profit of $3.3 million, or 17 cents
a share, in the most recent quarter ended June 30.
   The utility company's stock closed at $20.125, down 25
cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
