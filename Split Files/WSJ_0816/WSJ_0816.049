   Thursday, Aug. 16, 10:30-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air
dates and times vary so check local listings): "Best
Friends," a tart drama of adultery built around an encounter
between a mistress and a poisonously understanding wife. If
the playlet is slight, and it is, the players and the
dialogue are sharp, and even daring in a civilized way.

   Friday, Aug. 17, 7-8:33 p.m. EDT., on The Disney Channel:
"The Little Kidnappers," the story of two orphaned Scottish
boys sent to live with their embittered grandfather. If that
outline sounds like a sentimental children's story, that's
exactly what this is, but forebodings are unnecessary. There
is such a thing as high-class sentimentality and that too is
what this is. Charlton Heston plays the dour grandfather to
the two Scottish lads.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Aug. 19, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Wolves," a
National Audobon Society Special, narrated by Robert Redford.
The first part chronicles the depressing story of the wolf's
near total extermination in the U.S., thanks to the bounty
hunters, trappers and poisoners who spread strychnine in wolf
habitats. Less than 1% of our wolf population survives, most
of it in the forests of Northern Minnesota, the documentary
reveals. This occasionally talky but absorbing hour will
increase the number of wolf fans, of which there are
doubtless not yet a great number in the world. One of the
film's most memorable moments is the sight of a bunch of
young red wolf pups, nurtured in the conservationists'
breeding pens, taking their first uncertain steps into the
wild.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Aug. 19, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on HBO: "Women and Men:
Stories of Seduction," a trilogy of dramatized short stories.
The best by far is "The Man in the Brooks Brothers Suit," the
Mary McCarthy story about a young woman journalist, a '30s
radical, who meets a married businessman with nothing but
scorn for her political opinions. In the course of their
encounter aboard a train, the virile and forthright
businessman succeeds not only in bedding the arrogant radical
but also destroys her regard for her radical bohemian fiance.
Mary McCarthy, of course, was writing in that blessed era
when you still could count on a businessman to proselytize
for greed and personal hygiene, whereas now, some of the
foremost fans of bohemianism can be found in executive
suites. Elizabeth McGovern is thoroughly convincing as the
young woman, and Beau Bridges is even better as the anchored
banker. It helps, of course, that this is based on a superior
piece of fiction, but that can't be said of "Dusk Before
Fireworks," Dorothy Parker's flapper-age tale of a gigolo and
a lady. Splendid period costumes and sets, alas, are not
enough. The female lead, young, pouty Molly Ringwald, is so
unalterably a creature of her time, that to see her struggle
with the dialogue and style meant for a hot number from the
'20s is a sight almost too cruel to be borne. "Hills Like
White Elephants," a Hemingway story about an imminent
abortion, stars Melanie Griffith, a top hand at inarticulate
sulking, and James Woods, of whom likewise. Both do capital
jobs portraying lovers at the end of the same tether.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Aug. 22, 9:30-10 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Working It
Out," part of NBC's effort to build an early audience for its
new fall series. This one, starring Jane Curtin, is about the
adventures of the formerly married, as they search for love
and try to nurture mouthy children. If this sounds familiar
it is because you have seen all this before in, among other
series, "Kate and Allie," also starring Jane Curtin. It looks
as though Ms. Curtin's considerable comedic gifts will carry
this series as well. In the first episode, the divorcee in
question attends a cooking class, where she meets a divorced
man also on the prowl while both of them pretend to prepare
pasta from scratch. Any team of actors and scriptwriters who
could extrude something appealing from this weary mess of
sitcom ingredients, as this crowd seems to have done,
deserves a commendation.
                                                                                                       

   Friday, Aug. 24, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Evening at Pops,"
a musical theater special featuring the songs of Jerome Kern,
Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter and others. The special part is
that all the songs are offered in their original
arrangements. You won't believe how good Irving Caesar and
Vincent Youmans's "Tea for Two" can sound when played the way
they wrote it. Jerome Kern's "They Didn't Believe Me,"
rendered as it first was for the stage, has a beauty most of
the audience will not have heard before. Then there is David
Gaines's version of "Night and Day." It was nice to see that
among the audience enjoying this glorious sound were numbers
of young children whose eardrums evidently have not yet been
perforated by rock music.
