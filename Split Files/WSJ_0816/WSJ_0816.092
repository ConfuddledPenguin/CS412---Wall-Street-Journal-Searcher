   NEW YORK -- The bond market bounced around yesterday, with
prices of long-term issues rising and falling in the inverse
direction of oil prices.
   "It was a volatile day of trading," said Kevin Flanagan,
money market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The bond
market changed directions several times, he said, as crude
oil price gyrated wildly in reaction to continuously changing
news concerning the Persian Gulf crisis.

   In early trading, when oil prices fell on rumors that
Mideast tensions were easing, the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond jumped nearly 3/4 point. That amounted to a gain
of $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   Two economic reports released by the Federal Reserve
spurred some buying in the bond market because they provided
additional evidence that the economy is losing momentum. The
report on industrial production said that output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities was flat in July. The
Fed also reported that industry used less of its capacity in
July production than it had in June, another indication of
slack.
   Bond prices suddenly reversed directions and fell one full
point as crude oil futures prices spiked up one dollar a
barrel to about $26.75. Declining prices of bond futures
exacerbated selling in the cash market.
   The bond market reversed directions again in midafternoon
as oil prices fell to about $26 a barrel on reports that
Saudi Arabia is working on a formula to allow the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce 22.5
million barrels a day, just below the production rate before
the Kuwait invasion.
   Turmoil in the Middle East has driven oil prices higher in
recent weeks, increasing the chances that inflation will
accelerate, which reduces the value of fixed-income
investments such as bonds.
   After zigzagging all day long, both oil and bond prices
actually finished little changed from Tuesday's closing
prices.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/8 point higher on the
day while the issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.76% from 8.77% on
Tuesday.
   Yesterday's volatility may have worried some investors,
but traders and dealers were in good spirits.
   "It was a good professional trading day," said Steven I.
Saslow, a trading manager at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc.
"Traders tend to complain if nothing is going on because
there's no opportunity {to make much money}. But the dealer
community makes more money when there is volatility than when
things are quiet." That's because customers don't haggle much
over trading costs when prices are changing rapidly for fear
that the market will move against them.
   Analysts expect the bond market to remain somewhat
volatile in the near term as events in the Middle East
continue to unfold and as economic reports fail to provide
new clues about how the economy is faring.
   "Investors are groping for some direction," said Dean
Witter's Mr. Flanagan. "Everybody is trying to figure out
where the economy is heading. Some say we're in a recession
right now, others say we'll have a recession in a month or
two and others believe we aren't in a recession and won't
have a recession." For investors, he said, "there is still a
lot of confusion."
   On the economic calendar for today are reports on July
consumer prices, real earnings and housing starts. Also due
today are weekly claims for unemployment insurance.
   The consumer price index is expected to have risen 0.3% in
July, while housing starts are seen unchanged at a 1.18
millionunit rate, according to surveys of economists by Dow
Jones Capital Markets Report.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   It was a volatile day of trading for long-term bonds
yesterday, but short-term securities posted just modest
prices moves during yesterday's session.
   The benchmark 30-year bond -- which rose as much as 3/4
point and fell as much as one point yesterday -- ended at a
price of 99 25/32, up from 99 21/32 on Tuesday. The yield on
the benchmark bonds eased slightly to 8.76% from 8.77%.
   Two-year notes, however, were unchanged at a price of 100
3/32 to yield 7.93%.
   Treasury bills also were little changed from Tuesday. The
discount rate on three-month bills was 7.46% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.69% while the rate on six-month
bills was 7.35% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.72%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds

   Earnings reports steered the junk bond market yesterday,
driving many actively traded high-yield bonds higher.
   Most junk bonds, high-yield, high-risk corporate
securities that have low credit ratings or no credit ratings
at all, ended mixed.
   Among junk-bond issues, key advancers included
Owens-Illinois Inc., which gained after the glass-maker
reported strong third-quarter earnings. The company's 12.25%
senior subordinated notes closed 1/2 point higher at 93 3/4
while its 13.45% senior notes ended 1 point higher at 99.
   The cash-paying junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp.
sprinted higher despite the company's reporting a large
pretax loss from continuing operations. Analysts said the
hospital-management company's bonds improved after it assured
bondholders that it will make $39 million in interest
payments due today on two bond issues.
   Market participants had not expected the company to make
the payments. Charter Medical's 14% debentures closed 1/2
point higher at 37 while the 14.25% debentures climbed 2
points to end at 26.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds finished flat to 3/8 point higher.
   In light new-issue activity, the Tennessee Housing
Development Agency's $78.6 million single-family mortgage
revenue bonds were won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group in competitive bidding.
   The bonds were priced at par to yield from 6.20% in 1992
to 7.625% in 2022.
   In secondary dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 finished 3/8 higher at 98 3/4, nudging
the yield down to 7.28% from 7.32% late Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities closed up on the day, but off
their session highs.
   As in the Treasury market, mortgage securities were all
over the board, rising to their session highs early in the
day, then plunging to their lows before rebounding to post
modest gains.
   Among secondary issues, in late trading Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were up 2/32 at
99 16/ 32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were
up 1/32 at 99, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5%
issues were up 1/32 at 99 17/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government-bond market ended firmer yesterday
thanks to a brief short-covering rally. But many analysts
believe that the market will soon resume its downward trend
due to additional supply.
   Investors rushed to buy bonds yesterday after news reports
suggested that tensions in the Mideast could soon be
resolved. That eased inflation fears and caused investors to
purchase bonds in an effort to cover short sale positions. In
a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek
to make a profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities. Essentially, these dealers were betting that
prices would fall.
   The short-covering rapidly ran out of steam as the markets
began to discount some of the earlier news reports.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 7.87%. The price rose 0.68
points to 84.02. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 bond ended at
7.29%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   But traders said the Japanese bond rally may not continue.
They note that the Japanese government will sell between 500
billion yen ($3.36 billion) to 700 billion yen of new 10-year
bonds next week and they worry that the market will sell off
sharply ahead of the big bond sale.
   The coupon rate on the September issue is expected to be
between 7.3% to 7.4%, much higher than the 6.7% rate set for
the August bond.
   Although the higher rate is considered attractive, "it is
too risky for investors to buy Japanese government bonds
right now" said one trader, noting the crisis in the Middle
East and the market's edginess about the Bank of Japan's
monetary policy.
