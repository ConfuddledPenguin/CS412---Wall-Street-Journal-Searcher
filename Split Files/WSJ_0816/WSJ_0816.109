   Sun Microsystems Inc. became the latest company to feel
the heat from International Business Machines Corp.'s
aggressive patent-enforcement policy.
   The maker of high-end workstations signed a
cross-licensing agreement covering IBM's entire patent
portfolio plus all patents filed before July 1, 1995.

   While Sun and IBM never went to court over their patents,
the move marks the end of negotiations that began two years
ago, when IBM wrote Sun a letter suggesting that it "needed a
license to some of their patents," said Michael Morris, vice
president and general counsel of Sun, based in Mountain View,
Calif.
   IBM's vast portfolio of technology encompasses 10,000 U.S.
utility patents, and it grows at a rate of 600 applications a
year. "With a portfolio of such breadth and depth, you run
the risk of inadvertent infringement," Mr. Morris
acknowledged. Sun's portfolio, he added, numbers just 25,
with 106 applications pending.
   IBM has been insistent about requiring that smaller
companies take licenses to its technology. In 1989, IBM
struck a similar cross-licensing pact with Compaq Computer
Corp., requiring the Houston-based maker of PC clones to pay
an estimated $100 million over five years.
   While its terms with Sun weren't disclosed, some analysts
believe Sun paid considerably less. "It's very different,"
said Thomas T. Rooney, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. "Compaq shipped a lot
of product perceived to be infringing," whereas Sun doesn't
engage in the same head-to-head competition. Sun said it will
pay a net royalty payment of a fixed dollar amount to IBM in
five annual installments.
   "Normally, such agreements amount to 1% to 3% of related
revenues," Mr. Rooney said. "It's not going to be significant
to Sun." Sun said in its statement that it doesn't expect
materially adverse impact on its financial performance. In
national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun stock
declined early in the day and closed at $28.25, down 75
cents. IBM stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $105 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   While the companies didn't specify which products or
technologies were at the heart of the deal, some analysts
believe it has to do with IBM's original RISC -- or reduced
instruction set computing -- technology dating from the
1970s. RISC has since been widely adopted throughout the
computer industry.
   Other possible points of contention, according to Mr.
Rooney, are IBM's semiconductor-fabrication technology and
its microchannel-based products, which relate to its PC bus
architecture, which is a sort of data highway into which all
information from chips and other parts flows.
   "It may be that Sun is looking to bring RISC technology to
the desktop in the form of microchannel-compatible products,"
Mr. Rooney speculated. "That would help Sun further penetrate
the low end of the market." Most of Sun's products sell for
$20,000, but it has recently introduced products in the
$5,000-to-$10,000 range.
   An IBM spokesman called the deal "a typical arrangement,"
asserting such cross-licensing pacts "help keep one's assets
in a certain amount of control." The Armonk, N.Y., computer
giant now has an unspecified amount of cash to help defray
its massive research and development budget.
   Some also speculate that IBM, in gaining access to Sun's
patents, might find a use for Sun's proprietary file-server
technology.
   But on balance, Mr. Rooney of Donaldson Lufkin says, "It's
a face-saving device to call this cross-licensing. What does
IBM need from Sun?" Probably not much, apart from its
possible interest in Sun's file-server technology, he added.
"It's a mistake to blow this out of proportion."
   The agreement is expected to remove a potential liability
from Sun's books. Since IBM served notice with its 1988
letter, Sun's annual report has routinely disclosed the
matter as a "contingency," while downplaying its potential
impact on Sun's books.
   Mr. Morris, Sun's general counsel, said the licensing
agreement won't change Sun's primary business focus. "Our
philosophy from the start has always been to pursue an open
systems architecture that can communicate with products of
IBM and others." he said.
   With one important difference, he adds. "This agreement
gives us access to patented technology that we can
incorporate into our products." He didn't elaborate on
potential applications.
   Mr. Morris refused to respond to any speculation about
possible applications of IBM technology. "We didn't focus on
any specific technology in our part of the negotiations," he
said.
   "We don't have any current plan to incorporate IBM
technology into our products," he added, whether it be RISC
or microchannel products. "Legally, we can. But whether or
not we do is subject to further evaluation."
   Sun's fiscal 1990 profit rebounded strongly from a
depressed 1989 performance to $11.2 million, or $1.21 a
share. Revenue grew 40% to $2.47 billion. During the year
ended June 30, Sun logged both record bookings and shipments,
and increased its world-wide installed base of workstations
and file servers to 285,000 units.
