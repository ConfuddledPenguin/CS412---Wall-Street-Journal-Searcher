   NEW YORK -- The stock market eked out a modest gain in
sluggish trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rising less than one point for the second session in a row.
   Buying interest remained confined largely to consumer
stocks -- such as the food, beverage and drug sectors --
whose earnings are expected to hold up well in a weakened
economy.

   The Dow Jones industrials, which bounced around at mostly
higher levels Tuesday before closing with a gain of 0.99,
followed that pattern again in rising 0.50 to 2748.27.
   Stocks rallied broadly at the opening bell as a wave of
optimism about a possible defusing in the Middle East crisis
rippled through the market, reflecting high hopes for today's
scheduled meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and President
Bush.
   King Hussein met with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein before
traveling to Washington and is reportedly carrying a letter
to Bush from the Iraqi president, leading to speculation that
a diplomatic resolution to the conflict might be achieved.
   Similar speculation sparked a surge in share prices in
Tokyo, with the Nikkei Index of 225 issues climbing 5.4%, and
also pushed U.S. Treasury issues higher and crude-oil prices
lower at the outset of trading. Against that backdrop, the
Dow Jones industrials jumped to an early gain of more than 22
points.
   But the advance in stocks "looked like a lot of traders
running in and buying a lot of blue chips early, and it never
really followed through," said Edward J. Laux, head of block
trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Stocks drifted lower through the rest of the morning as
Treasurys and crude-oil futures reversed direction. As was
the case on Tuesday, the market then firmed modestly in the
afternoon and pulled back again near the close.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
gained 0.67 to 340.06, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 0.44 to 186.54 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 0.75 to 315.30.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by 887 to 619. Big
Board volume rose to 135,210,000 shares from 130,320,000
Tuesday. But in the latest session, market activity was "sort
of abysmal" in the afternoon following heavy volume in the
first few hours, Mr. Laux said.
   With the Mideast situation still unsettled, "this is not
an environment where one could be very aggressive" in
expecting the market to rebound from its decline earlier this
month, said Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson advanced 1 1/8 to 68 3/8 following the
release of a preliminary clinical trial on the use of
photopheresis, a process on which the company has patent
protection, in the treatment of an intermediate form of AIDS.
The results, published in a medical journal, showed that four
of five patients that participated in the trial benefited
from the process. Shearson Lehman Brothers reaffirmed a buy
recommendation on the stock in response to the results.
   Other blue-chip consumer issues to draw buyers included
Philip Morris, which went up 1/2 to 47 1/4 in composite
trading of 1.6 million shares; PepsiCo, which climbed 1 3/8
to 78 7/8; Procter &amp; Gamble, which advanced 3/4 to 83 1/2,
and Merck, which added 7/8 to 87 7/8.
   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer rose 2 7/8 to 64 1/8. Smith Barney,
Harris Upham analyst Christina Heuer said she expects the
company's per-share earnings to increase 35% annually from
1990 through 1994, compared with her projected rate for the
drug industry of 15% to 17% a year, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   As oil prices drifted, oil stocks ran into some selling.
Exxon declined 1/4 to 52, Texaco lost 7/8 to 62 3/8, Amoco
slid 1/4 to 56 3/4 and British Petroleum dropped 1/2 to 81
5/8. In the oilfield-services sector, Schlumberger slipped 1
to 65 3/4 and Halliburton lost 7/8 to 56.
   AmBase plummeted 4 3/4 to 2 3/4 on 1.9 million shares
following an agreement to sell its Home Insurance unit for
$544 million to Vik Brothers International, a European-based
group. AmBase, which had promised a special dividend to its
shareholders, said it is now unlikely to make any payout
based on the expected proceeds from the sale.
   Whitman dropped 1 1/2 to 22 1/4 on 1.4 million shares
after deciding against selling its Hussmann Corp. unit. The
company said the net proceeds that it would have received
from the highest bid "weren't sufficient to justify the
sale."
   Limited Inc. lost 3/8 to 19 1/8. Chairman Leslie Wexner is
still working to expand the company as fast as possible even
though many believe the best days for U.S. retailing are
over, The Wall Street Journal reported yeaterday in a page
one story.
   Deere fell 1 3/4 to 64 1/4. Smith Barney lowered its
estimates of the company's fiscal 1990 and 1991 earnings,
citing the impact of a slowing economy on Deere's industrial
equipment operations. Additionally, the Journal reported that
the farm economy is taking a turn for the worse -- a
potential problem for the company's agricultural-equipment
business.
   Alcan Aluminium rose 3/8 to 22 5/8 on trading of one
million shares, while Reynolds Metals rose 1 3/8 to 64 5/8.
Reynolds said it increased its aluminum price earlier in the
week by two cents a share, to 82 cents, following the lead of
Alcan. Separately, Oppenheimer repeated its buy
recommendation on Reynolds.
   Itel, which agreed to repurchase 25% of Henley Group's
18.7 million shares at $18 each within 30 days and another
25% at $19.50 each by year end, added 1 1/4 to 18 1/2. The
company also will repurchase the rest of Henley's shares by
next June at $21 or $22 apiece, depending on the purchase's
timing, or underwrite their sale at $22 each. Henley slipped
1/2 to 25 1/4 in over-the-counter trading.
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel went up 3/8 to 7 3/8. The
company reached a tentative accord with the United
Steelworkers of America on a new labor contract, heading off
a threatened strike and clearing the last major hurdle in
gaining approval for a reorganization plan.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.70
to 340.64. Volume totaled 13,640,000 issues.
