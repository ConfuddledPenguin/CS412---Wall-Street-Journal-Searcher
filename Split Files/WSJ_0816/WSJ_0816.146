   CHICAGO -- William Farley's investment empire continued to
shrink with a sale of $43 million of Fruit of the Loom Inc.'s
common.
   The sale to Land Free Investment Ltd., based in the
Channel Islands, apparently reduces the voting stake in the
underwear manufacturer controlled by Mr. Farley to little
more than 50% from nearly 60% two years ago, according to
people close to Mr. Farley's closely held interests.

   Farley officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment
yesterday.
   Mr. Farley was pressured to make yesterday's sale by some
of his bankers, sources said. They said profit will be used
largely to pay overdue bank debt. A $37.9 million payment to
certain bondholders that was due yesterday probably won't be
made for now, they said.
   Meanwhile, negotiations continued among Mr. Farley, the
bondholders and bankers over control of West Point-Pepperell
Inc., according to sources close to that situation. Mr.
Farley hasn't been able to complete last year's $1.56 billion
tender offer for West Point-Pepperell, a textile concern
based in West Point, Ga.
   Mr. Farley's financial strength, which was based on junk
bonds, ebbed after the collapse of his investment banker,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Farley Inc., the selling entity in yesterday's stock
transaction, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that profit from the sale will "significantly reduce
the likelihood" of the "adverse consequences of an
unfavorable restructuring of Farley Inc."
   Yesterday's sale involved 3,750,000 Class B shares of
Fruit of the Loom at $11.50 a share. Farley's SEC filing said
it sold 335,000 Fruit of the Loom Class A shares on the open
market between June 19 and July 26 for $12 to $13.25 a share.
   Fruit of the Loom closed yesterday at $12.625 a share, up
$1.125, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
