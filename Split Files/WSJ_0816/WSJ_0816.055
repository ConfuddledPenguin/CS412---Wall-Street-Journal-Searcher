   In many investors' minds, buying an annuity is like
getting married to the mob: Even if you're miserable with the
arrangement, you can't get out until you die.
   It isn't surprising investors feel this way. Annuities are
tax-deferred retirement accounts, much like individual
retirement accounts. Like IRAs, there are penalties for
taking the money out early. The insurance companies that
underwrite annuities usually impose stiff surrender
penaltiestypically 7% in the first year, declining by one
percentage point a year over seven years or so. The federal
government imposes a 10% penalty, plus taxes, on money
withdrawn before age 59 1/2.

   But this doesn't always mean that investors have to be
locked into an annuity they don't like. While the surrender
penalties may encourage investors to stay put for several
years, investors can avoid federal penalties by transferring
their money into another annuity.
   "You can move annuities the same way you move an IRA,"
says Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York. The
procedure is simple. Investors merely fill out a "1035
exchange" form (named for the applicable section of the Tax
Code on which it's based), and give it to the insurer they
want to deal with in the future. The new company will arrange
the transfer.
   Since the money never leaves the insurers' hands, it isn't
subject to federal penalties. "I'm surprised more people
don't do this," says Mr. Daily.
   One reason annuity investors might want to switch is poor
performance. That's apt to be a particular concern of
investors in "fixed-rate annuities," which usually pay a rate
that's close to that of a certificate of deposit.
   To entice new investors, many insurers offer a high
initial rate, which is guaranteed only for the first year or
so. Thereafter, the rate investors get is reset annually-at
the discretion of the insurer. "They promise you a rate for
one year, then you're at their mercy," says James Hunt, a
director of the National Insurance Consumers Organization in
Alexandria, Va.
   Investors who find that their renewal rates have fallen
greatly may choose to switch to an issuer with higher rates
and a good record of keeping the renewal rates high.
   Another reason investors transfer their annuities is to
get a higher level of guaranteed death benefit. Most
annuities guarantee that if the annuity holder dies, the
heirs receive either the principal sum invested, or the
market value, whichever is higher. Most annuity investors are
quite happy knowing that their heirs would receive the higher
amount.
   But there are circumstances that could reduce the value of
an annuity between now and the time the annuity holder dies
-- especially if the annuity held is a "variable annuity."
Much like mutual funds, variable annuities allow investors to
allocate their money among a variety of funds, including
stock, bond and money-market funds. Returns vary with the
performance of these underlying funds. So does the value of
the annuity.
   Investors who want to lock in the current value of their
annuities can do so by switching to another company. That
way, the current value becomes the new floor, says Geoff
Bobroff, an annuity specialist with Lipper Analytical
Services Inc.
   A third reason investors might consider transferring an
annuity is uneasiness over the financial soundness of the
issuer. Take Gerald D. Jacobs, a retired Pacific Bell manager
living in Corona, Calif. Eight years ago, he bought a
fixed-annuity issued by Executive Life Insurance Co. of Los
Angeles.
   Now, after reading news accounts of the financial problems
facing Executive Life's parent, First Executive Corp. of Los
Angeles, Mr. Jacobs says he wants to switch. First Executive
has insisted that policyholders have no cause for concern.
Still, many people like Mr. Jacobs have already pulled out.
This week, First Executive disclosed in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that investors redeemed $2.24
billion in annuities in the first six months of 1990.
   Before moving their money, however, investors must
identify appropriate alternative annuities. "You don't want
to make the same mistakes you made last time," says Mr.
Daily, author of the Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load
Insurance Products.
   Mr. Jacobs is doing just that. To address his concerns
about financial soundness, he's looking for an issuer with a
high credit rating from A.M. Best Co. and from Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp.
   Once investors initiate a transfer, the process may take
several weeks, during which time investors forgo interest
payments.
