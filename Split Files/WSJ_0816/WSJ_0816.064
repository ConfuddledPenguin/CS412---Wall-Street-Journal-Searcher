   MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. -- Investors Savings Corp. said Thomas
Fritz resigned as chairman, president and chief executive
officer of the thrift holding company because of "differences
in management style."
   James M. Burkholder, chief operating officer and chief
financial officer, and John G. Lohmann Jr., secretary of the
company and chief lending officer, will assume portions of
Mr. Fritz's responsibilities until the board finds a
successor, Investors Savings said.

   In an interview, Mr. Burkholder characterized Mr. Fritz's
departure as "friendly" and the result of a "mutual decision"
reached with the board.
   Mr. Fritz, a co-founder of the $575 million asset thrift,
"is fully supportive of our management team and . . . as a
major shareholder, his confidence in our future remains
undiminished," Investors Savings said in a letter to
employees made public yesterday. Mr. Fritz couldn't be
reached for comment.
