   Yachtsman Dennis Conner has carried home the America's Cup
four times since 1974. One would think sponsors would line up
to back him when he defends the cup again in 1992 in San
Diego.
   One would be wrong. Yesterday, Mr. Conner announced that
PepsiCo has signed on as a major sponsor for the 1992 yacht
race, joining General Motors' Cadillac as the first of what
Mr. Conner hopes will be 10 major corporate sponsors. But
these days, when ad budgets are tight and seem only to be
shrinking, wooing sponsors isn't as easy as it might seem.

   Mr. Conner has called on 50 companies since he began his
dog-and-pony show for advertisers three months ago. He
traveled to Detroit to make the Cadillac deal, and called on
Pepsi to plead his case. After the Pepsi agreement was
finalized, he says, he wrote the first draft of the news
release and called reporters himself yesterday morning.
   "It's tough. I'm out there competing with the golf and
tennis tournaments," he says of his surprisingly hands-on
involvement. "We have to go out and sell it every time. Every
{race}, we start from scratch."
   Mr. Conner says corporate interest is strong in the race,
and he seems certain he can raise $27 million from major
sponsors before eliminations begin in early 1992. But the
fact that Mr. Conner, as a multiple-winner of the America's
Cup and something of a household name, still must pound the
pavement himself to raise money shows just how tough the $2.5
billion sports sponsorship business has become.
   Major advertisers right now are being bombarded with
sponsorship opportunities, and not just the run-of-the-mill
football contests, either. In 1992, when the America's Cup
race is to be held in San Diego, advertisers will also have
the chance to sponsor other international events, including
the Olympic games, the World's Fair in Spain and the 500th
anniversary of Columbus discovering America.
   "You've got to pick and choose because you have so many"
big events, says Buhl Ford, sales promotion coordinator for
Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division. "In this kind of
environment, you've got to pick what's going to do the best
for the company."
   Lincoln-Mercury sponsored Mr. Conner's sloop, Stars &amp;
Stripes, in the 1987 America's Cup race in Australia, but
decided against it this time around, Mr. Ford says. "It was
very expensive to sponsor those boats, and it didn't make a
lot of sense to a lot of people," he says. "Twelve-meter boat
racing {appeals to} a very specialized market of people with
very special interests, and that is probably very small
compared to all the people we want to sell cars to."
   The high cost of the America's Cup sponsorships is enough
to make some other advertisers think twice, too. Industry
executives say Mr. Conner is seeking a $3 million commitment
from major sponsors. "For one-sixth or one-seventh of that,
you could sponsor an Olympic team and spend the difference
promoting your affiliation, so you really have a hard sell
with the America's Cup," says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special
Events Report, a Chicago newsletter that tracks sponsorships.
"That isn't to say that for certain companies it isn't a good
opportunity, but it really faces a lot of hard-core
competition."
   All sports events in search of sponsors are facing the
same frustrations. Mr. Conner, though, also is working to
overcome a lingering image problem. After the 1987 win, he
became a hero for winning back the cup he had lost to
Australia in 1983. But his public image soured a bit after he
succumbed to what might be called the Mary Lou Retton
syndrome, taking on so many endorsements that he seemed
almost ubiquitous. He shilled for American Express and Pepsi,
for Izod LaCoste, Royal Viking cruise lines, and Ray Ban,
among others. "A lot of people looked at what he was doing as
selling out to the highest bidder, so he was losing some of
his attractiveness to sponsors," Ms. Ukman contends.
   His image wasn't helped after he was challenged for the
cup by a New Zealand crew in 1988. He handily beat the
challengers, but the losers tried to overturn his victory in
court because of his unorthodox use of a catamaran rather
than a single-hull boat. That dispute, after going through
three courts, was finally resolved in his favor just a few
months ago, but not before it got very nasty. At a news
conference just after winning the challenge, for instance,
the two sides almost came to blows.
   But Pepsi, for one, says it isn't concerned about past
difficulties. "Unquestionably, there were issues over the
legal problems that muddied the water a little bit, but those
issues have been resolved," a spokesman says.
   The America's Cup is also more attractive this time around
because it will be held in the U.S. and because sponsors can
now put their logos on the boats they sponsor, a recent
development. "Three years ago there was no opportunity for
signage on the boat. Now, all of a sudden, it's a billboard,"
says Mr. Conner, who couldn't be happier with that turn of
events. With five cameras aboard each boat, he says, viewers
won't be able to help but see logos on sails, visors, shirts
or wristbands.
   International yachting rules were loosened up to allow
sponsors to plaster their logos everywhere because the cost
of yacht racing has risen so wildly in recent years. In 1980,
Mr. Conner says, his budget for the entire race was $2.5
million, and funding came largely from private investors. But
since then, boat construction has changed from inexpensive
aluminum to costly carbon-fiber composites, boosting Mr.
Conner's expected costs to almost $30 million. Many of the 21
challengers from 16 countries will be floating
advertisements, too.
   "I can't write a check for $30 million," Mr. Conner says
of his efforts to woo sponsors. "The only way to compete is
to have corporate America on my side. Without their help and
support, I wouldn't be able to mount a serious effort."
