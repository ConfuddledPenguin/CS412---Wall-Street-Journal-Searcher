   TORONTO -- Imperial Oil Ltd. agreed to sell the refining
and marketing assets it acquired in Canada's Atlantic Coast
provinces and other downstream assets in three separate
transactions that analysts valued at about 300 million
Canadian dollars (US$262.3 million).
   Most of the assets to be sold were acquired as part of
Imperial's C$5 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc.,
completed earlier this year.

   Montreal-based Ultramar Canada Inc. agreed to buy the bulk
of the assets in the Atlantic Coast provinces, including 199
service stations, three marine terminals and a refinery. The
deal must still be approved by Canadian antitrust regulators.
   Imperial Oil, 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., pledged to shed
all of Texaco Canada's downstream oil and gas assets in
Canada's Atlantic provinces as part of its commitments to the
Canadian government's antitrust agency, the Bureau of
Competition Policy. Those commitments were required before
regulators would approve the Texaco Canada acquisition.
   Imperial wouldn't disclose the price Ultramar agreed to
pay for the assets, but analysts valued the transaction at
about C$200 million.
   Imperial also said it agreed to sell 25 retail gas
stations and its other assets in Newfoundland to a private
consortium, Island Petroleum Co. An additional 96
company-owned service stations outside Canada's Atlantic
provinces will be sold to 35 individual bidders, pending
government approval, Imperial said. The company didn't
disclose the value of those two transactions, which analysts
said could fetch C$100 million.
   Profits from these asset sales will help Imperial cut its
debt load, which soared to C$5.8 billion after the Texaco
Canada acquisition. Asset sales, a C$1.3 billion equity issue
and cash from operations helped reduce the company's debt to
C$3.5 billion by June 30, 1990.
   Still on the block are about 300 service stations
throughout the rest of Canada and between C$500 million and
C$750 million of oil and gas producing assets in Western
Canada. These are slated to be sold over the next 18 months.
   Dennis Baxter, a spokesman for Imperial declined to
speculate what the remaining downstream assets might fetch,
but he said the company has received 529 bids for the
remaining service stations.
   Mr. Baxter added that Imperial is also getting offers on
its upstream production properties, but acknowledged that
"that's a very difficult market at the moment."
   Analysts said the acquisition would be a positive move for
the Montreal-based unit of Britain's Ultramar PLC.
   "Until now, they've had a minimal exposure in that
market," said Philippe Hervieu, an analyst with Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc. in Montreal. "This is a breakthrough for
them."
   Ultramar's acquisition more than doubles the company's
retail outlets in three of the four Atlantic provinces to 337
from 138. An Ultramar executive said the company didn't bid
for the Texaco stations in the fourth Atlantic province,
Newfoundland, because Ultramar already has 221 outlets there.
   The company emerged early as a logical buyer for the
assets because antitrust regulators probably wouldn't have
approved offers by other major integrated oil companies.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Imperial Oil closed at C$64, unchanged.
