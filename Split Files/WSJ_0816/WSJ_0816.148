   Separately, S&amp;P said it downgraded the ratings on
Continental Illinois Overseas Finance Corp. N.V.'s
subordinated debt to Triple-B-minus from Triple-B.
   Also, Continental Bank N.A.'s senior notes, long-term
certificates of deposit, and letter of credit backed issues
were lowered to Triple-B-plus from Single-A-minus, and its
short-term certificates of deposit and letter of credit
backed issues are affirmed at Single A-2, the rating agency
said.
   S&amp;P said about $1 billion in term debt outstanding is
affected.
   S&amp;P said: "Continental is almost entirely focused on
wholesale banking lines of business, whose core profitability
has eroded as a result of a lower volume of transactions,
particularly for leveraged buyout financings. The company has
initiated a restructuring program to help rein in overhead
expenses that had gotten out of line in a slower business
environment.
   "Even assuming full implementation of the restructuring
program," S&amp;P said it "expects core profitability will remain
under pressure given the intense competition and industry
overcapacity in wholesale banking."
   S&amp;P also said it is "concerned about Continental's large
exposure to highly leveraged transactions and the recent
deterioration in that portfolio's asset quality."
   "Partly offsetting these concerns are an adequate level of
capital and full reserves for the remaining exposure to
lesser developed countries," S&amp;P said.
