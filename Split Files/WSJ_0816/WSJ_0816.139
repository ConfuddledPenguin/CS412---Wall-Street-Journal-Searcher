   NEW YORK -- One of the tenets of the 1980s was that
raiding companies was a great way to make really big money.
But it's beginning to look as though Carl Icahn could have
done just about as well with a staid, buy-and-hold strategy.
   Mr. Icahn, a Brooklyn-born, Princeton-educated raider who
is 54 years old, ranks among the decade's most prominent
raiders and is still considered one of the "smart money"
types that investors like to follow.

   Now chairman of struggling Trans World Airlines, Mr. Icahn
made his name and much of his estimated $1 billion fortune by
buying big stakes in companies such as Texaco and USX, then
rattling his sword at their managers until they took steps to
push up the stock price.
   But a review of Mr. Icahn's big, public investments
suggests that he could have made as much money -- and saved
himself the hassle and expense of proxy fights, takeover bids
and confrontations -- if he had picked a few good stocks and
passively held onto them.
   Of course, it wouldn't have been as much fun. Mr. Icahn
says: "I have to buy {stocks} where I can be an activist.
It's not my nature to be like {Warren} Buffett," a
quadribillionaire from Omaha, Neb., who is famous for making
big, passive investments.
   For nearly four years, Mr. Icahn has been trapped in a
huge stake in USX, an oil and steel giant, that cost him $817
million. The investment has produced returns of less than 15%
a year, including dividends. Meanwhile, the shares of another
big oil company, Atlantic Richfield, have more than doubled.
   The investment that truly enriched Mr. Icahn -- and
elevated him to billionaire status -- was Texaco, an 18-month
holding that he sold in mid-1989 for a $650 million profit on
a $1.4 billion investment, or roughly 37% a year. But Mr.
Icahn could have done almost as well over the same time
period if he had quietly bought stock in Chevron or one of
many popular growth stocks.
   Mr. Icahn's returns from USX and Texaco, based on his
average holding time and including the dividends he received,
were calculated by Wealth Monitors, a Kansas City firm that
tracks America's richest stock players.
   Mr. Icahn "has proven he's a smart investor," says Michael
Short, an analyst at Wealth Monitors. But he adds that it
doesn't always pay to follow Mr. Icahn when he puts money
into something. "He's earned far more notoriety than his
investments might merit," Mr. Short says.
   Then there is Mr. Icahn's 90% stake in TWA, which was
suffering even before the Mideast crisis sent fuel costs
soaring. At first glance, Mr. Icahn seems to have done well
in TWA. In 1988, he piled debt onto the company to take it
private, taking out $469 million of cash -- a little more
than his initial cost to buy a 77% stake in TWA. And after
the buy-out, he owned 90% of the airline. So Mr. Icahn
essentially bought a big international carrier for nothing.
   On the other hand, it took Mr. Icahn three years to get
back his money in TWA. In that time, he forfeited more than
$100 million in interest he could have earned on the cash he
had invested in the airline. So, unless he can sell the
carrier, or unless it miraculously turns around, his
long-running involvement with TWA could turn out to be
unprofitable.
   To be sure, Mr. Icahn buys shares on margin, using
borrowed funds, as well as his own money. This raises his
risks but also his returns on the cash he actually invests.
On that basis, his annualized profit on Texaco was more like
70%, though he could have made a similar leveraged investment
in Chevron. And he might still make something of his USX
stake; that story isn't over.
   Mr. Icahn bought Texaco, he says, because he hoped he
could help settle its bankruptcy-law case and get the stock
price up. But he adds: "I've always said that buying and
selling stocks is not that great. The real money is made by
buying whole companies." He says his best investment ever was
ACF Industries, a rail car company and a vehicle for his
raids.
   In the mid-1980s, Mr. Icahn bought ACF for $20 million.
This year, he expects the rail car operation to throw off
more than $100 million in cash flow; in addition, ACF has
more than $1 billion in cash and securities.
   It is understood that Mr. Icahn recently got a tentative
bid for ACF's rail car operations from Samuel Zell, the
Chicago real estate and rail car tycoon who is chairman of
Itel Corp. Mr. Zell couldn't be reached to comment, but
apparently he initially valued ACF's rail cars alone at about
$800 million, then lowered his bid after looking at the tax
implications.
   Interestingly, Mr. Icahn hasn't used his Texaco profit to
make another splash in the stock market. When he cashed out
of Texaco in June 1988, speculators were betting he would
soon make a multibillion-dollar acquisition, perhaps of USX
or even Time Warner. Instead, he is making a foray into junk
bonds. The jury is still out on that particular venture.
   Recently, there have been rumors that Mr. Icahn, through
ACF, has been buying TWA's riskiest junk bonds, which will
soon start paying interest in cash and which have been
trading at about 30 cents on the dollar. Mr. Icahn won't
confirm this, and some analysts believe the bonds are
practically worthless.
   Since 1988, Mr. Icahn has spent huge amounts of time and
effort on TWA, which is embroiled in labor disputes. The
carrier has been a useful vehicle for his stock plays, but he
says he personally hasn't made a dime from the airline
itself.
   In the past, Mr. Icahn apparently hoped to sell TWA for as
much as $1 billion. But now some analysts believe his equity
interest in the airline isn't worth much.
   Indeed, many people wonder whether TWA can survive. It has
about $3 billion of long-term obligations, and next year its
cash deficit, after paying all debt charges and capital
spending, might be $800 million, according to a recent report
by an analyst at R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a New York firm that
specializes in distressed securities such as TWA's junk
bonds.
   The analyst's report suggests that TWA, even if it keeps
selling assets, might run out of cash in a year or so.
   Last week, TWA reported that second-quarter profit on
operations -- before interest and other charges -- fell by
almost half to $43.9 million from $80.5 million a year
earlier. After paying interest and other charges, TWA had net
income of $103.4 million, boosted by a $160 million gain on
asset sales.
   Mr. Icahn says, "The airline business is hard to operate
today." But he says TWA today has more than $1 billion in
cash and securities, which he could use either "to pursue
investment opportunities" or buy planes inexpensively, as
other airlines go bust. "Even some of my critics now agree I
did the right thing by not buying shiny new planes in the
last few years," he says. "There are already a lot of
bargains in planes on the market."
   Some people close to TWA believe its cash-flow deficit
next year shouldn't be more than $300 million, a gap it can
bridge by using its cash or selling more assets.
   TWA's $1 billion of cash and securities could dwindle, of
course, if the stock market tumbles. TWA's USX stake now is
valued at about $180 million, and it has other stocks. In
addition, TWA has cash in the bank of $650 million, thanks to
some recent asset sales.
   TWA pilots believe that if the carrier is to survive, it
needs big changes in the way it is run, and in its finances.
They recently floated a proposal for a debt-equity swap that
asked Mr. Icahn to relinquish some of his ownership stake in
TWA to creditors, in a bid to cut interest and lease costs by
about $300 million annually. In exchange, the pilots said
they would offer $150 million of wage concessions. Mr. Icahn
doesn't think much of the proposal.
   The investor sometimes makes money by investing passively.
In recent years, he says, "I bought Telephone {American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph} at the right time and I bought IBM at
the right time."
   But Mr. Icahn says he believes in activism: "What
individual is brave enough to stake $700 million on one
company, unless he's willing to make things happen, such as
settling a bankruptcy?"
