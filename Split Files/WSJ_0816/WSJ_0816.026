   OTTAWA -- A U.S.-Canada panel upheld a U.S. decision to
impose countervailing duties on imported steel rails from
Canada because the imports threatened to injure U.S. steel
manufacturers.
   The panel, set up under provisions of the U.S.-Canada
free-trade agreement, ruled that the U.S. steel industry was
being injured by imports of subsidized and dumped steel rails
produced by Algoma Steel Corp., a unit of Dofasco Inc.,
Burlington, Ontario, and Sydney Steel Corp., a Nova Scotia
government agency.

   The U.S. Commerce Department ruled last year that some of
the steel rail imports from Canada were dumped, or sold in
the U.S. at prices below the cost of production or the prices
in the home market. The department also found that they were
being subsidized by the Canadian government.
   The department said Algoma and other Canadian producers
had sold steel rails to U.S. railroads, subway systems and
other buyers at prices averaging 38.79% below the "fair
value" price. Another U.S.-Canada panel will review that
38.79% dumping margin in a ruling expected Aug. 30.
   James Melville, a vice president of Algoma Steel, said the
extra duties will be a "significant nuisance" to Algoma but
that they weren't a "fatal blow" to Algoma's steel rail
production. Mr. Melville estimated that Algoma's steel rail
exports to the U.S. total an average $10 million Canadian
dollars (US$8.7 million) a year, which, he said, made up very
little of Algoma's overall sales.
   The panel decision also upheld an order last year by the
U.S. International Trade Commission that extra duties be
placed on imported steel rails from Sydney Steel to offset
the Canadian government subsidies.
   The Commerce Department ruled that Algoma should be
excluded from countervailing duties placed on subsidized rail
imports because its estimated subsidies amounted to only
about 0.24% of the price of its rail exports.
   The U.S. government investigation originated from
complaints filed by Bethlehem, Pa.-based Bethlehem Steel
Corp. on behalf of the U.S. industry.
