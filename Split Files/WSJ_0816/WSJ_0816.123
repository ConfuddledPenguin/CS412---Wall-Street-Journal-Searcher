   MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. -- In a bid to capture a bigger share
of the post-bubble gum set, Warner-Lambert Co. said it is
testing a new sugarless gum that won't stick to dentures.
   The health care and consumer products company said the new
brand, called Cristal, will be available in southern Texas
and Louisiana by mid-September. Cristal was launched in
Canada last year.

   With such brands as Trident sugarless gum, Bubblicious
bubble gum and Chiclets sugar-coated gum, Warner-Lambert
already controls about 30% of the $1.8 billion U.S. market
for chewing gum. But that market is slow-growing and
extremely competitive.
   With Cristal, the company is taking aim at consumers 35
years old and over, who have crowns, caps or bridges. The
company estimates that some 30 million Americans wear
dentures, and that at least 80 million have had serious
dental work.
   "Historically, gum chewing declines with age," said Maria
Gagnier, category director for gum at Warner-Lambert. "But as
Baby Boomers age, gum chewing has become more acceptable --
just like Rock &amp; Roll music."
   Warner-Lambert is also hoping Cristal will stick it to top
gum rival Wrigley Co., which lords over the U.S. market with
an estimated 50% share. Wrigley virtually created the U.S.
market for non-stick gums with its Freedent brand, launched
in 1975. The company is now testing a sugarless version of
Freedent, according to a Wrigley spokesman.
