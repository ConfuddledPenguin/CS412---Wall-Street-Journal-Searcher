   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. signed a tentative
two-year agreement with the Communications Workers of
America, replacing a three-year pact covering 2,500 workers
that expired more than a week ago.
   Under the new accord, which must be approved by union
members, workers will get a 3.5% wage increase in each of the
next two years and will retain current health benefits.

   Western Union, which has been fighting to avoid filing for
bankruptcy because of a crushing debt problem, had been
pushing for workers to pay a bigger share of its annual
health tab. Another proposal would have eliminated
profit-sharing.
   "Workers at this company had already taken a 10% pay cut
and agreed to less vacation time," said a CWA spokesman.
"Still, the company wanted the profit-sharing plan eliminated
despite the fact that it hasn't paid a dime in years."
   The new pact keeps the profit-sharing plan in place and,
said the spokesman, "is in line with other union settlements
in the communications industry over the last two years."
   However, Western Union did get an agreement that
eliminates restrictions on hiring of outside contract
workers. And the pact allows greater use of part-time workers
at the company's central telephone bureaus where customer
orders are processed. That, said a spokesman, is important
since the company experiences "surges" at certain periods of
the day when it needs extra workers to process orders.
   "We think this is an agreement that's fair to all
concerned," he said.
   The negotiations had grown contentious in the last couple
of days after the company locked out the 2,500 unionized
workers over the weekend and replaced them with nonunion
workers. The CWA filed a complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board, charging Western Union with unfair labor
practices. The company has since rescinded the lockout and
the workers have returned to their jobs.
   Meanwhile, Western Union adjourned its annual meeting for
the fourth time since June as it struggled to win approval of
its recapitalization plan from shareholders. Western Union
plans to reconvene the meeting today at noon EDT at the
Ramada Inn in Montvale, N.J.
   The company has said it will have to seek Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, while it works out a plan to pay its
debt, if it can't win approval of the recapitalization plan.
That plan calls for a reclassification of Western Union's
preferred stock to common shares and the exchange of new debt
securities and common stock for the company's present senior
notes covering some $530 million of a total $640 million in
debt.
   Last month, a representative for the company's bondholders
said that most would be willing to go along with the exchange
offer. That offer, which expired at midnight yesterday has
been extended until midnight Monday, Aug. 20.
   However, the company must first get stockholder approval
of the reclassification. Western Union's spokesman said the
company is close to getting the two-thirds majority vote
necessary to approve the reclassification.
