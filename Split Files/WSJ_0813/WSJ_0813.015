   TORONTO -- Robert Campeau was removed as chairman and
chief executive of Campeau Corp., the company he founded 40
years ago. The chief executive's role was temporarily given
to representatives of the debt-burdened company's major
creditors.
   Campeau, a real-estate and retailing concern based in
Toronto, didn't give a reason for the change in control, and
company directors wouldn't comment. A company official said,
however, that there would be no change in the concern's plans
to dispose of most of its Canadian real-estate assets in
order to restructure its ailing finances.

   The move also doesn't affect the status of the company's
U.S. retailing subsidiaries, Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp., which sought protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last
January.
   "At this stage there's no plan to do anything differently.
Everything that was proceeding before will still now
proceed," said Lionel Dodd, a Campeau director and chief
operating officer of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., a
major Campeau creditor and its biggest shareholder.
   In a brief statement, Campeau said Friday that its board
appointed James D. Raymond and Gary M. Goodman as joint chief
executive officers on an interim basis. Mr. Raymond was named
to the board last week to represent National Bank of Canada,
another big Campeau creditor and shareholder. Mr. Goodman,
also a Campeau director, is an executive at O&amp;Y, which is
closely held by Toronto's Reichmann family.
   Campeau also said it appointed longtime director Robert
Despres as interim chairman, and said it has begun searching
for a permanent chairman and chief executive.
   Mr. Campeau, who remains a director of Campeau Corp., has
been forced gradually to cede control of his company since
his ambitious $10 billion takeovers of Federated and Allied
went sour. Last September, Mr. Campeau surrendered majority
control in exchange for an emergency loan to the U.S.
retailers by O&amp;Y. And in January, Mr. Campeau's holding was
further reduced -- to 21% from 43% on a fully diluted basis
-- after Montreal-based National Bank seized a number of his
securities. The bank took the action after Mr. Campeau
defaulted on personal loans.
   Campeau Corp.'s creditors also have increased their
presence on the board since last year. Of a total of 11
Campeau directors, O&amp;Y and National Bank currently hold a
combined six seats.
   But progress to turn the company around has been slow at
best. Mr. Campeau acknowledged at the July 30 shareholders
meeting that six months of negotiations had failed to obtain
standstill agreements with its major creditors, O&amp;Y and
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., a Youngstown, Ohio, developer.
Campeau Corp. defaulted on the loans, totaling $705 million,
in January. In March, the company refused to pay interest due
on the loans. A demand for repayment could drive the concern
into bankruptcy.
   Heavy financing costs, as well as write-downs related to
Federated and Allied, contributed to a net loss of $1.74
billion in the year ended Jan. 31.
   The decision to dismiss Mr. Campeau came after "lengthy"
discussions by the board over the past two weeks, a source
said.
   "I suspect {Mr. Campeau} will provide a lot of advice.
{But} his principal role will be that of a director," Mr.
Dodd said.
   Meanwhile, the company will continue to seek buyers for
its real-estate assets, which carry a book value of about $1
billion. Included are such prominent properties as the
68-story Scotia Plaza in downtown Toronto and the Place de
Ville office tower in Ottawa. Still, company officials aren't
counting on any quick fixes.
   "The real-estate market has been very slow generally," Mr.
Dodd said.
