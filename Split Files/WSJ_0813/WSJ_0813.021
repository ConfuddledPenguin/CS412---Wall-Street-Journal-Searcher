   As the U.S. sends troops to Saudi Arabia, American forces
for the first time since World War I will face an enemy that
has used poison gases. Here are some of the typical questions
that have arisen about such a danger.

   Q. What chemical weapons does Iraq have?
   A. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and
others who follow the proliferation of chemical weapons, the
Iraqis have thousands of tons of mustard gas and hundreds of
tons of nerve gas at their disposal. The Iraqi buildup of
chemical agents began in 1981, shortly after the Israelis
bombed Osirak, a large French-built nuclear research reactor
outside of Baghdad. By knocking out what they feared was a
plant dedicated to making nuclear weapons, the Israelis
helped provoke Saddam Hussein's interest in what some people
call "The Poor Man's Bomb" -- poison gas.
                                                                                                       

   Q. What effect do chemical weapons have on the
battlefield?
   A. The biggest effect may be psychological. Mustard gas
caused most of the 1.3 million gas casualties in World War I,
of which 7% were fatal. It blisters the skin and burns the
lungs. Nerve gas, developed but never used by the Germans in
World War II, attacks the body's central nervous system, and
can cause death -- either through inhalation or through
contact with the skin -- within a few minutes. The mere
threat of the use of such weapons forces an opposing force to
don rubberized protective clothing and masks that can degrade
the fighting power of military units between 30% and 80%,
according to a 1985 Pentagon study.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Are there any defenses?
   A. Yes. The U.S. Marines being deployed to the desert, for
example, have been issued new British hand-held electronic
detectors that can instantly detect the presence of chemical
agents. They have also been issued protective overgarments
that are lighter than previous designs and somewhat
breathable, giving them some relief from the searing desert
temperatures. New gas masks have been designed to allow
soldiers to talk and drink, eliminating some of the
shortcomings in earlier defensive gear, which tended to make
soldiers feel helpless and alone. U.S. troops are also issued
spring-loaded syringes containing atropine and another
chemical that blocks the effect of nerve gas. Unfortunately,
according to the 1985 Pentagon study, the injection may
"leave the victim (temporarily) dehydrated, incoherent and
mentally disoriented."
                                                                                                       

   Q. How are chemical weapons used in the battlefield?
   A. In their war against Iran, Iraqis loaded gas into
bombs, rocket warheads, artillery and mortar shells. The
warhead's explosion turns liquid chemicals into a fine
aerosol that descends on troops and their equipment. Often
odorless and tasteless, chemical weapons are also believed to
be a major threat to warships: They can cause havoc and many
casualties if they are sucked into a ship's ventilation
system. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard University biochemist,
says the intense heat of the Saudi desert may minimize the
effects of nerve gas through rapid evaporation. Some forms of
nerve gas, however, contain a thickening agent to amke them
persist.
                                                                                                       

   Q. What would the U.S. do to retaliate against a chemical
weapons attack?
   A. Although U.S. officials haven't ruled out the use of
chemical or nuclear weapons in such an event, they have said
privately that the most likely counterattack would be to use
precision-guided conventional weapons, such as bombs or
rockets, on the most sensitive Iraqi targets. "We can do a
hell of a lot more damage to the guy who's causing all the
trouble {Saddam Hussein} with our conventional arsenal," says
one official, who asked not to be identified.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How did the Iraqis get their large arsenal of chemical
weapons?
   A. With a lot of help from businessmen in the West.
Investigators here and in Europe have identified a string of
U.S., Japaneses, Dutch and West German companies that have
contributed chemicals, equipment and expertise to the Iraq
effort. Foreign technicians, primarily West German
mercenaries, are believed to have helped build Iraq's two
chemical weapons plants, located in Samarra and Fallujah,
along with a research center at Salman Pak, 25 miles
southeast of Baghdad. Shipments of equipment and chemicals
from the West were imported through the Turkish port of
Mersin, according to U.S. officials.
