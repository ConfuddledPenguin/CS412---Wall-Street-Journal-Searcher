   OTTAWA -- Canadian housing starts declined 11% in July to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 173,000 units from a
June level of 195,000 units, Canadian Mortgage and Housing
Corp., a government agency, said.
   The corporation said the July decline provided further
evidence that weakness in house-building activity is becoming
more widespread across the country.

reported that Canada's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
rose to 7.8% in July from 7.5% in June.
