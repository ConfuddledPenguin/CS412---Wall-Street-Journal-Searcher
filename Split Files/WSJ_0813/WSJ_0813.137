   NEW YORK -- Mutual fund investors just weathered one of
the stormiest weeks since the Crash of '87.
   But while all fund categories dropped, most stock-fund
groups outperformed the market as a whole in the week ended
Thursday.

   As might be expected, some fund groups that are supposed
to cushion the ride for investors were among the least
affected as the markets went into spasms following news of
the Middle East crisis. Equity-income funds and
growth-and-income funds both declined less than the 3.13%
drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. According to
figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., the
equity-income group was down 2.48%, while the
growth-and-income category lost 2.73%.
   Perhaps surprisingly, some other fund groups that
typically follow the performance of the overall market
managed to do a bit better this time. Capital-appreciation
funds declined 2.97%, while growth funds were off 3.03%, the
Lipper numbers show.
   One-week performance numbers shouldn't be the basis of
anyone's investment decisions, of course. But the results of
the latest period show once again how portfolios with
income-oriented investments, such as high-dividend stocks,
can lessen the shocks of unruly markets.
   The Lipper numbers also show the importance of looking
beyond group results. Many individual funds did strikingly
better or worse than their group averages. Among
equity-income funds, for instance, Bull &amp; Bear Equity Income
lost 3.88%, underperforming the group average by 1.4
percentage points. Some capital-appreciation funds actually
posted gains. These included Shield Portfolio: Aggressive
Growth, up 2.84%; Sherman Dean Fund, up 2.40%, and Dreyfus
Capital Value, up 2.25%.
   The week's biggest losers were international funds. The
general international stock fund category was off 5.68%, but
funds that specialize in stocks of companies in the Pacific
region were off an even bigger 7.03%. According to Lipper's
compilation, the worst-performing fund of any group was
Tyndall-Newport: Tiger. The fund, which invests mostly in
Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, dropped 12.80%.
   Even among international funds, however, there were
exceptions to the overall group performance. Some Australian
funds posted gains for the week, while some Canadian funds
lost very little: First Australia Income was up 2.31%,
MacKenzie Canada was down 1.41%. Among the reasons, says A.
Michael Lipper, president of the analytical firm, is that
higher oil prices could benefit oil-producing countries
outside the Middle East, including Australia and Canada.
   Other poor performers included small-company growth funds,
down 3.67%, and science-and-technology funds, down 3.8%.
Historically, these categories are among the weakest
performers in market drops, according to Lipper.
   Gold funds were the strongest performing stock-fund
category, losing 1.29%. Indeed, the best performing fund of
the 1,784 stock and bond funds that Lipper tracks was
Strategic Gold &amp; Minerals, up 5.26%.
   On the whole, funds that include both bonds and stocks
lost less than straight stock funds. That's because the bonds
in their portfolios generate yields that offset the falling
values of the stocks.
   These groups include convertible securities funds, which
contain corporate bonds or preferred stocks that can be
converted into a specified number of a company's shares, and
balanced funds, which typically have at least 40% of their
portfolios invested in bonds.
   "Flexible-portfolio" funds also held up well. These are
asset-allocation funds that are structured to include stocks,
bonds, gold, other securities and cash, in percentages that
reflect the fund manager's perception of what will perform
best under current economic conditions.
