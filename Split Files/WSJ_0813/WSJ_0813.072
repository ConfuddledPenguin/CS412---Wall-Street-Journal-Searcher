   TOKYO -- Nippondenso Co. said it and Italy's Magneti
Marelli S.p.A. agreed to establish a joint venture to produce
car air conditioners in Britain and to exchange shares in two
subsidiaries.
   The two companies will form the joint venture to pursue
market opportunities in the quickly developing European
market, the Japanese company said.

   Nippondenso is the second-largest member of the Toyota
group and is 23.3%-owned by Toyota Motor Corp. Milan-based
Magneti Marelli is 60%-owned by Fiat S.p.A.
   Nippondenso will hold 75% of the joint venture, and
Magneti Marelli the remainder.
   The new firm is to be located in Shropshire and
capitalized at an initial investment of around #65 million
($121.4 million). The two parents aim for it to turn out
400,000 units each of automotive air conditioners and heaters
by 1995, Nippondenso said.
   Under the agreement, Nippondenso also will acquire 25% of
Magneti Marelli's Borletti Climatizzazione S.r.l. unit, which
makes air conditioners and heaters in Italy, while Magneti
Marelli will take 25% in Nippondenso's ND Marston Ltd., a
maker of radiators in the U.K.
