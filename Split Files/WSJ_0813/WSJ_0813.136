   NEW YORK -- The indicator most likely to kick-start a
recession -- consumer spending -- occupies economists' minds,
if not their calendars, this week.
   Instead, the days ahead are heavy with July economic
reports, most of which are passe in light of the recent
Middle East oil crisis. Thursday carries the heaviest data
with reports on the consumer price index, industrial
production, capacity utilization, housing starts and building
permits. The week also brings July retail sales due tomorrow
and the June trade deficit, due Friday.

   The industrial reports are likely to be flat, confirming
beliefs that the economy had already stalled before the oil
crisis. As for inflation, the consensus view calls for the
July CPI to log a moderate 0.3% increase, on the heels of a
slight fall in the July producer price index.
   "But no one will care," says Brian J. Fabbri, chief
economist at Midland Montagu Bank, New York. "The obvious
focus is on what the CPI and PPI will do in the next two
months: They're both probably going to be up over one
percentage point," he adds.
   Now, economists are trying to figure how that higher
inflation will bite into consumer spending, which accounts
for about two-thirds of all economic activity.
   Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist,
calculates that every $6.25 increase in the price of a barrel
of oil adds a full percentage point to the CPI. So, the
approximately $26-a-barrel price will add nearly 1 1/2
percentage points to the CPI.
   Traditionally, about half of the increase comes out of
personal savings as consumers spend on energy needs what they
would have banked, he said. "But the other half comes out of
discretionary spending," he added. So, Mr. Ratajczak figures
the initial trickle-down impact on consumer spending will be
a drop of about three-quarters of one percentage point.
August statistics should begin to record the drop.
   Will that be enough of a spending shock to drop the
economy into recession? "That question rests on where you
thought we were going when the oil crisis happened. I think
we were headed toward recession anyway," said Mr. Ratajczak.
He just lowered an already-sluggish growth rate forecast on
real gross national product to 0.5 percentage point from one
percentage point for the next four quarters.
   Not everyone thinks the oil crisis will force a recession.
Stephen H. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
New York, just issued a post-crisis economic outlook that
noted: "We continue to maintain that the U.S. economy has
enough forward momentum to avoid contraction -- even in the
face of an energy shock."
   Midland Montagu's Mr. Fabbri noted that the oil crisis
could tarnish a longstanding bright spot: exports. Since
Eastern Europe and Asia will be paying more for their oil,
too, their appetite for U.S.-made goods may tumble, he said.
   A drop-off in global demand would work against the U.S.
trade deficit, as would higher prices for imported oil. On
the other hand, lower imports to the U.S. because of cooler
consumer spending could help the trade balance. Mr. Fabbri
noted such offsetting forces may mean that the overall trade
deficit doesn't move very much. "So, people might
underestimate the effect of oil," he said. "But there will no
doubt be a shift of resources to the oil-producing countries
and probably weaken the U.S."
   The consensus on the June trade deficit calls for a slight
narrowing to $7.1 billion from $7.7 billion in May, according
to MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. MMS noted
the oil imports were lower and prices were softer in June.
Since trade figures lag by two months, the oil crisis isn't
expected to be reflected in the deficit report for some time.
   Other views call for a meager 0.1% increase in July
industrial production after June's 0.4% gain. The operating
capacity is likewise expected to rachet down to 83.4% from
83.5% in June. July retail sales are expected to log a weak
0.3% increase on the heels of June's 0.5% gain.
