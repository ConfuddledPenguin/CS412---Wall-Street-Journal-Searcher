   WASHINGTON -- United Parcel Service of America Inc. and
the Teamsters union have agreed to keep negotiating on a new
labor contract even if members reject the company's latest
offer, the package-delivery service said.
   Results of the vote by the 140,000 members who work for
UPS are expected today.

   A UPS spokesman said both sides acceded to a request by
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to continue
bargaining over a new three-year contract.
   No union spokesman who would discuss the issue could be
reached. Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a dissident group
based in Detroit, said one local had received two messages
from the union's headquarters, the first denying any
agreement to keep negotiating, but the second acknowledging
that the union would continue the talks.
   A spokesman for the mediation service said the agency does
intend to ask the union and the UPS to keep bargaining, and
he said the agency is "optimistic" that they will agree to do
so.
   The current contract expired Aug. 1. The Teamsters agreed
to keep working and to extend the deadline for counting the
ballots until last Friday. Any majority vote against
ratifying the offer would empower the Teamsters leaders to
call a strike. Both the union's leadership and the dissident
group have recommended that the rank-and-file reject the UPS
offer.
   TDU officials say this isn't a good time a strike. The
impact on UPS business would be diminished, because August is
a slow month for small-parcel deliveries. The union would do
better to wait until the busy October-December delivery
season approaches, they say.
   But union leaders and members may also be concerned that
UPS, the nation's largest small-package delivery firm, might
lose market share from a strike. The Postal Service is
gearing up to absorb some of the UPS business if there's a
strike, and some other firms have developed new distribution
schemes to make up for loss of UPS service.
   The TDU, in fact, has urged negotiators to return to the
bargaining table. It suggested that members aren't "eager to
strike" and said that "UPS Teamsters are proud of the
top-notch service UPS provides."
   The UPS has called its offer "final," the same term it
used for an earlier offer that union negotiators spurned. The
latest offer includes a wage increase of 50 cents an hour, or
about 3%; a cost-of-living raise capped at 20 cents an hour,
in the second and third years of the contract; signing
bonuses; a lower-wage tier for new employees, and an increase
of 35 cents an hour in the employer contribution to the
health and welfare fund and the pension fund.
