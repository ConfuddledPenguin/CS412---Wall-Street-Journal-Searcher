   NEW YORK -- Thirty supertankers, each carrying one million
to 2.5 million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil, will
arrive in the U.S. over the next week, suggesting that Iraq
and Kuwait had sold substantially more crude than previously
estimated to the U.S. before an embargo was imposed Aug. 2.
   The oil was loaded and shipped before the embargo, and
therefore can't be turned away from their destinations at
ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, U.S. Customs
officials in the region said Friday that many more ships are
expected to follow close behind throughout the month.

   The number of ships suggests that Iraq and Kuwait had sold
substantially more crude oil for delivery to the U.S. in
August and September than the approximately 800,000 barrels a
day of imports that the U.S. Energy Department estimates the
two Persian Gulf producers averaged from January to May 1989.
   Assuming the ships are of a median size of 1.75 million
barrels and averaging the volumes over 30 days, imports of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude would total together about 1.75
million barrels a day over that period.
   It isn't clear, however, whether buyers were expecting
such elevated volumes to continue or whether those countries
simply made substantial sales in advance of the last
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting, when
the group agreed to cut its output to a new ceiling of 22.5
million barrels a day.
