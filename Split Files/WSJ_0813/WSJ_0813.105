   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. predicted the company would
prevail in a proxy battle with former chairman William F.
Farah.
   The company made its prediction after a surprisingly
anticlimactic special shareholder meeting Friday, called by
Mr. Farah to consider his demand that seven of the company's
nine board members be ousted. A company counterproposal
sought the removal of Mr. Farah and longtime associate
Charles C. Wood as directors.

   While preliminary results won't be disclosed until later
this week, the company said it has enough votes to defeat Mr.
Farah. A spokesman for Shareholders Communications Inc., Mr.
Farah's New York proxy solicitation firm, insisted the vote
was too close to call.
   Officials also indicated the company expects to report a
third-quarter loss; results are expected to be disclosed in
two weeks. In the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net
loss of $2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9
million. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Farah fell to $2.875, down 62.5 cents.
   If the company prevails, it would mark the end of Mr.
Farah's 53-year career at the apparel manufacturing company
founded by his parents. Throughout his tumultuous, 25-year
reign as chief executive officer, Mr. Farah had outlasted
several potential successors, including his oldest son James,
and survived one previous ouster backed by the company's
creditors.
