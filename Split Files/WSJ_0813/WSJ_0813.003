   There's nothing Mickey Mouse about collecting celluloid
frames of Walt Disney's famous rodent.
   Animation art, once prized only by a small circle of
cartoon memorabilia buffs and perhaps parents looking to
spruce up the kids' room, is now big time. At the heart of
the collection craze are 9-by-12-inch "cels" -- individually
hand-painted celluloid frames -- tens of thousands of which
go into each cartoon.

   Experts caution that investing in cels requires
sophistication. Despite the growing popularity of the
often-colorful pieces that galleries, auction houses and
well-heeled collectors now consider fine art, prices for some
high-end cels have dropped recently, for example, as more
large private collections have gone on the market. And then
there are questions of whether both the art and its value
might, quite literally, chip away with time.
   Mike Glad, though, continues to add to his 1,000-piece
collection. "It's like buying a piece of art. A piece of
history. A piece of childhood," says the 43-year-old Fremont,
Calif., auto-store owner, who savors the "magical feeling
when you freeze that same frame on your TV set and say, `I've
got it right here.'"
   Though there are followings for the likes of Bugs Bunny,
Woody Woodpecker, Fred Flintstone and the latter-day Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles -- their studio sells cels of Leonardo
and friends for $60 to $80 each -- Disney characters capture
the greatest interest.
   Especially Mickey. New York restaurateur Peter Merolo, 37
years old, says acquiring a cel is like "buying a heartbeat
of Mickey Mouse." He claims to have sold a black-and-white
cel from the 1934 Disney short "Orphan's Benefit" in a
private transaction a year ago for $450,000. That was a year
after buying it for $50,000, he says.
   Cels surviving from early Disney cartoons and movies such
as "Pinocchio" and "Snow White" similarly attract serious
money in auction houses. Top auction prices ranged from
$20,000 in 1984 to $286,000 in 1989, the current record. Cels
capturing memorable moments often are most prized. One from
the 1955 film "Lady and the Tramp," showing the title
characters falling in love over a plate of spaghetti,
recently sold for $104,500.
   Even less-coveted Disney originals, such as those in
pedestrian poses or lacking a background, often sell for
$1,000 or more. In fact, dealers and collectors say, the
biggest growth in interest recently is for those cels, Disney
or otherwise, under $5,000. Appreciation last year of 40% or
more wasn't unusual for these, says Howard Lowery, a Burbank,
Calif., dealer.
   It is big money for pieces of plastic once tossed out or
sold for a pittance. After completing production, many film
companies dumped or destroyed cels or erased them for reuse.
Those featuring the Warner Bros. panoply of Bugs Bunny, Daffy
Duck, Porky Pig and others are especially scarce. After
closing its cartoon studio in 1962, Warner burned several
hundred thousand to make space for its publicity department.
Disney old-timers tell of parties at which folks slid around
the floor on them once a cartoon was in the can.
   "I'm flattered that people want to buy something we
thought was trash," says Woody Woodpecker's 90-year-old
creator, Walter Lantz. A Disney artist in the 1930s, he later
ran his own Hollywood production company until "sort of
retiring" in 1988. Mr. Lantz says he "must have buried
hundreds of thousands of {the cels} because no storage
company wanted them."
   Created to last "about two weeks -- long enough to get
from the ink and paint department to the camera department,"
many older cels are in poor condition, says Ron Stark, whose
S/R Industries in Agoura, Calif., specializes in restoring
and preserving them. But some collectors and consultants say
restoration lowers the value, thus posing a danger for
investment-minded buyers.
   "Animation cels are not blue-chip; you could buy them and
they may disintegrate on you in a couple of years, especially
the ones made before 1940" of nitrate material, says Disney
archivist David R. Smith. Others disagree. "If preserved
properly, they could last for 1,000 years," says Mr. Merolo.
   Disney, which as early as the 1940s marketed cels through
a San Francisco art gallery, saw cels as collectibles earlier
than most other studios. But it hardly anticipated the
current market. For decades Disneyland sold cels for $1.25
each. And, indeed, there have been some windfalls for folks
checking attics or garages.
   In the late 1970s, Chicago-based Circle Fine Art Corp.
began carrying cels at its nationwide group of galleries.
(Two of its galleries today carry animation art exclusively.)
But it wasn't until a December 1984 Christie's auction of
several hundred cels from the personal collection of John
Basmajian, a retired Disney employee, that cels caught fire
with collectors. In the bidding, a Mickey cel sold for a
then-record-breaking $20,900.
   "I thought the Basmajian collection would depress the
market," says S/R Industries' Mr. Stark, who evaluated about
1,000 cels for the Basmajian family. "Instead, it catapulted
animation art into a whole new period." Buyers included movie
directors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Soon, attention
to the trendy collectibles was prompting baby boomers raised
on the Jetsons and Rocky and Bullwinkle to seek
less-expensive cels.
   The surprising auction prices also encouraged other former
studio employees to put their private collections on the
market. That has flattened and even lowered values of some
top-tier items that turned out to be less rare than buyers
had thought. At a June animated-art auction, Sotheby's
biggest-ticket item -- a 1933 Mickey from "The Mail Pilot" --
sold for $115,500, below the expectations of some observers,
though still $45,500 above the top range of Sotheby's
estimate.
   Still, many dealers and collectors believe the rarest
pre-1960 animation pieces are likely to trickle into
availability now, exciting instead of depressing the market.
Sure, there could be more surprises for big investors, says
Mr. Spielberg's buyer, Russ Cochran. "If somebody ever opens
a bank vault and finds 100 cels from "Steamboat Willie"
{Mickey's first cartoon}, these investors that paid six
figures are going to eat it. But these investors are betting
against it, and I'm betting with them."
   Cels now offer a new line of profit for Disney and other
studios after production ends on a cartoon. In June 1989,
Disney organized a special auction of 394 cels from "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit," taking in about $1.4 million. Another
auction, of cels from "The Little Mermaid," is set for Dec.
15 at Sotheby's in New York.
   The popularity of cheaper cels also has spawned a new
"limited edition" industry -- offering newly hand-painted,
sometimes artist-signed celluloids that re-create cartoon
scenes in numbered groups of perhaps 100 to 1,000.
   While shunned by many serious collectors, limited editions
give some aging original animators long-delayed recognition
-- and cozy retirement incomes. Chuck Jones and Fritz
Freleng, two original Bugs Bunny artists who say they don't
receive any residuals from Warner and, in fact, pay Warner a
royalty on limited-edition sales, are churning out signed
cels for galleries around the nation. These, and
limited-edition cels from the Disney organization, start at
$200 or less, and in some unusual cases have appreciated 25%
or more annually, says Michael Halbreich, co-owner of Cricket
Gallery, Wyckoff, N.J.
   Critics such as animation author Jerry Beck say limited
editions lack archival value, and thus "will never be worth
as much as a genuine production cel." He says a production
cel "is a piece of a movie, but a limited-edition cel is
nothing but a piece of plastic with paint on it."
   Still, says the 83-year-old Mr. Freleng, who also is
drawing new cels featuring his Pink Panther creation, "My
name has become more important because there are not many of
us left."
   And Betty Boop limited editions have helped Grim Natwick
cash in at last. "I never thought I would get Betty back
after all these years," says Mr. Natwick, who drew the
curly-haired character for Fleischer Studios in the 1930s,
and who plans to still be drawing cels for gallery sale when
he turns 100 on Thursday.
