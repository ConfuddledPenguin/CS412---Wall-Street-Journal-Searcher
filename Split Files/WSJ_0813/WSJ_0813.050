   The best energy-investment bet right now may not be oil,
but natural gas.
   And limited partnerships may be one of the best ways to
play it -- at least for sophisticated investors who
understand and can tolerate the risks involved.

   Whatever happens in the Middle East, "the case for natural
gas in this country is exponentially stronger than it is for
oil over the next 10 years," says John Olson, an energy
analyst at First Boston Corp. in Houston.
   Cheap and plentiful in the U.S., natural gas at $1.30 per
thousand cubic feet is an alternative fuel bargain that was
enjoying growing industrial demand even before Iraqi troops
stormed into Kuwait. The crisis is expected to boost demand
further, as utilities and other big energy users scramble to
cut their dependence on imported oil.
   The argument for limited partnerships is that they are
direct investments that allow income to flow to the investors
without being taxed at the company level, as is the case with
ordinary corporations. Some natural gas partnerships also
pass through attractive tax benefits. And because
partnerships are outside the stock market, they are less
susceptible to day-to-day swings in investor sentiment than
are the shares of gas producers or mutual funds that buy
them.
   But there are also risks.
   Partnerships as a way of investing in nearly anything have
had their image tarnished because of their high fees and
generally poor past performance. At least 20% of the nearly
$90 billion of partnerships marketed publicly during the
syndication boom of the 1980s are now troubled. While most of
those problems are in real estate partnerships, thousands of
oil and gas investors were stung badly in energy partnerships
syndicated after the last oil crisis in the late 1970s.
   Partnerships are also long-term investments. People
thinking about investing in them should be willing to commit
their money for seven to 10 years, when the partnership is
dissolved and the proceeds are distributed to the limited
partners.
   Most "energy partnerships" are primarily natural-gas
investments, since gas reserves are both more abundant and
easier to develop than new oil supplies. There are two basic
kinds of energy partnerships.
   So-called "income partnerships" buy only proven reserves,
not speculative properties. These generally target
distributions to investors of as much as 18% or 20% a year.
Because the reserves backing those distributions are
continually being depleted, however, part of that money is a
return of investors' own capital. For the same reason,
distributions are highest in the early years of these
partnerships.
   "You'd be getting into income funds because you're
speculating that oil and gas prices will go up," says William
G. Brennan, a tax partner in the Washington office of
accountants Ernst &amp; Young. In addition, investors get to take
a deduction on their income taxes for their portion of the
partnership's "cost-depletion allowance," he notes. "I've
seen partnerships where 60% to 70% of the cash flow in the
first year was tax-free because of depletion," Mr. Brennan
says.
   The other basic type of energy partnership is the
"drilling partnership." These are mostly "development"
partnerships, which are involved in drilling wells in or near
proven fields. In addition to the depletion allowance,
investors who are willing to assume the special risk of
becoming "general partners" typically get to write off about
80% of their investment against any other income the first
year.
   "The chief advantage is the tax deduction," says Fuhrman
Nettles, a vice president at Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a
Shrewsbury, N.J., partnership publishing and consulting firm.
"In addition, however, if they happen to run into an elephant
{big discovery} by mistake you make a lot of money."
   The downside is that investors who want to take that big
write-off have to assume unlimited liability for their
partnership's operating expenses and uninsured losses. But
Mr. Nettles says most new drilling partnerships aren't as
leveraged as they used to be, and they have beefed up their
liability insurance.
   Some drilling partnerships also give investors the option
of skipping the big deduction and investing as limited
partners. Sponsors may also permit investors to go in as a
general partner for just the first year -- so they can claim
the 80% write-off -- then convert their "working interest" to
a limited-partner interest.
   Some drilling-fund sponsors, though not all, have also
lowered their front-end fees drastically. Brokerage
commissions still range from 8% to 10% of a typical $5,000
minimum investment.
   But Canfield, Ohio-based Everflow Eastern Inc., which
currently has a $20 million offering, will keep only 0.4% of
that to cover its own costs of marketing the partnership. On
the other hand, Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum Co., a Midland,
Texas, sponsor that is selling a $100 million drilling
partnership, will claim 15% in front-end fees.
   Sales of drilling partnerships were rising even before the
Iraqi invasion. Through July, $14.6 million had gone into the
funds, compared with just $2.2 million during the same period
last year.
   Now, "they're slowly climbing at the rate of about $3
million a month," says Mr. Nettles. Sales of income funds,
which have steadily declined in recent years, were $157.2
million through July, down 57% from $351.2 million a year
ago.
   While gas prices are still under some pressure because of
a surplus in certain regions of the country, that "bubble"
could rapidly disappear with the winter home-heating season
just around the corner. State utility regulators, realizing
they can't count on imported oil supplies, "are going to want
to make sure that local gas companies are up to the brim with
inventories," says First Boston's Mr. Olson. Most aren't now,
either because they have some gas left over from last year's
unusually warm winter or because they have been waiting for
prices to fall even lower.
   But Mr. Nettles adds a final note of caution. In the
current heated environment, dealing with reputable energy
partnership sponsors is more important than ever. Even before
Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, he says, the
increasing world-wide demand for oil had brought out
promoters pushing questionable deals.
