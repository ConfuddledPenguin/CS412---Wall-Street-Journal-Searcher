   WASHINGTON -- Despite promises this year of political
reforms, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko continues to rule
his central African country by violently suppressing
opposition voices, the New York-based Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights charged.
   The committee, in a 231-page report, concluded that Mr.
Mobutu's security forces have maintained control and quashed
"any perceived threat to the president's authority" through a
policy of political killings, torture, arbitrary arrests and
harassment. The report said that security forces have
violently suppressed student protests, killing at least 12
students at the University of Lubumbashi in southeastern
Zaire last May.

   "Since President Mobutu took power in a military coup in
1965, thousands of Zaireans have been killed, or subjected to
torture, cruel treatment, or prolonged arbitrary detentions,"
the report charged. It said that Zaire's repressive policy
has "lead to a total breakdown in the rule of law in Zaire."
   The Zairean Embassy in Washington declined to comment. Mr.
Mobutu, reportedly one of the world's richest men, is an
important U.S. ally and a recipient of substantial U.S. aid.
   The lawyers' report comes as President Mobutu finds
himself under increasing attack, both inside and outside
Zaire, because of his alleged plundering of his country's
wealth and serious human-rights abuses. On Capitol Hill, the
House voted to prohibit direct aid to Zaire; Belgium,
meanwhile, froze all assistance to its former colony to
protest the alleged Lubumbashi massacre. In addition, the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, concerned by
Mr. Mobutu's persistent misspending, aren't providing new
loans to Zaire.
   The lawyers' committee, formed in 1978, monitors
human-rights conditions world-wide, according to Makau wa
Mutua, who heads the committee's Africa Project and
co-authored the Zaire report, titled "Zaire: Repression as
Policy." The report was based on extensive research, Mr.
Makau said, including interviews with eyewitnesses,
government officials and opposition activists in Zaire.
   Mr. Makau and his co-author, Peter Rosenblum, were
attacked on the street in Kinshasa, the capital, during their
second visit last March. The government, in an investigation
of the incident, denied involvement, but acknowledged that
some of the laywers' movements were monitored by security
forces.
   The report charged that the long history of human-rights
abuses has been carried out by Zaire's four principal
security forces. It said that the security forces "occupy a
privileged position" and "have unrestrained authority to
arrest, abuse and detain the population in detention centers;
these actions are effectively unreviewable by Zaire's
civilian judiciary."
   The government, the report said, routinely arrests and
detains its critics incommunicado "from several days to
several months" without placing charges against them.
Moreover, the report said, "Zaire's armed and security forces
have been involved in extrajudicial executions of students,
peasants and opposition activists during 1989 and 1990."
   It noted that last April President Mobutu announced with
much fanfare that he was lifting a longtime ban on opposition
parties and preparing other political reforms. But within a
week, the report said, security forces, in an apparently
unprovoked attack, disrupted an opposition political rally in
Kinshasa and killed at least three people.
   The report also noted that the U.S. continues to provide
vital economic and military support to Zaire, despite massive
corruption and human-rights violations. It said that the U.S.
shouldn't provide more funds to Zaire unless the government
shows "demonstrable progress" on human rights.
