   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp., the wounded
insurance holding company, said its longtime auditor,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, has declined to continue in that capacity.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company said it hasn't had any disagreements with
Deloitte &amp; Touche in the past 2 1/2 years, and the reason for
the firm's decision to remove itself remains unclear.

   First Executive, the parent of Executive Life Insurance
Co., a California concern, and Executive Life Insurance Co.
of New York, has been the subject of widespread news coverage
since earlier this year, when it reported an $859 million
write-down of its junk-bond portfolio. The unexpected
write-down, which applied as of Dec. 31, 1989, brought the
company's net loss for last year to $775.6 million, or $9.67
a share.
   First Executive noted in its filing that, in June, it
hired William L. Sanders as chief financial officer,
treasurer and a corporate vice president. Mr. Sanders had
been the Deloitte &amp; Touche partner in charge of First
Executive's audit since 1986.
   Subsequent to hiring Mr. Sanders, First Executive said, it
recruited a number of other Deloitte &amp; Touche employees who
also had worked on its audit. First Executive said it
employed the former members of the group that audited it "in
order to expand its accounting staff."
   The company said that, because of the resulting changes at
Deloitte &amp; Touche, it had begun considering a possible change
of accountants but hadn't reached any decision when Deloitte
&amp; Touche apparently beat it to the punch and resigned.
However, the filing doesn't explicitly connect Deloitte &amp;
Touche's decision to resign with First Executive's unusual
decision to employ what appears to have been a substantial
portion of its outside auditor's team.
   First Executive's disclosure was made in an 8-K
extraordinary events filing with the SEC. The filing, dated
July 30, was signed by a corporate officer Aug. 2 and
received by the commission the next day.
   For its part, Deloitte &amp; Touche, in an attached
one-sentence letter, said it concurred with First Executive's
"comments" in the 8-K filing but didn't provide further
disclosure. Robert Garland, managing partner of Deloitte &amp;
Touche's Los Angeles office, declined to elaborate.
   Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive officer of First
Executive, said the company hasn't selected a successor to
Deloitte &amp; Touche. Before a merger that created Deloitte &amp;
Touche, a predecessor firm, Touche Ross &amp; Co., had audited
First Executive. "They are an excellent firm, and we have
enjoyed an excellent relationship with them," Mr. Carr said,
adding that he had discussed Deloitte &amp; Touche's decision to
withdraw as auditor at First Executive's July 30 annual
meeting.
   Mr. Carr said he wasn't sure how many members of Deloitte
&amp; Touche's former audit team had been recruited by First
Executive. "I'm guessing that it's seven or eight," he said.
   Deloitte &amp; Touche is a defendant with First Executive in
shareholder suits focusing, among other things, on alleged
inadequate disclosure of the company's troubled financial
condition.
   Over the years, the accounting firm has issued a series of
unqualified audit opinions on First Executive. However, in
its March 29, 1990 report on the 1989 financial statements,
Deloitte &amp; Touche included extensive cautionary explanations.
Among other things, it said that the estimated market value
of First Executive's $8 billion-plus junk-bond holdings was
based on the company's and certain brokers' subjective
determinations because the market for some of the securities
was either too volatile or too illiquid to get a clear
reading.
   However, the auditor's letter didn't flag or explain the
$859 million write-down or note that, even after the
write-down, the company's market value of the bond portfolio
remained about $1 billion below the $13.26 billion value at
which it is recorded on First Executive's books. Deloitte &amp;
Touche did note, however, that if troubled market conditions
continue, the company could suffer greater portfolio losses
than then estimated.
   First Executive is the subject of a number of regulatory
inquiries, among them a formal SEC investigation begun in
March that is looking into the company's financial
statements, including the bond-portfolio write-down.
   As its financial woes deepened this year, including more
than $1.33 billion paid in the first quarter to holders
cashing in policies, First Executive began pointing to
studies by consulting actuaries Milliman &amp; Robertson, which
it said proved that its California-based Executive Life
Insurance unit was financially sound and able to withstand a
variety of hypothetical adversities.
   But, while reporting the good news, First Executive thus
far has refused to make the reports themselves public.
   Friday, New York's state appeals court delayed ruling on
an appeal by First Executive to forestall disclosure of the
reports to Joseph Belth, publisher of "Insurance Forum," and
a frequent critic of First Executive. A lower court had
ordered the New York State Department of Insurance, which has
copies of the reports, to make them public under state
freedom of information statutes.
