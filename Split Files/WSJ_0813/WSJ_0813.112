   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said a Massachusetts
state court judge temporarily blocked the previously
announced merger of the company's main Boston-based affiliate
with its affiliate bank in Western Massachusetts.
   As reported, the troubled bank holding company had planned
to merge its Springfield, Mass.-based Bank of New
England-West affiliate with its Bank of New England, N.A.,
Boston, as part of its program to streamline operations and
cut costs.

   A Bank of New England spokesman said the state court
granted a motion to block the merger that had been made by a
group of 16 investors in the bank. They were shareholders of
a small Massachusetts bank that previously merged with
another bank, which, in turn, was acquired in 1986 by Bank of
New England Corp.
   The shareholders are seeking additional payment for their
holdings in the original bank. They assert that Bank of New
England's currently planned merger could hurt their chances
of receiving the payments, which a state judge earlier
ordered Bank of New England to make to them. The bank has
appealed that order.
   The Bank of New England spokesman said, "We believe {the
state court's action} is a temporary obstacle and expect to
resolve all legal issues and proceed promptly with the
merger."
