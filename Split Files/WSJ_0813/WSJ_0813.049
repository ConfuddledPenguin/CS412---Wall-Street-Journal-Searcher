   WASHINGTON -- While the Army and Navy so far are relying
almost exclusively on active-duty personnel to respond to the
crisis in the Middle East, about 5,000 Air Force reservists
have an indispensable role in shipping troops and weapons to
the region.
   The effort is the largest U.S. airlift since the Vietnam
War era, and the Military Airlift Command is using nearly its
entire fleet of more than 300 long-range cargo planes.
Reservists are providing crews for about 60% of all supply
flights, according to Pentagon officials.

   As the use of the full fleet suggests, there is a shortage
of cargo planes and ship capacity that is hampering efforts
to shore up U.S. firepower quickly in the fast-changing
crisis in Saudi Arabia. It will take two or three more weeks
to put in place what Pentagon officials describe as the
"minimum deterrent force" of more than 40,000 fully equipped
ground troops, and keeping them properly supplied will strain
U.S. resources.
   The Defense Department also is looking to charter planes
from U.S. airlines, and as many as eight fast, specially
built transport ships with civilian crews also are being
readied by the Navy to carry armored divisions to the Middle
East.
   Most commercial carriers are likely to have few planes to
spare at the height of the summer tourist season, however,
and the Pentagon has stopped short of formally invoking a law
under which airlines would have to provide planes to form a
so-called Civil Reserve Air Fleet.
   The Airlift Command's reserve officers, many of whom are
commercial pilots and routinely fly military cargo planes
once a month, are now volunteering for longer and more
frequent missions during periods when they aren't working.
Reservists also are helping to provide maintenance for giant
C-5A and C-141 cargo planes, which take 17 hours or longer to
fly from the U.S. to the Middle East.
   Many of the reservists now strapped into cockpits of cargo
planes also helped transport troops during the U.S. invasion
of Panama last year.
   So far, none of the pilots have had to give up their
civilian jobs, as they haven't been called to active duty.
   "It's really difficult to say how long we can sustain this
level of effort," said Lt. Col. Robert Duignan, deputy
commander for operations for a wing of C-141s manned by
reservists and based at Andrews Air Force Base in
Washington's Maryland suburbs. "We've got an outstanding
response" from reserve officers, he said in an interview over
the weekend, and "everyone in the unit will have the
opportunity to get involved."
   A much smaller contingent of National Guard troops from as
many as 20 states has been placed on active duty, military
officials said over the weekend, including units that provide
aerial refueling, medical support and other non-combat
assistance. At this point, fewer than 1,500 reservists are
believed to be in this category, but Pentagon spokesmen have
declined to confirm most details of troop movements.
   Overall, Army and Navy brass believe they can sustain the
first phase of Operation "Desert Shield" -- calling for
movement of the equivalent of two battle-ready divisions,
some 300 aircraft and about 40 U.S. ships -- without calling
up significant additional reserves. Army officials, for
instance, said that so far they haven't been forced to adjust
nationwide recruitment goals, alter preliminary plans to
withdraw some 50,000 troops from Europe next year or
otherwise change deployment plans involving the rest of the
world.
   But if the U.S. commitment jumps to 100,000 or 150,000
combat troops in the next few months, as some Pentagon
officials predict may be necessary to counter Iraqi
aggression, Pentagon officials said they almost certainly
will have to rely more heavily on reserves and alter their
long-range plans.
   The shortage in capacity highlights disagreements between
Congress and the Pentagon over the future role and shape of
America's 1.1 million-strong reserve forces -- and how deeply
they should be cut in the wake of improved U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Just a few weeks ago, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was
urging Congress to approve a cut of nearly 15% in reserve
personnel by the mid-1990s, as part of the effort to bring
military spending in line with deficit-reduction targets.
Both the Senate and the House Armed Services Committee
refused to lock in such hefty cuts.
   Now that the Middle East turmoil has erupted, legislative
efforts to beef up reserve forces -- in terms of equipment as
well as personnel -- are likely to gain support when
lawmakers return from their August recess.
   Appearing on NBC's "Meet The Press" yesterday, Mr. Cheney
emphasized the long-term problem of inserting and then
supplying a large force in the Middle East. "I wouldn't want
to put an upper limit" on the U.S. commitment, he said. But
"no one should assume {it will} be easy, or is going to be
wrapped up very quickly . . . without a significant U.S.
effort."
