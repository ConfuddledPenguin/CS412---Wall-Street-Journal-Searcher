   TOKYO -- Showa Denko K.K. said Friday that a total of 89
suits have been filed against it in the U.S. for damages
allegedly caused by an amino acid it manufactures.
   Damages requested in the suits total $810 million, a Showa
official confirmed.

   Lots of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan manufactured
by Showa have been linked to outbreaks of a blood disorder
that can cause high fever, weakness, shortness of breath and
even death.
   Showa will pursue further studies of the effects of the
amino acid before deciding whether it will meet the suits in
court or try to settle them privately, the official said.
   "There has been a statistical connection in the U.S. It
hasn't been proven to be a direct cause in animal tests,
however," the official said.
   Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare have suspended sales
of L-tryptophan. Until sales were stopped, Showa exported
around 70 tons of L-tryptophan a year to the U.S.
   A report published this week in the New England Journal of
Medicine said that the outbreak of the disease probably
stemmed from a change in Showa's manufacturing process.
Researchers said they found that the problems began after
Showa started using a new strain of microbe in manufacturing
and halved the amount of carbon it used to filter impurities.
