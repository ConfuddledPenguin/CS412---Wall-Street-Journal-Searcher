   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. signaled that it will
raise prices broadly on most of its 1991 cars and trucks, and
continue to use discount deals as the remedy should consumers
balk.
   A GM spokesman described the preliminary price increases
for models officially introduced this fall as "moderate." But
he didn't provide details on how much base prices of specific
1991 models will rise over prices of models introduced a year
ago. The spokesman said GM plans to reduce the prices on
certain packages of optional equipment, reviving a
discounting strategy GM largely abandoned last fall.

   GM's preliminary 1991 pricing strategy appears to follow
the pattern of the past two years. With few exceptions, GM is
raising the base prices of carryover models, partly to
reflect new standard equipment, and partly to offset the cost
of handing some of the price increase back to consumers in
the form of discounts.
   Ford Motor Co. has taken an approach similar to this in
its preliminary 1991 pricing. Chrysler Corp.'s strategy is
somewhat more complex. The No. 3 auto maker is cutting base
prices of certain 1991 car and truck models in an effort to
avoid further discounting or fight off stiffer competition.
To compensate, Chrysler is boosting prices aggressively on
some of its more popular vehicles, such as the newly
redesigned 1991 minivans. The major Japanese auto makers
haven't yet released their 1991 prices.
   GM mailed detailed 1991 price lists to dealers Friday. It
also issued a statement that said prices on 1991 models would
rise an average 2.3% from current prices of "comparably
equipped" 1990 models.
   But that figure doesn't reflect the actual increases in
base prices compared with a year ago, because it factors out
increases in 1991 base prices related to new standard
equipment that was optional in the 1990 model year. Moreover,
GM raised some 1990 model prices earlier this summer. And the
company isn't offering discounts on most 1991 models now
being delivered to dealers. That means these vehicles will
cost consumers hundreds and even thousands of dollars more
than remaining 1990 models.
   Separately, GM idled two more assembly plants in the wake
of a strike at a parts plant in Flint, Mich. The strike,
which began Wednesday, has now forced GM to shut factories in
Shreveport, La., Pontiac, Mich., and Moraine, Ohio, which
build compact sport utility vehicles. Some 6,900 workers at
the assembly plants have been laid off. More shutdowns are
expected this week unless the strike is resolved. The No. 1
auto maker also said a parts shortage unrelated to the Flint
walkout will force it to idle 2,900 workers at its car
assembly plant in Fairfax, Kan., for at least one week.
