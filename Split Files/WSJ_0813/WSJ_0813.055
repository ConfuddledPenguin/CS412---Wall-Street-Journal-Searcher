   Saddam Hussein seems to be warming to his new role as the
world's most demonic character. What else is one to make of
the phantasmagoria of images and religious incantations that
he released in a statement Friday? "O Arabs, O Moslems, O
believers in God wherever you are. This is your day to rise
and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca, which is captive
of the spears of the Americans and the Zionist," said Saddam,
who seems to have undergone a conversion on the road to
Riyadh. Saddam, heretofore thought to be running a homicidal
secular Islamic state, has suddenly got religion. "Arabs,
Moslems, believers in God wherever you are. This is your day
to jump up and defend Mecca, hostage of the Americans." The
Iraqi theologian is offering a fairly hot crusade: "Burn the
soil under their feet. Burn the soil under the feet of the
aggressors and invaders." We suspect believers in God
everywhere understand the dangers of being caught on the
wrong side of a wind-blown, albeit holy, chemical attack.
