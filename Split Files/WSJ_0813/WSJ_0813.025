   WASHINGTON -- July's 0.1% drop in producer prices suggests
that inflationary pressures were easing before the recent
tumult in the Middle East pushed up oil prices.
   The Labor Department report will make it easier for the
Federal Reserve to push down interest rates to help spur the
slowing U.S. economy. Turbulence in the bond markets and
jitters about inflation may have delayed a Fed move that now
is widely anticipated in financial markets and among Bush
administration officials.

   "Absent the still undecided energy situation, producer
inflation is not threatening the economy," said Ron
Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of
Wholesalers-Distributors. "Thus, the economic evidence
favoring lower interest rates is still compelling."
   Higher oil prices, of course, will push up producer prices
in coming months, and some economists predict this will stop
the Fed from lowering rates enough to avoid a recession.
   "Perhaps the supreme irony in these figures is that
without the Middle East crisis, the Federal Reserve's
gradualist disinflationary strategy would have been
successful," commented Gordon Richards of the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   Excluding food and energy, producer prices also declined
0.1% in July, the government statistics show. Some economists
argue that food and energy costs are so volatile they should
be ignored in trying to gauge the underlying inflation rate.
   The drop in producer prices in July, the first decline
since April, follows a 0.2% increase in June. It was led by a
0.5% drop in the cost of energy, the sixth consecutive
monthly decline. The price of energy that producers pay had
fallen steadily since January, when it soared 13.7%.
   The index for consumer food prices showed no change in
July, after dropping 0.4% in June. Like energy, food prices
for producers have shown an overall decline since their
January increase of 2.3%. The January increase in food and
energy costs has been blamed on bitterly cold weather that
increased energy usage and destroyed many winter crops.
   The producer price index measures prices received by
domestic producers. It doesn't reflect import prices or the
price of services, which has been climbing much faster than
prices of goods in recent months.
   In the past year, producer prices have risen 3.4%.
   Prices of intermediate goods, which have had some
processing, were unchanged in July. Prices of crude goods
were up 0.6%, but are still below year-earlier levels.
