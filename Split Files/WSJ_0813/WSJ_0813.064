   CALGARY, Alberta -- Poco Petroleums Ltd. and Voyager
Energy Inc. said they have called off talks aimed at merging
the two oil and natural-gas concerns after their financial
advisers weren't able to agree on an exchange ratio.
   Voyager and Poco proposed in March to merge, forming a
company that would have been one of Canada's top 12 oil and
natural gas producers. Independent committees of both
companies' boards were appointed to negotiate the terms and
conditions of a merger.

   Further details of the breakdown in discussions weren't
disclosed, and spokesmen for the two companies couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Poco, 49%-owned by Toronto-based Corona Corp., a
gold-mining concern, has about 41.1 million shares
outstanding, while Voyager has about 26 million shares
outstanding. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday,
Poco shares closed at 7.50 Canadian dollars (US$6.54), up
12.5 Canadian cents, while Voyager shares closed at C$7.125,
up 50 Canadian cents.
   Poco had cited the merger as a chance to expand its
operations and achieve a critical mass in some areas of its
exploration and development activities. The two Calgary-based
companies are predominantly natural-gas producers, and both
have most of their assets in the province of Alberta.
