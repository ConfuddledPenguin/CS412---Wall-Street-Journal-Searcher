   Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi certainly wasn't about to
take the risk.
   Arriving at the airport in Casablanca last summer for an
Arab League summit, the colonel eyed a traditional welcoming
platter of camel's milk and dates, picked up one date as if
to eat it, then slipped it into his pocket. Few of the other
Arab kings, presidents and emirs arriving on the tarmac were
inclined to risk the untested food.

   When Arab leaders gather to demonstrate brotherhood, the
paradigm is Cain and Abel. Jordan's King Hussein travels with
a private chef, and not just because he's a picky eater. He
was 15 when he watched a Palestinian gun down his grandfather
at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. But bodyguards and
food-tasters are no bar to florid proclamations that "the
great Arab heart beats as one."
   In speaking of the ties that bind them, Arabs constantly
invoke the image of family. The current Gulf conflict, they
say, is a squabble between brothers, best settled behind
closed doors. "Fraternal Iraq" was how Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak referred to Baghdad at last Friday's summit in
Cairo -- before ordering his own troops in to protect Saudi
Arabia. Saddam Hussein depicts his midnight raid on Kuwait as
reuniting an Arab family shattered by colonialism.
   To Western ears, such cant sounds cynical. But to many
Arabs, it resonates back 1,000 years, to a lost age when
unity and greatness were indeed real. Dreams of Arab
brotherhood also feed on the resentment bred during
intervening centuries, when foreign armies, from the
Crusaders to the Israelis, humiliated Arabs and carved up
their land.
   Saddam Hussein's action has exposed these fault lines in
the region, just as revolution in Eastern Europe has laid
bare old feuds between nations and ethnic groups. When the
sand settles on the current Gulf crisis, these historical
tensions will remain, leaving the Arab world in greater flux
than it has been since World War I. "Saddam," says
Palestinian political scientist, Sa'eb Erakat, "may have
opened the gates of hell in the Middle East."
   The very notion of a monolithic Arab nation has always
contained elements of Western simplification, Arab fantasy
and Israeli propaganda (20 hostile nations encircling the
tiny Jewish state, like Indians attacking a wagon train).
While there have been flashes of modern accord -- in the
1960s, under the charismatic leadership of Egypt's Gamal
Abdel Nasser -- the Gulf flare-up shows how deep the
divisions go. A short list of Arab hates reads like an
adaptation of the Tom Lehrer song, "National Brotherhood
Week": The Iraqis hate the Syrians, the Yemenis hate the
Saudis, the Jordanians hate the Kuwaitis -- and everybody
hates the Jews.
   Such enmities are inevitable in a culture so vast and
varied. Arab territory spans five time zones and is home to
some 185 million people; Casablanca is closer to Boston than
it is to Oman. Kuwait has a per capita income of $23,000;
Yemen's is about $500.
   Most Arabs are Moslem, but there also are some 10 million
Christians, including the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
and the radical Palestinian leader, George Habash. At a
synagogue in downtown Baghdad, Jews still gather in prayer,
and there are thousands of Jews in Yemen, Syria and North
Africa. Ethnically, the region includes blue-eyed Berbers,
black Nubians, Kurdish tribesmen and fair-haired Circassians.
   At its most basic, to be Arab means to speak Arabic. But
while the classical, written tongue of the Koran is uniform,
dialects are so varied that an Iraqi talking to a Libyan is
roughly like a Scottish shepherd speaking to a Mississippi
farmer. Palestinians living in Tunisia often speak to their
neighbors in French, just to be understood.
   For Westerners, time spent in the Arab world leaves
contradictory impressions: There is the impoverished
Palestinian family that piles a guest's plate with the
choicest morsels; and then the handless corpse of a pregnant
nurse, butchered by fellow Palestinians who said she
collaborated with Israel. There are evening strolls along the
Tigris River in Baghdad, where the only danger is stumbling
on an embarrassed couple kissing; and then the stench of the
desert battlefield as trucks driven by heedless Iraqi
soldiers grind tread marks into a mass of fresh Iranian
corpses.
   A language that gave the world algebra also has bequeathed
it the word "assassin," which originally referred to
hashish-eating fanatics who murdered Christians. "Infidel" is
one of the most common words in the Koran, never far from
another noun, "hellfire." To die in holy war -- which Saddam
Hussein has called on fellow Arabs to wage against Iraq's
enemies -- is to gain quick entry to heaven. Yet the chances
of being murdered in the Arab world are 30 times less than in
America.
   Saddam Hussein epitomizes the dark side of the Arab world,
one which the West has too often taken for the whole. The
Iraqi president doesn't make any secret of his attachment to
guns, torture and poison gas. His speeches are riddled with
references to plucked eyes and chopped limbs. Asked what
Saddam Hussein would have become had he been born into a
middle-class American family, one Iraq expert responds;
"either a surgeon or a mafia don."
   James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute, likens
Saddam Hussein's appeal to that of the black American
preacher, Louis Farrakhan. Both speak to "a very angry, very
alienated constituency," he says. Continuing the ghetto
analogy, he says that for many Arabs, Saddam Hussein "is the
baddest brother in town. He's tough, he's strong and nobody
owns him. Many people like that." Unfortunately, in Mr.
Zogby's view, "Saddam is a loose cannon, not a savior."
   The Arab anger President Hussein has tapped, and the dream
of a potent and united Arab world, finds its roots in the
Middle East of the 7th Century. Before Allah revealed Islam
to a Mecca camel merchant named Mohammed in 610, the term
"Arab" referred only to the scattered tribes of the Arabian
peninsula. But in the century that followed, the prophet's
disciples burst out of Arabia on camel and horseback, driving
east into India, and northwest as far as central France.
Moslem conquests continued for centuries; pirates from
Algiers even came ashore in Iceland. Though roughly one-sixth
of the world's population is Moslem, only one out of five
Moslems is Arab.
   Between roughly 750 AD and 1050 AD, the Arab domain was
bigger than the Roman Empire at its peak. While Saxons and
Franks fought over feudal Europe, scholars in Damascus, Cairo
and Baghdad translated Aristotle, and Arab doctors developed
an inoculation against smallpox. Ibn Battuta, the Arab Marco
Polo, traveled 73,000 miles in the 14th century without
venturing much outside the Dar al-Islam, or House of Islam.
   For Moslems of this period, nation and race were
unimportant; the only distinction that mattered was that
between believers and infidels -- the sole important
distinction for many Moslems today. Europeans, according to a
10th century Arab geographer, were "more like beasts than
men." Europe, of course, was contemptuous of Arabs as well;
in Dante's Inferno, Mohammed occupies the eighth circle of
hell, not far from Satan.
   The Arab world's golden age ended in feuds and foreign
invasion: first by Crusaders, then by Mongols and then by
Ottoman Turks, who by the mid-16th century had made most of
the Arab world its vassal. It is this era of Arab history,
and the European domination that followed, that created many
of the tensions being played out in the Gulf today. Haunting
monuments to past glory are everywhere: the pillars of the
Queen of Sheba's temple in Yemen, the ruins of Babylon in
Iraq, the soaring mosques of Cairo. Writes the Arabist, W.C.
Smith: "The Arab sense of bygone splendor is superb."
   So is the sense of betrayal. If Arabs seem uneasy at the
sight of U.S. troops landing in the desert, it is because
they have every reason to distrust the West. During World War
I, Arabs were victims of one of history's most blatant double
deals. The ruler of Mecca, great-grandfather of Jordan's King
Hussein, offered to help the British against the Turks in
exchange for Arabian independence. His sons set off with T.E.
Lawrence on the military adventures so romantically depicted
in the film, "Lawrence of Arabia."
   In secret, however, Britain and France crafted a scheme to
carve up the Arab world between them. In the end, France
(which already held much of North Africa) took what is now
Syria and Lebanon while Britain added the newly created
mandates of Palestine, Jordan and Iraq to its holdings in
Egypt, Sudan, Oman and Aden. Winston Churchill used to boast
that he created Jordan one Sunday afternoon with the stroke
of a pen.
   By World War II, Jews were pouring into Palestine, fleeing
Hitler. To Arabs, these Europeans looked like yet another
wave of colonial usurpers. Arabs resisted the immigration in
a conflict continuing to this day.
   To appreciate how deeply the presence of Israel is felt,
it is necessary only to turn on the television news in half a
dozen Arab capitals. The land mass that the rest of the world
knows as Israel often doesn't exist, either on maps or in
official parlance. In some states it is the "Zionist entity"
run by "the terrorist Yitzhak Shamir." Although Jordanian and
Israeli farmers gaze at each other across the narrow Jordan
River, there isn't any phone, telex or postal contact between
the two countries.
   After King Hassan of Morocco met with Israel's Shimon
Peres, Col. Gadhafi of Libya donned a white glove before
greeting the King, so he wouldn't touch what he considered
Zionist-tainted flesh. Even now, as Arab troops face off
against Iraq, Arabs acknowledge that a single Israeli bombing
raid on Iraq would force Arab nations to rally behind Saddam
Hussein.
   America's unwavering support for Israel pains Arabs,
especially those who spent their student years in the U.S.
"We get to know Americans, how fair they are, friendly and
warm, and then we see all that fairness vanish when it comes
to Israel," says U.S.-educated Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an
Egyptian academic. Many Arabs see the Gulf conflict as yet
another example of the U.S.'s double standard. They say the
U.S. is resisting Iraq with a resolve never shown during the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon and Israel's long occupation of
Palestinian land.
   Arab discomfort with the West is cultural as well. Arab
students often are repelled by the crime, drugs and relaxed
sexual mores of the West, and are only too happy to get home
to the conservative certainties of their societies.
   And certainties they are. According to the opening of the
Koran, "there is no doubt in this book." Islam has never
undergone a reformation. In Saudi Arabia, women aren't
allowed to drive and men are herded to prayer by
stick-wielding police from the "Committee for the Propagation
of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice." Even liberal Egypt has
banned a book by its Nobel Prize winner, Naguib Mafouz,
because it indirectly questions Islam.
   Mideast analysts have long focused on Islamic
fundamentalism and the Arab-Israeli conflict as the big risks
to peace in the region. But the current crisis wasn't
provoked by either: It is about money and borders. So far,
Islamic fundamentalists have divided along national lines; in
Egypt, they have condemned Iraq, while in Jordan they have
cheered it. However, all the fundamentalists deplore U.S.
involvement in the region.
   In addition to exploiting deep-seated anti-Western
feeling, Saddam Hussein is trying to inflame class tensions,
which have brewed ever since drillers first spurted oil onto
the Bahraini sands in 1932. That discovery would give rise to
the greatest transfer of wealth in human history -- from
industrialized countries to desert bedouins. By the 1970s,
Arabs who had eked out miserable lives on dates and camel
milk found themselves able to afford jetloads of fresh Maine
lobster and prime rib steak. The Persian Gulf's small ruling
families were the greatest beneficiaries, and the West
watched -- and worried -- as they amassed ever more capital.
   The oil wealth divided the Arab world. In some cases, tiny
city-states became the richest nations on earth while their
overpopulated neighbors -- many with little or no oil --
remained beggars. The rich countries, such as Kuwait,
imported Egyptians, Palestinians and others to do their labor
and invested much of their wealth in the West, breeding
further resentment and class tensions.
   It isn't surprising, then, that oil has aroused
territorial disputes as well. One reason Saddam Hussein's
land grab sent tremors through Middle East sands is that
border disputes tend to proliferate here. Damascus still
dreams of a "Greater Syria" that encompasses territory now
belonging to Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Turkey. Yemen claims
southern Saudi Arabia, and both Oman and Saudi Arabia believe
pieces of the United Arab Emirates rightly belong to them.
The Emirates are so disunited that a map of the nation is a
crazy-quilt of sheikdoms, some of which include pockets of
land inside their neighbor's boundaries. The map is also
riddled with neutral zones and lines marked "border disputed"
or "boundary undefined."
   Iraq shows how arbitrary colonial boundaries can be. The
north is populated by bitter Kurds, promised statehood that
never materialized; the south by Shi'ite Moslems with strong
links to Iran. And the area in between is home to Saddam
Hussein's ruling Sunni minority. President Hussein is so wary
of his own countrymen that his ruling clique is composed
largely of relatives and friends from his small hometown of
Tikrit.
   Since the death of Egypt's President Nasser in 1970, the
Arab nations, including Iraq, have jostled for his mantle.
Each of the major players feels it is the rightful heir to
leadership. Saudi Arabia is custodian of Islam's holy places,
Mecca and Medina, and owns the world's richest oilfields.
Syria has led the struggle against Israel and has as its
capital Damascus, the world's oldest continuously inhabited
city. Egypt has a population double that of any other Arab
country and its capital, Cairo, is the traditional seat of
Arab learning.
   Now, Saddam Hussein is making his claim for power through
military might; for added legitimacy, he says Baghdad was the
historical capital of the Arab world and claims direct
descent from Mohammed. He also publicly invokes the image of
Nebuchadnezzar, best-remembered for sacking Jerusalem and
enslaving the Jews.
   In turn, Egypt's Mr. Mubarak, whose nine-year presidency
has been characterized by cautious plodding, has emerged as
the decisive leader of the anti-Iraq camp. If Iraq is faced
down, Mr. Mubarak's unhesitating stance is likely to earn him
a blank check from grateful Gulf regimes, and even firmer
support from the West.
   Two of the region's great survivors, meanwhile, are in
trouble. The PLO leader, Yasir Arafat, is "a man standing on
a banana skin," according to an Arab political analyst.
"Arafat is a brilliant man, but we have a saying in Arabic:
The slip-up of a brilliant man is worth a thousand deadly
errors."
   Mr. Arafat has sided with Iraq, and thereby placed himself
in double jeopardy. If Iraq is smashed, Egypt and the Gulf
will exact a huge price for Mr. Arafat's disloyalty. At the
same time, if Saddam Hussein somehow outlasts the huge forces
arrayed against him, his power and prestige could transform
Mr. Arafat into an Iraqi puppet; rather than deal with him on
the Palestinian issue, negotiators might well go over his
head to the Iraqi leader.
   Jordan's King Hussein, who has deftly weathered 38 years
of crisis-ridden rule, also is playing a dangerous game,
using Iraq as a deterrent against Israel and Israel as a
deterrent against Iraq. After initially siding with Saddam
Hussein, he now has edged toward the moderate Arab camp and
risks a rebellion by his own population, which is strongly
pro-Iraq.
   Syria's Hafez Assad, an archrival of Saddam Hussein, has
been drawn closer to moderates such as Egypt. Syria may
become, if not a U.S. ally, at least less of an enemy than it
has been for decades. And Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, by making
the tough decision to invite U.S. forces into his country,
has shown some rare political forcefulness. The sedentary
monarch has long been plagued by orthopedic problems, and
whenever he failed to show up at heated Arab meetings, Arab
wits blamed it on the King's "weak knees." Because he has now
taken a firm stance, the King also risks appearing as a U.S.
lackey, calling in infidel troops to defend Islam's holy
land.
   But Saddam Hussein's call for a religious "uprising" in
Saudi Arabia hasn't yet yielded much response, says Abdala
Meer Mosa, a Saudi Shi'ite dissident who usually opposes the
monarchy. "I don't think anyone is fooled by Saddam's `jihad'
-- everyone knows he's a butcher, a torturer, and the way he
captured Kuwait is something horrible." Mr. Mosa said even
dissidents recognize that Saudi King Fahd had little choice
but to call for foreign help.
   Still, some Arabs worry that U.S. forces, once in, will
prove difficult to dislodge. They fear that Saudi Arabia will
become one big U.S. base, garrisoned by Americans determined
to protect future oil supplies.
   These sorts of fears -- and the splits they are causing in
the Arab world -- were apparent at Friday's hastily convened
Arab summit, where just 12 of the 20 Arab League members
voted to send forces to Saudi Arabia. Iraq, Libya, and the
PLO rejected the proposal outright, while key states such as
Jordan and Algeria wavered in a meeting so acrimonious that
the Kuwaiti emir stormed out and another member of the royal
family fainted. At one point an Iraqi reportedly threw a
plate of food at the Kuwaiti delegation. Now, with Arab
troops arrayed against each other on the Saudi border, the
dream of brotherhood seems more distant than ever before.
   Egyptians have long told a wistful joke about Arab
divisions. A trumpeter stands outside the Arab League
headquarters in Cairo. Asked why he is there, the musician
says, "I'm supposed to blow my horn when Arab unity comes."
   "And how much are you paid?"
   "Fifteen pounds a month."
   "That's nothing]"
   "I know," the trumpeter says. "But it's a lifetime job."
