   MILLBRAE, Calif. -- Homestead Financial Corp. reported a
surprising $30.2 million net loss for the second quarter,
reflecting loss reserves mostly associated with the
California real estate market.
   The $2.7 billion-asset parent of Homestead Savings cited
an $18 million general loss reserve established in the wake
of recent regulatory examinations as well as a $16.7 million
provision for potential losses on the planned sale of four
apartment complexes owned by its land development subsidiary.
The company added that the sale of the apartment complexes,
representing $129.9 million in assets, was part of a plan to
improve capital.

   The net loss equaled $2.66 a share, compared with a net
loss of $18.7 million, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier.
Homestead said the latest loss left the thrift unit out of
compliance with federal minimum tangible capital rules, and
that it would be amending a filing with regulators regarding
plans for improving its capital position.
   Homestead's situation points up how the nation's real
estate woes are starting to afflict even the perennially
healthy California market. A number of banks and thrifts in
the state have recently reported growing loan troubles from
real estate, reflecting the effect of high residential
prices, a glut of commercial space and a growing credit
crunch affecting developers that is a direct effect of the
S&amp;L debacle.
   Charles J. Vaughan, Homestead's executive vice president
and chief operating officer, said the latest losses largely
reflect problems with the thrift's real estate subsidiary
that is being hurt because potential developers and buyers
are having trouble getting financing. "If you have to own
real estate in the U.S., most people would rather own it in
California. But what this says is that when you have a
tightening of credit nationwide, no state is totally immune,"
he said.
   Homestead said that, excluding loss provisions, its net
interest income for the quarter increased to $8.7 million
from $5.2 million a year earlier.
   For the six months, Homestead reported a net loss of $25.7
million, or $2.26 a share, compared with a net loss of $40.1
million, or $3.55 a share, a year earlier.
