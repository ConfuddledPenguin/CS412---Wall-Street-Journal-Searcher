   MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said it will increase its
domestic fares by 5.3%, effective Aug. 15, because of higher
fuel costs.
   The carrier cited Iraq's invasion of Kuwait for the fare
rise. Several other airlines have boosted fares, or tacked on
surcharges, since the Middle East crisis sent crude oil
skyward.

   Eastern said the increase will not apply to passengers
holding special weekend fare reservations for travel between
now and Aug. 28.
