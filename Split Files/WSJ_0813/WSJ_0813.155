   TORONTO -- Ford Motor Co. said it has agreed to inject
cash into Magna International Inc., one of Ford's major
outside suppliers of auto parts, in order to ensure a
continued supply of plastic bumpers from the financially
strapped company.
   Neither company would reveal the size of Ford's
investment, but Toronto-based Magna said the deal represents
a "major step" in its program to restructure 1.09 billion
Canadian dollars (US$949.5 million) in debt.

   Magna spokesman Brian Colburn called the agreement with
Ford a "vote of confidence" in Magna's ability to continue
operating. Magna, which has been plagued by overcapacity and
a slowdown in the auto industry, supplies parts to all of the
Big Three U.S. auto makers.
   Under terms of the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will
acquire 49% and Magna will own 51% of a new company, Conix
Canada Inc., that has been set up to acquire various assets
from Magna's Decoma International Inc. unit. The assets
include a new 530,000 square-foot plastic bumper
manufacturing plant in Guelph, Ontario. The plant, which will
employ about 500 people after production gets under way early
next year, will eventually replace a smaller facility
currently in use in Toronto, Mr. Colburn said.
   The joint venture company also will acquire Magna's
mould-making plant in Concord, Ontario, which has 130
employees.
   In addition, Magna said Ford has agreed to purchase the
property of Magna's interior component manufacturing plant in
Nashville, Ill., and to lease the facility back to Magna.
Ford also will provide a loan to a Magna subsidiary in the
U.S.
   The pact with Ford is Magna's second significant move to
reduce its debt load since the company announced in March it
was in technical default on some of its bank loans. Last
month, Magna said it agreed to sell its automotive electric
motors division to a unit of Siemens AG of West Germany.
Analysts estimated that deal was worth about C$70 million.
   Mr. Colburn said Magna is negotiating with its creditors
to secure a standstill agreement on the company's loans. He
said Magna aims to cut its debt load by about half over the
next 12 months.
