   For decades Albania was viewed as a hermit country, its
people completely cut off from news of the West and content
with Communist poverty. The recent exodus of 5,000 refugees
to the West has shattered that myth. It turns out Albanians
are well informed about freedom, in large part from listening
to U.S.-sponsored broadcasts such as the Voice of America.
   Amazingly, many of the refugees speak English, which they
had painstakingly taught themselves by listening to the VOA.
The knowledge that the Iron Curtain had fallen gave them the
courage to try fleeing from the last Stalinist regime in
Europe.

   For 40 years, the VOA along with Radio Free Europe and
Radio Liberty (which broadcasts to the Soviet Union) have
beamed objective news into nations lacking a free press. They
played a significant role in the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe. Lech Walesa has said that without Radio Free
Europe's Polish broadcasts, Solidarity would have ceased to
exist.
   Now that communism is becoming a spent historical force,
many in Congress are calling for a swift end to U.S. funding
of Radio Free Europe and a curtailment of VOA's budget. They
fail to recognize that having helped win the Cold War, U.S.
radio stations are greatly needed to secure the peace in
Eastern Europe. In addition, people in oppressed regions of
Asia and Africa still desperately need the news and culture
they provide.
   Radio Free Europe can still perform a vital role in the
nations of Eastern Europe, which may have freedom of speech
but still lack broadbased broadcasting outlets independent of
the state. RFE's programming, for instance, now includes
tutorials on building democratic institutions, the role of a
free press and creating free markets.
   The new democratic leaders of Eastern Europe welcome RFE's
continued competition. In May, Czechoslovakia's President
Vaclav Havel said: "I believe the freedom today enjoyed by
our mass media does not at all mean that RFE has lost its
meaning." He added, "There are numberless spheres where it
can continue to serve our nations well at this time -- better
than our own mass media."
   It is likely that in five or 10 years Radio Free Europe
will have outlived its usefulness in countries such as
Czechoslovakia. At that point, Steve Forbes, head of the
Board for International Broadcasting, suggests that certain
RFE services be privatized and sold to local interests. Until
then, continued funding of Radio Free Europe's mission is one
of the best ways the U.S. can help ensure a prosperous and
stable Europe.
   This fall a bipartisan commission will evaluate the work
of both Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the VOA, and make
recommendations to Congress on their future. Despite budget
pressures, the $360 million annual investment in U.S.-funded
radio networks should be maintained. The dividends from their
work will continue to pour in for years.
