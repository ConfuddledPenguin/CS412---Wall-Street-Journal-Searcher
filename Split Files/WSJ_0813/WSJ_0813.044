   Polymer Gel Can Shrink
   And Swell Like a Muscle

   ARTIFICIAL muscles are among the potential uses of
light-sensitive gels developed by a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology scientist.
   Toyoichi Tanaka, professor of physics, is working with
Jell-O-like polymers that can be made to shrink and swell
under various conditions. Earlier this year, Mr. Tanaka and
his colleagues described a polymer gel that swelled up when
it was struck by ultraviolet light and then collapsed when it
was plunged into the dark. The reaction, however, was too
slow to be useful.
   Now, the physicist and Atsushi Suzuki, a visiting
colleague from Yokohama National University in Japan, report
a new polymer gel that rapidly responds to visible light. The
secret was incorporating chlorophyll, the molecule that
plants use to convert sunlight to chemical energy.
   The new gel collapses to less than half its original
volume in a few thousandths of a second wherever a beam of
visible light strikes it. When the light is turned off, the
shrunken portion of the gel almost instantly expands to its
original volume, according the two scientists' report in a
recent issue of the journal Nature. In tiny cylinders of the
gel, each about the diameter of a muscle fiber, the degree of
shrinkage could be controlled by varying the intensity of the
light beam, the scientists report.
   Gels that change size in response to an electric current
have been proposed for making artificial sphincter muscles
for the bladders of paralyzed and incontinent people. But Mr.
Tanaka suggests that gels that respond to light beams,
delivered perhaps by optical fibers, might be safer for
implanting in the body.
   Other possible uses include light-controlled switches and
a solar engine in which cylinders of the gel shrink and
expand as they rotate in and out of the sunlight. Mr. Tanaka
is patenting the new gels and hints that he already has a
possible licensee lined up.

   Father Gets Back Marrow
   That He Donated to Son
                                                                                                       

   CANCER specialists in London report a medical variation of
the Golden Rule.
   Back in 1980, doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in
Surrey, England, cured a 12-year-old boy of leukemia by
destroying his cancer-ridden bone marrow with radiation. Then
they gave the boy a transplant of bone marrow donated by his
father. Because the father's marrow didn't exactly match the
son's, the boy suffered repeated medical problems in the
months afterward. Finally, the father's donated marrow
"took," the boy recovered, returned to school and graduated,
the British doctors report in the Lancet.
   In late 1987, the 45-year-old father came down with
another type of leukemia that, by a rare coincidence, also
was treatable by radiation and bone marrow transplant. Tests
of the son showed that contrary to scientists' predictions,
the boy's native marrow hadn't revived. Instead, the father's
transplanted marrow continued to thrive. In April 1988, the
doctors took some of the father's marrow from the son and
retransplanted it to the father. A year later, the father was
free of all signs of leukemia.
                                                                                                       

   `Smart Glass' Could Trim
   Bulk of Camera Lenses
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS at a small limited partnership in Arizona claim
they've developed "smart glass" for new kinds of eyeglasses,
camera lenses and other optical devices.
   Isotec in Tucson says it has discovered a way to make a
single glass lens that will bend light by several different
angles, a "gradient refractive index" (GRIN) lens. Most glass
lenses refract light by only a single angle determined by the
curvature of the lens.
   Currently, to bend light by different angles requires
lining up several lenses. A standard wide-angle camera lens,
for example, might require six successive lenses to take
light from angles ranging from the far left to the far right
and to focus it on film.
   In one of Isotec's configurations, the center sections of
the lens bend light at different angles from the outer
sections. This makes possible a wide-angle camera lens
consisting of only one or two GRIN lenses, says Leslie
Danziger, Isotec's chief executive officer. For the same
reason, GRIN binoculars could be more compact than ordinary
ones.
   In communications, a GRIN lens could be used to merge or
"multiplex" several message-carrying light beams into a
single beam for long-distance transmission via a single
optical fiber. The beam could then be "demultiplexed" by a
GRIN lens at the receiving end, a trick that until now has
been used only in electronic communications.
   Isotec says the university and company scientists it has
funded can fuse glasses with different refractive indexes --
light-bending properties -- into a single lens of almost any
desired size. Isotec wants to license the technology to other
companies, Ms. Danziger says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

are using the least stressful position for carrying the tray.
. . . Home insulation impregnated with a new cockroach
repellent invented by U.S. Agriculture Department researchers
will be tested in some roach-infested homes in Florida. . . .
Instead of preventing swelling of the gums and jaw after
dental surgery, as expected, aspirin increases swelling,
according to tests at the University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry
of New Jersey. . . . Treadmill tests of the black racer snake
at the University of California, Irvine, show legless
creatures use as much energy to travel as legged animals of
the same weight.
