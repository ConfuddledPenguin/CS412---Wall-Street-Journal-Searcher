   AVON, Mass. -- Child World Inc. said its board unanimously
approved the previously announced purchase by Toys Plus Inc.
of the 18% of Child World's shares that are currently in
public hands. The purchase price will be $14 a share, or $28
million.
   Toys Plus recently was formed by Trefoil Capital Investors
Limited Partnership, which last month agreed to purchase CNC
Holding Corp.'s 82% stake in Child World in a "non-cash
transaction." Terms of that transaction haven't been
announced, and Child World said negotiations concerning it
are continuing.

   CNC is a Cleveland-based holding company. Trefoil was
formed by the executives of Shamrock Holdings Inc., a holding
company controlled by Roy E. Disney, a California investor
and nephew of the late Walt Disney.
   Child World, the nation's second-largest toy retailer
after Toys "R" Us Inc., said its merger with Toys Plus is
conditioned on Trefoil's prior purchase of the CNC stake in
the retailer. Child World would be the surviving corporation
after the merger. Trefoil earlier said it plans to retain
Child World's current management.
   Child World, which operates 175 toy supermarkets in 31
states, has been squeezed for capital. Last year, the company
cut overall inventories 8.1% to save cash. For the first
quarter, ended May 5, Child World reported sharply higher
losses of $7.4 million, or 65 cents a share, because of a
shortage of sale items after the 1989 Christmas season.
   Child World said its board found Trefoil's $14-a-share
offer for its public stock "to be fair and in the best
interests" of shareholders. Trefoil earlier said that its
capital could help reinvigorate the cashstarved retailer.
