   CHICAGO -- There are horse races, dog races, even turtle
races. But duck races?
   Suddenly, they're all the rage. Duck dashes have recently
been held on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and the
Elizabeth Park Canal outside Detroit. Later this month, an
estimated 50,000 ducks are expected to compete here on the
Chicago River.

   But don't expect thousands of sore losers to fly away and,
well, befoul the festive event. These duck races, a new type
of charity fund-raiser, use fist-sized, nontoxic,
yellow-rubber ducks sporting black sunglasses and painted-on
smiles.
   The child-abuse unit of the Illinois Masonic Medical
Center is sponsoring Chicago's giant birdbath. Organizers
here and elsewhere rent the racing ducks from leasing
companies and then round up sponsors to adopt the birds,
usually for $5 a duck. Each duck is numbered on its
underbelly, and that and other information is fed into a
computer program called Quack Track.
   For the Chicago race, the web-footed racers will be dumped
off the Michigan Avenue bridge and propelled along the river
by fire-department water cannons. Their top speed usually is
nine miles an hour. The first duck that pops out of a chute
at the finish line wins. Among the prizes: a paddle boat.
   The race "is pretty strange," concedes George Broustis, an
administrative aide at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District here. City officials say it's the weirdest river
event since folks began dyeing the river green each St.
Patrick's Day.
   Charity groups are all aflutter over the fund-raiser.
"It's so warm and fuzzy," says Susan Harris, a race organizer
at Illinois Masonic. Still, the ducks ruffled feathers in
Santa Rosa, Calif., when environmentalists opposed a race on
the Russian River. They feared the ducks would float into the
Pacific Ocean, 13 miles downstream, and end up choking sea
lions.
   Great American Duck Races, a Phoenix, Ariz., company that
leases the ducks, says the number of races it supplies is
soaring -- to 38 last year from eight in 1988. This year's
total should top 100, and 105 are scheduled for next year.
   For the Chicago race, the unresolved question is how to
dump that many ducks into the river all at the same time.
Some ideas already nixed: by dump truck, helicopter, laundry
chute or cement mixer. "The ducks might get smooshed,"
worries Dawn Cielec, a race volunteer from Motorola Inc., a
corporate sponsor.
