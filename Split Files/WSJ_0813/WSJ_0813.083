   UNMILITARY JAPAN

   Few young men want to join the Japanese military, and
those who are in it complain of low pay, bad working
conditions and little public recognition.
   Those serving in what are officially called "the
Self-Defense Forces" labor under a handicap unique among the
world's major countries. The constitution, adopted a year
after Japan's defeat in World War II, renounces war.
   Thus, Japanese soldiers haven't been involved in combat
since 1945. Overseas military involvement is banned, the
military adopts a very low profile in public life and the
public remains acutely sensitive to any hint of militarism.
   "We are facing difficulties in recruiting young people,"
said Rear Adm. Yasuaki Imaizumi at the Etajima First Service
Naval School in Kure on Japan's Inland Sea. A senior naval
officer said more than half of his 50 classmates in aviation
school now work for commercial airlines. "I can't blame them.
As far as pay is concerned, there is no way I can compete
with them," he said.
                                                                                                       

   LOANS TO VENEZUELA
                                                                                                       

   Japanese banks won't make new loans to Venezuela because
they are dissatisfied with the progress of its economic
restructuring, international banking sources told a Japanese
news agency. The decision is based on a perception that the
Venezuelan economy has shown little improvement despite
higher oil prices, the sources said. Venezuela's medium-term
to long-term foreign debts total about $20 billion, of which
20% is owed to 30 Japanese banks.
                                                                                                       

   NISSAN'S CFC PHASE-OUT
                                                                                                       

   Nissan Motor Co. said it will completely phase out
chlorofluorocarbon gas from air conditioners on its new cars
by the end of 1995. In addition, the company will install CFC
recycling devices at its service centers and used-car
dealerships world-wide by March 1992. Two other major auto
makers, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., have
announced similar plans to eliminate the gas. CFC gas is
suspected of damaging the atmosphere's ozone layer, which
acts as a shield against the sun's harmful rays.
                                                                                                       

   LUFTHANSA'S BERLIN PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Lufthansa said it applied to serve West Berlin and East
Berlin as of the start of its winter flight plan on Oct. 28.
The carrier, which is 51%-owned by the West German
government, hasn't been allowed to make scheduled flights to
Berlin since the end of World War II. Only airlines of the
four victorious World War II powers have been allowed to fly
to Berlin.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA-HONG KONG RAILROAD
                                                                                                       

   China plans to construct a 1,465-mile railroad line
between Beijing and Hong Kong in preparation for the
scheduled return of the British crown colony to China in
1997, the China Daily reported. The Ministry of Railways
estimated the total construction cost at the equivalent of
$3.3 billion, of which 20% to 25% will be borne by the
provinces and municipalities along the projected route. The
railroad will be built between the present Beijing-Shanghai
and Beijing-Guangzhou lines, linking 10 provinces and
municipalities.
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINE INFLATION
                                                                                                       

   Argentine President Carlos Menem threatened to open the
door to imported goods to cut the nation's inflation rate.
His comments were in response to reports that prices have
risen by 10% so far this month. The rise in the nation's
consumer prices had slowed steadily in the past few months,
to a monthly rate of 10.8% in July from 95.5% in March, but
now shows signs of accelerating.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICAN DRUG ABUSE
                                                                                                       

   Although narcotics abuse hasn't reached epidemic
proportions in Mexico, such cheap inhalants as glue, paint
thinner and other industrial solvents are becoming popular
among the nation's poor, and fears are growing that Mexico is
fertile ground for drug addiction.
   One reason is the availability of a wide variety of
illegal drugs. Marijuana and opium poppies are grown in
Mexico, and the country is a transit point for cocaine and
heroin bound for the U.S. from South America.
   The latest National Survey of Addictions, conducted in
1988 and released this year, found that 4.3% of Mexicans,
more than half of them under age 34, had experimented with
drugs at least once. And the federal attorney general's
office said that of an estimated 500,000-plus drug addicts in
Mexico, 300,000 use inhalants, 200,000 use marijuana, 30,000
use cocaine and the rest use heroin or opium.
   A half pint of paint thinner costs the equivalent of seven
cents, and a tube of glue $1.07. Street prices for marijuana
and cocaine, respectively, are about $1.80 a cigarette and
$35 a gram.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A liaison council of officials from 15 Japanese ministries
and agencies, discussing ways to increase the nation's
birthrate, said it is considering changes in the system of
maternity leave, improvements in housing policies and better
child-care services. . . . Anticipating history, the National
Geographic Society said it is unifying East and West Germany
in the sixth edition of its world atlas due out in November.
