   EVANSTON, Ill. -- Washington National Corp. said it
approved the additional buy-back of 750,000 shares of common
stock.
   The company said it approved the purchases because its
board believes its stock is undervalued at recent price
levels. In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, the stock
closed at 18.875, up 50 cents.
