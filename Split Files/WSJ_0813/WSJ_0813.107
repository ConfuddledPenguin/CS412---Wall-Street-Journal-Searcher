   LONDON -- Fresh evidence of a British economic slowdown
emerged from a study showing sluggish consumer spending and
slow retail sales growth.
   The Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly
survey of distributive trades found low growth in retailing
activity across the United Kingdom. The survey also found
that demand among wholesalers and automobile companies was
lower than a year ago.

   "The economic slowdown is continuing to have a pervasive
impact throughout the distributive trades," said the report,
to be released today. The report provides fresh evidence that
the British government's tight-money policy is beginning to
slow consumer activity.
   Despite a modest rise in monthly retail demand, orders by
retailers were no higher than a year ago, the survey found.
Particularly hard hit have been machinery and
office-equipment sales and the auto industry.
   "We are now witnessing a fall in distributors sales as a
whole for the first time since the survey began seven years
ago," said Andrew Sentance, the confederation's director of
economic affairs.
