   Evans Inc. said it received a $33.5 million revolving
credit arrangement from a bank and an insurance company that
gives the specialty retailer more financial flexibility.
   Chicago-based Evans wouldn't name the lenders. The working
capital loan agreement, secured by all Evans's assets, also
stretches out some principal payments on a note payable.

   Evans had a loss of $3.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in
the quarter ended June 2, on sales of $20.3 million. David B.
Meltzer, chairman, said the new financing means the company
"can now focus on the execution of our business plan."
