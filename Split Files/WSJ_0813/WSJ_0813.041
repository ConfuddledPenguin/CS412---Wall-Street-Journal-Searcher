   PONTIAC, Mich. -- First Federal Bancorp said a temporary
restraining order in effect against the federal Office of
Thrift Supervision was indefinitely extended by the
Cincinnatti Court of Appeals.
   The restraining order was to have ended Friday. It will
give First Federal officials time to appeal a federal
district judge's denial for a preliminary injunction that
will prevent federal regulators from appointing a conservator
or receiver for a First Federal subsidiary.
