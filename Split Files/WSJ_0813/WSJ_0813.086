   WASHINGTON -- The ambiguous verdict on Marion Barry --
certainly a personal victory for the capital's mayor -- will
leave deep scars in a city torn by drug crimes and divided by
racial tension.
   For immediate practical purposes, the mayor beat the
federal case against him by escaping with a conviction on
only one misdemeanor cocaine-possession count. The jury
acquitted him of another possession charge and was deadlocked
on 12 other counts. Mr. Barry, cheered by supporters at
weekend appearances, is said to be considering another run
for public office, most likely for an at-large city council
seat.

   But the fact remains that the mayor -- who for years had
denied drug-related allegations and preached abstinence in
city schools -- was found guilty of cocaine possession, and
his lawyer conceded to the jury that Mr. Barry indulged in
the drug.
   The city will long be haunted by the image of its chief
executive admitting to criminal activity, said Jack
Friedenthal, dean of George Washington University's law
school. Also, Mr. Friedenthal added, "You are left with
terrible feelings, terrible divisiveness on the racial
issue."
   The eight-week Barry trial not only shook up the city, but
had reverberations as far away as Colombia, where political
commentators interpreted the verdict as an endorsement of
tolerance that would undercut efforts in that country to
fight cocaine trafficking, violence and corruption.
   The white U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, portrayed the trial
results as justification for a massive federal investigation
of the mayor and his associates. Even the lone conviction,
the prosecutor said, "emphatically emphasizes that no one is
above the law."
   But as Mr. Stephens spoke Friday outside the U.S.
courthouse near the Capitol, a black crowd nearly shouted him
down with warnings to "get out of town" and chants of "Barry,
Barry, Barry] Four More Years]" After the mayor delivered an
emotional apology to supporters at a foot-stomping rally
Saturday, arguments broke out on the street between whites
and blacks.
   Mr. Barry, though appearing humble about his personal
failings, stopped well short of admitting to any criminal
guilt. At his rally Saturday, he reiterated charges that
white prosecutors and journalists had singled him out for
racial reasons. Some civil rights leaders, including Benjamin
Hooks, also have contended that the Justice Department has
targeted Mr. Barry and other black politicians.
   "My trial has helped expose deep divisions and racism in
our community that are reflective of what is happening around
the nation," Mr. Barry said.
   "American citizens," he continued, "should not have to
walk around in fear that their constitutional rights and
civil liberties are being eroded and trampled, and Big
Brother is all powerful and all knowing." Prosecutors all the
way up to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have denied that
the Barry prosecution was racially motivated.
   Much remains unclear about the city's political future and
that of its three-term chief executive. Mr. Barry isn't
expected to reverse his decision not to seek re-election as
mayor, but he hasn't committed himself on whether he will run
for the city council, where he served in the 1970s. Today is
the deadline for Mr. Barry to switch his party registration
to independent from Democratic to qualify for the November
ballot. If he does switch, he would have two weeks to decide
whether to run.
   Another Barry campaign would almost certainly stir racial
animosity and keep the spotlight on the propriety of the
federal government's tactics in prosecuting him. Law
enforcement officials said that continuing investigations of
city contract abuse have been stalled by the Barry verdict
and could be derailed altogether if U.S. Attorney Stephens
decides not to retry the mayor. On the other hand, Mr.
Stephens has said that the government held back on bringing
some charges against Mr. Barry, and it is possible that the
prosecutor could seek a new, even broader indictment.
   Mr. Stephens said he won't reveal his decision until a
hearing scheduled for Sept. 17. Prosecutors said they will
interview jurors to find out whether the panel came close to
conviction on any of the 12 drug and perjury counts on which
they deadlocked.
   Weighing against a new prosecution was the account of one
of the few jurors who answered reporters' questions over the
weekend. Johnnie Mae Hardeman said that after eight days of
deliberation, the panel had split 6-6 or 7-5 for acquittal on
the three felony perjury counts, although she didn't recall
the results in detail.
   City Council Chairman David Clarke, a Democratic candidate
for mayor, said, "I'm very sorry for this city that the mayor
has been found guilty on the one charge." But Mr. Clarke, who
is white, urged the prosecution "to let the city go," and not
retry Mr. Barry.
   Mr. Friedenthal of George Washington University said, "The
point has been made: He {Mr. Barry} used cocaine." The legal
academic predicted a plea bargain under which Mr. Barry would
admit to another misdemeanor or two in exchange for the
prosecution's dropping all other charges. Judges in
Washington rarely, if ever, sentence first-time drug
posession offenders to jail.
   Mr. Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, said, "It is time
for each side to extend the olive branch." But his success in
turning the tables and putting the federal government's
tactics on trial may prompt his client to refuse any plea
agreement.
   Mr. Mundy dispatched the prosecution's evidence that the
mayor used cocaine on more than 200 occasions by simply
admitting that Mr. Barry was an occasional user. In effect,
the lawyer invited one or more findings of guilt on the
lesser possession counts as a compromise, while stressing
that the government witnesses all "had something to gain" by
cooperating with prosecutors.
   Among the charges on which the jury couldn't agree was the
possession count based on a videotaped sting that caught Mr.
Barry smoking crack in a Washington hotel room. He had been
lured there and encouraged to use the potent cocaine
derivative by a former woman friend cooperating with
investigators. Mr. Mundy painstakingly guided the jury in
dissecting the 82-minute videotape, building a defense that
the mayor had been entrapped.
   The prosecution's failure to convict even with filmed
evidence of Mr. Barry's drug use will certainly demoralize
some federal and local police in Washington, law enforcement
officials predicted. But investigators here and elsewhere
aren't likely to drop tactics such as undercover stings and
reliance on testimony from witnesses themselves implicated in
criminal activity. "In a dirty business, you deal with dirty
people," said one federal investigator.
