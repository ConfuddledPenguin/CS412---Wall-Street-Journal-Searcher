   Edison Brothers Stores Inc., moving to expand its group of
menswear stores, plans to acquire Webster Clothes Inc. for
$19.2 million.
   St. Louis-based Edison said it agreed to pay $6 a share
for Webster's common stock. Fifty cents a share will be
placed in escrow, subject to certain events and adjustments.
A Webster official said the company will disclose details of
the contingencies on Monday in its merger filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain Webster
shareholders, who own 80% of the stock, have granted Edison
an option to purchase their shares at the merger price.

   The merger, subject to approval by Webster shareholders as
well as other conditions, is expected to close in late
September, Edison said.
   Edison operates about 1,200 menswear stores. Webster,
based in Baltimore, operates 128 young men's clothing stores
under the names Webster, Zeidler &amp; Zeidler, and Aggio.
