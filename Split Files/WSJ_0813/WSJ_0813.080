   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., seeking to build its
fast-growing business in Britain, said its British joint
venture plans to invest $187 million to build a new
soft-drink plant.
   The joint venture, Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages Ltd.,
is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola and 51%-owned by Cadbury Schweppes
PLC.

   The plant, to be completed in the spring of 1992, will be
located in southern England, possibly in Banbury or
Northampton.
   The announcement of the new plant comes on the heels of
the opening of another plant the joint venture recently
completed in Wakefield, in northern England. The Wakefield
plant is the largest soft-drink production facility in
Europe. Like the Wakefield plant, the new facility will
produce soft drinks in plastic bottles and cans.
   Coca-Cola will need the extra plant capacity, according to
a spokesman, to keep up with growing demand. Unlike the U.S.,
where the soft-drink market is more mature and limped along
at a 2.5% growth rate last year, industry soda volumes in the
U.K. jumped 13%. And sales of Coke products in that country
are growing at double to triple that rate, the spokesman
said.
   The joint venture's job is to boost consumption levels by
making soft drinks more available in restaurants, vending
machines and grocery stores, and by generating advertising to
increase public awareness of the products.
