   THE HAGUE -- The Dutch balance of trade slid into a
deficit of 900 million guilders (US$500 million) in May but
registered a surplus of 2.2 billion guilders for the first
five months of this year, the Netherlands Economics Ministry
said.
   The May deficit resulted from a strong 9% rise in the
value of imports at a time when exports were falling 2%.
Imports in May were valued at 20.6 billion guilders compared
with 19.6 billion guilders of exports.
