   Unilever Group said its net income for the second quarter
grew about 12% before taking into account
currency-translation effects.
   But the Anglo-Dutch maker of food, detergents and
toiletries said it views the second half with "a measure of
caution." Floris Maljers, chairman of the group's Dutch arm,
Unilever N.V., said the caution stems from sputtering
economic growth in the U.S. and Britain and from fears that
the recent surge in oil prices will squeeze consumer spending
world-wide.

   The results were roughly in line with most forecasts, but
the company's warning made some investors nervous, London
brokers said. On the London Stock Exchange, shares of the
group's British arm, Unilever PLC, traded late Friday at 661
pence, compared with 670 pence late Thursday. Shares of the
Dutch arm, Unilever N.V., closed at $82.125, down 62.5 cents,
compared with 149.30 guilders, on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange.
   Second-quarter net income grew 18% to $516 million, or
$1.84 a share of Unilever N.V., from $436 million, or $1.56 a
share. Sales climbed 14% to $9.37 billion from $8.19 billion.
   In the first half, net advanced 16% to $898 million, or
$3.20 a share, from $773 million, or $2.76 a share. Sales
totaled $17.77 billion, up 14% from $15.6 billion.
   For the first half, the company's operating profit margin
edged up to 9.1% from 9% a year earlier, although the margin
in North America shrank to 6.5% from 7.6%.
   Operating profit in Europe for the half grew 14% to $978
million. The company said detergents, toiletries, food and
drinks were particularly strong.
   Unilever said it was pleased with its progress in East
Germany. Mr. Maljers said that direct sales to that country
totaled about 60 million marks ($37.5 million) in the half
and that a similar amount of Unilever products made their way
into East Germany via third parties. By contrast, Mr. Maljers
said, Unilever's West German sales are likely to total around
nine billion marks for all of 1990.
   In Hungary, Mr. Maljers said Unilever is still awaiting
decisions from government officials on a proposed joint
venture with a state-owned company. The venture would make
margarine and detergents, and Unilever probably would have
majority control, he said.
   The company's salmon farming unit in Scotland remained a
problem. In 1989, that unit produced a loss estimated at #11
million ($58.8 million). Mr. Maljers said Unilever isn't
ready to abandon the business, despite low prices for salmon.
   North American operating profit in the first half was
unchanged at $254 million. Mr. Maljers said results from
margarine and specialty chemicals improved but competition
intensified in detergents. Unilever, whose detergent brands
include Wisk and Surf, is spending more on promotion to keep
market share, he said.
   Unilever said its new "personal products" lines in the
U.S. performed in line with expectations. The company last
year acquired the U.S.-based Faberge, Elizabeth Arden and
Calvin Klein cosmetic and perfume lines for a total of about
$1.8 billion. Snarls in Faberge's computer system have slowed
integration of that unit.
   Outside Europe and North America, operating profit surged
31% in the half to $385 million. Most of the gains were in
Latin America, where the company said results "advanced
strongly in spite of difficult economic circumstances." Mr.
Maljers said benefits are starting to flow from major
acquisitions of food and detergent companies in Brazil, Chile
and Mexico over the past five years.
   But Unilever said tougher competition hurt results in
Japan. Mr. Maljers said its shampoos were particularly hard
hit. The company sells Timotei and Lux shampoos in Japan.
   In what analysts see as the start of a costly battle,
Unilever recently began test-marketing of concentrated Surf
detergent in Japan; Mr. Maljers said it was too early to
gauge results. Richard Workman, an analyst at Hoare Govett in
London, said a successful launch of Surf in Japan would be a
huge breakthrough. But, he added, "they're playing for high
stakes; they might get a bloody nose."
