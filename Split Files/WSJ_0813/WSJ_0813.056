   NEW YORK -- Scholastic Corp., a publisher of children's
textbooks and magazines that went private in 1987, said it
plans an initial public offering of 4.2 million common shares
valued at as much as $88.2 million.
   Scholastic said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that 3.3 million shares will be offered by the company
and 930,000 shares will be put up for sale by the family of
founder Maurice R. Robinson, which controls the voting power
through a separate class of shares.

   The offering, expected in late September, will be made
concurrently in the U.S. and internationally -- 3.4 million
shares in the U.S. and 800,000 shares internationally, the
company said. The offering will be managed by Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. and Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. The offering plan provides
an overallotment to the underwriters of 630,000 shares.
   At the projected offering price of $18 to $21 a share, the
company said, the offering would raise from $75.6 million to
$88.2 million. Including the public offering, the company has
about 9.4 million shares outstanding.
   Scholastic said it intends to use proceeds from the
offering to pay bank debt. The company's debt was $46.5
million at May 31, but because Scholastic typically has a
negative cash flow during the summer months, that figure is
likely to climb before the offering is completed.
   The voting power is vested in the company's Class A stock.
Richard Robinson, chairman and chief executive officer, and
two trusts controlled by descendants of company founder
Maurice R. Robinson, own approximately 95% of those shares.
   The company said holders of common stock will be entitled
to elect one-fifth of the company's board, which now has 12
members.
   Scholastic hasn't paid dividends since 1986, and has no
current plans to pay dividends on its common or Class A stock
in the future, the company says.
   Scholastic, formerly known as SI Holdings Inc., was a
publicly traded company until 1987, when a group led by
management acquired the company for about $84 million in cash
and securities. After the offering, current shareholders will
control 67.3% of the company, which they acquired at an
average cost of $1.35 a share. The company's new investors
will own 32.7% of the company's shares, acquired at an
average estimated price of $19.50.
   For the year ended May 31, Scholastic reported net income
of $2.3 million, compared with a loss of $4.8 million the
previous year. Revenue was $374.6 million, up from $299.6
million.
   Scholastic will apply to have its common stock included in
the National Market System of the over-the-counter market,
under the symbol SCHL.
