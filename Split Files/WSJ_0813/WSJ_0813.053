   THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- Dutch consumer prices rose
0.3% in the month to mid-July and were up 2.3% from a year
earlier, the Netherlands Economics Ministry reported.
   The upturn in July reflected mainly higher rent increases
that are imposed annually in that month, the provisional data
disclosed.
