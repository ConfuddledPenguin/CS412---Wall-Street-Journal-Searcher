   The chief executives at two large and troubled thrifts in
Puerto Rico resigned Friday.
   In Ponce, Ramiro L. Colon Jr. stepped down as president
and chief executive officer of Ponce Federal Bank. Mr. Colon,
who has been affiliated with the thrift for over 30 years,
will continue as chairman of the board during an interim
management transition period, the thrift said.

   Ponce Federal said that, subject to regulatory approval,
Hans H. Hertell, an attorney in Puerto Rico and
public-interest director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York, was named its president and chief operating officer to
succeed Mr. Colon.
   Separately, Mariano J. Mier resigned as chairman,
president and chief executive officer of First Federal
Savings Bank of Puerto Rico, based in San Juan, the thrift
said.
   First Federal said in a statement that Angel Alvarez Perez
was named acting president and chief executive and German
Malaret was named as the new chairman. Officials at First
Federal Savings couldn't be reached to comment on the
executive changes.
   Two other top officers at First Federal also resigned last
week: Arturo J. Somohano, former senior executive vice
president and chief operating officer, and Fernando Ochoa,
former senior vice president for investments.
   Both thrifts have been under the close scrutiny of federal
thrift regulators because of troubled loan portfolios.
