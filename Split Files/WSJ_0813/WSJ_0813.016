   HAIPHONG, Vietnam -- Inspired by the presence of a foreign
visitor, Thanh Tung calls for silence and spontaneously
composes a poem.
   As the room goes quiet, he delivers his creation fluently,
pausing only to let an interpreter render each line into
English. A sample couplet:

   All the bitter things in my life
   Are something precious to me
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Tung's colleagues, listening attentively, nod in
approval. When he finishes, they applaud warmly. Someone
pours another round of drinks and cracks a joke, and the
place erupts in laughter and conversation.
   Welcome to the Literature Cafe, not the sort of place
usually associated with Vietnam, but a sign of the times
nevertheless.
   With the Communist Party relaxing its once-stifling grip
on everyday life, patterns of social activity are changing.
The cafe caters to something of a national passion for
literature -- it's often said that every Vietnamese is a poet
-- and an ancient salon tradition in which followers of the
arts met to discuss their work, exchange views and gossip.
The most prestigious salons were poetry-reciting groups
called "tao dan."
   The salons disappeared from what was then North Vietnam in
the early 1960s after the government jailed leaders of a
progressive literary movement when they started criticizing
corruption and collectivization and demanded more artistic
freedom. Intellectuals dared not meet in public any longer
because they feared informers and worried that their
freewheeling talk could be construed as anti-party.
   A visitor is surprised to find the Literature Cafe
thriving in industrial Haiphong, a major port and coal
transshipment center 100 kilometers east of Hanoi. Not
surprising at all, say locals, who insist that Haiphong is
"the cradle of Vietnamese culture" -- undeterred by the fact
that similar claims are made for other areas of the country.
   The cafe was opened on a street near the city's main
market in January by Le Viet Hung, a 41-year-old literature
teacher, who sees it as a gathering place for "writers, poets
and poor people."
   It is run by the chain-smoking, ever-smiling Mr. Tung, 55,
Haiphong's leading poet, who describes himself as "manager
and soul of the cafe." An engaging man with a light mustache,
chin stubble and long straggly hair that can't hide a bald
pate, he's on hand every day to share a drink with customers.
   Mr. Tung is helped by Thu Hien, a well-known classical
singer, and five other women, mostly daughters of
intellectuals. Mr. Hung jokes that he pays Mr. Tung and the
women "by sentiment," though they do, in reality, draw basic
salaries. The real reason they have joined the venture,
though, is that they are all friends.
   The cafe itself is modest, little more than a square
concrete room, with tables made from cross-sections of tree
trunks, thick and gnarled. The seats are the usual tiny
Vietnamese stools on which occupants squat a few centimeters
from the floor.
   The walls are fairly bare, the main decoration being pure
kitsch: A clock set in a framed print of a beautiful young
woman who sits, demure and topless, with arms forward playing
a flute and protecting her modesty. The second hand moving
around the dial has a colored plastic butterfly attached to
it.
   On sale, apart from light meals, are beer, liquor, soft
drinks, tea, coffee, cigarettes and a few other odds and
ends. But what is in greatest demand is free: good
old-fashioned fun, a scarce commodity across decades of cruel
war and grim dictatorship in Vietnam.
   Drop in at the Literature Cafe unannounced on a Sunday
morning and catch a rare glimpse of a somewhat different
slice of Vietnamese life.
   Le Dai Thanh, 84, the elder statesman among the regulars,
looks as if he has just stepped out of the Left Bank in
Paris. He's dressed in dark slacks, a colored shirt and tie
that don't match, a soiled jacket and worn, two-tone blue
sneakers. Long dark hair trails from beneath a dusty brown
felt hat, and he wears heavy, dark-rimmed spectacles.
   "I'm a king of French language," he declares in the
jocular, boastful style common in the group. "I can compose
poems in French." Actually, Mr. Thanh says, he has taught
himself five foreign languages and is now learning German. To
prove his proficiency in English to a visitor, he inscribes a
dog-eared volume of his Vietnamese-language poetry that was
published in 1987.
   Mr. Thanh is a walking history book. Back in French
colonial days, he attended Haiphong's famous Ngo Quyen
school, where former premier Pham Van Dong was a classmate.
Mr. Thanh remembers the day security police arrived to arrest
a younger student, Nguyen Van Linh, who now leads the nation
as general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party.
   Today, Mr. Thanh has other things on his mind. "This is a
good omen," he says as he accepts an imported cigarette. "It
will inspire my poem." He retires to a corner to write and
ignores everyone and everything for the next couple of hours.
