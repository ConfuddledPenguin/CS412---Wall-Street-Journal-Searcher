   RALEIGH, N.C. -- Following public outcry about the huge
run-up in gasoline prices, the state attorney general filed
suit against Exxon Corp., alleging deceptive trade practices.
   While a number of states have said they would pursue
investigations into allegations of price-gouging and
profiteering by major oil companies after the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, it is believed this is the first suit following
the big gasoline price increases.

   North Carolina charged that Exxon raised its wholesale
gasoline prices to distributors by as much as six cents a
gallon after contracting to sell that gasoline at a lower
price. In some cases, the state alleges, distributors had
made deliveries to service stations before learning of the
increase in prices.
   An Exxon spokesman in Houston declined to comment on the
suit.
