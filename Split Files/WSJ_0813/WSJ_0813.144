   WELLESLEY, Mass. -- EG&amp;G Inc. said it agreed to sell its
Fluid Components Technology Group to TI Group PLC of the
United Kingdom for $240 million.
   TI Group approached EG&amp;G about three months ago with a
first offer for the fluid components division, said an EG&amp;G
representative. Last month, Nok Corp. of Japan -- a longtime
partner of EG&amp;G's in aerospace and foreign ventures,
exercised its right to make a counter offer of $210 million.
EG&amp;G said it had terminated negotiations with Nok when TI
Group bettered that bid and "will proceed toward a year-end
closing" of the transaction.

   TI Group expects to finance the purchase of the unit,
which had 1989 revenue of $180 million, from its "own cash
resources and existing credit facilities," EG&amp;G said. The
sale to TI Group is subject to a definitive contract and
regulatory approval, EG&amp;G added.
   "We've wanted to put more capital into areas of our
commerical business, but we had not specifically put anything
up for sale," said EG&amp;G spokeswoman Deborah Lorenz, in
explaining why this particular division was sold. "We got a
good offer for fluid components. So we decided it would be
the one."
   The fluid components unit's largest client is the
aerospace industry, for which it makes aircraft sealings and
metal pieces for engines. The unit, which also makes seals
for fluid control systems, amounts to just under 10% of
EG&amp;G's total revenue, which totaled $1.65 billion in 1989.
   While most of EG&amp;G's business, about 65%, is for the
Energy and Defense departments, Ms. Lorenz noted "that we
don't have control over the granting of government contracts.
The area we do have control over is our commercial side,
everything from airport and industrial security to scientific
measuring equipment to components for optical and electronic
devices, all of which this sale will enable us to bolster."
