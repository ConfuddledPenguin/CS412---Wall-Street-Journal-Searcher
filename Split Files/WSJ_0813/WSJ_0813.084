   ROME -- Italy's unadjusted index of industrial production
fell 3.6% in June from a year earlier, the State Statistical
Institute Istat said.
   Istat said the index (1985 equals 100) registered 125.2 in
June, compared with 129.9 in June 1989.

   The drop was partly due to fewer working days in June of
this year. The index was based on 21 working days; while June
1989 counted 22 working days.
   The drop, which followed a year-on-year rise of 0.7% in
May, confirms a downard trend in economic activity in recent
months. Taking into account the difference in number of
working days, the average daily industrial production edged
up 0.1%, Istat said.
