   When Paramount Pictures signed its exclusive five-picture
contract with Eddie Murphy in 1983, it agreed to pay the star
comedian a then-astonishing $3 million per movie -- quite a
nice raise from the $200,000 it gave him for his first hit,
"48 Hours."
   He was "ecstatic," Mr. Murphy recalled in a recent court
deposition. "I thought I was the king of the hill." Paramount
has renegotiated his contract three times since then. It now
is obligated to pay him $9 million per movie up front against
a guaranteed 15% of each picture's gross revenue -- and for
his most recent film, "Another 48 Hours," he reportedly was
paid about $12 million up front.

   But the 29-year-old doesn't feel so ecstatic or rich
anymore. Mr. Murphy now is believed to want between $15
million and $18 million per movie up front. He is mighty
steamed at reports that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold
Schwarzenegger are commanding up to $20 million. And he is
upset that many of what he considers Hollywood's best acting
roles and hottest scripts aren't being offered to him or
developed for him by Paramount.
   Thus while the exclusive contract that ties Mr. Murphy to
Paramount doesn't expire until he completes two more films,
the battle for Mr. Murphy's future services is already on. It
is one that could spark a new round of inflation in
Hollywood, where many say costs have already gotten out of
control. Studios like Walt Disney Co. are circling like
buzzards around Mr. Murphy, most claiming privately that
Paramount has mishandled its star property.
   For Paramount, the stakes are high. Its relationship with
Mr. Murphy has, on the whole, been the most lucrative in
modern Hollywood history, bringing in more than $1 billion in
revenue world-wide since 1982 for the subsidiary of Paramount
Communications Inc. The studio has come under attack in
Hollywood recently for focusing too heavily on marketing and
not enough on creative development, and losing one of its
major assets could be a further blow to its image.
   But Mr. Murphy's movies are increasingly costly to make,
his entourage increasingly more demanding and expensive, and
his managers, according to Paramount insiders, more
obstructionist and uncooperative. His 1989 movie "Harlem
Nights," which Mr. Murphy insisted on making against the
studio's advice, is likely to break even at best for
Paramount.
   Mark Manson, an entertainment-industry analyst at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., says that an Eddie Murphy
movie "may be a guarantee of revenue, but it is not a
guarantee of profit."
   Internal Paramount documents and depositions taken during
the "Coming to America" trial, in which syndicated columnist
Art Buchwald has sued Paramount over profits from that film,
show how tough it is to manage the megastar.
   In his deposition in that case, for example, Mr. Murphy
described his Paramount deal with an expletive and dubbed it
the "worst" in Hollywood, even though one of his managers
admitted in court testimony that the contract is probably
"one of the best deals in town."
   Mr. Murphy's Paramount deal is virtually the only such
large-scale, exclusive arrangement in town. Many big stars,
such as Messrs. Stallone and Schwarzenegger, are themselves
forgoing exclusive deals in order to sell their latest
projects to the highest bidder.
   On the other hand, a deal with one studio can be
comforting, particularly to someone like Mr. Murphy, who
likes to maintain a very large staff when he's shooting --
and even when he's not.
   Paramount houses Mr. Murphy's companies in one of the
choicest buildings on its lot and pays his considerable
overhead, including the year-round salaries of the 50-plus
employees of Mr. Murphy's movie and television companies.
While shooting "Coming to America," Paramount spent an
additional $600,000 or so on the salaries and living expenses
of a half-dozen relatives and cronies, a valet, a personal
trainer, a 24-hour limousine and driver, and a luxury
motorhome and driver for Mr. Murphy, not to mention such
sundry items as a $235.33 tab at McDonald's.
   A lucrative, multiple-picture deal also might be
reassuring to someone whose latest projects have come in for
some nasty notices from critics and haven't performed as well
at the box office as some previous efforts.
   "Like many superstars, Eddie Murphy may have gotten so
tangled up in the myths and myopia of high-power movie-making
that he can't get back to the gritty, pungent,
kick-in-the-throat awareness earlier audiences loved," said a
scathing review of "Harlem Nights" in the Los Angeles Times.
Mr. Murphy hasn't fared much better in his latest effort;
Newsweek dismissed "Another 48 Hours" as "atrocious" and Time
magazine declared him "the late great Eddie Murphy . . . now
missing and presumed dead."
   Regardless of the reviews, virtually every other studio in
Hollywood would like to sign Mr. Murphy up. One of those is
Disney and its chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who as an executive
at Paramount in the early 1980s helped oversee Mr. Murphy's
early meteoric rise, and who has been unofficially wooing the
star ever since joining Disney in 1984. Personal friends, the
two frequently dine or play tennis and discuss Mr. Murphy's
career. Mr. Katzenberg declines to comment, but Hollywood
agents say Disney is quietly developing about 10 scripts with
Mr. Murphy in mind.
   Another prime suitor is Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.
subsidiary. Warner has formed a company with Murphy pal
Quincy Jones, who flew the actor on one of Warner's planes to
the company's Acapulco beach house recently.
   Paramount has said it will take immediate legal action if
any rivals formally approach Mr. Murphy now. The star's
managers stress that no negotiations can begin until 30 days
after Mr. Murphy completes two more movies, which could be a
year or more away.
   "Eddie will end up going to the studio that makes him the
best offer," says co-manager Mark Lipsky. "Paramount has
treated him well and we hope Paramount will be in the ball
game." Mr. Murphy declined to be interviewed, saying only, "I
have two films remaining on my contract with Paramount. When
I have completed my work, I will fully examine my options."
   Paramount's only comment: "The company has had a long and
successful collaboration with Mr. Murphy and would like to
extend it under mutually beneficial terms." Paramount this
month rehired David Kirkpatrick, who worked closely with Mr.
Murphy before leaving the studio in 1985, and was most
recently at Disney. Insiders say in recent years there has
been no operating executive with close ties to the Murphy
camp.
   Controlling virtually every aspect of Mr. Murphy's
business life, including screening all movie projects before
they are shown to the star, is contentious attorney Robert
Wachs. Mr. Wachs, who helped give Mr. Murphy his big break at
Mr. Wachs's part-owned Comic Strip club in New York several
years ago, and co-manager Mr. Lipsky each get 5% of Mr.
Murphy's earnings and each own 25% of Eddie Murphy
Productions; the actor owns 50%. Mr. Wachs also manages talk
show host Arsenio Hall, a friend of Mr. Murphy's, but Mr.
Hall is negotiating to cut most of his ties with Mr. Wachs.
   Mr. Wachs, who declined to comment for this article,
admitted in his "Coming to America" court testimony that he
often immediately rejects things that are submitted after a
quick glance. He said in his "Coming to America" deposition
that he gets hundreds of movie ideas and often gives a
"cursory `no we're not interested'" without explaining why.
   Some of these indeed seem to need no explanation,
including scripts such as "Cyrano de Boogie," "Black
Musketeer," "A Black Yankee at the Court of Queen Liz," and
"Count Cool and The Knights of the Round Table."
   In fact, Messrs. Wachs's and Murphy's biggest complaint is
that Paramount isn't bringing Mr. Murphy the kind of
imaginative scripts he deserves. "I've pretty much had to
develop my own stuff the last three, four years," Mr. Murphy
has testified.
   International Creative Management recently signed a new
agreement with Mr. Murphy that lasts only until his current
deal with Paramount ends. Mr. Wachs is equally displeased
with the efforts of Mr. Murphy's agents at ICM, who Mr. Wachs
testified "just ride the wave" of Mr. Murphy's success
without bringing him creative ideas.
   Mr. Wachs testified, for example, that neither ICM nor
Paramount initially thought of Mr. Murphy for "The Golden
Child," a script ICM sold to a producer, who brought it to
Paramount with Mel Gibson in mind. ICM declined to comment.
Mr. Wachs said he heard about the script one night when he
was telling Mr. Kirkpatrick the kind of movie Eddie wanted to
do next. "He told me they had a movie like that but they had
never thought about it for us," Mr. Wachs said in his
deposition.
   Mr. Murphy immediately agreed to do the movie, about a
social worker hired to locate a Tibetan child with magical
powers who has been kidnapped by an evil modern-day sorcerer,
which sold about $80 million in tickets in the U.S., and cost
about $30.2 million to produce.
   Paramount executives argue that they always have 20 to 30
projects for Mr. Murphy in development at any one time. And
some Paramount insiders and others contend that neither Mr.
Wachs nor Mr. Murphy have proved a hotbed of creativity or
good judgment lately.
   Mr. Murphy is said to be furious that he wasn't shown the
script for the hit Paramount movie "Ghost," starring Patrick
Swayze. But people familiar with the script say it was given
to Mr. Wachs and others in the Murphy camp who rejected it.
   Mr. Murphy recently hired his own development executive,
but by his own admission the actor often loses interest in
projects or lets them simmer for years. One idea of his own
he's been toying with on and off for about five years is
"Satan's Key," an idea that he said came to him after reading
Dante's Inferno. His description of that idea, contained in
his deposition, didn't exactly reflect five years of
development: "In a nutshell, guy dies, goes to hell, and
tries to escape."
   And the star's detractors say he has surrounded himself
with a coterie of yes-men, buddies and family members who
rarely try to persuade him to do something he or Mr. Wachs
isn't immediately enthusiastic about.
   Tensions between Paramount and the Murphy camp have
escalated recently over "Another 48 Hours." Although it
opened to a respectable $19.4 million, the Murphy camp
accused Paramount of not spending enough on advertising and
hurting the movie by changing its release date. In response
to a letter from a Paramount executive defending the
company's promotion campaign and noting that the star did
little to promote the movie, Mr. Murphy shot back a withering
letter telling the executive in essence what he could do with
his missive.
   This follows the tensions created by "Coming to America,"
which cast an embarrassing spotlight on the Paramount-Murphy
relationship and led some to conclude it won't survive, at
least in its present form. In January, a Los Angeles Superior
Court ruled that the columnist Mr. Buchwald had provided the
story idea for "Coming to America" and was therefore entitled
to be paid part of the proceeds. The second stage of the
trial, due to begin soon, will determine how much, if
anything, Paramount must pay Mr. Buchwald.
   But as long as Mr. Murphy and Mr. Wachs stay together, it
isn't clear that a close relationship with another major
studio is in the offing. Mr. Wachs seems determined to
maintain his complete control over Mr. Murphy's movie career
and may resist the activist approach taken by the likes of
Disney's Mr. Katzenberg, who has helped resuscitate the
careers of stars Bette Midler and Richard Dreyfus. In his
court deposition, Mr. Wachs said he had a problem with Mr.
Katzenberg in his Paramount days "when he tried to manage
Eddie instead of me."
   Meanwhile, the search for Eddie Murphy material goes on at
Paramount. One possible script is "Fountain of Youth" about
two old con men who grow younger. But an on-again, off-again
"Beverly Hills Cop III" appears to be permanently off, in
part because it would cost too much, and because no one has
been able to come up with a good script. And Mr. Murphy also
has said he doesn't want to be pigeonholed as the Axel Foley
character from "Cop."
   Under Mr. Murphy's agreement with Paramount, another "Cop"
wouldn't even count as one of the two more movies he is
obligated to do under his contract. Although the newly
returned Mr. Kirkpatrick is hard at work on projects for the
actor, and has been squiring Mr. Murphy around to meet with
some of Hollywood's hottest directors and writers, there's
nothing firm on the horizon. While praising Mr. Kirkpatrick's
recent efforts, Mr. Lipsky, the star's co-manager, says,
"We're all looking, but to date we just haven't found
anything that Eddie's excited about."
