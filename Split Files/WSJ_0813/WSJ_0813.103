   MILWAUKEE -- Badger Meter Inc. said it scheduled a special
shareholders meeting for Sept. 18 to vote on a proposal to
allow seven corporate officers to become holders of the
company's Class B shares, which have so-called super-voting
rights.
   Until now, only existing Class B holders could buy Class B
shares as they became available. The maker of flow
measurement products, which has about 562,785 B shares
outstanding, said the proposal doesn't involve the issuance
of new B shares.

   The B shares have 10 votes a share vs. one vote for
regular common.
   The proposal, the company said, is aimed at increasing its
ability to "attract and retain high quality officers." The
proposal covers only the top seven officers.
