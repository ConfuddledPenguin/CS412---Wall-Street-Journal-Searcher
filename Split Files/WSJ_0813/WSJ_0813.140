   NEW YORK -- The hot market for new issues has suddenly
cooled.
   As tensions in the Middle East shook the financial
markets, investment bankers postponed 13 out of 15 initial
public stock offerings planned for last week, according to a
tally by Investment Dealers Digest, a trade publication.

   Many underwriters say they will try to creep back this
week if stock prices remain stable, but they agree the
euphoria that bathed the IPO market this summer isn't likely
to return soon.
   If last week's lone new stock offering is an example, IPO
prices will fall and companies won't be willing to sell as
much stock as they had been to the public. Volatile stock
prices also may drive both short-term investors and marginal
companies from the IPO market, analysts say.
   "It's an extraordinarily fragile market," says Kenneth
Fitzsimmons, head of the syndicate department at Robertson,
Stephens &amp; Co., San Francisco, which last week underwrote an
initial offering of Easel Corp. at a lower price than
planned.
   Surging oil prices have sparked concern about a recession
and higher inflation in the U.S. In uncertain times,
investors are particularly wary of infant companies that may
be vulnerable to economic upheavals. Recently, analysts add,
companies with relatively weak finances, lured by rising IPO
prices, have been testing the public market.
   "In the past few weeks, you've seen some issues being
filed that have no business coming to the market," says Mark
Basham, a new-issues analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The
recent plunge in stock prices will weed out many of those
companies, he predicts.
   Falling stocks prices also will damp demand for new
offerings by investors expecting quick profits from sharply
rising new shares, says Alan Radlo, portfolio manager of the
$734 million Fidelity OTC Fund. "This market will start
separating the long-term investors from the people who throw
money at the markets," he says.
   Whether companies go through with planned offerings at
their hoped-for prices will depend on how events in the
Middle East unfold, says Mr. Fitzsimmons of Robertson
Stephens. "It's really out of our control."
   By one investment banker's estimate, potential offering
prices for proposed new issues fell 15% last week. If the
stock market remains at current levels, fully onethird of all
new and secondary offerings planned for this year could
vanish, predicts David Weild, director of the equity
syndicate department at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   On the other hand, he adds, if the stock market rebounds,
many of those offerings could still be completed. "There are
still a lot of people out there with cash" to spend on new
issues, he says. "You could still see 20 deals a week, even
with a market correction."
   Initial offerings were humming before they came to a
standstill last week. Through the end of July, there were 152
new offerings at $1 a share or more this year, with a total
of more than $8 billion, according to IDD Information
Services. This year had been the best for new offerings since
the 1987 stock-market crash; July set a record with 29 IPOs.
   Despite the current stock-market plunge, investment
bankers remain plucky  -- at least about their intentions.
Underwriters of 11 IPOs scheduled for last week have said
they plan to come back to the market this week, according to
Frank Santos, managing editor of Eliot Sharp's Financing
News, an IDD newsletter that tracks new issues.
   Mr. Santos, however, says that even if this week's stock
market finds some sturdy ground, he expects only half of
those will actually go public. Even that half will probably
trade at the low end of their estimated price ranges, he
adds. "The market's just too shaky," he says.
   Some of this year's busiest syndicate directors also
expect a slowdown. "In a market where there's considerable
unrest, I don't think you can ask buyers to step up to the
plate," says Alexander Daignault, head of the equity
syndicate department at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc., Baltimore,
which ranks among this year's top underwriters.
   Should uncertainty continue to rattle the markets, some
underwriters say they may be forced to use creative marketing
techniques to sell IPOs. Mr. Daignault says one way
underwriters could successfully sell an offering in these
conditions is to market it as a "quasi-private placement,"
targeting it to a small group of buyers.
   That's similar to what Robertson Stephens did when it
underwrote the Easel offering last week. The brokerage
company, which was the first underwriter to bring a company
public after the 1987 crash, managed to sell a 1.6
million-share offering Thursday by Easel, a software product
concern, at $8 a share.
   The secret to selling the Easel offering, Mr. Fitzsimmons
says, was cutting the price of the issue and targeting it to
a small group of long-term institutional investors. Robertson
Stephens shaved the price to $8 a share from an expected $9
to $11 a share. Easel also reduced the size of the offering,
which was oversubscribed, to 1.6 million shares from an
originally planned 1,850,000 shares.
   More than 100 buyers originally subscribed to the
offering. After the market plunged, if the original buyers
"didn't call to cancel, we assumed they canceled," Mr.
Fitzsimmons explains. The underwriters then found 30
institutional buyers who were seasoned investors in emerging
growth companies. "They tried to select people who weren't
going to flip the stock quickly," says John McDonough, chief
financial officer at Easel.
   Instead of giving members of the syndicate stock to sell,
Robertson Stephens completely controlled the allocation of
the stock, allowing the company to keep a close eye on how
the shares were distributed. By limiting distribution and
selecting buyers that were unlikely to sell out of the stock
once it started trading, Robertson Stephens was able to
reduce the chances of the stock plunging in the secondary
market. Easel closed Friday at 8 5/8.
   "That's one way and a good way to do a deal in this kind
of environment," says Mr. Daignault of Alex. Brown, which had
been expected to price initial public offerings by Black Box
Inc., Crescent Jewelers Inc. and Gerrity Oil &amp; Gas Corp. last
week.
   Gerrity Oil &amp; Gas is now targeted for pricing today, with
Crescent slated to come to market later in the week. Black
Box shares won't be offered until late this month, syndicate
officials say.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The over-the-counter market fell as investors and traders
sold shares amid concerns that tensions in the Middle East
might flare up over the weekend.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.95 points, to 408.03, a
1.2% slide, as volume eased to 112 million shares from 129.9
million shares Thursday. Declining shares overtook advancers,
1,248 to 722.
   Sun Microsystems added 1 1/4 to 31. Late Thursday, the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of computer workstations
exceeded analysts' expectations with fiscal fourthquarter net
income of 51 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss
of 25 cents a share.
   Exabyte dropped 3 7/8 to 12 3/8. The Boulder, Colo., maker
of cartridge-tape systems said it expects its net income for
the third quarter ending Sept. 30 to fall below the 38 cents
a share earned in the second quarter. The company earned 17
cents a share in the third quarter a year earlier.
   Shares of office supply "superstores" fell after Salomon
Brothers cut its earnings estimates for Office Club, one of
the leaders in the young industry, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Office Club dropped 1 1/2 to
12.
   Staples, another warehouse-style retailer of office
products, eased 1/2 to 18 3/4. Meanwhile, BizMart fell 1/2 to
11 1/8. The stock remains above its recent lows, however,
which it hit at the end of July when the company said it
would post a loss in its latest fiscal first quarter. The
company made the announcement just days after completing a
2,750,000-share offering of its stock at $15.75 a share.
