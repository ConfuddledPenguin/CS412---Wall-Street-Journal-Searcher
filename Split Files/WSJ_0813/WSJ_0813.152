   LONDON -- Nearly 40 years ago, Britain's most flamboyant
politician, then an undergraduate at Oxford University, made
a flamboyant resolution. On the back of an envelope, Michael
Heseltine charted his life plan, noting what he intended to
do during each decade.
   Next to the 1990s, Mr. Heseltine wrote "Downing Street."

   The 1990s are upon us, and many in Britain wonder whether
Mr. Heseltine's time has come. Now 57 years old, the former
Conservative defense secretary has been running a virtual
U.S.-style presidential campaign since he stormed out of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet four years ago in
a disagreement over her leadership.
   Though he professes he won't ever challenge Mrs. Thatcher
directly, he travels the country espousing alternatives to
her policies. He pops up regularly on radio and television,
and he is writing his third book on politics since his
resignation. No one here doubts that he wants to be prime
minister, and opinion polls peg him as the front-runner to
succeed Mrs. Thatcher.
   So who is Michael Heseltine? He is, in some ways, much
like Mrs. Thatcher herself: a strong leader with a clear view
of the world and of Britain's role in it, and formidable
energy to put his ideas in place. "They are both conviction
leaders, which we don't often have in British politics," says
Vernon Bogdanor, a political scientist at Oxford.
   But a Prime Minister Heseltine would differ profoundly
from Mrs. Thatcher in some major respects. Under him, Britain
-- long torn between the U.S. and Europe -- would set its
sights firmly on the latter. Mr. Heseltine would be an eager
European Community leader, in sharp contrast to Mrs.
Thatcher's often grudging attitude. "Once we enter into that
debate" on Europe, he warns in an interview, "we better be at
the leading edge of it."
   Mr. Heseltine is, in fact, the most colorful foe of the
Conservative Party's anti-Europe wing. The alternative he
presents was thrown into even sharper relief by the recent
political exit of Nicholas Ridley, who resigned the post of
trade secretary after an interview in which he said
surrendering sovereignty to the EC was like giving it "to
Adolf Hitler." Although Mrs. Thatcher hastened to distance
herself from Mr. Ridley's remarks, the episode resurrected
embarrassing questions about the prime minister's commitment
to Europe.
   At home, Mr. Heseltine would soften the strict free-market
ethos of the Thatcher era, promoting greater cooperation
between government and industry and reweaving a bit of the
social safety net. "He is going to broaden the appeal of
conservatism from being not just concerned with the creation
of wealth, but how you use it," says Keith Hampson, a fellow
Conservative member of Parliament.
   His critics -- and there are plenty of them -- consider
him too rash to be a good leader, citing episodes from his
long and colorful political career. Some dislike the prospect
of a shift away from Thatcherism. "He'd be inclined to
compromise far more than Mrs. Thatcher," says Sir Marcus Fox,
a senior back-bench Conservative MP. "We wouldn't get the
same style of leadership. That is not a prospect I welcome."
   A tall man with a thick mane of blond hair, Mr. Heseltine
undoubtedly is a politician of grand gestures. He is
restless, churning out opinions on everything from European
defense to rural development in England. "Spitting Image,"
British television's satirical puppet show, portrays him as
"Blond Man" -- a sort of Batman clone, complete with cape.
   He is a renowned entrepreneur and a self-made millionaire.
The son of a middle-class businessman, he grew up in Swansea
in south Wales. Founder and controlling shareholder of
Haymarket Publishing Group, he now ranks among Britain's
richest citizens, with an estimated worth of #50 million ($93
million). He has a house in London's tony Belgravia district
and a country mansion in Northamptonshire.
   Mr. Heseltine stopped running privately held Haymarket,
which publishes trade magazines, in 1970. But his approach to
politics remains businesslike. David Edmonds, a former civil
servant who worked for Mr. Heseltine at the U.K. Environment
Department between 1979 and 1983, recalls the ex-cabinet
secretary running his ministry like a company. For Britain's
"mandarins," or nonpolitical bureaucrats, it was quite a
shock.
   "We rapidly learned he had some very clear objectives,"
Mr. Edmonds says. "He had a reputation for being a
dilettante, but in fact he worked extremely hard."
   Mildly dyslexic, Mr. Heseltine had his staff prepare
one-page briefing memos for him. His reliance on such
support, combined with his wealth and well-cut suits, gave
him a reputation as an intellectual lightweight in some
political circles.
   However, Mr. Edmonds argues, "he does not lack intellect
-- quite the opposite. He has a great ability to absorb
material, mainly by listening to people." Policy was hammered
out, Mr. Edmonds adds, "in meetings which would sometimes go
on for two, three or four hours. What he likes is a clear
object, and then targets to measure success against."
   Nowadays, Mr. Heseltine stresses his credentials as a
businessman when discussing such issues as Britain's role in
Europe. Long an advocate of full membership in the European
Monetary System, he pointedly argues that Britain's inflation
rate wouldn't be nearly 10% if the country had previously
entered fully into the currency arrangement.
   Business decisions, he says, "need to be made against the
confidence of economic stability. Industrialists don't want
to try to double-guess exchange rates. They don't want to
have to calculate their bills in 12 different currencies all
the time."
   While Mrs. Thatcher likes to hold Britain up as an example
of free-market excellence, Mr. Heseltine speaks of what
Britain can learn from others. Currently writing a book about
Japan, he sees many lessons there. "At every stage where
there is an input into their competitive ability, they've
pursued excellence," he says. "Everywhere you look, they are
pushing, pushing, pushing. That's why they're such a
formidable competitor."
   While advocating strong ties to Europe, Mr. Heseltine also
takes worries about national sovereignty seriously; he is too
shrewd a politician to ignore the uneasiness felt by many
British voters. To that end, he likens the EC not to a United
States of Europe but to a club. "There are rules," he
explains. "There are privileges. You are free to join. If you
are a member of it and you want to influence the rules, you'd
better get on the committee."
   Like many of Mr. Heseltine's ideas, his pronouncements on
Europe are short on detail. But leaning back in his chair,
feet propped on his desk, he quotes no less than Winston
Churchill in support: "In these brave endeavors, it is better
to proceed at a pace that is possible for you, and leave to
others the resolution of matters that you yourself cannot
address. They will do so in their own context, against their
own expectations and experiences."
   Mr. Heseltine adds: "That is a very sophisticated way of
looking at it. We must proceed only at a point at which the
nation will accept."
