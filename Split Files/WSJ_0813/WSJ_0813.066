   TACOMA, Wash. -- Hillhaven Corp. said it will purchase for
$20.8 million six nursing centers in Kentucky that it
currently operates under leasing agreements.
   The transaction will be financed through an offering of
asset-backed commercial paper, a company spokesman said. The
transaction is subject to governmental and other approvals
and is expected to close before Oct. 31. The nursing centers
to be acquired have 800 beds, and the company reports a 98%
occupancy rate.
