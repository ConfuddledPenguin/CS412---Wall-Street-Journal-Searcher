   New York -- Andreas Holschneider, the president of
Deutsche Grammophon, must be gnashing his teeth over Trevor
Pinnock's resignation as music director of the Classical
Band. In April 1989, DG had signed a six-year contract with
the British conductor and harpsichordist for 18 recordings
with his new, 50-member period-instruments orchestra, the
first of its size in the U.S. It was a surprisingly juicy
deal for a group that had yet to play a single note.
   Now, Mr. Pinnock has departed, the Band's first recording
session has been canceled and the German company is in the
process of deciding whether to pull out or to record the
ensemble with another conductor. To complicate matters, Sony
Classical, DG's rival and chief raider of late, is about to
sign up the Band for at least 10 recordings with the German
conductor Bruno Weil, whose guest performance last February
at Carnegie Hall was somewhat better received than Mr.
Pinnock's efforts.

   Officially, Mr. Pinnock left because of legitimate
concerns about the Band's continued financial viability;
funds are still being sought for its coming Avery Fisher Hall
series here. But it's no secret that the 43-year-old
conductor was disheartened by the negative reviews of his
Band's inaugural season and disgruntled over the way his
manager, Liviu Blumenthal, the Band's executive director, had
handled some of its affairs.
   Meanwhile Mr. Weil was just named principal guest
conductor, despite his limited experience with
period-instrument ensembles. The promise of a recording
contract apparently means more than appropriate artistic
credentials these days.
   What does all this say about the current status of the
historical-performance movement, which attempts to re-create
musical compositions using the instruments and stylistic
conventions of their time? During the 1980s, British
ensembles such as Christopher Hogwood's Academy of Ancient
Music, Mr. Pinnock's English Concert and Roger Norrington's
London Classical Players came to international prominence by
playing ear-opening performances of baroque and classical
masterpieces on plain gut strings, wooden flutes, valveless
horns, fortepianos and other antique instruments. They
changed our notions of how this music should be played.
   As a result, symphony orchestras now program fewer works
by Bach, Handel and Vivaldi and routinely reduce their
100-member forces for Haydn or Mozart. Mainstream conductors
such as Simon Rattle, Charles Mackerras and David Zinman are
among those who have incorporated the stylistic traits of
historical performance into their music-making.
   At the same time, the early-music specialists have
parlayed their successes into guest-conducting stints with
the likes of the Metropolitan Opera, the Berlin Philharmonic
and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. And classical-record
companies have had a bonanza rerecording their catalogs with
a new crop of best-selling maestros. This has been especially
true since Mr. Norrington spearheaded the move into the
19th-century repertoire, tackling Schubert, Berlioz and
Wagner.
   But now that we've all passed the aural seduction stage,
the whole notion of authenticity is being examined more
closely. In an essay for the New York Review of Books, the
pianist-scholar Charles Rosen notes the perils of asking not
"what the composer wanted, but only what he got." In a recent
New York Times piece, musicologist Richard Taruskin cites
ways in which historical specialists "pick and choose" the
performance practices they wish to follow, carefully
duplicating the original instruments, for example, but
ignoring the 18th-century habit of improvisation.
   In an interview last summer, Charles Dutoit, music
director of the Montreal Symphony, argued that
period-instrument groups "are using microphones to record
their performances which enable them to sound fuller. And I
question whether they're all using plain gut strings when
they play Berlioz. They've created the image of something
new, but there's much marketing behind that."
   Which brings us back to the founding of the Classical
Band. With the London scene growing increasingly overcrowded,
the enterprising Britons turned their eyes to American
shores. In 1986, Mr. Hogwood revitalized the 175-year-old
Handel &amp; Haydn Society of Boston, turning it into a 35-member
period-instrument group. Mr. Pinnock had bigger ideas. In
1989, he founded the Classical Band with $150,000 in funds
from Bristol-Myers and the DG contract in hand.
   Unfortunately, he peopled the Band with a curious mixture
of crack early-music specialists and conventional violinists
who had never played on gut strings. At its Columbia
University "preview," to which the press was unwisely
invited, the conventional fiddlers simply removed their chin
rests and restrung their modernized 18thor 19th-century
fiddles with gut -- which smacks of deceptive packaging. And
their inexperience showed in the poor string tone and lack of
ensemble.
   This was followed by a disappointing inaugural season in
the full glare of critical scrutiny at Carnegie Hall. A less
glamorous venue was deemed inappropriate for someone of Mr.
Pinnock's stature and, no doubt, less appealing to potential
donors. In short, something that could have been a boon for
American period-instrument musicians and concertgoers alike
got off to a horrendously bad start.
   The Band's recent performance under Mr. Weil at the Mostly
Mozart Festival was again plagued by raggedness in the
violins. But on the whole the playing was the most polished
I've heard from the group in the three concerts I've
attended. Mr. Weil's buoyant, fluid reading of Schubert's
Fifth came off best, with particularly impressive
contributions from flutists Christopher Kreuger and Sandra
Miller. For the first time, the group's potential was
evident. Now all they need is to find sponsors to back them
until they reach the standard of their competition.
   So DG will probably cut its losses, and Sony Classical,
lacking a Pinnock or Norrington, will fill a gap in its
catalog with the curious choice of a period-instrument group
led by a nonspecialist. That is a fitting commentary on the
current status of the historical-performance movement, which
I think has passed its peak. Its most valuable insights have
already spread as far as they can. What's left now are
opportunities for career advancement and profit. In other
words, business, as usual.
