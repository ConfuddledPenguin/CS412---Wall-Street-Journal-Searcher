   WASHINGTON -- The showdown with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein, dangerous though it is for the entire Middle East,
represents a badly needed opportunity for one country: Egypt.
   Egypt, once despised in Saudi Arabia and often taken for
granted in the U.S., is illustrating during the crisis how
valuable it is to both of those countries. And the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia offer Egypt the best long-term chance to pull
itself out of its economic quagmire.

   But this opportunity also carries deep risks. By standing
beside the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak is taking a chance of being branded as a Western
agent protecting Arab oil assets for use by foreigners.
Iraq's Saddam Hussein, in a message beamed around the Arab
world Friday, sounded such a theme, belittling the "corrupt"
Arabs who invite in U.S. troops and staking his own claim as
the true leader of all Arabs.
   So far, though, Mr. Mubarak has stood his ground. Egypt
has led Arab countries in condemning Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and warning against an Iraqi move into Saudi Arabia --
all despite the fact that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia mistreated
Egypt over the years because of its peace treaty with Israel.
Egypt's agreement to let a U.S. aircraft carrier and other
warships pass through the Suez Canal on their way to the
Persian Gulf illustrates its strategic importance. And
perhaps most dramatically, Mr. Mubarak's attempt to organize
a multinational Arab military force to protect Saudi Arabia
has proven his country's importance as a military ally of
both the U.S. and the Saudis.
   Egyptian leaders "have been very active and they will be
central in the diplomatic solution that allows Saddam Hussein
to climb down from the stool," says Robert Neumann, a former
American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now is director of
Middle East studies at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "It makes our relations with Egypt
more valuable."
   That could translate into a more generous attitude toward
Egypt as Congress considers foreign aid and as the wealthy
Saudi royal family shares its riches. In particular, Mr.
Mubarak's willingness to risk the wrath of Arab radicals and
Islamic fundamentalists by agreeing to send Egyptian soldiers
to serve with Western forces is likely to affect
congressional thinking.
   Egypt is increasingly in need of additional U.S. help. Its
total package of military and economic aid from the U.S.,
after growing in the years after the Camp David peace treaty,
has leveled off. Egypt now gets about $1.3 billion a year in
military aid, $815 million in economic aid and $150 million
to $200 million in food aid.
   Meanwhile, Egypt's bill for repaying old U.S. loans is
exploding. Egypt now owes the U.S. about $12 billion, and
congressional aides say it is $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion
behind in debt repayments. What Egypt most needs -- and what
the Bush administration was beginning to consider even before
the latest gulf crisis -- was a plan to delay or forgive some
of these debt payments.
   Saudi Arabia's leaders, should they survive this crisis,
are in an even better position to help Egypt. After years of
ignoring Egypt's needs, Saudi Arabia recently began giving
credits for grain purchases, diplomats say. Further aid would
be even more beneficial, because aid from another Arab nation
is more palatable in the Arab world than aid from the West.
   Of course, the danger for Mr. Mubarak is that he may gain
favor with the U.S. and its Saudi allies but lose the
propaganda war for the hearts and minds of his own people to
Saddam Hussein and his rhetoric of Arab nationalism. If Mr.
Mubarak lets that happen, Egyptians won't feel gratitude but
rather may turn against him as many did against Anwar Sadat.
   In the propaganda struggle with Saddam Hussein, Mr.
Mubarak has one big advantage: a deep reservoir of resentment
toward Iraq among many Egyptians. More than four million
Egyptians, it's estimated, spent time in Iraq during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war as guest workers, filling menial
jobs while Iraqi men went to the war front. Many say they
were mistreated and weren't allowed to take home money they
earned, and some died under mysterious circumstances after
the war ended.
   Still, Saddam Hussein's weekend call for an uprising
against Arab leaders who support the U.S. represents an
appeal "to the Arab masses," says Robert Hunter, an analyst
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"Mubarak therefore is in a position where he has to worry
about his own survival."
