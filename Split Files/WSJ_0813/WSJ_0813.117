   HOLLYWOOD -- Walt Disney Co. said it reached a five-year
exclusive motion picture distribution agreement with Cinergi
Productions Inc., a new company formed by former Carolco
Pictures Inc. co-chairman Andy Vajna, best-known for
co-producing the "Rambo" series and "Total Recall."
   The deal, which had been rumored in Hollywood for months,
represents a departure for Disney's film division, which,
unlike other studios, hasn't had outside producers regularly
finance and make movies for it to distribute. Though Disney
has wanted to increase the number of films flowing through
its distribution pipeline, it also likes to exert tight
controls over the production of these films. Last year it
started its own new film unit, Hollywood Pictures, rather
than resort to a distribution deal or acquisition.

   Disney will still have strong behind-the-scenes input into
how Cinergi's films are made, industry observers say. And
Disney will be able to release a series of expensively made
films without having to pay for them or sully its image as a
cost-conscious producer unwilling to pay huge sums for
"talent."
   Disney executives see Cinergi as a source of big-budget
action/adventure films, a genre they themselves generally
have avoided. Cinergi's first project is "The Stand," a love
story set in the Amazon rain forest. The film features the
director-actor team from "The Hunt for Red October," John
McTiernan and Sean Connery, with a script by Tom Schulman,
who was involved in writing Disney's two biggest hits of last
year, "Dead Poet's Society" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."
   Mr. Vajna said his company expects to produce two to three
films a year: "event-oriented" pictures with "big stars and
big directors."
   Under the agreement, Disney acquires all North and South
American distribution rights, including home video and
television, while Cinergi and Mr. Vajna, who is experienced
in international distribution, retains distribution rights
for the rest of the world. Partly by pre-selling these
foreign rights, Cinergi will finance the pictures and Disney
will receive a fee for marketing and distribution.
   Mr. Vajna co-founded Carolco with Mario Kassar in 1975 and
departed last year, selling his 36% stake to Mr. Kassar for
more than $100 million.
