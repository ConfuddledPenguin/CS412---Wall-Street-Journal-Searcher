   May Department Stores Co. said it postponed an initial
public offering of stock in its Venture Stores Inc. unit
because of "current market conditions."
   In June, St. Louis-based May said it planned to offer 14%,
or about 2.3 million Venture shares, at between $16 and $18 a
share. May then planned to spin off the remaining Venture
shares to May shareholders.

   Since then, however, the stock market has declined, and
the environment for new offerings is less friendly.
   May nevertheless said it plans to complete the offering
"as soon as market conditions allow," and spin off the
remaining Venture shares before year end.
   The spinoff of the discount chain would allow May to
concentrate on its main business of department stores and
would better capitalize Venture, which plans to expand with
more stores.
