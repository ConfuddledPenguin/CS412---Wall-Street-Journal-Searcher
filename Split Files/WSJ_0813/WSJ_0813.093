   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration exercised its option
to exempt all military personnel accounts from any
across-the-board spending cuts this fall.
   "This is considered to be in the national interest . . .
to maintain the force levels required for our national
security," Budget Director Richard Darman said in notifying
Congress of President Bush's decision on Friday.

   About $84 billion of spending cuts will be triggered in
October by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, unless
Congress and the president agree on a way to shrink the
deficit or alter the law before then.
   Even though Mr. Bush has exempted military personnel, the
law requires that other Pentagon spending accounts absorb
half of any Gramm-Rudman cuts. The Office of Management and
Budget estimates these accounts would be slashed by 34.9%.
Non-defense accounts covered by the law would be cut by
31.9%. Social Security and many other government benefit
programs are exempt.
   Earlier last week, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
indicated that Mr. Bush was planning only to shield some
portion of the military personnel accounts from the cuts.
