   LONDON -- The Western freeze on Iraqi and Kuwaiti finances
is having wider-than-foreseen fallout on financial
institutions throughout the Persian Gulf.
   Free-market exchange rates are slumping and interest rates
are soaring in countries throughout the tense gulf region,
including Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia. There are reports of runs on banks in Bahrain as
depositors seek to cash out local-currency holdings to buy
U.S. dollars.

   Trading in major gulf currencies, including the Saudi
riyal, Bahraini dinar and United Arab Emirates dirham is
becoming increasingly difficult as banks and investors slash
positions to limit their losses if hostilities escalate.
London bankers say Kuwaiti dinars, if anyone will make a
market, have plunged to roughly half the official rate before
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; free-market rates from United
Arab Emirates and Bahraini currencies also have dropped by
15% or more.
   The financial pressure could intensify this week if
hostilities escalate in the Persian Gulf. Ultimately, Western
jitters over the Middle East financial institutions could
signal a fundamental realignment of the costs of financing
business in the region -- raising prices for credit as well
as prompting a re-rating of the risks of doing business
there. "Everyone is reassessing credit risks in the region in
a major way," says Robert Thomas, executive director at
Midland Bank PLC's Midland Montagu international finance unit
in London. Events since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait "show
how suddenly everything can change."
   George Asseily, director of Schroder Asseily &amp; Co., a
London-based investment bank with Mideast interests, adds:
"There has been a major flight to quality" among Gulf
investors. Bankers report a movement of tens of millions of
dollars in private-banking holdings to Switzerland and other
European centers from gulf banks in recent days.
   Outside Iraq and Kuwait, the worst-affected Arab state
appears to be Bahrain, a small trading center poking into the
Persian Gulf. People there reported large crowds pressing to
get into banks prior to last Friday's weekly day off in the
Moslem country, and bankers expect the crowds to return this
week. Some businesses have stopped taking credit cards due to
uncertainties about being paid.
   In London, traders report that a Bahraini bank dumped a
$70 million portfolio of Eurobonds through Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s European offices late last week in order to satisfy
dollar demand among local customers and to avoid a run on the
bank. Many customers reportedly turned around and repurchased
dollar instruments. A Merrill Lynch spokesman declined to
comment. European bankers say such midsized Bahraini banks as
Bahrain Middle East Bank are being buffeted by the upheaval;
at that bank's head office in Bahrain, an official said that
while many Bahraini commercial banks have experienced "panic"
demand for deposits, the bank is operating normally and local
monetary authorities are standing by with adequate support.
   Many international bankers in London say they are
continuing to deal with banking and individual customers
throughout the Persian Gulf. However, they are limiting their
exposure by shortening the time period for repayments and
also by seeking to hedge their exposures through
forward-currency or interest-rate swap agreements. However,
some major foreign-exchange trading rooms say they have
curtailed dealing with clients in the area until tensions
ease.
   For instance, Barclays Bank PLC said it has sharply curbed
trading activities in many currencies in the region,
including those from Jordan and Egypt, following Iraq's
invasion. Adds a foreign exchange dealer in the London
trading room of a major international bank: "People are
steering clear of institutions with anything Arab in the
name."
   Market movements have been striking. For example, some
international bankers report that interest rates in the Saudi
domestic market have surged in the past week. Such rates,
which have traded at 50 basis points, or hundredths of a
percentage point, above benchmark U.S. rates, have surged to
a full-percentage point margin or more above the U.S. rates.
   Some bankers point out that such asset-rich countries as
Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have been inadvertently
caught in the crossfire. While the Saudi financial position
is particularly healthy, bankers are curbing total Mideast
exposures because the asset-clampdown means there is almost
nothing they can do to limit their frozen dealings with
Kuwait. "The international banking community was caught
flat-footed in Kuwait, and as a result they have overreacted
now," said one Mideast banker in London.
   Even some of the region's largest institutions are feeling
the effects. "Banks generally have taken a view toward
limiting their exposure {to the Mideast}. The financial
commmunity isn't happy with Mideast risk," said an official
at Arab Banking Corp., a major Mideast financial institution
based in Bahrain. "But we are comfortable with our liquidity
positions. We see this as temporary hiccup." Last Thursday,
Standard &amp; Poor's placed certain Arab Banking Corp.
short-term and long-term securities on its ratings-watch list
with negative implications. The credit-rating agency said the
substantial minority positions in the bank held by Kuwait's
Ministry of Finance and Libya's Central Bank, both of which
are currently targets of U.S. economic sanctions, makes the
institution subject to future blocking orders.
   Bankers say Mideast financial institutions' liquidation of
certain Western assets -- particularly Euromarket instruments
-- to meet local demand for hard currency is pushing prices
lower. Letters of credit -- a linchpin of international
commerce -- have become more difficult to obtain.
