   NEW YORK -- Comstock Partners carries the bear's torch.
This year, it almost burned the house down.
   Since January, the trio of money managers has applied its
bet-the-ranch style in an investment theme that can be summed
up as: Sell (almost) everything.

   Comstock Partners has been betting against the U.S. stock
market, real estate, the U.S. dollar, Treasury bonds, and the
Tokyo stock market. The firm even slapped this year's
stock-market darlings across the face: It sold growth stocks
short.
   All the firm owns are some energy and gold stocks, and
various countries' short-term government debt, including U.S.
Treasury bills.
   Less than two weeks ago, many would have regarded such a
position as outrageous. One of the Comstock Partners, Michael
Aronstein, mused in his office here recently: "We've been
bears in a bull market. If we're wrong here, we aren't only
going to be laughing stocks, we will be out of the investment
management business {by} this time next year."
   Comstock's midyear performance was so bad that one client
couldn't stomach it anymore. In June, a state pension fund
yanked its $35 million out of Comstock's private money
management business, and walked away. The Dreyfus Capital
Value Fund, which the partners manage, limped 10.37
percentage points behind Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index at
the end of June, according to Morningstar Inc.
   But a turnaround may be at hand. By Aug. 3, the fund
snapped back to lag the S&amp;P by just four percentage points,
Morningstar says. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average's
280-point dive from a record high, the indigestion in the
bond market and the dollar's fragility have made Comstock
Partners' strategy look less radical, if not undeniably
smarter.
   Though Mr. Aronstein and his partners, Stanley Salvigsen
and Charles Minter, aren't planning to send a thank-you note
to Saddam Hussein, plunging stock and bond prices following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have been incredibly fortuitous for
them. As Mr. Aronstein prefers to put it, exploding oil
prices merely called to everybody's attention the fractures
in the stock and bond markets that were already evident to
guess who.
   With the outlook far from clear, and the bulls slightly
stunned, however, it's time for Comstock Partners to tell its
story. It's not a pretty tale. As Louis Markatos, portfolio
manager at IDS Financial Services says: "They articulate the
risks in the system as well as anybody. If {these risks}
materialize, we're in deep" trouble.
   Comstock Partners' hobbyhorse for the past 10 years has
been a series of prophetic calls, always accompanied by
high-rolling bets, on speculative booms and deflations. They
made their predictions in more than a dozen reports with such
provocative titles as "32nds Over Tokyo," "Homesick" and
"That Ain't Mud On Your Boots, Partner."
   The way Comstock sees it, as long as deflationary debacles
were isolated in sectors -- such as real estate or precious
metals -- credit, which fuels all investment, could be
quickly funneled into the next arena of speculative activity
-- the stock market, for example.
   In 1982 when the banking system groaned under loads of bad
farm and Third World debt, the Federal Reserve cut interest
rates by increasing the money supply. Some of that money
rushed into stocks. Though a recession was in progress, the
S&amp;P index finished 1982 with a 14.76% gain.
   As long as some sector within the broad economy was in
decline, and credit was flowing freely, interest rates stayed
relatively low and sometimes fell rapidly, rewarding
bondholders and usually lifting stocks.
   The same script is in play for 1990, according to the
stock-market bulls. One of them, Roger Engemann, a
growth-stock manager in Pasadena, Calif., says, "So what if
there's a recession? Interest rates would plummet and the
stock market would go straight up." In an Aug. 6 letter to
clients headlined "Buy Now]" Mr. Engemann notes that past
years of declining corporate profits haven't always resulted
in negative returns on stocks. A chart he produced shows that
in only one of the past six recessions did the S&amp;P index have
a down year; that was 1957.
   But Comstock Partners argues that the 1990s will be "a
whole new ball game." Federal safety nets have been thrown
under credit-shaky sectors, such as savings and loans. Now, a
downturn in the economy will give the government a growing
list of defaults to deal with, from student loans to real
estate. Instead of allowing bad debts to pass naturally, if
painfully, into extinction, the government keeps their
carcasses breathing with the life-support apparatus of
federal debt. With each new default, a government bond is
born.
   "The workings of this mechanism whereby the government
borrows to pay for a useless asset a second time means that
deflation now leads to a heightened pace of debt issuance
rather than liquidation," the partners write in a report
entitled "The Plumber Never Flushes Twice."
   A recession, Comstock Partners concludes, will produce a
sharp, devastating rise in interest rates, rather than a
decline. And that means the next investment vehicles in line
for deflation are stocks and bonds, which is why Comstock
Partners is staying clear of just about every investment
except cash.
   "Interest rates aren't going to go down despite all the
problems, so stocks are overvalued," Mr. Aronstein says.
"We've shorted a lot" of stocks -- meaning Comstock sold
borrowed shares in anticipation of price declines, hoping to
replace them later more cheaply.
   Mr. Aronstein derides hopes for lower interest rates and
rising stock prices this year as believing in "the liquidity
fairy." He adds: "Corporate profits are inflated by credit
and deflated by stagnation of credit. If people can't borrow,
their spending power is limited." As a result, he says,
consumer-related growth stocks are in for a sharp
re-evaluation.
   "What we're saying is that the overhang of debt service
has taken its toll across the society," Mr. Aronstein says.
"And the government, which has been the freest and easiest in
the world with other people's money, will be disciplined by
the market."
   Though their self-confidence seems abundant, following
their instincts has produced some harrowing experiences for
the partners. With returns up about 40% in August 1987, the
group started dumping their stock positions and buying bonds.
Bonds fell, and losses mounted. Then Black Monday came, and
all of a sudden Comstock looked as smooth as a toreador
sidestepping a stuck bull. The Capital Value Fund finished up
34.45% in 1987, according to Morningstar, beating the S&amp;P
index by 29.23 percentage points.
   By December 1988, the partners were foretelling a major
collapse of the junk bond market. Predicting a flight to
high-quality debt, they started buying U.S. Treasury bonds
until eventually they owned about 2% of all the $140 billion
of long-term government debt then outstanding. They sold
short several junk bond mutual funds, betting their prices
would fall. That paid off in a 25.31% return on the Dreyfus
fund for 1989, which was 6.36 percentage points behind the
S&amp;P but an enviable performance among money managers.
   "We're just going to do what we think is right," says Mr.
Aronstein about the firm's latest bet. He adds: "We commit to
extremes. If we go out, it will be like {tightrope walker}
Karl Wallenda -- 110 feet out onto the hood of a car."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stocks moved broadly and sharply lower as few buyers
wanted to acquire stocks at the start of what might have been
a crucial weekend in the Middle East crisis.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had climbed a
total of 48.27 points in the two prior sessions as investors
bargain-hunted, retreated 42.33 to 2716.58. Trading slowed to
145,340,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange from
155,810,000 shares Thursday.
   For the week, the industrial average fell 93.07 -- the
second largest weekly point loss so far this year -- or 3.3%;
it was the fourth consecutive weekly decline, the longest
losing streak in about 21 months. During these four weeks,
the average has fallen 263.62 points, or 8.8%.
   The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Equity Market indexes each
fell 2.7% last week, while the Big Board composite index
dropped 2.5%.
   Concerns about the possible escalation of hostilities in
the Middle East translated into buying of precious-metals
stocks, usually a safe haven for investors in uncertain
periods. Placer Dome rose 7/8 to 17 7/8 in Big Board
composite trading of 1.6 million shares, American Barrick
Resources rose 1 3/4 to 21 7/8, Battle Mountain Gold rose 3/4
to 12 5/8, Hecla Mining added 1/2 to 12 1/4 and
   Homestake Mining climbed 1 1/2 to 21 7/8.
   Selected oil stocks also rallied amid the market's retreat
as the Persian Gulf situation pushed oil prices higher;
Chevron gained 1 1/8 to 78; Phillips Petroleum gained 7/8 to
29 1/2, and Unocal rose 1/2 to 32. But Exxon slid 1/4 to 51
5/8 on 1.3 million shares; Texaco closed up 1/4 at 63 1/8,
and Mobil closed unchanged at 65 7/8.
   McDermott International dropped 3/8 to 32 5/8 after
reporting that its loss for the June quarter was more than
double the year-earlier level, but most oil field-services
issues rose. Global Marine gained 3/8 to 5 7/8 on 2.1 million
shares; Schlumberger rose 1/8 to 66 1/8; Baker Hughes added
3/4 to 32 7/8, and Halliburton went up 1/4 to 56 1/4.
   Blue-chip issues, especially the growth stocks that had
fueled the market's two-day rebound, were hit hardest. Boeing
went down 1 1/4 to 53 1/4 on 1.8 million shares; Philip
Morris fell 5/8 to 45 7/8; Wal-Mart Stores was off 3/4 to 29
7/8, and Waste Management dropped 1 5/8 to 38 1/4.
   Eli Lilly, hit with another lawsuit in connection with its
antidepressant drug Prozac, fell 2 3/4 to 75 1/4 on 1.3
million shares.
   Among other drug stocks, Merck dropped 1 1/4 to 84 3/4;
Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 3/4 to 66 1/8, and Warner-Lambert lost
1 7/8 to 63 1/8. Schering-Plough slid 1/2 to 46 1/2; the
company halted world-wide registration and marketing of a
hypertension drug, citing "isolated cases of liver toxicity"
in users.
   United Telecommunications rose 7/8 to 26 1/4 on 3.1
million shares amid takeover rumors, fueled by a television
report citing General Electric and BellSouth as potential
suitors. Officials at United Telecom and BellSouth couldn't
be reached for comment, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report; GE declined to comment.
