   TACOMA, Wash. -- Weyerhaeuser Co. said it will open one of
the nation's largest paper recycling facilities in Portland,
Ore., by the end of the year.
   The plant will be devoted exclusively to the collection,
sorting and redistribution of old newspapers and other paper
products. The new facility will supply the giant pulp and
paper company's North Pacific Paper Corp. newsprint mill in
Longview, Wash. Company officials are working to expand
production there by as much as 50% and add a de-inking
facility by mid-1991.

   The new plant is expected to handle 700,000 tons of paper
a day, which represents about 150,000 daily newspapers, and
employ 70 to 80 people. The company owns and operates 16
recycling facilities.
