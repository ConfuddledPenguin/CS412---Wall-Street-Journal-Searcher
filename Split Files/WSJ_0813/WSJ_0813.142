   TOKYO -- Despite a 10.3% decrease in Japan's trade surplus
during July, economists continued to say that the imbalance
is likely to widen later this year.
   The Finance Ministry said Friday that the surplus fell to
$5.38 billion in July from $6 billion a year earlier, as
declines in the surpluses with the U.S. and the European
Community offset a 43% rise in the trade imbalance with other
Asian nations.

   Even though the overall surplus narrowed, exports --
measured on a customs-cleared basis -- rose for the second
consecutive month following eight consecutive monthly
declines. They gained 1.8% from a year earlier, to $23.89
billion. And although imports rose 6%, to $18.51 billion,
economists said the growth in imports appears to be tailing
off.
   "Exports are going up and import growth is weakening,"
said Yoichi Tazawa, an economist at Nomura Research
Institute.
   Officials at the Finance Ministry, however, indicated they
didn't share that view. While one-time factors contributed to
a jump in the June surplus, the July figures suggest
continued improvement in the balance, they said.
   The officials also noted that manufactured goods accounted
for 54.3% of total imports in July -- the highest level since
officials began following that measure several years ago.
Imports of manufactured goods are considered significant
because critics of Japanese trade practices assert that the
country tends to discourage imports with a high value-added
content.
   The July figures, of course, didn't reflect the surge in
oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Should
oil prices remain high, Japan's import bill would rise.
Nevertheless, at their current levels, it is unlikely that
higher oil prices will prevent Japan's overall surplus from
rising in coming months, economists said.
   The yen's weakening during the past year has increased the
competitiveness of Japanese exports by making them less
expensive in terms of other currencies. At the same time, it
has made imports more costly. And massive investment by
Japanese corporations in plant and equipment has further
strengthened their competitive position.
   S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc. expects the surplus
to grow in the second half. But chief economist Jesper Koll
said the firm has trimmed its forecast for the overall 1990
surplus to $68 billion from $70 billion and has lowered its
1991 projection to $70.3 billion from $80 billion -- assuming
that oil prices remain between $22 and $25 a barrel. (Oil for
September delivery was quoted at $26.23 a barrel in New York
on Friday.) Japan's trade surplus was $64.32 billion in 1989
and $77.56 billion in 1988.
   In July, the politically sensitive surplus with the U.S.
declined 20.5% from a year earlier, to $3.07 billion from
$3.86 billion. Imports from the U.S. rose 5%, to $4.45
billion. Exports to the U.S. fell 7.2%, to $7.51 billion.
   The surplus with the European Community fell 29.9%, to
$1.15 billion from $1.64 billion. A nearly five-fold increase
in the value of imported paintings helped account for a 36.4%
rise in imports from the EC, to $3.19 billion. Exports to the
EC rose 9.1%, to $4.34 billion.
   Japan's surplus with the rest of Asia, excluding China,
surged for the second consecutive month, jumping 43%, to
$2.49 billion from $1.74 billion. Exports to the rest of Asia
rose 7.3%, to $7.53 billion. Imports from the rest of Asia
declined 4.5%, to $5.04 billion.
   After seasonal adjustment, Japan's overall trade surplus
was $4.76 billion in July, down 30.9% from June.
