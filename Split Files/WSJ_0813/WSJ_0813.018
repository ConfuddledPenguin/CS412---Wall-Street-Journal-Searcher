   Nestle S.A. posted sales of 22.7 billion francs ($16.9
billion) for the first half of 1990, compared with 22.8
billion francs a year earlier.
   The Vevey, Switzerland, food company cited the weakness of
several currencies against the Swiss franc as the main reason
for the flat sales. The results matched analysts'
expectations.

   Analysts expect Nestle's group net income for the full
year to rise as much as 10%, depending on currency rates,
from the year-earlier 2.41 billion francs.
