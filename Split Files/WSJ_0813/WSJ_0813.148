   I am a power person.
   I wear a power suit,
   I tote a power briefcase,
   I stride the power route
   Into my power office
   And give a dim, grim frown
   To learn a power outage
   Has shut the whole works down.
   -- Mary Margaret Milbrath.

   When you think you have someone eating out of your hand,
count your fingers.
