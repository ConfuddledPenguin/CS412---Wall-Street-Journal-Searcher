   HONG KONG -- As China's de facto consulate in this British
colony, the local branch of the Xinhua news agency has long
acted as loyal foot soldier in the central government's
diplomatic offensives.
   Rallying to Beijing's xenophobia of the 1960s, Xinhua
helped orchestrate street riots then by fanning anti-colonial
sentiment in Hong Kong.

   When Chinese communism took a moderate turn in the early
1980s, the agency dutifully changed strategy. To erase public
memories of Beijing's former excesses, it courted the
colony's wealthy and sang capitalism's praises.
   None of that compares, though, with the struggle Xinhua
now faces.
   The agency has been rocked by the flight of Xu Jiatun,
head of the Hong Kong branch until he retired in February.
While in office, he had failed to take a firm stand against
the pro-democracy protests that roiled the Chinese capital
last year. Apparently fearing retribution, he fled to the
U.S. four weeks ago. The affair has touched off an internal
inquiry into Mr. Xu's previous activities in Hong Kong. As if
all this isn't trouble enough, the branch is locked in a pay
dispute with its mid-level staff members.
   Such ideological wavering and squabbling over money
represent extraordinary lapses for an institution that
habitually toes the party line. Zhou Nan, Mr. Xu's successor,
appears untainted by the turmoil. And in his public dealings
with Hong Kong authorities, he, perhaps more dutifully than
Mr. Xu, reflects the tough political line adopted by Beijing
since it crushed the democracy movement one year ago. But to
many outsiders, Mr. Zhou faces a bigger challenge by far from
the disarray within the organization he heads.
   "Clearly, Xinhua's operations in Hong Kong have been hit
badly in terms of public image and staff morale," says
Anthony Cheung, a senior lecturer in public and social
administration at the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong. "Mr.
Zhou is going to have his hands full putting his own house
back in order."
   Mr. Zhou's troubled domain mirrors in many ways the
chaotic state of China's politics today. While alarmed by
communism's decline in Eastern Europe, the Chinese leadership
evidently lacks consensus on how to save itself from the same
fate. Facing a widespread desire for democracy, it vacillates
between brutal repression and appeasement. For the ailing
economy as well, harsh socialist remedies are being applied
in tandem with half-baked capitalist experiments. With the
leadership guided seemingly by few consistent goals other
than self-preservation, party functionaries can't help
becoming demoralized.
   Some of these policy contradictions are felt acutely in
Hong Kong. Governed for 150 years by Britain, the colony is
to return to China's rule in 1997. As a matter of national
pride, Beijing is keen to see the transition embraced by the
colony's mainly ethnic-Chinese population. Yet these very
same people, steeped in their Western-oriented values, also
rank among the loudest critics of communist rule in China.
That leaves Beijing trying alternately to cow and to placate
them. As the Chinese government's main policy tool in Hong
Kong, Xinhua seems stuck with an impossible task.
   "What's happening at Xinhua is a reflection of the
spiritual confusion that pervades the Chinese government,"
says a local businessman familiar with the Beijing political
scene. "There're so many zigzags at the top that you never
know if what's called a policy one day will be branded a
mistake the next."
   Such insecurity has permeated the hundreds of
China-controlled entities in Hong Kong since last June 4,
when soldiers fired on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square. In the immediate aftermath, staff from just about all
the organizations -- from the local branch of the Bank of
China to the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, a leftist
labor organizer -- took part in public rallies to condemn the
crackdown. Virtually all have since fallen silent.
   An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Hong Kong residents
recently joined in a march to mark the anniversary of the
Tiananmen killings. The rally, which ended with the marchers
assembling outside the Xinhua office building, didn't include
the many banners in evidence in Hong Kong protests last year
that identified the participation of those China-controlled
organizations.
   The price for their momentary indiscretion last year is
being borne mostly by Xinhua's Hong Kong unit. The agency's
unique responsibility arises from China's refusal to
recognize British sovereignty over Hong Kong. Rather than
establish a formal consulate in what it considers its own
territory, Beijing uses the agency to represent its
interests. In China and dozens of locations around the world,
Xinhua is a state-run news agency. In Hong Kong, it is that
and much more.
   The colony's proximity to China and its large
ethnic-Chinese population give rise to extensive bilateral
ties. Hong Kong generates about 30% to 40% of China's
foreign-currency earnings. It offers glimpses into modern
business management and technology to the thousands of
Chinese officials who visit every year. As the ties have
proliferated, so has the number of state-run entities, which
require supervision and periodic indoctrination. All this
gives an exalted status to Xinhua's local branch, China's
highest authority in Hong Kong.
   With 1997 approaching, the unit's profile is being
elevated even more. In its frequent second-guessing of the
colonial administration, Xinhua has come to be viewed widely
as a parallel authority in the territory. Local residents
bring their grievances to the agency. On a major issue such
as the replacement airport that the Hong Kong government
wants to build, many local and foreign banks are withholding
support pending a final say from Xinhua.
   Despite this considerable status, the about 600 Xinhua
staff members in Hong Kong are paid subsistence wages by
local standards.
   The bulk of the staff -- whether hired locally or posted
from China -- is drawn from the party faithful. And for
decades, they appeared to have accepted serving the party as
sufficient reward. It thus came as a surprise to many
outsiders when the local recruits rebelled en masse a couple
of months ago over a pay dispute. Offered a 10% raise, they
demanded an increase comparable to the 15% average in the
private sector. Mr. Zhou, having agreed to consider the
demand, apparently hasn't been able to work out a solution so
far.
   But his predecessor's dramatic flight has left Mr. Zhou
his biggest challenge.
   Along with several relatives, Mr. Xu left China in early
May. Two associates who claim to have assisted him have
released snapshots showing the grandfatherly Mr. Xu
sightseeing in California. The two -- one a Buddhist monk
from Taiwan and the other a Hong Kong journalist -- gave few
details on his whereabouts or why he left. In the U.S.,
authorities have confirmed his presence there but declined
comment otherwise. Beijing likewise has said nothing beyond
confirming that he has gone abroad.
   Although neither government characterizes Mr. Xu's move as
a defection, Chinese officials in Hong Kong privately confirm
that he left China without obtaining the exit authorization
that is required of all senior government personnel.
   Mr. Zhou has since held several rounds of meetings with
high-level Chinese officials stationed in Hong Kong to
discuss the affair. Mr. Xu's action was described by Mr. Zhou
as an "unauthorized departure," says an official who attended
one of the meetings. Mr. Zhou said further "that Mr. Xu will
face serious consequences unless he returns voluntarily," the
official adds.
   Among steps aimed ostensibly at damage control, a few
Xinhua officials deemed close to Mr. Xu have been called to
Beijing for questioning. The agency denies that a shake-up of
the Hong Kong branch is in the offing. Still, some Chinese
officials stationed in the territory say they expect such a
shake-up to take place once the inquiry is complete. Some
also say that new measures are being drafted by Beijing to
further restrict overseas travel by senior officials.
