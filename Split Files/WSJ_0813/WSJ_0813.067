   MCCONNELLSBURG, Pa. -- JLG Industries Inc. said it will
cut its McConnellsburg plant work force by 150, as a result
of soft residential and commercial construction markets.
   There has already been a reduction of 135 workers over the
past several months at the company's domestic and foreign
facilities.

   The maker of hydraulic machinery reported that its work
force after the reduction will total about 1,400, with 1,150
in the U.S. and 250 overseas.
