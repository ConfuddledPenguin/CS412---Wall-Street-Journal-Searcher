   NEWTON, Mass. -- Thomas G. Stemberg, chairman and chief
executive officer of Staples Inc., said he "doesn't quarrel"
with analysts estimates that the company will post fiscal
second-quarter operating profit of one to two cents a share.
   A tax-loss carry-forward gain in the quarter ended July 28
is expected to increase the per-share net income by one cent,
Mr. Stemberg said in an interview.

   In the year-ago quarter, the company had net income of
$72,000, or one cent a share, including a $24,000 tax-loss
carryforward benefit.
   Mr. Stemberg said he also is comfortable with projections
by analysts that the company's second-quarter sales will be
between $64 million and $64.5 million. That would be more
than a 70% rise in sales from the year-ago sales of $37.1
million.
   The company said it plans to report its second-quarter
financial results on Aug. 15 or 16.
   Staples, a four-year-old company that sells office
products exclusively, went public last April. The concern
buys merchandise in bulk, hence at relatively cheap prices,
and passes on the discounts to customers.
   Mr. Stemberg also said he wouldn't dispute analysts'
estimates for the full year. "To the extent that one can be
accountable for a company in the kind of growth that we find
ourselves in, income for the full year {before benefit from a
tax loss carry-forward} would probably be within an eye shot
of the 55 cents to 56 cents per share analysts are
estimating," Mr. Stemberg said. Annual sales estimates of
about $312 million also wouldn't be far off the mark, he
added.
   For the year ended Jan. 27, 1990, Staples reported
operating profit of $4.2 million, or 45 cents a share. A
tax-loss carry-forward gain of $1.5 million, or 16 cents a
share, made net income $5.7 million, 61 cents a share. Sales
were $181.7 million.
   Annual growth in stores opened for more than a year is
expected to decline in percentage points to the high teens
overall, down from the 33.6% recorded last year, the company
said. Sales at stores in the second year of operations are
expected to grow by 30% or more, while sales growth at older
stores could slow to about 10%.
   Mr. Stemberg attributed part of the slowdown to the
retailer's strategy of saturating the market. As the company
continues to dot the map with new store openings in one
vicinity, sales growth at older stores in nearby towns drop,
albeit "at a surprising slower rate than anticipated," he
added.
   The flat economy in the Northeast, where most of the
company's stores are concentrated, has helped the company's
paper products segment as a result of its low-price strategy,
Mr. Stemberg said. But he noted that spending on items such
as furniture, fax machines and other large ticket items, has
slowed, though "not significantly enough to fundamentally
change the firm's sales growth projections for the year."
Approximately 75% of Staples sales come from small
businesses.
   As a result of increased competition, Staples' margins for
the second quarter, particularly in Southern California,
where it operates three stores, are below expectations, Mr.
Stemberg said. However, the company "has offset margin
reductions by reducing operating expenses by an equal order
of magnitude," he added. Sales from its Southern California
stores this year should represent less than 3% of the
company's overall sales. That should increase to about 10% of
total sales next year as the company plans to open 18 to 20
new stores in the area.
   Staples added that two "new strategic moves" should fuel
growth in the coming months. The company has just opened a
32,000-square-foot delivery distribution center in Putnam,
Conn., across the street from its 136,000-square-foot
distribution facility, he said. The additional space will
quicken service along the Northeast corridor and help the
company make good on its next-day guaranteed delivery of
orders placed by telephone.
   Also, in October, Staples, which mostly has outlets in
suburbs, plans to open a 6,000-square foot Staples Express
Store in Boston's financial district. The store will serve as
a prototype for more than 30 stores slated for openings in
other major cities, including New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington, D.C., in the next several years.
   Staples, which now operates 51 stores, plans to open
another 20 stores by the end of the year and an additional 30
or more next year.
   Some analysts have said that the company's aggressive plan
leaves little room for mistakes and predict profits will be
slim. But Mr. Stemberg said the company is "very proud of the
kind of results it has achieved for investors {since it went
public last year} and comfortable and confident of our plans
for the future."
