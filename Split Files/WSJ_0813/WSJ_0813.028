   In the Middle East nothing is quite what it seems to be,
and there are always differing, sometimes conflicting,
explanations of whatever happens. The recent war between Iraq
and Iran was variously explained as a struggle for hegemony
between two regional powers, as an ethnic conflict between
Arabs and Persians, as an ideological clash between Ba'thist
secularism and Islamic fundamentalism and even as a sectarian
squabble between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims.
   Similar variety may be seen in reactions to the current
Middle Eastern crisis, launched by Saddam Hussein's invasion
and annexation of Kuwait. In the broader world outside the
Middle East, the perception of what has happened and of what
needs to be done shows a unanimity unknown since the defeat
of Adolf Hitler.

   Kuwait is after all a classical example of a small,
unoffending, peaceful country, invaded and swallowed by a
ruthless and aggressive neighbor. It is indeed difficult to
find, even in the checkered history of this century, so clear
a case of unprovoked aggression. The Kuwaitis never attacked
Iraq in word or deed, oppressed no Iraqi minority and gave no
shelter or encouragement to terrorist or guerrilla opponents
of Iraq -- on the contrary, they provided vital help to the
Iraqis during the long war against Iran, and ran one of the
least repressive regimes in the region.
   But not everyone shares the Western, and especially the
European, perception of Saddam Hussein as another Hitler
without Hitler's charm, nor would such a comparison be seen
by all as wholly negative. In the Middle East, some other
perceptions have been expressed, notably in the
English-speaking samples of public opinion provided to
Western media correspondents by local support services.
According to one view, energetically promoted by the
government of Iraq and its supporters, the rulers of Kuwait
-- and by implication others like them -- were Western
lackeys, agents of foreign imperialism in the Arab lands, and
Saddam Hussein is an Arab hero, who, by annexing Kuwait, took
the first step toward the liberation and unification of the
Arab world.
   In this perception, he is the heir of Nasser, of Saladin,
and -- in his own rhetoric -- of Nebuchadnezzar. He will
resume and complete the unfinished work of Nasser, and deal
with the enemies of the Arabs as Saladin dealt with the
Crusaders and Nebuchadnezzar with the Jews. Neither was an
Arab, but both were natives of Iraq.
   In another perception, often linked with the first, his
role model -- not named of course -- is not so much Nasser or
Saladin, but Robin Hood. This involved an abrupt switch.
During the war with Iran, Saddam Hussein was the defender of
the sheikly order in the Gulf against Iranian revolutionary
subversion. In his new role, he is himself the subverter of
rich and tyrannical old regimes, in the name of social
justice and pan-Arab egalitarianism.
   In a speech Friday, Saddam Hussein attempted yet another,
even more startling switch -- from secularist bulwark against
Islamic fundamentalism at home and abroad to defender of the
faith and claimant to the custody of the holy places, until
now a duty and privilege of the House of Saud. The call to
"jihad" will always have some appeal, though Saddam Hussein's
guise as holy warrior may lack plausibility. There is surely
a note of desperation in this appeal to religious passions.
   In the first two of these roles, perhaps even in the
third, he may win some support among the many discontented --
though more outside than inside Iraq. There is still a deep
yearning for a great Arab Moslem leader who will end foreign
and infidel ascendancy and restore Arab glory; there is also
a profound social resentment against the oil-rich rulers who
are condemned equally whether they squander or invest their
wealth. In all these roles -- as champion of the Arabs, as
sword of Islam and as avenger of the poor -- support for
Saddam Hussein will be reinforced by the respect that is owed
to power and the will to use it -- to ruthlessness and of
course, to success.
   But even among those who respond emotionally to such
appeals, there are doubts. Is he really working for the
greater Arab or Moslem cause or just for his own personal
aggrandizement? Will he really bring about a redistribution
of the wealth of the old regimes, or merely transfer it to
his own control, and in the meantime deprive great numbers of
young men from Jordan and Egypt and elsewhere of the
employment opportunities that the Gulf states and Saudi
Arabia offered? The past record of Iraq is not encouraging.
   As well as those who accept Saddam Hussein's claims, there
must be significant numbers of Arabs and other Middle
Easterners who share the perception of the rest of the world
-- that the invasion of Kuwait was an act of blatant
aggression, which must not be allowed to succeed. In the
Middle East as elsewhere, those old enough to remember or
wise enough to learn from history will recall an earlier
sequence of events -- the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the
Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the German seizure of Austria
and then Czechoslovakia. These events led directly to the
collapse of the international order and the outbreak of World
War II. If Saddam Hussein succeeds in his gamble, the United
Nations, already devalued, will follow the defunct League of
Nations into ignominy. The world will belong to the violent
and the ruthless, and we shall all be on the way to a Third
World War.
