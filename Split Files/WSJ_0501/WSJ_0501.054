   WASHINGTON -- Maybe it was inevitable for a president
named Bush: George has become a tree hugger.
   In an effort to show that he loves the environment, Mr.
Bush has been planting trees with abandon. So far, he has
plopped them into the ground in seven states and one foreign
land. He gives them to White House visitors; more than 10,000
pine seedlings were carried away by the tykes who roamed the
White House lawn for the annual Easter Egg Roll. And he is
trying to persuade Americans to plant a billion of them a
year on private land.

   Mr. Bush is even getting foreign leaders into the act.
When he recently met British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
in the British colony of Bermuda, the two planted a pair of
palm trees. As usual, gardeners had dug the holes in advance,
but the president furiously tossed in 16 shovelfuls of dirt
to polish off the planting.
   The islanders graciously provided the trees for the
occasion. But several of the others Mr. Bush has been
planting actually are offshoots of trees growing on the White
House lawn, including some from the oldest one planted by a
president, an American elm that John Quincy Adams planted in
1826. The saplings are cultivated in nurseries in suburban
Washington until the trees reach a suitable height for
presidential planting.
   "Presidents," explains White House aide Emily Mead, "don't
plant seedlings."
   So far, by White House account, Mr. Bush has planted three
American elms, two zelkova elms, a patmore ash, a bonfire
silver maple, a ponderosa pine, a red bud, a centennial bur
oak as well as the Bermuda palm. Not all plantings have been
unqualified successes. Vandals attacked an elm he planted in
Spokane, Wash., yanking it out of the ground and tearing off
some of its branches. City officials removed the tree to what
White House officials would describe only as a "secure
location." Gardeners are trying to nurse the poor thing back
to health. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack,
and the tree muggers remain at large.
   Chagrined officials in Bismarck, N.D., discovered shortly
after a presidential planting that their elm was infested
with gypsy moths -- a malady that the officials say hadn't
been seen in the state before. The tree was sprayed to kill
the larvae, and it is now thriving.
   Each time the president plants a tree, he offers a little
stump speech. Among other things, Mr. Bush says, trees take
in carbon dioxide, which has been linked to global warming.
And three well-placed, mature trees can cut a home's air
conditioning needs by 10% to 50%. "By planting trees in all
50 states," he tells audiences, "we'll knock Johnny Appleseed
out of the Guinness Book of Records." (Actually, he doesn't
appear to be in the Guinness Book of World Records.)
   Environmentalists grouse that the president's campaign is
little more than a public relations gimmick. Michael
Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense
Fund, an environmental activist group says he supports the
president's efforts. However, "the amount of carbon dioxide
that will be stripped out of the atmosphere by this
tree-planting program is just a small percent of the total
that will be emitted by man, or even by the U.S.," he says.
   White House aides see the horticultural binge as a way for
the self-proclaimed "environmental president" to show he is
different from his predecessor. Ronald Reagan's most
memorable moment involving trees was an infamous 1980
assertion that they actually cause air pollution, which led
his press secretary to refer jocularly to "killer trees."
When Mr. Reagan visited a college campus after making the
remark, students strung a banner from a tall oak that read:
"Chop Me Before I Kill Again."
   (As it turns out, Mr. Reagan may not have been that much
of a sap. Recent research suggests that some hydrocarbon
compounds given off by trees team up with emissions from cars
and factories and may contribute to smog problems in some
cities. But most experts say the impact is so small as to be
inconsequential.)
   Mr. Bush's focus on trees can be traced largely to a
32-year-old aide named James Pinkerton, who at 6 feet 9
inches tall is rather tree-like in stature himself. He was
issues director of the 1988 Bush campaign and became known as
a brilliant tactician for, among other things, spotting the
Pledge of Allegiance as a potent political issue.
   Now Mr. Pinkerton is a White House domestic policy
planner. Last year, he decided that trees could be powerful
symbols of Mr. Bush's interest in cleaning up America. He
thought getting Americans into the tree-planting act would be
politically advantageous, too, since the environment is again
chic.
   Ms. Mead, a transplanted New Yorker who has been working
for Mr. Bush on and off since 1978, spends most of her time
promoting trees. She works the halls of Congress pushing
legislation Mr. Bush has proposed to create a private,
nonprofit National Tree Trust. The trust would encourage
local governments, corporations and private citizens to plant
trees.
   This volunteer approach is to be like "a thousand points
of green light," says Ms. Mead, whose office is adorned with
"Trees Are the Answer" bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing
slogans such as "Rooting for America."
   When John Adams, the second president, and an
environmentalist progenitor of Mr. Bush's, moved into the
White House in 1800, he found the grounds "a barren expanse
strewn with building rubble and abandoned brick kilns," a
White House brochure says. So he and his successors set about
landscaping the place. The 18-acre grounds now hold some 500
trees and 4,000 shrubs, and all plantings carefully follow a
plan laid out in 1935. Every president since Herbert Hoover
has planted at least one tree himself.
   Mr. Bush has planted two at the White House, an ash and a
red bud.
   The president's tree fixation isn't without some hazard:
bad puns. Mr. Bush said recently that he has "been planting
so many trees all over the country that I might have to open
a branch office."
