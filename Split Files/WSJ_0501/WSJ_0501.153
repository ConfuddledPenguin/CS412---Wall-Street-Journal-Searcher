   LANCASTER, Pa. -- The management of Armstrong World
Industries Inc. said that it won at least three of the four
board seats contested at yesterday's annual meeting by
nominees of Canada's Belzberg family, which has repeatedly
said it might make a bid for the company.
   The Belzbergs, owners of an 11.5% stake in Armstrong, said
they were "confident" they had elected at least one
candidate, Harvard Business School Prof. Michael C. Jensen,
based on proxies submitted to them.

   The flooring and building products concern said that a
final tally of the votes cast by shareholders wouldn't be
available until at least May 11. The counting process is
complicated by Armstrong's cumulative voting system, in which
shareholders were given four votes per share and allowed to
divide those votes among the eight candidates in any way they
chose. In addition, Armstrong said that some proxies may be
contested.
   Although no Belzberg family members attended the meeting,
their representatives called the election a victory for
shareholders. "(Mr. Jensen) is a voice that will give a
different shareholder perspective," said Robi Blumenstein,
senior vice president of First City Capital Corp., a Belzberg
merchant bank. "We weren't seeking control of the board,"
added Scott D. Robbins, a First City vice president.
   But William W. Adams, Armstrong's chairman and chief
executive officer, said that capturing one of four seats
hardly constituted an endorsement of the Belzbergs or their
agenda. "My arithmetic doesn't call that a victory," Mr.
Adams said in an interview.
   The annual meeting was calm, with no argument over the
candidates or five governance proposals offered by the
Belzbergs. The audience of about 600 people was mostly made
up of local shareholders and retired employees.
   Mr. Adams drew a standing ovation when he reiterated the
board's longstanding position against selling the company. He
added that Armstrong is committed to keeping its furniture
business, which the Belzbergs would like to see sold.
   The company said it will allocate the votes from the
proxies it controls after a preliminary tally of other votes
is made. Armstrong's nominees for re-election to the
13-member board are Barbara Hackman Franklin, Joseph L.
Jones, Robert F. Patton and Harry K. Wells.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Armstrong common closed at $33 a share, up 37.5
cents.
   Representatives of the Belzbergs said their fight with
Armstrong's management isn't over. The family is contesting a
second board seat, for Richard E. Bennett, chairman of
Scovill Inc., a Belzberg-owned fastener manufacturer.
   And the Belzbergs continue to seek a binding shareholder
vote on five proposed amendments to Armstrong's charter that
would make it easier for shareholders to take action without
the board's consent, such as accepting a buy-out offer.
Although some stockholders expressed opinions on the
proposals on their proxy cards, a federal judge has yet to
rule on their validity.
