   To some, San Francisco's solid-waste transfer station is
just a dump that handles 2,000 tons of trash a day.
   To William Wareham, it's an inspiration "to another side
of my creative direction. It's energizing." Mr. Wareham, an
abstract metal sculptor, recently became the dump's first
artist-in-residence.

   "It's an absolutely wonderful way of dealing with the
problem" of too much rubbish, says Claire Isaacs, the city's
director of cultural affairs, who sees a "natural
partnership" between art and trash.
   Artists will be paid as much as $2,000 a month for
three-month stints at the dump, owned by Norcal Solid Waste
Systems Inc. Their creations will be made exclusively from
materials plucked from the site, and the finished works will
be displayed there. Norcal's Jacquiline Tripp, who organized
the program, says the artists' efforts will "enhance the
environment for employees" and raise awareness about
recycling. Norcal may someday have a "complete museum on the
property" to showcase the creations, and it hopes to "develop
markets for this artwork."
   The program "brings private industry into a patronage
relationship with an artist in a very organic way," says
Mierle Laderman Ukeles, unpaid artist-in-residence for New
York's Department of Sanitation since 1978. The Norcal
stipend, she says, is "a mark of respect. It shows the artist
is taken seriously." She likens Norcal to "the Medicis."
   "An artist never had it so good to be located at the
dump," says Jo Hanson, a conceptual artist who helped arrange
the San Francisco program. "You have all the materials
available." She once held an exhibition at City Hall of
"things I collected while cleaning up my sidewalk and
street."
   Mr. Wareham, 48 years old, works at a studio on the site.
He says he is only occasionally distracted by the "odor of
garbage decomposing on just the other side of my wall. The
public, he says, often "confuses junk and garbage." He works
only with junk -- pieces of old stoves, car parts, crushed
water heaters and the like -- though he's sure "some
conceptual artist will be hot to work with garbage. Somebody
will want to do a monument of decomposed food. I don't."
   His current assignment may be a perfect fit, Mr. Wareham
says. "Artists love pre-used material with history in it," he
says. And some people "think all abstract art is junk,
anyway."
