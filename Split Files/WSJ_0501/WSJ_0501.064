   WASHINGTON -- Personal spending increased by a moderate
0.4% in March, the Commerce Department reported, as consumers
paid higher prices to keep up with inflation.
   Personal income jumped 0.8%, but much of that stemmed from
a boost in subsidies to farmers; otherwise, the increase was
0.5%.

   Adjusted for inflation, March personal spending dropped by
0.2% after increasing 0.2% in February and remaining
unchanged in January. However, analysts said the low numbers
don't necessarily mean weakness, as they follow a large 0.8%
increase in December. Several analysts said they expect
inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the second quarter to
show monthly increases of 0.2% or 0.3%.
   "I'm still looking for an upward trend in consumer
spending," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "The key to consumer
spending has always been jobs, and they are still expanding."
   In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of
new homes fell 5% in March following a revised 1.5% drop in
February. The March tumble left new-home sales at an annual
rate of 574,000, down from a February rate of 604,000. The
February drop was originally reported as a 3.1% gain. Figures
in both reports are seasonally adjusted.
   "The housing sales numbers look pretty awful," said
Nariman Behravesh, senior vice president at WEFA Group Inc.,
an economic-forecasting company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "We're
seeing further bites in the market because of higher interest
rates, especially for longer-term loans."
   With the increase in personal income outstripping personal
spending, the savings rate increased to 5.8% after rising to
5.3% in February and to 5.2% in January. The savings rate is
personal savings divided by disposable personal income.
   On an inflation-adjusted basis, the biggest drop in
personal consumption was a 1.2% decrease in spending on
durable goods -- items intended to last three years or more.
Spending in that category dropped 2.7% in February. The
Commerce Department said lower auto sales caused both
declines. Higher auto sales spurred by discounting fueled a
6.5% increase in durable-goods spending in January.
   Purchases of nondurable goods also dropped, falling 0.9%
after a 0.7% increase in February. Meanwhile, spending on
services increased 0.6% in March after a 0.7% rise the
previous month.
   The 0.4% increase in personal spending before inflation
adjustment followed a revised 0.6% increase in February. The
February increase had originally been reported as 0.4%. The
0.8% personal-income growth in March followed a revised 0.8%
increase in February, originally reported as 0.9%. The
February figure was also affected by farm subsidies; without
them the rise would have been 0.6%.
   "We've seen continued fairly rapid growth in income," said
Jay Woodworth, senior domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co.
"The numbers continue to make a strong case that the Federal
Reserve may need to reconsider interest-rate policy" and
raise rates slightly to head off inflation, he said.
   Mr. Behravesh concurred, saying WEFA Group expects the Fed
to push the federal-funds rate to about 8.5% later in May and
possibly as high as 9% by the end of the summer. This key
interest rate, which is what banks charge one another on
overnight loans, is currently hovering around 8.25%. "There's
a good deal of underlying strength in the economy, and
inflation isn't going away," Mr. Behravesh said.
