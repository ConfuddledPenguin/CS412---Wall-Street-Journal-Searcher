   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency said it
will issue regulations aimed at reducing the amount of dioxin
that gets into water and soil through the manufacturing of
bleached paper.
   At the same time, however, the agency said the health risk
posed by dioxin in paper products, such as coffee filters,
milk cartons and disposable diapers, is "no cause for alarm."
Instead, the agency referred the food-packaging issue to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will work with the
paper industry to bring these levels down still further.

   Dioxin, a highly toxic chemical and probable human
carcinogen, is a byproduct of the chlorine bleaching process,
which is used to improve products' purity, strength,
absorbency and brightness. The EPA's action, announced at a
press conference yesterday, was required under a consent
decree between the agency and two environmental groups, the
Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife
Federation.
   Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute,
estimated that changes needed to reduce dioxin contamination
will cost about $20 million for each of the 104 mills
nationwide that use the bleaching process. Noting that the
industry has already cut dioxin levels considerably, however,
he said that much of the improvements have already been made.
   Environmentalists are pushing the industry to limit the
amount of bleaching it does and to avoid using chlorine,
wherever possible. The EPA's action "puts the industry on
notice that they've got to keep moving away from the
chlorine-bleaching process," said Karen Florini, a senior
attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund.
   The EPA said it was most worried about the risk to the
small number of generally low-income people who eat large
quantities of carp, catfish and other fish caught in
waterways downstream from paper mills. Deputy EPA
Administrator Hank Habicht said the cancer risk, which could
be greater than one in 1,000 for some subsistence fishermen,
is a "basis for continued aggressive action."
   Working with the states, the agency is trying to identify
"hot spots" where fishing advisories or bans should take
effect.
   Paper mills also are being required to meet new limits on
allowable effluent discharges. In addition, the EPA is
developing new guidelines, expected to be proposed in 1993,
aimed at preventing the dioxin pollution from being created
in the first place.
   Soil contamination will be addressed through new
regulations on dioxin-contaminated waste-water treatment
sludge from pulp and paper mills. Mr. Habicht said about 5%
of such sludge is used as a soil conditioner. The agency also
said it will establish guidelines for managing landfills and
sludge lagoons that contain sludge from mills.
   On packaging, the paper industry said it has already
reduced dioxin in milk cartons to levels that are almost
undetectable. At yesterday's news conference, the FDA said it
would confirm the milk-carton results and work with the paper
institute to make similar changes in other food packaging.
   Mr. Habicht said the risk from the vast majority of
nonfood products such as diapers and tissue was "not a source
of regulatory concern." EPA officials, noted, however, that
reducing dioxin contamination in other areas would cut the
levels in nonfood products as well.
