   Nashua Corp. launched a Dutch auction tender offer for as
many as 2.75 million of its common shares.
   The Nashua, N.H., maker of coated paper and computer
products and photofinishing concern will offer tendering
shareholders a price in the range of $39 to $44 a share. The
company has 9.2 million shares outstanding. In such a Dutch
auction, a company states the number of shares it will buy
during a stipulated period with a price range within which
shareholders can tender their shares. The company will select
a single purchase price within the range to enable it to buy
all the shares it wants.

   Nashua said the offer isn't conditioned on any minimum
number of shares tendered. Funding for the offer is coming
from a portion of the proceeds of the recently completed sale
of the company's international office systems business to
Gestetner Holdings PLC of London. Salomon Brothers Inc. will
manage the offer.
