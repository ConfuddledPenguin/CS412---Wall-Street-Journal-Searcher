   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Norway have resolved a trade
dispute growing out of the Norwegian government's decision
last year to cancel a contract held by Amtech Corp. of Dallas
to supply electronic identification equipment for an Oslo
toll-road project.
   The accord was announced by U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills. An aide to Mrs. Hills said the Norwegian
government agreed to make certain "compensatory" cash
payments to Amtech to offset its financial loss.

   Although the amount wasn't specified in the announcement
of the settlement agreement Amtech said that Norway's
government agreed to pay about 7.1 million kroner, (about
$1.1 million) to it and its Norwegian partner, EB Lehmkuhl
AS, to reimburse costs incurred in the bidding process and in
preparing delivery of the system. Amtech said it received
about $700,000 of the payment, which will be recorded in its
second-quarter results.
   Mrs. Hills said Norway also agreed, in a formal exchange
of letters, to conform with rules of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in all of its future government-procurement
operations. Generally, GATT rules require
"non-discriminatory" procedures in awarding contracts for
government-financed projects.
   The dispute involved equipment that can be used to
automatically read identification markers on cars using a
toll road. The equipment allows toll-road operators to bill
car owners later, rather than having to make them stop and
pay while actually using the roads.
   After the Amtech contract was canceled by the Norwegian
government transport ministry, a similar contract was awarded
to a Norwegian company that had offered to supply toll-road
identification devices manufactured by Siemens AG of West
Germany.
   As a result of the agreement with Norway, Mrs. Hills said
she terminated an investigation of a trade complaint filed by
the Amtech last August under the 1988 trade act and a
complaint the U.S. filed in Geneva against Norway under GATT
dispute-settlement procedures.
