   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Inc. said it had been
granted an extra week to make the next $50 million down
payment toward its $1.27-billion acquisition of MGM/UA
Communications Co.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pathe said
it agreed to make the payment by May 17, rather than May 10.
It is the third of four $50 million payments to be deposited
into an escrow account that MGM/UA could sue to draw from.

   Pathe also said it had extended its tender offer for
MGM/UA until May 10. The $20-a-share offer had been set to
expire yesterday. A Pathe spokesman said the extension was
necessary so that SEC filings could be made.
   Yesterday's filing also said that Luxembourg-based
Comfinance S.A., the closely held main vehicle for Pathe
principal Giancarlo Parretti, had agreed to provide $450
million for Pathe to buy MGM/UA shares, and would receive
about a one-third stake of MGM/UA in return. The filing still
didn't say where Comfinance would get the money, referring
only to "other affiliates" and "European interests."
   As of last Friday, 1.8 million shares of about 53 million
MGM/UA common shares outstanding had been tendered. But Kirk
Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., which along with a Kerkorian
charity own about 82% of MGM/UA common stock, has yet to
tender its shares. The tender offer may again be extended
until June 23.
   Last month, Time Warner Inc. acknowledged that it was
providing a $650-million bridge loan toward the acquisition,
plus another $200 million in film production financing it
said it would help Pathe raise. In return, Time Warner gets a
lien on the UA library and warrants for 20% of the new
company.
   In recent SEC filings, Pathe has indicated it will raise
some of the $450 million by selling certain MGM/UA assets,
like its one-third interest in United International Pictures,
an international film distribution partnership with MCA Inc.
and Paramount Communications Inc. Another possibility
mentioned by Pathe is to sell the foreign home video rights
it holds to the old MGM library, now owned by Ted Turner's
Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   But reports in the trade paper Hollywood Reporter that
MGM/UA's TV division is being pursued by Sony Corp.'s
Columbia Pictures unit were denied. "There's no truth to
this," said MGM/UA TV chief David Gerber.
   An individual close to the situation said Columbia had
been in discussions about acquiring the division several
months ago, before the Pathe bid, but had backed off, and
that Pathe had indicated no willingness to spin off the
division. Mr. Parretti previously had indicated an interest
in television when he was part of a 1988 bid for MGM/UA's TV
unit by Pathe Entertainment President Alan Ladd Jr. and Mr.
Gerber.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, MGM/UA
closed at $18.625, up $1.125.
