   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- International Business Machines Corp.
expects "substantially improved" performance in 1990 and sees
a "very bright" future, a generally upbeat Chairman John
Akers told the annual meeting here.
   Though the remarks didn't go beyond previous statements by
the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant, and Mr. Akers didn't
give a specific forecast of IBM's 1990 results, his
assessment was notable for its unalloyed air of optimism.

   Indeed, following the remarks, IBM shares rose $1.625, to
close at $109, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. The issue was the second-most active on
the Big Board, with volume of more than 1.5 million shares.
   "It didn't sound as if they said anything new," Steve
Milunovich, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp., said.
"But the tone is a little more positive. There's a little
more confidence at the company."
   Mr. Akers conceded that IBM's 1989 business didn't "live
up to our expectations," but he said the company is
encouraged by its healthy first-quarter results. And he
reaffirmed IBM's image of itself as "a growth company," an
image that has been questioned recently by securities
analysts.
   Mr. Akers attributed his confidence in part to the effects
of a 1989 restructuring that resulted in a $2.4 billion
charge against fourth-quarter earnings. He reiterated that
IBM would start to see the full benefit of that action -- $1
billion in annual savings -- in 1991. In 1989, IBM earned
$3.76 billion, or $6.47 a share, on revenue of $62.71
billion.
   He said he expects the industry to continue growing 7% to
10% a year, though this would be substantially less than the
15% annual growth the industry used to enjoy.
   Mr. Akers also said that the company's U.S. operations
will trim 10,000 employees by the end of this year, as
planned, and that IBM employment world-wide will hold steady
or decline from that level in the future.
   In response to shareholder questions, Mr. Akers said IBM
wants to expand its presence in two markets where the company
has fallen down so far: laptop computers and home computers.
He said that IBM wants to be "a much larger participant" in
the laptop market, where it has yet to produce a credible
product, and that it will pursue that segment.
   And while he emphasized that IBM hasn't confirmed media
reports that the company will soon introduce an inexpensive
home computer, Mr. Akers said that some elements of those
reports may be true and that home computers are "a very
attractive opportunity." He added, "We have our eye directly
on the home market."
