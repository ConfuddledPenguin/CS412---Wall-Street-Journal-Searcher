   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is "considering its
options" after unsuccessful attempts to sell two
defense-related subsidiaries, the company said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
   The company said it hasn't received satisfactory offers
for the two units, Electrospace Systems Inc. and Airborne
Systems Inc. The statements came in an amended registration
statement involving its $1 billion bond offering last week.

   A Chrysler spokesman said the company wouldn't elaborate
on possible options. But financial analysts said Chrysler may
decide to wait out current conditions depressing the defense
market in hopes of attracting better offers, or to enter a
joint venture with another company.
   Chrysler's stock price has been sliding lately, but
analysts say the main reason is poor car sales rather than
fruitless efforts to sell the two defense-related companies.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Chrysler closed
Monday at $14.50, down 25 cents.
   The defense and aerospace market turned sour a few months
before December, when Chrysler put up for sale its Chrysler
Technologies unit. That unit includes Electrospace, Airborne
and Gulfstream Aerospace. In March, Chrysler sold Gulfstream,
a manufacturer of commercial aircraft, for $825 million.
Selling the other two units would help raise additional cash
that Chrysler needs in its core automobile business.
   Industry observers say uncertainty about future funding
for defense-related contracts has brought more sellers than
buyers into a depressed market. Ford Motor Co. also is trying
to sell its aerospace operations, but hasn't succeeded so
far.
   "The climate now is like trying to roll a lead ball up the
hill," said Howard Rubel, an aerospace industry analyst at C.
