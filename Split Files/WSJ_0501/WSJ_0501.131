   Veba AG Chairman Klaus Piltz said the West German
chemicals and energy group earned 350 million marks ($208.4
million) on the sale of its 51% holding in Feldmuehle Nobel
AG to Sweden's Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB.
   Mr. Piltz said the total consists of 300 million marks in
profit reflecting the difference between purchase and sales
price of the holding, and an additional 50 million marks in
dividends.

   The Veba chairman said the company is selling the holding
it bought 11 months ago mainly because there isn't enough
synergy between Feldmuehle's main paper business and Veba's
activities. He also cited Feldmuehle 5% limit on individual
shareholders' voting rights as a factor that made taking full
control of the company too expensive.
   Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora Kopparbergs
Bergslags, said Stora will offer 540 Deutsche marks a share
to holders of the remaining 15% of Feldmuehle shares it
doesn't hold. It paid an average of 567 marks a share for
Veba's holdings.
