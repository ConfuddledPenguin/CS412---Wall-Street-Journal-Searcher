   DENVER -- Aircoa Hospitality Services Inc., a hotel
management concern, said it asked the Securities and Exchange
Commission to deregister its common stock, which is traded
over the counter, and to suspend its financial reporting
obligations within 90 days, because the number of its common
stockholders and senior unsecured note holders has fallen
below 300 each.
