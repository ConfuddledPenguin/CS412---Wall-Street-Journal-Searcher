   NEW YORK -- The Consumer Confidence Index in April gave up
the gain it posted in March because of "growing uneasiness
about jobs," said the Conference Board, a nonprofit,
nonpartisan group that compiles the indicator.
   The index fell to 106, a low point for 1990 and down 4.6
points from the revised 110.6 level for March, when the index
rose 3.5 points. The index uses 1985 as a base of 100.

   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Board's Consumer
Research Center, attributed the loss in confidence to
jobmarket concerns. Though the unemployment rate has remained
unchanged at about 5% for months, the number of new jobs
dropped sharply in March.
   In fact, 19.7% of consumers surveyed in March felt
business conditions were "bad," up 1.6 percentage points from
February. In April, that number eased slightly to 19.4%, but
the percentage of respondents who said they felt business
conditions were "good" fell 1.6 percentage points to 23.3%
   And the outlook for the next six months isn't optimistic.
Respondents planning to buy an automobile dropped two
percentage points to 6.1%, and intentions to purchase a home
also were down. Plans to buy appliances were unchanged.
   The monthly survey, covering 5,000 households throughout
the U.S., is conducted for the Board by National Family
Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.
