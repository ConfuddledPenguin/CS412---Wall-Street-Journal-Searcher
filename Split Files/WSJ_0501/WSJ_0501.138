   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Cargill Inc. has been ordered by a
U.S. District Court judge to renew its contract with a
northern Florida chicken grower.
   Under such contracts, Cargill delivers baby chicks to
growers, who raise them and are paid per pound by Cargill for
the weight the chickens gain.

   Cargill quit delivering baby chicks to Arthur Gaskins,
president of the Northeast Florida Broiler Growers'
Association, in August after that group filed a lawsuit
against the big, Minneapolis-based agribusiness concern. That
continuing lawsuit alleges, among other things, that Cargill
underpaid the chicken growers.
   The case was discussed in a page one story in The Wall
Street Journal in January detailing the plight of chicken
growers around the country.
   Mr. Gaskins had petitioned the court for a preliminary
injunction requiring Cargill to continue to do business with
the chicken farmer.
   In his order granting a motion for preliminary injunction,
Judge John H. Moore ruled that Mr. Gaskins and the U.S.
Justice Department, which has joined the ongoing growers'
case, have a substantial likelihood of winning their case on
several claims, including the claim that Cargill terminated
Gaskins in order to discourage growers from supporting the
growers' organization.
   A spokesman for Cargill said the company received the
order late yesterday and "will be studying the next
appropriate action on our part."
