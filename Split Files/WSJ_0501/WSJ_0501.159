   WASHINGTON -- Lebanese Shiite terrorists released the
second American hostage within eight days -- putting new
pressure on President Bush to reciprocate with some gesture
of gratitude toward Iran, which influences or controls the
kidnappers.
   Bush administration officials continued to insist the U.S.
won't improve relations with Iran until all the remaining
hostages are freed. But while ruling out direct American
concessions, there were signs the U.S. wouldn't mind if Iran
reaped some benefits.

   President Bush said: "We cannot have normalcy as long as
any American is held against his will." But he added that
he'd have "no objection" if Israel releases a Shiite cleric
it seized last year, as Iran has demanded. And a senior
official said the administration would be willing to respond
favorably to new Iranian initiatives in negotiations over
freeing its assets frozen in the U.S. or to an Iranian move
to hold direct talks with the U.S. -- even if such responses
are interpreted by others as reciprocation for the hostage
releases.
   The Iranian leadership broke with its past policy and
immediately took direct credit for the freeing yesterday of
hostage Frank Reed by an unknown Lebanese group.
   An editorial in the English-language Tehran Times, which
is often used to communicate the regime's views, asserted
that Iran wouldn't seek further hostage releases unless Mr.
Bush responded first. It asked the U.S. to "pressure" Israel
and its Lebanese allies to free Shiite prisoners.
   In a statement, President Bush publicly thanked Iran and
Syria. Damascus handled the logistics of the release. But
administration spokesmen continued to repeat past statements
asserting that no significant gestures would be made toward
Iran until the remaining six American hostages, and possibly
even 10 other Westerners, are freed.
   A senior State Department official said the U.S. hasn't
any intention of unilaterally releasing frozen Iranian
assets. But, he added, if Iran suddenly softened its terms on
negotiations over the assets, the administration wouldn't
block a resulting asset deal, even though it might be seen as
a payoff for the hostage releases.
   Similarly, he said, if Iran suddenly proposed direct talks
involving "authoritative" representatives of its government,
the U.S. would honor its previous offer to meet, though not
to trade for hostages. Finally, the official said, if Israel
and Iran or the Lebanese groups want to arrange a prisoner
swap, the U.S. wouldn't block it, although he asserted the
administration isn't pressing Israel to do so.
   The official insisted there isn't any evidence that any of
these possible developments is imminent. "There is no
specific thing we're planning to do," he said, adding: "But
we're not going to avoid doing things, if Iran moves the
ball, just because the Iranians might want to interpret them
as gestures by us."
   The Tehran Times editorial complained that the U.S. and
the West didn't reciprocate for the April 22 release of
Robert Polhill. "Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and
the Western countries," it said. The newspaper said an
"appropriate" response would be for the U.S. to "pressure
Israel" and its Christian allies in Lebanon to release "a
significant number" of Lebanese Shiite prisoners, including
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a radical Shiite cleric Israel
seized last summer.
   "Naturally, without an appropriate response from the
West," the editorial said, "there is no chance for the
continuation of Iranian mediation and requests."
   Tehran may be angered by the State Department's annual
report on terrorism, which was issued yesterday. The study
accused Iran of being the "most active state sponsor" of
terrorism last year, saying "the events of 1989 indicated
that Tehran continued to view the selective use of terrorism
as a legitimate tool."
   The report specifically charged that President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who is credited with the recent hostage releases,
publicly "encouraged" the killing of Westerners and the
hijacking of aircraft last year.
   Overall, the terrorism report concluded there had been "a
steep decline" in the number of terrorist acts world-wide
last year. Incidents fell 38% and deaths of innocent victims
fell to 390 from 638 in 1988, when Pan American Flight 103
was blown up.
