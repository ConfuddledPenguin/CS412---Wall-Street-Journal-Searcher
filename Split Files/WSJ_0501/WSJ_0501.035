   SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government
toughened foreign exchange controls again, in a move to
prevent capital flight and excessive spending by overseas
travelers.
   The Ministry of Finance said it will no longer permit
South Koreans to buy up to $5,000 worth of foreign currency
on presentation of their identification cards.
