   First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said it reached an
out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit filed in 1988 against
the company in connection with the investment strategies of
its bond portfolio, a major portion of which was sold in
1988.
   The bank-holding company said the agreement won't result
in a loss to First Bank or a cash benefit to shareholders
other than the six plaintiffs, who will receive "nominal
payments."

   First Bank said its insurance carrier will pay $2.5
million to the company, which will be used primarily to pay
costs associated with the lawsuit.
   As part of the agreement, First Bank said it agreed to add
an outside director who has senior investment-services
experience; revise and formalize guidelines and policies
relating to its remaining bond portfolio; and retain an
independent expert to advise it on the management of the bond
portfolio and balance sheet.
