   Reliance Group Holdings Inc. said it completed the
previously announced sale of its General Casualty Co.
subsidiary to Winterthur Swiss Insurance Co. for $630
million.
   As a result of selling the Sun Prairie, Wis., insurance
company, Reliance said it will post a pretax gain of about
$380 million in the current quarter.

   New York-based Reliance sold General Casualty at nearly
three times its book value. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the
rating service, has said that the sale to the Swiss company
"will strengthen the statutory surplus of Reliance's
insurance operating subsidiaries" and improve its
consolidated financial leverage.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Reliance posted a $6 million
net loss, including an after-tax charge of $8.6 million to
settle lawsuits.
   Reliance shares closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $5.625, up 25 cents.
