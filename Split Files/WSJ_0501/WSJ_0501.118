   WASHINGTON -- The oil-rich government of Abu Dhabi,
effectively taking control of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce
International, is paying a reported $528 million for a 20%
share of the company and will inject another $400 million in
new capital, people close to BCCI said.
   As a result, Abu Dhabi -- and its absolute ruler, Sheik
Zayed al-Nahyan -- will become the majority owner of BCCI,
which earlier this year pleaded guilty in Tampa, Fla., to
laundering more than $14 million of drug profits.

   According to recent estimates, Sheik Zayed and the
state-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Authority together hold
about a third of the closely held bank's stock.
   Luxembourg-based BCCI, which specializes in trade finance
and deposit business, is expected to announce its 1989
results soon. According to individuals close to the bank
holding company, it will report losses as a result of
substantially increased provisions for bad and doubtful
loans.
   Abu Dhabi is apparently paying $40 a share for the 20%
stake currently owned by the Saudi Bin-Mahfouz family,
according to London news agency reports. The $528 million
total cost of the transaction implies that BCCI has 66
million shares altogether, and values the whole company at
$2.64 billion. The Bin-Mahfouz family owns National
Commercial Bank, the largest Saudi Arabian commercial bank.
At one time, the family seemed to have ambitions to turn BCCI
into its international arm.
