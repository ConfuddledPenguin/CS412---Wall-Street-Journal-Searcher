   NEW YORK -- After a quiet winter, things have started
popping in the past two weeks at the Commodity Exchange,
which has been trying to rejuvenate itself.
   -- On Friday, Arnold Staloff, president and chief
executive officer of Comex, resigned effective today after
only nine months on the job.

   -- Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange are
considering pulling out of the common price quotation ticker
of all five New York futures exchanges and creating their own
joint ticker.
   -- Comex lost some trade-processing business it had been
handling for the New York Cotton Exchange, which said it was
going to move trade processing operations to the Board of
Trade Clearing Corp. in Chicago.
   Mr. Staloff's resignation was not unexpected given the
stories that have been coming out of Comex since August 1989
when he took the position. Mr. Staloff was brought in from
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange with considerable fanfare
because of his reputation as a developer of new financial
products such as the first foreign-currency options and a
computerized trading system. New successful products are
considered by many in the industry to be the key to exchange
growth.
   One widely accepted view of Mr. Staloff's resignation was
that he fell victim to a power play by Martin Greenberg, who
was elected chairman of Comex last month and is president of
Sterling Commodities Inc., a futures brokerage firm. But one
Comex member of long standing said Mr. Greenberg doesn't need
a power base because "he knows where all the bodies are
buried."
   Mr. Greenberg said in an interview that he wishes Mr.
Staloff well.
   An officer at another exchange characterized the split
between Messrs. Staloff and Greenberg as a personality
conflict. He described Mr. Staloff as a low-key, soft-spoken,
thoughtful and creative executive. Mr. Greenberg is known for
his outspoken and strongly opinionated personality.
   Others say that Mr. Greenberg simply wanted to put into
the presidency someone he knew and trusted. "It's sad. He
never gave Arnie a chance," commented one member.
   Mr. Greenberg says that Comex staffers are happy and that
his goal is to make the exchange more efficient and
prosperous. On the search for a new president he added,
"There is no shortage of viable candidates from both inside
and outside the exchange."
   Mr. Staloff was criticized for taking credit for things he
did not do at the exchange. For example, one member said Mr.
Staloff was claiming the hand-held trade reporting device
developed at Comex as his. Another questioned Mr. Staloff's
record in creating new products for the exchange.
   Mr. Staloff was not available for comment. However, a
longtime business associate said it would have been
impossible for him to satisfy the exchange's floor traders
because he could never shake the tag of "outsider." Mr.
Staloff "never claimed he invented the hand-held unit, but he
does say he focused attention on it to get it moving."
   This associate also notes that the Comex board at its
April meeting approved the gold asset participation contract.
"This was 100% Arnie's project," says Mr. Staloff's
associate. He notes that if this product is approved by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission it would be the first
traded on a commodity exchange that could be sold by
securities brokers. The GAP is a security-like instrument
designed to appeal to small investors who want to trade gold
without using futures.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Staloff's failure to fit in at
Comex stemmed from the highly charged political atmosphere of
the exchange or the short-term orientation of many member-run
organizations. Tom Walker, a former Comex marketing official
and now president of Creative Marketing Solutions Inc. of
Edison, N.J., observed that "Nothing's changed. The exchange
is driven by locals, and they have no vision." "Locals" are
members of the exchange who trade for themselves on the
floor. They rarely hold market positions for more than a few
minutes.
   Although merger talks between the New York Merc and Comex
resumed Thursday night, two other recent events suggest a
grand merger of all New York futures exchanges might not be a
prospect.
   Since 1977 the five New York commodity exchanges have
pooled their price data on a common ticker. Revenue from the
sale of this data is estimated at around $27 million annually
and is currently divided according to a formula that reflects
equality among exchanges and to a lesser extent volume of
trading.
   The two larger exchanges would like to see ticker revenue
allocated by volume of contracts traded. If a new agreement
cannot be worked out with the other exchanges, Comex and Merc
are considering abandoning the common ticker and offering
their own price data separately or forming a joint ticker.
   Such a move, noted one exchange official, could result in
millions of dollars in increased revenue for the two
exchanges. It would also substantially reduce revenue for the
three smaller exchanges. According to an exchange spokesman,
the new ticker could come about as early as this summer.
   Additional signs of divisiveness came from an announcement
by the New York Cotton Exchange that by Jan. 1, 1991, its
trade processing operations would be handled in Chicago.
Since 1983 the Cotton Exchange's trade processing had been
handled by Comex Clearing Association Inc.
   A Comex official said the Cotton Exchange's decision to
move its trade processing was obviously a business decision.
An official at the Cotton Exchange said that he was surprised
that Comex did not come up with a more competitive price for
trade processing given that "they obviously have excess
capacity." No other New York exchange has indicated that it
will move its trade processing to Chicago.
