   MINNEAPOLIS -- North Star Universal Inc. said it may
consider selling all or part of the company, whose assets
include a majority interest in Michael Foods Inc., to enhance
shareholder value.
   Confirmation that North Star had retained Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. to help explore restructuring options came as the company
announced a more restrictive credit agreement with its
primary lender, First National Bank of Minneapolis.

   Under the new loan, North Star was required to pledge its
53.9% holding of Michael common stock as collateral, along
with all other assets except its real-estate holdings. In
exchange, the bank increased its credit line by $3 million,
to $34 million. Terms now require that the value of the
Michael stock be twice that of the loan, which on the full
loan would mean a price of about $11.62.
   Should the price fall below that level, presumably the
bank would become the largest shareholder in Michael. That
Minneapolis-based company, whose business mix includes eggs,
milk and potatoes, has been a subject of debate on Wall
Street over whether it is primarily a commodity company or a
seller of food technology.
   One analyst predicted yesterday that news of North Star's
possible restructuring would depress Michael's stock. "I
could easily see the stock down in $10 to $12 area," said L.
Craig Carver of Dain, Bosworth in Minneapolis. Accordingly,
he changed his recommendation on Michael to a "sell" from a
"hold."
   Mr. Carver is among those who view Michael as basically a
commodity business that has been overvalued by some
investors. "There's a tremendous commodity influence on this
company, and I don't think it's being recognized," he said,
contending that the recent prices in the shell-egg market are
at a peak from which they won't remain.
   But Dennis Nielsen, director of research at Craig-Hallum
Inc., another Minneapolis brokerage house, said, "We're
coming around to a position that (Michael) is less vulnerable
to the egg and potato business through their value-added
approach." Still, Mr. Nielsen noted yesterday he is "neutral"
on North Star since "they really are very highly leveraged."
   North Star's first-quarter balance sheet shows the company
with $201.6 million in debt and shareholders equity of $36.4
million for a debt-capital ratio of 84.7%. To help finance
operations, North Star sells its own subordinated debentures
in Minnesota. Its new loan agreement discloses that the
company had been in technical default on the previous credit
line with the Minneapolis bank.
   A holding company with interests in graphics, computer
cabling, health-care services and other industries, North
Star wouldn't elaborate on its retention of Goldman, Sachs
other than to say that no decisions have been made on a
specific transaction, nor are there any assurances that any
would occur. Previously, North Star wouldn't comment on
reports that it was retaining an investment banker.
   Meanwhile, Michael Foods has gone elsewhere for its
borrowings. Severing a credit line with First Minneapolis
bank, the potato, egg and milk concern recently lined up a
$45 million revolving loan with Continental Bank N.A. and
Banque Nationale de Paris.
