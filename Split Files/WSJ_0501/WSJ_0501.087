   Two U.S. units of Japan's Nomura Securities Co. are
linking up with quantitative investment specialist Barr
Rosenberg to study ways in which computers can be applied to
managing securities portfolios.
   Shareholders of the new joint venture, Nomura Rosenberg
Investment Technology Institute, will be Mr. Rosenberg,
Nomura Holding America Inc. and Nomura's U.S. research arm.
Mr. Rosenberg, who designs mathematical models to manage
money, will be chairman. The institute will be staffed by
about 10 professionals from Nomura along with Mr. Rosenberg;
it will be located in San Francisco.

   Nomura said that the new institute will do research in
international investment theory, particularly focusing on
ways to use quantitative methods in managing diversified
portfolios, perhaps involving securities denominated in
different currencies and invested in various markets.
   Nomura already has a relationship with Mr. Rosenberg. In
1987, the two teamed up to form Rosenberg Asset Management in
Japan. The concern primarily uses quantitative methods to
manage funds for Japanese investors in the Tokyo market.
Nomura also owns 49% of Rosenberg Institutional Equity
Management Inc. of Orinda, Calif., which manages more than $2
billion of Japanese money in the U.S.
   While small, the new institute is another example of the
growing links between Japanese investors and U.S. portfolio
managers. It also reflects the increasing Japanese interest
in "quantitative" investing, in which funds are invested
according to computer-based models.
   Besides Nomura, Nikko Securities Co., Sumitomo Bank Ltd.,
Orix Corp., Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. all have links with American money
managers. In addition, both Yamaichi Securities Co. and Daiwa
Securities Co. have hired U.S. academics to design
computer-driven investment models for various markets. In the
biggest "quantitative" connection to date, Nikko last June
agreed to pay $125 million for 50% of the money management
unit of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. The deal was completed earlier this
year.

   NOMURA SECURITIES Co., through several units and
subsidiaries, owns 49% of Rosenberg Asset Management, a
venture owned jointly with Rosenberg Institutional Equity
Management of Orinda, Calif. In yesterday's edition, the
relationship was misstated.
