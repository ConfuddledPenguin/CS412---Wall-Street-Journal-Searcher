   KAUFMAN &amp; BROAD HOME Corp. -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said
it lowered its rating on the subordinated debt of this Los
Angeles home builder to double-B-minus from double-B-plus.
About $405 million of face value of zero-coupon debt is
affected. The implied senior debt rating is double-B-plus,
S&amp;P said. The ratings agency attributed the move to weakness
in the U.S. housing market, as well as its expectation that
Kaufman &amp; Broad's leverage will exceed earlier projections.
