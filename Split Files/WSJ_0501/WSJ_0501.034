   SOVIET INFLATION

   Shrinking production, budget deficits and a rapid increase
in the money supply are pushing the Soviet Union to the brink
of out-of-control inflation, a Soviet economist said.
   "The escalating financial crisis took us to the edge
beyond which suppressed inflation will break into the open
regardless of the will of the government or trade unions,"
Yegor Gaidar wrote in the Communist Party daily Pravda.
   Analyzing economic statistics for the first quarter of
1990, Mr. Gaidar wrote that on the open farmers' markets, the
price of meat has increased 16%, the price of vegetables 13%
and the price of fruit 20%. He said the money supply is
growing at a rate six to eight times faster than it was a
decade ago, and production of many capital goods is falling.
   Faith in the Soviet economic structure is so low that
government grain purchases are falling, despite a good
harvest last fall, Mr. Gaidar said. He said farms are holding
onto their grain to barter it for needed goods and services
rather than selling it to the government.
                                                                                                       

   NEW VENTURE IN AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   Two Australian companies and Australia's state-owned
Qantas Airways Ltd. are forming an international management
company. Mayne Nickless Ltd., an Australian transportation
and security company, said it will join P&amp;O Containers Pty.,
an Australian unit of Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation
Co. of Britain, and Qantas to form Global Logistics Services
Pty. The new company will cover air, sea and land
transportation, warehousing, customs handling and inventory
control and management for Australian and international
companies.
                                                                                                       

   WEST GERMANY'S `STRIKES'

   West Germany's largest union staged "warning strikes"
yesterday at plants in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg,
including facilities of Mercedes-Benz, the automobile arm of
Daimler-Benz AG. The union, IG Metall, was pressing its
request for a reduction in the work week to 35 hours from 37
hours and for a 9% pay raise. The employers have offered a 5%
pay cut and said that a work-week reduction would be possible
in future years.
                                                                                                       

   INVESTING IN THE PHILIPPINES
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine Board of Investments has approved
investments amounting to 28.4 billion pesos ($1.28 billion)
during the first quarter of the year, up 14.5% from 24.8
billion pesos of approvals a year earlier. The figures are
encouraging "despite the December coup attempt and the
{ongoing} power shortage," Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion
said. The approvals don't reflect actual investments but
merely indicate the projects deemed by the board as
beneficial for the country's development. Mr. Concepcion said
that when and if actual investments are made, as many as
92,125 jobs could be created.
                                                                                                       

   AID FOR INDIA
                                                                                                       

   Japan has indicated it would pledge a concessional loan of
about 100 billion yen ($628 million) to India in 1991,
representing an increase of 10% over past loans, a Japanese
spokesman said. This was conveyed to Prime Minister V.P.
Singh by visiting Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, the
spokesman said. He said the exact amount of the low-interest
loan will be decided at the June meeting of the Aid India
Consortium. In a speech to the Indian parliament yesterday,
Mr. Kaifu said the time had come for Japan to play a larger
role in Asia through its economic and technological power.
                                                                                                       

   KOREANS IN JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   South Korea and Japan reached agreement on the legal
status of ethnic Koreans living in Japan, clearing the way
for President Roh Tae Woo to visit Japan next month. Mr. Roh
had been under pressure from opposition and human-rights
groups to cancel his trip unless Japan took steps to
guarantee the legal status of the 700,000 ethnic Koreans
living in Japan. A statement said Tokyo will allow third- and
succeeding-generation ethnic Koreans to live in Japan
permanently.
                                                                                                       

   A THORN IN CHINA'S SIDE
                                                                                                       

   A ship planning to beam music, news and pro-democracy
broadcasts to China from international waters off the Chinese
coast is due in Singapore tomorrow, a spokesman for the
project said.
   The 1,200-ton Goddess of Democracy, named after the statue
erected by demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last
spring, sailed from France on March 17. The project is
sponsored by a coalition of groups headed by the French
magazine Actuel. The Chinese government has voiced strong
objections about the ship.
   The spokesman refused to disclose "for security reasons"
when the ship planned to leave Singapore and arrive in Taiwan
for a scheduled refueling stop before starting its
broadcasts.
   China has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
broadcasts and has called Taiwan's plan to help the ship "an
open provocation."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Brazil is dynamiting 110 airstrips in the Amazon jungle.
The project is an attempt to protect the Yanomani Indian
tribe, which has been ravaged by diseases brought into the
jungle by gold prospectors. . . . Information from former
East German intelligence officers has led to the
identification of hundreds of ex-agents in West Germany who
spied for the East. Bonn security sources said efforts would
be made to arrest them all.
