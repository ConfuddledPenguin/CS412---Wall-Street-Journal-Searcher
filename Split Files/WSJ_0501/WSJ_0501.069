   Your April 3 story on psyllium grain's ability to reduce
cholesterol said:
   "But psyllium isn't without controversy. Last year, the
Food and Drug Administration looked into the safety of its
use in large quantities in cereal. In response, General Mills
Inc. took a psyllium-based cereal off the market."

   General Mills actually removed Benefit from test markets
because of disappointing consumer sales.
   General Mills submitted a 1,313-page petition to the FDA
arguing that psyllium as consumed in Benefit cereal is
completely safe and should be declared "generally recognized
as safe" by the agency.
