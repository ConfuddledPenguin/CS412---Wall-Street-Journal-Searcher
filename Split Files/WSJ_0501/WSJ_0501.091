   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Omni Exploration Inc. directors
authorized hiring investment bankers to explore the possible
sale of the company or other transactions that would maximize
shareholder value.
   The market price of the common stock doesn't fairly
reflect the value of Omni's oil and natural gas reserves,
said Gary Novinskie, president.
