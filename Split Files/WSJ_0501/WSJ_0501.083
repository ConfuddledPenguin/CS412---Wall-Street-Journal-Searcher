   New York -- "Spunk," George C. Wolfe's animated adaptation
of three short stories by Zora Neale Hurston, is a happy
exception to the rule that a good read rarely makes a good
show. In this case, the tales project their powerful blend of
pathos and charm both in print and on stage.
   Hurston, the Florida-born, New York-educated writer, is
admired today as an astute chronicler of black life and black
speech in the '30s and '40s. Scorned during her lifetime by
many blacks who considered her to be perpetuating low-life
stereotypes, she died in ignominy in 1960.

   If Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey sang the blues, Zora Neale
Hurston wrote them. "Spunk's" three tales slide up and down
the scale of emotion. Like a good blues number, they're about
ordinary folks and the ordinary tragedies that happen between
men and women. Although they're mostly in a minor key, they
have frequent bursts of gleeful comedy.
   The principal stories are "Sweat" and "The Gilded
Six-Bits." The first is the brutal story of a pious,
hard-working washerwoman trying to shed a no-count, runaround
husband. The betrayal is reversed in the second story, and a
gentle husband must come to terms with his foolish wife's
indiscretion.
   In between comes the merry "Story in Harlem Slang," about
two young men strutting down Lenox Avenue. Both are penniless
and trying to put the make on a savvy domestic who just got
paid. In what must be the ultimate compliment on a lady's
figure, one of the dandies exclaims: "Oooo-eee] The shape you
got on you] I bet the Coca-Cola Company's paying you a lot
for the patent."
   Before the two would-be moochers get their comeuppance,
they primp, preen and prance around stage to the rollicking
tune of their own colorful slang, which is annotated in the
program. One example: "Beatin' up your gums" is translated as
"talking to no purpose."
   Part acted, part narrated and part sung, the three stories
are linked musically. A snappy guitar player and an
expressive blues singer frame the tales in song. They never
leave the stage, but circle round each story's four players,
constantly commenting on the action and occasionally taking
part.
   It's probably unfair to single out any member of the cast
since all six are so good, but I can't resist mentioning one:
Reggie Montgomery has a villainous charm as the abusive
husband in "Sweat." His flashy smile and flirtatious tilt of
the head are simultaneously beguiling and sinister. In
"Harlem Slang," he's the model coxcomb as he shows off his
zoot suit in a breezy gravity-defying strut.

   Hurston's Harlem is a far cry from that of "Mama, I Want
to Sing -- Part II," the continuation of the story of Doris
Winter, a Gospel singer turned pop star. In the sequel, based
loosely on the life of Doris Troy (who plays the mother
here), Doris (D'Atra Hicks) juggles the demands of marriage
and motherhood as her singing career takes her round the
world. She finally decides she'd rather be on Lenox Avenue
than on the Ginza.
   The plot, the dialogue and the acting are all pretty thin,
but the spirited music happily makes up for what they lack.
All the voices are strong and the church choir, played by the
New York Reach Ensemble, is a delight. When they unleash
their voices, pure joy escapes. The choral celebration is led
by Charles Stewart, in "real" life an English teacher at a
Newark, N.J., high school. As the lightfooted minister of
music, he shimmies and shakes his way through the Gospel
tunes with an exuberance that matches that of the choir.

   You'd think the life of Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas would make good theater. It's heartwarming: The poor
son of a preacher from a small town in the Pacific Northwest
breaks into the Eastern Establishment and, as liberal gospel
would have it, becomes the ardent defender of free speech in
the highest court in the land. There's adventure too: He
climbs the Himalayas and drives cross Persia. There's even
romance: He marries four women.
   All these elements make their way into "Mountain," Douglas
Scott's homage to the nation's longest-serving justice. But
it's all as untidy as one of Justice Douglas's famous sloppy
opinions, and it's about as much fun as watching the
recitation of a court brief. To indicate how platitudinous
and dull the script is, suffice it to say that some of
Douglas's better lines carry a touch of legalese, as if they
were lifted from the justice's decisions.
   Len Cariou makes a valiant effort as Douglas, who is
written as a saint at every age -- from childhood through
dotage. The opening scene, which takes place just before his
death, finds him on the floor trying to crawl up a wall he
mistakes for a mountain. "I don't need your help. I'm doing
it myself," he shouts. This is supposed to project Douglas's
indomitable individualism. Self-centeredness is more like it,
however, and Douglas's pious whining -- about his wives, his
fellow justices, his presidents, his mountains -- isn't
enough to build a character an audience can care about. Even
when discussing some of his famous opinions -- on the right
to contraception or the unconstitutionality of interring
Japanese-Americans during World War II -- he sounds more
petulant than judicial.
   John C. Vennema and Heather Summerhayes, dressed in sober
suits, play all the "memories," of which there are 25 or so,
including Nixon, FDR, Louis Brandeis, Mom, Dad and the four
wives. The two change roles about every other minute, which
is terribly confusing. Is the guy in the suit Harry Truman or
Douglas's neglected son? The best that can be said about this
guessing game is that it is at least a distraction from the
sanctimonious hagiography of a singularly unlikable man.
