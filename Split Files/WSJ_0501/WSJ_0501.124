   DEERFIELD, Ill. -- As the world's largest hospital
supplier, Baxter International Inc. was sorely tempted by the
Middle East's rich and growing health-care market. Increasing
the company's global business was a top priority for
ambitious Vernon R. Loucks, who became chief executive
officer of Baxter in 1980, and the Middle East market seemed
destined over the years to produce sales in the billions of
dollars.
   But for Baxter, the door was slammed shut. In 1971, Baxter
had built a plant in Israel to synthesize intravenous body
fluids, and since the mid-1970s had been on the Arab League's
blacklist of corporations that do business with Israel. If
Baxter were to sell the plant for the purpose of getting off
the Arab blacklist, the company would violate American
anti-boycott law.

   Then last year, apparently out of the blue, Baxter seemed
to get lucky. By doing nothing more than agreeing to a joint
venture with a Syrian government agency to build an
intravenous fluids plant in Syria, the company insists, it
was removed from the blacklist.
   Was it mere coincidence that the previous year, without a
public announcement, Baxter sold its plant in Israel? Baxter
insists it was. It says it had been trying to rid itself of
the plant for years for economic reasons having nothing to do
with the Arab boycott. The plant, Baxter says, was simply a
loser.
   At first, pro-Israeli groups that monitor the compliance
of corporations with American anti-boycott law seemed willing
to accept Baxter's explanation. But they are no longer.
   In February, Baxter directors received a copy of an
explosive memorandum allegedly on file in the Arab League's
boycott office in Damascus. The memorandum was sent to the
directors by a disgruntled former Baxter executive in the
Middle East, Dr. Richard Fuisz, a physician and Washington,
D.C., businessman. The memorandum suggests a hitherto
unacknowledged connection between the sale of the Israeli
plant and the Arab League's delisting of Baxter. Dr. Fuisz
provided The Wall Street Journal a copy of the memorandum and
other documents dealing with Baxter's involvement in the
Middle East.
   According to the boycott committee memorandum, Baxter
itself requested removal from the blacklist through its Swiss
subsidiary, Baxter AG. In support of the request, Baxter's
International Medical Technologies subsidiary in the Middle
East supplied the Arab boycott committee detailed
documentation on the Israeli plant sale and even promised not
to deliver Israel modern technology or do any other business
with it, the memorandum says.
   Baxter's senior vice president and general counsel, G.
Marshall Abbey, says the company hasn't violated the law. He
confirms, however, that the audit committee of the Baxter
board of directors has commissioned a lawyer from the New
York firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft to conduct an
independent investigation. The Commerce Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission are reviewing Baxter's
Middle East activities. Neither will comment on the matter.
   Influential Jewish leaders who have learned of the affair
are demanding a full accounting from Baxter. The
circumstances "raise serious questions about the process
Baxter went through" in getting off the Arab blacklist, says
Jess N. Hordes, Washington director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith. Mr. Hordes wrote Baxter's Mr. Loucks
a letter on April 6 inquiring about evidence suggesting that
Baxter cooperated with the Arab boycott. Mr. Abbey reiterated
in a letter last week that the sale of the Israeli plant was
unrelated to its blacklisting; Mr. Hordes in turn says he
still isn't satisfied.
   Baxter insists that it never contacted the boycott
committee to request removal from the blacklist. Mr. Abbey
says International Medical Technologies never supplied any
information directly to the boycott committee. He also says
Baxter never under any circumstances "made a promise not to
get involved in Israel" in the future.
   The anti-boycott law was enacted in 1977 to discourage
corporations from continuing to seek Arab business with
promises to avoid commerce with Israel. Some companies had
even refused to deal with other American firms that were on
the Arab blacklist, strengthening the boycott. Former
President Jimmy Carter had called the situation "a disgrace."
   The law forbids American companies to participate in any
foreign boycott and requires the public disclosure of any
requests to cooperate with any boycott and of any acts of
compliance. It also forbids companies to supply blacklist
officials any information that demonstrates cooperation with
the boycott.
   Because of the law, some blacklisted companies have simply
abandoned pursuit of the Middle Eastern market. Others --
among them Coca-Cola Co. -- have gradually won access to
markets in moderate Arab League nations without halting
dealings with Israel. But the incentive to find loopholes in
the law has been strong.
   "Large corporations are on the horns of a dilemma," says
E. John Keller, a consultant in international asset
protection and risk assessment in Southlake, Texas. "If they
believe the Arab market is a lot larger than the Israeli
market -- and most of them do -- they will go that route. Yet
they are concerned," he says, about violating anti-boycott
laws or offending supporters of Israel in the U.S. "It's a
difficult line for U.S. companies to walk," he says.
   Being shut out of the Middle East market, enriched by the
oil boom of the 1970s and eary 1980s, was painful for Baxter.
The Middle East promised rich rewards for a hospital supplier
with an early foothold in the region, and Baxter wanted to be
that company. But thanks to the blacklist, every Baxter
initiative in the region turned to sand.
   In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom Inc., a New York
manufacturer of hospital-employee training materials that had
close relations with Saudi Arabia, for $53 million. Despite
the blacklist, Baxter hoped to use the company's connections
to sell all kinds of medical supplies in that kingdom.
   "As it turned out," Baxter later said in documents filed
in a legal case, it "could not do so." After losing money on
Medcom for more than a year, Baxter executives were told by
Saudi officials to "stop wasting their time" in the Middle
East, according to a Baxter document. Baxter sold Medcom in
1986 for just $3.77 million, or 7% of what it had paid for
the company. "The deal from hell," a lawyer who researched
the transaction characterized it.
   Worse yet, Baxter's biggest acquisition ever, its $3.8
billion purchase of American Hospital Supply Corp. in 1985,
was also bruised by the blacklisting. American Hospital's
business in Saudi Arabia dried up as soon as Baxter bought
the company.
   The source of all the trouble was just one among dozens of
facilities that Baxter operated around the world, a small
intravenous fluids plant in Ashdod, Israel. Building the
plant "seemed like a good idea at the time," says Mr. Abbey,
but it was only occasionally profitable. In 1980, Baxter
says, it began seeking a buyer. Mr. Abbey says Commerce
Department officials at the time told Baxter that a sale
wouldn't violate the anti-boycott law. The Commerce
Department won't comment.
   There was talk among Baxter employees in the U.S. and the
Middle East that Baxter wanted to dump the plant to expand
elsewhere in the Middle East. One of those who heard the talk
was Ghazi Braiche, a former employee of Saudi Medical
Services Ltd., a firm that had served as Saudi agent for a
Baxter subsidiary. "I said, `That's practically impossible to
do (under the law),'" Mr. Braiche recalls telling a Saudi
Medical executive. "How can you hide such a transaction?'"
   Baxter's talks with a prospective buyer for the Israeli
plant fell through around 1983. Discussions about a possible
joint venture with the Israeli government also failed, Mr.
Abbey says. Mr. Loucks met with the Israeli prime minister at
the time, Menachem Begin, to tell him why Baxter wanted out
of Israel, "but Begin was beating him over the head to get us
to export. We just couldn't do it," Mr. Abbey says, because
the Israeli plant's production costs were too high. "By 1985
or 1986," he says, "it was my conclusion that we would always
have an Israeli subsidiary, whether we wanted to or not."
   Another thing seemed clear: If Baxter were ever to win
delisting, Arab officials would demand proof that the Israeli
subsidiary had been sold.
   Nazir Sinan, a prominent Damascus attorney and specialist
in boycott affairs, appeared at Baxter headquarters in this
quiet Chicago suburb on a spring day in 1985. Although Mr.
Abbey says Mr. Sinan was uninvited, he managed to see Mr.
Abbey and discuss delisting. "My recollection is that I said,
`Don't call me, I'll call you,'" Mr. Abbey says. He says that
Saudi Medical Services sent Mr. Sinan to Deerfield. Ahmed
Al-Sanousi, president of Saudi Medical Services at the time,
won't comment.
   In any case, Mr. Sinan later wrote to Mr. Abbey to outline
the steps Baxter must take to get off the blacklist. "It is
imperative," one letter said, that a sales contract for the
Israeli operations "should provide that your company has sold
the factory and has terminated fully and finally its legal,
technical, scientific, financial, labor and consultative
relations" with Israel. There's no evidence that Baxter
pursued the matter further with Mr. Sinan. But the next year,
1986, Mr. Abbey flew to Damascus to explore a joint venture
with Syria.
   American law doesn't prevent a U.S. company from getting
off the blacklist by investing in an Arab country. The
trouble can lie in getting the Arab League to agree that the
investment alone is sufficient to remove the U.S. company
from the blacklist.
   Syria, at first glance, wouldn't seem to offer a
hospitable entry. It takes an especially hard line toward
Israel and has tolerated anti-Western terrorist groups. Its
economy, a socialist thicket penetrated mostly by
multinational oil companies, makes profit from any joint
venture questionable at best. A severe foreign-exchange
shortage, steep inflation and dubious public-health
conditions had kept many of Baxter's competitors away.
   But Syria, as one of the Arab League boycott committee's
toughest members, is also one of its most influential. And
Mr. Abbey had a card to play: an offer of Baxter capital and
expertise in building a Syrian intravenous fluids plant, the
kind of facility seen critical to national security in the
war-torn Middle East -- and the kind of facility Baxter had
tried to sell in Israel.
   After "some false starts," Mr. Abbey says, Baxter
ultimately found a joint-venture partner, the General
Establishment for Blood and Medical Industries, which
supplies military and civilian hospitals. Last year, Baxter
and Syria reached a general agreement for Baxter to build the
plant in return for payment in Syrian pounds and part of the
plant's production. Terms of the agreement, highly favorable
to Syria, were finally completed on April 9.
   Coincidentally, Baxter says, in 1988 the same potential
buyer that had lost interest in the Israeli plant in 1983
contacted Baxter again. Soon after, Baxter sold the plant to
the Israel concern, Teva Pharmaceuticals, for a price under
$20 million, Baxter says. Baxter had stopped referring to the
Israeli plant in its yearly Form 10-K reports to the SEC
beginning in 1986. Its 1985 acquisition of American Hospital
Supply made Baxter so large, the company says, that the
finances of so small an operation as the Israeli plant were
no longer material.
   Last fall, while terms of the Syrian joint venture were
still being negotiated, the boycott committee in Damascus
removed Baxter from the blacklist. The company won the
unusual distinction of being sponsored by Syria. In the U.S.,
watchdog groups began almost immediately to question the
circumstances surrounding Baxter's delisting. The company
asserted its innocence. In a letter, Mr. Abbey assured the
American Jewish Congress that the Israeli plant sale and the
delisting were unrelated.
   The Boycott Law Bulletin, a newsletter published in
Houston that monitors anti-boycott law compliance, wrote that
Baxter had made "no overt or covert effort of any kind" to be
removed from the blacklist, adding in a headline that Baxter
was delisted "without even trying." Baxter confirmed the
account, attributing its delisting to its Syrian joint
venture.
   Although the Commerce Department and the SEC continued to
study Baxter's removal from the blacklist, the matter seemed
to rest -- until Dr. Fuisz sent his package of documents
along with a cover letter to Baxter directors on Feb. 2.
   Dr. Fuisz, a founder and former chief executive officer of
Baxter's Middle Eastern Medcom subsidiary, had been ousted
from his job and demoted in 1982. He filed a wrongful
termination and defamation suit against Baxter in federal
court in New York in 1985. During the litigation Baxter and
Dr. Fuisz each accused the other of improper payments or
gifts to influential Saudi Arabian businessmen and government
officials in attempts to win Middle Eastern sales or to get
off the Arab blacklist. None of the allegations were proven
or disproven.
   In a settlement, Baxter gave Dr. Fuisz an $800,000,
five-year consultancy. But Dr. Fuisz remains bitter toward
Baxter and unhappy with the outcome of the litigation.
   Dr. Fuisz says he spent about $35,000 to send an agent to
Damascus to obtain the Arab League memorandum last year. He
says the agent used $10,000 to pay a boycott office employee
to permit the copying of the memorandum, which Dr. Fuisz says
was considered secret. Why did Dr. Fuisz go to all this
expense and trouble? "I didn't do it for money," he says. "I
did it because -- it may sound dumb, but it's the way I feel
about it -- I feel like I went to a Western movie and the bad
guys won. I hang with it because I want the Western movie to
turn out right."
   "We are looking at it," John J. Louis, head of Baxter's
audit committee and former American ambassador to Great
Britain, says of the memorandum. As for the implications of
the document, he says, "We don't know enough to say for sure
(what they are)."
   Without being specific, Mr. Abbey says the document
contains "a number of things that are just factually wrong."
But he acknowledges "some connection between the subjects
referred to in (the memorandum) and materials I furnished our
joint-venture partner" in Syria. If such a partner gave the
boycott committee the anti-Israel assurances described in the
memorandum, rather than Baxter itself, Baxter's conduct might
escape sanctions under the "local law exception" to U.S.
anti-boycott regulations. To determine whether an incident
qualifies as a local-law exception, a Commerce Department
official says, the circumstances "must be examined very
closely."
   While the Commerce Department won't discuss its probe of
Baxter, it acknowledges that determining a company's
motivation in the divestment of Israeli operations is
difficult. "If the company did it because of the boycott,
that would constitute a violation" of the law, a department
official says. "But if they did it for legitimate business
reasons, it's not illegal. Obviously, we would have an
evidence problem . . . in any effort to determine what their
motives were."
   Whatever the legal resolution of the affair, Baxter stands
to take its lumps from anti-boycott groups. The civil fines
typically imposed by the Commerce Department for anti-boycott
violations seldom are large enough to punish large
corporations. "The real strength of U.S. anti-boycott law,"
says Joe Kamalick, editor of the Boycott Law Bulletin, "is
the power of public disapproval."
   American firms, he says, "really hate being connected in a
public way with any questions about anti-boycott violations."
