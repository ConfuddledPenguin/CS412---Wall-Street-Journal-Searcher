   The times must really be a-changin' if the student riot at
California Polytechnic State University is any indication.
Crowds attracted to the school's Poly Royal festival got
carried away with their revelry, at one point attacking a
liquor store and shouting, "Free beer] Free beer]" Police
arrested about 110 students. Political demonstrations may be
fading, but the return of the beer riot doesn't quite suggest
that civilization is moving forward again on campus yet.
