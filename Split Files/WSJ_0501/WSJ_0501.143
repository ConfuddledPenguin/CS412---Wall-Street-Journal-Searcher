   Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman Inc. reported a net loss for the
third quarter ended March 31 of $32.4 million, or $1.77 a
share, widened from a net loss of a $5.2 million, or 29 cents
a share, in the year-earlier period.
   The loss in the latest quarter included $20.4 million, or
$1.12 a share, in pretax one-time charges related to laying
off 300 workers, and scaling down its communications and
advanced computers units. The Cambridge, Mass., concern said
its software and technology divisions remain profitable.

   The widened loss came on a 13% revenue decline, to $64.9
million from $74.5 million. A spokesman said the decline
reflected the end of funding from a limited partnership and
the end of a Delta Airlines contract held by a now-defunct
subsidiary. He said those factors "didn't affect" the
bottom-line losses.
   Stephen R. Levy, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that Bolt Beranek's "poor operating performance over the
past 18 months" reflects slower defense spending and
increased competition in the computer industry.
