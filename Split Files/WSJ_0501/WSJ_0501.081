   DALLAS -- The Texas banking crisis has been an auction
aficianado's dream as thrifts, banks and the federal
government have used the auctioneer's gavel to close sales of
land, houses, cars and antiques.
   Now brave bidders can go for actual loans. NCNB Texas
Corp., a unit of NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., said
yesterday that it will auction $260 million of small
commercial and consumer loans that the bank has already
charged off.

   The loans, inherited by NCNB Texas from the banking units
of First RepublicBank Corp., will be auctioned May 30 in
about 40 portfolios packaged by market, such as Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio and Austin.
   The auction, a first for NCNB Texas, is patterned after
Bank of America's sale last July of $35 million in
credit-card debt. Since then, the auctioneers who handled the
sale, Ross-Dove Co. of Foster City, Calif., have wielded the
gavel in another credit-card debt sale for a private
collection agency and in two auctions of mixed loans for the
Federal Deposit Insurance Co.
   Unlike most loan auctions, which are conducted by sealed
bid with minimum bid amounts set by the sellers, these are
"open-cry" auctions with no minimums, said Ken Fisher,
regional vice president of Ross-Dove.
   Mr. Fisher said the sellers have collected as little as
one-tenth of 1% on the principal amount of the debt, or loans
to as much as 80% of the principal.
