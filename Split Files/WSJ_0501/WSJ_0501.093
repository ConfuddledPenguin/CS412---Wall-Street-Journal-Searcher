   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, clearing the way for
California to challenge the merger of two major supermarket
chains, ruled that federal courts have broad powers to
dismantle anticompetitive mergers in lawsuits by states or
private citizens.
   The 9-0 decision substantially increases the risks to
companies involved in mergers that their deals won't succeed
because of court challenges. The ruling is likely to prompt
firms to cooperate more fully with state attorneys general
than in the past.

   In practical terms, the ruling means that California
officials may proceed with their suit to block permanently
the takeover of Lucky Stores Inc., once the largest
supermarket chain in the state, by American Stores Co., which
owns Alpha Beta Stores Inc., another large chain.
   The $2.5 billion merger was completed on paper in June
1988. But American Stores has been forced to continue
operating the two chains separately during the state's suit
because of a federal court order. Now the case will be
returned to a federal court in Los Angeles for a trial to
decide whether the merger, which state officials charge is
anticompetitive, should be permanently dismantled by court
order.
   Antitrust law experts said the ruling will have a broad
impact beyond the California dispute. "This is the most
important antitrust ruling in a long time," says Joe Sims, a
lawyer here. "For mergers, where certainty has a lot of
value, this is a big problem," he said.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who hailed
the Supreme Court ruling, said the decision firmly
establishes the right of states to enforce their own
antitrust laws, whether the federal government is willing to
or not. Mr. Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, has campaigned long and hard
against the merger of American Stores and Lucky Stores.
   Lucky Stores, Dublin, Calif., declined to comment on the
ruling. Salt Lake City-based American Stores said, "No final
determination has been made that American's acquisition of
Lucky violated any laws, and American intends to vigorously
defend its position."
   Analysts said the decision clouds the American Stores
acquisition of Lucky even more now, raising concerns about a
complete divestiture of Lucky. Previously, the investment
community thought a worst-case scenario might have American
operating its Alpha Beta Stores and Lucky stores
independently, analysts said.
   At the least, analysts said, it was likely that American
Stores, in a settlement, might be forced to undertake an
asset sale to pare down its Lucky holdings to satisfy Mr. Van
de Kamp. That could hurt American, some analysts said, if the
sale included highly profitable Lucky Stores outlets. "This
thing could drag on for some time," said Edward Comeau, an
analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   After the ruling yesterday, American Stores fell $1.75 to
close at $63.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The ruling, written by Justice John Stevens, clarifies an
important step in the detailed framework of federal antitrust
law. Federal law allows the federal government to prosecute
criminal antitrust violations or to sue companies for damages
and to stop them from engaging in civil violations. This
authority for the federal government includes the power to
ask a federal court to require a company to divest itself of
assets obtained in a merger.
   Federal law also allows private citizens or businesses
hurt by anticompetitive conduct, as well as states
representing their residents, to sue for damages caused by
antitrust violations or to try to block mergers before they
take place. Damages may be tripled in state or private
antitrust lawsuits.
   But yesterday, the high court ruled for the first time
that antitrust law gives federal courts the power to order
divestiture in a merger in a lawsuit filed by a state or
private party; this may include a merger that has been
approved by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade
Commission. Allowing such lawsuits by states or private
parties for divestiture is consistent with Congress's "clear
intent to encourage vigorous private litigation against
anticompetitive mergers," Justice Stevens wrote.
   In American Stores' bid for Lucky Stores, the FTC staff
reviewed the merger and proposed to modify it, to which
American Stores agreed. Until those modifications could be
implemented and while the consent order was being reviewed by
the FTC commissioners, the FTC staff required American to
operate the Lucky and Alpha Beta chains separately.
   Meanwhile, California officials, arguing that the merger
would cost consumers $400 million annually in higher prices,
sued in federal court. A federal judge found the merger
anticompetitive based on his initial review of the case
before trial and issued a preliminary injunction ordering
American Stores to continue to run the two chains separately
while the case was pending.
   But a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in
March 1989 that the district court's order had the same
effect as requiring divestiture of Lucky Stores by American
Stores. The appeals court said federal courts may require
divestiture only in lawsuits brought by the government.
   Reversing the appeals court decision, the high court said
the district judge had the authority to order the chains to
operate separately during the appeals and may dismantle the
merger in the future if it is finally determined to be
anticompetitive.
   Last August, after the appeals court ruling, American
Stores proposed to complete the physical merging of the two
chains' operations, but Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor
issued a stay that has required the separate operations to
continue to the present.
   In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Business Roundtable
said it was "seriously concerned" about the "high level of
uncertainty" that would be caused by lawsuits for
court-ordered divestiture.
   Mr. Sims said one effect of the ruling may be that
companies start providing detailed background and statistical
information to justify mergers to states at the same time
they provide it to the federal government. Many companies
have resisted sharing this type of data with state antitrust
enforcement officials. (California vs. American Stores Co.)
