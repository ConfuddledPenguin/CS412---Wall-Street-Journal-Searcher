   NEW YORK -- Concern about labor trouble in West Germany
weakened the mark against the dollar and other currencies
amid dealings made sluggish by the observance of the Greenery
Day holiday yesterday in Japan and the impending May Day
holiday today in Europe.
   Selling of marks was sparked by news of warning strikes
yesterday by some members of West Germany's IG Metall, the
metal workers union. The news combined with other
developments supporting the Swiss franc and the British pound
to give the mark greater losses against those currencies than
against the dollar, participants said.

   The dollar, which gained only slightly against the mark,
failed to capitalize strongly on the mark's weakness because
of general reluctance in the market to take new positions
during the holiday period, traders said. Japanese markets
also will be closed Thursday and Friday.
   In the absence of the Japanese, the U.S. unit remained
static against its Japanese counterpart, spending most of the
day in a band near 159 yen.
   The holiday slowdown also coincided with the end of the
month, catching many participants at a time when their
business for April has been concluded, noted Clement Cypra,
chief dealer at Creditanstalt Bankverein in New York.
   "People are waiting for the Europeans and Japanese to come
back in on Wednesday," Mr. Cypra commented.
   Because of reluctance to act until tomorrow, the market
showed little reaction to yesterday's announcements of U.S.
personal income and single-family home sales data for March,
Mr. Cypra said. Figures showed a 0.8% rise in U.S. personal
income, against a pre-announcement expectation of a 0.5%
gain, and a 5% fall in new single-family home sales to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000, against an
expectation of a rate of 615,000.
   Although the rise in personal income was seen as positive
for the U.S. economy, the market is more interested in
today's release of the National Association of Purchasing
Management's April survey and Friday's report on U.S.
employment data for April, said Thomas Benfer, senior
marketing representative at Bank of Montreal in New York.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6796 marks, up from 1.6775 marks late Friday, and at
158.90 yen, down from 159.30 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6408, up from $1.6350 Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 159.05 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about
1.6806 marks.
   The economic reports released yesterday weren't expected
to have any bearing on the Federal Reserve Bank's monetary
policy, traders said.
   In activity made up mostly of non-dollar transactions,
traders said the Swiss franc showed a firm tone against the
dollar, mark and other currencies because of Switzerland's
attractive political and economic stability, high interest
rates and a perception in the market that participants have
heretofore been underinvested in the currency. The mark fell
to about 0.86509 Swiss franc from 0.8662 franc Friday in New
York.
   Sterling edged higher against the dollar, mark and other
currencies. The British unit was underpinned by participants
who held on to long positions so as to avoid the cost of
keeping short positions while British interest rates are at
15%, said Mark Morris, a corporate foreign exchange dealer at
Lloyd's Bank in New York.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $368.40 an ounce, down $2.70. The close
was the lowest since March 26. Estimated volume was a
moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $360.15 an ounce.
