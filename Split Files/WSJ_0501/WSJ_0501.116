   Switzerland-based Nestle S.A., the world's biggest food
concern, said as expected that it will withdraw a proposed
capital increase, citing "the deteriorated situation on the
stock market."
   The 1-to-20 rights issue of registered shares, through
which Nestle had hoped to increase its capital to about 364.9
million Swiss francs ($250.8 million) from 346.5 million
francs, wouldn't have improved the company's financial
structure, under current market conditions, Nestle said.

   Nestle in late March said it would complete the capital
increase only "if the stock exchange conditions are
favorable." Nestle's withdrawal move follows decisions by
several other large Swiss companies, including Ciba-Geigy AG
and Alusuisse Lonza Holding AG, to cancel or postpone their
capital increases.
   Analysts and stockbrokers have been highly critical of the
number of planned capital increases announced by Swiss
companies in recent months, saying they were depressing an
already sluggish market.
