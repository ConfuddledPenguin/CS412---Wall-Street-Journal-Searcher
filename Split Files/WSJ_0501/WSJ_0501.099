   WASHINGTON -- Bernard Hofmann, owner of a small
Pennsylvania manufacturing company, bounces toward the exit
of the tour bus as it stops on Capitol Hill.
   "OK, you paratroopers," he says to other passengers. "Hit
that rip cord and move on out the door."

   Mr. Hofmann is part of the increasing invasion of
small-business owners who come here to personally buttonhole
members of Congress and their staffs on legislation that
means money for their firms.
   The personal touch is paying off. Last fall,
small-business owners led the successful fight to repeal the
complex Section 89 tax rule that required all companies to
offer comparable benefits to higher and lower-paid workers --
a law small companies found especially burdensome.
   "I'd never seen anything like the turnout for Section 89,"
says Glenn LeMunyon, a House Appropriations Committee staff
member for Rep. Tom LeMay, a Texas Republican. The
small-business lobby, he says, "has the potential to be far
greater than the labor lobby. Business owners are really
paying attention {to politics} now that they know they can be
successful."
   Rep. Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, adds: "It
absolutely means a lot more to know what's happening to an
individual business." He says he wasn't aware that businesses
such as gas stations had a problem insuring underground
storage tanks until small-business people brought it to his
attention. "Some of them get very personal about it, like
saying, `This will cost me $25,000, and I don't make that
much, so you better pay attention,'" Rep. Bunning says.
   Labor lobbyists, who often find themselves opposing
small-business forces on Capitol Hill, call the
small-business agenda one-sided. "It's called selfishness;
they're not looking at the needs of the workers they employ,"
says Robert McGlotten, head of government relations for the
AFL-CIO. And small-business's refusal to compromise on issues
such as Section 89 could eventually backfire with some
lawmakers, a House Ways and Means staffer says.
   For now, however, small-business organizations are
capitalizing on the willingness of business owners to get
involved. The National Federation of Independent Business,
the largest small-business group with nearly 600,000 members,
several years ago adopted the computer targeting techniques
of political campaigns to organize its membership into a
lobbying force. Interest has grown so much that chief
lobbyist John Motley says, "My problem now is to keep them
all happy and working."
   The National Restaurant Association says that in the past
two years its network of members willing to lobby has grown
to about 1,100 people from about 150. "There's been an
upsurge of interest in doing this kind of thing now that
people know they can accomplish something," says spokesman
Jeffrey Prince.
   Judy Meador, a corporate planning consultant and officer
at Print St. Louis Inc., made separate trips here with three
different groups to lobby. "Calls and letters help, but the
ideal is person-to-person contact, particularly when someone
is straddling the line," she says.
   The business people also get attention from the executive
branch. National Small Business United and the National
Association of Women Business Owners will hold a joint
meeting here early this month to focus on health-care costs
and deficit reduction. President Bush will address them, and
they also expect to hear from Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Trade groups have begun programs to formally advise
business owners how to be effective lobbyists. At a Small
Manufacturers Forum, part of the National Association of
Manufacturers, the phenomenon is described as "retail
lobbying" -- stressing how legislation affects one business
in a congressional district, as opposed to the "wholesale,"
or big-picture, lobbying the association does.
   At the forum, officials of small manufacturers get tips on
the tools of lobbying -- such as flattery. A lobbyist, they
are told, can't "overstroke" a legislator. And former
Pennsylvania Rep. Tom Dougherty advises: "Make the
relationship ongoing; do things {for the lawmaker} when you
don't need something."
   After being briefed on the latest issues, the business
people head to Capitol Hill to lobby. Mr. Hofmann stops by
the offices of his Pennsylvania lawmakers. "I'm drowning in
costs and you throw me a brick," he complains at the office
of GOP Sen. John Heinz about proposals to require health
insurance for all employees, including part-time workers.
   Health insurance rates for full-time workers at his
company, Hofmann Industries, which makes steel tubing,
increased 18% last year, Mr. Hofmann says. A Heinz aide
quickly assures him that the senator opposes any health plan
that doesn't strictly control costs.
   The business owners stress how regulations can put a
disproportionate cost burden on small businesses, says
Richard Kubach, the owner of Philadelphia's Melrose Diner who
finds himself visiting Washington more often these days to
lobby. "I'm losing an awful lot of time from my business, but
my viewpoint now is I can't afford not to do it," says Mr.
Kubach, who's fighting bills to require employer-paid health
insurance, although he already offers it to his full-time
workers.
   Some seasoned small-business activists say a few small
companies that are both financially secure and aware of the
importance of national issues still do the most lobbying.
But, increasingly, newcomers are joining the parade.
   David Pinkus, president of North Haven Gardens, a Dallas
landscaping concern, says he now comes here to lobby three or
four times a year. "Businessmen were too busy worrying about
how to make payroll next week to worry about what was going
on in Washington," says Mr. Pinkus. "But what was happening,
they were burying us slowly but surely and now we're in sand
up to our necks."
   A member of National Small Business United, a
50,000-member organization, he has buttonholed members of
Congress on past minimum wage and immigration bills, as well
as the pending Americans With Disabilities Act, which would
set requirements for access to businesses and employment by
the disabled. Small companies fear the bill's requirements
would open them to potential high costs and lawsuits, a fear
that backers say is unfounded.
   Despite their recent lobbying successes, small-business
people don't always get their way. Walter Young, a Wisconsin
business owner, complains in a visit to his congressman's
office about an Environmental Protection Agency demand that
he answer questions about a toxic waste dump he once used and
identify his insurance company, or risk daily fines of
$25,000. "The government has no right to ask me if I have
insurance before they find out if I'm guilty or not," he
says.
   But Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican,
offers no sympathy, saying business will pay higher taxes if
the government has to pay to clean up every toxic waste dump.
   "I don't think I got a good answer, but I'll be back,"
declares Mr. Young, the president of EGA Products Inc., which
makes industrial containers. On environmental issues, he
says, business owners "are willing to cooperate, but they
don't like to be attacked."
