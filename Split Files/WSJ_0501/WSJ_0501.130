   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega asked to withdraw from his
criminal case, complaining that the U.S. has stopped the flow
of attorneys' fees by freezing the deposed Panamanian
strongman's assets.
   The defense team filed papers in U.S. district court in
Miami yesterday, asking the court's permission to drop Mr.
Noriega as a client in the federal drug-racketeering case
because the lawyers haven't been paid in almost four months.

   "We're running out of money," said Steven Kollin, one of
four attorneys on the team. Mr. Kollin said he began meeting
with government prosecutors three weeks ago to try to resolve
the funding problem. Mr. Kollin said that Michael "Pat"
Sullivan, an assistant U.S. attorney in Miami who is in
charge of the case, said he would have to discuss the matter
"at the highest levels" in Washington. "Last Friday, he told
me `no way,'" Mr. Kollin said.
   In a statement, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Dexter
Lehtinen, said Mr. Noriega's rights haven't been violated by
the U.S. government's freezing of various bank accounts
around the world. "Mr. Noriega has been accorded all the
protections of due process and right to counsel," Mr.
Lehtinen said.
   The issue of the right to legal counsel has come to center
stage in the criminal defense community recently, in light of
increasingly aggressive efforts by the U.S. government to
seize the assets of drug traffickers and to force the
forfeiture of attorneys' fees that are paid with ill-gotten
funds. Many lawyers believe the U.S. will risk intense
international criticism if it is unyielding in its position
of freezing assets in the Noriega case.
   "If there is a basis for tying up his funds, it is correct
from a law-enforcement position," said Thomas P. Puccio, a
criminal defense lawyer with the New York firm of Milbank,
Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy. "But from a public-relations
standpoint, if you're trying the head of state of another
country, it seems in your best interest that he get the best
representation available. It plays very badly."
   Theodore Klein, a Miami defense lawyer, said he is
surprised the defense lawyers hadn't "made adequate
arrangements before getting into this morass." He said it was
unlikely the judge would allow the attorneys to withdraw from
the case, although he could make them court-appointed public
defenders. U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, who
presides over the case, scheduled a hearing tomorrow
afternoon to consider the issue.
   Mr. Kollin said that while the defense team had received
fees prior to Mr. Noriega's arrest, "since his arraignment,
we have gotten very little -- less than six figures -- to pay
expenses."
   In court papers, the defense lawyers assert that the
government concedes that not all of Mr. Noriega's wealth is
subject to forfeiture under U.S. law, noting "he received
considerable sums of money from various nations' intelligence
services." Mr. Kollin said the defense's position is that
none of Mr. Noriega's wealth is drug-related.
   He said the defense needs at least $1 million just to
cover support staff, investigative and travel costs. The team
-- currently comprised of Mr. Kollin, Frank Rubino, and Jon
May of Miami and New York attorney David Lewis -- had planned
to hire at least three more lawyers. Mr. Kollin declined to
estimate the full cost of the defense but put it at "much
less than what we understand they are going to spend on the
prosecution." The court filing cites reports that the U.S.
has already spent $12 million and may spend another $25
million on the case.

   CONSUMER GROUP CALLS state legal systems "woefully
inadequate."
   The nationwide survey was conducted by Help Abolish Legal
Tyranny, or HALT, a Washington legal-reform organization that
has been highly critical of lawyers.
   States were rated on such matters as whether they require
contracts to be written in plain language, whether consumers
can purchase legal advice from paralegals, and whether a
client can gain access to his lawyer's complaint record.
   In report cards timed to commemorate National Law Day
today, HALT gave its highest grade -- a "C" -- to California.
"It's not a bell curve," explained HALT spokeswoman Carla
Bundy. "We tried to do everything possible to jack the grades
up."
   The organization's lowest grades went to Nebraska,
Mississippi and Wyoming, all of which received an "F."
   "I reject their categorization," said U.S. District Judge
Lyle Strom, president of the Nebraska State Bar Association,
citing the state bar's "broad" legal-aid program and its
current efforts to target legal services to the elderly.
   Frank Crosthwait, president of the Mississippi State Bar,
said his state bar spends more than 43% of its dues on lawyer
discipline. He said the Mississippi bar also provides a
variety of other consumer protections, including "very active
committees in the areas of alternative dispute resolutions."
   In Wyoming, "the bar has been very concerned with becoming
more responsive to the public," said Tony Lewis, the state
bar's executive director. During the last year, he said, the
state has reduced the average time spent processing
grievances against attorneys to less than three months from
more than nine months.
   Alan Rothenberg, president of the State Bar of California,
expressed satisfaction with his state's position in the
rankings. The fact that HALT was willing to give California a
passing grade, he said, suggested that "any objective group
would have given us an A-plus."
   HALT's survey was conducted by five researchers who phoned
state bars to ask questions about consumer issues. The
organization also relied on previously published information
that was then updated.

   BROKERAGE FIRM executives encouraged deceitful sales
tactics, judge says.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy
issued a preliminary injunction against Wellshire Securities
Inc., a penny-stock firm based in New York. The injunction
bars the defendants from engaging in any similar transactions
violating securities laws. It also applies to Robert Cohen,
its president and owner; Carol Martino, its executive vice
president; and two traders. Such an injuction could only be
issued if the judge found a reasonable likelihood that
alleged wrongdoing would be repeated.
   In a civil suit filed in March, the Securities and
Exchange Commission accused Wellshire of making false and
misleading statements about stocks it was promoting out of
its "boiler room" operations. The SEC is asking that
Wellshire be forced to turn over at least $1.4 million in
allegedly illegal profits.
   Mr. Cohen and Ms. Martino argued that they shouldn't be
included in the injunction, claiming that, at most, they were
merely negligent in supervising their brokers. Judge Duffy
disagreed, however, ruling that Mr. Cohen and Ms. Martino
trained brokers to make bogus claims in touting stocks to
investors.
   Judge Duffy said that many Wellshire customers were
induced to buy stocks "based upon unfounded and often
inflated price predictions, false and misleading information
about the issues, high-pressure sales tactics, and in many
instances placement of unauthorized trades in accounts."
   Mitchell Lampert, an attorney for Wellshire and the two
executives, said his clients deny committing any
securities-law violations.

   MANDATORY PUBLIC INTEREST work by lawyers recommended by
panel.
   A committee appointed by New York State Court of Appeals
Chief Judge Sol Wachter has suggested that a rule be adopted
requiring New York's 88,000 lawyers to perform a minimum of
40 hours of non-criminal legal service for the poor every two
years. The proposed rule would have to be voted on by the
Court of Appeals.
   The recommendation was the most far-reaching issued by the
Committee to Improve the Availability of Legal Services,
which has been studying pro bono services for two years. The
committee found that voluntary pro bono service in the state
was not meeting the increasing legal needs of the poor
because no more than 15% of the state's lawyers handle civil
cases for the poor.
   Between 1979 and 1987, the number of poor people in New
York grew by 400,000, according to the committee's report.
The committee said the crisis "jeopardizes both the welfare
of poor persons and the legitimacy of the legal system
itself." Voluntary pro bono work has become a low priority
for most law firms, the committee concluded.
   Committee Chairman Victor Marrero, of the New York law
firm of Brown &amp; Wood, says it may take as long as a year
before the proposed rule is put into effect. He says that
mandatory pro bono already is the rule in some counties in
New York, Texas and Florida.
   In the past, arguments by lawyers that mandatory pro bono
violates due process or is involuntary servitude have not
prevailed in court, Mr. Marrero said.
