   NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter stock market rose late in
the day on a swell of buying set off by computer-driven
programs on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Traders say that the buy programs hit the Big Board around
2 p.m. EDT, drawing buyers into the OTC market to catch the
wave.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which treaded water for most
of the day, rose 2.09, or 0.5%, to 420.07 in the last hours
of trading. The Big Board Composite Index added 0.41%. OTC
advancers led decliners, 907 to 897. Total Nasdaq volume fell
to a slim 105.8 million shares from Friday's 116 million
shares.
   Ed Mazzella, senior vice president of OTC trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, says he was surprised that stock
prices moved as much as they did. He didn't expect much
activity until after the Treasury announces details of its
quarterly refunding tomorrow. The yield on the Treasury long
bond eased to 8.99% from the 9% level it reached last week.
The drop in the yield came as bond prices rose gradually,
helping stock prices.
   Laidlaw Transportation led the most active list with
volume of more than 2.5 million shares. The stock closed at
19 5/8, up 1/8.
   Lattice Semiconductor gained 1 7/8 to 12 1/2. The company
reported fourth-quarter net income of 26 cents a share, up
from nine cents a share a year earlier.
   Northeast Bancorp dropped 4 7/8 to 28 1/4 as its ailing
merger pact with Bank of New York takes another turn for the
worse.
   Bank of New York is threatening to end the agreement,
claiming that Northeast has breached the merger pact by
failing to maintain accurate books. Northeast said it is in
compliance with the agreement. The merger ran into trouble in
late April when the two parties disagreed over Northeast's
book value.
   Technology stocks fared mildly better. On the most active
list, Sun Microsystems gained 7/8 to 24 5/8, Apple Computer
has added 1/4 to 39 3/8, Seagate Technology was 3/8 point
ahead to 11 1/2 and Cirrus Logic gained 5/8 to 12 7/8.
   Cirrus reported its fourth-quarter net income more than
doubled to 34 cents a share from the 15 cents a share
recorded the year earlier.
   IDB Communications Group rose 1 to 9 1/4. Swissair agreed
to buy a 5% stake in the company for $13 a share.
   U.S. Healthcare jumped 1 to 13 1/4 after reporting
earnings of 25 cents a share in the first quarter, up from 11
cents a share a year earlier.
   Neworld Bancorp added 1/2 to 7 1/2. A Massachusetts
investor received regulatory clearance to increase his stake
to nearly 20% from slightly less than 9%.
   American Indemnity Financial lost 1 1/2 to 4 3/8 after
reporting a 65-cent-a-share loss in the first quarter,
compared with profit of 57 cents a share a year earlier.
   Costar gained 2 to 24 1/4 after reporting profit of 31
cents a share in the first quarter, compared with 13 cents a
share a year earlier.
