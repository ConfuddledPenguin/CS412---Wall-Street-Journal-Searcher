   NEW YORK -- Construction contracting in 1990 will slide a
bit, reflecting the continuing decline of commercial
building, according to Dodge/Sweet's Construction Outlook.
   The construction market forecasting arm of McGraw-Hill
Inc. valued construction activity this year at $263 billion,
down 1% from 1989.

   George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist of
McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group, said the
national housing performance reflected regional variations.
"Slowdown may be the proper term for what has happened to the
national economy, but for the Northeast real estate market it
is spelled recession," he said.
   Mr. Christie said that although one-family housing starts
are likely to increase 10% in central and western regions, a
decline in multifamily construction principally in the
Northeast will keep total housing starts from advancing much
beyond 1.4 million units, a 2% gain. He added that the
contracting value of nonresidential building will drop 7%
this year, continuing a slide that began in 1986. "Although a
temporary rebound is possible as the national economy
improves, the overriding weakness of commercial construction
will again become dominant before year end," Mr. Christie
said.
