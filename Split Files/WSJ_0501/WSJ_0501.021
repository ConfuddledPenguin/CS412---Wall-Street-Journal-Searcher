   JOB HOPPING: Executives think it's risky. But a challenge
can be tempting.
   Managers who might have sought greener pastures in the
past "are sitting tight" now, says Harris Corp. "There's a
degree of caution that wasn't there a year ago."
Kimberly-Clark Corp. still sees lots of applications, but
most come from executives pushed out or in imminent danger.
"The ones with the good companies are staying," it observes.
Charles Maschal, president of the National Association of
Executive Recruiters, explains switching now can be "very
risky" because the last one hired could well be the first one
fired.

   But Adolph Coors Co. says one recent ad drew "an
extraordinarily large number of responses," many from
executives who are secure. "Most people, regardless of
whether they're truly happy in their jobs, are keeping their
eyes open," it says. Chrysler Corp. says it believes few
executives today are willing to trade away safe jobs for the
promises of a new position. But it, too, says the lure
sometimes can be irresistible.
   "A lot of top executives love a challenge," even more than
job security, the auto maker says.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S TRANSFERRED? If you fit this profile, get ready to
pack.
   Salesmen 31 to 40 years old earning $30,000 to $50,000 a
year are most likely to be relocated by their companies, a
survey by Atlas Van Lines finds. And they are apt to be moved
every three to five years. Female workers can feel secure, or
more likely feel victims of an old bias. Nearly one in three
companies says it didn't transfer any female workers last
year. At another third, less than 5% of the transferees were
women.
   If you were transferred last year, you probably left New
York or Denver and headed for Washington, D.C., or
California, a separate survey by PHH Corp.'s relocation unit
shows. The company helped clients move 903 workers into the
Big Apple but assisted 1,592 in moving out, for a net outflow
of 689. Denver lost 503. The nation's capital, by contrast,
gained 459 workers while San Francisco and Los Angeles each
added more than 200 through PHH. Much of the activity
reflected cost-cutting consolidations.
                                                                                                       

   INNER-CITY KIDS find summer jobs at firms eager to provide
for tomorrow.
   "Urban students, mainly minorities, aren't always aware of
the opportunities that exist in corporations," says
Prudential Insurance Co. So it hires 28 youngsters for
entry-level jobs and helps fund training programs for others.
At York Ladder Inc., seven high-school students can look
forward to a summer of lifting and loading in 90 degree heat,
where the company hopes they'll learn "humility and humanity
that can translate into the future when they become leaders
in a corporation."
   Wickes Corp. will hire 150 neighborhood youths to work at
15 Builders Emporium Home Centers. "We feel we have a
responsibility to help prepare them for their future," it
explains. Vons Cos. teams with Pepsi-Cola and a local
foundation to award bagging jobs and motivational lectures to
more than 50 inner-city teen-agers who do well in school.
"Sometimes they tend not to be recognized as much as kids
with athletic achievements," it says.
   In Chicago, 250 firms in Hire the Future will take on
3,300 C grade-or-better students; dropouts are shunned.
                                                                                                       

   JOB HUNTERS, BEWARE] Postal inspectors say a confidence
artist is using help-wanted ads in a credit-card scam. He's
requesting resumes for a high-paying job and then calling for
Social Security and driver's license numbers that are used to
tap the applicant's credit line.
                                                                                                       

   ESOPs GREW SHARPLY in 1989, with large public companies
worried about takeovers dominating the expansion, says the
National Center for Employee Ownership.
                                                                                                       

   UNISYS CORP. signs up instructors from Temple University
to teach workers being laid off at a Philadelphia plant how
to start and operate their own businesses.
                                                                                                       

   VOLUNTEERISM LIVES, but it's getting weaker. One in five
Americans donates time to religious, civic, educational or
other groups, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. That's
down from one in four in 1974.
                                                                                                       

   BEST LAID PLANS: Strategies fail because managers don't
understand.
   That's the view of top executives who formulate the
objectives that somehow get lost down the corporate ladder. A
survey by consultant Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton finds that only
37% of the senior officials think other key managers
completely understand new business goals. Only 4% of the top
bosses think middle managers totally understand.
   Not surprisingly, compliance drops with understanding, to
the point where nearly half the top executives believe that
middle managers go along with new strategies at best
partially or not at all. The top bosses believe pay policies
at their companies may be working against the strategy
changes they try to push.
   Half say performance rewards "actually encourage
counterproductive or narrowly focused behavior."
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Three of four male pediatricians -- but less
than half their female colleagues -- believe children a year
or younger are harmed when their mothers work full time, says
the American Academy of Pediatrics and Working Mother
magazine. . . . A federal court rules an agency violates the
age discrimination act when it doesn't hire a 64-year-old
dentist for an entry-level post because he knows too much,
consultant Alexander &amp; Alexander advises.
