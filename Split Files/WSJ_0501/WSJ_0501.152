   But West Germany's second-largest banking group declined
to disclose details of the negotiations, which Mr. Most said
involved the establishment of a joint banking network of
around 50 branches.
   Frankfurt-based Dresdner has a stated strategy of
expanding broadly and swiftly into East Germany as soon as
regulations and the contemplated economic and monetary union
between the two Germanys allow.
   Mr. Most, who is chief executive officer of East Germany's
first full-service, or universal, banking institution, didn't
disclose further details of the contemplated venture, other
than to say that Kreditbank expects to sign a letter of
intent soon to set up the joint venture. Mr. Most was quoted
as saying that one-month-old Kreditbank is aiming to broaden
its business ties with West German banks.
