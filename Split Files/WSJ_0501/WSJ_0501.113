   VALENCIA, Calif. -- Huntway Partners L.P. posted a
first-quarter loss of $2.6 million, or 24 cents a unit, and
said that it may be unable to make any distributions this
year to its unitholders.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the partnership had restated
net income of $655,000, or six cents a unit. Revenue rose 15%
to $20.4 million from $17.7 million.

   Huntway, a refiner of asphalt and petroleum products, said
it would be unable to make any first-quarter distribution
"unless some form of guarantee or a capital infusion" is
obtained. Huntway also said it is in default of its current
bank-loan agreement and has obtained a waiver that expires
June 30.
   Under terms of a restructured loan agreement proposed by
the bank, Huntway's temporary $24 million facility would be
restructured into a $7 million working capital facility and a
$17 million three-year term loan. The bank also proposed that
all distributions be discontinued until the loan is reduced
to $11 million. "This would likely result in cessation of all
distributions" for 1990, Huntway said.
   Huntway said that an affiliate of its general partner may
purchase up to $5 million of newly issued Huntway preference
units. Proceeds would be used to satisfy the bank's request
for a guarantee or capital infusion, reduce the proposed $17
million loan by $2 million, pay first-quarter preference unit
distributions of $1.9 million and provide for working capital
needs.
   Huntway said that a special committee of its operating
committee has been organized to negotiate terms of a possible
sale of the preference units.
