   DALLAS -- Triton Energy Corp., an oil and gas concern with
extensive overseas holdings, said that it dropped plans to
sell its 59.47% interest in its Triton Europe PLC unit, but
that Triton Europe is continuing discussions to sell all or
part of its oil and gas assets in the British and Netherlands
part of the North Sea.
   The company previously estimated the value of its stake in
the European unit at about $180 million, based on Triton
Europe's stock price on the London Stock Exchange. Triton
Energy, which has operations in France, Britain and the North
Sea, said it ended talks about a possible sale of its stake,
because it doesn't believe it would receive an appropriate
price for the assets.
