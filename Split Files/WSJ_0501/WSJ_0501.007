   ST. LOUIS -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its
ratings on Interco Inc.'s approximately $2.2 billion in debt,
saying "debt protection measures will remain weak, even if
the company is successful in restructuring its maturing bank
debt."
   The rating concern noted that Interco, a maker of shoes
and furniture, "has yet to reach agreement with its bank
syndicate to extend the maturity of a $244.5 million bridge
loan beyond the due date of May 7." Assuming an agreement is
reached to restructure the bank debt, Moody's said it
believes Interco's four core operations "will still be unable
to support the present overall debt burden, even after
reductions achieved by currently planned asset sales."

   Moody's said that it believes "further capital
restructuring will therefore be necessary," and that "there
is a significant risk that the terms of such a capital
restructuring will not be favorable to bondholders."
   Interco borrowed heavily in late 1988 to pay special
dividends to shareholders and fend off a takeover threat.
Asset sales have gone more slowly, and garnered lower prices,
than the company's management had anticipated. In March, it
reached a tentative pact with its bank lenders, pushing back
the May 7 deadline for the bridge loan into 1992. A
definitive agreement still hasn't been announced.
   Interco said in a prepared statement that the Moody's
action "doesn't reflect any change in the operating results
of Interco's four core companies, which continue to perform
well. Since the company has not yet made an announcement on
the extension of the May 7 due date, or on the results of
studies examining alternatives to improve Interco's financial
position, Moody's action is not unexpected at this time."
   Moody's downgraded Interco's senior notes to single-B-3
from single-B-2, and industrial development bonds, senior
subordinated debentures, senior subordinated discount
debentures, junior subordinated pay-in-kind debentures, and
preferred stock to Caa from single-B-3.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Interco shares closed at 62.5 cents, up 6.25 cents.
