   In "The Wizard of Oz" Dorothy reaches a fork in the road
and asks Scarecrow which way she should go. Scarecrow points
first left, then right, and finally says, "Of course, some
people do go both ways."
   It's a lot like that on Wall Street these days: Investors
can get plenty of advice on how to allocate their money among
stocks, bonds and cash -- but the advice points every which
way.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of 10 major brokerage houses whose advice is regularly
tracked by this newspaper, only two currently recommend a
traditional allocation with 50% to 60% in stocks. Two suggest
a bigger helping of stocks; six others say to go light on
stocks for now.
   Amid rising interest rates, both stocks and bonds declined
in the first quarter. The best posture, hindsight shows, was
to be heavily in cash, as was advocated by PaineWebber Inc.
Cash means safe, short-term investments, such as Treasury
bills or money-market funds.
   Investors following the asset-allocation advice of nine of
the 10 brokerage houses would have lost a little money last
quarter, according to a study by this newspaper and Wilshire
Associates of Santa Monica, Calif. Investors following
PaineWebber's advice would have eked out a slim gain of 0.8%,
the study estimates.
   The brokers' advice has been better over the longer term.
Still, only three of the 10 companies' recommended investment
mixes beat a traditional, unchanging blend of 55% stocks, 35%
bonds, and 10% cash over the 12 months ended March 31. Over
the full term of the study, 39 months, five out of nine
companies beat that benchmark. Raymond James &amp; Associates
hasn't been giving asset-allocation advice for that long.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, led the rankings for the latest 12
months, with an estimated return of 18.4%. Prudential-Bache
has led the 12-month rankings five consecutive times, and is
also the leader for the full 39 months.
   Here's a rundown on what strategists are saying at the 10
brokerage houses. The companies are discussed in order of
their 12-month performance.
                                                                                                       

   PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Strategist Greg Smith was a raging bull
in 1987 and 1988. Last year he started getting more cautious,
and gradually reduced his recommended stock-market exposure
-- once as high as 100% -- to 35%. Now he's starting to get a
bit more optimistic, recommending a blend of 40% stocks, 40%
bonds and 20% cash. "I still don't think this will be a great
year," he says. But he thinks a lukewarm economy will allow
interest rates to decline, which "will be pretty beneficial
to the stock market." He expects stocks to show a slight loss
in the first half of 1990, but to provide a total return of
5% to 10% for the full year.
                                                                                                       

   SHEARSON: By summer, the inflation numbers that are
currently scaring investors will turn out to have been just
"a flash in the pan," says Michael Sherman, strategist for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a unit of American Express Co.
Shearson ranked second for both the 12-month and 39-month
periods. He thinks interest rates on long-term Treasury
bonds, now around 9%, will decline to 8.5% or less within six
months. That would help stocks, because "the current problem
in the stock market is totally related to the bond market."
He predicts the stock market "will hit a new high by the end
of the summer" and recommends a hefty 65% stock position.
                                                                                                       

   SMITH BARNEY: So far this year, Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co., a unit of Primerica Corp., has slightly decreased its
recommended stock position to 45% and increased its
allocation for bonds to 35%. In the stock market, "I think at
best we'll see a continuation of the trading range we have
seen," says William Helman, co-chairman of the investment
policy committee. A decline of as much as 15% wouldn't
surprise him, but "I don't think we're looking at a serious,
massive bear market." He doesn't expect big gains from bonds
either, so long as economic strength in Japan, West Germany
and the U.S. keeps "upward pressure" on rates.
                                                                                                       

   GOLDMAN SACHS: We're in for "an uninteresting market" the
next few months, says Steven Einhorn, strategist for Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. Stocks won't rise much because of fairly tight
monetary policy world-wide and high interest rates, which he
expects will come down "haltingly" to about 8.5% six months
from now. The rally that began in February in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average hasn't done much for most stocks, Mr.
Einhorn notes. But he says stock prices won't fall very far
because the economy "looks okay," inflation isn't as bad as
people fear, and companies are raising dividends. Prediction:
a range of 2500 to 2800 for the industrial average.
                                                                                                       

   DEAN WITTER: Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., rightly calls itself "the lonely bull."
Strategist John Connolly recommends investors put 85% of
their money in stocks, making him by far the most optimistic
of the 10 strategists. Last quarter, investors who followed
that advice may have regretted it: Dean Witter ranked last
for the quarter with an estimated loss of 2.7%. Longer-term,
it's done better -- third for 39 months and fifth for 12
months. Mr. Connolly says his stance will pay off as
investors realize that the economy is now safely past a
recession but isn't growing fast enough to rekindle
inflation.
                                                                                                       

   MERRILL LYNCH: "The dangers are building up" for the stock
market, says Charles Clough, strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. "Interest rates are back up, and earnings are still kind
of weak." For the next few months, he thinks stocks will be
flat to down. But he finds bonds attractive. "Our view is
that a 9% yield is a tremendous amount of value," he says. "A
9% bond doubles in eight years. I think you should lock in
here, or at least begin to." Merrill and A.G. Edwards are the
only two companies that currently suggest investors hold more
bonds than stocks.
                                                                                                       

   KIDDER PEABODY: First in the three-month rankings for the
December quarter, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a subsidiary of
General Electric Co., came in second for the March quarter.
Again, its cautious stance on stocks was vindicated. Dennis
Jarrett, a market analyst, sees "a downward bias" continued,
with the industrial average declining to 2200 or so. "I don't
see any sign that interest rates are going to reverse. I
don't see too many money managers out there ready to be big
bargain hunters," he says. His stock-market prediction:
"General low-volume deterioration." Bonds may get a brief
bounce, he says, but then interest rates are likely to creep
up to 9.25%, as the U.S. Treasury continues to borrow
heavily.
                                                                                                       

   RAYMOND JAMES: Raymond, James &amp; Associates Inc. of St.
Petersburg, Fla., is recommending a "normal" blend containing
60% stocks. J. Davenport Mosby, a managing director, says the
stock market has withstood negative news pretty well, and
that high cash holdings by institutions provide plenty of
fuel for a future rally. Unlike most rivals, Raymond James
sometimes recommends gold and real estate. Currently it urges
a 15% position in real estate, but no gold. It is bearish on
bonds. The spread between short-term and long-term rates is
unusually narrow, and Raymond James thinks it's more likely
that long-term rates will rise than that short-term rates
will fall.
                                                                                                       

   A.G. EDWARDS: Raymond Worseck, strategist at St.
Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., dodged one bullet but
was hit by another. He kept his stock allocation slim, a wise
move in retrospect. But he had a big 45% recommended position
in bonds, which were hurt by rising interest rates. He thinks
both stocks and bonds are due for a rally now, but fears a
new decline later this year. He thinks a reaccelerating
economy, high interest rates abroad and fairly tight monetary
policy by the Federal Reserve will combine to force interest
rates up, hurting both stocks and bonds.
                                                                                                       

   PAINEWEBBER: Customers who followed the PaineWebber Group
Inc. unit's cautious advice largely sidestepped the 7% stock
slide in January, since PaineWebber strategist Edward
Kerschner was recommending only a 25% position in stocks at
the time. As a table that accompanies this story shows, he is
now recommending a 56% allocation to stocks. But that doesn't
mean he is suddenly gotten a whole lot more bullish. Instead,
as explained in the accompanying story, PaineWebber has asked
to be judged on a different set of recommendations (see
related story: "How Quarterly Study Evaluates Brokers'
Allocation of Assets" -- WSJ May 1, 1990).
   For the next few months, stocks are "stuck in a trading
range of 2600 (on the industrial average), plus or minus
10%," Mr. Kerschner says. "Bond yields are nearing their
highs" at around 9%, he says, "but will take some time to
come down." For the moment, he says, the usual state of
affairs is reversed: Skill in picking individual stocks is
more important than asset allocation.
