   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino did a smashing business in
its first month of operation, but his two other Atlantic
City, N.J., casinos appear to have suffered as a consequence.
   Unaudited preliminary tallies indicate the Taj Mahal
grossed $31.6 million through April 28, which industry
executives called an impressive showing. However, the Trump
Plaza's casino revenue of about $18.3 million was down about
25% from the same period last year. The Trump's Castle
property had a decline of 11.8%, with about $17.2 million
during the period.

   Overall, the entire Atlantic City market gained 7.4% for
the month, but the gain was nearly totally attributable to
the opening of Mr. Trump's $1 billion Taj Mahal. The casinos'
revenues were provided to this newspaper by individuals
familiar with the casinos' daily revenue figures. Revenues
are reported monthly to the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission.
   In a development that Mr. Trump said is related to the
Plaza's poor showing, Trump Plaza President Jack O'Donnell
resigned late Friday, saying, "I got tired of working for
Donald Trump." Mr. O'Donnell declined to comment on the
reasons for his decision.
   However, a person close to Mr. O'Donnell said the
executive was concerned that Mr. Trump's marketing of the Taj
Mahal would hamper Mr. O'Donnell's efforts to operate the
Trump Plaza. This person said Mr. O'Donnell felt uneasy
handing over the casino's data base of special clients to Taj
officials both because he felt it was poor business practice
and because the action might violate covenants in the Trump
Plaza's publicly traded bonds.
   Mr. Trump confirmed the sharing of data but denied such a
practice was unusual or a violation of covenants, and said
other casino companies with more than one property did the
same thing.
   "Outside of the Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza is the best
facility in Atlantic City, and I wasn't satisfied with its
performance," said Mr. Trump. "It was No. 1 in `win' {for
1989} with $306 million, but it made less money than it made
the previous year when it was No. 2 in `win.' " A casino's
"win" is the amount of money lost by gamblers.
   For all of 1989, Trump Plaza had a net operating profit of
$24 million, while Trump's Castle had a loss of $6 million,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
   From January through March, before the Taj opened,
revenues for Trump Plaza and the Castle generally were stable
from the same period a year before.
   Mr. Trump said he was pleased with the results of the
first month of the Taj's operations. The casino's April 2
opening was met with great fanfare, coupled with speculation
over whether the Taj could earn enough to break even -- $1
million to $1.3 million a day.
   Because the casino's slot machines were fully operational
only part of the month, people in the industry said it is
difficult to project future performance from that month's
figures. However, Taj competitors said they were impressed
with the early results.
   "They're better numbers than I thought they would be,"
said Peter G. Boynton, president of Caesars, a competing
boardwalk casino, which posted a 7.4% decline in revenue in
April. The Caesars World Inc. casino's drop-off, he said, was
totally attributable to the Taj's opening. He cautioned that
when Showboat opened in 1987, "it had a great month, and then
went into the toilet for the summer."
   Mr. Boynton said he didn't expect that the Taj would
suffer the same fate.
   Mr. Trump said that while his two other casinos were hurt
by the opening of the Taj, their numbers weren't as bad as
they appear. He said both facilities suffered an unusually
low "hold" percentage, which measures the percentage of the
total amount wagered that the casino ultimately retains.
"What happened was the other two properties played unlucky,"
he said.
   The Taj's opening also appears to have soured the luck of
many Atlantic City casinos not owned by Mr. Trump. According
to the preliminary April report, Tropworld, owned by Aztar
Corp., had an 8.8% drop in revenue from the same period last
year, while Bally's Grand revenue dropped 19.3%. Both of
those casinos are located at the opposite end of the
boardwalk from the Taj and were expected by many analysts to
suffer the most from its opening.
   The Claridge casino's revenue dropped 2.3%, while Bally's
Park Place fell behind 0.9%. However, the Sands, owned by
Pratt Hotel Corp., gained 12.3%. And Harrah's casino, which
is located in Atlantic City's marina area and competes most
directly with Trump's Castle, gained 2.1%. Harrah's is owned
by Promus Cos. while both of the Bally's casinos are units of
Bally Manufacturing Corp.
   The two casinos located closest to the Taj, the Showboat
and Resorts International, were widely expected to benefit
most from the new casino's debut. But neither appear to have
gained as much as expected: The Showboat Inc. casino's
revenue was up 0.6%, while the Resorts International Inc.
casino declined 6.6%.
   The results could be disappointing to Resorts officials
and bondholders who hoped the Taj's opening would lift that
property from its doldrums. Resorts is currently under
federal bankruptcy court protection in Camden, N.J., and is
undergoing a restructuring of its $925 million in publicly
traded debt. A Resorts spokesman said: "We are roughly on
target according to the plan that was submitted to
bondholders and the bankruptcy court. The plan always called
for 1990 revenue to be less than 1989's."
   The performance of Mr. Trump's casinos last month has
taken on added interest in light of his remarks last week
that he intends to sell, refinance or securitize many of his
holdings, including his Atlantic City properties. Included in
his plans is a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle.
