   A late blue-chip rally driven by computer-assisted program
trading lifted stock prices out of the doldrums.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.71 to 2656.76
in very light volume. Bond prices posted moderate gains in
sluggish trading with the yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue slipping below the psychologically important 9%
level. The dollar ended mixed.

   The pace of trading was lethargic across financial
markets, partly because of holidays in Japan and in parts of
Europe. Japanese investors have been major players in the
U.S. bond market and their absence tends to keep other
players on the sidelines. And with the bond market nearly
moribund, stock investors are reluctant to make major moves
as well.
   In any case, analysts said the level of uncertainty about
the direction of the economy, interest rates and inflation is
keeping a lid on market activity. Last Friday's report on
first-quarter gross national product, which showed the
economy growing at an annual rate of 2.1% but inflation
leaping upward at a 6.5% annual rate, merely exacerbated the
confusion. While the stock market would ordinarily welcome
the seemingly modest rate of economic growth as a boon to
flagging corporate earnings, the inflation data hint that
higher interest rates may be just around the corner. Higher
rates increase the cost of doing business, taking a toll on
earnings, as well as cool the economy.
   In the bond market, traders are debating not if but how
soon the Federal Reserve will push short-term interest rates
higher in an effort to curb inflation. Many economists
contend that the first quarter's inflation was merely the
lingering effect of the December 1989 freeze that drove food
and fuel prices up sharply. But others believe that inflation
is becoming embedded in the economy, such as in stepped-up
wage increases. They are hoping for strong measures to bring
price increases to heel and they point out that the sooner
the Fed acts to drive up short-term interest rates, the more
confidence investors will have in the long-term economic
outlook.
   Indeed, if the Fed were intending to raise interest rates,
next week's big quarterly Treasury refunding auction would
provide the perfect opportunity. With an estimated $30
billion or more in Treasury debt likely to be sold, analysts
reason that the Fed isn't apt to wait until after the auction
to push rates up because such action would undermine
investors' purchases.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 122.8 million shares. Declining issues
were ahead of gainers 749 to 732.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose modestly. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or about
$2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue
slipped to 8.989%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6796 marks and 158.90 yen compared
with 1.6775 marks and 159.30 yen Friday.
