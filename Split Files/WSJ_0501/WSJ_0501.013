   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Curtice Burns Foods Inc. reported a 25%
decline in net income for the fiscal nine months and said it
expects lower earnings for the year ending June 30 because of
plant and administrative consolidations and unfavorable crop
conditions.
   For the nine months, the food processor posted net of $8.3
million, or 98 cents a share, down from $11 million, or $1.32
a share, a year earlier. Year-earlier per-share earnings were
adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid Dec. 20, 1989.

   Sales rose 13% to $702.1 million from $620 million.
   The company said short crop situations severely hurt
results at three of its major operations, including Comstock
Michigan Fruit, Southern Frozen Foods and the newly acquired
Southland Frozen Foods.
   For fiscal 1989, the company earned $14.9 million, or an
adjusted $1.78 a share, on sales of $807.2 million.
