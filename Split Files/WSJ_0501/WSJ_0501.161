   Tootal Group PLC, a British clothing, textile and thread
maker, said pretax profit for the year ended Jan. 31 fell 16%
to #35.7 million ($58.4 million) from #42.3 million a year
earlier, the first such decline in nine years.
   Profit after taxes and minority interests, or profit
attributable to shareholders, dropped 18% to #24.4 million
from #29.7 million. Per-share earnings slumped 22% to 8.53
pence from 11 pence.

   Sales rose 7.8% to #529.8 million from #491.5 million.
   Tootal is to recommend a final dividend of 3.05 pence a
share, raising the total payout for the year 2.1% to 4.95
pence from 4.85 pence.
   Despite the earnings decline, Tootal said its streamlining
strategy, begun in 1986, showed a "major advance" in the past
year, shifting the balance of earnings away from a heavy
dependence on Africa and the commodity end of British
textiles into more growth markets, especially Asia.
