   LOS ANGELES -- U.S. District Judge Manuel Real sentenced a
former concert promoter to 15 years in prison for his role in
a leasing scheme that defrauded 14 banks, thrifts and other
financial institutions of $23 million.
   Kimball Dean Richards of Whittier, Calif., will be placed
on five years' probation after completing the sentence and
will be barred from engaging in any entertainment-related
businesses during that time. The issue of restitution hasn't
been made final, said Assistant U.S. attorney Richard E.
Robinson. A lawyer for Mr. Richards wasn't immediately
available to comment.

   On March 8, a federal jury convicted Mr. Richards, 34
years old, for his role in a scheme to defraud the
institutions by the sale of leases on non-existent audio
recording and concert sound and lighting equipment. Last
year, two other men involved in the scheme were sentenced to
prison and each ordered to make restitution to the victims of
$21.9 million.
   The defrauded institutions include Union Bank; a unit of
Bank of Tokyo; a unit of Great Western Financial Corp.; and
units of General Electric Credit Co. and First Interstate
Bancorp.
