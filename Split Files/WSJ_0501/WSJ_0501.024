   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- First National Corp. said it changed
from a calendar year to a fiscal year ending Feb. 28 as a
result of the acquisition of Clyde A. Short Co. on that date.
   The fiscal year more closely reflects First National's
business cycle since the acquisition, the company said. Clyde
A. Short, now First National's major business, supplies
employee-motivation and incentive-award programs to industry.

three cents a share, on revenue of $208,973, First National

the company said.
