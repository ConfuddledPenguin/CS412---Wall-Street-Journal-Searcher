   Boca Raton, Fla. -- "Bee-yoo-tiful," declared Rosalie
MacDonald, president of the Ziegfeld Girls of Florida, as 11
women ranging in age from 53 to 79, some astonishingly
well-preserved, triumphantly tapped out the last measure of
their dance.
   The community center where "the Girls" were rehearsing
rang with applause, but choreographer Cathy Dooley kept her
enthusiasm in check. The annual charity luncheon and
extravaganza, emceed by Tony Marvin "of Arthur Godfrey fame,"
was only five days away, and the shuffle ball changes needed
attention.

   "One more time," she ordered firmly, rewinding the
cassette player to the opening bars of "Hooked on Broadway."
Originally, Ms. Dooley confided, there were 12 performers in
the number, but one got married, moved away and refused to
give up her snazzy costume -- black tails, top hat and silver
cane -- even when the Ziegfeld Girls offered a handsome
ransom. "We couldn't find another costume so from now on we
can only have 11 in this routine."
   "Touch, kick. One two three. MOVE," instructed Ms. Dooley,
a former showgirl at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, now owner
of the Rock-ette Dance Academy in Margate, Fla. ("I have the
hyphen in the name so I don't have any legal problems," she
explained.)
   This time around, bee-yoo-tiful the number wasn't. "I
guess we should have left it alone," sighed Ms. Dooley.
"Iris," she told a 79-year-old in a salmon-pink shirt and
white shorts, who in palmier days danced in Paramount stage
shows, "Don't get upset if the audience applauds. Don't say
`Shhh, we have to hear the music.'
   "Do it better this time so we can get on to the other
dance. The other dance needs a lot of work."
   Work does not faze the Ziegfeld Girls (they are always
called girls though many are grandmothers and
great-grandmothers). Since Mrs. MacDonald founded the
organization 10 years ago to help needy women of the theater,
its 130 members have given six or seven benefit performances
a year, rehearsing all summer to keep legs, once the toast of
Broadway and environs, in dazzling shape.
   The $300,000 the group has raised so far has gone,
primarily, to outfit Ziegfeld Manor, a motel turned
retirement home. Right now, it can only accommodate six, "but
we figure with donations we can build a bigger place," added
Mrs. MacDonald, a former chorine in Earl Carroll's
"Vanities."
   A onetime member of the Ziegfeld Club of New York -- there
also is a club for former Latin Quarter dancers and showgirls
-- Mrs. MacDonald broke off with the group because "every
penny we made had to go to New York. Profits on our monthly
luncheons, our dues, the profits on our shows. They got full
credit for everything."
   According to the organization's bylaws, 75% of the
membership must have a theatrical background. Currently, the
roster includes Jo Newswanger, 78 -- she's the one wearing a
white sweatband during rehearsal -- who danced in nine
Broadway shows with the likes of Ruby Keeler, Alice Faye and
Al Jolson; Mary Anne Sterling (that's her stage name), 64, a
former Latin Quarter dancer; and Connie Anderson, a 60ish
ex-Rockette.
   But the dancers must share the glory -- and the senior
citizen stage-door Johnnies -- with the showgirls who wear
elaborate headdresses and parade around the stage doing the
"Ziegfeld Walk" -- toe-heel, toe-heel -- to the accompaniment
of "A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody."
   "I love doing it," said Almita La Sala, 68, who during her
days as a Ziegfeld showgirl at New York's Amsterdam Theater
answered to Almita Ortega. "It keeps your past together with
your present," added Ms. La Sala, a.k.a. Miss Hubba Hubba of
1945 at Hollywood's Wilshire Theater.
   Of course they all are youngsters compared with Muriel
Merrill, 93, who understudied comedienne Marilyn Miller in
the 1918 Ziegfeld Follies. "I was a good little tap dancer at
the time," said Mrs. Merrill, whose not-so-secret ambition is
to dance with George Burns, and whose soft-shoe routine
always brings down the house.
   That's no mean tribute here in Boca, which isn't exactly
Broadway, but it's a town without pity for would-be dancers
with two left feet. "When girls come in, naturally, we want
to see what they can do," said Mrs. MacDonald, who's in her
70s. "One girl came in and said, `I'm a very good dancer.'
She was coming in after the beat every time so I said, `Do
you know you're coming in after the beat?' I found out she
was a good ballroom dancer IF a man was holding her. Well,
that wasn't enough. So we let her help out backstage."
   Tanna Callahan, 52, a former model and weathergirl, was
having a little trouble with the beat herself. She kept
moving toward the back when everyone else was moving forward
during the opening steps of the trouble-ridden "If They Could
See Me Now." Worse, she kept losing track of the number of
front kicks in the routine.
   "Where are our heads when we're kicking?" auburn-haired
Mrs. Callahan wanted to know.
   "On your shoulders," Ms. Dooley replied.
   "They're going to hate me. I can't get my hat right.
They're going to hate me," mourned Mrs. Callahan, who as a
child walked around her parents' horse farm balancing a glass
of water on her head to attain the carriage of a Ziegfeld
showgirl.
   "We've got to do it again because Tanna messed up the
opening," insisted Ms. Dooley.
   "Oh, you're going to hate me," said Mrs. Callahan.
   "Yes, yes, we hate you," the chorus girls chorused.
   Cathy Dooley has learned some things in her four years of
choreographing for the Ziegfeld Girls. She has learned, for
instance, not to tell her charges the dance must be simple.
"If you tell them it has to be simple they get insulted. Some
of them think they're real hoofers," she said.
   Further, she has learned the value of building lots of
kicks into the choreography. "The more kicks the girls do,"
she said. "the more the crowd loves it."
   There's no arguing that some can kick and tap out a time
step better than others. "If you let it get to you you could
get very frustrated," said Dawn Bolton, 61, a former Latin
Quarter dancer. "I like all the girls. I understand they're
not all old pros. I just try to do what I can do and accept
what they can do."
   The rehearsal floor was a blur of black stocking-clad legs
as the Girls, minds sharply focused, top hats arcing in
tandem, wound through the intricate formations one more time.
"Flap, flap, step, cross, lunge. Bang the rhythm out," called
Ms. Dooley.
   "The admiration I have for them because of their age and
exuberance and vitality is unending," she told a younger
woman who felt old by comparison with these "girls."
   "They're a hot ticket," said Bernice Melniker, projects
chairman of the Miami Children's Hospital Auxiliary, who
signed the Ziegfeld Girls to perform last year at the
organization's annual Golden Harvest Luncheon. "The audience
was so enthusiastic because they have a nostalgic appeal.
They were an inspiration."
   Sometimes, to give her elderly neighbors a lift, Ms.
Dooley brings them to a Ziegfeld show. "I'll rub it in a
little," she admitted, "I'll say, `See what the girls can do.
See what they can do.'"
