   ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. appointed
Harold A. Wagner executive vice president in charge of
world-wide gases and equipment, the company's largest
business, with about $1.5 billion in annual sales. Mr.
Wagner, 54 years old, president of European operations for
the industrial gases and chemicals concern since July 1988,
assumes the new position June 1.
   Analysts say the promotion suggests that Mr. Wagner is
being groomed to succeed Dexter F. Baker, chairman and chief
executive officer, following the recent abrupt departure of
Frank J. Ryan, president and chief operating officer. Mr.
Ryan, 58, who had been considered Mr. Baker's likely
successor, was forced out in a management clash with Mr.
Baker, who assumed Mr. Ryan's positions. Mr. Baker is 62 and
must retire at 65, but the company said discussion of a
successor is "premature."

H. Agger, vice president and general counsel, was appointed

president of business divisions in the chemicals group, was

president and general manager of process systems, was
