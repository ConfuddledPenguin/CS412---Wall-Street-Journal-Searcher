   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court let stand a ruling that
allows 32 former employees of General Motors Corp. who were
laid off to sue the company for alleged fraud for refusing to
consider rehiring them.
   Without comment, the justices left intact an August 1989
ruling by a federal appeals court in New Orleans that the
former employees may sue for damages under state law and
aren't restricted to filing complaints with the National
Labor Relations Board.

   The 32 workers were employed at GM's Packard Electric
Division plant in Clinton, Miss. In 1983, the company
announced layoffs and agreed with the union to give workers
the choice of receiving severance payments or retaining their
seniority and rehiring rights.
   Under the agreement, the 32 workers chose severance
payments. When GM began hiring again in 1985, the workers
applied for jobs. They said they were told that not only had
they given up their seniority rights but that they weren't
eligible to be considered for jobs, even with a pool of
general applicants.
   When they sued GM, the company argued that the issues
should be handled by the NLRB and decided under federal labor
law. The appeals court rejected GM's arguments, ordering a
trial, and the Supreme Court yesterday refused to hear GM's
appeal.
   GM said it is "truly disappointed" at the court's action.
John Maciarz, a GM spokesman, said, "We plan to continue to
pursue the case vigorously." (General Motors Corp. vs. Wells)
                                                                                                       

   Court in Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other action yesterday, the Supreme Court:
   -- Ruled, 9-0, that the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which operates airports, trains and other facilities
for the two states, may be sued for damages in federal court
by a worker who was injured on the job. (Port Authority
Trans-Hudson Corp. vs. Feeney)
   -- Let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in
Washington that allows random drug testing of Transportation
Department employees who have safety-related jobs. The policy
was challenged by aviation and railroad safety inspectors,
highway safety specialists, aircraft mechanics and other
government workers represented by the American Federation of
Government Employees.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said the court's
action was a victory for a "safe and drug-free transportation
system." (AFGE vs. Skinner)
   -- Let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in New
York that abortion rights groups lack standing to challenge
the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church. The
lawsuit was filed in 1980, arguing that the anti-abortion
activities of the Catholic Church were highly political in
nature and should lead the Internal Revenue Service to take
away the church's tax-exempt status. (Abortion Rights
Mobilization Inc. vs. U.S. Catholic Conference)
