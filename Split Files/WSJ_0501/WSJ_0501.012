   LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.) -- Alexander V.
d'Arbeloff, 62 years old, resigned as a director of this
personal computer software maker to devote more time to
Teradyne Corp., where he is chairman and chief executive
officer. His departure, leaving Lotus with five directors,
makes way for combining the boards of Lotus and Novell Inc.,
a Provo, Utah, network software maker, in a merger announced
last month. Carol R. Goldberg, 59, president of Avcar Group
Ltd., was re-elected a Lotus director but will resign after
the merger is completed this summer. The two actions will
result in a combined board of seven members, four from Lotus
and three from Novell.
