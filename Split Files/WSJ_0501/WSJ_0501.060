   In the next academic year Yale University will charge each
student $20,820, an increase of 7.8% from this year. The
reason, say officials: "Major increases in the cost of many
of the services and supplies that are essential to the
educational programs of the university."
   If you're planning a vacation flight in late spring,
you'll find that restricted coach fares are 10% higher than
they were a year ago. And so it goes with many items --
haircuts, health care, shoe repair, apparel, to cite a few
examples.

   Some prices are declining, to be sure. But the Federal
Reserve's goal of steadily squeezing out inflation is
receding further into the future and its anti-inflation
campaign seems likely to lose rather than gain momentum. At
best, many economists say, inflation in 1990 will match last
year's pace. Moreover, there's rising concern that price
increases will actually intensify.
   Why the increased concern about inflation? For one thing,
the Federal Reserve, despite its goal to squeeze down price
increases, is under growing political pressure to avoid moves
that might derail the expansion, especially in an election
year. Inflation, moreover, is growing as a worldwide problem,
pushing up prices of U.S. imports. "The global trend is
toward accelerating inflation," says Paul W. Boltz, an
economist at T. Rowe Price Associates. Then, too, cost-push
inflation -- when rising costs are the chief reason for
rising prices -- is becoming more of a problem, and that's
hard for the Fed to deal with. Finally, a lot of the upward
pressure is in services, where prices seem to keep rising no
matter what the central bank does.
   The consumer price index in the first quarter rose at an
annual rate of 8.5%, the highest rate in eight years. The
jump stemmed in large part from weather-related increases in
food and energy prices, and in March there was a significant
rise in apparel prices. Many economists predict the inflation
rate will plunge this month and next month, but a growing
number of analysts figure the price pressures after that will
be onward and upward.
   So far economists don't expect any immediate price
explosions. The 51 forecasters interviewed monthly by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators this month forecast a 4.6% rise in
the consumer price index this year, up from a prediction of a
4.4% gain a month earlier.
   Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco and a member of the Open Market Committee, the
Fed's chief policy-making group, predicts the inflation rate
will slow from the first-quarter pace but will still be
higher than last year's 4.8%. "That," he says, "is
uncomfortable and unacceptable."
   Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve
Bank and also an Open Market Committee member, dissented when
the committee voted in February to maintain unchanged policy.
His argument: "The Federal Reserve should tighten policy
immediately to combat inflation."
   David H. Resler, chief economist of Nomura Securities
International, is one of a number of analysts who expect the
Fed to tighten policy soon, probably by a small increase in
the federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loans
of bank reserves. Mr. Resler fears such action could tip the
economy into a recession.
   The Federal Reserve might be encouraged to take such a
modest move, reaffirming its anti-inflation role, because
economic growth has been stronger than expected. The Blue
Chip analysts on the average now expect the
inflation-adjusted gross national product to rise by 1.9% in
this year's first half, compared with a forecast of a 1.7%
gain a month earlier. But the Blue Chip group probably will
raise its forecast this month, since the first quarter's 2.1%
GNP gain, announced last week, was considerably stronger than
the analysts expected.
   Donald Straszheim of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith
says, "Economic growth will be considerably stronger in the
first half of 1990 than the consensus expectation." He looks
for growth of about 2.5% in this year's first six months.
   Supporting such forecasts of stronger growth is a sharp
rise in durable-goods orders in March. On a seasonally
adjusted basis, orders rose by 6.7%, the biggest monthly gain
since December 1988, when orders climbed by 7.4%, which
prompted the Fed to tighten monetary policy. The Fed eased
again in June 1989, in what Chairman Alan Greenspan called a
midcourse correction.
   Looking ahead, Lacy Hunt, chief economist of Carroll,
McEntee &amp; McGinley, a New York investment firm, doubts there
will be any significant anti-inflation moves by the Fed.
"Greenspan," he says, "has grown cautious and more responsive
to White House pressure to hold down interest rates." But he
does expect a modest tightening to be voted by the May
meeting of the Open Market Committee.
   The rapid growth of the money supply since last June
worries the Fed's Mr. Hoskins. Since mid-1989, M2, which
consists of currency, checking deposits and many savings
accounts and is the most commonly watched aggregate, has
grown at an annual rate of more than 7%, well above the
growth rate for the prior year.
   But at this stage of the business cycle, Mr. Hoskins adds,
cost-push inflation is beginning to play a larger role. In
the 12 months ended March 31, for instance, the Labor
Department's employment cost index rose 5.5%, compared with a
5% gain in the 12 months. Recently, moreover, the rise has
accelerated. The index climbed 1.7% in this year's first
quarter, compared with a 1.2% increase a year earlier.
   A so-called leading inflation index compiled by Columbia's
Center for International Business Cycle Research had dropped
to a four-year low in February, but it bounced up in March.
It is heavily weighted with cost factors and its rise,
according to Geoffrey Moore, the center's director, "raises
the possibility that inflation may accelerate in coming
months."
   Major contributors to the March rise, he reports, were an
increase in the percentage of companies experiencing slower
deliveries and a rise to 63.4% in the percentage of the
population employed, which matched the highest monthly rate
on record.
   Record employment, however, isn't being matched by
productivity, and this adds to cost pressures since
productivity gains tend to offset the inflationary impact of
pay increases. With the supply of available labor dropping,
output per hour by nonfarm workers last year rose by only
0.9%, the smallest gain since 1982.
   Cost-push and demand-pull inflation, as economists call
the two basic kinds of inflationary pressure, have posed
challenges for the Fed throughout its history. Usually
cost-push inflation is strongest when the economy has been
expanding for a long time, as now. It also tends by its
nature to be more difficult to control through monetary
policy. Demand-pull inflation -- too much money chasing goods
and services -- usually predominates earlier in expansion and
responds more readily to the Fed's brakes.
   In late 1980, the consumer-price index was rising at an
annual rate of nearly 16%, so the Fed set out to bring it
down by tightening its policy. The move succeeded quickly: By
1982 inflation was down to 4%. A cost of the sharp drop,
however, was the deep recession of 1981-82, a fact that
Federal Reserve officials haven't forgotten.
   Since 1982, the Fed has moved cautiously, and the
inflation rate has stayed in the area of 4% to 5%, except for
a temporary respite in 1986, when an oil price drop actually
produced declines in the consumer index, and the first
quarter of 1990. The Fed, from all appearances, hasn't the
slightest intention to repeat the Draconian measures of 1980
-- very tight money -- to erase 4%-to-5% inflation.
   According to Paul L. Kasriel, vice president of Chicago's
Northern Trust Co., "The Fed's strategy is to keep real
economic growth moderate over an extended period of time in
order to lessen pressures on resource utilization rates and,
thus, bring down the rate of inflation."
   Federal officials talk of pushing the inflation rate down
to zero, a task that they concede might take at least five
years. But this may be unrealistic. Joel Popkin, a former
commissioner of Labor Statistics now serving as an economic
consultant in Washington, says the Fed is overestimating "its
ability to point the inflation rate down to 4%, let alone
zero."
   The reason, many analysts believe, is that in times of
economic weakness, many people expect the Fed, under
political pressure to avoid a recession, to ease money.
Expectations of an easier policy lead people to spend more,
tending to increase inflationary pressures.
   As Allan Sproul, former president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, used to say, the Fed is independent within
the government, not independent of it.
   Even Mr. Hoskins believes that there may come a time when
the Fed will drop its anti-inflation rhetoric and turn, once
again, to fighting recession.
   One fact that bodes ill for the zero-inflation advocates
such as Mr. Hoskins is that so many influential analysts
don't seem too worried by 4%-to-5% inflation. Their views
help to persuade the public that it's pointless to risk a
recession by tightening money to eliminate the remaining
inflation.
   James Tobin, a Yale University economist and Nobel
laureate, argues that the question is whether the inflation
is anticipated or not. If inflation is anticipated, he says,
companies, individuals and governments can arrange to deal
with it.
   But this may be a questionable assumption. The government
has partly indexed the tax system to help to protect
taxpayers from inflation, many pensions are indexed and, if
you listen to securities salesmen, common stocks are supposed
to be a hedge against inflation. But the protection is uneven
at best, even if individuals know what the future holds.
   The trouble is that no one can know exactly what the
inflation rate will be. Mr. Hoskins says, "I don't think
people really believe that the Fed can keep the inflation
rate at 4% indefinitely, so a permanent 4% rate is not
anticipated. I believe the rate will go above 4%, and the
markets seem to agree. The flareup over the 8.5% CPI rate in
the first quarter certainly didn't show any faith in a
permanent 4% inflation rate."
