   Should some future historian ever want to mark a precise
date at which neo-conservatism passed from the political
scene, this past weekend would do as well as any. This was
the weekend of the convention of the Committee for the Free
World, an annual event that brings together in Washington a
large number of the grand names of anti-communism:
Jean-Francois Revel, Norman Podhoretz and Jeane Kirkpatrick.
It might have been expected that the first meeting of this
group in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the
communist regimes of Eastern Europe would have been a giddy
celebration. But no.
   Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Defense Department official
and now director of the Center for Security Studies, reported
at the final session, on Sunday morning, "Never since 1945
has the Soviet Union been so close to military pre-eminence
in Europe as it is today." Grim news, but what really seemed
to be depressing the conferees was not a frightened
confidence that Mr. Gaffney is right, but the disturbing
suspicion that he is wrong. And if he's wrong, what next?

   Irving Kristol expressed an unpopular minority view:
"Communism is over. Collectivism isn't over, but communism is
over. And that means that anti-communism is over too." The
few under-30 guests applauded, but the great majority of the
conferees, over 50 for the most part, shook their heads. They
reserved their approbation for the remarks expressed at the
Saturday sessions: NATO was still alive and still vital to
the future of Europe; without support from the U.S., a
unified Germany would be vulnerable to Soviet bullying;
American culture was in decline. The closest anyone came to a
bold vision of the future was Mel Lasky, editor of Encounter:
"We must be imaginative, innovative. We must do again what we
did in 1945."
   It is no disparagement of what was done in 1945 to find
repeating the past not an especially imaginative plan. Of
course, what was accomplished between 1945 and 1955 was
stupendous. It was in those years that the institutions that
formed the modern West -- the West that Eastern Europe is now
begging to join -- were created. If the Committee for the
Free World does not represent the generation that devised
those institutions, which is dead, it does at least represent
that generation that argued for them when they were young and
fragile. As such, that generation deserves immense credit; as
such, it is understandably reluctant to concede that new
institutions might be necessary.
   Or new habits of thought. Mr. Kristol's warning that
collectivism did not die when communism did was strikingly
vindicated by the conference itself. Carl Gershman, the
executive director of the National Endowment for Democracy,
delivered an impassioned plea for U.S. government assistance
to democratic forces in Eastern Europe.
   Not everybody present agreed with Mr. Gershman, or with
Mr. Lasky's even more ambitious demand for massive
government-to-government assistance to Eastern Europe. But
everybody who expressed an opinion on U.S. help for the East
did seem to assume that the only assistance worth discussing
is the sort of the assistance that governments can offer.
   The Czech finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, has said
repeatedly that Czechoslovakia needs investment, not aid. The
best help that the West can give will come not from the NED
or the Peace Corps or AID, but from General Electric, Suzuki,
News International, Oxford University, Medecins sans
Frontieres, Deutschebank, the SmithRichardson Foundation and
CNN. The best help Western governments can offer is an open
international trading system.
   The sharpest sign of generational clash at the conference
was not the statism of the older generation, but its tone. In
a question-and-answer session, one of the younger guests
accused the panel of excessive pessimism: "You'd never know
that six communist regimes had been toppled within the past
six months." That, replied one of the dour speakers, is why
we are so worried.
   Other speakers went beyond pessimism to downright
bitterness. American culture is in decline, lamented Hilton
Kramer, editor of the New Criterion. John O'Sullivan, editor
of National Review, corrected him: Decadence is a state of
low vitality, and American culture was undeniably vital.
Might it not be more accurate to describe American culture as
poisonous rather than decadent? Gertrude Himmelfarb, a
historian, gloomily complained, "The state of the
universities has never been worse."
   And things are just as bad overseas. "The president of
Lithuania is a music teacher, and the president of
Czechoslovakia is a playwright," Mr. Kramer scoffed. Worse,
Vaclav Havel is reported to have a poster of John Lennon on
the wall of his Prague apartment.
   All in all, a disappointing weekend. The definitive
failure of a generation's work means that it is time for a
new generation to take over. But so too, it turns out, does
the definitive success.
