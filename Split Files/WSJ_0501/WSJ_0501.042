   OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product fell 0.1% in
February as a result of declines in the output of both goods
and services, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   Gross domestic product is the total value of a country's
output of goods and services.

   The February decline followed a 0.3% decrease in January
and a 0.2% gain in December. In February, production of both
goods and service industries fell 0.1%. The service-industry
drop was the first monthly decline since March 1989.
