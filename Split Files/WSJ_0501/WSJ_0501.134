   Whitehall Corp., a Dallas-based defense concern, said its
management's slate of directors was re-elected, defeating a
slate nominated by Cambridge Capital Fund Limited
Partnership, a New York investment fund.
   Neither side could give the actual voting results, but
Cambridge said one of its candidates received as much as 46%
of the votes cast. Whitehall wouldn't comment on that claim.

   Cambridge also said that while it questions the proxy
tabulations, it acknowledged that it didn't receive the votes
needed to unseat Whitehall's board. It also said it is
withdrawing its offer to acquire the 90.4% of Whitehall that
it doesn't already own for $20 a share, or about $62 million.
Still, a Cambridge spokesman said the group is "contemplating
our alternatives." In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Whitehall shares closed at $14.375, down
62.5 cents.
