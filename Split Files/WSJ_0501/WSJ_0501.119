   SEATTLE -- Boeing Co., while reporting that first-quarter
net income slid 34% from a year-earlier period swollen by an
accounting-related gain, posted an 87% surge in operating
profit on a 60% rise in sales.
   The world's leading jetliner maker also boosted its
dividend and split its stock 3-for-2.

   Those steps, mirroring moves taken a year ago, were
announced yesterday at the aerospace company's annual meeting
here. Boeing increased the dividend 25% to 37.5 cents a share
from 30 cents. Both the quarterly payout and the split, after
which the dividend will be adjusted to 25 cents a share, are
payable June 8 to stock of record May 18. Boeing has raised
its dividend annually since 1984.
   Net income for the latest quarter was $302 million, or
$1.31 a share. That compares with $459 million, or $1.99 a
share, when Boeing recorded a one-time gain of $298 million,
or $1.29 a share, from the adoption of a new accounting
standard. On an operating basis, the company earned $161
million, or 70 cents a share, a year ago.
   Sales shot up in the quarter to $6.44 billion from $4
billion. For the full year, Boeing said it would register
about $27 billion in sales, up from $20.28 billion in 1989.
   Yesterday's dividend actions were widely anticipated on
Wall Street, where Boeing is the only airframe maker whose
fortunes are viewed favorably these days, because of its
strong commercial airliner business. "We just can't build
airplanes fast enough," Dean Thornton, president of Boeing's
commercial aircraft unit, told shareholders. He noted that
the demand for new planes is so great, carriers are beginning
to place orders for equipment that they won't even receive
until the year 2000.
   By contrast, most aerospace concerns are stuck exclusively
in a faltering military market. And McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
the only other U.S. company with a commercial jetliner
operation, is having problems on the factory floor, causing
it to lose money on every plane it ships.
   Boeing, though, has had few such troubles. Last year, it
did experience some manufacturing hiccups with the 747-400
jumbo jet and endured a 48-day strike by the machinists
union, but it has recovered nicely and is currently
assembling an average of 31 jets a month. The company is in
the process of increasing that to 34 a month. And yesterday,
Mr. Thornton unveiled plans to possibly increase the rate to
38 monthly by mid-1991 and 41 by 1992.
   Wolfgang Demisch, who follows Boeing for New York-based
UBS Securities, said he thought such a plan was realistic,
adding that because the company's commercial lines are well
developed at this stage, a heightened production schedule
isn't likely to trigger any problems. "Once you're up and
running, there isn't any reason why you shouldn't be able to
increase the numbers," he said.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, said a more robust
schedule was needed to help offset the company's declining
defense business, which, despite streamlining, is still
expected to lose money this year. Last year, Boeing's
military transport subsidiary suffered a $559 million loss,
while the missiles and space segment earned $85 million.
"We're readdressing the balance between commercial and
defense," Mr. Shrontz said.
   Considering the bottom line, there was a lot of downbeat
talk yesterday by Boeing executives, who predicted the
Pentagon budget will decline 5% annually in real terms until
1995. Mr. Thornton also issued warnings that the company's
work force desperately needs to improve its level of
productivity and not become insouciant in the commercial
arena. Moreover, Mr. Shrontz said, Boeing's first-quarter
earnings represented about 4.7% of sales, a figure "below the
margins needed to fund the investment required for projected
growth and new product development in the years ahead."
   Nonetheless, it was difficult to hide all the good news.
For one thing, Boeing's commercial backlog stands at 1,701
airplanes valued at nearly $90 billion. The company's overall
cash and short-term investment position also bounced back
from the effects of the union walkout in the first quarter,
rising to $2.9 billion from $1.9 billion at the end of 1989.
   Besides cranking up the commercial aircraft lines, Mr.
Shrontz said, Boeing's commitment to build the 767-X is also
a response to the slip in defense work. The new wide-body
twin-jet, the chairman said, will most likely be launched by
the summer, and is set to take to the skies five years
afterward.
   The meeting yesterday was largely routine, though there
were some particularly passionate words from shareholders
about Boeing's choice to continue to do business with
racially divided South Africa. The company maintains that it
has an obligation to deliver reliable jets to those who order
them, and then help maintain the planes to ensure the safety
of all air travelers. At one point, a shareholder asked that
George Shultz, the former secretary of state and a Boeing
director, give his views on the matter. He declined, however,
to speak.
