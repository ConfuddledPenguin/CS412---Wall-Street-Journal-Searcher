   BOSTON -- Eastern Utilities Associates said it extended
its tender offers for Fitchburg Gas &amp; Electric Light Co. and
Unitil Corp. from yesterday until midnight Sept. 7, 1990, in
order to give the Securities and Exchange Commission
additional time to review the proposed acquisitions.
   EUA has offered $36 a share for the common stock of
Fitchburg and $40 a share for the common stock of Unitil.

   Fitchburg and Unitil, which have agreed to merge with each
other, have repeatedly stated their opposition to the EUA
offers.
   In announcing the extension of the two offers, EUA's chief
executive officer, Donald G. Pardus, stated: "EUA remains
totally committed to its goal of acquiring Fitchburg and
Unitil because it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, customers and employees.
   "We reiterate our willingness to sit down with their
managements to negotiate a transaction that assures their
stockholders will receive premium value for their common
stock while avoiding the further unnecessary expense of a
contested transaction." He said Eastern would also consider a
stock transaction if shareholders preferred that.
