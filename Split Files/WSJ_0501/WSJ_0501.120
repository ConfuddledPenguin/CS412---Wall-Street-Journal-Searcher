   SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and
Samsung Semiconductor Inc. said they settled two-year-old
litigation over Advanced patents covering semiconductor
circuits.
   In its suit, filed in August 1988 in federal court in San
Jose, Calif., Advanced said that Samsung infringed on patents
covering its AM22V10 programmable array logic chip, one of
Advanced Micro's leading products.

   As part of the settlement, Samsung Semiconductor, the San
Jose, Calif., unit of South Korea-based Samsung, acknowledged
that the Advanced patents are legally valid and said that in
two years it would stop selling certain products, including
chips protected by the patents.
   Advanced said it would receive royalties from the
resulting sales, which cover existing Samsung commitments to
customers, although an Advanced spokesman declined to
elaborate on the monetary amount.
   The Advanced Micro complaint was a countersuit to an
earlier lawsuit filed by Samsung against Advanced Micro, in
which Samsung was seeking to have the basic patent covering
Advanced's chip invalidated. Advanced Micro sued three other
concerns on the same patent-infringement claims.
   Those claims remain outstanding against Atmel Corp. and
Cypress Semiconductor Inc., both of San Jose; and Gazelle
Microcircuits Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.
   With the settlement of the litigation, the two companies
said they agreed to discuss possible future business
relationships in areas of mutual technological interest.
   Advanced Micro stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at
$8.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
