   LONDON -- New car sales in Europe in March rose 0.9% from
a year earlier, possibly signaling a slowdown after a healthy
start to the year.
   The market is "definitely not maintaining the momentum"
displayed in February and January, when car sales were up
2.1% and 4% on the year, respectively, said Stephen Reitman,
an industry analyst at UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd.

   Statistics from 12 nations that usually account for 94% of
Western Europe's passenger car sales showed new car
registrations totaled 1,270,000 in March, up 22% from
1,040,000 in February and up from 1,260,000 a year earlier.
   In March, sales were off on the year in five of the
countries included in the survey: Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the U.K. Among the gainers, West Germany
posted a 2% rise, while France rose 6.8% and Italy rose 3.4%.
