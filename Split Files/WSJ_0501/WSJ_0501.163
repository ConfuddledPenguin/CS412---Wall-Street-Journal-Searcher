   LONDON -- The Office of Fair Trading said a London Stock
Exchange rule change that allows for a delay in reporting
large trades is anti-competitive.
   Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of fair trading, said
the 24-hour delay in reporting certain details of large deals
deprives the market of information relevant to the price of
shares and gives trading opportunities to those market makers
involved in the deals that are denied to their competitors.

   The decision to postpone reporting trades of more than
#100,000 ($163,550) until 24 hours after completion of the
transactions came in early 1989, as market makers complained
that instantaneous publication of large share deals on the
Stock Exchange Automated Quotation, or SEAQ, system spoiled
its liquidity and led to spurious volatility in share prices.
The stock exchange earlier this year proposed shortening the
publication delay for big trades to only 90 minutes. But Sir
Gordan indicated even that delay might be too long.
   Sir Gordon said he hadn't uncovered any evidence that
on-line publication of large trades led to less liquidity or
that there was a major problem of off-exchange dealing. He
also said the 24-hour delay hasn't achieved the exchange's
aim of cutting down on volatility.
   Sir Gordon said another rule change, which removed the
obligation of market makers to deal with each other, doesn't
hurt competition.
   The director general's report was forwarded to Britain's
secretary of state for trade and industry, Nicholas Ridley,
for comment. Mr. Ridley has the authority to request that the
exchange change its procedures, but a spokesman declined to
comment on Mr. Ridley's position. The exchange said that the
Office of Fair Trading report wasn't expected, and that it is
still reviewing its proposed rule changes.
