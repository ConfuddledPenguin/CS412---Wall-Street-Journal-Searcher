   Your March 28 article concerning the New York City art and
antiques center known as Place des Antiquaires ("Art Mall
Tries to Be More Than a Still Life") makes the gratuitous
statement that Place des Antiquaires is one of New York
City's "most glaring retailing mistakes," yet never supports
this claim with objective criteria. Some of the shops are
bringing in an impressive $2,000 per rentable square foot in
sales.
   You also omitted the fact that 16 of our 45 dealers have
expanded beyond their original premises and rented more
space.

   You apparently talked to a handful of dealers who are not
doing as well as others or who have complaints about a
variety of noneconomic factors. Obviously, such situations
exist, but that is perfectly normal for a group of 45
competing merchants, and no cause for the alarming
conclusions drawn.

   ---
   As a retailer within the premises of Place des
Antiquaires, I was among the first of the pioneers who shared
a vision of success that this innovative and elegant
atmosphere would afford the "smaller" antique dealer. In our
gallery the art-buying public has overwhelmingly given Place
des Antiquaires "thumbs-up" with its checkbooks and charge
cards. Indeed, we expanded our premises this past January.
   Obviously, we find the "traffic" more than adequate, and
are considering a further expansion in the future here.
   You would have the reader believe that half of Place des
Antiquaires is vacant and unrented. This is simply not true.
The resident dealers are renting 90% of the available gallery
space, and that doesn't leave much room for many new faces,
which must first pass muster with management.
