   British Steel PLC could soon be about to realize its
ambition of acquiring one of Spain's most profitable steel
companies, Jose Maria Aristrain S.A.
   Industry sources said Aristrain's board is expected to
decide later this week in favor of selling the
Olaberria-based company to British Steel.

   A British Steel spokesman in London refused to comment,
but the company is understood to have offered around $410
million for the family-owned company, which has annual
revenue of about 50 billion pesetas ($471.5 million).
   The planned purchase, if it materializes, is part of
British Steel's strategy for expansion in continental Europe,
where it has servicing and stocking centers but no
manufacturing subsidiaries.
   Aristrain is Spain's largest producer of steel sections
and has an extensive marketing network in Spain. Its
acquisition would provide British Steel with a valuable base
in Southern Europe.
