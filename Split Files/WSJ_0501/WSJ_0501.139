   HOUSTON -- Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. said it is
putting itself up for sale, a step that industry experts say
could yield its owners about $2 billion if all its pieces are
sold.
   The company, just a step below the nation's major oil
companies in size, owns considerable natural gas and crude
oil reserves in Indonesia, the British North Sea and the Gulf
of Mexico. It also has an interest in large petrochemical
operations in Louisiana.

   Union Texas is 40%-owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
and 40%-owned by Allied-Signal Inc.
   The company said directors have authorized executives "to
explore a sale of the company and other alternatives." The
sellers haven't picked an investment banker to handle the
sale.
   Union Texas said that a transaction isn't guaranteed,
recalling the difficulty the company had in its initial
public offering in September 1987, when the two controlling
shareholders pulled out of the sale at the last minute. The
result was a drastically reduced offering in both price and
size. The company said any sale probably wouldn't be
completed before November.
   Still, the current outlook for oil companies is more
bullish than a few years ago, and Union Texas's assets are
viewed favorably. "This is a quality company," said Ronald J.
Barone, an oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   Wall Street experts yesterday valued the company at $1.85
billion to $2.06 billion, though many energy properties sold
in the past two years have exceeded their appraised values.
The estimates work out to a range of $22 to $24.50 a share.
Union Texas shares rose $2.625 yesterday to $20.50 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Allied appears to be somewhat more optimistic, setting a
target of about $1 billion for the sale of its 40% stake in
Union Texas. "That's in the ballpark of what we think we
might be able to get," a company spokesman said in Morris
Township, N.J.
   Edward L. Hennessy Jr., chairman of Allied and a Union
Texas director, told shareholders at the annual meeting
yesterday that the aerospace and automotive products company
would use proceeds to reduce debt and buy back stock.
   KKR owns 33.3 million shares plus warrants. A sale at $25
a share would give KKR $832 million on its stock and $145
million for its warrants, or a total of $978 million -- or
nearly four times KKR's original investment of $250 million
in 1985. That's a total return of a little more than 30%
annually.
   While that sort of return doesn't match the 50% annual
rates that some leveraged buy-out funds once boasted of, it's
a piece of good news in comparison with some of the woes that
have afflicted KKR and other buy-out firms since the collapse
of the junk-bond market.
   KKR had been criticized for the deal a few years back
after oil prices plunged from $28 to $8 a barrel. Now that
oil prices have rebounded, the investment looks a lot better
-- particularly in comparison with some of KKR's leveraged
buy-outs which have soured, such as Seaman Furniture Co. and
Hillsborough Holdings Inc.
   In New York, KKR declined to comment on the planned sale.
   While Allied has wanted to sell its stake for some time,
it isn't clear what triggered yesterday's announcement. Some
on Wall Street believe that Allied was prepared to sell even
if KKR wasn't, and that may have prompted KKR to go along to
avoid either a partner it wouldn't like or a minority
position.
   Commenting on the timing, a Union Texas spokeswoman said,
"There continues to be a lot of interest in oil and gas
properties. The Huffco sale is an example of that," she said,
referring to the sale of Huffington Corp. to Taiwan's
national oil company last month.
   Huffington's primary asset was a 20% interest in an
Indonesian joint venture in which Union Texas has a stake
almost double that size. The venture supplies natural gas to
one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas facilities.
A sale price wasn't disclosed but oil industry speculation
puts it roughly at $500 million to $700 million.
   Mr. Barone of Kidder Peabody values Union Texas's
Indonesian interest at $1.1 billion. It accounts for 1.24
trillion feet of the company's 2.01 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas reserves. U.S. operations, at 581 billion cubic
feet at year-end 1989, represent the second-biggest portion
of the company's gas reserves. Along with 30 million barrels
of oil reserves, combined U.S. reserves are valued by Mr.
Barone at about $688 million.
   Union Texas's total world-wide crude reserves are 140
million barrels, the biggest part of which -- 79 million
barrels -- lie in the British North Sea.
   The company also holds a 42% interest in a Geismar, La.,
chemical plant that produces ethylene, valued by one industry
expert at about $300 million.
   Union Texas reported first-quarter earnings of $31
million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $311 million, and
has maintained an aggressive capital spending program,
raising its budget 41% this year to $361 million.
   Allied acquired Union Texas in 1962, though the company's
growth accelerated only in the late 1960s. Union Texas began
as a sulfur company in Sulphur, La., in 1896 and entered the
oil business in 1926.
