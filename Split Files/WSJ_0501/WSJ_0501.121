   WASHINGTON -- The Kingdom of Denmark filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer $100 million
principal amount of S&amp;P 500 Index Protected Equity Notes.
   The notes are designed to permit an investor to
participate in the appreciation in the U.S. equity market
between the issue date and the maturity date of the notes.
The appreciation is measured by the increase, if any, during
this period in the S&amp;P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. If
there is no increase in the index during this period,
investors will be paid the amount of their initial investment
at the maturity of the notes.

   Denmark said it is selling the notes as a means to
decrease the cost of its debt.
   Underwriters for the offering will be led by PaineWebber
Inc.
