   I read James P. Sterba's April 6 Leisure &amp; Arts article,
"Down With Shuttlecocks," with intense amusement. Obviously,
nobody likes to have his recreational fun spoiled by a change
in his gym's schedule. And to have only "three adults and
four children" take over the gym for two hours to play
badminton, replacing the "dozens of basketball-loving men and
boys from New York's mean streets," must have been very
frustrating.
   Basketball is a great game, but Mr. Sterba jumped to
several conclusions in his article that warrant comment.

   First, unless he plays with basketball players very
different from those I have played with through the years, he
makes a rather generous "leap of faith" to term them
"God-fearing males gathered into the warm Christian bonds of
basketball fellowship." The hoopsters' contempt and
disrespect for other sports are notorious, as is obviously
the case with Mr. Sterba.
   His desire to "smear badminton fair and square" by linking
the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and badminton (by way of
Poona) is a non sequitur. Real shuttlecocks are made from
real geese (and often ducks). But, Mr. Sterba would have lost
his bet, because they are not pulled from "unsedated" geese.
Rather, the feathers are leftovers from the down industry,
i.e. sleeping bags and down jackets, etc.
   Requiring nearly two weeks elapsed time of manufacturing,
huge baskets of feathers are sorted, trimmed, bleached,
dried, re-sorted, inserted, glued, sewn and precisely tested
for weight, flight distance and vibration and graded
accordingly. Thousands of families, primarily in China and
Taiwan, make their livelihood as shuttlecock makers. I
personally have seen the process.
   Admittedly, badminton in the U.S. has a long way to go.
Only a very few badminton players can afford to train full
time. But progress is being made. U.S. National Badminton
teams have shown marked improvement in world rankings
recently, the promotional nightmare of badminton's backward
stigma is slowly dissolving, and more facilities are
providing some badminton court time.

   With the exception of soccer, badminton is played by more
people in the world than any other sport. One of the main
reasons China, Indonesia and other badminton powers are
powers is because almost all of their children start playing
at a very early age and are properly coached. This gives
those countries an enormous pool to draw from. We all realize
that is exactly what is needed in the U.S. Naturally, the
more individuals available for competitions, the better
showing that can be made.
   I believe it's important that Mr. Sterba and the 44% of
the sportscasters who wanted badminton removed from the
Olympics become familiar with the game. If he and they do,
they all will be supportive -- I'll guarantee it.
