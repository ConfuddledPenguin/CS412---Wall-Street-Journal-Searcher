   MANILA, the Philippines -- Investments in the Philippines
will slow down to a growth rate of 11.5% this year due to
political and economic factors, Economic Planning Secretary
Cayetano Paderanga Jr. said.
   The possibilities for growth have narrowed because of
December's coup attempt, the ongoing drought and an
electricity crisis, according to the economic planning
department.
