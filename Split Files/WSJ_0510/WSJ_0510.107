   DETROIT -- A federal judge declared a mistrial in the
final, damage-award phase of a patent suit brought by Robert
W. Kearns against Ford Motor Co. after seven jurors couldn't
convince a lone holdout that the inventor should get no more
than $3 million.
   For Mr. Kearns, who had earlier won a judgment from the
same jury that Ford infringed his valid patents for an
electronically-controlled, intermittent windshield wiper
system, the mistrial means another delay in a 12-year battle
that involves not just Ford, but nearly every other major
auto maker in the world.

   But interviews with four of the eight jurors suggest that
Ford, which switched its lead counsel after losing the first
phase of the trial, came close to emerging with just a
scratch from a case some patent law experts -- including
presiding U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn -- said had
the potential for a huge jury award. Ford had stipulated that
it installed wiper systems that infringed on the Kearns
patents on more than 20.5 million vehicles between 1971 and
1988.
   The jury foreperson, Sharon Harrison-Hamburg, said last
night that after six days of debate, she and six other jurors
felt Mr. Kearns should receive between $2.5 million and $3
million -- not much more than the $1.5 million maximum Ford
lawyers argued was reasonable. She called Mr. Kearns's
lawyer's plea for an award of $325 million an "insult (to)
our intelligence."
   All eight jurors agreed on Tuesday that Ford's
infringement of Mr. Kearns's patents wasn't willful. A
finding of intentional infringement would have allowed the
judge to double or triple any damage award.
   But on the question of money, "there was one who would not
negotiate and held out for $20 million," Mrs.
Harrison-Hamburg said. Three other jurors reached yesterday
described the deadlock similarly. One said that the majority
at one point considered awarding Mr. Kearns as much as $7
million. The woman identified as the dissenter by two of the
jurors couldn't be reached for comment.
   "It was a horrible feeling to leave there" without
reaching a verdict, said juror Anne Grasser.
   Now another jury could have to wrestle with the damages
issue in a new trial, unless the two parties settle. The two
sides didn't know yesterday evening what had gone on in the
jury room, because Judge Cohn didn't allow them to question
the jurors in court.
   Mr. Kearns declared yesterday that he would fight on. "It
was a disappointment, of course," Mr. Kearns said of Judge
Cohn's ruling. "If the journey has to be longer, we're ready
to make that journey," he said.
   Ford, in a statement yesterday, said it, too, was
disappointed that the jury couldn't reach a decision on
damages. "However, we are pleased that the jury recognized
that Ford didn't intentionally infringe the Kearns patents,"
the company said.
   Ford added that it has asked Judge Cohn to overrule the
jury's earlier verdict upholding the validity of the Kearns
windshield wiper patents. That's the first step in what is
likely to be a lengthy appeals process.
   "We continue to believe the Kearns patents were invalid
because the ideas covered by them were disclosed by patents
previously issued to other inventors," Ford said.
   Ford has admitted that three of its intermittent
windshield wiper systems are similar to Mr. Kearns's designs,
but has argued that doesn't matter because Mr. Kearns's
patents are invalid.
   The impasse in the jury room provoked a lengthy battle,
during which the majority of the jurors sought to convince
the single dissenter that Mr. Kearns's inventions simply
weren't worth tens of millions of dollars.
   "We were trying to get reasonable numbers," said juror
Stanley Shackman, who, like Mr. Kearns, is an electrical
engineer.
   Judge Cohn declared the mistrial shortly after 4 p.m. EDT
yesterday after jurors sent a note describing the deadlock as
hopeless. He ordered the parties to stay in the courtroom for
several minutes while the jurors left the federal courthouse
in downtown Detroit.
   The Kearns-Ford litigation is being watched with intense
interest by the world's major auto makers, nearly all of whom
are defendants in a series of patent infringement suits filed
by Mr. Kearns since 1978. The Ford case is the first to come
to trial.
   After Ford lost the first phase of the trial in January,
it brought in a new team of lawyers headed by Malcolm Wheeler
of the Los Angeles office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom.
   During the second phase of the trial, Mr. Wheeler rained
blows on Mr. Kearns's argument that he was the victim of
willful wrongdoing by Ford. Among other things, Mr. Wheeler
presented letters sent by Mr. Kearns to his lawyers and a
business partner during the early 1970s in which the inventor
appears to urge that his patent claims be expanded to cover
specific details of Ford's existing wiper systems.
   Mr. Kearns's lead trial lawyer, Paul Janicke of
Houston-based Arnold, White &amp; Durkee, argued to the jurors
that they should focus instead on Ford's admission that its
wiper systems mirrored the claims of Mr. Kearns's patents.
Ford, he said, had reaped $557 million in profits from the
infringing systems. Ford's argument that Mr. Kearns was owed
just $1.5 million "isn't reasonable, it isn't fair, and it
isn't just," he told the jury.
   Mr. Janicke offered jurors two different methods for
calculating a "reasonable royalty." One yielded about $190
million, while the other produced a royalty of $325 million.
   "That fell by the wayside quickly," said Mrs. Grasser.
"There was no basis to it."
