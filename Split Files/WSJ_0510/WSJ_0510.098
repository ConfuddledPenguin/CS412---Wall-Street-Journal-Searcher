   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and top congressional leaders
agreed to begin budget talks at the White House Tuesday, but
the administration insisted that Mr. Bush hasn't surrendered
his opposition to tax increases yet.
   A senior administration official who is involved in the
budget talks emphasized in an interview that while the
administration is approaching the talks with an open mind,
"we haven't changed what we favor and we haven't changed what
we're opposed to."

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater gave reporters the
same message. "In the past, some people have said that
raising taxes has to be on the table," he said. "But no
preconditions means just the opposite. It means the table is
clean."
   Nevertheless, talk on Capitol Hill continued to center on
taxes. Referring to Mr. Bush's "Read my lips: No new taxes"
campaign pledge, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said that "we won't have to worry
about lips anymore" but instead can "start digging into our
pockets."
   Republican congressional leaders joined the White House in
trying to cool speculation that the budget summit will
provide political cover for tax increases. Emerging from a
caucus with his members, House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R., Ill.) told reporters, "I told them to keep their
powder dry."
   Other Republicans, however, continued to argue that
Democrats are forcing the president to raise taxes. Rep. Bill
Archer of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways and
Means Committee and a delegate to the summit, said, "When we
sit down and talk, we expect them {Democrats} to put higher
taxes as the linchpin of a deficit-reduction program."
   That sort of talk led House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.), who is to head the summit talks when Mr.
Bush isn't present, to complain: "If people simply see it as
a political high-ground exercise, then it won't go anywhere."
   Added House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.): "Good faith
means not posturing politically on either side."
   But in an illustration of the tensions between the
parties, remarks by Rep. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.)
suggesting that Mr. Bush had been "intellectually dishonest"
during his 1988 presidential campaign provoked a
parliamentary flap on the House floor. Republicans, objecting
to that description of Mr. Bush's position on taxes, tried to
block Mr. Torricelli from proceeding. It took a House vote,
won by Democrats, for the New Jersey liberal to win
permission to continue. Mr. Torricelli subsequently described
Mr. Bush's position on taxes in terms only slightly less
stringent, saying that Mr. Bush had been "intellectually
inconsistent."
   Meanwhile, the White House -- reacting in part to demands
from many Democrats that the administration help prepare the
public for the possibility of a painful deficit-reduction
package -- described the government's fiscal plight in
increasingly dire terms.
   "Severe action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and
keep the economy on a sound track," Mr. Fitzwater said. "The
deficit is increasing due to a number of factors -- partly
rising interest rates, reduced revenues to the government,
and the cost of the savings and loan bailout."
   But responding to concerns voiced by rank-and-file
Democrats, House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
asked White House Budget Director Richard Darman to testify
before his committee Tuesday both to explain the
administration's swelling deficit forecast and to detail tax
and spending policies that the administration proposes in
response. A spokeswoman for Mr. Darman said that because
summit talks are to begin Tuesday, he won't testify on that
day.
   Congressional negotiators at the so-called summit next
week will include the Democratic chairmen and the senior
Republicans on the Senate and House Budget, Appropriations
and tax-writing committees. Two partisan House leaders also
will be involved: Speaker Foley designated Mr. Gephardt as
his representative and Mr. Michel designated House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.). Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) picked Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.) as
his representative. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R.,
Kan.) designated Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas).
   The White House lists the president, Chief of Staff John
Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and Mr. Darman as
its formal negotiating team, but officials said Messrs.
Darman and Brady will play the major day-to-day role. Other
members of the administration will also be included. White
House chief economist Michael Boskin will deal with tax and
economic policy; Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft will address
defense issues; and the president's domestic policy adviser,
Roger Porter, will handle domestic spending programs.
   Although administration officials said talks will go on as
long as both sides find them productive, a senior official
said the hope is that they will progress quickly and be
concluded in "weeks rather than months."
   The immediate goal of budget talks is to find a way to
reduce the deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, by
between $45 billion and $55 billion. That's the amount the
administration says is needed to avoid across-the-board
spending cuts this fall under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. If all spending on the thrift industry
cleanup is included in the complex Gramm-Rudman calculations,
the administration says, $100 billion in deficit-reduction
measures will be needed.
