   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African new-vehicle
sales dropped 20% to 23,096 units in April from 28,951 units
a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers (Naamsa) said yesterday.
   April's sales were 24% lower than the 30,576 units sold in
March, the association said.

   Naamsa's director, Nico Vermeulen, said the decline in
sales in April were larger than expected. He attributed it to
a combination of unfavorable factors including uncertainty
over political changes in the country, work stoppages at
various assembly plants during the month and the impact of
stringent monetary measures.
