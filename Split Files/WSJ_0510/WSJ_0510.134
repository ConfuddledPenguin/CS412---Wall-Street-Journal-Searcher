   NEW YORK -- DDB Needham Worldwide Inc. announced a new
compensation plan in which it promises to "guarantee" its
clients' results -- but industry executives expressed
skepticism.
   DDB Needham, a unit of Omnicom Group, heralded its new
plan, which it calls "Total Creativity. Guaranteed Results,"
as a groundbreaking step in agency compensation. Clients will
be given a rebate of as much as 30% off a negotiated base
rate if they agree to a long list of conditions and if
specific, agreed-upon results aren't reached. If goals are
met, the client would pay DDB Needham a bonus.

   But ad-agency executives, while lauding DDB Needham's
attempts to be more accountable to its clients, said they had
no plans to follow suit. They noted that agencies have been
negotiating compensation plans with clients for years. The
once-standard 15% commission has given way to negotiated
incentive and bonus systems.
   "I'm very skeptical," said Marvin Sloves, chairman of ad
agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves. "Is this a thoughtful,
intelligent way of being recompensed, or a publicity
gimmick?"
   DDB Needham insists that its plan is different from other
incentive plans. For one thing, DDB Needham is the first
agency to announce a compensation package as policy. For
another, the plan relies on DDB Needham and the client
identifying specific goals, such as specific sales increases.
   Industry executives also wondered how DDB Needham can
guarantee results, when so many factors besides advertising
come into play in a product's sales. "Anytime you get paid
through an incentive, it's a great idea," said Mr. Sloves.
"But I just don't understand how to implement" such a system
intelligently.
   DDB Needham's clients will be trying to sort that out now.
Keith Reinhard, the agency's chairman, said that two, which
he declined to identify, are interested in trying it. And
Peter Falcone, president of DDB Needham's New York office,
said H.J. Heinz Co.'s Weight Watchers is interested. But Mr.
Reinhard refused to speculate on how many of DDB Needham's 55
U.S. and Canadian clients, all of whom are being offered the
plan, would ultimately take the agency up on its idea. DDB
Needham insiders quietly speculated that the figure would be
relatively low as clients take a wait-and-see attitude.
   Clients may be put off, moreover, by the onerous
conditions DDB Needham demands. Among other things, DDB
Needham insists that it be given total, unquestioned control
over a client's entire marketing program -- including work by
outside public-relations, direct-mail and other unrelated
marketing firms. "Insane," scoffed Arthur A. Anderson, an
advertising consultant at Morgan, Anderson &amp; Co., New York.
"This may be a classic marketing ploy for the ad agency to
reassert control over these other budgets."
