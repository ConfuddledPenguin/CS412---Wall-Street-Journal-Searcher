   HONOLULU -- A federal jury convicted Center Art Galleries
and two of its officers on mail and wire fraud charges in
connection with the sale of fake lithographs by surrealist
artist Salvador Dali.
   The U.S. District Court in Hawaii ruled that the gallery
and its officers sold prints that they had reproduced at a
cost of $50 to customers for prices ranging from $1,000 to
more than $20,000. The major selling tool of the gallery,
according to the U.S. attorney's office in Honolulu, was to
tell customers that the prints were a great investment
opportunity.

   In some cases, according to the attorney's office, even
the original works from which the reproductions were made
hadn't been executed by Dali.
   The two convicted officers of the gallery are William D.
Mett, its president, and Marvin L. Wiseman, its vice
president.
