   PRO BONO MATURES prompting changes in law practices.
   Once an informal system of providing free legal aid for
the poor, pro bono work is being built into the structure of
legal practice. At large law firms "there has been a trend to
do more and to be more visible," says Kimball Anderson of
Winston &amp; Strawn, Chicago. Holland &amp; Knight, Tampa, set up a
formal program in January. One reason: "It helps the
recruitment effort," says Steve Hanlon. Other benefits:
contacts in the business community, greater visibility and
inexpensive training for lawyers.

   Corporate law departments are using pro bono to tackle
issues that fit company strategy, says Craig Smith of the
Corporate Philanthropy Report, citing insurance company pro
bono programs that help the elderly. With 648 bar sponsored
pro bono programs now in operation, the number of lawyers
involved increased 8% last year, says Dennis Kaufman of
American Bar Association.
   Meanwhile, studies on unmet legal needs fuel the push for
mandatory pro bono in some states, says the ABA's Esther
Lardent.
                                                                                                       

   MORE MOMS get pampered as service gifts for Mother's Day
increase.
   Flowers and perfume, move over. The latest in Mother's Day
presents are gift certificates for services ranging from a
massage to a day of housecleaning. Mother's Day demand for a
$198 five-hour beauty package is growing "by a grandiose
amount," says Vicki Lanzarotta, manager of the Gates, a San
Marino, Calif., salon. Why? "More women feel stressed these
days," says a spokeswoman from Elizabeth Arden Salon, New
York, where big sellers include a $45 body massage and a $225
five-hour beauty package.
   Huff n' Puff Maid Service, Atlanta, says Mother's Day gift
sales have picked up this year, thanks to the growing number
of working mothers who don't have the time or energy to
clean. Meet My Maids in West Los Angeles says children in
their 30s and 40s with aging moms are the biggest
gift-certificate buyers on Mother's Day. Despite a $500
minimum, some people even order a catered Mother's Day meal
to be served at home, says Grayce Baldwin of Just Leave
Everything to Us Ltd., Hollywood Hills, Calif.
                                                                                                       

   COMPOST PROJECTS proliferate in backyards and
municipalities.
   Seattle is providing 9,000 residents with free composters
and an hour consultation as part of an expanded backyard
composting program. More municipalities compost leaves, and
some are turning to composting to solve bigger waste disposal
problems. Portland, Ore., is building a $20 million facility
that will compost 185,000 tons of garbage a year, with the
end product sold to nurseries and vineyards.
   At Gardener's Supply Co., Burlington, Vt., the composting
trend is translating into sales: Compost supplies are now the
company's biggest product group. "We are selling composters
faster than we can get them in," says spokesman Paul Conrad.
Others are jumping into the business. Howard Stenn of Tilth,
a Seattle organic gardening group, says dozens of people "are
just starting to manufacture compost bins."
   The risk for large projects: diminishing demand for the
end-product as compost projects multiply, says law firm
Nixon, Hargrave, Devans &amp; Doyle.
                                                                                                       

   BAG AGAIN: Massachusetts Volunteer Network revives "bottle
bags," that can be filled with returnables and left on the
street for the homeless. In its first week, DeLuca's Market
in Back Bay had two bagfulls redeemed -- not by homeless but
by regular customers. "We're still working out the tweaks,"
MVN says hopefully.
                                                                                                       

   BABY THE MOM, is the message going out on Mother's Day
bouquets sent by 70 Hartford, Conn., florists this year. The
program is part of an effort to reduce the Hartford infant
mortality rate, which is nearly twice the national average.
                                                                                                       

   THE NAME GAME: Most companies taking new names for
themselves or their products don't test before adopting them,
says a survey by Rivkin &amp; Associates, Midland Park, N.J. The
most common source of new names: an internal task force.
                                                                                                       

   KIDS MEALS become a hot market for food companies.
   Children ages six through 12 ate fewer frozen dinners in
1986 than any other segment, says the Lempert Report,
Montclair, N.J. "Not many youngsters were jumping at the
chance to chow down on breaded filet of sole with a side of
broccoli." Now major food companies are filling the gap with
frozen and shelf-stable products. First to market: My Own
Meals, which began with mail-order in 1987 and now sells
through supermarkets and Toys "R" Us stores.
   This spring's entrants: ConAgra's Kid Cuisine and Tyson's
Looney Tunes Meals for Kids, both frozen lines with items
such as chicken nuggets. Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co. tests a
shelf-stable Kid's Kitchen line. Taking a cue from fast-food
chains, Kid Cuisine includes a fun pack so "the kid can play
with the fun pack while the adult prepares the food," says
ConAgra's Susan Hanley.
   Parents' growing comfort in letting children use the
microwave is feeding demand for such products, says Bill
Bernardo of Hormel.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Celsus Designs Inc., Hacienda Heights, Calif.,
markets stuffed-animal arms, heads and feet that attach to
computer screens to create Computer Critters. . . . A new
doll designed to bolster children's confidence is dubbed
F.R.O.Y.D., standing for For Reality of Your Dreams.
