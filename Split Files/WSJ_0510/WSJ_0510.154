   New York -- Leonore Tawney used to be a weaver, a
pioneering, innovating weaver. In the '50s and '60s, she
showed the world that weaving didn't have to be rectangular;
its sides could taper and swell; it could have holes in it
and still be beautiful.
   Ms. Tawney's so-called woven forms and open-warp
tapestries inspired generations of weavers and brought about
a new concept of weaving, not as something to wear, place a
plate on or hang on the wall, but something that had no
practical function at all.

   But Ms. Tawney made her last weaving piece in 1976. Since
then she has been hanging threads from the ceiling and
calling them cloud sculptures. She has been building collages
like nests inside the drawers of old wooden chests: birds'
eggs, seashells, a knotted rope, feathers. She wrapped a
wooden duck in pink gauze. She covered an antique wooden shoe
form in pages from old books and stuck an animal jawbone on
top.
   Why is Ms. Tawney doing these things? Ask her, and you'll
hear that she lost her Manhattan loft in 1976 and went to
India for six months and didn't have the space for a loom.
And then the government asked her to do a piece for the Santa
Rosa Federal Building, so she went to California, where "I
stayed for a month to get inspiration. And it came," she
says.
   It was Cloud Series IV (1978), 2,550 blue linen threads
each 16 feet long, suspended from a piece of blue canvas on
the ceiling.
   More than 100 pieces are on view here in the biggest and
most complete show of this spry 83-year-old's career, at the
American Craft Museum through June 17. The show moves to the
Art Institute of Chicago from July 26 through Oct. 28, and to
the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., from April 12, 1991,
through July 21, 1991.
   The exhibition marks the first time Ms. Tawney's weavings
have been shown with her non-woven work. Curator Kathleen
Nugent Mangan has mixed up all the pieces, so a viewer is
forced to make connections between, say, her first weaving,
the colorful, mildly abstract "St. Francis and the Birds,"
and her most recent assemblage, "Half Heard, in the
Stillness." It's an egg carton painted black, filled with
black eggs, and topped with a dried rose.
   Born in Lorain, Ohio, in 1907, Ms. Tawney was 40 before
she studied art seriously. After working as a proofreader in
Chicago and marrying a psychologist, George Tawney, who died
soon after, she studied sculpture with Alexander Archipenko
for three years. "I gave it up because I wanted a life of my
own, and I couldn't have that and do sculpture," she says.
"It gripped me so."
   Weaving, which she tried next, didn't grip her
immediately. But after spending six weeks with Finnish weaver
Martta Taipale at the Penland School of Crafts in North
Carolina, Ms. Tawney wove "St. Francis and the Birds" in
1954. She used only a hasty sketch and let the structure and
vibrant colors develop on the loom.
   Ms. Tawney had no idea then that she would take the medium
into new paths. She only knew "I had got my hands on
something I could work with, work with what I had inside me."
   The paths appeared quickly, though. The next year she
began making gauzy weavings with areas of open warp. "What
happened was that as I was weaving, the warp began to hang in
places looser than the woven part. I thought to myself, `It
won't be any good.' Then I thought, `But I don't have to show
it to anybody, it's just for myself.' And I felt so free]"
   She began moving away from color, and after relocating to
New York City in 1961, she threw out all her colored yarns
and ordered great quantities of black, white and natural
linen thread. She had the idea to weave contoured forms that
would "go up."
   "I wanted them to be aspiring," she says, eyes closed,
hands moving slowly up and over her head.
   The narrow weavings, 11 to 27 feet tall, which she calls
woven forms, turned the fiber world upside down. They still
startle. Standing in the window of the American Craft Museum,
they look like human figures, perhaps actors in a play
waiting for the lights to go up.
   She had always worked on a large scale, but a series of
"Shields," also begun in the 1960s, were small, elegant
squares or rectangles (the largest is 24 by 16 inches) of
gold, orange or beige linen made three-dimensional by manes
of fringe and discreetly worked in feathers, porcupine quills
and pre-Columbian beads.
   The primitive feeling such non-fiber objects give her work
is no accident. Ms. Tawney has traveled extensively in Spain,
South America, the Near and Far East, North Africa and India.
Primitive objects, she says, "are not made as art, they're
made as offerings, they're made as sacrifices. All my work is
like that too. It comes from my heart, it comes from love.
There's a lot of intellectual art out there, but that's not
me."
   The Santa Rosa cloud sculpture was one such offering,
conceived during a severe drought in 1977. (It rained after
she made the piece.) The show has two other "Clouds," a small
pink and beige one and a huge piece that fills the stairwell:
The threads change color midway down, from light to dark
beige, and the field of knots and loose ends quiver like
hundreds and hundreds of spiders. Seen from underneath, the
"Cloud" looks like rain.
   If sculpture had once seemed too hard for her to handle,
with these clouds, it had sneaked back into her life and
taken her over. In the 1970s, she made assemblages in boxes
and collages on paper, frequently using pages from old books
in foreign languages, splashing them with watercolor or
tearing them into tiny pieces. Although words are everywhere
in this work, they are mostly illegible, and Ms. Tawney
rarely knows what they mean. "I have many old books, and I
don't care what they say. I like the paper and the printing."
   She also filled the boxes, and later whole chests, with
eggs, pictures of owls, a pear, handsome paper, clear
marbles, dead birds, a baby's moccasin. "I had all this stuff
in my loft, and I thought, `I'll just put it in these
chests.' Of course, it didn't make a dent."
   A visit to her Manhattan loft is a little like being
inside one of her collages. The walls, ceiling and floors are
painted white, but the vast space is hardly austere. Sixteen
stones are arranged on the floor in descending order of size;
old wooden gears fill a dresser top; hat forms (some
decorated with feather faces and linen braids) stand on
shelves; broken eggshells from many breakfasts have been
tossed into a basket, etc. A recording of an Indian chant
plays in the background, and pictures of her guru, a
beautiful Indian woman, are taped to pillars, walls and the
fridge.
   Into all this marvelous clutter floats Ms. Tawney, in
white Indian trousers and a blue silk tunic, her hair cropped
short except for a tiny braid in back. She says little but
opens many drawers and cupboards. In a drawer of a private
chest, one not yet made into a "Collage Chest," are two whale
teeth, some bone buttons and a folded paper packet marked "my
hair." In a cupboard is a carton of a dozen "mended eggs"
repaired with scraps of antique book paper. "I ate them and
then I mended them. Now who would have thought of that but
me?" she asks.
