   SmithKline Beecham PLC, a health, household products and
pharmaceuticals concern, said first-quarter pretax profit
dropped 6.8% to #219 million ($365.8 million) compared with
#235 million in the year-earlier period.
   The first-quarter results are the first reported on a
quarterly basis since the group was formed through a July
1989 merger. Year-earlier figures were presented as if the
merger had taken place at the beginning of 1989. The concern
was formed from Beecham PLC and SmithKline Beckman Corp.

market expectations.
   In the quarter, the company had nearly #1.5 billion of
debt compared with #2.4 billion a year ago.
   The company predicts a first-quarter dividend of 3.4
pence. The dividend, to be announced next week at the
concern's annual general meeting, will be paid to
