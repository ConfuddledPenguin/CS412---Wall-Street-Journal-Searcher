   BANK OF JAPAN'S WARNING

   The steady rise in Japanese land prices in the late 1980s
could reverse and trigger widespread financial problems, the
Bank of Japan warned.
   History doesn't bear out a view common in Japan "that land
prices will keep climbing and never decline," the central
bank cautioned in a report. That sense of inevitability is
driving economic decisions and threatens the economy, the
bank said.
   The bank urged legal and tax reforms to end incentives for
property speculation. In the meantime, it said, financial
institutions must be monitored to ensure that a tumble in
land prices doesn't lead to upheaval in the financial system
and undermine the value of the yen.
   Cases in the U.S. and Britain show that when land prices
rise steeply over a short time, they may turn lower again,
the bank noted. "Experiences abroad suggest that it is
important to forestall any turbulence which might arise from
a sudden change in land prices, in order to maintain a safe
and sound financial system," the bank concluded.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN COUNTERATTACK
                                                                                                       

   Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans criticized the
U.S. for having a "high moral tone" on trade practices. Mr.
Evans told the Australian Senate that U.S. criticism of
Australian trade practices was hardly fair in view of some of
the U.S.'s own practices. Australia has complained about U.S.
grain subsidies to the Soviet Union, which it said undercut
its own market. The foreign minister's comments followed
questioning about a report last month in which the U.S.
criticized Australia's tariff regime and customs evaluation,
among other practices.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN UNEMPLOYMENT
                                                                                                       

   Official unemployment in East Germany nearly doubled in
April to 64,948 job seekers from 38,313 people the previous
month, the East German state news agency ADN reported. The
news agency also said 48,858 people had registered with the
state seeking unemployment compensation. Of the nearly 65,000
jobless East German people seeking employment, 12,000 were
school leavers, while 36,000 were skilled workers and 16,000
were unskilled.
                                                                                                       

   SEOUL BUYS SOVIET URANIUM
                                                                                                       

   Korea Electric Power Corp. signed a contract to buy 390
tons of enriched uranium, valued at about $230 million, from
the Soviet Union, Energy and Resources Minister Lee Hee Il
announced. Mr. Lee said the 10-year contract was signed in
Seoul between the state-run power company and Technadexport,
the Soviet state-run nuclear-related export agency. Korea
Electric operates nine nuclear-power plants and is building
several more. It will be capitalist South Korea's first deal
to import uranium from any East European or communist
country.
                                                                                                       

   BRITISH BANKING SLIPPAGE
                                                                                                       

   The United Kingdom's share of international-banking
business slipped 2% in the first nine months of 1989 to less
than 19.5% of the total, the Bank of England said. The
British central bank, in a report entitled "Developments in
International Banking and Capital Markets in 1989,"
attributed the decline to a number of factors, including "an
absolute fall in local foreign-currency interbank lending."
It also suggested that currency deregulation within the
European Community and enhanced trade within the EC were
leading to a shift in banking activity away from the U.K. and
toward continental Europe.
                                                                                                       

   NO FUNDS TO SOVIETS
                                                                                                       

   Agreement on a $12 billion development bank for East
Europe is expected at the end of May, but no U.S. funds wil
go to Moscow for three years, Treasury Undersecretary David
Mulford told Congress. World Bank and International Monetary
Fund officials said the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, to be located in London, will be headed by
Jacques Attali, an adviser to French President Francois
Mitterand.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S NOMURA SECURITIES
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nomura Securities Co. said it will set up European
headquarters in London in June to oversee its European
subsidiaries. The new company's responsibilities will include
personnel and finance administration for Nomura's European
units, which are spread among the United Kingdom, France,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and
West Germany.
                                                                                                       

   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
                                                                                                       

   Senior officials from the world's industrialized and
developing nations decided to put off for further study a
plan to create a pilot fund that would finance programs
designed to reduce global environmental problems.
   The fund, originally proposed by France, would require
financing of between $300 million and $400 million annually
for three years. France has said it is prepared to put up
$150 million a year for the first three years of the project,
but the U.S. has said it won't participate in the project.
   In a statement released at the end of a meeting of the
joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the officials said that further
work is necessary to develop methods for the World Bank to
assist developing countries to take actions that contribute
to the reduction of global environmental problems.
   In their statement, the officials called on the World Bank
to take steps to expand its existing environmental programs
that contribute to the same objective.

   Italy agreed to give Malta more than $200 million in aid
and to provide helicopters and patrol boats to help combat
drug trafficking through the island nation. . . . In Hungary,
on the first official visit to a Warsaw Pact country by any
member of Britain's royal family, Prince Charles and the
Princess of Wales were shown the regalia of Hungary's defunct
monarchy.
