   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its
ratings on $525 million of Grumman Corp.'s senior and
subordinated debt and preferred stock.
   The rating of Grumman's senior and subordinated debt fell
to Baa-3 from Baa-2 and to Ba-2 from Baa-3, respectively. The
rating of its preferred stock dropped to Ba-2 from Baa-3.
</LP>

   Moody's said it lowered the ratings because it expected
unfavorable conditions in the defense industry to continue to
pressure the Bethpage, N.Y., military contractor's cash flow
for servicing debt.
   Grumman declined to comment.
