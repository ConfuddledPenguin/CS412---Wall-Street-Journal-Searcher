   INTEL Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) -- Frank Gill,
46-year-old vice president and director of sales, was named
president of the Intel Systems Group, the computer systems
operation of this microcomputer products company. Mr. Gill
succeeds Leslie Vadasz, 53, who has indicated he plans to
step down from that post prior to a summer sabbatical. The
company said Mr. Vadasz, who helped the systems group double
its revenue in the four years of his leadership, plans to
return to Intel, in a role yet to be determined, after his
sabbatical.
