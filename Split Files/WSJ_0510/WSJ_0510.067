   To the outside world, John T. "Ipy" Dorrance III is the
eccentric and usually reclusive heir to the Campbell Soup
fortune. But in Wyoming, where he lives on a 17,000-acre
ranch at the foot of Devils Tower National Monument, the
45-year-old Mr. Dorrance is making himself a highly visible
figure.
   Says Phyllis Atchison, a prominent Cheyenne cattle
rancher, "He's becoming a pariah."

   The reason for the notoriety: Mr. Dorrance has proposed to
import and breed hundreds of exotic game animals, including
ibexes, European boars, red deer and arctic wolves (15 exotic
species in all). He believes the plan would be great for his
ranch, part of which could become an exotic zoo to attract
tourists, thus helping the state's economy.
   Besides allowing some animals to be hunted as big-game
trophies, Mr. Dorrance contends, others could be raised in
pens for meat (red deer tenderloin from New Zealand, for
example, sells for $9 a pound), and some of the rare goats on
his list could be used for "weed-control research."
   Hogwash, say the members of the Wyoming Game and Fish
Commission, who recently rejected Mr. Dorrance's plan after
wading through expert testimony and listening at length to
his arguments. The commissioners fear the exotics will escape
and interbreed with native deer, antelope, elk and other
species. They also cite the risk of spreading exotic
parasites.
   Some ranchers refer to the Dorrance proposal disparagingly
as "Ipy's Dippy Zoo." A cartoonist at the Casper Star-Tribune
depicted a fenced-in Mr. Dorrance with arm outstretched above
a Wyoming Game and Fish sign that reads: "Do Not Feed the
Billionaire."
   Mr. Dorrance's lawyer denounces the commissioners for all
wearing the same color blazer and for behaving in what he
calls "a group-think mode." Mr. Dorrance complains that state
officials are inflexible bureaucrats who refuse to talk to
him. But he isn't giving up.
   The wealthy rancher continues to grant radio and newspaper
interviews around the state to spread the word about his
plan. A few days ago, he dropped the arctic wolf from his
plan and filed an appeal in a state court, hoping to overturn
the commission's decision.
   Meanwhile, preparing for the day when his dream comes
true, Mr. Dorrance is erecting an electrified, woven-wire
fence along the perimeter of his vast holdings.
