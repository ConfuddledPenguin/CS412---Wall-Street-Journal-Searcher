   NEW YORK -- Stanley Stahl, the real-estate investor and
hostile bidder for Apple Bancorp Inc., rejected the bank's
proposed standstill agreement and began a proxy fight for
control of the board.
   Mr. Stahl, who controls 30.6% of the parent of Apple Bank
for Savings, has offered $38 a share, or $121.6 million, for
the rest. The bank has rejected the tender offer, and the two
sides have filed suits against each other.

   The bank recently proposed an accord under which it would
give confidential nonpublic data about Apple to Mr. Stahl. In
return, the investor would have agreed not to boost his stake
or make an offer for Apple for two years without the board's
consent.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, however,
Mr. Stahl called the terms of the agreement "unacceptable."
The investor also has proposed to expand Apple's board to 21
members from 12, and he is seeking to elect 13 of the 21
directors. He had said in November that he had planned a
proxy fight for the board.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Apple shares rose 62.5 cents, to close at $43.75.
   An Apple spokesman could not be reached for comment.
