   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. said
first-quarter gold production and higher prices helped its
first-quarter profit quadruple to $2.4 million or 24 cents a
share, from $628,000, or 6 cents a share.
   Total revenue edged up 2%, to $14,363,000, from
$14,055,000 in last year's first quarter, the mining concern
said.

operations from year-ago levels, the company added.
