   Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equity operations
for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said that he was encouraged by
the market's late afternoon recovery as it became apparent
the auction of 10-year Treasury notes was successful. The
composite index hit an intraday low of 430.82 before firming
slightly.
   Mr. Da Puzzo suggests that today will be quiet, as
investors pull back and wait for the auction of 30-year
Treasury bonds and tomorrow's figures on retail sales and the
producer price index. "The 30-year auction will be key to
what happens in the equity market," he noted. He remains
bullish about both secondary and blue-chip stocks, predicting
the Dow Jones Industrial Average will hit a record high this
summer.
   The technology sector remained in vogue, with Sun
Microsystems in the forefront. Sun rose 2 1/2 to 28 3/8 on

computer workstation next week.
   Among other technology shares, Intel rose 1/4 to 43 1/4,

stocks, including many large technology issues, rose 0.52, or
0.12%, to 430.86.
   Investors embraced an initial public offering of 1.87
million shares of RasterOps, a Santa Clara, Calif., designer
and maker of color imaging products. Offered at $12 a share,
the stock remained unchanged at 14 7/8, with more than two
million shares changing hands.
   National Media was among the day's most-active issues,
rising 1/2 to 9 3/4 on 1.3 million shares. Stephen Axelrod,
analyst at Denver-based Stuart James, raised his earnings
estimates for the Philadelphia provider of direct-marketing
services. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report, Mr. Axelrod cited the company's success with a new
television marketing format in his estimate that National
Media will report earnings of $1 a share for the year ended
March 31 and his projection of $1.50 to $2.50 a share in
fiscal 1991.

first-quarter loss after taking a charge of nearly $300
