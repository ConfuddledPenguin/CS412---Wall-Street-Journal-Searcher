   FREMONT, Calif. -- Sigma Designs Inc. said profit for the
fiscal-first quarter ended April 30 was "significantly below"
the $1.6 million, or 27 cents a share, reported for the
fiscal-fourth quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Sales of approximately $10 million fell below the $12
million posted in the fourth quarter, the computer-graphics
company said. In last year's first quarter, Sigma posted
profit of $3.1 million, or 49 cents a share, on sales of
about $26 million.

   The company blamed the unfavorable forecast on a reduction
in revenue from Zenith Data Systems and weak demand from
other customers.
