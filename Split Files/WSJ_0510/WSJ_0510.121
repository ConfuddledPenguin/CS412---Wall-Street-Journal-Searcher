   OAKLAND, Calif. -- DNA Plant Technology Corp. said its
joint venture with Du Pont Co. has begun to sell the
venture's VegiSnax line of carrots and celery through 400
supermarkets in the Pacific Northwest.
   At its annual meeting here, DNA Plant Technology also said
the venture, called FreshWorld Inc., is selling the carrots
and celery through about 40 McDonald's restaurants in what
the company called an "operational test" that isn't as broad
as a regular market test. In the restaurants, the vegetables,
produced by advanced growing techniques meant to impart
better taste and longer shelf life, carry the McDonald's
brand name.

   DNA Plant, based in Cinnaminson, N.J., said it also has
started a joint venture with European investors to test
naturally occurring bacteria that may prevent frost damage
when applied to crops. The company said the bacteria, a
strain of Pseudomonas syringe, don't produce a protein that
serves as a site for ice crystal formation, as other natural
bacteria strains do.
