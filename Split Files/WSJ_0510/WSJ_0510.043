   When the Evening News hits the streets Monday in Kansas
City, Mo., owner Stephen F. Rose will be trying to do the
seemingly impossible: successfully launch a metropolitan
daily newspaper and publish it in the afternoon.
   Mr. Rose, president of Sun Publications Inc., Overland
Park, Kan., will publish the Evening News Monday through
Friday, hitting newsstands about 2 p.m. The 50-cent tabloid
newspaper will be heavy on international and national news,
and sports.

   The Evening News will operate as a unit of Sun
Publications, a family-owned publisher of 18 suburban weekly
newspapers in the affluent suburbs of Kansas City's Johnson
County, as well as publisher of the Kansas City Jewish
Chronicle.
   Mr. Rose is attempting to buck a nationwide trend: the
steady decline of metropolitan evening newspapers. The number
of evening dailies has shrunk from 1,450 in 1950 to 1,125 in
1989. Some evening papers have simply died, though many -- at
least 140 since 1976 -- have converted from p.m. to a.m.
newspapers, according to the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   News of startup city newspapers is so rare that recent
attempts have drawn wide publicity, but no success. On April
25, Ingersoll Publications Co. closed down the St. Louis Sun,
a colorful tabloid newspaper started with great fanfare only
seven months before, citing slow growth of circulation and
costly home delivery.
   Mr. Rose's plan for the Evening News has different twists.
In St. Louis, Mr. Ingersoll spent millions on home delivery;
The Evening News will have no home delivery. It will be sold
instead from street vending machines, at convenience stores,
and by newsboys on street corners. Initial circulation goals
are 25,000 daily.
   The St. Louis Sun also went head-to-head with Pulitzer
Publishing Co.'s Post-Dispatch, also a morning paper. The
Evening News, however, will fill the afternoon gap left by
the demise March 1 of the Kansas City Star's afternoon
edition.
   The odds on the Evening News's survival are long, despite
Mr. Rose's strategy. "You like to see any one try it, but the
cost of daily newspaper production is pretty heavy to handle
with only circulation revenue," said Paul Kessinger,
consulting director of the Jordan Group, a New York
consulting and media brokerage firm. Daily newspapers
typically get 80% of their revenue from ad linage and 20%
from single-copy and home subscription sales.
