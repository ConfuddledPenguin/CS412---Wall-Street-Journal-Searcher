   To the Bored and Boorish

   Now is the moment of somewhat breathless anticipation on
innumerable campuses across the nation. Fingers are crossed,
small prayers are being uttered to a pantheon of gods, and
reputations stand teetering upon the edge.
   No, not among the graduating seniors. Their fate is
already settled. Most of those being asked to return for
another try have already heard the bad news. Where the future
is still in doubt is in the offices of university presidents
and chancellors. What will their honored guests, the
commencement speakers, produce this time in exchange for
their honorary degrees and/or fees. And how will the students
behave?

   If the past is any guide, they should relax, try to enjoy
it and promise that next year they'll drop the whole thing.
When it comes to the speakers themselves, the colleges will
once more get just about what they deserve, which is to say
that high mediocrity will be the order of the day. Given the
reasons behind the selection of most commencement speakers,
nothing else should be expected. The vast majority are chosen
because they are 1) famous or notorious, 2) rich, 3) wise, at
least by the lights of the selection committee, 4) rich, 5)
of interest for the moment to people who are temporarily in
their early 20s or 6) rich.
   Having been the recipient of a few of those desperate
requests for that oratorical diversion that falls after the
processional and before the recessional, in the time not
otherwise taken by the awarding of diplomas and other bits of
academic bookkeeping, I can testify from experience and
performance. If the speakers are even moderately self-aware,
they know they are irrelevant and are therefore blessedly
brief. If they are so fatuous as to believe that the students
assembled hang in fascinated rapture on their every word,
they will be unbearably long. In either case, to command
Lincoln for a lesser purpose, the world will little note nor
long remember what is said there. Particularly not that
little world of students, parents and friends who make up the
vast majority of every commencement audience.
   Unless things go really badly or extraordinarily well.
Last year, for instance, a noted scientist gave a first-rate
talk at a university that prides itself on its high ranking
on all the usual charts. Everything was first-rate about it,
that is, except the graduates' response, which can best be
described as lowlife vulgar. They talked, they cheered, they
uncorked cheap champagne bottles after unending bottles to
the accompaniment of loud pops and spewing geysers of
well-shaken froth, they waved back and forth and weaved in
and out of the stadium as nature required. They did
everything, in fact, but listen. It was really too bad, since
the speaker had more to offer than much of what they had
heard for the preceding four years, but theirs was also a
crude statement of the obvious. That speaker up there on the
platform might have something to do with the university's
sense of itself, but he had virtually nothing to do with
them. Since they are the children of a boorish era, they
acted accordingly, which only goes to show that not even a
$100,000 education can produce behavior that society does not
routinely demand.
   Not that such behavior is to be understood solely as the
province of uncivilized post-adolescents, lumpen proletariat
with sheepskins, young men and women without a collective
thought or care. It is occasionally the reflection of a
singularly different impulse. That is, there is the
graduation speaker who seems to have only too much to do with
whatever is roiling at least a portion of the student sea at
the time. There has been less of this kind of reaction among
students of late, certainly as compared with the 1960s and
early 1970s, perhaps because college administrations are more
cautious in their selections than they once were.
Self-censorship has proved itself alive and well at more than
one institution when it comes to speakers at graduation and,
unfortunately, at other times during the school year as well.
   Nevertheless, meticulously choreographed and occasionally
rowdy protests of a graduation speaker's allegedly noxious
beliefs and public activities are still not uncommon. Sexism,
racism, capitalism, liberalism, materialism, whateverism --
all these and a dozen other sins can provoke the "just wrath
and indignation" of at least some of the graduates.
   In that regard, it has been a delight to watch from afar
the anachronistic salvos from the ideological trenches over
the selection of First Lady Barbara Bush, as Wellesley's
graduation speaker. The question of whether Mrs. Bush is or
is not a formidable person in her own right -- which on the
evidence, she clearly is -- has been lost in what many
somehow perceive to be a serious debate about the legitimacy
of her selection. That she is primarily a wife and mother is
regarded as an insult by a minority of the students. But just
when it appeared that the protesters had taken out a patent
on the silliest possible form of doctrinaire
self-righteousness, along came the counterprotesters to prove
that humorlessness is no respecter of causes. Someone should
compile the editorials and columns that have been appeared on
this subject over the past two weeks and publish them as a
solemn warning to all who might be tempted to become
editorial essayists. By comparison, anything Mrs. Bush has to
say will seem a miracle of grace and wisdom.
   There have been some stunning moments in the history of
commencements talks, singular exceptions to the rule.
Churchill at Fulton, Mo., invoking the Iron Curtain.
Secretary of State George Marshall outlining at Harvard the
plan for European recovery that was to bear his name. Surely
among the clutch of entertainers, anchormen, financiers,
foundation executives, politicians, corporation CEOs,
clerics, government officials and felons who have already
been announced as graduation speakers this year there will be
one whose writers will produce a memorable idea or two, or
whose own head and fingers will actually construct a proposal
of worth not only to the graduating seniors but to the nation
and world.
   But most won't, just as they don't most of the time in
whatever occupations or professions they inhabit. Knowing
that, the wonder is that so many -- the vast majority of
American colleges and universities -- persist with a
tradition whose time has long since passed. Think what a
relief it would be for the kids not to have to endure yet one
more interlude as a captive audience before receiving their
diplomas. Think about the amount of pressure on
administrators it would relieve each year, no longer forced
to compete for the superstars of commerce, government, arts
and the media with no super-little to say. (Other ways could
be easily found to flatter potential big givers.)
   Man and boy, I've been there more times than I can count,
as graduate, father, friend, speaker and faculty. Man and
boy, I've never thought the game was worth the candle, not
even when it was my candle. The funny thing is, hardly anyone
else does either. If someone would just say that from a
prominent graduation podium this year, the whole thing would
collapse of its own dead weight. The funeral would be without
mourners.
