   SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- ILC Technology Inc. said its
directors authorized the purchase of as many as 300,000
shares of its 2.2 milion common shares outstanding.
Purchases, which are to be made on the open market from time
to time, are a logical part of the company's restructuring
program, ILC said.
