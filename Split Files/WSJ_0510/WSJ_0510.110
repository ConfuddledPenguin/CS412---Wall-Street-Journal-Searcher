   Storage Technology Corp. said it intends to file a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for a planned offering of $125 million of
convertible subordinated debentures due 2015.
   The Louisville, Colo., maker of data-storage products said
it expects to use a substantial amount of the proceeds from
the planned offering to make additional redemptions or
purchases of its 13.5% senior debentures due 1996.
