   PARIS -- British Aerospace PLC and Aerospatiale of France
confirmed they will conduct a five-year study to decide
whether to develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their
jointly produced Concorde.
   The final decision on whether to proceed with a $10
billion dollar production program will be made in 1995,
Aerospatiale President Henri Martre said.

   He said the feasibility study, which would cost about $34
million dollars, would focus on such issues as market
potential, technical factors and environmental protection.
   Mr. Martre said the British and French companies would
welcome cooperation with other industrial powers, including
the U.S., Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan.
   British Airways and Air France together operate 13
Concordes on trans-Atlantic routes. These planes are due for
retirement within 15 to 20 years; the new planes, if
developed, would be ready by about 2005.
   The projected aircraft would be capable of nonstop flights
across the Pacific.
