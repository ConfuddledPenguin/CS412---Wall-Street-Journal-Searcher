   SAN FRANCISCO -- Aca Joe Inc. said a group of current and
former franchisees of the apparel company filed a lawsuit
against it in federal court here.
   The suit charges the company deceived the plaintiffs by
indicating that the company wished to continue operating
franchise outlets, when the company allegedly had decided to
switch to wholesaling operations. Aca Joe labeled the suit as
"without merit," and said it intends to conduct a vigorous
defense.
