   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it is contesting all $5.7
million of fines levied by the Labor Department, which
accused the company of willful safety violations in
connection with explosions that killed 23 workers at a
chemical plant outside Houston.
   Phillips, of Bartlesville, Okla., had until today to
respond to the citations made by the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration on April 19.

   The explosion at the oil company's Pasadena, Texas,
petrochemical plant last October was one of the nation's
worst postwar industrial accidents. It followed an 18-month
rash of fires and other accidents at numerous petrochemical
plants and oil refineries and has sparked keen interest in
industrywide safety and operating procedures.
   But Phillips strongly disagreed with any assertions that
its operations were unsafe. "Based on our investigation, we
are convinced that this accident took place because of a
single, isolated departure from a clearly established
procedure," said C.J. Silas, Phillips's chairman. "It did not
result from a failure in safety management at the complex, as
stated in OSHA's report."
   The company said that it was most concerned by OSHA's
allegation that it "willfully endangered" the safety of plant
workers. "This simply was not and will never be the case,"
Mr. Silas said.
   Phillips also said it would challenge the legality of the
method OSHA used to arrive at one of the largest fines in the
agency's history. OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful
violations, which is equal to the number of workers that were
on site during the explosion. It then, in effect, moved to
fine the company $10,000 for each of those workers.
   In recent years, OSHA came under criticism from safety
experts for what they considered innocuous fines, sometimes
just hundreds of dollars even when the death of a worker was
involved. But more recently it has taken a stronger stance,
and especially since Gerard Scannell took over last year as
head of the agency.
   According to Phillips's account of the accident, highly
flammable gases escaped from a polyethylene reactor and then
were ignited "as a result of violation of a procedure" during
routine maintenance. Phillips conducted an internal
investigation that said there were three safety steps, and
that if any one of them had been followed the accident
wouldn't have occurred.
   The first was the employment of a so-called lock-out
device, which if used would have prevented a crucial valve
from being opened, Phillips said. Another set of valves
controlling air hoses that, in turn, activate that other
crucial valve were supposed to be closed, the company said.
And the hoses are supposed to be disconnected, Phillips
maintained. Phillips said its investigation found that none
of these procedures was followed.
   Fish Engineering &amp; Construction Inc., a Houston-area
contractor that has worked at the Phillips plant for 17
years, said it notified OSHA last week that it was contesting
proposed penalties of $730,000. "We expect to overturn (the
penalties) on appeal," said an attorney representing Fish.
Four of the people killed in the explosion and 52 of the more
than 130 people injured worked for Fish.
