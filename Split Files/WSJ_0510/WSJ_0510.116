   DALLAS -- Integra-A Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co. said it and
several other companies signed agreements that would raise
new capital and allow Hallwood Group Inc. and affiliates to
sell their 13% stake in Integra.
   Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said it expects
the agreements to lead to a shake-up of its board and to
substantial changes in the company's management. They would
also lead Hallwood, a New York merchant bank and Integra's
biggest shareholder, to substantially end its relationship
with the company, Integra said.

   Integra said Burrus Investment Group Inc., New Orleans,
agreed to make a $10 million, five-year secured loan with an
interest rate of four percentage points above the prime rate.
The agreement also calls for Integra to give Burrus six-year
warrants to buy as many as 1.8 million shares of Integra
common for 46.25 cents each.
   An affiliate of Burrus, meanwhile, agreed to purchase
578,763 Integra shares, or 6.5% of total common shares
outstanding, from Hallwood, according to Integra.
   Separately, Integra said a unit of Westbrooke Hospitality
Corp., a Dallas hotel operator, agreed to provide centralized
hotel operating services to most hotels currently operated by
Integra. Integra would receive an option to acquire the
subsidiary between 1993 and 1995.
   Also, 867 Jennings Investment Co., a private company owned
by a relative of a Westbrooke principal, agreed to purchase a
6.5% Integra stake from Hallwood, Integra said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Integra closed at 46.87 cents a share, up 3.12 cents.
