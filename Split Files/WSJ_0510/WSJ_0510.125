   ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL OF TRINITY CHURCH, a house of worship
since 1766, is an oasis of calm amid the bustle of New York's
Wall Street area. Here, 64 volunteers, mostly white-collar
professionals from nearby brokerage firms and banking houses,
take turns working with 10 homeless men.
   Typical is Martyna Gerweck, a financial operations vice
president for R.C. Forbes &amp; Co., a securities firm. Two or
three times a month, she spends an evening at St. Paul's with
the church's "guests," offering conversation, a game of cards
and friendship. "The guys become my pals and they stay in
touch after they move on to their own housing," says Ms.
Gerweck.
   The Chapel -- where 10 cots, a bathroom, small kitchenette
and lounge are in a two-story area under the steeple, out of
view of the pews where George Washington once worshiped -- is
a microcosm of the many private, often small shelters set up
around the country since the early 1980s to accommodate the
homeless and unemployed, offering a way station for those
seeking permanent housing.
   Joseph Pickard, a 29-year-old Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
lawyer, has been volunteering about 15 hours a month at the
Chapel for the past year -- taking the meal shift, an
occasional overnighter or parts of the weekend. "Small as
this contributon may be," he says, "it was the only way I
could relieve the frustrations I started feeling when I saw
the homeless on my way to work."
   He learned about the shelter after responding to a subway
poster ad for the Partnership for the Homeless Inc., a
private, nonprofit group that operates sleep-in shelters in
153 New York City churches and synagogues. Despite the
informal relationship between the volunteers and the
homeless, the shelters run on tight rules: Curfews are
enforced, food cabinets and refrigerators are padlocked until
just before meal times and even the job leads that volunteers
occasionally provide the homeless must be reviewed by the
Partnership.
   Mr. Pickard, and most of the other volunteers at the
Chapel, aren't parishioners of St. Paul's; the site is simply
convenient to their Wall Street offices. They try in various
ways to help the men (it's a male-only shelter), often
bringing in pizzas or donating furniture.
   The aid takes many forms. Laurie Hammel, a Chase Manhattan
vice president and loan officer and a volunteer at the Chapel
for five years, helped some open savings accounts after they
landed jobs.
   Ms. Hammel has seen 25 of the men find their "way out" of
the shelter, where the average stay is nine months. There are
setbacks, though. Ms. Gerweck, the R.C. Forbes officer,
recalls one man who simply wandered away, only to be seen
weeks later living in a park. (Private shelters such as St.
Paul's screen out homeless people with a history of drug
abuse or mental problems, referring them to public
facilities.)
   Most of the homeless men at St. Paul's are glad to be
there. "I was in a city shelter for a month and couldn't
stand seeing guards with rubber gloves," says one of the
Chapel's homeless as he prepares that night's chicken creole
dinner.
