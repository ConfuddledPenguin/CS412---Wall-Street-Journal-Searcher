   MADRID -- Spain's tourism revenue dropped 3.2% in the
first three months of the year to 363.9 billion pesetas
($3.51 billion) from 375.9 billion pesetas ($3.62 billion) a
year earlier, according to the Ministry of Transportation,
Tourism and Communication.
   Tourism, which accounts for nearly 10% of Spain's gross
domestic product, has sagged in recent months after booming
in 1987 and 1988 and stabilizing in 1989.
