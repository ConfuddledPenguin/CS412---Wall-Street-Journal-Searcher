   Art collectors had better be buying for love, not money.
   Disappointing sales at auctions this week in New York,
coming on the heels of lackluster results last month in
London, offer evidence that art, one of the hottest
investments of the 1980s, isn't sure-fire.

   In roughly the past five years, art prices have soared
sky-high, a rapid rate of appreciation that prompted
experienced collectors to become more active, attracted new
collectors to the market, and boosted the number of dealers
and others, particularly in Japan, buying art purely for
speculation.
   But at contemporary-art auctions held at the premiere
art-auction houses in New York this week, about one-third of
the artworks offered for sale failed to find buyers. At
Christie's International PLC, the total sale at Monday
night's auction came to $40.2 million, sharply lower than the
firm's lowest estimate of $50 million. At Sotheby's Holdings
Inc., the total sale at Tuesday night's auction was $55.9
million, well below the $86 million minimum predicted by the
auction house.
   Some sales in April in London of less expensive, less
historically important merchandise also had mixed results.
But the results of all the recent sales are still considered
only early warning signals.
   But what is especially worrisome to the art industry is
that the failures so far have included some high-quality,
multimillion-dollar works by Willem de Kooning, Andy Warhol
and other established artists. Conventional wisdom had held
that, even when the art boom wound down, or outright busted,
the important works would be recession-proof. Recent sales
indicate, art dealers say, that collectors and market players
who believed that might have been both overconfident and
greedy.
   One sculpture by Claes Oldenberg, who was a leading
proponent of 1960s' "Pop Art," sold at Sotheby's a year ago
for $495,000. On Tuesday the work was put on the block again,
and bidding went as high as $525,000 for the plaster, fabric
and wire wall-hanging of an egg and slice of bacon. However,
that price didn't meet the seller's minimum acceptable bid,
and the piece went unsold.
   Many stock-market investors, who had been playing the art
boom by buying shares rather than sculptures, didn't even
wait for this week's sales to render their verdict by selling
Sotheby's stock. The price of the stock, previously one of
Wall Street's star performers, has been sliding since the
April auctions. Yesterday in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the stock opened almost an hour late
because of an imbalance of orders, and down by $2.125 a
share. By the end of the day, the stock had fallen $3.125 to
a 52-week low of $16.50, in more than seven times its normal
trading volume.
   In contrast, the stock of Christie's International PLC,
which is traded in London, closed near its 52-week high
yesterday, at #3.27 ($5.46), down three pence. Christie's
stock is more thinly traded than Sotheby's, and the company
rarely takes a position in the art it is selling.
   Sotheby's, however, effectively underwrote six of the
artworks that went up for bid Tuesday evening by guaranteeing
that the sellers would receive a certain price even if the
art didn't sell. All six did sell -- two for more than the
highest pre-sale estimates and three for less than the lowest
estimates.
   Art dealers, collectors and artists say the art market's
apparent softening is partly due to the twin recessions in
New York's real estate and finance industries. They also
blame a new mood of caution on the part of international
investors sparked by weakness in the Tokyo stock market.
Perhaps most of all, however, they talk about a vague feeling
that the rapid price appreciation of the past few years was
simply too good to last.
   Some argue that a return to earth might not be so bad for
the art market. "Oh, good," said one Impressionist painting
collector, "maybe I can afford something next week."
   For collectors and investors, the lesson is that not even
works of art are immune from the ups and downs of free-market
economics. Until the dust settles, the sidelines may be the
safest place, especially for those who have been thinking
about selling, some collectors and dealers say.
   Still, they caution against making sweeping
generalizations about the health of the market based on the
auctions so far. Several of the arts and collectibles
markets, African art and toys, for example, have set record
prices and shown continued vigor at recent auctions. American
folk art has also been very strong.
   Moreover, the contemporary market "is a trendy and flaky
market," of works by artists "who have not been sorted out by
time," says Samuel Pennington, publisher of Maine Antique
Digest, which has been following the art market since 1973.
"When you have a guy making a parallelogram of string and
calling it sculpture," the fact that it sells or doesn't sell
isn't necessarily indicative of the health of the broader
market.
   Nonetheless, art dealers are, to say the least, on
tenterhooks ahead of the major auctions of the season, the
evening sales of Impressionist and modern paintings, which
will be held at Christie's and Sotheby's next Tuesday and
Thursday, respectively. Those sales are keenly watched
because, in the past, they've set the tone for the art market
world-wide.
   Scheduled to go on the block are two acknowledged
masterpieces, both carrying estimates of $40 million to $50
million, and even higher expectations. Christie's will sell
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," an evocative,
brooding canvas painted in shades of deep blue by the artist
shortly before he committed suicide in 1890. Sotheby's will
sell "Au Moulin de La Gallete," Pierre-Auguste Renoir's
vibrant depiction of a festive Parisian dance hall.
   David Nash, head of the Impressionist and modern paintings
department at Sotheby's, says he's still "confident" that the
price estimates that the company set several months ago, when
the artworks were first consigned to auction, "are still
pretty good." He notes that collectors of Impressionist
paintings tend to be wealthier than most other collectors,
and that many of the works for sale haven't been at auction
in quite some time.
   He adds, however, that some of the sellers have been
calling the company to say "I'm not feeling that bullish
anymore," and are lowering the reserves, or minimum prices
they will accept. Such last-minute cautiousness isn't
uncommon, he adds.
   Traditionally, that minimum acceptable bid is equal to or
slightly less than the lowest presale estimate. But at
Sotheby's contemporary sale Tuesday night, almost one-fourth
of the works that did find buyers sold below the low end of
Sotheby's price estimate, indicating sellers may have lowered
their reserves.
   One Donald Sultan flower painting, for example, sold for
$70,000 instead of the $125,000 to $175,000 it had been
expected to bring.
