   BEDFORD PARK, Ill. -- Dresher Inc. said the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division won't oppose the acquisition
of Dresher by Leggett &amp; Platt Inc.
   Leggett, a maker of furniture and bed parts, launched the
tender offer for the maker of brass beds early last month and
had extended its $2.50-a-share offer to yesterday pending the
agency's decision.
