   Primerica Corp. proposed buying the remainder of the
publicly held stock in American Capital Management &amp; Research
Inc. Primerica already owns 82.6% of American's shares.
   Primerica, a New York financial-services concern, said it
would exchange 0.3 share of its common stock for each
American share it doesn't own. American has a total of 24.4
million shares outstanding.

   The company said it would issue 1,270,000 million new
shares to complete the transaction. Based on Primerica's
recent stock price, the transaction's value would be $38
million.
   American Capital Management, Houston, provides investment
advice to mutual funds and closed-end investment companies,
with a total of $12.8 billion in assets under management as
of March 31. Its business has been hurt recently by an
oversupply of mutual funds and slumping stock and bond
prices.
   The transaction is subject to the approval of both
companies' boards.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Primerica
was unchanged at $29.625 a share; American Capital closed at
$9.125 a share, up 75 cents.
