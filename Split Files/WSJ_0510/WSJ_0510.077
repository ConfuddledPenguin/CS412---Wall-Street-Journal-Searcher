   Medical researchers in two independent studies found that
the experimental drug DDI lowers virus levels and enhances
immune cells in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex
(ARC).
   The two safety studies of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
compound found that DDI's side effects include a painful
neuropathy, or nerve damage, to the feet, and pancreatitis,
an inflammation of the pancreas. But such side effects mostly
occurred at doses now considered too high. Moreover, they
didn't provoke the kind of blood problems caused by Wellcome
PLC's AZT, the only approved antiviral for AIDS.

   "This is a drug of considerable promise, but one that has
associated toxicity, as all drugs do," said Raphael Dolin,
professor of medicine at the University of Rochester (N.Y.)
School of Medicine, and a lead author of one study. "The
exact place of DDI in the armamentarium of drugs for treating
AIDS will depend upon the outcome of current Phase Two, or
efficacy studies." Such studies now are under way.
   "You have to be cautiously optimistic," said a lead author
of the other study, Timothy P. Cooley, assistant professor of
medicine at Boston University. Although the point of the
studies was to assess toxicity and find the safe-dosage
ceiling, he said, "We have some soft evidence of clinical
benefit." Hard proof awaits conclusion of the efficacy
trials, which could take up to a year to complete.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bristol-Myers Squibb stock rose 50 cents a share, closing at
$58.50.
   Despite the good news, an editorial accompanying the two
reports, published in today's edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine, urges eager patients and doctors to
"suspend judgment" about DDI until all the evidence is in
hand.
   "There is a promise here of efficacy," said the
editorial's author, Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But we must
reserve any conclusions" until the end of efficacy studies.
   What encourages researchers most about today's published
reports is the finding that even at the lowest dosage levels,
DDI suppressed the level of an AIDS viral protein, called
p24, a common marker for disease progression. It also
prompted significant and in some cases sustained rises in the
levels of T4 lymphocytes, which are disease-fighting white
blood cells of the immune system. Taken together, the two are
used as the most common lab measure of the disease's
progression or improvement.
   In addition, many patients exhibited increased appetites
and weight gains of about two to four pounds, along with more
subjective measurements, such as an improved sense of
well-being. However, both reports warn that such findings
don't ensure long-term clinical benefits and improved
survival.
   DDI's development has been marked by high hope as well as
anxiety in the AIDS community, which urgently needs more
drugs to augment the limited AIDS armory. So far, the only
approved antiviral drug, AZT, induces bone marrow supression
and anemia in about half the patients who take it. Also,
long-term AZT use gives rise to mutant viruses that no longer
respond to AZT. Recent test-tube studies indicate that these
mutant viruses respond to DDI.
   An intense patient lobbying effort last year sought and
won expanded access to DDI in a giveaway program now running
concurrently with ongoing efficacy studies. So far, about 900
patients are in the Phase Two studies. About 6,100 patients,
most too ill to qualify for the studies, receive DDI under
the expanded-access program.
   Safety concerns erupted earlier this year after a
newspaper reported a higher number of deaths within the
expanded-access group than in the study. Researchers
attributed the deaths to the inexorable progression of AIDS
among sicker patients in the expanded-access group. Still,
certain academics criticized the giveaway as too hasty.
   About 13 deaths have been linked with DDI-induced
pancreatitis, though researchers don't fully understand how
it is caused. Pancreatitis is often traced to alcohol and
certain other drugs, including pentamidine, a popular
preventative for AIDS-linked pneumonia. Doctors were warned
in the journal reports to remove patients from DDI at the
first sign of toxic effects.
   Researchers are urging doctors to monitor patients' blood
for elevated pancreatic enzymes, which can precede an attack
of pancreatitis, and then "cut back or stop the drug," said
Dr. Dolin. His report noted that AIDS itself causes subtle
pancreatic damage that may be exacerbated by DDI.
   Other toxicities included raised blood levels of uric acid
and liver enzymes, which have yet to provoke clinical
problems but "could become important in a larger population,"
Dr. Cooley cautioned.
   The drug's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, is pressing
ahead with development and expressing general optimism to
members of the financial community. The drug has been given
the brand name Videx, executives told analysts recently. In
addition to potential usefulness against AZT-resistant
viruses, the drug also has the advantage of longer activity
in the body, which means that patients can take it less
frequently.
   Saying DDI's efficacy looks comparable to that of AZT at a
similar stage of development, the company confidently
forecasts filing a new drug application with the Food and
Drug Administration by the end of the year.
