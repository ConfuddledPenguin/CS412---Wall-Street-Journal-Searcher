   NEW YORK -- A major accounting firm, criticized for
alleged soft treatment of some former clients of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., is suddenly playing hardball with
Drexel clients.
   Touche Ross &amp; Co., which merged with Deloitte, Haskins &amp;
Sells in December to form Deloitte &amp; Touche, the
third-largest U.S. accounting firm, had long been the auditor
for a raft of Drexel clients. Drexel, which filed for
bankruptcy-court protection in February, was the originator
of junk bonds and sold millions of dollars of them to Touche
clients. Touche had been criticized by some attorneys as
permitting these clients to stretch accounting rules to
produce better financial results for portfolios of the
high-risk, high-yield bonds.

   But suddenly Deloitte &amp; Touche, which audits about 65 of
the 300 biggest U.S. thrifts, is forcing former Drexel
clients to take write-downs over deteriorating junk bonds or
real-estate holdings or by questioning the clients' internal
controls. One result has been a tighter squeeze on some
thrifts already struggling to survive.
   "Touche has gotten some religion because it doesn't want
to be burned in court again," said Daniel Mogin, a San Diego
attorney representing shareholders who have sued Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan Association and Touche over an allegedly
overblown valuation of the thrift's junk bonds bought from
Drexel. The suit, alleging that investors bought Columbia
common stock based on the inflated value of the junk bonds,
was filed in federal district court in Los Angeles in
December.
   Edward Kangas, managing partner of Deloitte &amp; Touche and
former managing partner of Touche, says that Touche hasn't
become any tougher with former Drexel clients than current
economics or new laws dictate. "The junk-bond market didn't
begin to fall apart until last October," Mr. Kangas said.
"Prior to that, there were daily quotes in The Wall Street
Journal citing the value of these bonds, and these are what
our auditors adhere to."
   Deloitte &amp; Touche ordered Columbia Savings after last
year's fourth quarter to incur about $50 million in
write-downs on the value of equity securities that Columbia
had received from Drexel for buying junk bonds. As a result,
Columbia, which tried to delay the write-down until the first
quarter of this year, couldn't meet federal standards for
assets and declared itself insolvent last month.
   J. Michael Cook, chairman and chief executive of Deloitte
&amp; Touche, says that a law passed in July -- the Financial
Institutions Reform &amp; Recovery Act -- that became effective
in December mandated that thrifts must dispose of their junk
bonds over the next five years. "This meant that all of a
sudden, these portfolios had to be marked to market rather
than being held at amortized cost," he said.
   By starting to require thrifts to market such junk-bond
holdings to market last December, "we were simply responding
to the new law," Mr. Cook says. He says that other downward
revisions of profits for thrifts audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche
have resulted from real estate collapses in Arizona, Florida
and the Northeast.
   Deloitte &amp; Touche forced Great American Bank, a San Diego
thrift, to boost its reserve for nonperforming loans in the
fourth quarter by $87 million, resulting in a net loss of
$59.3 million in the quarter, mostly from write-downs of
Arizona real estate. Great American, the eighth-biggest U.S.
thrift, has said it disputed the auditor's request for such
big reserves and is now seeking to be acquired as a rescue
operation to continue in business under higher capital
standards mandated by federal regulators in December.
   And Deloitte &amp; Touche was fired last month by Financial
Corp. of Santa Barbara, parent of Santa Barbara Savings &amp;
Loan Association, which was taken over by federal regulators
soon afterward. Financial Corp. said it discharged the
auditor after the accounting firms refused to issue an
opinion concerning the thrift's 1989 financial satatement due
to "material weakness in internal controls."
   The flap involved problems with the thrift's conversion
last year to a new computer system, which was plagued with
start-up problems, according to Financial Corp.'s 10-K
filings with the the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"We're still scratching our heads, wondering why Touche
judged the usual problems encountered in most computer
conversions as being serious enough to deny us an opinion on
our financial statement," says David Heaberlin, executive
vice president and chief financial officer of Financial Corp.
   Prior to playing hardball with its clients, Touche was
criticized for being too lax with some Drexel clients. In the
class-action suit filed against Columbia Savings and Touche
by Columbia shareholders, the plaintiffs allege that Touche
violated professional standards by permitting Columbia to
overvalue its junk bonds and to set too low a reserve for
possible future trading losses.
   Columbia Savings, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara and
Great American Bank of San Diego were all clients of both
Drexel and Touche.
   In the Columbia case, the lawsuit against the thrift and
Touche notes that Touche had been a longstanding "accountant
of choice" for numerous Drexel clients such as Integrated
Resources Inc., Reliance Financial Services Corp. and First
Executive Corp. A class action suit was filed against
Intregrated, Drexel and Touche last June in federal district
court in New York. The suit alleges that Touche permitted
Integrated, which filed for bankruptcy court protection last
February, to overstate its income and assets -- a charge that
Touche denies.
   Mr. Kangas says that Drexel never referred any of its
clients to Touche as clients. "Many Drexel clients were
clients of ours long before junk bonds were invented by
Drexel," he adds. For example, he says both Integrated and
Reliance became Touche clients in the early 1970s and First
Executive in the mid-1960s.
   Mr. Mogin, an attorney with Milberg, Weiss, Bershad,
Specthrie &amp; Lerach, which is representing Columbia Savings
investors who claim they lost money by investing in the
thrift's common shares, says that Touche played a key role in
Columbia's alleged scheme to defraud shareholders.
   "At the height of the junk-bond frenzy, Columbia in 1988
had a junk-bond portfolio worth about $6 billion," Mr. Mogin
says. Last Dec. 31, that portfolio was worth only $3.8
billion. In last year's third quarter, the thrift set up a
reserve against junk-bond losses of $227.3 million and wrote
down its junk-bond holdings by $130.2 million.
   "Why did Touche permit Columbia to set up only a $45
million reserve against junk-bond losses for 1987 and 1988?"
Mr. Mogin asks. "It was obvious that Columbia was trading in
and out of its junk bonds and under accounting rules, the
value of the bonds should have been marked to market prior to
last year," Mr. Mogin says. Federal regulators say that from
the beginning of 1986 to the end of 1988, there was an 80%
turnover in Columbia's junk-bond portfolio.
   "We didn't perceive that Columbia was holding its
junk-bond portfolio for trading, which would have meant they
would have had to be marked to market rather than held at
amortized cost as in an investment account," says Mr. Kangas
of Touche. "A lot of these junk bonds have short maturities,
ranging from two to 10 years, and it's natural to have this
sort of turnover, even in an investment account."
   But Mr. Kangas maintains that only by last October did it
become obvious that both Drexel and the junk-bond market
"were falling apart." He adds: "That's why we required
Columbia to take the write-down in the fourth quarter of last
year. The market for junk bonds changed and anyone who says
we should have been able to predict it doesn't know what he's
talking about."
