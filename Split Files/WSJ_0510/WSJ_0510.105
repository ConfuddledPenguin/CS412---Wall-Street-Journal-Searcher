   In an organizational change, CSC Consulting's European
operations will report to company Chairman William R. Hoover
rather than to the consulting group.
   Mr. Crowley was chairman of CSC Partners Inc., a Waltham,
Mass., consulting concern, which he co-founded in 1976 and
was acquired by CSC Consulting in 1986.
   The company also named James A. Champy senior vice
president of CSC Consulting, a newly created position. Mr.
Champy, 48, will continue to serve as chairman of the Index
Group, the Cambridge, Mass., consulting concern founded by
Mr. Gerrity and acquired in 1988 by CSC Consulting.
