   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said a federal court ordered a
direct-marketing company and its principals to pay it
$876,225 in damages and attorney fees for copyright
infringement.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Parsippany, N.J., said Chief Judge
Barefoot Sanders, of the U.S. District Court in Dallas, ruled
that Southwest Data Processing Inc., Bedford, Texas,
infringed the copyright of Dun's Marketing Services, a unit
that licenses a data base containing information on nearly
nine million companies.

   Dun's Marketing Services alleged in November that
Southwest Data and principals Walter H. Cushman and Rodney L.
Holloman were selling unauthorized copies of the data base.
   Mr. Cushman denies any wrongdoing but said he can't afford
to appeal the judge's order. As a result of the legal fight,
Mr. Cushman said, Southwest Data "is in the process of filing
for bankruptcy."
