   Slumping bond prices and a plunging dollar kept stock
prices from posting an eighth consecutive gain.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a scant 0.68 point
to 2732.88 in moderately active trading. Long-term bond
prices fell despite a good response to the Treasury's sale of
$10 billion in 10-year notes. The dollar plunged to its
lowest level in two years against the West German mark.

   Bond prices and the dollar set the tone for the day. The
dollar's steep drop against the mark reflected the opinion of
many currency traders that U.S. interest rates may be headed
lower. That opinion is rooted in evidence the U.S. economy is
more sluggish than had been thought and in the success of the
first leg of the Treasury's three-part, $30.5 billion
quarterly refunding auction Tuesday.
   The dollar tumbled to a 28-month low against the West
German mark as news spread that the Bush administration might
be willing to raise some taxes to reduce the U.S. budget
deficit.
   "It was a bad day for the dollar," said Robert Hatcher, a
vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York. "The market
feels that if Bush is inclined to hike taxes and reduce the
budget deficit, then interest rates in the U.S. can go lower.
Some of the hot money started to leave." Lower interest rates
generally tend to reduce a currency's allure to international
investors and speculators. Over the past two weeks, the
dollar has fallen 3.5% against the mark.
   Bond prices fell because of uncertainty about the outcome
of the remainder of the Treasury's refunding auction.
Although the first sale went well, traders were more
concerned about the sale of 10-year notes yesterday and $10
billion in 30-year bonds today. News that the 10-year notes
sold at an average yield of 8.88% wasn't enough to convince
traders today's 30-year auction would go as well.
   The weakness in the dollar and bond prices spread to
stocks early in the day. The Dow industrials were off about
13 points with less than 30 minutes of trading left when the
results of the note sale were announced. Some
computer-assisted buy programs were triggered, recouping
nearly all the lost ground by the close. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index eked out a small gain.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices were mixed. Volume totaled 152.2 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where gaining issues
outnumbered decliners 760 to 733.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar plunged against the mark. In late New York
trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6360 marks, down from
1.6573 Tuesday, and at 156.60 yen down from 157.62 yen
Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. The
yield on the issue climbed to 8.86%.
