   The battle for dominance in the $8 billion-a-year
international express-delivery market is heating up again.
   Three companies -- Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa German
Airlines and Nissho Iwai Corp., a leading Japanese trading
company -- confirmed yesterday that they are negotiating to
acquire a stake in DHL Worldwide Express, the world's largest
international express-delivery concern.

   While officials at DHL International, the Brussels-based
holding company, declined to comment, industry analysts say
such a marriage would increase the pressure on Federal
Express Corp. and closely held United Parcel Service, both of
which have been pushing hard to expand their operations
overseas.
   "With this move, Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa are saying
to Federal Express and United Parcel Service, `We're not
going to let you waltz in {our} markets uncontested,' " said
Edwin Laird, director of Air Cargo Management Group, a
Seattle consulting firm. "In other words, the ante has just
been upped."
   News of the DHL negotiations helped push down Federal
Express's stock $1.50 a share, to $52.125, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   But some observers play down the threat to Federal
Express. "I suspect that DHL has worked with {Japan Air Lines
and Lufthansa} before, so there would be some benefits on the
cost side but little change in terms of marketing clout,"
said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "This
amounts to just more jockeying for position, so we expect
that it will be business as usual at Federal."
   Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., declined to
comment, as did UPS, based in Greenwich, Conn.
   Officials at Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa and Nissho Iwai
all said they were seeking minority holdings, but declined to
elaborate. People familiar with the negotiations, however,
said that a deal was imminent and could result in the
outsiders gaining majority control with a 60% stake. The
three companies' initial investment would total about $500
million and would be limited to DHL's international
operations, the people said.
   "The global freight market is booming, and this looks like
a logical partnership" said Martin White of Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Associates Ltd., a management consulting firm. "DHL needs
air-freight capacity, and JAL and Lufthansa need its
world-wide distribution services."
   Founded in 1969 by three American entrepreneurs -- Larry
Hillblom, Adrian Dalsey and Robert Lynn -- DHL created the
express door-to-door delivery business. It remains a closely
held company controlled by two of its three founders -- Mr.
Lynn is no longer involved in the company. DHL currently
serves 184 countries, while Federal Express operates in 127.
In 1989, DHL carried more than 50 million international
shipments.
   The international market is growing by an estimated 28% a
year-and changing. Most of the expansion is coming in Asia,
where express delivery remains underdeveloped, and in Europe,
spurred by the move toward the 1992 unified market and the
opening of Eastern Europe.
   Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa already are huge cargo
carriers, each ranking in the top five world-wide. The two
airlines joined forces in April, announcing an agreement with
Air France and Cathay Pacific Airways to cooperate on an
aircargo information service. Nissho Iwai also has vast
experience in shipping large volumes of goods, but is
inexperienced in small air-cargo shipments.
   DHL would complement these airport-to-airport or
port-to-port services with door-to-door delivery. The
agreement also would give the Japanese an entry into the
European market and the Germans into the Asian market.
   Indeed, it is the saturated U.S. market that has prompted
Federal Express and UPS to look overseas. Both companies have
invested heavily in building international operations to
offset slower growth in domestic markets. In 1988, Federal
Express agreed to pay $880 million for Tiger International
Inc., then the world's largest air-cargo carrier.
   Investors, however, are still waiting for that move to pay
off. Federal Express's international operations have been
losing an estimated $15 million a quarter, according to Paul
R. Schlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities. He added: "A DHL deal is significant in that
Federal's investment in Tiger is now more at risk."
   But Morgan Stanley's Mr. Murphy says an agreement
involving DHL is more likely to affect other European and
Pacific Rim air carriers that currently transport DHL cargo,
such as Air France and Singapore Air Lines.
   "My guess is that at the end of the day, it's these guys
who will be losing business, not Federal Express," he said.
