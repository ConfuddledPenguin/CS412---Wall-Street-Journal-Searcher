   A federal appeals court narrowed the choices many
investors have when their disputes with brokers go to
arbitration.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
investors nationwide can be required to arbitrate in New
York, rather than in the city in which they live or do
business. The decision -- which involves cases with American
Stock Exchange members before the American Arbitration
Association -- is at odds with the exchange's and the
arbitrators' own policy.

   In a related case, the court also ruled that a customer's
individual brokerage contract takes precedence over Amex's
more general rules about arbitration. The court said that by
signing an individual contract, the customer gives up the
right to arbitrate before the American Arbitration
Association. Instead, investors must use securities-industry
arbitration proceedings specified in the contract. Many
shareholder attorneys consider AAA proceedings to be more
fair to investors.
   Previously, Amex and AAA have allowed investors' cases to
be handled in cities that are convenient for them. But the
federal appeals court in Manhattan, N.Y., said the wording in
the Amex constitution requires that cases before the
arbitration group be handled in New York.
   The Amex provision says that cases can be taken "before
the American Arbitration Association in the city of New
York." The Amex and the arbitrators say the wording merely
describes where the association is based, but the court said
the language of the rule compels that arbitration be held in
New York.
   "The argument that `in the city of New York' is
descriptive is undermined by the fact that, at all relevant
times, there was only one American Arbitration Association,"
the court said in its opinion earlier this week. "The
geographic reference is superfluous if not a forum selection
clause." The panel of appellate judges said the Amex would
have to change the language of the provision if it disagreed
with the court's interpretation.
   The case before the court involves investors who claim
PaineWebber Inc. employees misled them into buying securities
before the price collapsed. The investors wanted to arbitrate
the case in Orlando, Fla., where they live. They were doing
business through PaineWebber's Orlando office.
   Robert Coulson, president of the arbitration association,
said the decision poses an inconvenience for many investors.
"We're sorry that the court seems to have foreclosed access
of the investor to AAA procedures," Mr. Coulson said. "We try
to keep our procedures open to anyone who wants to use them."
The association is a nonprofit public-service group that
arbitrates a wide range of cases, from brokerage disputes to
labor issues.
   Neal Blaher, a lawyer for the investors, said, "It's a
real blow to any fairness for customers." He said many
investors in such proceeding can't afford to take their cases
to New York. Under the decision, arbitration before a
securities-industry proceeding could be held in various
cities -- only investors going before AAA would be required
to arbitrate in New York.
   Scott Noah, an assistant vice president and associate
general counsel for Amex, said the exchange last November
proposed a change in its constitution to make it clear that
it didn't intend to require that AAA cases be arbitrated in
New York. He said the Securities and Exchange Commission has
taken no action on the proposal.
   In the other case, an investor in a dispute with Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. claimed that when it comes
to arbitration, the Amex constitution should preempt
individual brokerage contracts. In affirming a lower court
judge, the appeals court said the investor had agreed to
narrow his arbitration choices by signing the brokerage
contract.

   GEORGIA ELECTION LAW is challenged as discriminatory.
   A class-action suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court
in Atlanta alleges that a 1964 state law requiring candidates
in a primary election to receive more than 50% of the votes
cast to secure their party's nomination dilutes black voting
strength. The plaintiffs, a group of 27 black legislators and
civil-rights leaders, want a candidate to be able to win
primary and general elections with a plurality.
   The suit could affect the 1990 governor's race in Georgia.
The plaintiffs said they intend to seek a preliminary
injunction to prevent a runoff in the July 17 Democratic
gubernatorial primary. No runoff is expected in the
Republican primary.
   The suit is the second major challenge to Georgia's
election laws in federal court. A related case involves
allegations that the state's method of electing superior
court judges from multi-county circuits dilutes black voting
strength. In these wide geographic areas, voters select more
than one judge for the region. Such elections can dilute a
voting group's power if that group is a minority within the
circuit.
   In contrast, single-judge districts give neighborhoods
sole power to select the judge for that district.

   HOSPITAL'S FIRING of therapist turned photographer is
upheld.
   The case involved photographs of toddler Jessica McClure,
the Midland, Texas, girl who captured national attention in
October 1987 when she was trapped in an abandoned well for 58
hours.
   A respiratory therapist working at Midland Memorial
Hospital shot photographs of Jessica as she was brought into
the hospital's emergency room after her rescue and sold the
photos to the New York Times.
   The hospital fired the therapist, John Brennan, for
violating hospital policy governing the release of
information about patients. The therapist, who argued that he
had the permission of Jessica's mother to shoot the
photographs, filed suit in state district court in Midland,
alleging that he was deprived of property and liberty
guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. The original suit also
alleged wrongful discharge and breach of contract, but those
claims were later withdrawn.
   State District Judge Vann Culp of Midland granted the
hospital's motion for summary judgment on the constitutional
question and dismissed the therapist's suit last week.
   The hospital was represented by labor law specialists
Christopher Knepp and Grace Renbarger of the Austin office of
Dallas-based Hughes &amp; Luce.
   Barry L. Hart, the Odessa, Texas, lawyer representing the
therapist, said his client hasn't decided whether to appeal
Judge Culp's decision.

   FOOTBALL PLAYERS gain support of state officials in high
court.
   The attorneys general of eight states, including New York,
Texas, Michigan and Utah, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to
hear an appeal by National Football League players in an
antitrust suit against the league. The players are objecting
to NFL rules restricting player movement among teams.
   Last November, the Eighth U.S. Court of Appeals in St.
Louis ruled that federal labor law made the NFL immune from
the players' antitrust suit as long as the players' union
remained as a collective-bargaining agent. In response to the
decision, the union ended its status as a bargaining agent.
   In a brief filed this week, the states argued that the
appeals court decision narrows the reach of the antitrust
laws and could extend to other industries.
   "The Court of Appeals has imposed on employees a choice
between the right to bargain collectively and the protection
of the antitrust laws," the attorneys general wrote.
   "We're not saying the players should win {the underlying
dispute} or management should win. But we believe the players
have a right to go forward and try to prove . . . that there
has been a restraint of trade," said Lloyd Constantine, chief
of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's
office.
   A spokesman for the NFL Management Council said he
couldn't comment on the filing because he hadn't seen it. The
council has argued that the Supreme Court shouldn't hear the
case because the ruling doesn't have a widespread effect, as
the players have claimed.
   Friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the players have
also been filed by the players' associations of the National
Hockey League and the National Basketball Association.
