   PARIS -- France's total output of goods and services is
likely to continue expanding at an annual rate of between 2%
and 3% in the first half of 1990 on a market basis, little
changed from the pace recorded in the second half of 1989,
the National Statistics Institute said.
   The French gross national product grew 4.1% on a market
basis and 3.7% overall in 1989. The former figure only takes
into account market activity, thereby excluding certain
government transactions.

   French government forecasters in the Economics Ministry
said last month that GNP in 1990 would rise 3.2%.
   Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to ease to an annual
rate of 3.1% by June, down from 3.4% in March, helped by
lower petroleum and food prices, as well as the stronger
franc, which lowered the cash cost of imports in the short
term.
