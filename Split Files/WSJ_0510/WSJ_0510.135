   Niagara Exchange Corp. said Riedman Corp. is seeking to
set aside its recent sale of convertible preferred to W.R.
Berkley Corp. for about $8.2 million, or to permanently
enjoin the voting rights of that preferred stock.
   Riedman, a Rochester, N.Y., insurance agency that
currently owns about 14% of Niagara's 1.8 million common
shares outstanding, launched a proxy vote to seek two of the
company's seven board seats. W.R. Berkley's 970,000 shares of
Niagara's convertible preferred represent a 35% stake.
Niagara, Buffalo, N.Y., and W.R. Berkley, Greenwich, Conn.,
are property-casualty insurance holding companies.

   Riedman, in a lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery,
is claiming that Niagara's sale of the preferred stock, which
is still subject to regulatory approval, has blocked its
proxy fight.
   Niagara said the allegations in the complaint are without
merit.
