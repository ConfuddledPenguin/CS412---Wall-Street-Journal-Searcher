   SAN FRANCISCO -- After another season of drought, a water
rationing plan was imposed on this thirsty city, requiring an
immediate 25% cut in consumption.
   San Francisco's move, affecting some 2.2 million water
customers in several surrounding counties, follows a similar
rationing plan adopted in March by the Santa Clara Valley
Water District.

   "This is a real emergency. We're in bad shape," said Rodel
Rodis, president of the city's public utilities commission,
after the vote to impose rationing late Tuesday. "We're in
the fourth year of a drought, and this is the worst year
yet."
   In a year of normal rainfall, he explained, the Hetch
Hetchy reservoir, which supplies much of the Bay Area's
drinking water, receives 700,000 acre feet of water. However,
during the past four rain-starved years, the reservoir has
received a cumulative total of just 525,000 acre feet of
water.
   Elements of the rationing plan will be familiar to city
residents from past seasons of scarcity. They include
shutting off decorative fountains, a ban on hosing sidewalks,
and restrictions against serving water in restaurants unless
a customer asks for it.
   Each household will receive a water allotment based upon
the number of people in it, with a sliding scale of penalties
for big and little offenders.
