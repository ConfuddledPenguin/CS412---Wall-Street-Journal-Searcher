   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. President Laurence A. Tisch chose to
look on the bright side of the ratings at the struggling TV
network during CBS's typically contentious annual
shareholders meeting.
   Responding to a stockholder's criticism that almost every
portion of the network's schedule -- including daytime, news,
prime-time and late night -- was in disarray, Mr. Tisch took
exception. "We're a total disaster only in prime time," the
chief executive officer said. "We will correct that."

   In the 1989-90 season, CBS finished in third place for the
third consecutive year. Last week, a CBS show tied for first
place, but it was a 40-year-old never-before-seen pilot of
the 1950's hit "I Love Lucy."
   The only other CBS show that consistently places in the
Top 10 is "60 Minutes," a 21-year-old broadcast produced by
the company's news division. In the just-completed TV season,
the highest-ranked CBS entertainment show was "Murder, She
Wrote," which placed No. 13 and has been on the air for six
years.
   "We all realize what's going on," Mr. Tisch said, "and
you're going to see progress starting in September. We're
making progress in prime time. Slower than we had hoped, but
we're getting there."
   A shareholder asked about reports that Walt Disney Co.
would purchase CBS. "I don't know of anybody who is going to
buy CBS," he said. "I think CBS is going to remain an
independent company."
   He also said that CBS wouldn't purchase other TV stations
"unless they make economic sense." CBS owns five stations
covering 20.8% of the country. Under regulations by the
Federal Communications Commission, a network can own stations
covering 25% of the country.
