   NEW YORK -- Takeover investing isn't dead, despite all the
new state anti-takeover laws and corporate takeover defenses
that were supposed to frustrate raiders.
   Raiders and hostile bidders are storming the barricades
via proxy fights to oust their targets' directors or force
other major changes.

   In four high-profile takeover battles this year -- for
Norton Co., Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., American General
Corp. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. -- the target
companies agreed to be acquired or auctioned following proxy
challenges by bidders.
   But as investors from Harold Simmons to Carl Icahn have
learned, a proxy fight alone isn't enough to gain decisive
shareholder support. Both men lost proxy challenges partly
because they weren't making an offer for the target company.
   The battering ram that is working is the one-two
combination of a takeover bid coupled with a proxy fight.
"The whole trend of bid-and-proxy fight is clearly on the
rise," says Robert Cotter, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at First Boston Corp., which has represented
contestants in six big proxy fights this year.
   Takeover activity is down 50% or more this year, leading
some traders to fear that one of the important props for the
entire stock market is being undermined. The prime culprit is
a dearth of available bank and junk-bond financing for
raiders and leveraged buy-out firms. On top of that, a
growing number of states are legislating tougher limits on
hostile takeovers.
   The reason proxy fights work against state laws and
corporate defenses is that most such measures are crafted to
stop hostile bids, meaning those opposed by the targets'
directors. If the directors get replaced by a shareholder
vote, the opposition ends.
   A proxy fight can even break through one anti-takeover
measure specifically designed to block it, the staggered
board, in which only one-third of the directors faces
re-election annually. It turns out that even a 33% minority
of directors, with backing from a shareholder majority, can
usually maneuver to gain control.
   John Wilcox, managing director of Georgeson &amp; Co., a proxy
solicitor, says that proxy fights are tapping a wellspring of
support from big institutional investors that dominate the
ownership of most large corporations. Those institutions have
come to depend on a steady diet of takeover bids to boost
stock market performance.
   Without corporate raiders financed by high-risk,
high-yield junk bonds, First Boston's Mr. Cotter points out,
"many chief executive officers have been breathing a sigh of
relief. And that has made institutional investors incredibly
nervous" about the lack of market discipline on floundering
companies.
   "Institutions are going to be a major force for change
down the line," says John Gavin, president of D.F. King &amp;
Co., another proxy solicitor.
   A proxy battle can trigger a sale even when the challenger
loses. American General, a Houston insurer, put itself up for
sale this past week despite having defeated Torchmark Corp.'s
attempt to oust the board. That puzzled some investors. One
explanation that wasn't disclosed at the time: a non-binding
proposal that American General be put up for sale received
roughly 50% of the shareholder votes.
   If a company's performance has been weak enough,
challengers can win proxy contests even without a bid. A
group led by Robert Gintel won such a contest against Xtra
Corp. on March 15. And two weeks later, Avon Products Inc.
gave another group of dissidents two board seats to avoid a
probable proxy-vote loss.
   But two well-known hostile bidders, Mr. Icahn and Mr.
Simmons, lost proxy fights when they failed to make bids.
Takeover experts say both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Simmons were also
handicapped by their past reputations as corporate raiders
who might not always act in the interests of other holders.
   Mr. Simmons, for example, won praise for his witty ads
mocking Lockheed management's record. However, he gained only
37% of the vote in his proxy fight, even though he controlled
19% of Lockheed's stock. By contrast, proxy measures to
weaken Lockheed's takeover defenses attracted far more
support, from 54% to 61% of all votes cast. Mr. Simmons was
also hindered by a Lockheed employee stock-ownership plan
that owns 19% of the aerospace company.
   Mr. Icahn limited his challenge against USX Corp. to a
non-binding referendum on whether the company should spin off
80% of its steel business, forgoing a bareknuckle attempt to
replace management. Both sides promised to avoid personal
attacks, saving Mr. Icahn from being tarred for his record as
a corporate raider and his past ties to the now-defunct
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Indeed, it isn't clear yet whether the proxy fight can
become an effective substitute for corporate raiders' tactics
during the heyday of junk bonds -- accumulating stock in a
target and making a low bid in hopes of either buying the
company cheaply or selling out at a profit to a higher
bidder.
   While the Belzberg family and Centaur Partners, both
investors with uneven track records as hostile bidders, are
making headway in current proxy fights, their efforts haven't
yet resulted in huge gains for their stock positions.
   Meanwhile, Ken Miller, president of the Lodestar Group, a
small mergers and acquisitions firm, says the
bid-and-proxy-fight strategy could result in a bunching-up of
takeover activity in the months just before the annual
meeting season each spring.
   Most companies hold annual meetings -- when shareholders
cast proxy votes to elect directors -- from March to June.
"I've sort of been wondering whether there's going to be a
falloff in bids after the proxy season is over," says Mr.
Miller. If so, takeover activity could slow even further in
months to come.
