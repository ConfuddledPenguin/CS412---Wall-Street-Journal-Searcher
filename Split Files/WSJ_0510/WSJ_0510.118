   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the ratings on about $1.7 billion of debt of Pennzoil Co.
because of uncertainty surrounding the company's investment
in Chevron Corp.
   That $2.1 billion investment represents about 45% of
Pennzoil's total assets. Moody's said concern remains over
how long Houston-based Pennzoil will retain its holdings in
San Francisco-based Chevron or whether it will attempt to
increase its stake, at the risk of further burdening an
already leveraged capital structure.

   Additionally, Pennzoil is experiencing weak operating
performance and may soon be hit with a tax bill that could
total close to $800 million. The tax issue stems from the
settlement of litigation with Texaco Inc. Downgraded by
Moody's were Pennzoil's debentures, notes, Euronotes and
preliminarily rated shelf registration, to single A-3, from
single A-2. Its commercial paper also was downgraded to
Prime-2, from Prime-1.
