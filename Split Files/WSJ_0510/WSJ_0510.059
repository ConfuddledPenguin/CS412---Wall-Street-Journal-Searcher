   Radio Tags Trigger
   Train Identification

   RAILROAD executives think they've found a reliable way to
track freight cars.
   Currently, clerks at freight yards manually type car
identification numbers into computer consoles, producing an
error rate of between 1% and 3%. One result: Freight cars too
often wind up on the wrong train to the wrong destination,
delaying deliveries and angering shippers.
   So railroads are testing automated ID systems that use
radio-triggered devices, known as transponders, mounted on
the sides of freight cars. When a transponder is excited by a
low-frequency radio signal broadcast from a trackside
transmitter, it responds by sending out identifying
information. "It's like Morse code with a flashlight and a
mirror," says R. Rand Brown, a vice president of Amtech Inc.,
a Dallas company that sells the equipment.
   Steven Ditmeyer, who heads the research group of
Burlington Northern Inc.'s rail unit, says the technology
proved 99.99% accurate during tests in Minnesota. Both
Burlington and Norfolk Southern Corp. are putting radio tags
on their locomotives, but neither have decided whether to put
them on all their freight cars.
   Rail executives say it's just a matter of time before the
technology is adopted for all of the nation's 1.2 million
freight cars. In April, the Association of American Railroads
smoothed the way by deciding that each car should be equipped
with transponders on two sides, rather than just one, to help
identify cars on parallel tracks. Companies had been waiting
for a standard to be set.
   Some rail executives are still smarting from the
industry's previous attempt to monitor freight cars
automatically using bar-code technology, like that found in
supermarkets. Dirt and snow on the bar code panels caused
misreading rates to climb to 30%, and the rail industry
scrapped the system in 1978. "Everyone is still skittish,"
Mr. Ditmeyer says.
                                                                                                       

   Train Toilets May Take
   A Cue From Airlines
                                                                                                       

   AMTRAK HAS TURNED to makers of airplane toilet systems to
meet impending restrictions on dumping waste from its trains.
   The passenger railroad has been fighting lawsuits brought
by Florida and other states tired of having sewage released
on the tracks. Charles Engelhardt, Amtrak's director of
equipment design, says the company is testing six systems
made by four companies. Amtrak is searching for a system that
would retain wastes for up to 72 hours. That way,
long-distance trains wouldn't need servicing en route.
   Monogram Sanitation of Compton, Calif., a maker of
airplane waste systems, proposes to retrofit long-distance
Amtrak cars with 250-gallon retention tanks while reducing
the amount of water used in each toilet flush to seven
ounces, about one-seventh the normal amount. Monogram would
redesign the toilet bowls, using steeper sides and a Teflon
coating, so that they would perform with less water.
   Once a model is found, Amtrak says it may be cheaper to
replace some aging sleeping cars than to equip them with new
toilet systems.
                                                                                                       

   Looking to Get Around
   Double-Hull Oil Tankers
                                                                                                       

   AS CONGRESS considers legislation to mandate double hulls
on oil tankers to prevent spills, the ship industry is
proposing easier and less-costly alternatives.
   The Swedish Maritime Administration is promoting a
"vacuum" method to reduce pollution in the event of a damaged
hull. The scheme involves setting cargo tank pressure valves
so that air can't enter the tanks. The initial escape of a
small amount of oil after a tanker grounding would then
create a vacuum in the space between the oil cargo and the
top of the tank that would keep the vast majority of the
cargo from flowing out.
   Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., a New York ship company,
advocates loading oil, which is lighter than water, slightly
higher than the water line. The company suggests filling the
cargo tanks 15% less than normal and keeping the ballast
tanks filled with water on all voyages so the vessel rides
lower in the ocean. That way, very little oil would come out
after a grounding as long as the fluid in the tanks remains
in hydrostatic balance with the water outside, says George
Blake, a director of Overseas Shipholding.
   Critics say Mr. Blake's proposal provides limited
protection in cases where tankers are punctured on the side
or are exposed to strong waves. They also are concerned that
the Swedish vacuum method would subject cargo tanks to
potential collapse and interfere with the vessel's inert gas
system, intended to counter explosive cargo fumes.
   The alternative plans "have some value," says Arthur
McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center, an
information clearinghouse. "But by no stretch of the
imagination are they a substitute for double hulls or double
bottoms."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   LONG VEHICLES can take tight corners more easily with a
truck trailer rear axle steering system, says Steerable
Carriages, a company in Little York, N.J. Henry J. Kmiecik,
vice president, likens the system to the tiller man at the
rear of a hook and ladder truck. . . . Michael Baker Corp., a
Beaver, Pa., engineering consulting firm, says it is testing
a system to continuously monitor the structural integrity of
highway bridges by measuring their response to traffic loads.
The system uses gauges permanently mounted on the bridges to
measure strain.
