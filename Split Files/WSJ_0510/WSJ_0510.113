   Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC said pretax profit for the
fiscal year ended Jan. 31, edged up a meager 4.2% amid
difficult trading conditions in Latin America and a lack of
substantial price increases in its core businesses.
   Pretax profit at the Dublin, Ireland, paper and packaging
concern rose to 246 million punts ($398.3 million) from 236
million punts in the year-ago period, while sales increased
21% to 1.66 billion punts from 1.37 billion punts.

   A soft paper industry in the U.S. helped trim profit
growth for the company's biggest-earning region, said
Smurfit's secretary, Michael Pettigrew. In Latin America,
pretax profit dipped 1.8% to 58.6 million punts from 59.7
million punts a year ago. Pressures on certain Latin American
economies, particularly Venezuela's, curbed profit growth,
Mr. Pettigrew said.
