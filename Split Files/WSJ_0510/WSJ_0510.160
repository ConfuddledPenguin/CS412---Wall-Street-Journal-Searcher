   NEW YORK -- Is money manager John Templeton, one of the
patriarchs of fundamental stock picking, turning in his sharp
pencil for a computer?
   Mr. Templeton's money management firm has quietly acquired
Dais Group Inc., a high-tech stock trading and research
operation orphaned by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc. Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd. paid about
$1 million for Dais, a number-crunching outfit that in its
Drexel days traded big baskets of stock using computer
models. That might seem to be a far cry from Mr. Templeton's
own roam-the-globe strategy of digging up neglected companies
trading below their real worth.

   Mr. Templeton insists he isn't changing his stripes.
"Buying bargains hasn't become obsolete," he said from
London, where he is administering his $680,000 Templeton
Prize for Progress in Religion.
   He is betting that other money managers, in particular
giant pension funds, are going to rely more and more on
computer-aided "quantitative" research, especially when it
comes to global investing.
   Mr. Templeton, of course, is in a prime position to watch
for trends in the money management business. His firm manages
13 mutual funds with combined assets exceeding $9 billion,
including nine broker-sold funds and four of the publicly
traded "closed end" type funds in the U.S.
   He is going to keep Dais Group at arm's length. "It will
operate under its own name, in its own office with its own
people," he said, and such independent status is a first for
a Templeton subsidiary. Mr. Templeton may not want the
"quants" to get too close to his stock pickers, though he
concedes that his staff already uses some of the Dais Group's
research.
   Martin Flanagan, Templeton's chief financial officer, said
the firm views Dais "like an undervalued security that would
be good to have in our portfolio. That isn't to say that all
of a sudden we are going to take on quantitative research in
the management of the Templeton funds."
   Mr. Templeton manages more than $15 billion in stock for
thousands of investors. A pioneer international investor, he
is famed for finding hidden values in stock markets around
the world.
   But among the holdings, there are other signs that Mr.
Templeton is quietly betting on the business of high-tech
stock trading and research. Among the holdings of the
Templeton funds is 695,000 shares, or about 10%, of Jefferies
Group Inc., the aggressive third-market trading firm that is
making a major investment in high-tech trading systems.
   Templeton funds are also large holders of other
financial-services concerns. They own 1.3 million shares of
Dreyfus Corp., the mutual fund company; about 500,000 shares
of Salomon Inc., parent of Salomon Brothers, and his funds
are among the largest stockholders of money manager American
Capital Management &amp; Research Inc.
   As the money-management business consolidates into bigger
and bigger pools of capital, computers have given portfolio
managers a variety of tools -- from the ability to rapidly
buy and sell big baskets of stocks to sophisticated systems
that compare the day-by-day performance of thousands of
stocks in dozens of markets.
   But there is another reason why Templeton thinks
quantitative investing will become more popular: it's
cheaper. Money managers are trying to cut costs and beat
market averages, and quantitative techniques have in recent
years accomplished both tasks.
   "Many of the traditional, fundamental investors are coming
up for retirement, and the new guard taking over is being
trained" with quantitative techniques, said Nicholas Lopardo,
chief investment officer at State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
which manages about $50 billion solely with quantitative
strategies.
   Last February, when Drexel's parent filed for
bankruptcy-law protection, Dais Group was quickly bought by
its two top executives, George Douglas and Robert Butman.
   Messrs. Douglas and Butman held daily huddles with the
staff to keep up morale, and have sought to fend off
competitors who tried to lure away some of their 125
institutional clients. The Templeton purchase, they say, will
give Dais access to foreign stock-market data and the capital
the firm needs to expand.
   Mr. Templeton launched his first mutual fund, Templeton
Growth, in 1954. But his really spectacular performance
didn't come until the 1970s, when he managed to sidestep the
1973-74 U.S. bear market while making a large and hugely
successful bet on Japanese stocks.
   According to Lipper Analytical Services, Templeton Growth
soared 18.8% a year during the 1970s, versus 5.9% for the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   By the start of the 1980s, Mr. Templeton was managing two
funds, Templeton Growth and Templeton World, with combined
assets of just over $300 million. As money flowed in, Mr.
Templeton has continued to produce handsome, though not
spectacular, results. Through the 1980s, Templeton Growth
returned 16.4% a year, and Templeton World 17.6%, versus
17.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and 18.1% for the average global stock
fund.
   Born in Tennessee, Mr. Templeton became a British national
and was knighted in 1987. He now lives in the Bahamas, at the
exclusive Lyford Cay Club. He sponsors a big cash prize for
significant contributions to religious thought and life. Past
recipients include Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Alexander
Solzhenitsyn.
