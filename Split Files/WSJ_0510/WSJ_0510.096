   LONDON -- Britain's retail price index for April is
expected to have risen 3.3% from March and 9.7% from a year
ago, according to a survey of 10 economists.
   That would compare with March's monthly rise of 1% and
March's year-on-year rise of 8.1%.

   The official April figures are scheduled to be released
Friday.
   If the economists' projections are accurate, Britain's
inflation rate in April reached its highest year-on-year
level since March 1982, when it touched 10.4%, according to
Yamaichi International (Europe) Ltd.
