   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it assigned its
SP-1 rating to New York City's $900 million of general
obligation revenue anticipation notes -- or RANs -- fiscal
1990, Series C and D. S&amp;P also affirmed its SP-1 rating on
$1.25 billion of outstanding RANs due June 29.
   S&amp;P said the city is being forced to do additional fiscal
1990 cash flow borrowing because of New York state's delay in
adopting its 1991 budget. S&amp;P also said the city's long-range
credit outlook remains negative because of a looming $1
billion budget gap. "There are enough risks and uncertainties
. . . that balanced financial results are by no means
assured," S&amp;P said.

   Also, Moody's Investors Service Inc. assigned its MIG-2
rating to today's RAN issue. Moody's also lowered to MIG-2
from MIG-1 the ratings on the fiscal 1990 series A and B
notes also due June 29.
   Moody's also cited uncertainties surrounding the
resolution of the state budget process or the city's
statutory ability to renew its notes if the state monies
aren't received on time.
   Last night New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins blasted
the Moody's decision, calling it "premature and unnecessary."
Speaking at a dinner of the Municipal Forum of New York, Mr.
Dinkins said he understands the rationale for the decision
but strongly disagrees with it and hopes to persuade Moody's
to change its decision.
