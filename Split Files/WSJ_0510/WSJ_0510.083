   JOHANNESBERG -- Shortly after his release from prison,
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela appealed to
the warring black factions in this country to throw their
guns and knives into the sea. Up to 5,000 blacks have died at
the hands of other blacks since late 1984. The eastern
province of Natal has been the scene of the worst and most
bloodthirsty clashes, claiming the lives of more than 2,500
people over the past five years and rendering between 50,000
and 70,000 people homeless.
   But Mr. Mandela's plea has gone unheeded, and the violence
is getting worse. Since the beginning of this year, more than
600 people have been killed in Natal and more than 2,000 have
been injured. In the first two weeks of March alone, there
were 730 recorded instances of serious violence. The killings
have been brutal. Eighteen people have been "necklaced" --
burned to death by a gasoline-soaked tire round the neck --
this year. One of them was a nine-year-old-girl, another a
14-year-old boy.

   An 80-year-old woman was abducted and brutally stabbed to
death south of Durban. A 75-year-old black town councillor in
Newcastle, Natal, shot himself in the head to avoid capture
and a necklace death at the hands of a mob of youths. Tiny
babies have been burnt to death in fire-bombed houses, or
abandoned by parents fleeing for their lives.
   The strife is often described as inter-tribal violence
between the Zulus -- the largest of South Africa's 12 black
ethnic groups and formerly the rulers of large stretches of
present-day South Africa -- and the Xhosas, the second
largest group. This impression is sometimes sustained by the
chauvinist remarks of some traditional Zulu spokesmen.
Zwelethini Goodwill, hereditary king of the Zulus called on
his people in a March speech to honor their culture "with
your Zulu might."
   In that same speech, he railed against Zulu youth who join
trade unions and disobey their elders, and called upon Zulu
traditionalists to "act swiftly and decisively." This speech
was given in the middle of bloody fighting in Natal and was
taken as a "call to blood."
   When black troops from outside a region are deployed,
local people will often express fears that the troops are
Zulus. When black conservatives mobilize as "vigilantes" to
oppose radical activists in their townships they are widely
thought of as associated with the Zulus. Radical activists in
turn single out Zulus for punishment. Black youths on the
Witwatersrand have attacked motor vehicles with Natal
registration plates in a search of Zulus.
   In fact, though, the conflict among black South Africans
is not a tribal struggle, but an ideological one. Large
numbers of Zulus belong to the ANC and its affiliates, the
United Democratic Front and the Confederation of South
African Trade Unions. While the membership of Inkatha, the
religiously and politically conservative group that is the
ANC's chief rival for power in black South Africa, is
overwhelmingly Zulu, Inkatha's leader, Mangosutho Buthelezi,
has very seldom appealed to sectional tribal loyalties.
   Years ago Mr. Buthelezi incurred the wrath of the South
African government by issuing citizenship in the "independent
homeland" state KwaZulu, of which he is chief minister, to
Xhosas and other non-Zulus in order to help them to evade
"influx control" laws and move to the rapidly developing
industrial areas of Natal. Inkatha has always been open to
blacks of all tribes and has for years published its
materials not only in Zulu but in Sotho, English and
Afrikaans as well.
   Although Mr. Buthelezi is connected to the Zulu royal
family, his differences with the ANC are not ethnically
motivated. A devout traditional Anglican who considers
liberation theology a threat to the integrity of the Gospel,
Mr. Buthelezi understands the benefits of federalism and
devolution and mistrusts central state hegemony. His concern
with growth and employment has led him to oppose emphatically
the ANC's campaign for sanctions against South Africa. So,
while he has always acknowledged the importance of the ANC,
he cannot find a home in a movement that leans toward
socialism and is allied to the South African Communist Party.
   Mr. Buthelezi's views are shared by Zulu traditionalists,
many of them businessmen and conservative Christians. They
are fiercely rejected by unionized black workers, younger
urban activists and left-leaning ministers and priests. Zulus
are found on both sides of this intellectual divide -- a
divide that is the origin of the Inkatha-ANC struggle in
South Africa, and especially in Natal.
   Since 1985, the exiled ANC has sought to assert control
over all the anti-apartheid forces in South Africa. At the
end of 1989, the Mass Democratic Movement (an ANC front)
approved a motion at its "Conference for a Democratic Future"
to bring pressure to bear on "homeland" leaders to resign or
declare their loyalty to the ANC, and to bring similar
pressures to bear on local black town councilors.
   Political resistance to this bid for ANC dominance has
been greatest in Natal, where Inkatha is strongest. Inkatha,
in its turn, is accused by the ANC of having provoked the
violence by an aggressive membership campaign also aimed at
establishing political control in Natal.
   But while ideology explains the conflict between blacks in
South Africa, it does not explain why it is so bitter. After
all, the ANC has been able to establish political
understandings with five other "homeland" leaders, most
notably with Enos Mabusa, the chief minister of KaNgwane. One
must add a few additional ingredients to the analysis.
   As in many Third World societies in which democratic
pluralism has not yet taken root, politics in black South
Africa is about establishing local hegemony or control of
political territory. Add the fact that upward of 70% of black
township youth are unemployed, bored and tempted by the
excitement of political struggle, and it's no surprise that a
culture of violence is taking hold.
   A black doctor in Durban, Natal, was recently attacked by
UDF-linked youths who accused him of treating Inkatha
patients when he should treat only ANC sympathisers. In some
schools in metropolitan areas in Natal, Inkatha pupils are
made to feel at least unwelcome, if they are not actually
barred; in other schools in other areas UDF youth are put
under similar pressures. Violence erupted in Durban in March,
when a Confederation of South African Trade Unions-linked bus
strike prevented Inkatha supporters from attending a rally in
Durban at which the Zulu king spoke.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha are consequently ambivalent about
the violence in Natal. They want to establish or defend their
political control of black society in Natal. On the other
hand, the sheer brutality of conflict -- and the intense
personal vendettas that have emerged in the townships --
embarrasses them. UDF-ANC leaders complain of "criminal
elements" infiltrating their struggle and Inkatha feels
uneasy about local conservative "big men," called warlords,
who mount offensives on personal initiatives for which Mr.
Buthelezi is blamed.
   Peace talks between Mr. Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi were
planned for late March or early April, but Mr. Mandela broke
them off because, as he said on April 23, his movement ad
vised him against contact with Mr. Buthelezi so long as the
violence was raging. Mr. Buthelezi, in turn, is equally hesi
tant about talking in situations that will create the impres
sion he is conceding political primacy to the ANC.
   In the meantime, angry youths continue to fuel the flames.
"Mobilize, organize for the final offensive] All youth to
battle] All youth to the frontline]" This was the way in
which a recent conference of the UDF-linked South African
Youth Congress was reported by the ANC sympathizing newspaper
New Nation. At the moment, Inkatha appears to be more
powerful, or lethal, on the ground. The bulk of the refugees
in Natal come from communities sympathetic to the ANC.
   No doubt the ANC-linked youth will remobilize to reverse
the situation. An ANC leader in Natal, Harry Gwala, on May 1
issued a call: "Let us wipe them out if they attack us,"
reinforcing threats of massive retaliation against Inkatha
made on the same day by the Confederation of South African
Trade Unions.
   A prominent black journalist, Connie Molusi, said in a
recent discussion organized by the South African Institute of
Race Relations, that his knowledge of black South African
opposition politics convinced him that there was "no group
with a concept of political pluralism" -- with an effective
and not merely rhetorical commitment to the unpleasant
democratic duty of accepting the political opponents have a
right to mobilize and be heard.
   In the past, before President F.W. de Klerk's leadership,
the South African government hugely contributed to this
lethal tradition in South African politics by its repression
of resistance movements. Unless a mood of at least reluctant
tolerance of political opponents can take root in South
African society, current negotiations may yield power sharing
between whites and some black power-groupings, but they will
not bring democracy in the sense that the West understands
it. Until all political groupings come to understand the view
that democratic politics is about representation and not
about control, the killing will continue.
