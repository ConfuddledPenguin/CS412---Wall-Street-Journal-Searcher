   NEW YORK -- The dollar declined sharply against major
currencies yesterday amid fears that current efforts to
reduce the federal budget deficit might result in downward
pressure on U.S. interest rates.
   The U.S. unit fell two pfennigs to a 28-month low against
the mark and dropped more than a yen as a budget "summit" was
scheduled for Tuesday between President Bush and Congress.

   Some participants said the dollar's sharp decline was
precipitated by an article yesterday in The Wall Street
Journal suggesting that Mr. Bush sees an accord on narrowing
the deficit as the only way to ensure lower interest rates
over the long term.
   The administration is known to favor lower interest rates
as a means of stimulating the economy and spurring
improvement in the country's trade imbalance with Japan,
which recent dollar strength against the yen is seen
impeding.
   During the afternoon, the White House released a statement
saying it hoped an agreement on the budget deficit would lead
the Federal Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates. "We would
hope that the Fed would be impressed" with the latest effort
to cut the deficit, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The budget talks were scheduled amid some disappointment
in the market at the 8.74% average yield that the Treasury's
$10.5 billion of three-year notes brought Tuesday, said David
Ogg, chief dealer at Credit Suisse in New York. The market
had been hoping for a slightly higher yield to serve as a
sign that pressure for lower U.S. interest rates isn't
growing, Mr. Ogg said.
   News that the Treasury's $10 billion of 10-year notes
brought an average yield of 8.88% yesterday came too late in
the day to influence currency trading.
   Traders said earlier yesterday that they would be watching
the 10-year note auction later in the day and the 30-year
bond sale today in order to gauge foreign investors'
confidence in the U.S.
   Japanese participation in both Tuesday's and yesterday's
note auctions ran at about the customary 30% level, according
to preliminary information. Traders said they are most
interested in Japanese purchases of 10-year and 30-year
paper, reasoning that good buying by Japanese of the
longer-term issues signals stronger willingness to invest in
U.S. paper.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6360 marks, down from 1.6573 marks late Tuesday, and at
156.50 yen, down from 157.62 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6785, up from $1.6705 Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 156.55 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
157.03 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6355
marks.
   Overall, the market remains bearish on the dollar in the
short term, with participants choosing to view developments
with an eye toward selling the U.S. unit, said Robert White,
a vice president and manager of corporate trading at First
Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles.
   Mr. White cited as evidence the market's reaction to the
budget-deficit talks. Traders focused on the possibility of
lower interest rates that the discussions might produce
instead of on prospects for a reduction in the deficit, which
could be seen as bullish for the dollar, Mr. White said.
   The U.S. unit's fall against the mark was exacerbated by
growing demand for the West German unit based on an improving
market assessment of the West German central bank's ability
to control inflation associated with German reunification,
said Andy Robertson, foreign exchange sales manager at Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York.
   The mark also recorded gains against the yen in active
non-dollar dealings yesterday, rising to 95.63 yen in late
New York trading from 95.10 yen in New York Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.90 to $371.90 an ounce in moderate trading.
Estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $371 an ounce.
