   The Soviet Union has talked with Salomon Inc. and possibly
other big U.S. securities firms about setting up a $1 billion
to $2 billion fund for investing in that country.
   Andrew Jonas, head of East European investment banking at
Salomon Brothers International Ltd. in London, confirmed that
Salomon has had discussions with Soviet banking officials
that began at the Soviets' initiative. However, he said the
discussions are "at somewhat of a dead end because of
political problems there."

   Mr. Jonas's remarks were made in response to a question at
a conference on Eastern European investment opportunities
sponsored by the Corporate Finance Institute in New York.
   He said a possible fund might center on financing for
three or four large projects. "I mean big projects, because
the Soviets only think in terms of big projects," Mr. Jonas
said, but he gave no specifics.
   The fund, if realized, the Salomon executive said, would
start out much more modestly than the Soviets might have had
in mind, probably at $20 million.
   Even if the Soviets overcome their political problems,
there is no guarantee that Wall Street will work with them.
Other investment banks aside from Salomon are said to have
been approached by the Soviets. But, said Mr. Jonas, Salomon
is worried about how marketable a fund would be.
