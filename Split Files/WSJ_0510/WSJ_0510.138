   DALLAS -- National Realty L.P. said it settled a
class-action lawsuit brought by unitholders who claimed they
were bilked when the real estate master limited partnership
was formed in 1987 out of 35 pre-existing limited
partnerships.
   National Realty was created by a controversial rollup of
partnerships operated by troubled Southmark Corp., some of
which were devastated by the real estate bust in the
Southwest.

   While National Realty didn't admit any liability in making
the settlement, terms of the agreement call for the company
to issue to plaintiffs five-year warrants to purchase 2.75
million partnership units at $11 a unit for the first year
and $12 thereafter. Also, certain co-defendants agreed to
contribute to the partnership cash and notes totaling $5.5
million.
   National Realty's general partners agreed to contribute
$2.5 million over four years, with the remainder coming from
the former E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. (now Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.), the broker-dealer in the rollup, and Robert A. McNeil,
the former general partner of the partnerships involved in
the litigation.
   A spokeswoman for National Realty said that other
defendants, primarily Southmark-related entities, haven't
reached a settlement with plaintiffs yet.
   The settlement also raises the possibility that National
Realty's general partners could be removed if the value of
the partnership's units doesn't reach agreed-upon targets for
the next five years. After one year, the agreement
stipulates, National Realty units must be worth at least $11;
at the end of five years, the target is $30. Achievement of
the targets can be made both by increases in the share price
of units and by distributions to limited partners.
   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
National Realty closed yesterday at $4.875, up 25 cents.
   If the target in any year isn't met, an oversight
committee formed by limited partners can require National
Realty to sell a percentage of its assets.
   The settlement still must be ratified by a state court in
San Mateo, Calif.
