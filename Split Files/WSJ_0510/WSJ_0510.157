   Entertainment Weekly, the new magazine put out by New
York-based Time Warner Inc.'s Time Inc. Magazine Co., said it
has bought the name and subscription file of 7 Days, which
was folded last month. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Michael Klingensmith, publisher of Entertainment Weekly,
said that 7 Days' 20,000 paid subscribers would be offered
issues of Entertainment Weekly to fulfill the rest of their
subscriptions. Mr. Klingensmith said that those readers would
roughly double Entertainment Weekly's circulation in New York
City, and that the 7 Days audience "has extremely attractive
demographics to advertisers."

   The 7 Days name may be used for a special regional edition
or supplement to Entertainment Weekly, which would provide
specific entertainment listings for New York, said Mr.
Klingensmith. "It's all speculative at this point," he said,
"But we feel the name has very good equity, particularly in
this market." Just 10 days after 7 Days' owner Leonard Stern
suspended publication, the magazine won a National Magazine
Award for General Excellence among small circulation
magazines.
