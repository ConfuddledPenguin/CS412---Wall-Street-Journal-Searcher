   CINCINNATI -- Kroger Co. said it reached a tentative
agreement on a new three-year labor contract for 8,500 clerks
and meat cutters in the company's King Soopers division in
Denver. Employees are voting on the contract.
   The supermarket chain said 6,000 retail clerks and meat
cutters in Dallas-Fort Worth completed ratification of a new
three-year contract last week.
