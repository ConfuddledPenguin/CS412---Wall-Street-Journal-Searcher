   NEW YORK -- Creditors of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s commodities trading unit filed an involuntary
bankruptcy petition against the subsidiary.
   The creditors, including the central banks of Portugal and
Yugoslavia, as well as Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading
company, made the filing under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. A Drexel spokesman said it won't challenge
the filing but will seek to have it converted to a Chapter 11
case, under which the debtor remains in control of the
company. The motion was filed in U.S. bankruptcy court in
Manhattan.

   DBL Trading, of Fort Lee, N.J., is no longer doing
business and has been "winding down" its positions since Feb.
13, when the parent filed under Chapter 11. A Drexel
spokesman said the trading unit has a net liability of $505
million; its chief asset is a $558 million claim owed to the
unit by the parent company. The parent borrowed $600 million
from the unit before it filed under Chapter 11.
   Barry Dichter, a bankruptcy partner with Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft, which represents the central bank of
Portugal, said DBL Trading has about 100 other creditors. The
central bank of Portugal is owed $120 million, he said. The
central banks leased a small portion of their gold reserves
to the unit, which paid the foreign countries interest on the
gold while investing it in other transactions. The largest
creditor is Nissho Iwai, which is owed $500 million.
   Mr. Dichter said the unit had paid about 10% of the amount
that is owed.

   NISSHO IWAI Corp. is owed about $160 million by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading
Corp. unit. Thursday's edition misstated the amount.
