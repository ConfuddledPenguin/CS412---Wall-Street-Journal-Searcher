   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Ethics Committee has expanded its
case against Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.) and will
examine a new charge that he violated government ethics laws
regarding blind trusts.
   The committee also announced yesterday that it had found
"substantial credible evidence" that Sen. Durenberger may
have "abused" his Senate office by improperly receiving
reimbursement for staying in a condominium he partly owned;
submitting improper reimbursement vouchers for travel;
misrepresenting the ownership of the condominium, and
back-dating real estate transactions.

   Although the allegation that Sen. Durenberger may have
violated the Ethics in Government Act's provisions relating
to communication about his blind trust is new, the
committee's expansion of the investigation to include the
condominium arrangement was expected.
   "This is the logical next step," said Sen. Durenberger's
administrative assistant, Bert McKasy. According to Sen.
Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West, the blind-trust
issue involves the senator's communication with his attorney,
who was also administrator of the trust, concerning the
condominium.
   Last January, Sen. Durenberger repaid the Senate $11,005
after the Rules Committee decided he shouldn't have been
reimbursed for use of the condominium during congressional
recesses.
   The ethics panel had announced earlier this month that it
would hold trial-like hearings beginning June 12 to determine
whether Sen. Durenberger had broken Senate rules and federal
law in a $100,000 book deal he had with Piranha Press. The
expanded charges announced yesterday will be combined with
the charges relating to the book deal.
   Ethics committee members will act as a jury to hear
evidence and determine whether Sen. Durenberger, who has
served in the Senate for 12 years, should be punished. If any
of the allegations are proven, possible punishment ranges
from reprimand to expulsion.
