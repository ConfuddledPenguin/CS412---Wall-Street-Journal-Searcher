   WASHINGTON -- The Record Industry Association of America
unveiled a uniform voluntary label -- which will appear on
certain records, cassettes and compact disks -- warning
customers of explicit lyrics.
   Beginning in July, the black-and-white sticker will
appear, at the discretion of record companies, on the lower
right-hand corner of the product, inside the cellophane. It
will read: "Parental Advisory -- Explicit Lyrics."

   The plan is endorsed by the six record distributors that
dominate the business: Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Records, MCA
Inc.'s MCA Records, Sony Corp.'s CBS Records, Bertelsmann
AG's BMG unit, N.V. Philips's PolyGram Records and Thorn EMI
PLC's Capitol-EMI Records. It is also endorsed by the
National Association of Recording Merchandisers, which
represents retailers.
   This uniform label replaces a 1985 plan under which
individual record companies devised their own labels. The new
system is designed to blunt criticism of the record industry
by citizen's groups and state legislators.
