   There are times that I have
   A germ of a thought
   On a phrase or a rhyme --

   I may spend many hours
   In inspired reflection,
   In the end to decide
   The germ needs disinfection.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.

   To married children moving home
   I find myself opposed.
   I think I'll post a sign that says,
   "Sorry, Nest Is Closed."
