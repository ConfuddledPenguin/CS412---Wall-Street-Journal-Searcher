   KENT, Wash. -- Flow International Corp. said it retained
the firm of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. as its investment banker
to explore alternatives to "maximize shareholder value."
   Y.H. Pao, chairman of Flow, said the producer of
high-pressure water jets may be a candidate for merger or
acquisition, or other actions to improve value to the
shareholders.
