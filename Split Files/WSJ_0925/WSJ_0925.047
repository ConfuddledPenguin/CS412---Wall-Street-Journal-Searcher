   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. declared a special cash dividend of
$2.50 a share as an enticement to shareholders, who will soon
be voting on the company's merger with London-based Willis
Faber PLC.
   Because Corroon will be filing supplemental proxy
materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
New York-based insurance broker postponed the special
shareholders meeting for voting on the Willis Faber merger
from Friday until Oct. 4. The new proxy material, due to be
mailed to holders tomorrow, will provide details on the
special dividend and other recent events, including Aon
Corp.'s unsolicited $40-a-share, or $840 million, bid for
Corroon.

   The insurance broker rejected Aon's offer last Tuesday.
Chicago-based Aon withdrew its bid last Friday.
   Robert Cuthbert, Corroon's chief financial officer, said
the special dividend was needed "to facilitate the
transaction." The special dividend would "focus everyone's
attention on the deal" as originally structured, he added.
   When the Willis Faber merger was announced in early June,
it was valued at $34.72 a share, or $712.3 million. Since
then, Willis Faber's share price has dropped, lowering the
deal's total value.
   Corroon's stock jumped several points when the Aon offer
was announced, but it fell back when it appeared that the
Corroon board still favored the Willis Faber merger and Aon
wouldn't pursue a hostile offer. Corroon shares rose 25 cents
to a $29.50 closing in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday.
   The Corroon board declared the special dividend at a board
meeting held Sunday. The special dividend is payable to
Corroon's holders of record on the effective date of the
proposed merger with Willis Faber. The special dividend won't
be paid unless the merger is completed. The special dividend
was also approved by the Willis Faber board.
   Willis Faber shareholders will be voting Friday on the
merger with Corroon.
