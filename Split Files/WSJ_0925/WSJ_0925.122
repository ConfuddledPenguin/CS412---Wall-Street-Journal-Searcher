   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Transportation Department, as
expected, approved passenger fare increases of 5% to 10% on
overseas flights, starting Oct. 1. Most international fares
would increase 7%.
   The department yesterday said it was sanctioning the
increases because the airline industry is facing rising jet
fuel prices, prompted by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   A government official said the increases aren't unlawful
or injurious to competition.
   Unlike on domestic routes, carriers must get government
approval before they can raise or lower international fares,
which are regulated mostly by bilateral agreements. The
increases are awaiting government approval from other
countries.
   Carriers are turning to fare increases as a way of
generating extra revenue at a time when the higher cost of
fuel is prompting layoffs, fleet reductions and lower
earnings forecasts.
   The department approved a 7% fare increase on most
international fares. On flights within Europe, ticket prices
will rise 5%. It sanctioned a 6% boost on fares to Ireland
and the United Kingdom and an 8% increase on flights from
Canada. One of the increases allowed is a 10% rise on flights
from Greece.
   The increases will last for six months to cover fuel
costs. The department can allow extensions or other fare
increases after these have expired.
   A war risk surcharge was also approved for flights mostly
in the Middle East. The carriers may determine the terms of
the surcharges. In addition, cargo rates will be increased 6%
to 10% starting Oct. 1.
