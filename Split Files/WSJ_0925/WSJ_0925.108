   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee's chairman
plans to introduce today a sweeping deposit-insurance
overhaul bill that would force regulators to restrict risky
operations of weak banks and thrifts before they fail and
pile up big losses that could be handed to taxpayers.
   The proposal from Sen. Donald Riegle would also radically
change the handling of bank bailouts by forbidding federal
regulators to take any action to protect deposits above the
$100,000 insurance limit. Under the "too big to fail" policy,
regulators in recent years have routinely sold failed banks
and thrifts to other institutions in deals that protected all
deposits, even those exceeding $100,000. Many experts say
taming that policy is a key to limiting the government's
deposit-insurance costs in the wake of the savings-and-loan
debacle, expected to cost $150 billion excluding interest.

   Sen. Riegle's plan is the most detailed deposit-insurance
revision proposal from a congressional leader, and also
indicates that Capitol Hill, stung by political fallout from
the S&amp;L mess, is growing determined to take major action on
the issue next year. The Treasury Department is expected to
propose broad deposit-insurance changes early next year.
   The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which is similar in some
respects to recommendations made by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan and the General Accounting Office,
doesn't lower the $100,000 insurance limit or try to limit
the number of insured accounts an individual can have. Though
some important lawmakers, such as House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), have suggested such
changes, a consensus seems to be emerging that requiring
certain stringent actions against troubled financial
institutions can protect the government without spooking
depositors too much.
   However, depositors would be limited to $100,000 of
insurance coverage per bank or thrift under Mr. Riegle's
bill. Currently, depositors can hold multiple insured
accounts in a single institution through joint accounts and
accounts held in trust for children. But Mr. Riegle would
still allow depositors to have as many insured accounts as
they wished at different institutions.
   Under Sen. Riegle's proposal, a bank or thrift would be
subject to restrictions once it fell below required capital
levels. The institution wouldn't be allowed to pay dividends
-- as many undercapitalized institutions do now -- and would
have to restrict its growth severely. The bank or thrift
would also have to submit an acceptable plan to raise
capital. (Capital is the owners' investment in the
institution, which is drained off before federal deposit
insurance funds are called in.)
   If the institution's capital continued shrinking,
regulators would have to enforce other restrictions on its
activities, and would soon thereafter have to take control of
the institution or document why they didn't take control. The
aim of the plan is to make sure that when institutions do
fail, their losses are minimal.
   The proposal also calls for raising the required level of
capital. Mr. Riegle doesn't specify a higher level, but
rather calls on the regulators to set a new level that would
prevent losses to the deposit-insurance funds for banks and
thrifts. As a further incentive for banks to maintain high
capital, the proposal would also allow the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. to charge higher insurance premiums to banks
with low capital.
   In addition, the plan would require the FDIC to license
and regulate deposit brokers -- firms that place deposits for
customers, usually scouring the country for the highest
interest rate.
   While the FDIC wouldn't be allowed to cover uninsured
depositors beginning in 1995, the bill would continue to
allow the Fed to intervene to protect uninsured depositors if
it believed the financial system could be destabilized.
Despite that loophole, the provision is aimed at forcing
large depositors to be more careful about the quality of the
banks and thrifts in which they place money.
   Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Greenspan sounded a gloomy note
about the banking insurance fund, saying that recent
developments underscores "the pressing need for reform of our
deposit insurance system."
   In a four-page letter to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr.
Greenspan said the banking insurance fund's "reserves will
remain under considerable pressure," even after banks next
year begin paying premiums of 19.5 cents per $100 of
deposits, compared with the current 12 cents per $100.
   Mr. Greenspan cited the banks' move into riskier
real-estate lending recently, saying that growth in capital
hasn't kept pace with growth in risk. Nonperforming assets,
he said, are at historical highs while the insurance fund is
at an all-time low. Moreover, contingent liabilities
associated with bank assets held by the fund could also prove
to be higher than expected.
