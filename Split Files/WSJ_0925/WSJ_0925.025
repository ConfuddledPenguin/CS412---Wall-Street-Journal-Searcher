   NEW YORK -- For sale, cheap: bank loans that were made to
some of America's most debt-ridden companies.
   Gung-ho Wall Street traders, who a few years ago created a
market in Brazilian, Mexican and other Third World bank debt,
now are turning their attention to bank loans to leveraged
U.S. companies.

   Most of these loans were made to finance leveraged
buy-outs, in which acquisition debt is paid with funds
generated by the acquired company, and other takeovers. The
borrowers range from Ames Department Stores Inc. to Zapata
Corp. Recent market quotes for such bank loans vary from 20
cents to 70 cents for each dollar of face value.
   The traders' opportunity may become commercial banks'
embarrassment. This is because commercial banks generally
value their corporate loans at 100 cents on the dollar,
unless the borrower stops paying interest. Banks seldom mark
down their loan portfolios to market value to reflect any
preliminary deterioration in credit quality, though
regulators recently have been pressing banks to make some
adjustments.
   As loan traders start to price some leveraged-company debt
at big discounts to face value, "That's going to raise
questions about banks' carrying values of loans," James
McDermott, head of bank-stock research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods, said. "To the extent that {corporate bank-debt
trading} becomes a viable market, it will contribute to
psychological pressure to mark these loans to market."
   Overall trading in distressed corporate bank loans totals
a modest $100 million a month, dealers estimated. But
"Business is really picking up," said Tom Hendrick, a loan
trader at Continental Illinois Corp.
   On Wall Street, the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Salomon
Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. recently set up departments to
trade leveraged-company bank loans. They are following in the
steps of the market pioneers Oppenheimer &amp; Co., R.D. Smith &amp;
Co. and the Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. unit of Bear Stearns Cos.
Even some banks, such as Citicorp and Bankers Trust New York
Corp., are building up specialties in trading these loans.
   The potential pool of tradable bank loans is huge. As of
June 30, the 25 largest U.S. banks held $69 billion of what
regulators call "highly leveraged transaction" loans,
according to a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst, Arthur Soder.
Most of these loans were booked in the late 1980s leverage
binge, often with the lure of big upfront fees for the banks
that made them. The loans generally pay interest of 1 1/2
percentage points above the prime lending rate.
   While many of banks' leveraged loans have been made to
relatively healthy companies, such as Time Warner Inc. and
RJR Nabisco Inc., analysts estimate that 5% to 10% are to
companies that have tumbled into financial distress. Some of
the ailing companies have defaulted on their bank debt;
others continue to make interest payments but may face
financial restructurings to sort out their overall debt
obligations.
   As a result, traders say, a two-tier trading market has
developed. Healthy bank loans routinely are swapped among
banks at 100 cents on the dollar, or close to it.
Troubled-company bank loans, however, are increasingly quoted
by Wall Street traders at big discounts to face value. Buyers
of these loans tend to be so-called vulture funds that seek
profits by investing in troubled companies at cut-rate
prices.
   Selling off corporate loans at a discount to face value is
"a fairly new and revolutionary concept for banks," said
Steven Miller, an analyst at Loan Pricing Corp. who edits
"The Loan Investor" newsletter. Both U.S. and overseas
regulators, however, are leaning hard on banks to rein in
their leveraged lending. This has prompted some regional and
foreign banks to take losses on bad loans and get out, Mr.
Miller said.
   Trading distressed bank debt isn't easy. Most loans are
encumbered with phonebook-sized supporting documents, said
Christopher Mackey, an analyst at Halcyon Distressed
Securities Fund. Switching ownership of a loan can take
weeks. Typical transaction sizes are $5 million or $10
million, putting the market out of reach for most individual
investors.
   As is true of any small market, potential sellers and
buyers often are so far apart in their proposed prices that
trades can't occur. When trades do close, Wall Street firms
or other middlemen typically collect fees of 1% of the loan's
face value. This is a much richer haul than ordinary stock
and bond trading provides for middlemen.
   At cheap enough prices, some vulture funds see opportunity
in buying even the diciest bank loans. Halcyon bought some
Zapata bank debt at 35 cents on the dollar earlier this year,
Mr. Mackey said, even though the energy company incurred big
losses in the late 1980s and missed interest payments on its
bonds last year. Zapata's bank debt recently climbed to 60
cents on the dollar, as surging oil prices have brightened
the company's outlook.
   "A lot of people who historically played in junk bonds
might end up in this market," said Joseph Calhoun, a
bank-loan trader at M.J. Whitman &amp; Co., a New York brokerage
firm. Bank debt generally is the most senior claim against a
company, making it most likely to keep some of its value if a
company gets in trouble, Mr. Calhoun said. In contrast,
high-yield junk bonds carry only a subordinate claim on a
company's assets, making them far riskier for investors.
   For banks, the danger is a replay of the same pressures
for portfolio markdowns that occurred a few years ago with
their Third World loans, Keefe Bruyette's Mr. McDermott said.
When trading of less-developed-country loans got started in
the mid-1980s, big commercial banks argued that traders'
prices were far too low. Bankers insisted that market prices
didn't reflect the real "value" of their loans to Argentina,
Brazil and the like.
   But as Third World debt trading grew, Mr. McDermott said,
banks gradually stopped insisting that these loans were
valued at close to 100 cents on the dollar. Starting in 1987,
big U.S. banks began taking loan-loss reserves that
eventually approximated the market's cut-rate prices for such
loans.
