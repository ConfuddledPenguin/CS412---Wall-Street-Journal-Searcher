   Regarding your Aug. 29 page-one article "Credibility Gap:
UAW and Big Three Face Mutual Mistrust as Auto Talks Heat Up"
on General Motors Corp.'s actions at the Flint, Mich.,
truck-body parts stamping plant: Can management at that plant
be deemed anything but stupid?
   Management obviously had no conception of the optimum
production rate of its manpower or equipment. It gave its
employees an incentive to maximize production. When the
employees doubled the production rate, according to the
article, and held the labor cost constant, management
rewarded the employees by paying them half as much for
doubled production. Is this not known as killing the goose
that laid the golden egg?

   Could this stupidity be why it takes six more man-hours
for GM to produce a car than it does at Japanese plants?
