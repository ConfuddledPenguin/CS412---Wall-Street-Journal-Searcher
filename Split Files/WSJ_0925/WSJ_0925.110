   WASHINGTON -- Losses at the nation's savings and loan
institutions narrowed to $196 million in the second quarter
from $374 million in the first quarter, but the East Coast's
real estate slump continues to cast a shadow over the
industry, regulators said.
   Industrywide results also indicate that more thrifts than
previously thought could need some form of government
assistance, as earnings fell sharply for a group of thrifts
that had been healthy a year ago.

   "This industry is still under siege," said James Barth,
economist at the Auburn University and previously the
government's chief thrift economist.
   Timothy Ryan, the director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said yesterday that his agency is considering
which of the nation's 2,452 thrifts not under government
management might be "segregated" into a special group to be
supervised closely by his agency. Such a plan would allow the
government's overstrained bailout agency, the Resolution
Trust Corp., to shepherd its cash for the very worst S&amp;Ls and
ignore unprofitable but marginally capitalized institutions
for now. "We're looking now at who to take out," Mr. Ryan
said.
   In the past, such strategies have proven catastrophic, as
thrifts that were given time to reverse losses simply wracked
up more. Regulators considering the plan now, however, say
they would restrict those institutions from any growth. The
plan hasn't yet gained final approval.
   Overall results also don't include the government-held
S&amp;Ls, which are under supervision of the RTC. If they were
included, losses would be substantially larger. The bailout
agency will report those results separately.
   But results do include those S&amp;Ls already "bailed out,"
and receiving hefty government assistance. Sixty-one
institutions, many of which struck government assistance
agreements in 1988, received $852 million in aid during the
second quarter. Still, 25 of the 61 thrifts don't meet
current capital requirements. If the results of those
institutions were excluded, the industry's overall loss would
have been $315 million.
   Regulators currently divide privately held thrifts into
four groups, according to profitability. The most alarming
news in the second quarter was how steeply earnings for the
674 "second-tier" thrifts tumbled. This tier contains
relatively healthy thrifts that meet, or are expected to
meet, capital requirements.
   Earnings for that group fell to $31 million from $195
million in the first quarter. For the second quarter of 1989,
they posted earnings of $296 million. Moreover, that group
reported an operating loss of $45.9 million for the latest
quarter, while reporting $101 million in gains on sales of
assets. Regulators attributed the overall decline of the
group to real estate woes.
   This group's health is significant, in that it hasn't been
expected to require government aid. "Their margins just
aren't there," said Bert Ely, an industry consultant in
Alexandria, Va. "These are troubled institutions who aren't
supposed to be."
   The real estate market particularly hurt the industry on
the East Coast, with the Northeast region reporting $93.1
million in net losses, and the Southeast region reporting
$117.4 million in net losses. There were strong earnings,
however, in the Central region, which posted $143.8 million
in earnings, and the West, which reported $50 million in
profit.
   Industrywide, S&amp;Ls continued to brace itself for the real
estate slump, taking a $1.78 billion provision for loan
losses.
   The first-quarter loss was restated from the previously
announced $271 million. The regulators cited a new method of
collecting data.
