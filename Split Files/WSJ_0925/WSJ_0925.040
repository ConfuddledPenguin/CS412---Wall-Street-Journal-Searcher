   A veteran compiler of unauthorized biographies has just
published a book about the Rolling Stones in which he reveals
that Mick Jagger cares more about money than music, that
Keith Richards has taken a lot of drugs, and that the Stones
exercised poor judgment in hiring the Hell's Angels
motorcycle gang as security guards at their tragic Dec. 6,
1969 concert in Altamont, Calif. One anxiously awaits future
efforts by A.E. Hotchner, in which he will perhaps prove that
Ivan Boesky is a greedy sort, and that Richard III had back
problems.
   "Blown Away: The Rolling Stones and the Death of the
Sixties" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 349 pages, $21.95) is yet another
offering from the smut-and-slime school of pop deconstruction
in which performers who have provided countless hours of
pleasure to hundreds of millions of people are mercilessly
traduced. Or, in this case, re-traduced, since Mr. Hotchner's
cut-and-paste job relies heavily on material that has already
appeared elsewhere. Because the Stones themselves did not
cooperate with the author, he is reduced to dishing up
self-serving flashbacks from banished managers, retired
hangers-on, jettisoned girlfriends, unsuccessful siblings and
lorry drivers who knew the boys way back when. Unimpeachable
sources all.

   Needless to say, the most entertaining passages in the
book are the quotes from the Stones themselves, and other
sources. He depicts the Stones as drug-abusing lowlifes who
lucked their way into fame and fortune, and attempts to
indict the entire '60s generation through guilt by
association (the Stones were phonies; you idolized them, so
you were all phonies). Mr. Hotchner clearly believes that the
'60s were a huge farce, and contends that the era of peace,
love and happiness was halted dead in its tracks that fatal
December afternoon in Altamont when four people, including a
black teenager who inadvisedly drew a gun on the Angels,
died.
   Okay, so what else is new? It's generally agreed that the
Altamont debacle put the old kibosh on the '60s, but that
story has been retold a thousand times: in books, magazine
articles and in the film "Gimme Shelter." As for Jagger and
drugs, Richards and drugs, Brian Jones and drugs, an entire
generation and drugs, well, yeah, A.E., a lot of drugs did
get consumed back in the '60s. As P.J. O'Rourke says: If you
can still remember the '60s, you probably weren't part of
them. Or was that one of Bill Bennett's lines?
   Mr. Hotchner manifestly wasn't part of the '60s. Now 70
years old, he made his name digging up dirt on Papa Hemingway
and Doris Day, and probably would have been better off
writing "Fogged In: Mel Torme and the Death of the Forties."
Sad to say, there simply isn't much in this book that a
hundred million rock 'n' roll fans don't already know. The
Beatles' clean-cut image was hoked up? Thanks, A.E., never
would have guessed. Brian Jones may have been murdered? Yeah,
seem to remember having read that somewhere. The Stones
weren't really all that talented as musicians? No, let me
guess what's coming next: Ringo Starr was no Gene Krupa,
right?
   The culturally marooned Hotchner is obsessed with the idea
that Jones, a mildly talented musician who founded the
Stones, was forced out of the band by the less gifted Jagger
and Richards. Again, this is not news; rock fans have known
for 20 years that Jagger and Richards wanted Jones out of the
band, in large measure because his chronic drug abuse
prevented him from performing onstage, whereas Richards's
chronic drug abuse did not. But to call Jones more talented
than Jagger and Richards is idiotic; they were the ones who
wrote the hits that made the Stones the world's greatest rock
'n' roll band.
   Mr. Hotchner's smear job on people who grew up in the
1960s is similarly fatuous. At the end of the book, he runs
down a laundry list of areas where the "Jagger Generation"
(it was actually the Dylan Generation, but never mind)
failed, excoriating kids who went to Woodstock because they
now read The Wall Street Journal, drink vintage wines, and
voted for Reagan and Bush. Well, what'd you expect them to
do: Vote for Dukakis? How many drugs do you think we were
taking back then? And anyway, what about Greenpeace and
recycling and daycare and Ben &amp; Jerry and fresh pasta and all
that other neat stuff?
   In addition to its egregious conceptual flaws, the book is
marred by shoddy reporting. Mr. Hotchner says that after
Altamont the Stones albums became "banal." Well, not exactly:
After Altamont, the Stones released "Sticky Fingers" and
"Exile on Main Street," each a masterpiece. He claims that
over the years Richards's creative spirit dried up. Gee, it
didn't seem to have dried up in the 1987 film tribute to
Chuck Berry ("Hail] Hail] Rock 'n' Roll") that he helped
organize, or in the fistful of hits he co-wrote with Jagger
over the past 20 years (including "Shattered" and "Emotional
Rescue," or in his razor-sharp 1988 solo album "Talk Is
Cheap"). But, then again, talk is cheap.
   These aren't the only errors. Cheltenham, where Jones grew
up, is not a "dreary" English city but a lovely spa town
nestled at the edge of the Cotswolds. And no, though the
Stones did write plenty of songs that kids could dance to,
the quirky "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby? (Standing in the
Shadows)" was certainly not one of them. These are the sorts
of flubs that the author could have avoided if he'd only
bothered to fact-check his manuscript with any one of, say,
500 million Rolling Stones fans out here. Maybe he didn't
bother because he figured, hey, it's only rock 'n' roll.
Well, it is only rock 'n' roll. But we like it.
