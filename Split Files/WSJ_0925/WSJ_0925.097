   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. said it
signed a confidentiality agreement with Kansas Gas &amp; Electric
Co, under which Kansas City P&amp;L will be allowed to review
nonpublic information about the Wichita utility.
   Kansas City P&amp;L has launched a $27-a-share, or $857
million offer for Kansas Gas &amp; Electric. Kansas G&amp;E has
called the offer inadequate and legally questionable, and
urged shareholders not to tender their shares.

   Kansas G&amp;E also announced in mid-September that it is in
talks over a possible acquisition by a third party, which it
won't identify. At that time, it said that it would provide
similar nonpublic information to Kansas City P&amp;L, subject to
a confidentiality pact.
   Yesterday's announcement marks the completion of that
arrangement. Kansas City P&amp;L said the agreement is a
"desirable first step which we hope will lead to broader
negotiations."
