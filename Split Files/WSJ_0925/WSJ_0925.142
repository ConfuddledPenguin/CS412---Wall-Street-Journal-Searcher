   SALTON SEA, Calif. -- A flier circulating among employees
at the Unocal Corp. geothermal plant here pictures the
facility opposite a battle tank, a gun and an oil barrel and
proclaims: "There is an alternative."
   With the Mideast crisis shaking oil markets, "this here
should be Unocal's new ad campaign," drawls Olin
Whitescarver, veteran manager of the company's operations in
this desert valley.

   The project to convert steamy brine from deep within the
Earth to electricity is one of the "crown jewels" that Unocal
Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier likes to discuss. The
operation, which only recently turned profitable, helps make
this midsized oil company the world's leading producer of
geothermal energy.
   Unocal's two other "crown jewels" are its huge natural-gas
reserves, which are already enhancing its short-term profit
outlook, and an experimental oil-shale business, which could
yield major long-term benefits if a continuing oil crisis
spurs demand for alternative fuels. Unocal thus is one of the
oil companies that stand to benefit from the upheaval in the
Mideast, even though it isn't one of those with huge
petroleum reserves.
   But despite aggressive new management devoted to
strengthening Unocal's niche in the industry, the nation's
13th-largest oil company remains haunted by a legacy of the
1980s: the huge $6.1 billion debt load Unocal built up as it
defeated a hostile bid from T. Boone Pickens.
   "We had to mortgage our future," grouses Mr. Stegemeier,
arguing that without that debt Unocal might now have nearly
twice its current 800-million-barrel oil reserves. "Every day
as we walked into the office, we had to write a symbolic
check for $2 million just to cover the interest," he says.
These days, writing that symbolic check, which now is down to
$1 million, "is still painful."
   Unocal has paid heavily to remain independent. To slash
its debt to today's approximately $4 billion, it has had to
close a Beaumont, Texas, refinery that had accounted for a
quarter of its crude-oil processing capacity. It also has
formed a joint venture to run its Midwest refining and
marketing operations, disposed of some Canadian and Norwegian
assets and even sold its headquarters building on the edge of
downtown Los Angeles.
   In addition, Unocal has nearly halved its capital spending
in the past five years. That cutback creates the prospect
that it will soon have to pour hundreds of millions of
dollars into refinery improvements and other efforts to catch
up with competitors that lead in developing less-polluting
gasolines. And Unocal remains hampered in overhauling its
old-fashioned marketing, which critics say makes Unocal
vulnerable to financially stronger companies such as its
hometown rival, Atlantic Richfield Co.
   While competitors emphasize self-service pumps, which by
saving labor help hold down gasoline prices, Unocal sticks
with the same service-oriented, premium-priced appeal it used
when a 1949 TV commercial showed a young Marilyn Monroe
tooling up to a Union Oil station in her sports car and
cooing to the eager attendant to put oil "in Cynthia's little
tummy."
   With survival in the post-Pickens era apparently assured,
Mr. Stegemeier faces what he concedes is "the more difficult
part: positioning ourselves for growth in the '90s."
   Changing strategies suits the 62-year-old executive far
better than it did his iron-willed predecessor, Fred L.
Hartley, the engineer who ruled the company for nearly a
quarter-century before retiring in 1988. Mr. Hartley, now 73,
shaped Unocal's commitment to geothermal energy and shale oil
-- a program that wags labeled "Hartley's Folly" because
shale oil is so much more expensive than conventional crude.
Mr. Hartley was also seen as unbending when asset sales and
other wrenching moves might have been prudent.
   The contrast between old and new is striking. Mr. Hartley,
who loosed an acerbic wit on all who dared question his
authority, dismissed securities analysts as "peons" and told
dividend-starved shareholders that the company knew better
ways to spend money. Mr. Stegemeier projects an image of
corporate affability, certainly to shareholders; he cheered
them with a 40% dividend increase and a 2-for-1 stock split
last November. He gives managers considerable leeway to make
decisions and can laugh at himself. At an interview, he
greets a reporter with a mouthful of candy and apologizes
impishly.
   Moreover, Unocal "has been completely turned around in
terms of substantive focus since he took over," says Bernard
Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
   Much of the Stegemeier plan hinges on developing Unocal's
natural-gas reserves of more than six trillion cubic feet --
equal to more than a billion barrels of oil.
   Unocal's U.S. gas position, which is second only to that
of Occidental Petroleum Corp. in percentage of total company
reserves, is especially strong in the Gulf of Mexico. While
battling Mr. Pickens, Unocal bundled its properties there
into a separate, publicly traded Union Exploration
partnership, which subsequently was converted into a
corporation. Lately, Unocal has had "the lowest finding costs
and best reserve replacement of any major oil company" in the
gulf, says Frederick P. Leuffer, a C.J. Lawrence analyst.
   Unocal also turned to natural gas for its first big
acquisition since the Pickens battle: the $336 million
purchase of a Gulf Coast exploration and production company,
Prairie Holding Co.
   Some analysts remain skeptical about gas demand. "Don't go
overboard counting on natural gas," warns Marc Cohen of
Kidder Peabody. "If my reading is correct, nationwide there
is only about 160,000 barrels a day of consumption that could
readily be converted from oil to natural gas." But Unocal and
others expect natural-gas prices to rise this winter, after
falling this summer to the lowest levels in nearly 10 years,
though they will lag well behind fuel oil, the nearest
alternative. "We now have a window of opportunity to develop
our reserves and bring them to market rather quickly," says
John F. Imle Jr., senior vice president for energy resources.
   Industry experts predict that if crude-oil prices hold at
current levels, natural gas will surge to more than $2 per
thousand cubic feet from about $1.50 now. Figuring that every
10-cent increase in gas prices yields a seven-cent rise in
Unocal's per-share earnings, some analysts have recently
increased their 1990 earnings estimate by nearly a third, to
about $1.50 a share. Unocal earned $260 million, or $1.11 a
share, on $11.35 billion of revenue last year. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Unocal's stock
closed at $33.50, down 12 1/2 cents on the day.
   Geothermal's role in Unocal's future is much smaller. The
company has reserves equal to about 216 million barrels of
oil -- a quarter of its crude reserves -- and geothermal
accounted for a mere $188 million of sales last year.
   Acquired in 1965, the geothermal business took off after
gasoline price increases during the 1973 oil embargo made
alternative fuels viable. The geothermal operations now
extend to northern and southern California, the Philippines
and Indonesia, and Unocal plans to spend several hundred
million dollars over the next several years for further
exploration and development along the Pacific Rim's geologic
"ring of fire." Says Mr. Imle, "World tensions caused by oil
availability can only improve the outlook for geothermal."
   Its limitations, though, are important. Not transportable
like oil, geothermal energy is restricted to a few regions
where the plates of the Earth's crust join to create the
right subterranean conditions. Even there, the steam isn't in
unlimited supply. Production from Unocal's largest and oldest
geothermal project, in the Geysers field north of San
Francisco, declined recently as the underground pressure
pushing the steam out of the ground fell.
   Geothermal generating costs also raise a substantial
problem. While most power costs 4.5 cents to 7.5 cents per
kilowatt hour, Unocal's Salton Sea facility charges as much
as 9.5 cents to provide electricity for SCEcorp's Southern
California Edison.
   Oil shale fever peaked in the late 1970s, when experts
were predicting $100-a-barrel crude oil by the year 2000. Mr.
Hartley, who had written a college thesis on shale
development, poured more than $1 billion into producing
synthetic crude from shale. But Unocal's Parachute Creek,
Colo., plant, beset with technical problems for years, never
came close to making economic sense. After Mr. Hartley
retired, company officials considered closing it.
   Now Unocal remains committed to the shale project, which
produces oil for $40 a barrel, because of a federal
price-support contract that could total $400 million by 1996.
That contract allowed Unocal to show modest positive cash
flow from shale operations earlier this year, though it
suffered losses again in the second quarter. Unocal has been
quietly courting outside investors for the project, including
Japan National Oil Co.
   Although the promise of shale oil has never been
fulfilled, Unocal gains a patriotic aura by keeping the
project alive. The Western U.S. has at least 600 billion
barrels of recoverable shale reserves, roughly equal to the
proven reserves of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. The U.S. "could face a new decade of price shocks
and supply disruptions," Mr. Stegemeier said a year ago in
what now sounds like a prophetic speech. "America's oil-shale
reserves would then become an abundant, economically
competitive energy alternative."
   But Unocal won't invest heavily on shale in the wake of
Iraq's Kuwait invasion. Still smarting from the 1986
crude-price collapse, which caught the whole industry off
guard, its executives say they don't count on prices staying
high. "We don't want to get caught spending money we may not
get," cautions Claude Brinegar, the chief financial officer
and a former U.S. transportation secretary.
   Yet Unocal has pushed ahead with exploration. It kept
reserves stable through most of the 1980s, at more than 1.9
billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents. Last year,
according to C.J. Lawrence's Mr. Leuffer, Unocal was the only
one of 17 major domestic oil companies that on a worldwide
basis "fully replaced production from new discoveries,
extensions and enhanced recovery." In fact, he adds, it
replaced 142% of world-wide reserves, excluding acquisitions
and revised estimates of the oil that can be recovered from
given fields.
   The company's push into new technology is one reason. At
the Hartley Research Center, a campus-like compound in Orange
County, Calif., scientists work on computerized
three-dimensional seismic mapping systems that have allowed
Unocal to tap small sand reservoirs in Thailand. And on
Platform Irene, in the Pacific waters north of Santa Barbara,
Unocal is using the world's longest single horizontal well to
improve recovery. The $3.5 million well costs more than twice
as much as a vertical well, "but that's economically more
viable than building a new platform," says field
superintendent C.B. Beauchamp.
   Increasingly, Unocal is taking a risky road by exploring
and producing overseas. Currently in Thailand, Indonesia,
Burma, Syria and the Netherlands, it may soon look in
Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other countries long off-limits
to Western investment. The returns could be significant
because finding a few large fields could make Unocal an oil
giant.
   "Petroleum geology has to guide our exploration, not
politics," Mr. Stegemeier says. "If we let politics guide us,
we'd be drilling for oil in Switzerland."
   Unocal's marketing, hampered by low budgets, is an
acknowledged weak spot. The company relies on its wits to
develop relatively inexpensive publicity campaigns. When
Arco, Chevron and Shell undertook expensive reformulations of
their gasolines this year to cut pollution, Unocal countered
by offering to pay $700 apiece to buy 8,300 smog-belching old
cars in the Los Angeles area and scrap them. The $10 million
plan includes free emission checks for older cars and a small
fleet of Unocal trucks that cruise freeways and help stranded
motorists.
   But the car-crushing campaign is mostly a stalling tactic.
One California state agency is voting late this week on
standards to force companies to develop cleaner gasolines by
1993; another agency seeks refinery improvements in the Los
Angeles area that could cost Unocal hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   Environmental issues have long plagued Unocal, certainly
since the 1969 platform blowout that spilled thousands of
barrels of oil into Santa Barbara Channel. Unocal literature
calls that mishap "the major event that helped coalesce
environmental-protection groups into a powerful lobby." The
company's current environmental program wins praise from
regulators, though. California's South Coast Air Quality
Management District donated $100,000 to the auto-scrapping
campaign.
   But at a recent news conference on the environment, Unocal
executives displaying a flattened white Maverick for TV
cameras were chided about Unocal's raising pump prices so
quickly after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Unocal was a likely target
because of the higher prices at full-service stations. "We
look for the carriage trade," Mr. Stegemeier says.
   Unocal's marketing approach, however, may soon go the way
of the buggy whip. Full-service is a graying market, some
analysts say, and "with consumers very conscious of the
run-up in prices and conservation in vogue, initially you'd
expect to see a preference for lower-priced gasolines,"
analyst Mr. Leuffer says. He believes Unocal's market share
could dip for a while.
   So Unocal executives are looking more closely at switching
to self-service and even convenience stores similar to those
pioneered by Arco. Refining and marketing must "adapt to the
demands of the '90s," says Roger Beach, Unocal's senior vice
president in charge of those areas.
   With Unocal emphasizing moves to remain competitive, it
dismisses the takeover rumors that continue to dog it. Mr.
Stegemeier says Unocal "hasn't been for sale for 100 years,
and we have no intent of putting the company up for sale. We
believe the things we've done to restructure the company will
keep us independent."
