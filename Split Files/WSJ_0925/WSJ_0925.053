   While artists of lesser stature trumpet their new releases
with hyperbolic fanfare, Bob Dylan continues to write and
record his songs, distribute his albums and move on to the
next project. His latest recording, "Under the Red Sky"
(Columbia), is raw, spontaneous, and by design not very
pretty; its lyrics are cryptic and mature. So it's everything
rock albums aren't today. For that alone, it's a gem.
   Under the guidance of producer Don Was, and aided by Al
Kooper, whose whistling organ licks propelled "Like a Rolling
Stone," among other time-framed classics, Dylan has returned
to his circa 1968 rocking roots, spewing a volley of words
over a pounding band, flinging images against a torrent of
drums, bass and whirling guitars. Close your eyes and there
he is, the shock of curly hair, the sunglasses, the Fender
Stratocaster slung over his shoulder, the leather jacket, the
torn, faded jeans: The more than 20 years it's been since
"Blonde on Blonde" vanish with a listening. Taken with last
year's pensive, Daniel Lanois-produced "Oh Mercy," "Under a
Red Sky" demonstrates that there need be no "new Bob Dylan"
as long as the real thing's still around.

   Speaking of Daniel Lanois, in 1989 the producer stepped in
to help the Neville Brothers find their own voice on "Yellow
Moon," the group's most successful record, both commercially
and artistically. This year the Nevilles, sans Lanois, have
taken their sound a step further and the resulting recording,
"Brother's Keeper" (A&amp;M), is their best work. By now,
finally, Aaron Neville is a star and rightfully so:
"Aaronesque" should be an adjective to describe a sweet,
heart-wrenching and perfect vocal performance. The other
Neville vocalists, gruff Art and buoyant Cyril, contribute
quality performances, and the material, as it did on "Yellow
Moon," matches the brothers' talent. Check out the snap and
funk of "Brother Jake" or the plaintive moan of Link Wray's
"Fallin' Rain" and try to come up with a band that's better
at getting an audience to dance and cry within a beat. One
quibble: The Nevilles apparently have jettisoned guitarist
Brian Stoltz, whose work was a high point on both "Yellow
Moon" and Dylan's "Oh Mercy." On the plus side, the song
"Fearless" features the booming voice of Linda Ronstadt, with
whom Aaron Neville had the huge 1989 hit "Don't Know Much."
Ronstadt produced Aaron's forthcoming, much-awaited solo
album.
   If the Neville Brothers aren't America's best band, Living
Colour may very well be. The New York-based quartet is heavy
metal's most defiantly versatile act, and on their new album,
"Time's Up" (Epic), they display their wide range: hard-core
power wailing, a dab of rap, a flicker of jazz, warm
harmonies, and in "Love Rears Its Ugly Head," a witty blues.
Crushing four-square rock is still their metier, however, and
there's plenty of it here, propelled by a ferocious rhythm
section of Muzz Skillings and William Calhoun. Led by the
inventive guitarist Vernon Reid, Living Colour may be too
gifted for its own good, but every cut on "Time's Up" is a
delight. And loud.
   Following 1988's studied "Blue Skies," one might've
expected another flawless rendering of classic,
acoustic-based jazz by the New York vocalist Cassandra
Wilson. Not so. Her latest, "Jumpworld" (JMT Records), may be
a classic, but you won't find the likes of "Shall We Dance"
and "I've Grown Accustomed to His Face" here. "Jumpworld" is
a fierce flood of colors, all drawn from the broad palette of
today's jazz and featuring Wilson's extraordinary voice.
Driving her trio and guest performers Steve Coleman, David
Gilmour, Greg Osby and Lonnie Plaxico, Wilson is dynamic,
adventurous and oh so confident. She proves herself a fine
producer and talented songwriter as well, equally adept at
seductive jazz and ardent funk. Where her gifts will take her
next is anybody's guess.
   "Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings" (Columbia)
contains every recording ever made by the legendary bluesman.
The 41 tracks -- 29 songs and 12 alternate takes, marvelously
restored by Frank Abbey -- include Johnson's familiar
compositions "Cross Road Blues," "Sweet Home Chicago," "Love
in Vain," "Come in My Kitchen," among others. While it's a
delight to hear Johnson sing his own songs, it's a revelation
to hear his hypnotic guitar playing. In the liner notes, Eric
Clapton calls Johnson the greatest bluesman who ever lived,
and this collection goes a long way to support his claim. The
multirecord set, part of Columbia's "Roots 'n' Blues" series,
is lovingly packaged, and includes a Johnson biography by
Stephen C. LeVere, a bevy of photos -- including one of
Johnson's death certificate; the amorous bluesman was 27
years old when he contracted pneumonia after being poisoned
by a jealous rival -- and the annotated lyrics to each song.
The set is precisely the kind of tribute a master like
Johnson deserves.
