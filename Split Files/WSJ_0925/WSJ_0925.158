   HILTON HOTELS Corp. (Beverly Hills, Calif.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing for possible
downgrade ratings on about $175 million of Hilton Hotels debt
and the commercial paper rating of Hilton's Hotel Waldorf
Astoria Corp. subsidiary. Moody's said it is concerned that
softness in Hilton's hotel and casino businesses could result
in reduced debt protection measurements over the intermediate
term. Those concerns are deepened by the company's plan to
buy back up to six million shares of its common stock, the
rating agency said.
