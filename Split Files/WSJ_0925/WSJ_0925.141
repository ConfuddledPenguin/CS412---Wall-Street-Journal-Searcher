   Jose Maria Aristrain S.A., a family-owned Spanish
steelmaker, canceled an agreement to sell 80% of its shares
to Banco Espanol de Credito's industrial holding company and
to British Steel PLC for about 40 billion pesetas ($407
million).
   Acquisition of the Aristrain stake would have converted
the holding company of Banco Espanol, which is known as
Banesto, into one of Spain's leading nongovernment-owned
steel companies. It also would have given British Steel an
important foothold in the Spanish market.

   A Banesto official said the company will seek ways of
collaborating with British Steel.
   Aristrain officials weren't immediately available for
comment, and British Steel declined to make a statement.
   Under the accord, reached in July after months of
conflicting reports about the sale, Industrial &amp; Financiera
de Banesto S.A. -- 76%-owned by Banesto -- and British Steel
were each to have acquired 40% of Aristrain. The Aristrain
family was to have retained a 20% stake, half of which was to
be sold eventually to Spanish state-owned steelmaker Empresa
Nacional de Siderurgica S.A., or Ensidesa.
