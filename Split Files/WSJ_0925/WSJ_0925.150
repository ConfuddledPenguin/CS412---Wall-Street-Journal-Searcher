   WORCESTER, Mass. -- John M. Nelson, the longtime
president, chief executive officer and chairman of Norton Co.
who said the acquisition by the Cie de Saint Gobain S.A.
would not result in layoffs, was replaced yesterday by the
French industrial giant.
   Mr. Nelson, who helped steer the company away from the
hostile bidder BTR PLC in favor of Saint Gobain, will become
a consultant to Norton, a maker of abrasives, plastics,
ceramics and chemical-process products. The company had 1989
revenue of $1.53 billion.

   His successor will be Michel L. Besson, who has been vice
chairman, president and chief executive officer of
CertainTeed Corp. in Valley Forge, Pa. That company, acquired
by Saint Gobain in 1987, is a maker of building products.
   Mr. Besson will now run both CertainTeed and Norton for
Saint Gobain, according to the spokesman.
   Mr. Nelson could not be reached for comment.
