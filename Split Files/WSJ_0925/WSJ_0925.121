   LOS ANGELES -- Oliver A. Trigg, former chairman of Family
Savings &amp; Loan Association, pleaded innocent in federal court
here to charges that he defrauded the thrift in a complex
scheme to take control of Family using Family's own money.
   Mr. Trigg was indicted by a federal grand jury this month
and charged with 15 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud, money
laundering, false statements and tax fraud. If convicted, he
faces a maximum of 94 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

   According to the indictment, Mr. Trigg, while serving as
chairman but holding no equity in the thrift, arranged for
Family to lend $2.5 million to a third party to develop a
real-estate property. Then $1,240,000 of the money allegedly
was laundered into Mr. Trigg's personal bank account and used
to buy 51% of Family.
   Mr. Trigg attracted local media attention in August 1987
when he acquired control of the Los Angeles-based thrift,
partly because with assets of more than $140 million, Family
was one of the nation's largest black-owned S&amp;Ls. Family is
still in operation after OFC Inc., based in Washington, D.C.,
acquired control in January.
