   DENVER -- Newmont Mining Corp. said it agreed to support a
proposal by its 24%-owned Newmont Australia Ltd. to acquire
BHP Gold Mines Ltd. in a stock swap valued at about 475
million Australian dollars (US$394 million).
   Newmont Mining rejected an earlier offer by Poseidon Gold
Ltd., an Australian concern, to acquire the Newmont Australia
shares it doesn't own in a stock swap valued at A$780
million.

   Newmont Australia said its directors and the directors of
BHP agreed to the new proposal and recommended the stock deal
to BHP shareholders.
   Broken Hill Proprietary, an Australian steel, mining and
oil company, holds about 55% of BHP and would hold about 23%
of the merged company if the offer is accepted. Newmont
Mining would hold about 14% of the new company, which would
be renamed, according to Newmont Mining Vice Chairman Richard
Leather.
   "The combined company will be a stronger and more
attractive company with a stronger operating group, stronger
management and stronger prospects," said Mr. Leather.
Acquiring BHP would boost Newmont Australia's 1991 gold
production some 75% to 790,000 ounces from 450,000 ounces, he
said. Combined, the company would have around four million
ounces of gold reserves at its gold mines and another 11
million ounces of resources that it might mine in the future.
BHP and Newmont Australia jointly own the Telfer Gold Mine,
which is expected to produce about 300,000 ounces of gold in
1990.
   In August, Newmont Mining sold nearly half of its shares,
or 20% of the stock outstanding, of Newmont Australia to
Poseidon Gold for A$166 million. At that time, Poseidon
offered to acquire the rest of Newmont Australia stock by
swapping one share of Poseidon stock for every two shares of
Newmont Australia stock. Since then, both Newmont Australia
and Newmont Mining have rejected that offer.
   Newmont Mining said it will continue to explore proposals
to liquidate its holdings in Newmont Australia after the BHP
deal is completed. Newmont Mining has said it is interested
in pursuing other gold prospects in Indonesia and Papua New
Guinea instead of retaining its interest in Australian gold
production.
