   NEW YORK -- A federal judge ordered the government to
release to the news media today an edited version of its
sentencing memorandum concerning Michael Milken, who is
scheduled to be sentenced next Monday.
   The memorandum, filed in court under seal this month,
contains information about the six securities fraud-related
crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty in April and a host
of other alleged crimes that the government believes he
committed. The memo, designed to encourage federal Judge
Kimba Wood to impose a stiff sentence on the former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief, is more than 200 pages
long.

   In her order making the memorandum public, Judge Wood
ordered the government to delete names of unindicted
co-conspirators and of other individuals and entities who
remain under investigation. Judge Wood also ordered
prosecutors to delete the portions of the memo that relate to
Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell Milken.
   Lowell Milken was charged with securities and tax fraud in
an indictment filed last year, but the government agreed to
dismiss all charges against Lowell Milken when his brother
agreed to plead guilty.
   Meanwhile, Michael Milken's lawyers said they would
release their client's own memorandum, which seeks to rebut
many of the government's charges, today. Mr. Milken's
attorneys had sought to bar the release of either of the
memos until the sentencing.
   Lawyers for Mr. Milken argued that early release of the
memos could lead to "improper pressure" on the court. But
Judge Wood said that "delaying release may well prejudice the
ability of the press to understand the substance" of the
government's allegations. She added, "I'm not going to be
influenced by any publicity."
   It appears that the government's memorandum contains much
information that has never been made public. Yesterday
afternoon, lawyers for three "John Does" filed sealed memos
with the court asking that the government refrain from
releasing portions of the government's sentencing memo that
refer to their clients. The identities of the three clients
isn't known, and none of the three law firms has ever
appeared before on documents filed in connection with the
case against Mr. Milken.
   Still unresolved yesterday was whether Judge Wood, in
handing down a sentence, would even consider the allegations
of wrongdoing beyond the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded
guilty. If she agrees to the government's request that she
consider the further allegations, Mr. Milken would be
entitled to a hearing in which he could seek to defend
himself. Regardless of whether additional allegations are
considered, the maximum sentence for his crimes is 28 years
in prison. But the sentencing judge has wide discretion
within that limitation.
   One of the six counts to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty
involves a conspiracy he engaged in with convicted former
stock speculator Ivan Boesky to violate the law. Judge Wood
said that neither the government's nor Mr. Milken's
sentencing memos provided enough information to determine the
extent of the conspiracy without a hearing.
   Arthur Liman, an attorney for Mr. Milken, said he would
submit additional details of Mr. Milken's illegal activities
involving Mr. Boesky by tomorrow.
