   SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government,
responding to U.S. pressure, said it would donate about $220
million in cash, food, transportation and military equipment
to the multinational effort against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Undersecretary of
State Richard Solomon visited Seoul in recent weeks to argue
for at least $450 million in aid. But a Seoul official said
Korea's economic problems, exacerbated by recent floods,
limited the size of the contribution.

   Korea said it would provide $120 million in cash, air and
sea transportation, and supplies such as military uniforms,
tents and gas masks. Jordan, Turkey and Egypt would receive
30,000 metric tons of rice valued at $10 million and could
apply for $40 million of low-interest loans. Korea also would
supply $49.5 million of "necessity of life" goods to the
three nations.
