   A penny saved is a penny earned?
   It may look that way, based on the long-term total-return
numbers for stocks, bonds and Treasury bills. These numbers,
often cited by Wall Street marketers, suggest that investors
with diversified portfolios stay comfortably ahead of
inflation over the long haul.

   But don't bet on it. Revising the numbers to account for
taxes and for modest transaction costs shows how difficult it
is to preserve real wealth -- let alone make money -- by
saving and investing.
   "It totally ruins the portfolio to be a taxable individual
investor," says Laurence Siegel, managing director of
Ibbotson Associates Inc., a Chicago-based investment research
firm.
   For instance, the unadulterated Ibbotson numbers show that
over 64 years, 1926 through 1989, stocks generated an average
compound annual return of 10.31%. That compares with 4.55%
for long-term government bonds and 3.61% for Treasury bills.
   Looked at in terms of dollars and cents, $1 put into the
stock market on Dec. 31, 1925, would have grown to $534.46 by
Dec. 31, 1989, the Ibbotson data show. A dollar invested in
long-term government bonds, meanwhile, would have appreciated
only to $17.30, and $1 in Treasury bills would have grown to
$9.67.
   That, at least, is the way it looks on paper. But in the
real world, where individual investors have to contend with
transaction costs, taxes and inflation, the results are a lot
less impressive. Even modest bites out of an investor's
return make huge differences in the amount of wealth
accumulated over time.
   For purposes of its study, Ibbotson assumed annual
transaction and management costs equal to 0.5 percentage
point on stocks and bonds. That's about the size of the gap
between annual returns on no-load index mutual funds and on
the benchmark stock and bond indexes they track. Overall
costs would be much greater for most nonindex mutual funds or
for managed accounts. The cost estimate for Treasury bills
was 0.25 percentage point a year, in line with money market
investments.
   Those modest charges, however, would reduce the wealth
accumulated by stock and bond investors by about one-third
over the 64-year period. They would cost Treasury bill
investors about 14%.
   Then there are taxes. Here, the real blow for investors
isn't the currently hotly debated levy on capital gains, but
ordinary income taxes on interest and dividends. Although top
tax rates have frequently been much higher, just applying the
current 28% federal rate to dividends over the past 64 years
would have hacked 36% off the end value of the stock
portfolio, thanks to compounding. Taking all this into
account, at the end of 64 years the investor of $1 would have
just $161.55, even without the tax on capital gains.
   Obviously, the damage is even worse on high-yield stocks,
whose dividends are high relative to their prices. "Tilting
your portfolio toward high-dividend stocks never works," says
Ibbotson's Mr. Siegel.
   "High and low-dividend stocks have historically had the
same total return," which includes price changes as well as
dividends, he says. "But if your dividends are taxed, it
always works best to go with low-dividend stocks," which get
a bigger portion of their return through price changes, he
says.
   That's because taxes on capital gains can be deferred
until the investor actually takes profits and sells the
stock. This not only favors low-yield growth stocks but also
gives stocks in general a slight tax advantage over bonds and
Treasury bills. Bond and money-market investors can't defer
taxes, because their returns come from interest payments,
which are taxed as they come.
   "Deferring taxes isn't as good as avoiding them, but it's
better than `pay as you go' -- and the longer you can defer,
the better," says Mr. Siegel.
   For example, subtracting capital gains taxes at today's
28% rate shrinks the stock portfolio's end value to $113.40
if gains are realized only once in 20 years. A shorter-term
investor who turns the portfolio over every five years does
worse, ending up with $87.62.
   If the investor lives in a high-tax area -- such as New
York City, where the total income tax burden can run about
38% -- the damage can be stunning. Taxes on dividends alone
would wipe out 43% of a stock investor's wealth, and capital
gains taxes paid every 20 years would take a further 9%,
leaving $74.17 at the end of 64 years. Heavy traders, who
realize the portfolio's gains every five years, would end up
with just $52.13 after being taxed at 38%.
   What's more, "today's tax rates are among the lowest
ever," says Mr. Siegel. "You have to look before World War II
to find lower rates -- and income taxes are likely to go up
in the future, damaging investors' portfolios more than these
numbers indicate."
   Treasury bonds and bills do offer some tax relief to
individuals in high-tax areas, as interest on them is exempt
from state and local taxes. And most municipal bonds are
totally tax free.
   The woes of being a taxable individual investor become
especially graphic when inflation is taken into account.
   Stocks, it turns out, are the only investment that
reliably defended investors' wealth in the long run. That was
true over the 1926-89 period as well as in the shorter
1970-89 period -- which included some of the biggest bull and
bear markets in history. Owners of bonds and Treasury bills
actually lost money in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms in
both periods.
   In broad terms, the numbers reinforce the accepted
investment wisdom: Investors should skew their taxable
portfolios heavily toward stocks and should practice a
long-term buy-and-hold strategy. Such a strategy not only
helps insulate the portfolio from the stock market's
volatility but also minimizes taxes and costs.
   Individuals also should make maximum use of tax-favored
vehicles such as individual retirement accounts, which defer
taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains -- even though
these accounts are no longer fully deductible at higher
income levels.
   Of course, the past isn't necessarily prologue to the
future. Some analysts see bonds offering particularly good
value these days, which suggests they may provide better
returns for the risk than stocks right now.
   In the long term, "stocks are always and everywhere the
place to be, but . . . my guess is that stock and bond
returns are going to get closer together in the next three or
four years, even on an after-tax basis, than they've been in
the postwar period," says Charles Clough, chief investment
strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
