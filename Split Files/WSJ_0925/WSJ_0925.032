   ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir and Air France, both laggards in
the trend toward service hookups between domestic and
international carriers, intend to create links between the
U.S. carrier's domestic business and the French carrier's
overseas business.
   As part of a proposed marketing agreement, USAir, a unit
of USAir Group Inc., and Air France said they will offer each
other blocked space for resale on certain international
flights. Starting in the spring, USAir will allocate seats to
Air France on its Philadelphia-Paris flights. In the spring
of 1992, the French state-owned carrier will reciprocate by
providing USAir space on its flights between Paris and
another of USAir's major domestic hubs. That hub has yet to
be selected.

   Other cooperative efforts between the two companies may
involve joint advertising and sales promotions; sharing of
flight codes; cargo development; enhanced automation of seat
selection and advance boarding; and shared terminal
facilities at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport when Air
France starts the Philadelphia-Paris service.
   Air France, already a partner in USAir's frequent traveler
program, will now offer the domestic carrier access to about
100 European points through Charles de Gaulle. In the U.S.,
airports served by both companies include New York's John F.
Kennedy, Newark, Boston, Washington Dulles International,
Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Houston.
