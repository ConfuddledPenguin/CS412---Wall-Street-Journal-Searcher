   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Westwood One Inc. said it signed an
agreement with New York-based Infinity Broadcasting Corp. to
bring on 14 of Infinity's 17 radio stations in the top U.S.
radio markets as Westwood One affiliates.
   Terms were't disclosed. William Battison, Westwood One's
president and chief financial officer, said the affiliation
will give the company a wider audience for its programming
and allow it to sell its commercials at a greater premium.
"This will clearly add significant audience in the youth
demographic, and it will help our programming business," he
said. Norman Pattiz, Westwood One's chairman and chief
executive officer, noted that the agreement "assures that we
will continue to have strong and predictable ratings growth."

one is the nation's largest distributor of radio programming
