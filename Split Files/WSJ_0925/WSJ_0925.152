   Micron Technology Inc., still suffering the effects of a
drastic drop in chip prices, reported that net income in its
fiscal fourth-quarter fell 81% on nearly flat sales.
   But profit increased for the second consecutive quarter,
as the chip company continued to emerge from two quarters of
near-zero net income. Micron said net for the quarter ended
Aug. 30 was $3 million, or eight cents a share, compared with
net income of $16 million, or 42 cents a share, in the
year-ago quarter. Fourth-quarter sales were $105.3 million,
up from $103 million last year.

   Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, which depends heavily on
sales of memory chips, has been hard hit by competition in
those chips, especially from Japanese and Korean makers. The
company's net slid to $14,000 in its second quarter ended
March 1 before rebounding to $1.8 million in its third
quarter.
   Net income for the year ended Aug. 30 was $4.9 million, or
13 cents a share, compared with $106.1 million, or $2.85 a
share a year earlier. Sales were down to $333.3 million from
$446.4 million last year.
   Micron's stock closed at $7.375, down 37.5 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading. The announcements were
made after the close of trading.
