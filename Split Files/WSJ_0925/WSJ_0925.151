   THE SOVIET PARLIAMENT GAVE Gorbachev major new
presidential powers.
   Following weeks of legislative debate over how to
transform the country's economy, the Soviet leader won the
right to issue decrees in almost every aspect of economic and
social life until early 1992, so as to personally direct the
transition to a market-based economy. Among the areas covered
by his new powers are property, wages, prices, the national
budget, the financial system, and law and order. In addition,
a new committee was set up to devise a compromise economic
program from three proposals by Oct. 15.

years" to retain Kuwait.

vowed that the U.S. won't impose new conditions for lifting
the economic sanctions imposed in 1986 against South Africa.
He also stressed that all political groups in South Africa
have a responsibility to "support the process of peaceful
transition."

with kidnapping and assault in connection with a 1988
incident in which a teen-ager died.
