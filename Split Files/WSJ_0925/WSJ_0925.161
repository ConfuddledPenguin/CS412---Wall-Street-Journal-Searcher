   MOSCOW -- The Soviet parliament, after weeks of debate
over how to transform the nation's beleaguered economy,
handed Mikhail Gorbachev substantial new presidential powers
and postponed a decision on the exact shape of economic
change.
   President Gorbachev won the right to issue decrees in
almost every aspect of economic and social life until March
31, 1992, giving him power to direct the transition to a
market economy. A new committee to be led by Mr. Gorbachev
and comprising economic experts and national and republican
political leaders, is charged with devising by Oct. 15 a
compromise program from three proposals.

   By granting greater powers, the parliament -- unable to
reach its own decision on changes -- effectively shifted
responsibility to Mr. Gorbachev's shoulders. And the
"conciliation committee" averts a confrontation with Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   But the moves could end up causing more problems. "Today
we won a chance to reach a compromise," said Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid Abalkin. But "honestly, I'm not satisfied
because this amounts to marking time. Sooner or later we have
to act."
   The slowing of economic change puts the central government
in conflict with the republics that are making their own
economic changes, in particular the Russian Federation, which
has approved the most radical program for its territory.
   The new presidential powers aroused anger in the 15
republics, which are increasingly restive about independence.
   "All of this is done to protect the government apparatus
as it is," said Nikolai Kutsenko, a Ukrainian representative.
"I can tell you that in the Ukraine we won't let the powers
of this president be greater than our own."
   Russian Federation deputies held an emergency meeting last
night to evaluate the situation, according to Interfax news
agency. The Presidium of the Russian parliament on Saturday
denounced the idea of broader presidential powers, which Mr.
Gorbachev on Friday hinted could include control over
republican governments. Russia called the idea "inadmissible"
and threatened to do whatever was necessary to protect its
own sovereignty.
   The relationship between the republics and the central
government is one of the most pressing problems facing the
Soviet government, and a crucial element in the debate over
economic change. For two weeks, the parliament has wrestled
with three proposals to transfer the nation to a market
economy. The proposals share some elements, but differ on
such key points as whether the republics or the central
government are to hold decisive power, the starting point for
change, and the pace of transformation.
   Parliamentary debate has centered on the economic
nitty-gritty while a political battle raged behind the
scenes. In the media and on the streets, supporters of
radical change demanded the resignation of Mr. Ryzhkov, who
proposes more moderate changes. Mr. Ryzhkov said he would
resign rather than implement a program he disagreed with.
   But by Friday afternoon, economics was no longer the
subject of the debate. Politics had taken over. The question
no longer was whether to have price rises, but who should
have power, and the parliament failed to make its scheduled
choice of one of the economic plans.
   Yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev urged the parliament to "cast
aside political ambition and proceed from reality." In a
series of speeches, he alternated between pleading and
intimidating the representatives into approving his favored
proposals.
   During a recess, Mr. Gorbachev huddled with the authors of
the various plans in an attempt to resolve the deadlock. The
upshot: Stanislav Shatalin, author of the most radical
proposal -- which had seemed to be gaining favor -- returned
to the hall chastened.
   Mr. Shatalin explained to the members why he kept
insisting that they choose his program alone in a short
speech during which he often turned around to address Mr.
Gorbachev, who waved him off.
   By the afternoon, Mr. Gorbachev was calling on the
deputies "not to yield to primitive passions." He asked
directly to be granted the new powers. The proposal was
approved 305 to 41.
   Several proponents of radical change, including Leningrad
Mayor Anatoli Sobchak, tried to add amendments that would
curtail the president's powers, but all were defeated.
   Whether the new powers will amount to anything in practice
remains to be seen. Mr. Gorbachev already has considerable
constitutional power to issue decrees. Yet, few of some 18
decrees he has issued so far have been seriously implemented.
   Supporters of the new powers argue that the lack of change
is the reason additional powers are needed. The institution
of president, in existence here only since February, has few
supporting structures in place. "The president hasn't been
the real main figure," said Fyodr Burlatsky, editor of the
liberal weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta. "This is only a step in
the institutionalization of presidential power."
   But some republican representatives worry that
presidential powers without U.S.-style checks and balances
could lead to a dangerous monopoly of control. "We need
strong power but we need it on the level of republics," said
Yuri Kakn, an Estonian representative. "I fear this
{presidential power} because it could become a dictatorship."
   Political analysts say the key to resolving both the
questions of power and economic change will be to find a
consensus between the republics and the center. If such a
consensus isn't reached quickly, writes Stepan Kiselyev in
the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, any economic program "risks
remaining in history as no more than a literary monument to
the epoch of the disintegration of the empire."
