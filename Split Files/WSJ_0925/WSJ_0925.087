   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America is expected to
announce today a joint venture with a Japanese partner that
will substantially improve the company's presence in the
lucrative but unpenetrated Asian market.
   Specific details were not available, and Alcoa declined
comment. However, a spokesman for Kobe Steel Ltd.'s New York
office confirmed that Kobe had been negotiating with Alcoa.
Kobe is a leading Japanese maker of can sheet and other
fabricated aluminum.

   Experts say a venture will most likely be for a large
rolling mill, perhaps for automotive applications. A rolling
operation could also give Alcoa a presence in the growing
Japanese aerospace and can industries.
   Aluminum analyst Peter Merner said he expects Alcoa to
make a "significant investment in processing," which would be
the first such investment for Alcoa on a large scale outside
Europe and North America.
   The potential benefit of such a venture for Alcoa, which
has been exporting heavily to Japan, is clear. "The Japanese
container industry is very inefficient, and Japanese rolling
mills are nothing to write home about," said Robin G. Adams,
president of Resource Strategies Inc., a consulting firm.
   For Alcoa, this would be the first in a series of planned
ventures in Asia, Europe and South America. Alcoa Chairman
Paul O'Neill has said he is willing to go where the business
is -- and with soft domestic demand for aluminum in the
automotive and construction industries -- that increasingly
means Europe and Asia. In Japan, auto makers have ambitious
plans to increase aluminum usage in automobiles.
   Alcoa already has joint ventures with Japanese companies
Kasei Ltd. and Moralco Ltd. to make alumina chemicals, and
with Shibazaki Seisakusho Ltd. to make closure mechanisms.
The company has also been competing with Pechiney Corp. of
France to develop products for the Japanese aerospace
industry.
