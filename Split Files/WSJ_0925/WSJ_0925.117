   The mutual fund industry, Wall Street and corporate
America are unhappy with a Securities and Exchange Commission
plan to restrict what the nation's $450 billion of
money-market funds can hold.
   The argument centers on an SEC proposal that, in an effort
to make the funds supersafe, would limit fund holdings of
less than top-grade debt to 5% of the total. Furthermore,
debt by a single issuer could make up no more than 1% of a
fund's holdings. The restrictions would prevent the money
funds from buying as much corporate commercial paper as they
do now.

   Current rules allow the funds -- considered by most
investors to be tantamount to bank accounts -- to hold any
amount of debt rated in the top two categories with
maturities of less than one year. There are a few other
caveats, but money funds typically have loaded up with the
paper to boost yields.
   The SEC proposal came on the heels of defaults by several
large issuers of commercial paper, which are short-term notes
issued by companies and underwritten by Wall Street firms.
The comment period for the proposal is to expire today, and
the SEC is expected to vote on the measure in the next few
months.
   But the plan appears to annoy just about everybody.
Corporate America, the big issuers of commercial paper, is
concerned that the cost of raising money will jump after a
large buyer of the paper is restricted in its moves.
Currently, commercial paper accounts for about 52% of the
money invested in taxable money-market mutual funds,
according to the Donoghue Organization, a money-fund research
and information firm based in Holliston, Mass. The firm
doesn't track how many funds are holding less than
top-quality paper.
   Time Warner Inc., in a comment letter, said it would be
directly affected by the proposal. "Companies such as Time
Warner Inc. would be unfairly penalized with a loss of a
valuable liquidity source and higher rates on our available
liquidity," the company wrote.
   Similar comments came in from MCI Communications Corp.,
Marriott Corp. and Chrysler Financial Corp.
   Wall Street wasn't tickled either. Representatives of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. met
with SEC commissioners and staffers to express concern that
the agency would be hurting the commercial paper market, an
SEC official said. Goldman Sachs declined to comment and
Shearson officials couldn't be reached.
   But the mutual fund industry trade group has a different
objection to the SEC's plan -- it thinks the measure is too
lenient. In its comment letter to the SEC, the Investment
Company Institute said that "past experience indicates that
(securities other than top-rated) may undergo rapid quality
deterioration and therefore may involve risks inappropriate
for funds seeking to maintain a stable net asset value."
   Instead, the ICI proposes allowing funds to include a
higher percentage (10%) of "split paper" -- that is
commercial paper that has received the top rating from one
agency and a lower rating from another. "This proposal would
allow money market funds to continue to have a fairly high
level of flexibility while significantly reducing risk,"
wrote Matthew Fink, the group's general counsel.
   Acting director Gene Gohlke of the SEC's investment
management group said he wasn't sure what the commission
might do to resolve the differences between the two camps.
   But the decision is likely to affect some funds greatly.
Milwaukee-based Strong-Corneliuson Capital Management Inc.,
whose $818 million money-market fund is 67% in commercial
paper rated less than top grade, says it isn't taking a
position on the plan.
   Vanguard Group, a Valley Forge, Pa., mutual fund,
generally supported the SEC proposal. "We're all for
tightening up the rules a bit and taking a conservative
stance to protect shareholders' principal," said Jeremy
Duffield, a senior vice president.
   T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. thinks the SEC proposal goes
too far on credit quality. "We want to be able to buy A2-P2
paper, though not right now," said Theodore Wiese, executive
vice president of the Prime Reserve Fund. "We pay credit
analysts a lot of money, we think they add some value."
