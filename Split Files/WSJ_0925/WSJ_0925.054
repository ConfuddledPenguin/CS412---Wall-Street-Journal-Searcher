   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Bank of Commerce Bhd.,
controlled by Malaysia's dominant political party, announced
a proposed takeover and subsequent partial merger with United
Asian Bank Bhd.
   Bank of Commerce said Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin
approved the complex arrangement with UAB, which was taken
over in 1987 by Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank.

   The transaction would create the fifth-largest locally
incorporated domestic bank in terms of shareholder funds,
amounting to 210.6 million Malaysian dollars (US$78 million),
and the sixth-largest in terms of assets (M$6.8 billion) and
deposits (M$3.9 billion).
   The arrangement effectively would make Bank of Commerce an
investment holding company, among whose primary assets would
be the sharply enlarged domestic banking operations under
UAB.
