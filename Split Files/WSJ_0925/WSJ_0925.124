   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department filed a civil rights
lawsuit against Maryland and its lottery agency, charging
that a state minority-hiring program discriminated against
white men.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleged
that the lottery agency violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964
by refusing to consider white male applicants for four jobs.
Maryland officials couldn't be reached to comment.

   The Justice Department didn't specify in its filing what
type of jobs were covered by the minority-hiring program. The
complaint accused Maryland of "refusing to hire on the basis
of their race and sex qualified white males."
   The department said in its suit that the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission "found reasonable cause to
believe the charge was true," attempted unsuccessfully to
reach a settlement, and finally referred the matter to the
Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.
