   Tomorrow the U.S. Census Bureau will release its annual
report on poverty in the U.S. The report will claim that
there are some 31 million to 32 million poor Americans, more
than in 1965 when the War on Poverty began. Evidence is
mounting, however, that the Census Bureau's poverty report
dramatically understates the living standards of low-income
Americans, and dramatically overstates the extent of true
poverty.
   The Census Bureau counts as "poor" anyone with "cash
income" less than the official poverty threshold of $12,675
(for a family of four in 1989). But the bureau seriously
undercounts the income of the poor. In fact, the bureau's own
data show that low-income households spend $1.94 for every $1
in "income" they report. And the gap between spending and
income continues to grow larger each year. Something
obviously is amiss.

   That something is the way the government calculates
income. A key shortcoming in the Census data is that they
disregard assets entirely. Middle-class families that have
suffered a temporary dip in earnings are defined as poor even
if they own a house and have other substantial assets. A
second shortcoming is that the Census ignores almost the
entire welfare system when calculating the "income" of the
poor.
   The non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS),
part of the Library of Congress, shows that -- in constant
dollars -- federal, state and local spending on
"means-tested" programs for low income Americans, rose from
$154 billion in 1980 to an all-time high of $173 billion in
1988, the last year for which comprehensive data are
available. An additional $11 billion in Medicare spending on
poor persons, which was not included in the CRS total, raised
total U.S. welfare spending to around $184 billion in 1988.
   These dollar amounts tell only part of the story. There is
also a large conceptual gap between the "poor" as defined by
Census and what most Americans consider "living in poverty."
   According to the Census Bureau's own data, there are some
22,000 "poor" households that own heated swimming pools or
Jacuzzis. Thirty-eight percent of the persons whom the Census
Bureau identifies as poor own their own homes; 62% of poor
households own a car; 14% own two or more cars. Nearly half
of all poor households have air-conditioning; and 31% have
microwave ovens.
   Without intending to trivialize the misfortune of those
who are truly poor, it's important to note that most "poor"
Americans today are far better housed, better fed and own
more property than was the average U.S. citizen throughout
most of this century.
   In 1988, for example, after adjusting for inflation, the
per-capita expenditures of the lowest income fifth of U.S.
households exceeded the per-capita income of the median
American household in 1955. The average "poor" American lives
in a larger house or apartment than does the average -- not
average non-poor, but average period -- West European. Poor
Americans eat far more meat, are more likely to own cars and
dishwashers and are more likely to have basic modern
amenities such as indoor toilets than is the general West
European population.
   So what do the numbers mean? The Census Bureau informs us
that in 1988 there were 33.3 million people with incomes
below the official poverty line before receiving welfare
benefits. After receipt of welfare, the number of poor
persons dropped to 31.9 million. In other words, according to
Census, $184 billion in welfare spending reduced the number
of "poor" persons by only 1.4 million, a cost of $131,750 per
person.
   This remarkable record is achieved because the Census
disregards the effect of non-cash welfare benefits in
calculating poverty. According to the Census, entire
programs, such as food stamps, public housing, Medicaid,
low-income energy assistance and the Women, Infants and
Children food-assistance program might as well not exist. Of
$184 billion in welfare spending, Census counts only $27
billion as income for poor persons. The missing welfare
spending excluded from the Census poverty reports comes to
$157 billion, or more than $11,000 per poor household.
   An accurate survey of the income, assets, and welfare
benefits of Americans would show far fewer poor people. This
should not lead us, however, to declare victory in the "War
on Poverty."
   Most American adults living today had a parent or
grandparent who was "poor" by current government standards,
when adjusted for inflation. Yet the behavior of these
individuals from earlier generations was middle class, as
were the values they transmitted to their children.
   Many of today's poor are trapped in a "behavioral poverty"
that is far crueler and more pernicious than the material
poverty experienced by earlier generations. The explosion of
welfare spending in the past 25 years has created entire
communities where work is rare, intact families unknown and
dependence on government a way of life passed on from
generation to generation. Individuals who were intended to be
the beneficiaries of the welfare state are instead its
victims.
   Everyone should be justifiably concerned about persons
living in material poverty through no fault of their own. But
the current poverty reports tells us little about real
poverty in the U.S. And by focusing attention solely on
material living standards it distracts attention from the far
more serious issue of "behavioral poverty."
   This is a problem that can't be fixed without a thorough
understanding of the nature and extent of poverty in America
-- a picture the Census Bureau report only blurs.
