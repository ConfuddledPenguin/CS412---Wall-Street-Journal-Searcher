   Philadelphia Electric Co. said it expects to take a
one-time charge of $249 million, or 70 cents a share, against
third-quarter earnings to reflect the cost of an early
retirement program.
   The utility said that 1,909 of its 11,273 employees, or
73% of those eligible, decided to take early retirement under
the plan, announced this summer.
