   In some editions of your Sept. 10 issue, in a story about
Affiliated Publications Inc., a Boston Phoenix media critic
was quoted. It should be noted that he is paid to bash the
Boston Globe and does his job well.
   We would simply like to present our side to the critic's
assessment about the Globe lacking luster by pointing to the
record:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One day before the article appeared, the Globe added an
investment subsection and expanded its overall Business
section; expanded its Real Estate section, and added baseball
writer Peter Gammons to its roster.
   One week before, the Globe opened a bureau in Berlin, only
a few months after opening a bureau in Moscow. A week before
that, we introduced a special Movie section. This month,
we'll start our fifth zoned section in 30 months, and next
month we'll begin a special Music section.
   Meanwhile, our latest circulation is up 11,000 daily and
12,500 on Sunday over last year.
   If that's lacking in luster -- in a New England recession,
no less -- then we're guilty as charged.
