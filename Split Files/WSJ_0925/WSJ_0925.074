   The American Library Association is upset that Upper
Pittsgrove Township, N.J., objects to Webster's definition of
intercourse and that Laytonville, Calif., doesn't like the
way Dr. Seuss depicts loggers. Well, in a world in which
we've all been taught to be sensitive to any slight or
offense, no one should be surprised that the "other side"
would join the game.
