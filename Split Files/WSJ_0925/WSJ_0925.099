   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the credit
rating on about $1.8 billion of senior debt issued by
Northern States Power Co., citing restrictive state
regulation of the Minneapolis utility.
   The rating service said that the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission's decision last month to deny a $120.8
million rate increase to Northern States will "constrain the
company's future financial performance." The company was also
ordered to refund a related interim rate increase that took
effect in January.

   Chief financial officer James Doudiet said the downgrading
was expected and "consistent with the evaluations of other
agencies." The utility has petitioned the state regulator to
reconsider its decision. In its request for a rehearing, the
utility asked that it be granted a transitional rate increase
to cover identifiable cost increases.
   In denying the rate increase, the Minnesota commission
said Northern States's "overall budgeting process is
seriously deficient in accuracy and credibility."
