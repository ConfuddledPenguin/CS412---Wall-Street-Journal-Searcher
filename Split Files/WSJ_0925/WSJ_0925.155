   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it
will lower the price of calls to Canada from the U.S. under
its "Reach Out World" plan by 10%, beginning Oct. 5.
   The company said the reduction is pending regulatory

first 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the price will be reduced
an additional 5%. The plan applies to calls made between 5
p.m. and 8 a.m. each weekday and all weekend.
