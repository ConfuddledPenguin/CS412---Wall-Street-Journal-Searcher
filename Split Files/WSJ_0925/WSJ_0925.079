   The Persian Gulf crisis appears to be calling forth
various public-policy hobgoblins from their tombs. If you
look hard enough, you'll see one long-decaying idea wandering
the floor of the U.S. Senate today. This poor thing, last
seen haunting the 1970s, is called CAFE, or corporate fuel
economy standards. The Senators will vote today on a bill
which mandates that new cars achieve a miraculous average of
40 miles per gallon by the year 2000, up from today's 27.5
mpg standard.
   CAFE, of course, has been trouble since 1975, when it was
created by a Congress determined to save energy by all means
except the right one: lifting price controls. CAFE's first
effect was to drop an unintended windfall on Japanese auto
makers.

   As a sop to the labor unions, Congress limited the ability
of U.S. auto makers to meet the CAFE standards for their
fleets by bringing in small cars from their foreign plants.
So with CAFE forcing the U.S. companies to spend billions to
retool domestically, those clever Japanese -- who had always
made small cars -- naturally got to the "energy-conscious"
consumer first.
   CAFE has had other perverse effects. By raising the cost
of large cars as much as $1,200, it has encouraged car owners
to hang on to their older, dirtier cars. As for energy
savings, the Federal Trade Commission estimates that CAFE has
cost nearly $5 for every gallon of gasoline it has saved.
   The CAFE experience also raises some troubling questions
about some of these ideas whose goodness is somehow never
supposed to be questioned. The fact is that in the name of
energy conservation, the fleet of cars on U.S. highways got
smaller, and there is a growing body of evidence that this
downsizing has cost the lives of some people who had
accidents in the smaller cars.
   Even after massive engine redesigns, auto makers have been
able to comply with CAFE only by downsizing cars by some 500
pounds. The relationship between car size and safety is
pretty straightforward. Recent studies by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety show that auto fatalities have
increased as much as 67% because of CAFE. Brookings economist
Robert Crandall concludes that the CAFE-mandated downsizing
of cars is responsible for between 2,200 and 3,900 additional
traffic deaths every year. Mr. Crandall says that raising the
CAFE standard to 40 mpg "would more than double the toll of
the current CAFE level."
   Mandating a 40 mpg standard would force a reduction of at
least 600 pounds in the average car. Harvard Public Health
Professor John Graham says that such a reduction "would be a
setback to automobile safety that is without precedent, more
than wiping out the safety benefits of any single government
regulation in this field."
   This time around, higher CAFE standards are being sold as
a way to counter the potential oil blackmail of Saddam
Hussein. But long after Saddam is gone, they would continue
to hammer an auto industry that can barely keep up with its
competition as it is. We don't doubt that the notion of 40
mpg cars might strike some as a bargain. But why not
legislate 60 mpg or 300 mpg? Or cars that run on sunlight?
   It would not surprise us if the Senate voted for CAFE,
insofar as so many Senators now think that their votes cause
miracles. But CAFE made this promise the last time it
appeared. The problem of fatalities in ever-smaller cars is a
compelling matter. It won't do for the Senate to assume that
someone else out there is going to solve this problem after
they have created it.
