   HANOVER, West Germany -- Continental AG, the West German
tire and rubber products maker, said it rejected Pirelli
S.p.A.'s offer to merge their world-wide tire businesses "in
its present form," but offered to "negotiate over a future
business cooperation."
   Continental, the world's fourth largest tire maker, just
ahead of No. 5 Pirelli, said its management and advisers have
decided that the Italian company's offer, received about 10
days ago, "isn't in the interests of the company, its
employees, its shareholders or its customers."

   Pirelli, a Milan-based industrial group, said last week
that its plan for merging its global tire operations into
Continental would give Pirelli majority ownership of
Continental. Pirelli currently directly owns 5% of
Continental's share capital and says it has partners with
whom it jointly controls 51%. A Pirelli spokesman declined to
comment on the Continental announcement.
   Pirelli's main interests are in cables and tires. The tire
manufacturing operations are housed in its Amsterdam-based
Pirelli Tyre Holding N.V.
   Continental officials said the Pirelli proposal calls for
the German company to acquire the assets and liabilities of
Pirelli Tyre Holding for 1.8 billion to 2.2 billion marks
($1.14 billion to $1.39 billion), with the final price yet to
be determined.
   In explaining its rejection, Continental's chairman, Horst
Urban, said Pirelli's price is well above market levels.
Continental officials said they estimate the market value of
Pirelli's world-wide tire assets at roughly 800 million
marks.
   The proposal calls for Continental to issue new shares to
its current holders to raise the cash to cover roughly 50% of
the price. The other half would be financed through fresh
bank borrowings by Continental.
