   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund's
policy-making panel agreed the agency should promptly lend
more to countries hurt by the Persian Gulf crisis, provided
they are adopting sound economic adjustment policies of their
own.
   But the panel, the so-called interim committee, said the
increased lending can be done through existing lending
mechanisms, and it didn't recommend any specific new fund for
lending to countries hard-pressed by higher oil prices.

   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, who heads the
interim committee, said the panel's agreement "provides a
framework" for the IMF to provide help "on an expedited
basis."
   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus said that the
increased lending would be evident by early next year. But he
added, "We won't put money down the drain. Help will go to
countries with good adjustment policies."
   Messrs. Wilson and Camdessus spoke at a joint news
conference yesterday after the release of the Interim
Committee's statement, which sets out IMF policy for the
coming months. President Bush is scheduled to address the
opening session of the annual meetings of the full IMF and
World Bank here today.
   The interim committee, which normally convenes prior to
the IMF and World Bank's annual and semiannual meetings,
warned that the recent rise in oil prices "may contribute to
cost-price pressures and moderate growth, particularly in oil
importing countries." It cautioned against attempts to
cushion consumers through subsidies, price controls or higher
wages, and advised that oil prices should be passed on
quickly to consumers.
   The interim committee indicated that the IMF will use
several existing lending mechanisms to help countries damaged
by higher energy costs. It will employ its Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility, from which it lends to the
very poorest countries at subsidized interest rates. It also
will increase standby loans and use of its so-called
compensatory and contingency financing facility.
   The IMF committee hasn't given estimates of the additional
lending it will do, but Mr. Camdessus said he expects the
organization's existing resources to be "adequate" at least
until March 1993, assuming the $65 billion capital increase
recently approved by the organization's members is completed
soon.
   While it praised Saudi Arabia, Japan, the European
Community and Japan for pledging to help severely affected
Mideast countries, the IMF's policy-making body still is
looking to some of the Fund's richer members for further
help. It said that it hoped "all members that are in a
position to do so will collaborate" in this assistance. Last
week, the IMF's managing director discussed the likelihood
that the agency might act as an intermediary between oil-rich
countries and those suffering balance-of-payments
difficulties.
   Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs David
Mulford is scheduled to head an international meeting
Wednesday to discuss how to coordinate international plans to
lend between $13 billion and $16 billion to Egypt, Turkey and
probably Jordan, three countries most severely affected by
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The IMF already is producing preliminary estimates of the
damage to the "front-line states." In an internal memorandum,
Jacques de Groote, the IMF's director for Turkey and several
other countries, said the crisis "will cause an annual loss
to Turkey of about $5 billion."
   Mr. de Groote's memo lists measures Turkey has taken since
the crisis. These include big rises in prices for gas and
diesel; higher sales and import taxes; sales of public land
and other revenue-raising efforts. Because of this prompt
action, and with "appropriate" foreign financing, Turkey
"will be able to restore a viable balance of payments
position, reduce inflation, and maintain relatively high real
income growth," Mr. de Groote concludes.
   Despite what Mr. Camdessus called the "mini-oil crisis"
that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the
interim committee -- tracking the statement released Saturday
by the seven major industrialized nations -- said economic
growth is still continuing "albeit at a slower pace."
   It also delivered a strong message calling for completion
of the current round of international trade talks being held
under the world trade treaty, the General Agreement on
Tarriffs and Trade. It said a new accord would strengthen the
world economy and ensure the success of reforms in eastern
Europe and in developing nations.
   Mr. Bush is expected to focus his remarks today on arguing
that there is an urgent need for more progress in the GATT
talks.
