   PHILADELPHIA -- Sitting in the cluttered office he shares
with two other public defenders, Richard Bank thumbs through
current case files stacked on his lap: A burglar accused of
shooting a woman point-blank in the chest. A mother who has
confessed to killing her baby, stuffing it into a trash bag
and burying it in a city park. A habitual car thief accused
of shooting a nine-year-old while joy-riding on a stolen
motorcycle.
   Many of his clients have committed heinous crimes. Most
have several prior convictions -- some more than a dozen
previous arrests. One other thing they have in common: All
have yet to reach age 18.

   "I only get the worst of the worst," says Mr. Bank with a
touch of pride. A balding, bearded man with a baritone voice,
wire-rim glasses and a bow tie, Mr. Bank has volunteered for
this assignment in the juvenile special-defense unit after 17
years as a public defender. In exchange for a lighter
caseload, he and the other three attorneys in the unit take
on the most violent juveniles.
   In these times of family breakdown, child abuse, cocaine
wars and vicious street crime, defending violent youths has
become a poignant and often thankless job. It can drain the
public defender's spirit. Lately, America's justice-system
pendulum has swung sharply away from rehabilitative ideals
and toward harsher punishment. As the stakes for the youths
have risen, so has the toll on the defenders themselves.
   A look at Mr. Bank's caseload shows how he tries to make a
difference. But it also underlines the frustration of working
with juveniles on whom the rest of society has already given
up.
   Mr. Bank, a 48-year-old graduate of Villanova law school,
spent most of his career handling some of Philadelphia's most
grisly adult criminal cases. But in the late 1970s, he
supervised the defender association's juvenile unit. Then, he
says, the juvenile court was truer to its mission.
   Since its inception at the beginning of the century,
America's juvenile-court system has been guided by the notion
that youthful offenders should be treated and rehabilitated,
not punished and stigmatized as criminals. (In most states,
juveniles become adults at age 18; in others, the cutoff age
is 16; a few use 19.)
   Court vocabulary reflects this belief in rehabilitation:
Youths are said to be "adjudicated delinquent" rather than
found guilty. They are "placed" in rehabilitative programs
and "youth development centers" rather than sentenced to
prison.
   But here and in other large U.S. cities, the idea of
emphasizing the child's needs has been overshadowed by less
lofty but more attainable goals: locking up young offenders
and keeping them off the streets as long as possible. "If a
kid shows a nasty, violent streak, forget the rehabilitation,
we're going to go with the punishment," says Philadelphia
District Attorney Ronald Castille. "A kid murdering or raping
is not a kid being a kid."
   Although the number of juveniles arrested over the past
five years here has dropped significantly, the total placed
in corrective institutions has skyrocketed, from 695 in 1984
to a record 2,227 last year. Most of Pennsylvania's juvenile
facilities are full beyond stated capacity.
   Last year, the DA's office also succeeded in certifying a
record number of Philadelphia's juveniles as adults and
transferring their cases to the city's already-swamped
criminal courts. The trend reflects a growing sentiment that
the few "hard-core" juvenile offenders who could be "saved"
don't justify the additional resources being wasted on many
more who seem destined for a life of crime. The cost of
placing a repeat offender in a secure juvenile institution
exceeds $50,000 a year.
   "It's just not worth it to give them another chance," says
James McDermott, chief of the DA's juvenile habitual offender
unit here, one of 13 such units across the country originally
funded by Justice Department grants to prosecute repeat
juvenile offenders more rigorously.
   A decade ago, combat between prosecutors and defenders in
juvenile court was less intense. If a youth had multiple
charges brought against him for a single crime, the defender
would often plead his client guilty on all counts, even if he
could win an acquittal on some, Mr. Bank says. The goal was
to get help for the youth, and the slate would be wiped clean
when he became an adult. Now, Mr. Bank says, that objective
has taken a back seat to resisting prosecutorial efforts to
"pile on" juvenile adjudications for use in later adult
sentencings.
   Most juveniles whose cases fall into Mr. Bank's lap are
kids who have exhausted the resources of the juvenile justice
system and are on the brink of prison. He tries to get them
one more chance.
   Jamall Rickmon, a short, muscular youth, had had plenty of
chances to turn his life around before his latest case was
given to Mr. Bank. Since his first arrest at age eight,
Jamall had spent most of his life in rehabilitative
institutions but still managed to rack up a dozen arrests.
After his latest crimes, at age 17, he was found by a
family-court judge to be "not amenable to treatment" by the
juvenile system and was certified as an adult.
   Jamall had driven a stolen getaway car in a $36,000
jewelry heist. With police tailing him at high speed, he ran
a red light and broadsided a car carrying two college
students. The passenger, a 25-year-old woman, suffered a
fractured neck, a broken pelvis, broken ribs and a severed
ear. The 23-year-old driver suffered two broken legs, a
ruptured neck artery and a severed ear that surgeons later
reattached.
   At the advice of Mr. Bank, Jamall pleaded guilty at his
arraignment, waiving his right to a jury trial and placing
himself at the mercy of Judge Legrome Davis. Moments into
Jamall's sentencing hearing, Mr. Bank found an opening.
   The public defender told the judge that Jamall Rickmon had
had, in fact, only two juvenile felony adjudications since
turning 14, not five as the court-prepared pre-sentencing
report said. That difference could affect the length of
Jamall's sentence. Mr. Bank contended that the other three
offenses really belonged to James Rickmon, who, upon arrest,
often gave police his older brother's name. If granted
another day, Mr. Bank said, he could prove that the court had
erred.
   The next morning Marion Rickmon, Jamall's 71-year-old
grandmother, arrived in Courtroom 738 early and sat in the
second row of chairs, her wrinkled hands folded and clinging
to crumpled Kleenex, her face locked in a pout.
   Mr. Bank wanted to see Jamall get a two- or three-year
sentence at Camp Hill, a county prison with a program in
industrial skills. That way, he said, his client could learn
a trade and how to read. According to his pre-sentencing
report, Jamall couldn't read "even the smallest words."
   Shortly before Judge Davis took the bench, a court officer
handed Mr. Bank Jamall's juvenile file, a two-inch-thick
collection of dog-eared psychological evaluations,
juvenile-institution progress reports and probation-officer
recommendations dating back to his first arrest a decade
earlier. Mr. Bank and his social worker frantically pored
through it, trying to reconstruct the pasts of his client and
15-year-old James.
   By the time Jamall's case was called, about 10 minutes
later, Mr. Bank was able to assert confidently that the list
of his client's prior felony adjudications should show two,
not five. "Fine," Judge Davis said. The judge then asked the
district attorney in the case whether he wanted to dispute
"this one narrow issue." The DA declined.
   Then, Jamall took what public defenders call a "heavy
hit." Ignoring the state sentencing guidelines around which
Mr. Bank had constructed his arguments, Judge Davis sentenced
Jamall to 30 years in the state penitentiary. He will be
eligible for parole in a decade.
   "I'll be dead before you get out," Mrs. Rickmon whispered
to her grandson.
   "There goes Jamall Rickmon," said an exasperated Mr. Bank
as he left the courtroom. Sure, he felt bad for the victims
in the other car, he said, but this sentence wouldn't help
them. It was typical of the "primal urge of exacting revenge"
that dominates the courts today, Mr. Bank contended. Mr. Bank
sees Jamall Rickmon himself as a victim, a "brain-damaged kid
the system had failed." His IQ has been tested at 74, and a
psychologist said he showed signs of brain damage.
   Jamall never had a family life. He didn't know his
father's name and had never seen him. He and his three
siblings, all by different fathers, were reared by his
grandmother, who lived on welfare. His mother was never
around, he told a social worker. "She not have time for me,"
he said. "Don't know why." Mr. Bank, as a father, expresses
little sympathy for such parents.
   Jamall often skipped school, and he flunked several
grades. In response to a social worker's question this year,
he said he thought George Washington was the current U.S.
president. He is very impressionable. "Prison will be the
college of crime for him," Mr. Bank predicts.
   But the defender usually tries to keep a client from being
certified as an adult so he can get the services provided to
juvenile offenders. Even if the penalty is no stiffer, "as a
pointy-headed liberal, I know he needs more help than the
adult system can give him," Mr. Bank says.
   Much of Mr. Bank's work is driven by values going back to
the beginning of his career, when he was protesting the
Vietnam war and handling cases for the Central Committee of
Conscientious Objectors. Though he concedes the public has a
right to be protected from the behavior of some of his
clients, he feels society is reaping what it has sown. He
decries the deterioration of social programs and says that if
the government provided a guaranteed income to its poor, many
of his young clients wouldn't resort to selling drugs.
   "My clients are dyssocialized," he says. "They don't know
what's expected of them. They've never met anybody who wakes
up with an alarm clock every morning."
   Many have fathers in prison and mothers on drugs, or have
been abused. One client was in a child-pornography film.
Another, at age three, was taught by his father to fire a
machine gun. And most, though only 16 or 17 years old, have
fathered children.
   At Jamall's sentencing, his 16-year-old girlfriend and
their year-old baby are present. During a recess in the
courtroom, Jamall Jr., wearing a diaper, gym shorts and a
Bart Simpson tank top, runs to the bench where his father
sits. Jamall cradles his son between his knees -- his hands
are cuffed behind his back -- leans forward and tries to make
eye contact with him.
   Fifteen minutes later, when Jamall is sentenced, his
girlfriend starts sobbing, then screaming, before she and her
baby are led out of the courtroom.
   "I get immune to wailing girlfriends," Mr. Bank says on
the walk back to his office. "If you don't keep your distance
in this job, you just go crazy. You see so much cruelty." Mr.
Banks says he has developed an "aesthetic distance" that
allows him to fight his young clients' legal battles without
becoming emotionally involved in their personal struggles.
   Still, he often offers fatherly advice. He sent a "hot
rodder" magazine to a client named James, a graffiti artist
now in state custody, hoping he would put his artistic skills
to better use: pin-striping cars.
   When Mr. Bank first met James, the youth had already
compiled more than 20 arrests, mostly for burglaries and
escapes from juvenile detention centers. While in one of
them, he engaged in "brief sexual activities" in return for
cigarettes, according to a report from the institution.
Considering James's background, Mr. Bank says, his behavior
isn't surprising: His father frequently beat him up, and his
mother had a history of having sex with young children and
supplying them with drugs, according to a psychological
report on her son. "As a young child, James huddled in the
corner while his mother had group sex," Mr. Bank says with
disgust.
   Back in his office after a "heavy hit" sentencing of a
client certified as an adult, Mr. Bank kicks off his shoes
and slouches in his chair, almost forgetting that he also has
a case in family court that morning. His client, Joseph, is
being considered for discharge after 18 months in an
institution for sexual offenders.
   At age 17, Joseph tried to rape a younger girl on a
downtown street in broad daylight. Prosecutors got him
certified as an adult, but were reversed when the results of
a psychological examination revealed Joseph's background.
   At age three, Joseph saw his mother commit suicide by
jumping from a high-rise building. His father was an
alcoholic whom Joseph rarely met. After the suicide, the
authorities placed Joseph with his mother's paramour, who
abused him "physically, emotionally and sexually," according
to his case file. At seven, Joseph was taken from the
paramour and put in a home with his stepmother and her eight
other children. He often ran away from there, including once
to New York for nearly three weeks when he was 11.
   On arriving at the courtroom, Mr. Bank discovers that the
public defender assigned to the room has already handled his
client's hearing. Joseph has been discharged from the
institution.
   "I'm doing great on the cases I'm not here for," Mr. Bank
says wryly. "I'm like the kiss of death."
