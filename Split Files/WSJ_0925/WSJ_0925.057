   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
accused a 26-year-old New Jersey man of concocting schemes to
manipulate the prices of three stocks.
   In a civil lawsuit, the SEC said that Kevin Weakland,
Ocean City, N.J., used aliases, fabricated press releases and
falsified SEC filings to push up the prices of General Cinema
Corp., Southmark Corp. and Kings Road Entertainment Inc. The
SEC is seeking to permanently enjoin Mr. Weakland from future
violations of securities law, but isn't seeking disgorgement
of any profit, which appears to be about $9,000. The agency
said Mr. Weakland will be representing himself in the case.

   Mr. Weakland, the sole owner of KLW International Inc.,
couldn't be reached for comment because his phone number is
unlisted. The SEC wouldn't release it.
   The scheme alleged by the SEC offers a glimpse at some
unusual ways of moving stock prices. According to the
complaint, Mr. Weakland bought 1,000 General Cinema shares on
May 9, 1988. About five weeks later, he dummied up a false
press release purportedly issued by a large Texas insurance
company and sent it to the movie company's board and an
entertainment trade paper. He sent the release under the
signature of Ralph J. Ackers, which the SEC said is an alias.
   The release said the insurance company had acquired
1,849,000 shares, or about 4% of General Cinema shares, might
buy another two million and wanted two seats on the General
Cinema board, the SEC said. Then Mr. Weakland sent a letter
to General Cinema, signed by another alias, Kile Johnasen,
saying that Johnasen held 6.1% of General Cinema and was
negotiating for a possible joint tender offer for the
company, the agency said.
   Several days later, Mr. Weakland filed a false 13D
disclosure statement with the SEC, telling the agency of the
Johnasen stake, the SEC said. Later that day, the Dow Jones
News Service ran a story about the filing, helping boost the
price of General Cinema shares. The company responded to the
wire item by releasing a statement questioning the
authenticity of the filing, and the Dow Jones wire ran a
story about General Cinema's reaction.
   The stock price, which had jumped on the original
13D-filing story, slipped back, and Mr. Weakland later sold
his shares at a small profit, the SEC said.
   The SEC said Mr. Weakland made false and misleading
statements about his General Cinema holdings and intentions.
   According to the SEC charges regarding Kings Road, after
Mr. Weakland bought 10,000 shares of the Los Angeles-based
company in January 1988, he wrote to the company's chairman
under the alias Joe Tyler.
   One letter to the company said that Mr. Weakland's firm
had started talks to acquire the shares of several large
Kings Road holders in a "swap buy out" of preferred stock for
common stock, the SEC said. After disclosing terms of the
offer, the letter contended that "by way of this offer we
could have over 51% of the stock or at the very least become
a major stock holder," the agency said.
   Two weeks later, Mr. Weakland filed a 13D with the
commission stating that KLW owned 254,500 shares, or 5% of
Kings Road stock. The filing listed the contact as "Joe Tyler
c/o KLW International Inc." and included Mr. Weakland's home
address and telephone number. Mr. Weakland's position was
eventually sold. The SEC complaint argued that he made false
and misleading statements.
