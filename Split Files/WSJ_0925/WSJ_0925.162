economic data.

trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell
339.05 points to 23438.78.

   Although volume in London looked healthier, traders said
that the increase mainly reflected activity in second-line,
or "beta," stocks that inflated figures in the main market.
   The U.K. economic figures helped the cash market: The data
showed that the current account narrowed to #1.128 billion
deficit ($2.08 billion), from a revised #1.68 billion deficit
in July and a #2.29 billion deficit in August 1989. But when
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 September futures
contract failed to respond in kind, the underlying market
began to tumble.
   Traders said yesterday was a "locals market" in futures
trading, where dealers were operating on their own behalf,
and institutional investors stayed away.
   Further aggravating the London market, Wall Street opened
down and continued to drift lower for the remainder of the
London session.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index fell 35.2 points to 1990.3. The
day's high of 2018.4 came late morning, after the disclosure
of the economic data. The market is now at its lowest level
since Jan. 26, 1989, when it closed at 1959.8.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index closed down 26.9 points
at 1510.4. Volume was 500.3 million shares, off from 553.7
million shares Friday.
   In the futures markets, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract was trading at 1977, down from Friday's close of
2025.
   Overall volume figures were boosted as much as 180 million
shares by trade in second-liner Mount Charlotte, the property
and hotel group that has received a takeover bid from New
Zealand financier Ron Brierley and his investment group
Brierley Investments Ltd. Brierley said it bought a 10.1%
stake in Mount Charlotte from the Kuwait Investment Office.
Mount Charlotte shares climbed 11 pence to 70 1/2 pence.
   Oil prices continued to climb, while oil-sector share
prices were mixed. Enterprise Oil gained 3 pence to 662
pence, but British Petroleum fell 4 1/2 pence to 364 pence.
Shell, which went ex-dividend, dropped 8 pence to 479 pence.
Traders said the oil sector might have finally reached its
peak.
   Property group Hammerson fell 21 pence to 544 pence
following market rumors that its Dutch owner Rodamco was
disposing of the company to cover cash needs. Rodamco said it
wasn't planning any such disposals, however.
   Cadbury Schweppes, which said it is in talks with a German
mineral water maker, fell 6 pence to 305 pence.
   Prudential Corp., a U.K. insurance group, is selling its
Belgian subsidiary that no longer fits into long-term plans.
The shares closed 5 1/2 pence lower at 194 pence.
   Also in the insurance sector, Commercial Union said its
European division signed a distribution agreement with an
Italian merchant bank. The shares fell 5 pence to 408 pence.
   Also, stocks closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich,
Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Madrid; unchanged in
Milan. South African gold stocks closed higher.
   And shares ended lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei, Manila, and Wellington, and up in Seoul.
