   A researcher who has taken an unorthodox approach to
developing an AIDS vaccine reported early evidence that the
technique could stimulate certain protective "killer" cells
of the immune system.
   Allan L. Goldstein, a biochemist at George Washington
University and the lead author of the report, said the
approach indicates a role in vaccine development for
so-called core proteins, which are found inside the virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

   By contrast, most experimental vaccines have been based on
proteins from the outer envelope of the virus. In either
case, the hope is to use noninfectious protein fragments to
trick the body into mustering an immunological defense
against infection.
   Because envelope proteins vary subtly among different
strains of the virus, researchers are still trying to
determine which protein fragments are both immutable and
capable of inducing a strong defense. Core proteins are less
mutable, but comparatively little investigation has been done
into their defense-inducing capacity.
   The latest work by Mr. Goldstein's team, reported in the
current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, centered on a synthetic peptide, called HGP-30,
that is identical to a portion of a core protein of the AIDS
virus. The HGP-30 vaccine is produced by Viral Technologies
Inc., a joint venture of Cel-Sci Corp., Alexandria, Va., and
Alpha 1 Biomedicals Inc., Washington. Mr. Goldstein is the
founder of Alpha 1.
   The researchers found that blood drawn from nine persons
infected with the AIDS virus contained killer cells that
attacked a laboratory cell line coated with HGP-30. They
concluded that the killer cells, of a type known as CD-8
positive lymphocytes, zeroed in on HGP-30 because those
lymphocytes had been sensitized by the core protein. The
inference is that HGP-30, used as a vaccine, might prompt a
similar response.
   Collaborating with the George Washington group in the
report were researchers from Universite Pierre et Marie
Curie, Paris, and the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
Md.
   In an interview, Mr. Goldstein argued that if a useful
vaccine is ultimately developed, it may incorporate pieces of
both core and envelope proteins. "None of us can say for sure
that any of the approaches being taken will by itself become
an effective vaccine," he said.
   He said a protective response in the body to a core
protein would presumably attack cells infected with the virus
rather than the virus itself. He noted reports that core
proteins show up on the surface of infected cells and thus
could act as targets for killer cells. Within the free virus,
however, core proteins don't present themselves as targets
since they lie under the viral envelope.
   Mr. Goldstein added that researchers in London have found
higher counts of CD-8 positive lymphocytes in four persons
inoculated with HGP-30 during safety trials. None of the four
is infected with the AIDS virus. Three others haven't shown
higher counts, but they received lower doses of HGP-30.
   The location of the human trials of HGP-30 in London is
one indication of the slowness with which the core-protein
approach has been tried in the U.S. The George Washington
group has yet to win approval for human trials from the Food
and Drug Administration, though safety trials of HGP-30 in
people are scheduled to begin in California this fall under
the auspices of a state program that doesn't require FDA
clearance.
   Dani P. Bolognesi, an AIDS vaccine researcher at Duke
University, cautioned that most experimental evidence to date
"screams for envelope" protein fragments as a constituent of
an AIDS vaccine. But, he said, "that doesn't mean you
couldn't add core {protein} to the vaccine and do better," if
more evidence in favor of core proteins develops.
   Core proteins are attracting somewhat wider interest. This
month, for example, MicroGeneSys Inc. said it is beginning
human safety trials of a vaccine based on a core protein,
though not the one on which HGP-30 is based. MicroGeneSys, a
closely held West Haven, Conn., company, already is testing
in people a vaccine based on an envelope protein. The company
says that researchers plan eventually to test core and
envelope proteins in combination.
