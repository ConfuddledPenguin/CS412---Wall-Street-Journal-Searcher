   Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries PLC of Edinburgh, Scotland,
a brewing and leisure concern, said it raised its stake in
the Dutch leisure concern Center Parcs N.V. to 80% of the
ordinary shares outstanding.
   The two companies said last week that they were in talks
that could lead to Scottish &amp; Newcastle's buying all the
Center Parcs shares that it didn't already own.

   The purchases last Friday involved 747,146, or 5.2%, of
Center Parcs's ordinary shares, and 39.1% of its 5.75%
sterling convertible subordinated bonds and 4.2% of its 3.75%
guilder convertible subordinated bonds. Scottish &amp; Newcastle
said its holding of all classes of Center Parcs securities
now stands at 70%, up from 60.3%. The price paid for the
additional stake wasn't disclosed. Last Thursday, the
companies said Scottish &amp; Newcastle would pay about #180
million ($332.3 million) to acquire the balance of Center
Parcs.
   Though the initial terms of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's
friendly stake last year included a three-year standstill
pact, Center Parcs said last week that it would benefit from
being a Scottish &amp; Newcastle unit.
