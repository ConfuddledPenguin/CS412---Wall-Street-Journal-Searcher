   Qume Corp.'s stock fell 60% yesterday after the company
said it was advised that an investor group may terminate its
planned acquisition of Qume if conditions aren't met by
Sunday.
   Qume closed at $2.75, down $4.125, in national
over-the-counter trading.

   The Milpitas, Calif., computer-equipment maker in June
agreed to be acquired for $86 million by a group led by Qume
Chairman David S. Lee and Wearne Brothers Ltd. of Singapore.
One condition for the merger, Qume said, was that the Taiwan
Stock Exchange Index not decline 50% or more between the time
of the merger agreement and the deal's closing. Such a
decline has occurred, Qume said.
   The company said it will hold a stockholders meeting
Thursday and, if the merger is approved, will prepare to
close the deal so that the acquisition can occur if the
Taiwan stock market recovers sufficiently.
   Qume also said it expects to report a loss of about $1.5
million for the quarter ended Aug. 31 on revenue of about $53
million.
