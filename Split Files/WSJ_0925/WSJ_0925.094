   PITTSBURGH -- Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. Inc. said it will
soon package its film in paper canisters, replacing the
plastic containers now in use. Fuji also said most of its
film will be made from recycled paper.
   Fuji, which is the U.S. marketing unit of Fuji Photo Film
Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, said the new packaging will apply only to
its 35mm film sold in the U.S. The company said the new
canisters, to be made of "moisture-proof" paper developed by
Fuji, are more environmentally sound than plastic.
Environmentalists say plastics create waste-disposal
problems.
