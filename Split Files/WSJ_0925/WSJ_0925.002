   Your Aug. 24 article "Good News for Worms: Study Finds
Genetic Clue to Aging in Nematode" notes that the recent
successful mutating of a single gene in the roundworm,
"Caenorhabditis elegans," creates "what might be called the
Methuselahs of the annelid world." May I point out that
annelids, which are segmented worms (earthworms, etc.) belong
to an entirely different phylum than the roundworms, which
are nematodes. The nematodes are a giant step below on the
evolutionary ladder from the annelids.
