   Delta Air Lines warned that financial results for the
fiscal first quarter will be "significantly worse" than last
year's record earnings.
   In a brief statement issued by the chief financial
officer, Thomas R. Roeck Jr., the Atlanta airline blamed the
dim outlook on soaring jet fuel prices, which have spiked up
sharply in recent days above the already sizable increase
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August.

   Mr. Roeck said the airline is paying 64% more for jet fuel
than it was July 31, or 94 cents a gallon compared with 57
cents. A 5.3% fare increase on Aug. 30 didn't have much of an
effect on revenue in the quarter ending Sunday, Mr. Roeck
said. The airline is set to boost prices a further 4.2% on
Monday.
   Delta's year-earlier quarter, however, would be hard to
beat even without runaway fuel prices and the specter of a
nationwide recession. The airline was propelled to record net
income of $133.1 million, on revenue of $2.17 billion, by the
virtual grounding of rival Eastern Airlines, which also has
an Atlanta hub.
   For almost all of the year-ago quarter, Delta had a near
lock on traffic both in and from Atlanta and much of the
Southeast, while Eastern struggled to rebuild operations.
Eastern is nearly back to the complement of flights it had
before the March 1989 strike.
   A Delta spokesman said the earnings outlook wouldn't
affect the airline's ambitious fleet-expansion program or
result in cut-backs or layoffs. One of the nation's most
financially conservative companies, Delta hasn't furloughed
permanent employees since the 1940s.
   Delta isn't alone in the pessimistic view. Two weeks ago,
AMR Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Robert L.
Crandall, painted a similarly bleak picture for the American
Airlines unit. Mr. Crandall told analysts that he expected to
cut 1,000 jobs at the company through attrition; the company
currently has about 90,000 employees.
   Airline experts say that every one cent-a-gallon increase
adds $160 million to the industry's annual expenses. At that
rate, the industry is expecting a deficit of as much as $1
billion this year.
   Already, other airlines are taking steps to limit the
damage. Pan Am Corp. this past week said it would cut 8.6% of
its work force and slash 1991 capacity by 7.5% and switch to
smaller, fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-310 jets from
Boeing Co.'s gas-guzzling 747s on several trans-Atlantic
routes.
