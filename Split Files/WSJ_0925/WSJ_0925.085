   BankAmerica Corp. will join forces with London's Barclays
PLC in an assault on American Express Co.'s grip on the
lucrative traveler's check business.
   The two companies hope the merger will capitalize on
banks' reluctance to sell checks bearing the name of a
competing bank or financial institution -- such as American
Express. And the new operation's combined size could give it
a boost. "It's our intent to challenge for leadership in the
traveler's check business," said Gordon DeLang, senior vice
president of BankAmerica's BA Checque Corp.

   But American Express, although its share has slipped, has
long been the dominant player in the market, and many
analysts doubt that the new combination will have much effect
on it. Estimates of American Express's share of the
world-wide market range from 39% to close to 50%. In
addition, American Express checks carry a cachet with
consumers that other companies haven't been able to match.
   American Express issued $24.1 billion in traveler's checks
last year. Mr. DeLang wouldn't disclose BankAmerica's or
Barclay's check sales, but said he expected the Interpayment
venture to do more than $12 billion in sales in 1991.
   BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, said it agreed to
acquire an equity position in Barclays's Interpayment
Services Ltd. unit and to fold its traveler's check
operations into the company, which will then issue both
banks' traveler's checks. Moreover, Interpayment Services
will provide clearing services for other banks who decide to
issue traveler's checks under their own names. The venture
also will issue checks under the brands of BankAmerica, Visa
and MasterCard.
   The deal also could benefit from banks' concerns about
selling American Express checks when they sell Visa or
MasterCard credit cards, said Spencer Nilson, publisher of
Nilson Report, a newsletter on the credit and traveler's
check industry. "The banks don't want (to work with) a
competitor to their credit cards," he said.
   The venture, said Mr. Nilson and other analysts, is a sign
of the times for the traveler's check industry, where profits
are being squeezed as consumers begin to use automated teller
machines as substitutes. World-wide traveler's check sales
will increase about 7% percent this year, to $58.5 billion,
Mr. Nilson said.
   "The business is still profitable but less profitable and
it's growing slower," said Mr. Nilson. "There's going to have
to be more consolidation -- more of this kind of thing."
   By joining forces with Barclays, BankAmerica taps into
Barclays strength in markets such as the U.K. and Canada.
While Bank of America issues only U.S. dollar checks,
Interpayment issues checks in the currencies of countries
such as Great Britain, Germany and France and has reciprocal
agreements with issuers of checks in Australian, New Zealand
and Italian currencies.
   Barclays, the world's largest issuer of Visa checks, will
benefit from BankAmerica's strength in Europe and Asia and
will gain access to BankAmerica's service organization. The
Interpayment joint venture will move its headquarters to New
York from London, Mr. DeLang said. The banks expect to
complete the venture in the fourth quarter of 1990, pending
regulatory approval, he said.
   American Express executives expressed confidence yesterday
that the joint agreement between BankAmerica and Barclays
won't have a significant impact on its traveler's check
revenue.
   According to Michael Goldstein, a senior research analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York, American Express
will earn about $120 million in pretax profits this year from
its traveler's check operations, about the same amount it did
in 1989.
   "This is a slow growth business, but as interest rates
rise, it becomes more interesting because of the float," said
Mr. Goldstein. The float -- the period during which the
checks remain uncashed and the issuer has use of the money --
accounts for much of the profits American Express earns from
traveler's checks. "The same thing happened in the early
1980s, when interest rates were high," said Mr. Goldstein.
   Mr. Goldstein noted that many of the opportunist companies
that leaped into the traveler's check industry have since
closed or merged their operations. "I don't think this newest
development is going to hurt American Express in any
measurable way," he said. "American Express has a strong
brand franchise with adequate distribution. It has weathered
challenges in the past, and will probably do so again now."
   Mr. Nilson, the newsletter editor, said consumers aren't
likely to shift check-buying habits because of such mergers.
"It isn't going to change the consumer's perception," he
said.
