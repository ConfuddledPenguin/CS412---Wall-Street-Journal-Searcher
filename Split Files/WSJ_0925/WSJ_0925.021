   A House Government Operations subcommittee will hold a
hearing today to examine how the Air Force, Boeing Co. and
Northrop Corp. may have manipulated testing of the
nuclear-tipped cruise missile to cover up problems with the
weapon.
   "There is a big question mark hanging out there, and when
we talk about a nuclear warhead, there shouldn't be any,"
said Rep. Christopher Shays (R., Conn.), a member of the
panel on legislation and national security.

   Memos and reports written by Boeing managers indicate Air
Force officials knew a fluid within the missile's guidance
unit could freeze and cause its gyroscopes to malfunction if
tests were conducted at the required military standard of
minus-65 degrees Fahrenheit. The documents -- obtained by
this newspaper independent of the subcommittee -- show the
tests were redesigned, evidently to assure passage.
   Specifically, according to a Boeing memo dated July 20,
1988, technicians from Warner Robbins Air Force Base began
their analyses as soon as the ambient air in the testing
chamber hit minus 65, leaving the component itself 15 to 20
degrees warmer.
   Recounting earlier test results, Boeing executive Gary
Henn wrote in a June 2, 1988, telephone record: "After normal
cold soak to -65 F stabilization, waited an additional 45
minutes and gyros just barely passed test; waited an
additional 15 minutes and gyros failed test." After an hour
more, "all gyros were frozen."
   As The Wall Street Journal has previously reported, the
fluid in the unit, a Dow Corning product known as DC-200,
gets thicker as it gets colder, eventually rendering the
gyros immobile. In one newly disclosed February 1988 memo,
Boeing manager Joe Moore said Northrop figured "the gyro
would not operate if the {transmitter} was exposed to -65 for
one or two hours," and that Northrop warned "not to go below
-40 F" for an extended span.
   Boeing, Northrop and Air Force papers were collected by
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in a criminal
inquiry that resulted in Northrop's guilty plea earlier this
year to charges of falsifying test results on the cruise
missile, as well as on another Pentagon contract. The file
was recently opened to Herbert Hafif, a California attorney
pursuing a civil case against Northrop on behalf of several
company whistle-blowers.
   The new memos further undercut assertions by the Pentagon
and contractors that the fleet of 1,715 air-launched cruise
missiles is reliable in a real-world operating environment.
In battle, a cruise-missile-carrying bomber could be airborne
for hours, exposing the weapons to temperatures of minus-65
or lower.
   The Air Force -- which, along with Northrop and Boeing,
didn't respond to questions about the specifics in this story
-- is quick to maintain that "there has never been a
real-world flight test failure related to" a navigational
unit, formally known as a flight-data transmitter. One April
1988 briefing prepared for the Strategic Air Command,
however, shows that missiles ready to be launched on three
occasions failed because of low-temperature problems with the
device. Another printout labeled "Master ALCM Flight Test"
also shows numerous missions "aborted for weather . . ."
between 1979 and 1988.
   Further, in a May 1988 memo, Northrop manager D.A. Ross
noted that while "the air temperature at 40,000 feet is -65 F
on a standard day," Boeing chief program engineer "Chuck
Hilsinger commented that we could . . . stipulate that the
test be done at 30,000 feet," where the temperatures are
warmer. Another time, Mr. Ross wrote: "Boeing is aware of the
{transmitter} sensitivity to -65 F and plans both to propose
a higher temp and to specify a detailed procedure as regards
to cool down rates, stabilization time, etc."
   Among those scheduled to testify today is Ronald Deady, a
retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, who told this newspaper
in June that from the earliest stages of the program "the
testing has been, at best, suspect." Also set to appear
before the subcommittee is Howard Hyde, a former Northrop
engineer serving a one-year prison sentence for his role in
falsifying tests on a contract for the AV-8B Harrier jet.
Northrop declined to appear, saying it didn't have enough
time to prepare for the hearing. It was unclear if a Boeing
representative would testify.
