   DETROIT -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it won't be able to
sustain the market-share gains it has made in the U.S. so far
this year because it's running short of cars to sell.
   The Japanese auto maker expects to wind up 1990 with about
8.8% of the U.S. car market, said Robert McCurry, who heads
Toyota's sales and marketing operations in the U.S. That's
down from the 9.2% share that Toyota took in the first eight
months of the year, though it's still a substantial increase
from Toyota's 7.3% share in 1989.

   Mr. McCurry said Toyota currently has only a 14-day U.S.
supply of its best-selling models: the Camry, Corolla and
Tercel. That is substantially below the 60-day to 65-day
supply considered optimal in the auto industry. An adequate
supply of the three models is crucial to Toyota since
together they account for roughly 75% of the company's sales
in the U.S.
   "Market share growth will be very difficult because of our
low supply" of cars, Mr. McCurry said. He added that Toyota's
share of the U.S. car market will be about 9% in 1991.
   Toyota officials sidestepped questions about whether
they're deliberately slowing their sales to avoid possible
political repercussions in the U.S. Japanese car makers, as a
group, got a record 34% of U.S. car sales last month. While
that hasn't sparked a backlash, Toyota officials privately
acknowledge they're concerned about publicity over Japanese
companies buying U.S. real estate and other assets.
   In August, thanks to heavy price incentives, Toyota had
its best sales month ever in the U.S. It sold nearly 97,000
cars, outselling Chrysler Corp. by about 31,000 cars.
Toyota's market share surged to a record 12% for the month,
and for the first time, the Toyota Camry beat out the Honda
Accord as the best-selling car in the U.S.
   Toyota also yesterday unveiled a new, larger version of
its entry-level car, the subcompact Tercel, and said the base
price will be $6,488, unchanged from a year ago. The company
said it's adding a four-door version to the Tercel lineup,
and put its base price at $7,898. Toyota said it expects to
sell 130,000 to 140,000 of the new Tercels next year.
   The Tercel is aimed at attracting buyers who flocked to
Hyundai Motor Co.'s cars in the mid-1980s. Now, Hyundai's
U.S. sales have cooled considerably, and Toyota sees a
marketing opportunity. "We want to capture young buyers and
keep them in the Toyota family," said John Koenig, the auto
maker's U.S. product planning manager.
