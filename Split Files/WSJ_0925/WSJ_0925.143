   WASHINGTON -- Trade Representative Carla Hills warned that
the current negotiations on a new set of global trade accords
could collapse if the U.S. and its trading partners can't
agree on how to handle agricultural subsidies and other
issues.
   Mrs. Hills told the House Energy and Commerce Committee
that the European Community's continued refusal to accept
broader cuts in farm subsidies will place the talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "in jeopardy." The EC
has offered to reduce some of its domestic farm-support
programs but has resisted U.S. demands to scale down import
barriers and export subsidies.

   Mrs. Hills also said that the latest attempt to draft a
GATT consensus for limiting nonagricultural subsidies falls
short of what the U.S. is seeking. And another proposed
accord on lowering barriers to investment flows is bogged
down because some developing countries want to limit foreign
ownership of major industries and to require foreign
investors to export a portion of their production so that the
countries can obtain dollars, Mrs. Hills reported.
   Mrs. Hills also acknowledged a lack of progress in
negotiating an accord on trade in services like
telecommunications, transportation and financing. The U.S.
already has presented 40 proposals for such an agreement, but
so far other GATT members haven't responded, she said.
   The U.S. was the original proponent of a services accord,
but it hurt its own cause by withdrawing coastal shipping and
civilian aviation from the negotiations at the request of the
U.S. industries. U.S. telecommunications companies, moreover,
have objected to including basic carrier services in the GATT
talks and opening the U.S. market to further foreign
competition while many European governments still retain
monopolies.
   The GATT is in the final leg of a four-year effort to
draft new rules covering services, investments, patents and
copyrights, textiles and other trade matters.
   Rep. John Dingell (D. Mich.), chairman of the House panel,
expressed strong doubt about the prospects for a
well-balanced accord. "The negotiating posture of our trading
partners is so unbending and unfair across the board that the
best outcome for the U.S. may be no new agreement at all," he
said.
   The U.S.-EC stalemate over farm subsidies has been evident
for some time, but Mrs. Hills said the part of the talks
dealing with agriculture are at a "crucial stage," with all
GATT members required to submit their final proposals by Oct.
15.
   "Agriculture is the top -- and, in some instances, the
only -- priority for many agricultural exporting nations,"
she said. "Without fundamental agricultural reform, they will
simply walk out."
   Mrs. Hill's tough rhetoric evidently was intended to put
more pressure on GATT members. She said there has been some
progress in the talks, which cover 15 separate areas. She
also reported evidence of increasing flexibility on the part
of India, which used to be an adamant foe of many U.S. trade
initiatives.
   There still could be time for a broad consensus by early
December, when trade ministers of nearly 100 GATT member
countries are scheduled to meet in Brussels to review results
of the talks. Mrs. Hills warned, however, that the U.S.
"won't unilaterally disarm," or abandon its positions, in
order to obtain an agreement.
