   MONTREAL -- The Stone-Consolidated unit of Stone Container
Corp. said it will raise newsprint prices in the U.S. and
Canada about 5% on Jan. 1, setting the stage for the second
industrywide price boost in seven months.
   Newspaper publishers, mired in an advertising slump,
greeted the announcement with dismay. Publishers and analysts
said they expect other major newsprint producers to follow
Stone's lead, and many said a price increase will probably
stick, at least temporarily, because of labor strife at
newsprint mills in eastern Canada.

   Stone-Consolidated, Montreal, said it advised customers
that it will raise its eastern U.S. list price for newsprint
by $35 a metric ton, or 5.1%, to $720. A metric ton is equal
to about 2,204.62 pounds. Stone-Consolidated, which markets
all of Chicago-based Stone Container's newsprint production,
announced similar increases for other markets.
   Newsprint consumers aren't in a good position to fight an
increase, because strikes at several mills in eastern Canada
have shut down about 15% of North American newsprint
capacity. Stone-Consolidated's mills aren't on strike.
   "I think there's a good chance that, because of labor
problems, {the increase} will stick in the short term," said
H. Mason Sizemore, president of Seattle Times Co. Homer
Taylor, vice president, supply, at Miami-based Knight-Ridder
Inc., said that the planned price increase "is pretty
brazen," and that "it's going to be an interesting battle"
between publishers and newsprint makers to see whether the
boost goes through.
   A Stone-Consolidated executive denied the company is
trying to take advantage of the strikes to push through an
increase. Citing higher costs and the effects of discounting,
Stone-Consolidated told its customers that the price increase
"is needed to improve unacceptable profit margins."
   Stone-Consolidated said that even after the increase,
newsprint transaction prices, or actual selling prices after
discounts, will still be below 1988 levels. A
Stone-Consolidated executive declined to say what discounts
the company is offering its customers. But people in the
industry said standard discounts from list price now range
from 15% to 18%.
   With advertising revenues flat or heading lower, newspaper
publishers were already unhappy with the June increase that
pushed the eastern U.S. list price of newsprint to $685 a
metric ton from $650. Newsprint accounts for 20% to 30% of a
newspaper's costs, according to analysts and publishers.
   "The newspaper business is very, very bad this year, and
it's going to get worse," said John Morton, an analyst at
Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. "According to our calculations, it isn't
going to get better until mid-1991, if then."
