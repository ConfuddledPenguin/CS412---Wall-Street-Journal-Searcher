   LONDON -- The exiled Kuwaiti government, in its first
confirmed sale of shares since the Iraqi invasion, sold a
stake valued at about #60 million ($110.8 million) in British
hotel chain Mount Charlotte Investments PLC to a company
controlled by New Zealand's Sir Ron Brierley.
   The Kuwaiti transaction raised Sir Ron's stake in
Britain's second-biggest hotel operator to 39.9% from 29.8%,
triggering a London Stock Exchange rule requiring that an
investor launch a public tender offer after his stake passes
30%. The New Zealand industrialist promptly launched a #386.6
million bid for the remaining 60.1% of Mount Charlotte shares
outstanding.

   Mount Charlotte's board rejected the Brierley bid.
   The sale by the Kuwait Investment Office, the main manager
of the Kuwaiti government-in-exile's $100 billion investment
portfolio, isn't part of a campaign to raise cash, a KIO
spokeswoman said. In the past decade, London-based KIO has
become known as a frequent buyer and seller of stocks. The
Mount Charlotte sale "is in line with our everyday investment
policy and doesn't spark off a spate of (KIO) selling," the
KIO spokeswoman said.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, London stock
traders have had occasional jitters at the thought that the
Kuwaitis might have to raise cash quickly. But at a news
conference here Friday, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the
Kuwaiti finance minister, indicated his government won't be
selling gold or stocks.
   Instead, he said the $5 billion that the Kuwaitis have
pledged for 1990 alone to support the West's Persian Gulf
operations will come from "liquid assets," cash reserves and
sales of short-term market instruments "in various
currencies." He said about half the money has been raised.
   But he indicated that financial pressures on the Kuwaitis
will continue. Kuwait has a bill of $50 million to $100
million a month for support of its exiled citizens. And
military and economic aid to the West and moderate Arab
nations will continue over the next year or two, he added.
   "I'm not worried about 1990. I worry more about 1991 and
1992," Sheik Ali said. He added that Kuwait is prepared to
contribute to such future aid, but would prefer to see it
done through the International Monetary Fund or other world
bodies, and without the normal obligations that the IMF
requires of a receiving country.
   The KIO declined to discuss details of the Mount Charlotte
sale. But Stuart Mitchell, managing director of a London
subsidiary of Brierley Investments Ltd., said a KIO broker,
Hoare Govett Ltd., initiated the sale talks. The per-share
price for the 88.8 million-share parcel, a 10.1% stake, was
"marginally less" than 73 pence, Mr. Mitchell said. The
Brierley Investments bid for the remaining 60.1% of Mount
Charlotte that it doesn't already own is 73 pence a share.
   Mount Charlotte climbed 11 pence to 70 1/2 pence
yesterday.
   London financial analysts speculated that the Brierley bid
was a formality forced by the stock exchange bid rules,
rather than a serious attempt to buy 100% of the company.
When asked about that speculation, Mr. Mitchell said: "Quite
simply, we made the offer because we are required to under
the City code. We'll be quite relaxed about any level of
acceptance that we get." The City of London is the London
financial community.
