   Chrysler Corp. is recalling 106,000 of its 1987 cars to
reduce excessive carbon-monoxide exhaust, the Environmental
Protection Agency said.
   The affected models are the Plymouth Caravelle and
Reliant; Dodge Aries, Daytona, 600 and Lancer; Chrysler New
Yorker, LeBaron, LeBaron GTS and Town and Country Wagon. All
have 2.5-liter, fuel-injected engines.

<TEXT>
   Cars emit excessive amounts of carbon monoxide in their
exhaust as a result of incomplete fuel combustion. Too much
carbon monoxide in the air reduces the amount of available
oxygen, a situation particularly harmful to people with lung
disease or anemia.
   Chrysler agreed to the recall after the EPA discovered the
problem during testing. The company is notifying only car
owners who haven't already had their fuel injectors replaced
under warranty.
