   NEW YORK -- For some big investors in the stock of Chase
Manhattan Corp. the good old days were a week before last
when the giant bank holding company assured them the dividend
was safe.
   It wasn't. On Friday, breaking a hallowed tradition among
New York City money-center banks, Chase sharply cut its
dividend. For the third quarter, shareholders will receive
only 30 cents a share instead of the usual payout of 62
cents. The action stemmed from Chase's decision to set aside
in the current quarter more than $650 million as additional
reserves against potential losses on domestic loans, mostly
in real estate. The company also decided to reduce its staff
by 5,000 employees.

   Chase's decision to cut the dividend came only last
Tuesday, after new projections on the performance of the
banking company's loan portfolio. Richard Boyle, a Chase vice
chairman and the bank's senior credit officer, laid out the
case for the $650 million reserve at a meeting with the
company's highest executives in the early afternoon on the
17th floor at Chase Manhattan Plaza near Wall Street.
   Chase's decisions seem to presage additional bad news --
but not disaster -- for the nation's banking system.
Increases in loan-loss reserves by other banks were seen
probable in light of Chase's.
   "This will certainly pave the way for other banks to get
aggressive with real estate by the end of the year," said
James McDermott, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods,
a New York investment banking firm. He and others noted that
regulators would welcome dividend cuts, and are not only
concerned about falling real estate prices but also are
urging banks to strengthen their capital structure. One
analyst said he would not be surprised to see another money
center bank cut its dividend by year's end and two or three
do so next year.
   Securities analysts and shareholders were surprised by the
size of Chase's retrenchment. Both the increase in reserves
and the reduction in staff were twice what had been expected.
Chase's stock, already trading at only a third of its 52-week
high, fell by $1 a share to close at $12.75 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Share prices on other big New
York banks also fell. The group as a whole lost about $1
billion, or about 5%, of its market value, in Friday's
trading.
   Other banks also shrank their dividend payouts Friday or
may do so in coming months. Midlantic Banks, one of New
Jersey's largest, cut its dividend; Southeast Bancorp, a
Florida giant, eliminated its dividend entirely. Analysts
expect the Bank of Boston to reduce or eliminate the dividend
Thursday; the bank declined to comment. Some other banks in
the Northeast and an increasing number in the Southeast are
considered candidates for dividend cuts and increases in
loan-loss reserves.
   Tempted by huge fees and fat interest rates, commercial
banks in the 1980s aggressively increased their lending on
commercial real estate. Now they are paying the price as the
real-estate market deteriorates in one state after another.
   "This reflects the kind of time we are in," said Arthur F.
Ryan, the driving force, Chase insiders say, behind the tough
action. He will become president and chief operating officer
and Thomas G. Labrecque will become chairman and chief
executive officer next month. Willard C. Butcher, now chief
executive, is retiring a year ahead of schedule.
   As for the New York money-center banks, Chase isn't the
weakest, according to a banking executive who said he was
told so last Friday morning by a top official at the New York
Federal Reserve Bank. The Fed official was said to be
surprised that it was Chase and not another bank getting so
much negative attention in the stock market. He didn't name
the other bank or cite his criteria for weakness, the banking
executive said.
   Securities analysts say they are hardpressed to figure out
which, if any, of the big New York banks might need more
attention. They say exclusive of Third World debt, Chemical
Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover
already have loan-loss reserves as high, as a percentage of
assets, as Chase's new level. Moreover, both banks have
reduced their staffs by thousands in the past few years,
while Chase is only now adopting such belt-tightening in
earnest.
   A $700 million increase in Citicorp's loan-loss reserves
would raise its level to Chase's 1.8% of assets. But Citibank
hardly seems a candidate for such a large increase because of
its conservatism. It has customarily written off problem
loans earlier than other New York banks. Hence its remaining
loans seem "cleaner," in banking parlance, and less likely to
sour.
   For now, Citicorp believes its level of caution is about
right. "No one around here is talking about a dividend cut,"
said Michael A. Callen, group executive in charge of
Citibank's wholesale banking division for the U.S. and the
rest of the developed world. He added: "I don't think we will
have change in the pattern of reserving and write-offs that's
in place; I think we've got a hold on it."
   A Comptroller of the Currency examination of Citibank's
loans is under way. Mr. McDermott said he anticipates no
surprises, "though that risk is present." A number of banks
in the Northeast have been forced to increase reserves after
examiners found loans they considered risky.
   Rather than take a big one-time hit like Chase is taking,
Citicorp is spreading the adjustments to its books over time.
Reserves and write-offs in the first two quarters were
increased at the rate of about $600 million a year, a trend
Mr. Callen sees continuing because, he said, "I don't think
1990 will see the end of this."
   To reflect the downturn in the corporate banking business,
his division began "right-sizing," as he put it, two months
ago. That, he said, is aimed at reducing the division's $2.5
billion annual expense budget by $250 million to $300 million
a year. Mr. Callen said he could not estimate how many of the
15,000 jobs on the payroll would be eliminated.
   After Friday's stock-price decline of 87.5 cents a share
to $15.75, Citicorp's shares yield more than 11%, not as
lofty as Chemical's 16% yield or Manufacturers Hanover's
14.26%. Higher yields are considered less secure. "A number
of the New York banks are trading down as if investors expect
the dividends to be cut," said Thomas Hanley, an analyst for
Salomon Brothers. Chase shares, which had been yielding more
than 17%, will yield 9.41% at the new dividend rate based on
Friday's closing stock price.
   Executives of other banks were quick to point to the
differences between their institutions and Chase. John
McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover, said his
bank has one-fifth the real estate exposure of Chase. "We
sure as heck don't see anything down the road to change the
dividend," he said. "It's hard for me to figure why our stock
is getting hammered." His bank declared its normal dividend
last week.
   Loans to finance highly leveraged corporate transactions
could explain the market's concern. Investors fear these
loans will create big new problems. Bankers Trust New York
Corp. also has a large exposure in that sector. But investors
may be overconcerned. Bank lenders usually take precedence
even over bondholders in corporate defaults, and are even
better protected by collateral than they are in real estate
lending. "It would take an Apocalypse Now to burn into that
{protection}" said Mr. McDermott.
   Even so far as real estate is concerned, to assume that
all big banks are in the same boat as Chase involves "a
danger in extrapolating," said J. Carter Bacot, chairman of
The Bank of New York Corp. Its dividend yield is 10.34%, and
Mr. Bacot said the dividend is "well-covered" by earnings.
Chase's wasn't, because of large additions to reserves over
much of the past year.
   At Chicago's Continental Illinois Bank &amp; Trust Co., with
fewer than half the 13,000 employees it had in 1984 when it
went bankrupt, Thomas Theobald, chairman, said staff cutbacks
like Chase's will become more widespread in banking because
of overcapacity. In the second quarter his bank announced a
12% cut in payroll to 5,700 employees. As for the need to cut
Continental's dividend, now at a rate yielding 11.27%, he
said, "We have no reason to believe that's a necesssity."
Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust Co., New York,
said he felt his bank's reserves were "adequate, and I don't
see anything wrong with our dividend, which we declared last
week." Thanks to record profit in the first half, Bankers
Trust's stock has held up better than most banks and now
yields a relatively modest 6.8%.
   For Chase Manhattan, Friday's lengthy news announcement
was humbling. Besides cutting the dividend, the bank is
shrinking its presence in world banking, a presence that set
former Chase chairman David Rockefeller as an international
banking figure and which Mr. Butcher remained loyal to beyond
its economic justification. Citibank now remains the only
U.S. bank committed to global banking on a large scale.
   Roughly 1,600 of Chase's 5,000-person payroll cut will
come from overseas, mainly Brazil, and from converting
full-service branches in Europe to representative offices. Of
the other staff cuts, 1,600 people in the U.S., mostly New
York, opted for voluntary retirement and left last week. The
remaining 1,800 cuts also will be in the U.S., again mostly
New York, where employees will be let go or be part of a sold
division. Prior to the reduction, Chase had 41,000 employees.
   Despite the cutbacks, Chase remains a U.S. powerhouse. It
also keeps a foot, at least, in nearly every major city in
the developed world. And most important, analysts say, it
isn't a critically troubled bank. If anything, its ability to
take such a big hit and still declare its capital ratios in
compliance with 1992 standards is a sign of underlying
strength, they say.
   "The rumor-mongering can stop now," Mr. McDermott said of
speculation about the depth of Chase's problems over the past
week or so. Though Wall Street was taken aback by Chase's
news, Mr. Hanley said he "applauds" it. "If they had come in
directly in line with expectations there might have been more
credence that it would get worse soon," he said.
   Rodgin Cohen, whose banking law practice for Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell keeps him intimate with bank finances, said, "It is
inconceivable to me that Chase would become another
Continental," referring to that bank's 1984 problems. Chase's
asset mix is much less risky and its funding base is "much
deeper and broader," he said.
   Indeed, the lion's share of Chase's $80 billion in funding
needs are met by retail banking customers, a group
Continental sorely lacked at the height of its problems.
Moreover, other sources of Chase funds -- money market funds,
other banks and corporations with spare cash -- showed no
evidence of cold feet in the hours following Friday's
announcement.
   Helping to bolster confidence was the prediction by
Chase's new management team, which takes over in October,
that the fourth quarter would show a profit of at least $140
million. In contrast, the third quarter will show a pretax
loss of about $625 million, Chase said, as a result of the
loan provision and a $350 million expense for the staff
reduction and other restructuring.
   By taking such a large dose of medicine at once, Chase
also positions itself to strengthen its capital in future
quarters. It said that in the fourth quarter it will set
aside between $170 million and $200 million, lower than each
of the first two quarters of this year. "That will build up
equity capital quickly," said Frank DeSantis, of PaineWebber.
Chase said that after posting its financial figures,
tier-one, or equity, capital will be just above the 4% of
risk-adjusted assets called for under the 1992 international
standard.
   Chase has about $4.2 billion in equity now. Cutting the
dividend will save more than $25 million per quarter. The
restructuring and staff reductions are aimed at increasing
profits by saving $300 million in expenses annually.
   Chase also said it might sell assets in addition to the
sale of its Frankfurt, West Germany, office building, which
netted a third-quarter gain of $117 million. Other analysts
see Chase selling its leasing operation, which has 1,000
employees and more than $2 billion in assets, and selling
loan assets as securities, to raise capital levels.
   The big if, for Chase and the banking system as a whole,
is how far and fast the real estate decline will go. For now,
analysts say, Chase has put its portfolio of loans under the
microscope and adequately reserved for the foreseeable
future. The wild card is what the portfolio might look like
two, three or four quarters from now.
   Even after the shock wears off of Friday's news, investors
are likely to be wary of Chase's stock. "This is a company
that has a big surprise annually," said one analyst. Another
noted that Chase officials had talked glowingly of 1990
earnings on an investor road-show last fall to sell $600
million of stock. They also promised expense reductions that
didn't materialize in the first half and infuriated many of
the buyers of the new stock issue by diluting the stock
further through a new dividend reinvestment plan, he said.
   "Investor credibility is very low for Chase. It will take
a while coming back," said Mr. McDermott.
   Mr. Boyle and his group had spent last Monday and the
weekend immediately preceding it totaling and double-checking
Chase's loan portfolio, including nearly $10 billion in
commercial real estate loans. A U.S. Comptroller's
examination had already been the determining factor in a $225
million loan-loss reserve in the quarter ended June 30. Since
then, "There was no question that there was further
deterioration in Northeast real estate, including the New
York metropolitan area," said Mr. Ryan. In its news release,
Chase said it would write off $65 million in commercial real
estate loans in the third quarter, up from $15 million and
$21 million, respectively, in the first two quarters.
   "We looked into the foreseeable future and took every
significant project on a low, medium and high likelihood of
whether we were going to lose money and how much," Mr. Boyle
said. In the end it was a "judgment call," he added,
especially since nailing down a property's fair-market value
for accounting purposes is elusive in the current market.
   A team led by Mr. Ryan was giving much the same scrutiny
to each of Chase's business operations and finding where to
make staff cuts. The 15-person group had met weekly for the
past several months, with small subsets getting together
nightly while dining on pizzas and the like.
