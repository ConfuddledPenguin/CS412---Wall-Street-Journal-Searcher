   OTTAWA -- Canada has decided to join the U.S. and Mexico
in proposed free-trade negotiations, raising the prospect of
a hemispheric free-trade zone of 360 million people.
   The proposed negotiations are expected to build on the
free-trade agreement that took effect last year and provides
for the gradual removal of trade barriers between the U.S.
and Canada.

   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said yesterday that
the U.S. and Mexico had agreed to Canadian participation in
the talks, which are expected to start next spring. The U.S.
government needs congressional authorization to negotiate
such an agreement.
   Canadian and U.S. trade analysts predict that the
negotiations will be difficult because of the big gap in
living standards between Mexico, on the one hand, and the
U.S. and Canada on the other. "This will be a very
challenging negotiation and an enormous breakthrough if an
agreement is reached," said Robert Hormats, vice president at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and a former U.S. assistant secretary of
state.
   The U.S. and Canada conduct more bilateral trade than any
other pair of nations, a total of $173 billion in 1989.
Mexico is the U.S.'s third-largest trade partner after Canada
and Japan. In 1989, Mexican-U.S. trade exceeded $51 billion.
Canada's trade with Mexico was a modest $2.5 billion in 1989.
   The Royal Bank of Canada said that because of big
differences in technology and labor costs, a
Mexico-Canada-U.S. trade agreement probably would need a
"substantially longer" transition period than was provided
for in the U.S.-Canada pact. Under that agreement, tariffs
between the two nations are to be eliminated by 1998.
   Some U.S. and Mexican officials have privately expressed
concern that Canadian participation in the negotiations will
slow them down, considering that some issues, such as the
status of migrant Mexican laborers, are of little direct
concern to Canada. Mr. Crosbie, however, said Canada assured
the U.S. and Mexico that there would be "no delay as a result
of our involvement."
   Gordon Ritchie, a trade consultant who was Canada's deputy
chief negotiator on the U.S.-Canadian trade pact, said the
price for direct Canadian participation in the Mexico-U.S.
negotiations "may be unacceptably high, given the modest
economic benefits to be gained." He also said Washington may
be seeking objectives in the talks with Mexico that it didn't
achieve in the U.S.-Canada agreement, such as guarantees
against subsidized trade.
   But major Canadian business organizations have urged the
government to participate in the U.S.-Mexican negotiations.
"It is in Canada's interest to pursue" a three-nation accord
to build on the U.S.-Canada trade pact, the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce said.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked the U.S.
late last month to open the trade talks.
