   NASIELSK, Poland -- As the Poles shucked off communism
last year, meat disappeared from the shops and grain stopped
flowing into the silos. Solidarity's nervous new governors
shouted for help, and an ecstatic West responded. Food came
pouring in by the shipload.
   Politically, the aid gave comforting proof that the West
was on Poland's side. Economically, viewed with a year's
hindsight, it has contributed as well to a grain glut, a
storage crisis, an export barrier -- and to the first
compromise of principle by the free-marketeers trying to
steer their nation toward capitalism.

   Poland's economic managers had sworn to kick the subsidy
habit that did the communists in. But as prices ran free and
demand turned to dust, surpluses soon swamped a market
already swelling with $570 million of Western wheat, butter,
cheese, beef and pork. The state's mills and dairies, their
sales shot, began to go broke, and to drag the whole food
economy with them.
   This summer, the economists had to relent and save
Poland's rickety old food processors with subsidies.
   "The new government didn't understand agriculture," says
Gregory Vaut, an American who does. "The West had no
independent assessments. They trusted the government and sent
in the food."
   Mr. Vaut, who runs a two-year-old agency called the
Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture, was
here to watch the aid stream in. Only this summer did other
Westerners schooled in generosity's dangers arrive to inspect
the damage. "Poland didn't need it," says one.
   Aleksander Zareba already knew that. He grows wheat, oats
and rye on 300 acres near this village in Poland's
midsection. For acreage, he stands out among the 15 million
Poles who live off the land. For anger, he's lost in the
crowd.
   "We are impoverished compared with last year," he says, in
the chill of his farmhouse sitting room. His harvest is in.
"Poland isn't threatened with hunger. It's threatened by a
lack of sales. It's embarrassing for our government; they
extended their hand for grain. But our best way out is to
export. Some countries in the world do need food."
   Neither the politicians nor the economists imagined a year
ago that democracy would hand farmers such a raw deal. After
resisting collectivization for 40 years, agriculture had the
biggest reserve of private entrepreneurs in a nation betting
its future on private enterprise. And it was the farmers,
withholding grain last year, who helped carry Solidarity to
power.
   But that was an economic act, meant to drive prices up,
not a political one to bring communism down. As aid rushed in
to fill the food gap and Solidarity freed the market, farmers
got no solace.
   Prices of everything they need, from seeds to screws,
multiplied 20 times in a year of speeding inflation. Retail
food prices did much the same. Yet the farmers lost out:
Prices for their produce at the farm gate rose just 40%.
   "Consumers paid too much and farmers got too little," says
Mr. Vaut, the U.S. expert. "In the middle was the state-owned
food-processing machine."
   And it was breaking down. Still monopolies, they reacted
in character. Suppliers jacked up prices while processors
bought low from farmers and sold high to everyone else.
   Poles literally tightened their belts and began to eat
less protein. Unsold milk, butter and cheese clotted the
dairies, which couldn't afford credit and ran out of cash. So
farmers slaughtered cows, creating a meat glut. Some dotty
bureaucrat compounded it by importing 213,000 tins of Dutch
luncheon meat. And the food aid rolled on in.
   The Soviets, kopekless, quit buying potatoes. Vodka demand
fell as cagey Poles piped Western liquor through a tax
loophole. Outcome: potato glut. Then came sugar beets. Then
grain.
   As wheat sprouted in spring, last year's crop, plus a
donated mountain from the West, still hogged half of Poland's
silos. With their capital in storage, the mills had no money
to buy this year's crop and no place to put it. They
threatened to shut their gates. That's when the farmers bared
their teeth.
   They blocked roads all over the nation in July and
occupied the Agriculture Ministry under the noses of a World
Bank mission. Backed by Rural Solidarity, they demanded
guaranteed minimum prices and soft loans. Only after the
minister resigned (it has taken two months to replace him)
did the government cave in.
   "The budget had to intervene," says Mieczyslaw Stelmach,
who filled in all summer as acting minister. Farmers didn't
get price guarantees. They did get $47 million in loans and
$90 million for an agency to prop up prices. Dairies got $82
million to modernize. And mills got $73 million in soft
credit to keep their gates open. "We had to put out fires
with subsidies," Mr. Stelmach says.
   For the free-marketeers, it was a letdown. "Short-run
concern for keeping farmers off the streets can cloud our
long-term goals," says one of their advisers. But the
International Monetary Fund, bane of the subsidizers, isn't
worried. "Pressure on the Poles is unbearable," a foreign
expert says. "It's hard to stay pure."
   Farmers were content, temporarily, to have mimicked the
outside world in expensive relief for agriculture.
"Intervention is popular everywhere," says Piotr Dabrowski,
Rural Solidarity's spokesman. "It's a canon of contemporary
capitalism." Millers were content, too; for the moment, their
monopoly was safe.
   "We survived some difficult months," says Janusz Fota in
his office at Mill No. 1 in the town of Ciechanow. The sound
of steady grinding floats in from across the courtyard. "If
we didn't get this credit, we couldn't buy grain. Now our
dealings with the bank are good. They don't run much risk,
and it's good for the company."
   But far from perfect. The deputy director's door opens and
the director, Marek Sialkowski, comes in looking troubled
after a tour of his county. "Full warehouses," he says.
   The ability to buy grain hasn't given mills the power to
sell flour; Poles still eat less bread. So the surplus keeps
building. The agricultural monopolies, rotten to their
communist cores, still see no need to change their ways --
and the farmers are growing restive again.
   "The only solution," says Mr. Dabrowski, "is a big
export."
   Unfortunately, the prospect doesn't overjoy Poland's
angels in the West. Most of their aid has stopped showering
down, ending the moral ban against exporting similar stuff,
and the U.S. may rethink a promise to send a further 200,000
tons of feed corn. But with crops good almost everywhere and
the Soviets sidelined, the world's trough is already full.
   The European Community slapped down a Polish attempt in
July to export some cheap butter. With French farmers
hijacking British lamb trucks and blaming Eastern Europe for
low prices, Polish meat hasn't got a chance. And wheat?
   An EC bureaucrat bristles when asked. "This will cause us
problems," she says. "It will cause us to doubt whether we
will send any more food to Poland."
