   Watkins-Johnson Co. said it dismissed 5% of its work force
to compensate for lower growth in the company's
defense-electronics markets.
   The Palo Alto, Calif., concern said it sent layoff notices
yesterday to 150 employees in plants in California, North
Carolina and Maryland. The company said it will absorb the
cost of the move in its operating costs for the quarter
ending Friday.
