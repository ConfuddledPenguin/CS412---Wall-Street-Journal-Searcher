   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is facing
significant new opposition from the House Intelligence and
Appropriations committees over continued funding for U.S.
covert aid to anti-government forces in Afghanistan.
   The deteriorating support was disclosed yesterday in a
closed-door meeting of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, whose bipartisan leadership initially
recommended that no additional aid be provided in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.

   Supporters of the program were able to postpone a final
decision. Separately, however, the full House Intelligence
Committee has already imposed its own restrictions as part of
the fiscal 1991 budget for the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Details of the intelligence-authorization bill, approved
by the panel earlier this month, remain secret. According to
intelligence sources yesterday, the measure provides
approximately $300 million to continue the program near its
current level. But contrary to prior reports, half would be
withheld for six months and be subject to a second vote of
approval by the committee.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee has approved its own
combination of cuts and restrictions on the program, but the
House action may prove more significant as a measure of the
changing mood in Congress.
   Although the same Appropriations subcommittee took the
lead only last year in providing $280 million in new aid for
the Afghan resistance, senior members now are increasingly
concerned about the direction of U.S. policy and the cost of
the prolonged war. During the long Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan, few lawmakers challenged the aid program, but
since Moscow withdrew its troops last year, there has been a
new focus on the internal, tribal divisions in the resistance
itself.
   Within the Appropriations Committee, there has been
mounting concern too about evidence of resistance commanders
participating in or sanctioning narcotics trafficking in the
region. In this regard, findings prepared by the
investigative staff of the committee appears to have had an
impact on the leadership, and according to sources, weakened
the Republican support as well.
   The administration has sought to buy time while pursuing
diplomatic initiatives, but within the State Department there
also is impatience with the resistance. Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd retains immense leverage to
protect some continued funding, but those critical of the
funding now include traditional allies of the powerful West
Virginia Democrat. "The net effect of what the Senate and
House committees have done is a clear signal that the
Intelligence committees are restive," said one intelligence
source. "They are going to come out with some restrictions or
cut."
   Subcommittee Chairman John Murtha (D., Pa.) and
Pennsylvania Rep. Joseph McDade, the ranking Republican,
refused to comment last night. But the deliberations on
Afghanistan came as the panel began drafting an underlying
fiscal 1991 appropriations bill funding both the Pentagon and
intelligence agencies.
   Among other accounts, the panel tentatively approved troop
cuts more than twice the size initially proposed by the
administration but still far smaller than what had previously
been voted by both houses. The decision to restore personnel
represents a response to the current crisis in the Mideast.
The reductions voted by the House subcommittee are in the
range of 77,000 to 80,000 troops -- or nearly 50,000 fewer
than proposed by the House Armed Services Committee.
