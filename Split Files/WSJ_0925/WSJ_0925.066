   When Congress finishes hammering out the new budget deal,
it must turn to the issue of funding institutions that have
historically received a great deal of support from the U.S.
-- the so-called Bretton Woods institutions and the
multilateral development banks, including the newly formed
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The
question is, with so many pressing domestic uses for our
scarce capital, why should we spend money on these
institutions?
   The International Monetary Fund was designed to oversee a
system of essentially fixed exchange rates in a world of
relatively closed national capital markets. Today's world,
however, is one of floating exchange rates and increasingly
open capital markets. The largest proportion of lending by
the World Bank has been to state enterprises and public
sector borrowers in developing countries. High fiscal
spending and loss-making state enterprises increasingly are
being perceived as barriers to development, not aids. So are
the Bretton Woods institutions irrelevant today? Have policy
developments and the financial markets passed them by?

   No. Especially in this time of fiscal difficulties and
strains within the world banking system, these institutions
deserve our support and cooperation.
   With the world facing a growing capital shortage, the
challenge for the multilateral financial institutions is to
help design reform programs and to catalyze private financial
markets. In Latin America, free-market-oriented reforms that
have been spurned in the past are now being embraced.
Following the "lost decade" of the 1980s, key Latin American
countries are painfully adopting more stringent fiscal
controls, privatizing loss-making public corporations and
deregulating domestic markets.
   The process is well advanced in both Mexico and Chile;
Venezuela, and more recently, Brazil and Argentina have made
strides toward reform. These countries are now
re-establishing their access to the private capital markets.
For example, the newly privatized Chilean telephone company
recently raised nearly $100 million on the New York Stock
Exchange to finance construction of a million new telephone
lines in that country.
   Developments in the international bond markets are also
encouraging. Pemex, the Mexican oil company, recently raised
funds in the Eurodollar market to improve production
efficiency of offshore oil operations. It is interesting to
note that this Mexican company raised five-year funds at a
rate of 11 5/8% -- comparable to rates of some large American
industrial companies.
   The goal in Central and Eastern Europe is much the same as
in Latin America -- to expand the access of these countries
to the private credit markets. However, the region's
financial situation is becoming more difficult. The Soviet
Union, which has benefited from higher oil prices, has
recently seen its outstanding debt downgraded. Reflecting
investor concern, Soviet loans are now trading at a deep
discount in the secondary market, with the result that Soviet
loan yields are higher than those for Mexican loans.
   The problems of other former Eastern Bloc countries have
been exacerbated by rising oil prices. The growing economic
difficulties of these countries -- and the shift by Comecon
to convertible currency-based trading -- have raised doubts
about their near-term export earnings. Previously, 40% to 60%
of the exports from these countries went to other centrally
planned economies. Consequently, financial support for their
stabilization efforts and seed money will be critical in
order to attract private investment to these countries.
   The transformation taking place in the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe is one for which there is no
textbook to consult. The tasks include enacting fiscal
reforms, legal reforms, and financial reforms; creating free
markets for labor and goods, defining property rights, and
transferring ownership of thousands of companies from the
state to the private sector. Should these reforms be
immediate and total or phased and partial? What should be
done first?
   The Bretton Woods organizations can give invaluable help
in navigating these uncharted waters. In addition to drawing
on the expertise of their own staffs, these institutions are
organizing technical assistance -- as they have in many
countries in the past -- that will allow Central and Eastern
European official institutions and companies access to
experts from all over the world. The new European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development can make significant
contributions as well. It is fitting and logical that the
Soviet Union is now seeking membership in the IMF and the
World Bank -- a move that would complete the Bretton Woods
founders' vision of creating universal institutions.
   During the past 40 years, the U.S. has spent trillions of
dollars to protect its allies in Europe and Asia from the
threat of Communist expansion. Now that it has the
opportunity to help establish free-market economies in the
formerly Communist states, budgetary constraints threaten to
derail it.
   The Bretton Woods institutions enable their members and
contributors to leverage their efforts several times over. To
allow these institutions to languish because of a temporary
budget deficit would be lunacy. I, for one, would rather have
a tax increase than see my country shirk its responsibility
to the world community.
