   NEW YORK -- In the world of money managers, Sanford C.
Bernstein is considered a class act. But after taking big,
risky bets with its clients' money, Bernstein now is near the
bottom of its class.
   A year ago, the big New York money-management firm, which
runs about $9.5 billion of stock portfolios, was coming off a
winning streak. Then, in typically bold fashion, it gambled
two-thirds or more of clients' money on a rebound of cyclical
companies that are highly dependent on the economy's fortunes
-- raising its stakes massively in financial, technology and
auto stocks.

   But the rebound was delayed and the bets didn't work out.
   In the 12 months through August, Bernstein's stock
portfolios have fallen by 23.4% and were a stunning 18.4
percentage points behind the market, measured by Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index. The carnage is continuing. And
contrary to Bernstein's proud claim that over time it outruns
the pack, over five years it actually is trailing the market.
   "We are willing to make bets," says Lewis Sanders,
Bernstein's president. The 43-year-old executive, in
shirtsleeves and with ruffled hair, added: "If you want to be
in the top 5% of money managers, you have to be willing to be
in the bottom 5%, too."
   But it can be dangerous to bet the ranch on companies that
are especially vulnerable when the economy falters.
Bernstein's performance in recent years looks like a yo-yo.
And the firm will have to rebound fast to get even.
   "They have made some grand strategy bets that have not
worked out," says George Keane, who runs the Common Fund,
which recently pulled an $80 million stock account from
Bernstein.
   Bernstein's biggest, diciest bet in the past year: It
raised its stakes in financial stocks, which then were
demolished by huge industry losses on real-estate loans; now
the banking industry faces more dividend cuts. An awesome 36%
of Bernstein's stock holdings, or about $3.4 billion, consist
of shares such as Security Pacific, Chase Manhattan, Bank of
Boston and Cigna. Its financial holdings in the past year
have lost 35% or more of their value.
   Over time, Bernstein aims to stay three or four percentage
points ahead of the market. But only clients that have been
with the firm for nine or 10 years have seen such results.
   Five years is the timespan that many pension officers look
at when they hire or fire managers. And even before this
year's big setback, Bernstein's stock picks for the five
years through 1989 lagged the market by almost two percentage
points.
   Not good, some pension officers say, for a firm that
charges premium fees equal to 1% of investments, double those
of some top-line managers.
   Yesterday, Mr. Sanders told 300 pension-fund clients at
Bernstein's annual investment conference that Bernstein will
make a comeback. But four disenchanted clients have flown the
coop in the past year, including the Common Fund; others are
restive.
   Bernstein managers "are having a particularly tough time,"
says LeRoy Gilbertson, chief investment officer of the North
Dakota State Investment Board, a Bernstein client. "It's
starting to concern us." Over five years, Bernstein ranks in
the bottom 40% of managers with similar investment styles, he
says; over 12 months, Bernstein is among the bottom 15% or
so.
   Bernstein is a "value investor;" it loads up on stocks
after they get clobbered and seem cheap in light of what
Bernstein analysts think the companies can earn in the
future. Unfortunately, Bernstein analysts in the past year
didn't foresee that banking and computer companies would get
cheaper and cheaper as the economy weakened. And Bernstein
didn't hedge its bets by buying many stocks that might hold
up if bank and computer stocks didn't.
   Such concentrated bets by value investors, says Carmine
Grigoli, a First Boston investment strategist, amount to "a
winner-takes-all style that makes me a bit uncomfortable."
   Some 12% of Bernstein's stock portfolio is in autos; 17%
is in computers. It is saddled with 16.7 million Chrysler
shares bought at 17 that closed at 10 3/8 yesterday; 6.2
million shares of Digital Equipment, 5.8 million of USAir
Group and many other big losers.
   Meanwhile, Bernstein in recent months dumped millions of
shares of Halliburton, Schlumberger and other energy
companies -- just before the Mideast crisis carried them
aloft.
   "My concern is their concentration in financials and that
they have held them and aren't cutting back," says Richard
Gagliardi of Allegheny Power System's pension fund. "When do
you say, `Maybe I made a mistake'?"
   Still, Mr. Gagliardi considers Bernstein an "outstanding"
manager. "We're not going to abandon ship now," he says.
Bernstein lavishes attention on clients and this pays off in
loyalty, consultants say.
   "If we'd understood the magnitude of the real-estate
recession, we'd have bought bank stocks more slowly," says
Bernstein's Mr. Sanders. A hands-on manager, he was familiar
with every Bernstein stock trade he was asked about.
   Bernstein paid 24 for Bank of Boston, which was at 8
yesterday. First Interstate Bancorp, bought at 51, was at 23
3/4.
   Of course, many smart people bought bank stocks too early,
though they weren't generally running pension money. New York
investor Thomas Tisch also has big losses on Bank of Boston,
though Mr. Sanders says he didn't consult the Tisch family on
this investment.
   With some analysts predicting many more troubled months
for banks, there are worries that Bernstein might have to
unload part of its bank holdings of almost $2 billion, though
Mr. Sanders says that's unlikely.
   During the interview, he didn't speak of bank stocks going
down; he said their "value spread" had widened a lot, making
Bernstein's bank investments "among the most compelling
values in the market." Banks are boosting capital, cutting
costs and raising their "earnings power," Mr. Sanders says.
Chrysler will come back, too, he adds. "People are
exaggerating their vulnerability" to foreign competition.
   "A year ago, we were at our peak and ahead of the market
for any timespan you could pick," Mr. Sanders says. "We've
been down before, and we'll be ahead of the pack again." In
the mid-1980s, Bernstein also made a big bet on cyclical
stocks. After enduring two bad years, it roared ahead in 1987
and 1988.
   But now, with $9.5 billion of stocks, "their flexibility
in implementing and changing strategies is somewhat limited,"
says Common Fund's Mr. Keane.
   Bernstein compounded its problems by "averaging down" --
Wall Street jargon for raising stakes in stocks as they
crater. A year ago, Bernstein had fat profits on bank stocks
bought after the October 1987 market crash. It began selling
bank shares, but then the stocks started falling as banks'
real-estate problems surfaced.
   "Bank stocks got cheap again, so we rebuilt our
positions," Mr. Sanders says. Bernstein hedged its risk by
investing in 19 banking companies in different states, he
argues.
   Some big Bernstein clients are philosophical. "Over time,
our experience is that they add value," says Neil Darling of
Chevron's pension fund. "They tend to be a little early" in
taking positions, he adds, "but they spring back."
