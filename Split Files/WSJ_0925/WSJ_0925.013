   CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government persuaded
the ruling Labor Party to approve plans for partly
privatizing state-owned airlines and allowing a
private-enterprise competitor to the government's
telecommunications monopoly.
   A special conference of the Labor Party authorized the
government to sell as much as 100% of Australian Airlines,
one of the nation's two major domestic carriers, and 49% of
Qantas Airways, the international airline.

   The government also plans to sell Aussat Pty., its
satellite-services concern, as the basis on which a private
company can build a competitor to Australian
Telecommunications Corp., the monopoly telephone company,
called Telecom. Telecom is to merge with OTC Ltd., the
government's international telecommunications concern, and
will remain state-owned.
   Labor Party policy had prevented these plans from being
drawn up by the cabinet. The party traditionally has
supported government ownership of some companies.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said the government wants "to
give effect to the authority that has been given to us by the
party as quickly as possible."
   Kim Beazley, Minister for Transport and Communications,
said he hopes the sale of the airlines can be implemented in
the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. "I would
certainly want to conclude it by the end of next calender
year," he said. Mr. Beazley said he hopes Aussat can be sold
as the basis for the new telecommunications company in the
second half of 1991.
