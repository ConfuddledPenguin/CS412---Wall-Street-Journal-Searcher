   Foersaekringsbolaget SPP of Sweden, a big mutual insurer,
said it agreed to raise its voting stake in Gota AB, a
financial services concern, to 48% from 4% in a transaction
valued at 4.6 billion Swedish kronor ($794.4 million).
   The move continues the recently intensified consolidation
of bank ownership in Scandinavia. SPP would be the first
Swedish insurer to wrest a major stake in a bank, as Gota has
securities trading and financial units but its crown jewel is
Gotabanken, Sweden's fourth-biggest bank. The sellers are
Proventus AB, a Swedish investment company that owns 29.8% of
Gota, and Kansallis Osake Pankki, Finland's biggest bank,
which holds a 14.4% voting stake.

   SPP officials said the proposed link with Gota would
provide the distribution clout needed to increase sales of
SPP insurance and investment products. Insurance coverage for
individuals, especially so-called unit-linked policies
recently introduced in Sweden, is expected to become the
fastest growing and most competitive corner of financial
services in coming years.
