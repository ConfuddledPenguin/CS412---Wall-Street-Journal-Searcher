   SAN FRANCISCO -- One way to see how detached the phone
companies are becoming from their copper roots is to survey
the global telecommunications steeplechase. Bell Atlantic is
in New Zealand but not in Bermuda. U.S. West is in Hong Kong
but not in Canada. And California's Bell, the Pacific Telesis
Group, is focused on Europe instead of Mexico.
   The awkwardly commodious executive floor at Pacific
Telesis's headquarters tower here has the look of a company
with weight to throw around. The former Pacific Telephone was
in a position to do so, hostile rate commissioners
notwithstanding. Until recently, big banks were similarly
taken with grandiosity.

   Behind the dark-wood paneling in one corner, however, you
meet a product of the old era who since 1987 has guided this
regional Bell's thrust into competition -- into thin air for
the most part. For PacTel Corp., the less-regulated Telesis
subsidiary that Lee Cox heads, is more than anything else a
wireless-communications company.
   "Most people think of things in decades," says Mr. Cox.
"Here we think of things in centuries. So, if you can say the
20th century was the wired century, where we went all the way
from Alexander Graham Bell to where we are with mobile data,
the next century will be the wireless century.
   "The very unique thing happening in the world right now,
never to happen again probably, is that in Western Europe,
now Eastern Europe, now certain parts of Asia, maybe in the
year 2020 parts of Africa, Latin America and so on, these
wireless franchise licenses are becoming available. Once you
have the license, then you {can} provide any kind of
technology on that piece of the spectrum."
   The Bells battle each other and equally potent foreign
rivals to get those licenses at profitable rates of return.
Cellular-telephone and paging services are big. As yet,
overseas rights account for only about 1% of the Bells'
assets but PacTel is the leader. It has made a few Asian
inroads, mainly in Thailand, but its big reach has been
across the Atlantic.
   In Germany it may have hit the mother lode. It has a 26%
stake in the consortium building a second cellular system
there. Charles Schelke of Smith Barney values it at five
times all of PacTel's other foreign ventures combined. Mr.
Cox calls it "the best opportunity anywhere in the world in
the 1990s."
   Not that it's without challenges. "Parts of Germany will
be hard to do because of the Black Forest and other
topographics to engineer," Mr. Cox notes. "We'll get it done
but it will just be more difficult than some place that's
flat. We put the system in Kuwait that's there now -- I think
it's still there, anyway. That was just the opposite. No
trees to speak of, no deciduous trees particularly, which
create differences in how you tune the system in different
parts of the year. Flat, sand, no bodies of water to reflect
the radio signal." He should have been a travel agent for the
U.S. Army.
   The push for franchises abroad coincides with a sweeping
privatization movement. Mr. Cox ranks Germany, with the
Bundespost now split into three parts and its telecom unit
sold, just behind the U.K. on the liberalization list. "Italy
is probably next," and PacTel is looking into it, Mr. Cox
says. Honorable mentions go to Spain, Portugal and Greece.
   Despite the current economic crisis in eastern Germany, he
says he has "great faith" in its future. Elsewhere in the
former communist bloc, Czechoslovakia is his favorite. Any
prospects in the Soviet Union itself this decade? "Selling
pizza in Red Square, maybe?" he responds. "I'd have to be
sure the current reforms will take hold and grow. Talk about
having a fragile economy]"
   The socialist world is not inviting to this born-again
entrepreneur: "What are the terms they are offering? They'll
all want a telephone infrastructure, because they know that's
a key to a vibrant economy. And they want you to pay for it.
In most cases, they're not willing to give you an equity
interest that matches the equity participation. . . . And
then where do you get your revenue stream? There's not enough
disposable income to give you the kind of rate structure you
need to be successful, so you'd have to underprice your
product and not be profitable for a long period of time till
the economy got good enough to create prices that people
could afford. It's a horrible, vicious circle."
   PacTel also disdains some openings in the West that have
attracted its Bell brothers. It "elected not to participate"
in the selloff of the phone company in New Zealand. In
Australia, Mr. Cox says, the government plans to combine the
local and long-distance services of the state system, after
which "they've offered to create a competitor that would have
as its base a company called Aussat, a long-distance carrier
saddled with $700 million of debt and very little ongoing
revenue. It's not just David against Goliath, it's Pee Wee
Herman vs. Goliath."
   One of the boldest privatization drives may be happening
in Mr. Cox's back yard, in Mexico, but PacTel hasn't bitten.
Shakiness of the current reformist government and its
currency is fretted over.
   In addition to wireless, PacTel Corp. is high on cable
television, which Mr. Cox believes will not soon give ground
to fiber optics in developed cities.
   In the U.K., where it's part of a wireless consortium and
is also permitted to compete in local phone service, PacTel
has 14 cable franchises serving 1.6 million homes. There,
however, it must overcome satellite alternatives as well as a
modest British appetite for, and supply of, program variety.
Across the Irish Sea, the problem is primarily political.
PacTel tried last year to get a cable franchise but Dublin
picked the state phone monopoly.
   Entering the cable market in the U.S. has been no easier.
The regional Bells are blocked from offering programming in
their local service areas, and efforts in Congress to lift
that ban failed this year. But Mr. Cox is aiming for less: He
seeks to bid for cable in other jurisdictions, where he says
no one can justly argue that PacTel has an unfair advantage.
Specifically, he wants to exercise an option in Chicago. He
needs a waiver from Harold Greene, the federal judge who
still lords over the phone companies after the AT&amp;T breakup
in 1984. An appellate court has ordered Judge Greene to
review, using a different economic model, his denial of
applications such as PacTel's in Chicago, and Mr. Cox says
he's confident of approval soon.
   At 49, he has been handed the growth portfolio at Pacific
Telesis. That carries more risk than if he had been elevated
to head Pacific Bell, the company's big utility unit. Mr. Cox
cites seven PacTel units that have been divested in its short
life.
   When he's not echoing consumer confusion over service in
the wake of deregulation, Mr. Cox acknowledges the new
environment is "invigorating." You could argue that with the
Bells now scrambling to best each other for business abroad,
the breakup will prove in the end a boon to the export of
U.S. know-how. If competition is likewise fostered at home,
Americans, too, may be on the receiving end.
