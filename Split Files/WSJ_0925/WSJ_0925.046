   Add another familiar name to the list of management
mavens: Theodor S. Geisel.
   S as in Seuss. As in Dr. Seuss.

   The children's author who put "Green Eggs and Ham" on
practically every kid's breakfast plate is being served up as
recommended fare to grown-up managers. Cynthia Eisenhauer,
for one, urges her staff at the Iowa Department of Employment
Services, where she is director, to savor the wisdom in the
86-year-old author's most recent book, "Oh, the Places You'll
Go]"
   Here is one such morsel:
   You have brains in your head.
   You have feet in your shoes.
   You can steer yourself
   any direction you choose.
   "It's inspirational and encourages people to set high
standards and work to achieve them without being
discouraged," exclaims Ms. Eisenhauer.
   Carolyn B. Elman, executive director of the American
Business Women's Association, agrees. She has been pushing
the book to her group's 100,000 members. Unlike many
how-to-succeed books, she contends, "this book lets you know
everyone fails at some time and that you have to pick
yourself up and just go on." Dr. Seuss's prescription:
   Out there things can happen
   and frequently do
   to people as brainy
   and footsy as you.
   And when things start to happen,
   don't worry. Don't stew.
   Just go right along.
   You'll start happening too.
   Nearly 800,000 copies of the book have been sold since it
was released early this year, reports Random House, which is
marketing it "as a book for anyone starting out on a new
adventure in life," says a spokeswoman. Described on its
jacket as a graduation speech for "out-starting upstarts of
all ages," the book has been on the New York Times fiction
best-seller list for more than 30 weeks.
   Like Grinches, some big-name management gurus are giving
their newest colleague the brushoff. "I haven't gotten to it
yet," says Peter Drucker, who suggests he prefers Shakespeare
to Seuss as a management tool.
   What does Dr. Seuss say about all this? "While I had no
intention of speaking directly to managers when I wrote the
book, I'm pleased when readers get something beyond what I
intended."
