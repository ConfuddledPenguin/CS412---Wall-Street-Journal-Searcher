   NEW YORK -- Investors, stung again by soaring oil prices,
dumped stocks and bonds, pushing the stock market to its
lowest level in more than a year and bond yields to their
highest levels since March 1989.
   "A doom-and-gloom mentality is pervading Wall Street,"
said Leo Grohowski, head of portfolio management at
Marinvest. "People are looking for the next piece of good
news and are coming up with nothing."

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 59.41 points in
moderately active trading to 2452.97, the lowest level since
July 3, 1989, when it closed at 2452.77. Bond prices fell 5/8
of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, and the
yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 9.17%.
   Both markets reacted to the surge in prices of oil and
petroleum products. Oil traders, believing military conflict
in the Mideast is becoming more likely, pushed the November
crude oil futures contract to $38.25 a barrel, up $2.82. The
record is $39.80, set March 29, 1980.
   The sell-off in stocks began overseas; in London, share
prices hit a 20-month low.
   "The realization is building for some money managers that
we are headed for a recession," said Ricky Harrington,
director of investment policy at Marion Bass Securities in
Charlotte, N.C. Even blue-chip stocks, which had been holding
up because they supposedly were "recession resistant," were
hit hard.
   Food manufacturer CPC International fell 2 3/8 to 71 5/8;
Chiquita Brands fell 1 1/4 to 24 1/4, and Quaker Oats fell 1
1/8 to 42 3/8. Baxter International, a health-care company,
dropped 7/8 to 22 7/8.
   Harvey Isen, president of Sun America Asset Management,
said many investors are selling stocks in which they have
some remnant of profit, which is precisely what makes many
big growth issues vulnerable. "Clearly the biggest risk is in
the stocks that have not gone down," he says. "I have been
selling the stocks that I believe to be overvalued-drug
stocks, Philip Morris, Pepsi and Waste Management."
   Paul Ehrlichman, vice president at Brandywine Asset
Management, agrees that bear-market-style profit-taking is
plaguing many popular issues. He said many growth stocks are
going down hard for the first time this year, "for no other
reason than that they've held up" so far.
   The selling pressure on stocks isn't likely to vanish
soon. Mr. Grohowski, of Marinvest, said money managers
generally are still raising their portfolios' cash levels,
which are low for a bear market. As of Friday, all-stock
investment funds were 7.3% in cash, according to Indata,
which tracks 1,200 fund managers. In 1982, the cash level was
about 11%, Indata said, and Mr. Grohowski thinks that level
could be achieved again soon.
   "As we approach the end of the third quarter," he said,
"money managers won't mind showing a bit more cash in their
portfolios. In a bull market, money managers are embarrassed
to show they're 5% in cash. Now with the market getting
killed, a client sees 10% cash and says, `Is that all?'"
   Adding to the bearishness is the lack of convincing buy
signals in many sectors. Consumer growth stocks are still
seen as overvalued, and investors are shunning shares of
companies whose businesses are particularly sensitive to the
economy's health. The financial stocks may look cheap, Mr.
Grohowski said, but investors have a "you-go-first attitude.
They want to see a little momentum" upward before jumping in.
   The money managers who don't already own oil stocks figure
it's too late to buy. Many of them think oil supplies will
prove to be adequate and prices won't remain at the current
high levels.
   Andrew Lebow, oil-futures analyst at E.D. &amp; F. Man
International Futures, said the main impetus behind oil's
rise was comments over the weekend by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein. Traders were particularly alarmed by his threat to
attack Saudi Arabia and Israel in retaliation for the embargo
against Iraq.
   Already, Mr. Lebow said, "the market psychology had been
changing from hope for a possible peaceful solution to the
expectation of a military solution. But even if Hussein said
nothing, we'd probably see oil prices stay high because of
the change in psychology."
   Oil also affected the dollar, which ended mixed. Traders
sold yen because of Japan's economic vulnerability to
oil-price swings and bought currencies of oil-producing
countries such as Canada and Britain.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices sank. Volume was 162.2 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues far
outnumbered advancers, 1,432 to 233.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell in moderate trading.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency fell to 1.5590 marks from 1.5785 and rose to 137.35
yen from 136.65 yen Friday.
