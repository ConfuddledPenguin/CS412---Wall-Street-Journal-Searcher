   FORT IRWIN, Calif. -- South of Death Valley, the good guys
usually die young.
   Here, on the sun-scorched sands of the Army's most
desolate base, American soldiers meet the enemy, or "Opfor."
This is the resident 177th Armored Brigade, specially trained
to play the role of a battle-hardened, Soviet-schooled
adversary -- like the Iraqis. It's the only training most
Army troops get in desert warfare before hitting the ground
in the Middle East. Casualties are high, though usually not
for the Opposition Force brigade which is so used to
practicing together that it nearly always wins.

   This morning, snaking through the shadows of the stark
brown hills, an American armored task force runs smack into
an Opfor enemy ambush. A U.S. M-1 tank commander puts out a
desperate radio call to comrades he fears are being
annihilated: "Zulu-Nine-Six to any living element." One of
the war game observers can't resist breaking into the
distress call. "You're in charge, Bart," he jokes.
   Since this training center opened in 1981, nearly 400,000
troops from around the country have challenged the Opposition
Force in games considered the ultimate nonviolent test of
desert fighting. Many visiting units, exposed to few other
combat exercises, treat the three weeks here as the
centerpiece of their year. The Opfor serves as "an
Olympic-quality sparring partner," teaching trainees by their
mistakes and hammering in skills usable on a real
battlefield, says Col. James Patrick O'Neal, commander of the
2,200 armored and infantry troops of the 177th.
   Maintaining cadres skilled in enemy tactics has been a
favored Pentagon training method since the Vietnam War, which
revealed the price of not knowing enough about an opponent's
approach to combat. The Air Force Red Flag program and the
Navy Top Gun school also use resident teams that fight
Soviet-style in games with U.S. forces.
   Today's exercise is particularly relished by Opfor
Specialist Russ Helms, who wears the bad guy's traditional
black hat (in this case, a beret). From his tank, made in the
U.S. but modified to resemble a Soviet T-72, he is especially
intent on punishing the current visitors, the Second Brigade
of the Fifth Infantry Division based at Fort Polk, La. "It's
my old unit, and they've been dying like flies," he says
gleefully.
   As in all mock combat, reality is relative: Fort Irwin
commanders give these games about a 75% reality rating. In a
Persian Gulf battle, troops wouldn't have to worry about
running their tanks over threatened desert tortoises. Here,
they are instructed to go around them.
   Bullets and shells are simulated by the "multiple
integrated laser engagement system," a $40 million electronic
network tying battles to a computer in a central building
popularly known as the Death Star. Every element in the
battle -- tanks, helicopters, individual soldiers -- is
equipped with a laser and a receiver that register kills and
set off a flashing yellow light or beeping device to mark
them.
   Tear gas or smoke replaces deadly chemical agents like
those in Iraq's arsenal -- though troops still must sweat out
simulated attacks wearing cumbersome suits and masks. To
reduce possible real injuries, like tanks running into each
other, the Army limits the number of exercises at night and
in the most stifling afternoon heat. (While temperatures at
times reach 120 degrees, the dry Mojave Desert lacks the
drenching humidity of the Persian Gulf.) And shortly before
the Gulf crisis erupted, Air Force fighter support was cut
for cost reasons.
   Still, says Rand Corp. researcher Martin Goldsmith, who
has studied the Fort Irwin games extensively, "I have never
heard of a training center that tries to replicate the
battlefield to this extent." And Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the joint chiefs of staff, said recently he believes
American soldiers can survive an Iraqi chemical weapons
attack because of the training many received on this remote,
1,000-square-mile reservation, midway between Los Angeles and
Las Vegas.
   All well and good. But could troops trained for only three
weeks in Southern California survive an engagement with
battle-tested Iraqi troops in the Arabian desert?
   On the almost lunar-appearing battlefield here -- a much
rockier landscape than the drifting Saudi sands -- the
Louisianans seem to have the Mideast crisis on their minds.
Before the battle began at daybreak, the Fort Polk brigade
commander, Col. Robert Coffey, had hoped his troops might win
a rare victory, spurred by the realization that their next
encounter could be real. "The soldiers are concerned. They
read the papers," he says.
   And as the fighting continues this day, it seems Col.
Coffey may be right.
   The ambushed American task force isn't in quite the sorry
shape initially thought. Half its numbers -- held up for a
time by simulated mines that close distant Bicycle Lake Pass
-- now are following the trail of flashing lights on the
"dead" U.S. armor that has gone before. The force covers its
approach with smokescreens along the windswept base of the
Tiefort Mountains, until it joins the ambushed troops.
   Viewed from a nearby hill, battle seems a muffled chaos,
with lots of smoke and bursts from the tank-mounted
pyrotechnics simulating cannon fire.
   Facing a reinforced adversary, the Opfor tanks quickly
withdraw from forward lines they have set up according to
Soviet combat doctrine. In pulling back to join their main
force, several are hit and destroyed.
   When the battle is finally called off at 1 p.m., data
compiled in the Death Star cheers Col. Coffey. "It was a
clear win," he says proudly. He believes it could have been a
rout had fighter-plane support been available to him. One
lesson learned, though: how complicated things get when the
battlefield becomes "dirty," or contaminated by chemical
weapons. His troops all have had to wear
anti-chemical-warfare gear much of the day, because it was
unclear where the enemy had launched its simulated chemical
attack and when it ended. All this is duly noted in the
stacks of analytical videotapes and computer printouts to be
dispensed to him after the training.
   The day's fighting claims nearly half the Opposition
Force. Found resting atop his tank, waiting for the detailed
battle review to be announced, Cpl. Charles Ellery of the
Opfor seems surprised the Louisianans did so well. "Artillery
got us," he shouts to a passing observer. Cpl. Ellery says he
dies "about 50% of the time." Opfor Specialist Helms, who had
been eager to take on his old unit, "died" in the battle too.
   Col. Coffey's toll is considered extremely good: Of 1,600
troops sent into combat, several hundred are killed or
wounded, and 19 of 35 tanks and 18 of 28 personnel carriers
are lost. It's a far cry from earlier battles at Fort Irwin,
when the brigade was cut to pieces.
   The military knows, though, that heroics under simulated
fire may not be carried over into actual battle. "If they
were handing out congressional medals around here," a saying
at the National Training Center goes, "there would be 12 a
day."
