   With its financing prospects still uncertain, the union
group trying to acquire United Airlines parent UAL Corp.
raised the possibility that the buy-out might fail, forcing
it to resume conventional labor negotiations. The group faces
an Oct. 9 deadline to get financing.
   In a letter to pilots over the weekend, the three top
officers of the United pilots union accused UAL Chairman
Stephen M. Wolf in the strongest terms yet of trying to
thwart the proposed employee buy-out. The pilot leaders also
threatened a strike to obtain higher wages if the takeover
attempt fails.

   In a rare display of battle-weariness, the union officers
raised the possibility that labor might have to abandon the
buy-out attempt eventually. The 3 1/2-year takeover effort
"has been fatiguing to everyone," the pilots acknowledged.
"Particularly frustrating is how close we have come, and yet,
{employee ownership} remains elusive."
   Although the labor group unveiled terms of a revised bid
to a group of banks last week, prospects that a new offer
will succeed remain dim. UAL's stock price tumbled $8.50 to
$92.25 yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The drop reflected in part news of ever-higher oil
prices and tightening credit conditions among major U.S. and
Japanese banks.
   The pilots' letter accused Mr. Wolf, who would lose his
job if the employees succeed, of telling the board that
employee ownership "is not broadly supported" by the union
rank and file. "Unfortunately, some members of the board
believe him," the letter added. The pilots also said an
anonymous anti-takeover, "pro-Wolf" campaign had developed at
certain crew bases.
   The union leaders asked their members to counter that
campaign with letters to the board, expressing support for
the buy-out.
   A spokesman for Mr. Wolf said the chairman hadn't seen the
pilots' letter. However, in a statement, the company cited
"growing concern within the industry and among United
employees about being a highly leveraged carrier in these
uncertain economic times."
   UAL's board is set to meet Thursday and may seek a
progress report on the employee buy-out effort. A UAL
spokeswoman said directors will judge any new bid "on its
merits."
   In their letter, the union leaders warned they will seek
substantial wage increases for pilots through traditional
bargaining methods "if prospects for employee ownership cease
to exist." The leaders said the pilots union will pursue all
avenues to obtain higher wages "up to and including a
strike."
   Such moves could throw UAL into internal chaos at a time
when it is expanding into new markets and, like other
airlines, may need to cut costs as a way of dealing with
substantially higher fuel prices and softening domestic
traffic.
   The unions have pledged more than $2 billion in wage cuts
to fund the employee buy-out. But all bets would be off if
the takeover fails.
   The intensifying union rhetoric reflects the increasing
stakes for the buy-out group as it struggles to put together
a new offer in time for the Oct. 9 deadline. The labor
coalition of pilots, machinists and flight attendants were
unable to obtain financing for a $201-a-share, $4.38 billion
offer last month.
   The group is trying to put together a bid of $175-a-share
in cash and securities for 85% of the shares outstanding,
leaving 15% of the shares in the hands of existing holders.
Takeover stock traders value the offer at less than $160 a
share, or $3.49 billion.
   One person familiar with the effort said the labor group
may also propose a version with a higher price tag, but
without cash. Instead, new debt securities would be issued to
UAL stockholders in an exchange offer.
   UAL's board is said to be split on whether to accept a bid
lower than the $201-a-share offer directors approved under
the threat of a proxy fight in April. The board could argue
that the new offer is insufficient. But in that case, it
risks inciting the unions and shareholders who have taken
substantial losses in the on-again, off-again takeover
attempt.
   It is also unclear whether even a lower offer can be
financed. The unions have asked banks to make commitments for
a $2 billion loan by Oct. 3. In their letter, the pilot
leaders acknowledge that instability in the Middle East is
hampering the buy-out negotiations.
