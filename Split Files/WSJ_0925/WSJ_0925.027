   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation limiting the
commercial time during children's television programs.
   The House is expected to pass the compromise bill soon.
The White House has raised First Amendment concerns but
hasn't directly threatened a veto.

   The measure would limit advertising during children's
programs to 10 1/2 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes
an hour on weekdays. It also would require broadcasters to
provide programming that addresses children's need for
information and education.
   The compromise worked out by Senate Democrats and House
Republicans would set up the National Endowment for
Children's Educational Television, funded with $2 million in
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and $4 million in fiscal
1992. The endowment would provide grants for creating and
producing educational programming, with the Commerce
Department controlling the grants.
   The Senate passed children's TV legislation in July that
would have established the endowment with $10 million in
fiscal 1991. But the House version, which passed later that
month, didn't include the endowment. House Republicans had
argued that the fund should be part of public broadcasting's
authorization.
