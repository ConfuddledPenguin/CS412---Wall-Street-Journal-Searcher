   LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Carolco Pictures Inc. said it
agreed to buy back about 3.4 million shares from its
chairman, Mario Kassar, for $45 million, or $13 a share --
giving Mr. Kassar a profit of about $11.5 million.
   The purchase price was well above the market price.
Carolco shares closed yesterday at $7.25 each, down 25 cents,
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The
company didn't give an explanation for the higher price in
its release. A spokesman declined to elaborate.

   Mr. Kassar purchased 11.2 million shares from Andrew
Vajna, the company's former co-chairman, for about $108
million, or $9.60 a share, last November. Based on that
price, Mr. Kassar made a profit of about $11.5 million in his
recent sale of shares to the company.
   The repurchase will leave Mr. Kassar with 15.1 million
shares, or a 57% stake in Carolco, which recently produced
the movie "Total Recall." As part of the agreement, Mr.
Kassar will also receive warrants to acquire 1 million shares
of common at $18.50 a share.
   Carolco said it will convert the 3.4 million repurchased
shares into treasury stock, reducing its common shares
outstanding to about 26.7 million shares from about 30.2
million.
   After buying the shares from Mr. Vajna, Mr. Kassar sold
about 3.85 million shares to four institutional investors at
prices ranging from $10.50 to $11.50 a share.
   Carolco agreed to sell convertible preferred shares to
Canal Plus Productions and Pioneer LDCA for $90 million.
Those preferred shares are convertible into common at $18.50
a share. Carolco had said previously that it will use about
half of the $90 million in proceeds to purchase an
unspecified number of shares from Mr. Kassar but the price
wasn't set until recently.
   Carolco shares traded at a high of $13.75 each last June
of 1990.
