   BOSTON -- EMC Corp. will report a third-quarter profit
compared with a year-earlier loss, and expects "strong
growth" in sales and earnings in the fourth quarter, Chairman
Richard J. Egan said.
   Mr. Egan also said that a new computer disk storage
technology EMC will introduce today "could add as much as
$100 million" to revenue next year. The new data storage
product is designed for mainframe computers.

   If his forecast pans out, EMC would witness a reversal of
two years of annual losses. In the most recent quarter, ended
June 30, the company had net income of $2 million, or eight
cents a share, on revenue of $42.7 million. In the year-ago
second quarter, net income was $124,000, or one cent a share,
on revenue of $34.6 million.
   Mr. Egan says he expects third-quarter net income to be
flat or "slightly ahead of" second-quarter results. In the
1989 third quarter, the Hopkinton, Mass., company reported a
net loss of $3.6 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of
$92 million.
   Mr. Egan said gross margins have improved so far this year
and that cost controls remain in place. He added that
analysts' revenue estimate of $170 million to $180 million
this year are "reasonable." In 1989, EMC reported revenue of
$132.3 million.
   The disk technology, known as RAID, or redundant arrays of
inexpensive disks, combines a solid-state memory cache with
dozens of small, high-capacity hard-disk drives. The arrays
are smaller, use less power, and are less expensive than
mainframe disk drives in use today. International Business
Machines Corp., which dominates the mainframe market, also is
working on the technology.
   Mr. Egan says EMC will beat IBM to market when EMC begins
volume shipment of RAID drives early next year.
