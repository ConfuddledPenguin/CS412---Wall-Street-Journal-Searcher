   You're not supposed to mention the word "sequestration" in
polite circles. Gramm-Rudman's forced budget cuts, one is
told, must be avoided at all costs, or else. Or else what?
Will skies darken and locusts multiply?
   The truth is that no one, including the White House, knows
exactly what would happen under Gramm-Rudman. But consider
the possibility that automatic spending cuts would not be the
end of the world. A well-managed sequester might be better
for the economy than the
tax-now-and-we-promise-to-cut-spending-later deal now in the
making.

   Administration officials led by Richard Darman have
painted a bleak sequester of airplanes stacked up without
air-traffic controllers and ranchers bankrupted by plants
closed when meat inspectors are furloughed. Maybe the OMB
Director hopes horror will scare up a better deal. But
yesterday the White House announced, "We're not even close on
the spending cut side." And probably further away than that
on the promised enforcement for any deal to guarantee that
spending cuts occur.
   The nation has watched Coach Darman try three yards and a
cloud of dust for weeks. It's time to go to the
bomb-sequestration. With a little effort, we suspect the
people who work for the President can find out for themselves
how much wiggle room there is for Mr. Bush to manage a
non-budget to minimize inconvenience to the public while
maximizing pressure for a worthy budget deal.
   A successful sequester is possible, but it would take some
work. Gramm-Rudman is supposed to cut tens of billions of
dollars equally from defense and domestic programs. Many
entitlement programs are exempt. Mr. Bush told Congress he
will exempt the soldiers now stationed in the Persian Gulf.
So the question is what else Mr. Bush can do to keep
important government functions going.
   For starters, Mr. Bush needs to remember how his
predecessor responded under similar circumstances. The
Democrats have suggested passing a continuing resolution to
buy more time before Gramm-Rudman's cuts go into effect. Mr.
Bush sent word that he'd likely veto a continuing resolution.
If he does, he could use the blueprint provided to President
Reagan for keeping the country running during a "total" fund
cutoff.
   The effects were minor in 1982 because White House
staffers had scoured the statutes to discover the
Anti-Deficiency Act. The act says that no money can be spent
without prior authorization by Congress, a recognition of its
power over the purse. The law, however, also contains a huge
exception, which gives wide discretion to the President.
   The law says that federal workers can continue at their
posts even without funding if their absence would cause
"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the
protection of property." Under this exception, President
Reagan sent home some 500,000 workers, but kept on essential
personnel, including almost the entire Pentagon. Under this
rule, air-traffic controllers and meat inspectors can be
exempt from temporary cutbacks under this rule.
   Even under Gramm-Rudman, Mr. Bush can keep paying military
personnel so long as he promises to deduct the payments from
longer-term Pentagon expenses such as weapons programs.
Gramm-Rudman exempts the entire military from the cuts only
"if a declaration of war by the Congress is in effect."
   The more difficult question is how the exceptions under
the Anti-Deficiency Act would apply with Gramm-Rudman
standing alongside. There is a good case that Mr. Bush could
still exempt federal employees or programs necessary to
protect life or property. The argument would be that this
exception is an inherent constitutional power of the
executive branch, written into law by the Anti-Deficiency Act
and applicable even under Gramm-Rudman.
   Surely the strongest case for inherent temporary spending
authority by a President is during a period of gross
congressional incompetence. Congress has now been in
violation of the Congressional Budget Act since May 15, when
its budget was due. With Congress in its fourth month as a
fugutive from its own budget law, the President can invoke
his constitutional duty to make sure the laws are "faithfully
executed."
   It makes more sense for a President to use whatever powers
he has to fund critical programs than for him, say, to get a
federal prosecutor to indict the congressional leadership for
violating the budget-deadline law.
   It is remarkable that apparently no lawyers at the White
House, OMB or the Justice Department have studied how to make
a sequester manageable. This means no one, including the
President, knows his options.
   Mr. Bush currently has an approval rating of 75%. Sending
home a few hundred thousand bureaucrats could push the figure
toward 90% so long as the relatively few federal workers who
are truly necessary stay on the job. The country might even
get used to a federal budget limited to spending for "the
safety of human life or the protection of property."
