   NEW YORK -- A shareholder filed a lawsuit against Chase
Manhattan Corp. and its two top executives, accusing them of
making false and misleading statements about the bank's
financial condition in recent months.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks to
be made a class action for all investors who bought Chase
stock between Jan. 17 and Friday, when Chase cut its dividend
50% to 30 cents a share.

   A Chase spokesman said the suit is without merit.
   The lawsuit alleges that the company's stock price was
artificially inflated in recent months because of misleading,
optimistic statements by Chase -- starting with the
announcement of a dividend increase Jan. 17.
   It also claims that Chase knew for several months that its
loan-loss reserves were inadequate and that it couldn't
afford to maintain its common-stock dividend. The lawsuit
alleges that Chase intentionally misled investors by
misrepresenting and not disclosing certain information about
the company's loan portfolio.
   "The numerous representations made by defendants
concerning Chase's improved financial condition, the adequacy
of the bank's loan-loss reserves and the projections for
accelerated earnings were materially false and misleading and
not reasonably based," the lawsuit said. "The increase in the
dividend in January 1990 was intended to mislead investors as
to the company's true financial condition."
   Chase, in addition to halving its dividend, announced
Friday that it was setting aside $650 million in the current
quarter as additional reserves against potential losses on
domestic loans, mainly in real estate. The company also is
reducing its 41,000-person staff by 5,000.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Chase closed at $11.125 a share, down $1.625. The
stock was trading at about $32 a share in mid-January, the
start of the period in question in the suit.
   Besides the company, the suit names Willard Butcher,
chairman and chief executive officer, and Thomas Labrecque,
president and chief operating officer. Mr. Butcher will
retire next month, and Mr. Labrecque will succeed him.
   The lawsuit, filed by Israel Margolies of Peoria, Ill.,
seeks unspecified damages. At least three other lawsuits
making the same claims also were filed in federal court
yesterday.
