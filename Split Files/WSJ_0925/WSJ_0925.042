   Chicago -- Remember the women's marathon at the L.A.
Olympics? Gabriela Andersen-Scheiss, representing
Switzerland, struggled toward the finish line of the
26-plus-mile run, stopping and starting, listing to one side
and clutching her head. Physicians hovered around her,
anxious to step in and halt the agony. Spectators didn't know
whether to cheer or cry.
   She made it, all right, and after a drink and bite to eat
was perkily giving TV interviews. The image of her travail,
however, is recalled by the three still-undecided Major
League pennant races.

   You well may say that any races are better than none at
all, which seemed to be the prospect on Sept. 1, when
Oakland, Boston, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh enjoyed nicely
padded edges in their divisions. But the only team to stay
prosperous is defending champion Oakland, which controls more
talent than the William Morris Agency.
   The rest are lurching along, Gaby-like. Cincinnati, once a
runaway leader, probably banked the NL West flag by taking a
doubleheader from San Diego on Saturday, but not before
allowing the L.A. Dodgers to threaten. In the AL East, the
Red Sox were so traumatized by the injury loss of Roger
Clemens, a once-every-five-days starting pitcher, on Sept. 4,
that they have dropped 12 of 18 outings since.
   That turned a 6 1/2-game Boston lead into a deficit, which
the lucky beneficiaries -- the Toronto Blue Jays -- have
since done their best to squander. The Jays were one game
ahead at the close of business Sunday as Boston lost its
eighth of the last 11.
   No race, though, has perplexed more than the one in the NL
East. The Pirates and Mets, weekend visitors here, have
played tag all year, with the Bucs mostly staying just out of
the Mets' reach. Every time it looks like one team will
sprint away, it stumbles. Sometimes, both stumble together.
   Take last week. Please. The Mets started it just a
half-game behind Pittsburgh, thanks in part to a two-game
home sweep of the Pirates, but then they dropped two of three
to Philadelphia and three of three to Montreal, the last pair
in a doubleheader against two pitchers named Brian Barnes and
Chris Nabholz who are just up from the minors.
   On Friday, New York stretched its loss streak to five, and
the Buc lead to 3 1/2 games, with a 4-3 loss to the Cubs. The
winning run was scored when Mets' catcher Charlie O'Brien
threw into centerfield trying to catch Jerome Walton stealing
second base. Walton went to third, and scored on a fly ball.
   Saturday it was Pittsburgh's turn to founder; while the
Mets were winning here, they lost to St. Louis, 3-2, with the
tying and winning runs scoring in the eighth inning on three
walks and a wild pitch. Pirate manager Jim Leyland fumed
afterward about "bad concentration." His relief pitching
wasn't so hot, either. "Mirabile dictu," both teams won on
Sunday, leaving the Pirates with a 2 1/2-game lead with nine
games left for them and 10 for the Mets going into Monday
afternoon's Mets-Cubs finale. That was fine with New York
manager Bud Harrelson. Considering the alternatives, "we're
fortunate to be where we are," sighed the old shortstop, over
his sushi (no fooling).
   Before the campaign began, just about everybody with a
typewriter or microphone -- and, of course, most Gothamites
-- thought the Mets would be at the top looking down at this
point, and the fact they aren't is a big reason for the
current perplexity. This gang, after all, has pitching
openers galore in six proven starters -- more than some
entire divisions -- a certified bullpen closer in John
Franco, and enough power to replace Con Ed. But instead of
mighty they've been flighty.
   Consider some stats. The Mets' won-lost mark after Sunday
was 85-67, but they were 34-40 on the road, 31-39 in games
decided by two or fewer runs, 24-31 against lefthanded
starting pitchers and 18-24 on artificial turf. Right after
Harrelson replaced Davey Johnson in the dugout they had a
21-7 June, but they're just 38-36 since the All-Star Game
break.
   Part of the problem is the wooden-Indian defense the New
Yorkers field, especially since losing shortstop Kevin Elster
to shoulder woes. Another, and related, part is a lack of
speed that requires three hits to score a run unless someone
knocks the ball out of the ballpark.
   Finally, there has been the lack of coordination between
"O" and "D" that's at the root of many sad baseball stories.
Remarked Harrelson on Sunday after "Doc" Gooden pitched, and
various guys hit, the Mets to a 7-3 win, on the heels of a
similar, 11-5, outcome Saturday: "It was nice to get good
offense and starting pitching in the same game. It's been
awhile since that happened."
   The weekend unfolded before the usual signatories to the
ABM (Anyone But the Mets) Treaty that greet the New Yorkers
on the road. Some 55,000 showed up in autumnal chill, the
vast majority of them as much anti-Met as pro-Cubbie. "I Love
to Hate the Mets," read one fan's sign Saturday, and on
Sunday a guy went around outside Wrigley Field carrying an
effigy wearing a Mets T-shirt and pins with which to puncture
it. "Stick it to the Mets]" he offered, and many did.
   The Mets, however, stuck it to the Cubbies, especially
starting pitchers Gooden and the seldom-used Ron Darling, and
Darryl Strawberry, the sinewy, but sometimes sluggish,
slugger. Dare-ul homered both Saturday and Sunday, the latter
clout breaking a 0-0 sixth inning to run his season total to
37, along with a team-record 107 runs batted in.
   Better late than never, the Straw declared: "We know this
is it -- we win or we're through." And if they don't, they'll
have some explaining to do.
