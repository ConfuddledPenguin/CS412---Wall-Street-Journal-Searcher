   In their consideration of Judge David Souter's fitness to
sit on the Supreme Court, senators should recall the
observation of Charles Evans Hughes, just two years before
the confirmation struggle over his appointment as chief
justice in 1930: "If conscientious, able, and independent men
are put on the bench, you cannot predict their course as
judges by reference either to partisan motives or to personal
or party loyalties. If you could get further down to the
bedrock of convictions as to what are conceived to be
fundamental principles of government and social relations,
you might be able to get closer to accurate prophecy. But you
cannot expect to have judges worthy of the office who are
without convictions . . ." ("Hughes, The Supreme Court of the
United States," page 49; 1928). If Hughes was correct,
senators may learn more about Judge Souter by probing
"fundamental principles" than by enticing him to speak out on
current constitutional issues.
