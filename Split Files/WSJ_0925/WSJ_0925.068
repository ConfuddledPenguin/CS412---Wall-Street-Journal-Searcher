   THE 1990 CENSUS reflects restless feet in the nation's
labor force.
   Preliminary population figures, the first census reports
so far, show West Virginia with a 9% drop since 1980, the
largest for a state. As coal mechanization sped on, 143,000
people left the Mountain State by 1989, an earlier report
said. The employment slump ended recently, but "our big
concern now is what a national recession will do" to the
state's jobs, says Edward Merrifield, a state labor research
official.

   Analysts warn that steady out-migration from an area can
cause a downward job spiral, deterring new business as the
labor supply dwindles. Industrial states like Michigan,
Illinois and Pennsylvania also lost people, the early 1990
figures suggest. But a combined 7.1 million people migrated
to sunny California, Arizona, Texas and Florida between 1980
and 1989, many taking new service jobs.
   The worker migration means "another union organizing task,
in a more hostile location," complains AFL-CIO economist John
Zalusky.
                                                                                                       

   UNIONS ESCALATE efforts to influence reapportionment in
wake of census.
   The American Federation of Federal, State, County and
Municipal Employees leads a drive to help Democrats control
16 key state legislatures and win hot gubernatorial contests
in California, Texas and Florida Nov. 6. The governors' veto
power will give them a "key role" when state lawmakers start
congressional redistricting in 1991, notes AFL-CIO political
chief John Perkins. "This is when your investment pays
dividends for five elections {through the year 2000}," a Food
Workers official adds.
   Some 45 unions, including auto, steel and communications
workers, teachers and letter carriers, contributed over half
of $5 million raised for the Democrats' five-year "Project
500," and unions "give us the bodies" for polling and
research, a party spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   SEX, AGE AND SKILL factors loom large for the future work
force.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics sees an increase of older
workers by 2000. Of men over 54 years old, 68% will be
working, up from 67% in 1988, and of women in the same age
group, 49% will be working, up from 43.5%. But with new
census data, the agency may boost those numbers even further,
showing more oldsters on the job, BLS statistician Howard
Fullerton says. By 2000, the median worker age will rise to
35, and 85% of new workers will be less technically trained
women and minorities, concludes a Purdue University study.
   The census reports will show a sizable widening of the pay
gap between high-school and college graduates, reflecting the
decisions of many to skip college in the 1980s, says
University of Maryland economist Frank Levy.
   That gap rose from a median $2,659 for men and $5,486 for
women, ages 25 to 34, to an inflation-adjusted $9,089 and
$7,812, respectively, from 1979 to 1987.
                                                                                                       

   STATES LOSING JOBS get some advice from Hudson Institute
official William Johnston: Don't try to lure new factories in
this service economy. Instead, "visit {Disney Chairman}
Michael Eisner to see if he wants to locate a theme park" in
the area.
                                                                                                       

   UNDERCOUNTING could fuel legislative moves to boost
immigration quotas by showing an excessive labor shortage,
says National Planning Association economist Richard Belous.
If short counts are concentrated in certain immigrant-heavy,
low-income localities, they could also reduce federal
job-training grants.
                                                                                                       

   DOWN ON THE FARM: They aren't keeping them there. About
3.7 million people were working on more-mechanized farms and
ranches in mid-July, down 3% from the same 1989 week and 19%
from 1980, the Agriculture Department said. But hired hands
are on the rise, supplanting many farm-family workers.
                                                                                                       

   POPULATION AGE CHANGES have a marked effect on
unemployment rates.
   So concludes a new study by Paul Flaim, BLS chief of labor
force statistics. An influx of post-World War II baby boomers
into the job market helped push the jobless rate upward in
the 1960s and 1970s. "Short on skills and work experience,
youths could not readily substitute for older workers," so
employers were less eager to hire them, Mr. Flaim says.
   But maturing and even "graying" of the boomers sparked the
1980s decline in the rate. So did a drop in the number of
teenagers, along with a shrinkage in the size of the work
force. Changing age demographics, not any rise in the demand
for labor, explain a 10-year drop in the jobless rate from
5.9% to 5.3% by 1989, Mr. Flaim argues.
   In the '90s, a further shrinkage of young job seekers is
expected, but many employers will stiffen demands to show
skills.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Noting that no labor-market data will emerge
from the 1990 census until 1992 or later, economist Sar
Levitan muses, "The more advanced the technology, the slower
the data publication." . . . No solace here: For those who
wonder about domestic energy capacity with Iraqi-held oil
shut off, the Census Bureau says oil and gas extraction
employment is down 25% from 1980.
