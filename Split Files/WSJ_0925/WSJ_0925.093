   HOUSTON -- Offshore Pipelines Inc. said it expects to
report a net loss of $2.5 million to $3 million, or 60 cents
to 72 cents a share, for the year ended July 31.
   Revenue was about $125 million, according to the marine
construction services concern, which went public in July
1989. It had net of about $3.9 million, or $1.02 a share, on
revenue of about $103.9 million in fiscal 1989.

   The company attributed the expected loss to the
rescheduling of a significant project to the first quarter of
fiscal 1991 as well as increased interest costs, nonrecurring
relocation expenses and cost overruns on certain projects.
