   TAIPEI -- In a reception room of red and gold -- the
Chinese colors for luck and prosperity -- President Lee
Teng-hui comes across as relaxed and thoughtful; a tall,
smiling, professorial type in a blue suit and bifocals. But
this unassuming man has taken on a large job. In an interview
Friday with three Journal reporters, he describes his goal of
achieving on Taiwan the world's first enduringly democratic
Chinese society. He hopes this might help lead to freedom for
the Communist mainland.
   "We hope China will be reunited soon," says Mr. Lee,
speaking through an interpreter. "But it has to be under the
principle of free economics, democracy and free elections."

   It wasn't so long ago that many saw the Nationalist claim
to mainland China as fiction. But with the world lauding the
Cold War's end, that claim deserves a closer look. Taiwan has
become a model of economic and political progress, while the
mainland Communists have wrought poverty, repression and last
year's suppression of the democracy movement.
   Though Communist China today enjoys the diplomatic
recognition stripped from the Republic of China in the 1970s,
Taiwan is quantum leaps worthier of world esteem. Mr. Lee is
delivering the kind of free society that mainland
demonstrators last year were demanding in Tiananmen Square.
At Saturday's opening in Beijing of the 1990 Asian Games, the
delegation that along with Kuwait drew the greatest applause
was Taiwan -- a crowd reaction surely meant as a snub to
Beijing.
   The fall of communism in Europe has inspired hope of a
similar collapse among the creaking holdouts of Asia,
including those aging leaders of the People's Republic of
China. The rapid reunification of Germany, for example, makes
it tempting to seek parallels in the two Chinas.
   It all starts to look like precisely the kind of opening
for which the Nationalist government has been waiting since
Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces seized the mainland, in 1949,
and Chiang Kai-shek retreated with two million mainlanders to
Taiwan and set up the Republic of China's capital in Taipei.
Chiang and his Kuomintang followers vowed they or their
successors would return to free the mainland.
   So began one of the most impressive postwar flowerings in
the Far East. Though Chiang Kai-shek ruled on Taiwan as a
dictator, he did respect some basic institutions of a free
society, such as private property. He also opened the island
more and more to trade. This produced decades of double-digit
economic growth, and rising demand for a more open political
process. When Chiang died, in 1975, leadership passed to his
son Chiang Ching-kuo. The younger Chiang turned out to be a
reformer. In 1987, the year before he died, he lifted martial
law, allowed opposition parties to organize, began opening up
travel to the mainland and ended what was becoming a Chiang
dynasty.
   Chiang Ching-kuo's hand-picked vice president and
successor was Mr. Lee, now 67, who was born on Taiwan. This
has helped gain him support from citizens of Taiwanese
descent, who make up some 85% of the island's 20 million
people. Mr. Lee was educated in Japan and the U.S. as an
agricultural economist, and taught at Taiwan's leading
university before going into government.
   It's a background in keeping with the softer approach
toward the mainland that Taipei has been evolving for some
time. Mr. Lee does not think that China will take the German
fast track to reunification. Nor does he speak of retaking
the mainland by force. Instead, he looks to "long-term
gradual communication" to help bring about reunification on
Taiwan's terms.
   The main task Mr. Lee faces for the rest of his term,
which expires in 1996, is bringing government policies into
line with the freedoms that people on Taiwan have already
seized for themselves. This involves a balancing act among
the Kuomintang old guard, a younger, more liberal generation
of Kuomintang members, and a vigorous opposition that in some
cases has been pushing for Taiwan independence. That position
is still officially considered seditious on Taiwan, though
now it is often discussed. The mainland doesn't like the idea
of Taiwanese independence either, and has repeatedly
threatened to invade should Taiwan try it.
   "Whatever we do, we have to respect our constitution,"
says Mr. Lee, who several times during the interview stresses
the importance of the rule of law. The stickiest problem is
how to reconcile local democracy with the 1947 Nationalist
constitution, which provides for representation of all China.
Mr. Lee himself was elected this year to his current term by
the National Assembly, a branch of government whose job is to
elect the president. It is still made up of old deputies who
have held office since before the 1949 loss of the mainland.
This setup provoked protests, including a student hunger
strike at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek memorial.
   Mr. Lee's response was to call a constitutional reform
conference in June, to which he invited outspoken members of
the opposition as well as members of the ruling Kuomintang.
The proposals that emerged were vague, but Mr. Lee suggests
that what might prove workable would be a body "similar to
the electoral college of America." The idea would be to hold
the mainland seats in trust, with mainland deputies
temporarily bound to follow the Taiwan popular vote.
   A similar problem of aging mainlanders in the legislature
has been heading toward a gradual resolution, with an
increasing proportion of seats going to legislators elected
on Taiwan. Some 60% of all government spending is done by the
central government, 40% by the Taiwan provincial and local
authorities. This balance will continue to shift away from
the central government, according to the finance minister,
Wang Chien-shien.
   In mainland affairs, Taipei is also scrambling to square
its rules with reality. A few years ago, the strict
government policy was the three nos: "No contact, no
negotiation, no compromise" with the mainland. These days,
Taiwan's finance minister freely acknowledges that
businessmen from Taiwan have become big unofficial investors
in Communist China. It's even easy to direct-dial Beijing. To
start catching up with the traffic, Taiwan's Board of Foreign
Trade last week announced it will officially permit the
importation from China of dozens of goods, including badger
hair, bamboo and coal.
   The difficulty is judging at what point contact with the
mainland might backfire into subversion on Taiwan. Since the
U.S. withdrew recognition in 1978, Taipei has been keenly
aware that it lacks firm allies. Mr. Lee hopes that should a
mainland attack ever come, the U.S. might provide some
military aid. But "we don't think we should count on America
or the Japanese." Indeed, for all the business ties with
Japan today, he's not yet ready to trust the Japanese in a
clinch: "Most of the Asian people cannot forget what Japan
did in World War II." He hopes the U.S. will continue to
police the Asian Pacific.
   There have been some recent setbacks, mainly Saudi
Arabia's decision this year to switch recognition to Beijing
from Taipei. Increasingly, however, Taiwan has been shoring
up its ties abroad by claiming its place at international
events, such as this year's Asian Games.
   In 1988 Taiwan ended its boycott of Asian Development Bank
meetings, which it had begun when the ADB admitted mainland
China as a member in 1986. Last year the Republic of China
even sent its finance minister to an ADB meeting in Beijing
-- although the ADB imposes the craven requirement that it
attend under the name "Taipei, China," so as not to offend
the Chinese Communists. Taiwan has also been hoping to join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for which it is
well qualified. The only reason GATT won't make the offer is
the usual fear of offending mainland China, which wants in
first, and is still far from qualified.
   Taiwan's lingering insecurities are further evident in Mr.
Lee's asking one of his interviewers, Dow Jones Vice
President Karen Elliott House, whether she expects war over
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The interview runs half an hour
over the allotted 40 minutes as he discusses the fine points
of large military powers invading small neighbors.
   One defense Mr. Lee might usefully pursue is a faster
opening of Taiwan's markets to the world in general. Economic
ties are Taipei's most promising form of diplomacy. Mr. Lee
worries about U.S. protectionism, and notes that "we have to
expand our markets and depend on the international
community." He also predicts that "Taiwan will be able to
become a hub for Asian markets and a financial center." But
the government can't seem to work itself up to the serious
deregulation still needed. For example, Federal Express has
been considering setting up Taipei as a regional hub. So far,
however, the bureaucratic obstacles have been too great.
   Or, to take a more visible problem, by keeping out direct
foreign investors -- who tend to know something about
developing markets -- the government probably contributed to
the wild boom and more than 70% recent free fall of the
Taiwan stock market. This month's decision to let in big
pension funds still doesn't go far enough.
   Import controls and tariffs have been coming down for
years, but in slow steps that have kept domestic prices high.
As the world's 12th-largest trading power, Taiwan deserves
respect. But its economic controls can only hinder the
adjustments any economy must make to keep growing. By now,
they are driving away business.
   Nonetheless, the main impression after a meeting with
President Lee is that the Republic of China is steering a
worthy course. Other governments may lack the courage to
flout Beijing's claim to represent the Chinese people. Lee
Teng-hui reminds his visitors that Asian countries can move
forward only "with a free economy, democratic rule and
pluralistic society."
