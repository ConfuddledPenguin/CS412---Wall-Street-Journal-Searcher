   Diceon Electronics Inc. said it will have losses in its
fourth quarter and year ending Saturday, including a $5
million charge related to consolidation of facilities and
work force reductions.
   In fiscal 1989, the Irvine, Calif., maker of electronic
circuit boards had a loss of $2.3 million, or 39 cents a
share, on sales of $118.8 million.

   Diceon said it plans to eliminate about 225 jobs, or 15%
of its 1,500 employees, by year end. It also plans to halve
its Chatsworth, Calif., production space to about 35,000
square feet.
   Diceon said it has been consolidating its facilities in
San Jose, Calif., since its acquisition of privately held NTI
last year. Diceon expects to keep about 95,000 square feet of
production space in that area after closing several
buildings.
   A Diceon spokesman said the company has been hurt by
excess capacity and is "downsizing to become more efficient."
