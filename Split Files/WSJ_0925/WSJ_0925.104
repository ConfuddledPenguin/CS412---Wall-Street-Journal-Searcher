   A federal appeals court panel in Chicago cleared the way
for 3,000 Trans World Airlines Inc. employees to collect what
their lawyers say could be "tens of millions of dollars" in
back pay and damages stemming from their termination by the
air carrier after a three-month strike in early 1986.
   TWA violated a Labor Department regulation when, after it
fired the employees, it refused to notify them immediately of
their eligibility for preferred hiring status by other
airlines, the court said.

   The notification, known as a "designated rights letter,"
was an administrative vehicle used by the department to
implement the Employee Protection Program of the Airline
Deregulation Act of 1978. The employee-protection provided by
the act expired in 1988.
   With the letter, employees could have received
preferential treatment over other candidates for jobs with
other airline companies. TWA didn't send the notification
letter until February 1987.
   Each flight attendant will seek an average of two years'
back pay, to cover the period from May 17, 1986 -- when they
ended the strike and offered to return to work -- till they
were rehired by TWA.
   The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming a
lower court ruling that found TWA liable, remanded the case
to the trial court for a hearing on damages.
   An attorney for TWA, which is based in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
said the company was reviewing the decision.

   PARENT INDUSTRIES pleads guilty to racketeering in weapons
case.
   Parent Industries Inc., a holding company owned by James
H. Guerin, filed the plea in federal court in Philadelphia
yesterday, a month after federal prosecutors charged that the
company participated in a scheme to create more than $1
billion in phony weapons contracts.
   Mr. Guerin, who has not been charged with a crime, was the
creator of International Signal &amp; Control Corp., a global
weapons conglomerate based in Lancaster, Pa., that he started
in 1971 as a backyard industry.
   Parent, the holding company for all of Mr. Guerin's
assets, pleaded guilty to padding and falsifying weapons
contracts to inflate the value of International Signal &amp;
Control prior to its sale in 1987 to Ferranti International
PLC, Britain's third-largest defense contractor, for $670
million.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Parent will forfeit at
least $4 million and pay an additional $2.4 million in fines.
Mr. Guerin remains under investigation.
   In a plea memorandum filed by federal prosecutors, Mr.
Guerin is alleged to have "directed the financial fraud." His
attorney in Philadelphia, Joseph A. Tate, said Mr. Guerin and
Parent are cooperating with prosecutors.

   DENTISTS ARE CONVICTED in unusual price-fixing case.
   Three dentists were convicted in Tucson, Ariz., on charges
of conspiring to raise and fix fee amounts paid by their
patients, the Justice Department said. The case involved the
first criminal antitrust indictments and convictions of
medical practitioners in 50 years, according to Robert Bloch,
the prosecutor who supervised the case.
   The government in recent years has focused increased
attention on alleged antitrust violations in health care.
Previous cases have involved civil infractions related to
such things as hospital mergers. More criminal charges could
emerge from federal grand jury investigations under way in
Boston and in Savannah, Ga.
   The dentists in the Tucson case were found guilty of
conspiring to raise "co-payment" fees charged to members of
four prepaid dental plans. Co-payments are the extra amounts
that plan members must pay for certain non-routine
procedures, such as root-canal work.
   Convicted Sept. 20 in Tucson were Aaron Alston, Ronald
Walker and Richard Meyer. The dentists couldn't be reached
for comment. Stephen Weiss, Dr. Alston's lawyer, said a
motion has been filed requesting the judge to reverse the
jury's verdict "for lack of sufficient evidence." If the
motion is rejected, as typically happens, the three dentists
"in all likelihood would appeal," the lawyer added.
   Mr. Bloch said that the three men convicted were the
central figures in a conspiracy involving more than 30
dentists and affecting 80,000 dental-plan members. The price
collusion began as early as May 1987 and continued until
February of this year, according to the government.
   The defendants face possible prison terms of as much as
three years each, as well as individual fines of hundreds of
thousands of dollars. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 17.

   FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION official passes through revolving
door.
   Terry Calvani, a commissioner for seven years at the FTC
who briefly served as acting chairman during the mid-1980s,
will become a partner in the Washington law office of San
Francisco-based Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro.
   Mr. Calvani, whose term expires today, will begin work at
the 40-lawyer office tomorrow. An expert on antitrust issues,
Mr. Calvani said that he will advise clients on antitrust
matters pending at the FTC, and that he expects to represent
clients before the commission as soon as the law will allow.
In most instances, federal officials are permitted to
represent clients before their former agencies after a
one-year grace period.
   The White House said last week it would nominate Roscoe
Burton Starek, White House deputy director for personnel, to
fill Mr. Calvani's seat. Before going to the White House, the
42-year-old Mr. Starek worked for seven years in various
capacities at the State Department, including the post of
deputy assistant secretary for policy and counterterrorism.
He also held several legal positions on Capitol Hill in the
1970s.
   The post at the FTC requires Senate confirmation.

   TOBACCO ANTITRUST APPEAL: Brooke Group Ltd., formerly
Liggett Group Inc., sought reinstatement of a $148.8 million
jury award in its predatory price discrimination case against
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. After an eight-month trial,
the jury in Greensboro, N.C., had found that Brown &amp;
Williamson competed illegally in the market for low-priced,
generic cigarettes. Brown &amp; Williamson argued at trial and in
its motions to the judge that its price-cutting benefited,
rather than harmed, competition. Brooke is appealing a
federal trial judge's decision last month overturning the
verdict.
