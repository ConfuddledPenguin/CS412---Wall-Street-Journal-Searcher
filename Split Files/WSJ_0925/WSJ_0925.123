   NEW YORK -- The American Stock Exchange delayed today's
scheduled start of options trading on its Japan Index of 210
stocks.
   "We have regulatory clearance. We are just smoothing out
some last-minute details," a spokeswoman for the Amex said,
declining to be specific. The Amex said it will announce
another launch date today. The trading is designed to allow
investors to bet on the direction of Japan's stock market.

And the Chicago Board of Trade plans to trade in futures and
options on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Index of more than 1,200
stocks, starting Thursday night and continuing thereafter in
day and night trading.
