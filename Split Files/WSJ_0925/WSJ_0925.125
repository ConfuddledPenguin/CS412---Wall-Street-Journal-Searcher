   Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., one of the
world's largest consumer-electronics manufacturers, is in
talks with MCA Inc. regarding a possible acquisition of the
U.S. entertainment giant for $80 to $90 a share, or a range
of about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion, people familiar with
the talks said.
   The transaction would easily surpass Sony Corp.'s
acquisition last year of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
for $5 billion, and would be sure to stir more questions
about Japanese control of American assets. Columbia, like
MCA, produces films and television shows. But MCA is also
involved in areas ranging from publishing and theme parks to
management of Yosemite National Park facilities.

   MCA, parent of Universal Studios, has, like other media
and entertainment concerns, taken a beating on Wall Street
recently. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, it closed at $34.50, down 50 cents.
   The individuals with knowledge of the talks requested
anonymity and said it is far from certain that a deal will
materialize. They added that many barriers, such as
regulatory problems, remain. Unlike Columbia, for instance,
MCA owns a giant independent television station, WWOR in
Secaucus, N.J., which an overseas company would be prevented
from owning. But if it buys MCA, Matsushita, which had sales
in the year ended March 31 of about $44.4 billion, would be
following Sony in melding a vast "hardware" empire with
entertainment "software." Matsushita's brand names include
Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.
   The people familiar with the Matsushita talks said that
Michael Ovitz, the powerful head of talent agency Creative
Artists Agency Inc., is advising Matsushita in the talks. Mr.
Ovitz served as an adviser to Sony in its purchase of
Columbia, and Columbia at one point tried to recruit Mr.
Ovitz to run the studio. However the two sides couldn't agree
on terms. Rumors that Mr. Ovitz has since been interested in
leading an acquisition attempt for MCA have been circulating
in Hollywood for months.
   An assistant to Mr. Ovitz said he was traveling and
unreachable. MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg didn't return
phone calls and a secretary in his office said the company
wouldn't comment on rumors. In Japan, a Matsushita spokesman
said he didn't have any immediate comment.
   MCA has long been the subject of speculation that it would
merge with another company, such as Paramount Communications
Inc., or be acquired. But MCA has backed away from merger
talks before, notably with RCA Corp. before it was acquired
by General Electric Co. The talks stumbled, partly over
management questions.
   MCA's longtime chairman, Lew Wasserman, owns about 7% of
the shares and with other officers has voting control over an
additional 11.6%. If MCA does agree to a transaction with
Matsushita, it's always possible that another bidder might
try to make a run at the company, much as Paramount's failed
attempt to bust up the merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc.
   Any transaction would have to have the blessing of Mr.
Wasserman, 77 years old. The people with knowledge of the
talks said that that unlike Sony, which put in new management
after buying Columbia, Matsushita wants to keep MCA
management in place. Where Mr. Ovitz would fit in, if at all,
under such a scenario, is unclear.
   Despite mounting industry concerns over the growing
foreign control of U.S. entertainment companies, one
executive who knows Mr. Wasserman believes he might be
receptive to a Matsushita bid because he has become
increasingly convinced of the advantages of global reach and
might. "He really believes that to survive in the next
century, you will have to be a monumental-size company," the
executive added.
   Entertainment industry observers say that Matsushita has
been looking for a U.S. entertainment acquisition for some
time, and like Sony, looked at both Columbia and at MGM/UA
Communications Co.
   In MCA, Matsushita would be acquiring an entertainment
empire with interests in motion pictures, television, theme
parks, book publishing through Putnam Publishing Group, real
estate and movie theaters through its 49% interest in
Cineplex Odeon Corp. Its film library is one of Hollywood's
largest and most valuable, containing not only Universal
Pictures' own films such as "Jaws" and "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial," but Paramount's pre-1948 library and a
host of TV series. With assets like these, analysts in the
past have estimated the asset value of the company at $100 a
share.
   Mr. Wasserman, the elder statesman of Hollywood for years,
helped build up the company from a small booking agency
started by Chicago opthamologist Jules Stein. Though Mr.
Sheinberg runs the company on a day-to-day basis, Mr.
Wasserman remains actively involved. Analysts have speculated
for years whether Mr. Wasserman would sell the company, and
the stock was subject to the same morbid "death watch" as
other companies that have aging chairmen. When Mr. Wasserman
entered the hospital for surgery in 1987, the stock shot up
from $49 a share to $62.
   MCA has an agreement with Nippon Steel to explore theme
park ventures in Japan, and a co-venture with British-based
Rank Organisation to explore a theme park in England or
France to add to its $650 million Universal Studios Florida,
which opened in Orlando last June, and its older studio tour
adjacent to MCA headquarters in Universal City, Calif.
Although the park has been plagued with malfunctioning rides
and resulting bad publicity in its first few months, analysts
believe it will be profitable in the long run.
   Matsushita has indirectly made a small foray into
Hollywood already through its 51%-owned Victor Co. of Japan
unit (known as JVC), which last year agreed to invest $100
million in a joint venture it formed with Hollywood producer
Lawrence Gordon, to develop, produce and finance motion
pictures.
   Executives, lawyers and bankers have been shuttling back
and forth between Hollywood and Tokyo recently as a growing
number of Japanese firms express interest in investing in the
movie business. Earlier this month, for example, Walt Disney
Co. formed a $100 million joint venture to market and produce
movies with Interscope Communications and Nomura Babcock &amp;
Brown, which is 80%-owned by Tokyo-based Nomura Securities.
   Although Sony Corp. is better known to Americans and
Europeans, Osaka-based Matsushita has sales more than double
Sony's. It has 42,000 employees to Sony's 17,000.
   While Sony has always enjoyed a reputation for creativity,
Matsushita's forte has been manufacturing skills. In Japan,
where Sony is seen as an upstart post-World War II company,
Matsushita is a big player in the business establishment. Its
founder, the late Konosuke Matsushita, was one of Japan's
corporate folk heroes, and its domestic marketing power is
formidable. It has a retail network of some 25,000 stores.
   Unlike Sony, which pioneered such products as the Walkman,
Matsushita has virtually no innovations to its name. It got
ahead playing to a prototypically sort of Japanese strength:
Anything anyone else makes, Matsushita can make better -- and
cheaper. In fact, Japanese used to jokingly refer to the
company as Maneshita, or copycat. If, a year after Sony's
acquisition of Columbia, Matsushita buys MCA, the Maneshita
joke might be heard again.
   But if Columbia is a good fit for Sony, a similar logic
would make MCA a good fit for Matsushita. Video equipment
generally accounts for about a fifth of Matsushita's sales,
and VCRs in particular account for 48% of the sales of JVC.
   MCA would also fit in with Matsushita's
internationalization drive. Labor shortages in Japan and a
protectionist backlash in the U.S. and Europe are pushing
Matsushita, along with many other Japanese companies, to
shift production overseas.
   Matsushita grinds out steady but unspectacular earnings
increases year after year. Its net income in the fiscal year
ended March 31 was 235.56 billion yen ($1.74 billion), an
increase of 10.4% over the previous year. But the company
hasn't made any flashy acquisitions or announced any bold new
strategies.
   Like many Japanese, Matsushita executives profess to be
squeamish about the takeover game. "I don't like the word
M&amp;A; it implies the buying and selling of companies," a top
Matsushita official said recently. If Matsushita makes an
acquisition, it would do it for some nonfinancial reason,
such as obtaining technology, the official said.
