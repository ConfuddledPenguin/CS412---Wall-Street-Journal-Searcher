   Lufthansa AG's charter airline unit said it placed a firm
order for 17 new aircraft valued at over 2 billion German
marks ($1.27 billion) from Boeing Co. Specific terms of the
transaction weren't disclosed.
   Condor Flugdienst G.m.b.H. said the acquisition of nine
Boeing 757-200 aircraft and eight long-range 767-300 planes
is Condor's largest order to date. A company spokesman said
the purchase is in line with the airline's fleet expansion
and overhaul program.

   Condor currently operates a fleet of 22 aircraft, of which
three are from McDonnell Douglas Corp., three are from Airbus
Industrie, while seven are Boeing 757-200s and nine are
Boeing 737-300 aircraft.
   The spokesman said Lufthansa, a 51% state-owned West
German flag carrier, will acquire Condor's Airbus planes next
year as Boeing replacements arrive. Condor will take delivery
of the new aircraft through the middle of 1995.
