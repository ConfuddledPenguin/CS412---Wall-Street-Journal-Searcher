   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co., trying to shore up profits amid
an industrywide sales decline, is raising prices on some of
its highest volume cars by reducing the cash rebates to
consumers.
   Ford cut the rebate on its 1991 Taurus, Sable,
Thunderbird, Cougar, Tempo and Topaz models to $500 from the
previous $750. The rebate on the Ford Crown Victoria was cut
to $500 from $1,000.

   The auto maker also totally eliminated the rebates to
consumers for the purchase of any of its 1990 models.
Instead, Ford said it will offer incentives on those cars to
dealers. Dealers may then use the money to cut the price to
showroom shoppers, boost local advertising or simply to
sweeten their own profits on the vehicles.
   The rebate changes take effect Thursday and are set to run
through Dec. 11.
   The Ford action appears to be a bold, and perhaps risky,
move to staunch the continuing rise in buyer-incentive
outlays, which have hit record levels this year. In the
second quarter, for example, Ford spent an average $1,050 per
vehicle on buyer incentives, compared with only about $600 a
vehicle a year earlier.
   But Ford's move is risky because its two largest
competitors, General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Co., have
been particularly aggressive in using incentives recently. GM
is the only Big Three auto maker to avoid a drop in
car-market share this year, and Toyota has a record 8.8%
market share in the first eight months of 1990. Should Ford
wind up losing market share this year, it will be the
company's first such decline since 1986.
   But Ford appears to be more worried by the plunge in its
earnings than by the erosion in its U.S. market share. Partly
because of incentive outlays, Ford's second quarter net
income plunged 45% to $770.7 million, or $1.67 a share. Some
analysts say Ford may post a loss for its U.S. auto
operations in the third quarter, although the company
wouldn't comment on that yesterday.
   A spokesman for GM, traditionally the industry's pricing
leader, said the auto maker will study Ford's pricing move
before it responds, if at all.
   The conflicting desires to boost market share and earnings
have caused Ford to waffle on pricing strategy in recent
months. In July, Ford initially said it would boost base
prices by 4% to 5% on most of its 1991 models. But seven
weeks later the auto maker scaled back many of those
increases to less than 3%.
   Analysts said Ford also could change its mind about its
latest pricing move. The new program "sounds like an
experiment to see what would happen to sales if incentives
weren't as generous," surmised Ronald Glantz, an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "It's an experiment
that can be quickly ended if sales decline," he added.
   Ford characterized yesterday's move as a step away from
incentives. "We've been saying all along that we would like
to get out of the incentive business, but that just hasn't
happened," a Ford spokesman said. "This could be construed as
a step in that direction."
   Ford's dealers, who criticized direct consumer incentives
as being too complicated, applauded the new program. Dealers
said yesterday's move will simplify the cash-back incentive
programs on the 1991 models, and give dealers a stronger
marketing role in clearing out the 1990s.
   "It's basically an answer to the dealers," said Craig
Kapson, general sales manager of Jordan Ford in Mishawaka,
Ind. "They've made it so that the dealer can negotiate with
the customer."
   The new incentive plan, like the old one, offers discount
finance rates as an alternative to rebates. It's also similar
to the old program in another respect: It doesn't offer any
consumer incentives on Ford's most profitable vehicles. Those
are the Ford Explorer, a four-door Jeep-like vehicle, and the
Lincoln luxury cars. Sales of those vehicles have been
strong.
