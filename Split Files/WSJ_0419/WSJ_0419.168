   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Savin Corp. said its top marketing
executive, Brian Merriman, was named president, succeeding
William T. Smith, who will become vice chairman and remain
chief operating officer.
   The appointments are effective May 16.

   The 52-year-old Mr. Merriman is executive vice president,
sales and marketing, at the marketer of copiers and facsimile
equipment, a post once held by Mr. Smith, 48.
   Savin credited Mr. Merriman with fostering closer ties
between the parent's sales organization and both independent
and company-owned sales offices. The executive vice
president's position will remain vacant for now, a
spokeswoman said.
   Separately, Savin declared a dividend on its Series A
preferred shares, payable May 1 to stock of record April 27.
   A proposal that shareholders approved last month allowed
Savin to pay the Series A dividend and arrearages with common
shares. Thus, Savin will issue 415,000 common shares to pay
the current dividend and about 7.5 million additional shares
to eliminate arrearages since November 1985. This means each
Series A share will receive about 1.6 common shares as a
current dividend plus 28.5 shares to cure the arrearages.
   Savin has 132 million common shares and 263,709 Series A
shares outstanding.
   At a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for
tomorrow, Savin will announce the results of further
balloting on four of eight proposals that didn't pass
previously. With the proposals, the company is asking holders
for more flexibility to pay dividends and for the right to
award certain options.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Savin shares closed at 25 cents, unchanged.
