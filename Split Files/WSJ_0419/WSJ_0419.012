   WASHINGTON -- U.S. official reserve assets rose $2.13
billion in March to $76.3 billion, the Treasury Department
said.
   Last month's rise followed a $1.33 billion decline in
reserve assets in February, the department said.

   U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
Special Drawing Rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S. reserve position, or its ability to draw foreign
currencies, at the IMF.
   The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased
$2.51 billion in March to $46.42 billion, while its gold
reserves were virtually unchanged at $11.06 billion.
   U.S. holdings of IMF Special Drawing Rights last month
fell $124 million to $10.09 billion, and its reserve position
at the IMF dropped $258 million to $8.73 billion.
