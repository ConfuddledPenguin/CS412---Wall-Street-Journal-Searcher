   Brierley Investments Ltd. said it applied to New Zealand's
Commerce Commission to acquire a majority interest in Telecom
Corp., the state-owned monopoly telephone company that the
government plans to sell to reduce debt.
   Bob Matthew, chief executive officer of Brierley, said the
company's bid for Telecom may involve foreign partners.

   "While Brierley Investments may well seek in its own right
to acquire a significant shareholding in Telecom, we are also
having discussions with a number of overseas parties who have
a genuine interest in investing in Telecom," he said.
   Earlier Wednesday the government said it has accepted a
number of parties as suitable potential bidders for shares in
Telecom, and will be giving them special access to
information about Telecom to help in valuations of the
company.
   But the government said it won't be identifying any of the
potential bidders or detailing the timing of the sale
process.
   Foreign buyers will be restricted to 49.9% of Telecom
shares.
