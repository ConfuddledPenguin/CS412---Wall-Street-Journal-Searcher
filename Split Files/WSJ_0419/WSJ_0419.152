   CALGARY, Alberta -- Shell Canada Ltd. said it withdrew as
a 16.66% equity partner in the proposed $580 million Altamont
gas pipeline, citing conflicting contractual obligations with
Altamont rival Pacific Gas Transmission Co, a unit of Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco.
   Analysts said the loss of Shell Canada strengthens the
position of Pacific Gas, which has proposed a competing $1.2
billion expansion of its Alberta-to-California pipeline
system.

   Pacific Gas has secured conditional contracts covering all
of its proposed additional pipeline capacity. The expansion
would allow the concern to move each day an additional 755
million cubic feet to California and 148 million cubic feet
to the Pacific Northwest.
   Altamont still has about 200 million cubic feet a day of
uncommitted space on its proposed pipeline, a spokeswoman
said. Its sponsors, led by a unit of Houston-based Tenneco
Inc. with a 40% interest, plan to transport as many as 700
million cubic feet of gas a day by late 1993 on their system.
It would extend from Alberta to Wyoming, where it would
connect with a separate Wyoming-to-California pipeline also
backed by Tenneco.
   Altamont said its remaining sponsors, including
Petro-Canada Inc., Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., a unit of
Chicago-based Amoco Corp., and Entech Inc., a subsidiary of
Montana Power Co., will absorb Shell Canada's interest.
Petro-Canada and Amoco Canada are major Calgary-based gas
producers.
