   WASHINGTON -- Historic agreements between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union on Germany, strategic missiles and the
withdrawal of the Red Army from Eastern Europe seemed all but
assured in the early weeks of 1990. And then tiny Lithuania,
a Baltic state forcibly absorbed after the 1939 Nazi-Soviet
pact, declared its independence.
   The Soviet Union, after acquiescing in the dismemberment
of its Eastern European empire, now wants to slow down the
train of change. With the prospect of a Soviet blockade
threatening Lithuania's survival, President Bush has an
unenviable choice: support for the Lithuanian people
asserting a cherished American right of self-determination,
or support for Soviet President Gorbachev and the agenda of
historic changes he seems willing to negotiate with the White
House.

   This agonizing dilemma turned more acute yesterday, when
Lithuanian officials reported that the Soviets have followed
through on their threats to shut off the supply of oil to the
Baltic republic. The Soviets also have threatened to cut off
natural gas supplies. Last night, the administration was
scrambling to verify the report of the oil cutoff, but an
official cautioned that even if it is confirmed, the U.S.
won't necessarily retaliate immediately. He said the Soviets
could reverse themselves.
   Lithuania has created deep tension between what Mr. Bush
wants to do and what events might force him to do: Impose
sanctions against the Kremlin for economically strangling the
Lithuanians. More than that, the issue pits some of the
Republican Party's most vocal conservatives against Mr. Bush
and his moderate supporters, whose first priority is to
support Mr. Gorbachev.
   To a surprising degree, the American people seem
overwhelmingly on the side of Mr. Gorbachev and the Bush
administration's efforts to avoid a fight over Lithuania.
Even if the Soviet Union violently suppresses Lithuania's bid
for independence, the American public opposes canceling next
month's planned summit talks between George Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev -- by a stunning 61% to 31%,
according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
   A surprisingly similar number of Americans think Mr. Bush
"shouldn't get involved" by recognizing Lithuania. They would
rather the U.S. stay on good terms with Moscow than support
the republic's bid to secede.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Bush appears to feel he may be forced to
do something to support the Lithuanians, even at the risk of
undermining Mr. Gorbachev and the chances for historic deals.
If Mr. Gorbachev presses the fuel embargo even further, the
administration has reluctantly concluded it would have to
hold up new trade pacts with the Soviets that Mr. Bush
ballyhooed at the Malta summit. And if the Soviets go so far
as to use force in the breakaway republic, the summit or the
arms control talks would probably be called off.
   The Lithuania crisis seems to have forced Mr. Gorbachev to
the right on arms-control issues as well. The Soviet military
apparently has forced an end to new concessions by Moscow in
the negotiations, at least for now. And if the new hard line
can't be overcome next month, when Secretary of State James
Baker flies to Moscow for crucial pre-summit talks, the
prospect of a summit deal could vanish.
   "Things have suddenly gotten much tougher," says Marshall
Goldman of Harvard's Russian Research Center. "Until now,
George Bush has had nothing but good news from Moscow. He's
been like an outfielder who just sticks out his glove and the
ball falls in. Now he has to chase those balls hard to catch
them."
   For now, the administration's goal is to keep focused on
the historic changes now within reach: deep arms cuts by
Moscow and plans for German unity and Eastern European
independence. The administration is determined not to allow
Lithuania to throw the process off track. So even if the
administration feels compelled to respond to a Soviet
crackdown by imposing sanctions, it will aim to make them as
minimal and cosmetic as possible.
   For instance, now that the Soviets have moved to cut off
fuel supplies, the U.S. probably will apply sanctions only in
the trade and economic area, leaving intact the chance of
achieving more far-reaching agreements on arms and political
reform of the Communist bloc. The trade pacts were in
jeopardy anyway because the Soviet government still hasn't
passed a law liberalizing emigration, long a key U.S.
condition for trade concessions.
   Meanwhile, administration officials are campaigning on
Capitol Hill and with reporters to convince people that the
arms-control deals are advantageous to the U.S., and
shouldn't be sacrificed to Lithuania. "Our policy toward the
Soviet Union is shaped by what is in the interest of the
United States of America," Secretary of State James Baker
told Congress yesterday.
   Moreover, America's European allies agree with American
public sentiment on Lithuania. The allies are pushing Mr.
Bush to keep broader superpower ties on schedule. Just this
week, Mr. Bush met with a few senators just back from a visit
to Moscow and hinted that he is getting pressure from
America's allies not to let Baltic unrest push the
superpowers off their track.
   Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker sense no public pressure for them
to do more, and they avidly follow poll readings on the
subject. The new Journal/NBC News survey will only reinforce
that feeling.
   "How do I account for the polls that suggest that we
should somehow not get involved in the question of the
Baltics?" Mr. Baker asks rhetorically. "I suppose that some
of it is a recognition on the part of the American people
that we have a lot of interests at stake here that are very
important to the United States of America."
   Washington bureaucrats have grown accustomed to having
ringside seats for wrangling between officials from the White
House and the State and Defense Departments over how to
handle basic superpower relations. But in this case, they are
surprised by the lack of debate. Administration officials
from often-combative agencies insist there isn't any
high-level internal challenge to their strategy of minimizing
the Lithuania issue.
   When some hawkish midlevel Pentagon aides recently
suggested that the administration should prepare to send
material assistance -- petroleum products or hard currency --
to Lithuania, the idea was slapped down. Indeed, some
officials felt the president went too far by publicly saying
last weekend that the threat of a fuel cutoff left him
"deeply disturbed."
   Such sentiments have produced a profound ambivalence
within the administration about the Lithuanians' pursuit of
independence from the Soviet Union, a cause the U.S.
technically supports. Nowhere was that ambivalence more
apparent than a few days ago, when Mr. Bush met privately
with leaders of the Baltic-American community.
   The Baltic-Americans, who had been clamoring for weeks for
a White House meeting, were delighted when Mr. Bush flatly
declared at the outset Lithuanian independence is inevitable.
"I underline the word inevitable, because that is the word
the president used," John Genys, a representative of the
Lithuanian American Council, says.
   But that happiness ebbed when Mr. Bush was pressed to
recognize Lithuania's government. The president responded
that he needed to move carefully and "sort out the
information" from Lithuania before taking such a step.
   Mr. Bush has made it apparent that he wants to pursue his
careful policy with discipline. Two weeks ago, without any
announcement, he sent Mr. Gorbachev a signal that he wouldn't
let the crisis in Lithuania block warmer ties, by immediately
agreeing to Soviet observer status in world trade talks.
Earlier, Mr. Bush had insisted that such status be denied
until 1991.
   The united moderate front has dismayed hard-liners. Frank
Gaffney, a former Reagan administration Pentagon aide who
heads the Center for Security Policy, says, "I'm firmly
convinced that nobody who matters is pressing inside the
administration to be tougher. The folks who brought you the
puerile sanctions against China are the same people who will
try to limit the response on Lithuania."
   Mr. Gaffney's group has called the potential trade talk
delays "Potemkin sanctions" and proposed instead a much
harsher list of economic measures, including fuel aid for
Lithuania and a cutoff of existing energy cooperation with
Moscow. But he admits that, on a recent speaking tour around
the country, he found that "nobody is talking about this
issue." He adds that "the American people have a tradition of
xenophobia, isolation and indifference" to foreign events.
   The real problem for the Bush White House lies inside the
Soviet Union. There, Mr. Gorbachev is assuring visitors he
wants to avoid a clash over Lithuania as much as Mr. Bush
does. But he has shown little sign that he knows how to do
so.
   When a group of American politicians saw Mr. Gorbachev in
the Kremlin last week, the Soviet president hinted he's
prepared over time to deal with Lithuania's quest for
independence -- but only on his terms. "He indicated that if
the Lithuanians want a divorce that they are entitled to
one," says Sen. Jim Sasser (D., Tenn.). But the Soviet leader
added that "even when you get a divorce, you're required to
go to court for a settlement."
   Behind that reasonable-sounding mien, the American
visitors sensed a seething anger. Mr. Gorbachev twice told
the senators Lithuania's independence-minded leaders have put
everyone in a "stupid situation." He mocked the Lithuanians'
political skills.
   That irritation is privately shared in the White House and
State Department, where there is a widespread belief that
Moscow will eventually let Lithuania secede, and that the
current confrontation might have been avoided by defter
handling by leaders of the Baltic republic.
   Still, if Moscow enforces draconian measures against
Lithuania, some sanctions will be imposed. "If you see
videotapes on TV of little children freezing or starving,
this administration will turn on a dime," says a senior
official at State.
   The administration could retaliate by cutting off talks on
several economic issues, including trade, taxes, civil
aviation, investments, and maritime transport. Officials had
hoped for agreements on the issues by the May 30 summit.
   The White House portrays all those negotiations as
primarily beneficial to the Soviets, at least in the short
run. In contrast, officials say, the talks on conventional
and nuclear arms, and on Germany, promise to seal a historic
retreat of Soviet power and armed force in Europe, and are
squarely in the American interest.
   While the current dilemma mainly stems from Soviet actions
and attitudes, Harvard's Mr. Goldman says, "We could have
made things easier if we'd moved on trade months ago."
   He says such a gesture then would have given Mr. Gorbachev
a concession that might have helped damp both military
pressure and secessionist sentiment. "If we'd helped him
then, it might have postponed these kinds of crises," he
says. "Gestures at this point are very important to Mikhail
Gorbachev."
