   TSI Inc., Shoreview, Minn., lowered its estimate of
per-share profit for the year ended March 31 to about 80
cents from its earlier projection of 90 cents to 95 cents.
   The measuring device maker said it expects to report
fiscal 1990 sales of about $37 million, compared with $34.8
million in fiscal 1989, when the company had net income of
$1.9 million, or 75 cents a share. The company said results
for fiscal 1990 will be released in June.

   Leroy M. Fingerson, TSI president and chief executive
officer, attributed the lower-than-expected earnings to a
shortfall in sales, resulting from reduced order bookings in
the fourth quarter.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, TSI
dropped $1 to close at $10.50.
