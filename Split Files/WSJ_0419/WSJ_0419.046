   RICHMOND, Va. -- Media General Inc. reported a 77% drop in
first-quarter net income as operating profit declined sharply
in its newspaper and newsprint divisions.
   James S. Evans, president and chief executive officer,
said "although 1990 revenue growth is expected, the
uncertainty of the economy currently is clouding the earnings
outlook." But he added that the company sees "1990 and 1991
as the first rung on a new growth ladder, which will provide
a period of renewed growth and expansion."

   First-quarter net income fell to 2.7 million, or 10 cents
a share, from $11.9 million, or 46 cents a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 quarter included an after-tax gain of $5.7
million, or 22 cents a share, from the sale of a newsprint
recycling mill. Excluding the year-ago gain, profit was off
56%. Revenue fell slightly to $148 million from $149.3
million.
   Media General said newspaper profit fell 44%, reflecting
continued softness in national, retail and classified
advertising and consolidation in the retailing industry.
Newsprint profit dropped 38% because of heavy price-cutting
in a market plagued by overcapacity.
   Media General owns four daily newspapers and a 40%
interest in a company that owns 15 other dailies. It also
owns four television stations and two cable-TV properties and
has interests in three newsprint mills.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Media
General closed at $28.75, down 50 cents.
