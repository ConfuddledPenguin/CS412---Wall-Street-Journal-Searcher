   Your March 7 page-one article about the singles night at
the laundromat recalls a song I wrote in 1979 that I titled
"Queen of the Launderette." It would make an excellent
accompaniment to a sudsy wedding service.
   The song was:

   Verse I
                                                                                                       

   I went there in the evening at the closing of the day
   To do my weekly laundry and to wash my cares away,
   And there amid the washers was a girl I can't forget,
   The one I'll always think of as my
   Queen of the Launderette.
                                                                                                       

   Chorus
                                                                                                       

   When she poured the detergent my wish became urgent
   To soft-soap my Queen of the Launderette.
   When she loaded the dryer, my heart was on fire
   For my Queen of the Launderette.
   Some may use smoke rings to summon a dream,
   But my sweetest mem'ries rise up with the steam.
   Oh, that I had her even now at my side
   But when she was finished she went out with the Tide;
   That's how I lost her, so I sit here and bawl
   For I loaned her a quarter and gave her my All;
   My Queen of the Launderette.
   Now my tears make it damper as I empty my hamper,
   My Queen of the Launderette.
                                                                                                       

   Verse II
                                                                                                       

   Oh the world is full of women with washing to be done,
   But in my secret sorrows there is really only one.
   And now among the soapsuds there's a
   face that haunts me yet,
   The one I'll always think of as my
   Queen of the Launderette.

   Unfortunately, this gem was never set to music. Marvin
Hamlisch, are you there?
