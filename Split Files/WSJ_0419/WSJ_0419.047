   Paul Russell's first novel, "The Salt Point" (Dutton, 210
pages, $18.95), might have been written on a dare. It's
saddled with a hero who is, superficially anyway, a cliche --
he's a gay hairdresser named Anatole. Its setting, the Hudson
River burg of Poughkeepsie, is a byword for exurban dullness.
And it's got a plot that might make many readers
uncomfortable. Let's just say it involves Anatole, his
friends Lydia and Chris -- both of whom, like him, are
pushing 30 and leading romantically uncommitted,
professionally aimless lives -- and a remote, alluring
18-year-old lad named Leigh who enters their world and
changes it forever.
   Mr. Russell has taken these materials, however, and
created a wise, tender and remarkably engrossing story about
human affections -- their power and illogic, their
preciousness and unpredictability -- and about how those
affections flare and fare at the "salt point."

   What, you ask, is the salt point? As Chris explains, it's
the ever-shifting place where the Hudson turns salty and
technically becomes an estuary. It serves here as a metaphor
for the equivocal stage of life at which Anatole and his
friends find themselves: They're at the far edge of youth,
torn between the attractions of adolescence and the
imperatives of adulthood, forced to confront their childlike
tendencies to mistake irresponsibility for innocence,
detachment for freedom, maturity for corruption, commitment
for confinement.
   Yet there are important differences among the characters,
and one of the most impressive things about this book is the
deftness and impartiality with which Mr. Russell moves from
one point of view to another, seeing each character through
the others' eyes and disinterestedly rendering their
discrepant readings of the same circumstances. Mr. Russell
speaks of the "forces mysterious as weather" that rule the
human heart -- and his mindfulness of these forces, and of
the rich ambiguity of all human relations, makes his novel
extremely credible.
   Most of it, that is. For Mr. Russell interpolates several
contrived flashbacks to account for his characters'
aimlessness and fear of commitment, and works in a number of
pretentious references to atomic apocalypse. But these
touches of simplistic motivation and baby nihilism are the
exception in a book conspicuous for its genuineness and
humanity. Mr. Russell knows that in the great scheme of
things "nobody matters much"; his accomplishment is to remind
us, with surprising poignancy, that the miracle of life is
how very much people can mean to each other.

   Like "The Salt Point," Christopher Osborn's lyrical,
meditative "A Sense of Touch" (Harper &amp; Row, 282 pages,
$18.95) is a debut novel about concupiscence and commitment
featuring a thirtyish gay protagonist. Robert is a London
pianist whose first professional concert provides the novel's
structural framework: While he plays, we share his thoughts
and memories, as well as those of his parents and friends in
the audience.
   These thoughts and memories are largely carnal. While
Robert contemplates the ecstasies and frustrations of his
promiscuous sex life -- which inspires some of the book's
most impassioned prose -- and recalls his brief affair, a
year earlier, with an attractive, mendacious young man named
Johnny (who has much in common with Mr. Russell's Leigh),
Robert's parents ponder the tedium of their marriage.
   The message is clear: Monogamy can be deadening; sex with
a multiplicity of virtual strangers can be life-enhancing, a
form of "pure communication" with one's fellow man. Even
during his liaison with Johnny, Robert "has no desire to
intrude, to absorb or be absorbed; he is aware of Johnny as a
quite separate life; and this awareness, which is the
opposite of possession, is enriching."
   Mr. Osborn writes well -- sensitively, perceptively, even
beautifully -- about these matters. Yet he fails to convey a
vivid sense of the life of which Robert's libidinous
encounters are, after all, only a part. Robert's scenes with
family and friends seem odd and fragmentary: Often one isn't
sure what point Mr. Osborn seeks to make about these
relationships. Nor -- for all his immense efforts -- does Mr.
Osborn convince one for a moment that Robert's sexual habits
are anything but hollow and grubby and sad. On the contrary,
his novel inadvertently reminds one that meaningful human
communication -- like a masterly performance of an unfamiliar
piano piece -- calls for something more than skilled
extemporaneous virtuosity.
