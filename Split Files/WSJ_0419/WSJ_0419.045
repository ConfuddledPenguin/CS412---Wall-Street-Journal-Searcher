   In a Gorilla Suit Just Didn't Cut It

   In Corvallis, Ore., the U.S. Forest Service has clipped
the wings of what it believes is a highly controversial
political figure -- Woodsy the Owl.
   Woodsy, the civic-minded sidekick of Smokey Bear, has
spent the better part of two decades encouraging the public
to "Give a Hoot-Don't Pollute." But officials at the Siuslaw
National Forest near here decided they didn't want
elementaryschool students to confuse a Forest Service
employee wearing a 5 1/2-foot "Woodsy" costume with the
real-life Spotted Owl.

   The living bird is at the center of political debate in
the Pacific Northwest because it needs old-growth forests to
survive. Environmentalists want to protect the owl by
preserving large tracts of land, including some in the
Siuslaw National Forest. Loggers and millworkers, meanwhile,
say such action might preserve the birds but would threaten
their own jobs.
   "Parents of some of the kids could have their lives and
livelihoods affected by decisions about the Spotted Owl,"
says Norm Hesseldahl, a spokesman for the Forest Service. "We
didn't want to upset people."
   So the Forest Service mascots won't be making their usual
joint appearances in kindergarten through second-grade
classrooms in Benton County, which has a population of
69,000. Woodsy has been caged for the rest of the year, while
Smokey goes it alone.
   Woodsy's woodshed treatment might not be a bad idea in
view of the strong feelings the Spotted Owl raises, says Rod
Harvey, principal of the elementary school in Philomath, Ore.
"Since our job is to educate children from both sides," he
says, "we try to stay clear of getting involved in
controversy."
   But the character's no-show has prompted grumbling from at
least one Corvallis elementary school.
   Woodsy was scheduled to be the headliner at Hoover
Elementary School's Earth Day celebration this week. And when
Earth Week celebrations coordinator Terry Sullivan heard
about Woodsy's grounding, the second-grade teacher canceled
plans for Smokey's appearance, too.
   "These are just primary-aged children," Ms. Sullivan says.
"I think it's pretty unlikely they would even associate
Woodsy Owl and the Spotted Owl."
