   Lehigh Portland Cement Co. agreed to a $5 million
settlement of National Labor Relations Board charges that it
engaged in unfair labor practices, the NLRB said.
   The settlement covers back pay for members of the
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the board said,
and stems from a case that was begun in 1984. Lehigh, based
in Allentown, Pa., is a subsidiary of Heidelberger Zement
A.G., Heidelberg, West Germany.

<TEXT>
   The NLRB concluded in November 1987 that Lehigh violated
labor law by putting contract proposals into effect
unilaterally, thereby changing the terms of an expired
collective-bargaining agreement without first bargaining to
an impasse with the union. The company and the union
eventually agreed to a new contract in October 1988.
   Under the settlement, the NLRB's Philadelphia regional
office will determine how the back wages will be distributed
among approximately 1,200 employees at the company's nine
plants.
