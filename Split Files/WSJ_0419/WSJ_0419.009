   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Using a potent new technique to alter
genes in animals, scientists here developed a strain of
mutant mice that are expected to answer basic questions about
the immune system.
   The work represents the latest advance in research on
"transgenic" animals, which contain artificially inserted
foreign genes. During the past few years, many transgenic
animals have been developed using a technique in which
scientists add or randomly knock out genes. Now, however, a
new technique is emerging that enables researchers to knock
out or replace specific genes. The development of the new
mouse strain represents one of the first applications of this
more powerful way to make "designer" animals.

   Scientists are racing to use this new technique to mimic
human genetic diseases in mice and to investigate functions
of specific genes. Among other things, the work promises to
shed light on how certain genes predispose people to cancer
and how inherited diseases might be treated or prevented. It
also throws into sharper relief the issues raised by
scientists' growing power to manipulate genes in animals.
   "We're bringing things into the orbit of manipulation that
previously weren't at our disposal," said Stuart Newman, an
embryologist at New York Medical College who has written
about ethical issues in transgenic animal research. "We have
to be aware of possible pain, distress and physical
derangement in transgenic animals and balance that against
the benefits" of research on them.
   The new strain of mutant mice were developed by scientists
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead
Institute, a biomedical research establishment affiliated
with MIT. They deactivated a gene indirectly responsible for
production of a crucial immune-system protein, called MHC-1.
The mice look normal, but they lack both MHC-1 and killer T
cells, said Rudolf Jaenisch, who led the research with MIT's
David Raulet.
   Many researchers believe one function of the T cells is to
kill cells that turn cancerous. Scientists now can
investigate that theory by studying whether the mutant mice
are prone to cancer.
   The work, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature,
also promises to advance organ-transplant technology. MHC-1
occurs in each cell of normal animals, serving as a flag to
the immune system that the cell belongs to "self" and
shouldn't be attacked as a foreign invader. Cells from
different animals have different MHC-1 molecules. Thus, when
cells are transplanted from one animal to another, the
recipient's immune system senses and attacks them as aliens,
causing transplant rejection.
   Tissues from the mice without MHC-1 may not be detectable
as foreign by the immune system, hence may not be subject to
rejection when transplanted. If so, scientists someday may be
able to develop similar tissues without MHC-1 to use as
transplants that wouldn't be rejected, Mr. Jaenisch said.
   The new technique springs from research in the early 1980s
led by British scientist Martin Evans, who showed that
foreign genes could be placed in mouse embryos at an early
state of development. Later, other researchers developed ways
to alter specific genes in the embryonic cells. Recently,
scientists have begun producing strains of mice that can pass
such altered genes to their offspring.
   The new technique "eventually will supplant
micro-injection," the less-powerful method now usually used
to make transgenic animals, said Oliver Smithies, a
University of North Carolina researcher who helped develop
the new method. Micro-injection involves placing foreign
genetic material with microscopic instruments into newly
fertilized embryos. It has been used by a number of companies
trying to develop transgenic animals that grow faster, resist
disease or produce human drugs in their milk.
