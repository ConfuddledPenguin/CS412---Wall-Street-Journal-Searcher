   Of all the statements that any knowledgeable person could
take issue with in your April 3 editorial "A National
Identity Card?" none is further from the truth than your
assertion that "INS Commissioner Gene McNary didn't shrink
from calling it a national I.D."
   Not only have I never "floated" such an idea, I am
strongly opposed to a national identity card. What I have
said is that Congress should consider just what the General
Accounting Office report called for: an improved verification
system to eliminate discrimination in hiring. This could
include something as simple as a phone verification using a
Social Security number, similar to what occurs every time you
or I use a credit card.

   Though your longstanding bias against any provisions that
forbid employers from hiring illegal aliens makes it
difficult for you to acknowledge the fact, that is
significantly different from a national identity card.
