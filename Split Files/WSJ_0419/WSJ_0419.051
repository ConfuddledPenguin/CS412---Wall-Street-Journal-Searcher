   NEW YORK -- Capital Cities/ABC Inc. reported first-quarter
net income climbed 28% as revenue rose 13% on the strength of
a 15% increase in its broadcast operations revenue.
   The broadcasting and publishing company posted net of
$106.3 million, or $6.08 a share, up from $82.7 million, or
$4.59 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $1.26 billion
from $1.12 billion. Broadcasting operating profit rose to
$200.5 million from $148.7 million, but publishing operating
profit eased to $24.3 million from $24.8 million.

   Revenue at the broadcast division, consisting of the
network and eight TV stations, advanced to $992.5 million
from $865.6 million, primarily because of strong advertising
demand and healthy ratings, except for its daytime schedule.
   Publishing revenue increased to $269.8 million from $254.9
million. The division consists of nine daily newspapers and
weeklies as well as shopping guides and specialty magazines.
   Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
one reason Capital Cities/ABC performed so well was that its
TV network, despite its second-place showing in the ratings,
continues to be demographically attractive to advertisers.
   "Unlike NBC, ABC hasn't had to do make-goods," he said,
referring to the industry practice of giving free commercial
time to advertisers when a show doesn't deliver the audience
size guaranteed to the sponsor.
   Mr. McAlpine said he anticipated a weak so-called up-front
market -- when ads are sold in advance of the 1990-91 TV
season. Despite that, Mr. McAlpine said, "ABC is in the best
position of any network." As previously reported, ABC
finished the 30-week 1989-90 prime-time season, which ended
Sunday, in second place, behind General Electric Co.'s
National Broadcasting Co. and ahead of CBS Inc.'s TV network.
   But ABC had the season's only hits of the three major
networks: "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Twin Peaks."
The only other hit is "The Simpsons" on Fox Broadcasting Co.,
a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Capital Cities/ABC closed at $539.375 a share, down $7.125.
