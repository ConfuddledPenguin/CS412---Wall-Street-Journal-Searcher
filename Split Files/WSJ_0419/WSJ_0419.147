   Asarco Inc. said it dropped a lawsuit against
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. over their 50-50 joint-venture
copper-mining research project.
   Asarco, which has interests in nonferrous metals and
specialty chemicals, filed the suit last month in New York
state Supreme Court challenging Freeport's plan to sell its
half-interest to Minorco S.A. as part of a broader
transaction involving the sale of a 61%-owned Freeport unit.
But before that transaction was completed at the end of
March, Freeport bought the venture stake from the unit for
$15 million, Freeport said.

   The Asarco suit alleged that if Minorco became its new
partner, it could harm the venture. Asarco was concerned that
Luxembourg-based Minorco's South African ties might
jeopardize the venture's federal funding.
   The purpose of the venture, the Santa Cruz Project near
Casa Grande, Ariz., is to test the feasibility of new
technology to extract copper from a deep underground deposit.
   In late February, Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co., a unit of New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Inc., agreed to be
acquired-along with its 50% stake in the Santa Cruz
Project-by Minorco for about $705 million in a $17-a-share
tender offer.
