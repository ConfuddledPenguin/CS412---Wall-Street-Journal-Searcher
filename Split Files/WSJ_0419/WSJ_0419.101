   HOUSTON -- USX Corp. may come up well short of raising the
$1.5 billion it hoped through an auction of oil and gas
properties -- a development that could fuel Carl Icahn's
campaign against company management.
   The bidding deadline passed at the end of March for the
reserves of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp., which USX put up for sale
last October. After examining the unit's data, many
oil-industry officials predicted the auction won't show the
strong bidding of other recent oil-property sales. They
doubted even whether the reserves, broken up into about a
half-dozen packages, would all be sold.

   It isn't known when USX will announce results of the sale.
Last year, Chairman Charles A. Corry said the sale would be
completed in the 1990 first quarter and yield $1.5 billion or
more. But yesterday, the company said it is premature to talk
about what it expects to receive or when. "We're still in
detailed negotiations with prospective buyers and the timing
of {any transactions} is uncertain," a company spokesman said
in Pittsburgh.
   Still, many oil men said they view the properties as fully
explored and containing too many small wells to warrant
payment of top dollar. "We just looked and walked," said the
chief executive of one integrated oil company, echoing the
attitude of a number of others. "We look for acquisitions
that have upside, or exploratory, potential and the Texas Oil
&amp; Gas properties generally don't meet that criteria."
   In addition, USX decided to retain for itself a vital
Texas Oil pipeline system linked to the gas reserves, which
further reduced bidders' interest, industry officials said.
   "Had this sale gone smoothly and gotten good dollars, it
might have blunted Icahn somewhat," said an acquisitions
specialist from a midsized oil company.
   Mr. Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has urged the
company to sell all its Texas Oil properties and spin off the
steel and oil businesses into separate corporations.
Shareholders are voting on the proposal at the annual meeting
May 7. Mr. Icahn declined to comment on signs the sale isn't
going well, other than to agree with oil experts that, "Texas
Oil &amp; Gas makes a very attractive package with the pipeline."
   If the sale doesn't look like it will live up to USX's
goal, the company is widely expected to hold off announcement
of results until after the annual meeting.
   But delays in completing the auction have already raised
questions about its progress and organization. "This is the
second or third time they've pushed this off," said Frederick
Leuffer, a securities analyst with CJ Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc.
   USX still could generate a strong result; sales prices of
many energy properties over the past two years have exceeded
expectations. However, one person familiar with the Texas Oil
sale predicted only a few pieces would wind up being sold,
bringing $500 million to $700 million. Others concurred.
   "I doubt anybody will buy the whole thing," said Arthur
Smith, president of John S. Herold Inc., a Greenwich, Conn.,
consulting and appraisal company. "The properties don't look
as good" as some others that have fetched surprisingly strong
prices, he said.
   In fact, USX seems to be setting the stage for a
disappointing outcome. "This is not a fire sale," a company
official told a group of institutional investors in New
Orleans just a few days after bids were due. "I don't think
you can assume we'll sell all the packages."
   Prospective bidders did express strong interest in at
least one region. "Our conclusion was that the
highest-quality properties were in the Arkoma package," said
an official who headed up a bidding team at a large oil
company. "Our expectation is that's going to go for a premium
price." Arkoma is a natural gas field in Oklahoma and
Arkansas that is currently one of the country's hottest
drilling areas.
   But the other packages are viewed as less desirable. "The
catch on the rest of them is that they were made up of a
whole bunch of low-producing wells and no concentration in
any particular fields," contended an investment banker who
examined them. The trend among large oil companies has been
to sell off smaller, disparate wells to reduce operating
costs.
   In addition, many of recent sales were bonanzas partly
because buyers thought the properties contained a lot of
undiscovered oil and gas. But Texas Oil has a reputation for
wringing as much as possible from its properties. "They don't
have much exploration potential attached to these
properties," maintained an official of another company. "They
tried to indicate there was some, but most of our fellows
didn't agree."
   Not selling the Texas Oil pipeline, which links many of
the gas wells to processing facilities and then to larger
pipelines, also hurt because any new owners of the wells can
transport their gas through that pipeline only. USX has "sort
of a monopoly in the gathering system," the investment banker
said.
   USX had hoped that by retaining the pipeline, it would be
able to cash in on any upturn in the natural gas market. USX
acquired Texas Oil in an exchange of stock valued at $3
billion in early 1986, as the energy industry was skidding
into a severe slump. Though oil prices have recovered, gas
prices have remained low, depressing the profitability of
Texas Oil. Moreover, the acquisition doubled the number of
USX shares outstanding.
