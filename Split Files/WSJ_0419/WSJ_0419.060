   CML Group Inc. said Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who
with Minstar Inc. holds a 14.9% stake in the company, dropped
a previously announced plan to wage a proxy fight to replace
CML's board.
   CML, Acton, Mass., said Mr. Jacobs decided against
pursuing the proxy fight after a meeting with company
officials in which the sportswear and recreation products
concern predicted healthy earnings and sales increases for
fiscal 1990 and 1991.

   Mr. Jacobs, whose earlier $25-a-share bid was rejected by
CML, stopped short of ruling out any future action on CML. He
said no standstill or other agreements have been reached with
CML.
   Mr. Jacobs noted that CML's forecast represents "quite a
difference from where they've been." He said CML, after
selling a number of businesses, "can focus on fewer
businesses without stretching beyond their means."
   Since Mr. Jacobs and Minstar, a Minneapolis company he
runs, bought their stake, CML has sold several businesses as
part of a restructuring. CML predicted earnings from
continuing operations of $1.90 to $2 a share in the fiscal
year ending July 31, although it will post a loss for the
year because of losses from discontinued operations. Sales in
the year will be about $275 million, up from $234.6 million.
   CML also predicted that earnings from operations will
increase to about $2.80 a share on increased sales of about
$318 million. CML said its growth will come in part from an
expansion of its Nature Co. stores and additions to its line
of NordicTrack exercise equipment.
   In the previous fiscal year, the company had a loss of
$5.5 million, or 85 cents a share, from continuing
operations. A loss from discontinued operations of $26.4
million resulted in a loss in the year of $31.9 million, or
$4.92 a share.
   In an agreement earlier this year between Mr. Jacobs and
CML and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Jacobs would have been permitted to solicit consents from
CML shareholders from April 18 to May 18, calling for a
special meeting to remove CML's board and replace it with a
slate committed to selling the company to the highest bidder.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CML
closed at $21.125 a share, down $1.125.
