   Your March 12 editorial "College Prices" bemoans college
tuition-rate increases, accuses U.S. colleges of significant
waste and exhorts them to pay attention to the forces of the
market. The editorial misleads on all counts. First, the
forces of the marketplace tell colleges that, if anything,
tuition should be rising more rapidly than it is. Rates of
return on college education have skyrocketed in recent years.
Students may pay more, but they are getting back even more in
higher income. Changes in the U.S. industrial structure away
from heavy manufacturing toward services, "inter alia", has
generated a shortage of high-paying blue-collar jobs and a
surplus of jobs requiring more-sophisticated analytical
skills. In 1973, the median income of a 30-year-old male
highschool graduate was 15% less than the income of a
30-year-old male college graduate. By 1987, the gap had
widened to 50%. College education, then, is one of the best
investments an 18-year-old can make. This, of course, is a
major reason why the share of college enrollments among the
relevant age cohort rose throughout the past decade despite
the tuition increases.
   Second, you suggest that professors' lives are too cozy.
You miss the point when you observe that professors at some
schools teach eight to 12 hours a week in the classroom.
Would we judge the work of a CEO by hours spent in the board
room? In addition to classroom hours, professors spend long
hours working with individual students, preparing for
lectures and seminars, attending meetings and doing research.
The average workweek is well over 40 hours. This is not to
say that certain professors don't take advantage of the
luxury of tenure. They do, and this is just as troubling to
those of us in academia as to the outside critics, but this
group is a small minority and surely has its analogues
elsewhere in society. It is difficult to understand how you
can believe that as a group professors are overpaid when
individuals in the private sector with similar levels of
skill and educational attainment receive salaries many times
higher. President Bush, to his credit, has noted the
problematic state of U.S. schools and the absolute necessity
of upgrading and enriching the entire educational system.
This can happen only if teacher salaries, at all levels, go
up appreciably and quickly.

   There remains the issue of making a college education
accessible to all income groups. Here the best solution is
simple. Rather than tinkering with the price of output as the
Justice Department investigation encourages (as well as
significantly pushing college operating costs), the
government would do well to make educational loans available
to all worthy applicants. The high rates of return to college
graduates would make this among the safer loans issued by our
financial institutions in recent years.

   I went to a state college (Frostburg), where I obtained a
good education. My professors were hard workers and their
classes were very interesting. Almost all of my professors
took an interest in my educational and professional future
after graduation. Now, I work as a librarian in a respectable
law firm.
   I cannot sympathize with parents who hold themselves
hostage to an expensive institution's tuition, because I know
that there is a bright alternative -- public higher
education.

   Your complaint that "too often it looks as if the schools
exist mainly for the benefit of the faculty" is both naive
and misguided. Are not the tenured faculty members the de
facto proprietors of educational institutions? Are not
enterprises, in a free-enterprise economy, run for the
benefit of their proprietors? Do you take seriously the
rhetoric of college and university administrators who pretend
to be motivated by charitable rather than self-interested
objectives? Do you think that the not-for-profit tax loophole
really means not for profit?
   Most important, what is your problem with the profit
motive? You suggest that similar tuition at similar
institutions is evidence of collusion. But the market for
educational services, with thousands of suppliers and free
entry, actually is highly competitive. Students, who apply in
large numbers and cherish admission, clearly regard an
education at even the elite colleges and universities that
charge the highest tuition to be a bargain. In fact, the
interesting question is why demand has not driven tuition
substantially higher. (The answer presumably is that an
excess of applicants enables colleges and universities to
perform a useful screening function.)
   The bottom line is that Adam Smith's invisible hand works.
All studies show that a higher education is the best
investment a family can make. The self-interest of suppliers
constrained by competition has given us, as you grudgingly
admit, "the best university system in the world."

   You use the terms "average workload" and "teaching load"
interchangeably. In order to clarify your meaning for me and,
perhaps, for other readers as well, let me pose the following
question.
   Does an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal have
an average workload calculated solely on the time his or her
fingers are actually inputting information via an electronic
keyboard, to the exclusion of time spent on research,
thinking, communicating, administering, meeting with
colleagues and perchance even drinking coffee?
