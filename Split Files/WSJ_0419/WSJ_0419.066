   Dream no more, would-be entrepreneurs. Wake up, flip on
late-night TV and tune in to Fran Tarkenton.
   On a show called, "Think and Grow Rich," the former pro
quarterback pitches cassettes, books and a "success/I.Q.
indicator" that will help you "succeed against any odds
imaginable." The materials, which together sell for $149.50,
are based on a 20-year study of Henry Ford, Alexander Graham
Bell, Thomas Edison and other great thinkers. Together, Mr.
Tarkenton says on a show produced by Guthy-Renker Corp. of
Palm Desert, Calif., they are "a master plan for achievement"
that has "created more millionaires than any program before
or since."

   "Think and Grow Rich" is part of a proliferation of
half-hour ads that hawk business opportunities, money-making
ideas and home-study courses or seminars on getting rich.
Many such programs, including "Think and Grow Rich," are
considered reputable, but some of them aren't. Scrutiny of
the industry is growing, and Congress and regulators are
beginning to crack down on deceptive advertisers.
   These program-length commercials first appeared in 1984
when the government lifted restrictions on the duration of TV
advertising. Now more than 2,000 such ads run each year and
the most successful shows can produce up to $30 million in
revenue annually. There is "How to Build a Fortune," "Making
It Happen" and "Creating Wealth." If "101 Ways to Get Cash
From the Government" doesn't suit you, try "Make as Much as
$200 an Hour for the Next 20 Years."
   Most of these ads show up on independent and cable-TV
between midnight and daybreak. Stations like them because
they can generate up to four times the revenue of, say,
reruns of "The Beverly Hillbillies." So do many of the
nation's insomniacs. At 2 a.m., untold numbers of restless
Americans who once counted sheep now ponder counting millions
of dollars; A.C. Nielsen Co. says 12% of U.S. households are
watching TV at that time.
   "The country has gone crazy for this stuff," says Thomas
Herwitz, vice president and general manager of WTTG-TV, an
independent station in Washington, D.C. "Americans see people
like Donald Trump making all this money and they want to,
too." Adds Doug Bernstein, a media buyer in Philadelphia, who
purchases time on TV stations for program-length ads: "If you
get on the air with the right show, it's a license to steal."
   Federal regulators, lawmakers and even members of the
industry itself say some advertisers are doing just that. "We
believe millions of dollars of fraud is directly attributable
to these kinds of ads," says Steve Jenning, staff director of
the House Small Business subcommittee on regulations. The
subcommittee is holding hearings aimed at increasing the
enforcement of laws governing claims by such advertisers as
well as requiring disclosures that the programs are
commercials.
   Mark Williams, who produces promotions for self-proclaimed
"success-merchant" Dave Del Dotto, says, "It's take your
money and run. There are some people in the industry who are
underhanded and rub off on our name even though we've never
done anything wrong."
   Regulators say the claims of some ads are misleading -- a
practice they are trying to curtail. In February, the Federal
Trade Commission charged in an administrative complaint that
Wayne T. Phillips falsely claimed in a half-hour ad that $33
billion in government grants is available to start small
businesses. The ad portrays Mr. Phillips as "America's
foremost expert on low-interest government loans and
government grants" and promotes his book, "How to Start Your
Business by Doing Business With the Government," which sells
for $49.95.
   In a suit filed in October in Maricopa County, Ariz.,
Superior Court, the state's attorney general also accused Mr.
Phillips, as well as Harold L. Morris, who is host of several
business-opportunity ads, of falsely claiming that consumers
could quickly obtain $25,000 in "free money" from the
government, even if they had bad credit. The suit, like the
FTC complaint, is pending.
   Mr. Phillips's lawyer, David Bosse, says the ad isn't
deceptive. Moreover, he says, only 5% to 6% of the 300,000
people who bought Mr. Phillips's book asked for a refund.
"There isn't one allegation of a hurt consumer who wanted
their money back and didn't get it," he adds. Mr. Morris's
attorney couldn't be reached.
   In a separate action this month, Twin Star Productions
Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., which derived 40% of its revenue
during the first nine months of 1989 from the sale of
products advertised on the show featuring Mr. Phillips,
settled FTC charges -- without admitting or denying them --
that it made false claims on three TV ads unrelated to Mr.
Phillips's show. The company and six of its officers,
including its chairman, Jerald Steer, agreed to pay over 18
months $1.5 million in redress to consumers. Twin Star plans
to pay $500,000 of that with proceeds from an initial public
stock offering it commenced in January.
   To people like Jeff Padden, a small-business advocate for
the governor of Michigan, the consequences of deceptive
business-opportunity ads are more far-reaching than financial
losses to people. In theory, such commercials should be
inspiring entrepreneurial spirit. Instead, they could
discourage it. "The real tragedy is that people spend time
chasing these rainbows," Mr. Padden says, "and when they
don't get what they have been led to expect, they don't go
any further. It damages the entrepreneurial climate."
   Except for their gushing testimonials and periodic breaks
for a direct sales pitch, these extra-long ads rarely look
like a typical commercial. "Wealth Without Risk," produced by
the Charles J. Givens Organization in Longwood, Fla., at
times appears to be a segment of "Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous." The only difference: the rich and famous person, in
this case, is none other than Mr. Givens.
   There he is riding with a beautiful blond woman in a white
Lincoln limousine or stepping with her aboard a yacht named
the Great Adventure. Later Mr. Givens and his companion sip
champagne while soaking in a poolside Jacuzzi. Now the couple
are dining by candlelight inside what he says is his $2
million Florida estate.
   Don't think Mr. Givens was born into such wealth. When he
was 13 years old, viewers are told, his father left home, the
family business went bankrupt, the tax man hauled away his
possessions and his mother became an alcoholic.
   But Mr. Givens, says the ad, turned his life around with
strategies he devised in personal finance, tax reduction and
investing -- strategies now available to anyone who, for
$399, becomes a member of his organization and buys his
audio-cassette library of 300 presumably riskless ways to
increase your wealth.
   Mr. Del Dotto's program-length promotion, "Financial
Freedom and Wealth Building in America Today," looks like a
talk show. It is taped in Hawaii, where amid images of lush
tropical scenery, celebrity John Davidson questions folks
"from all walks of life who decided to reach for their
financial freedom."
   After Mr. Davidson introduces them, the guests relate the
rewards of applying the principles of Mr. Del Dotto --
"self-made millionaire and best-selling author" of "How to
Make Nothing but Money." The story of Adam Stone, a former
exercise physiologist, seems to the audience especially
startling. At just 26 years old, he says he controls $1
million in property, has $600,000 in equity and grosses
$6,000 to $7,000 a month in rental income.
   Later, viewers are advised to pay $367 for Mr. Del Dotto's
writings on creative financing, credit, foreclosures, tax
sales, government loans and auctions and running a business.
"Please don't try to compare this system to anything else on
the market," cautions an announcer, "because there's nothing
like it."
