   ST. LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp., buffeted by lower
earnings in nearly all of its businesses, said operating
results for the first quarter fell 17.5%, but a $61.5 million
windfall boosted net income by 64%.
   The gain, which came from the settlement of an antitrust
lawsuit with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., lifted net
income to $123.7 million, or $2.97 a share. A year earlier,
the company earned $75.4 million, or $1.81 a share. Revenue
rose 5% to $2.49 billion from $2.36 billion.

   Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp.'s first
quarter net income soared to $96 million, or $2.04 a share,
from $9.7 million, or 21 cents a share. Earnings for the
latest period included $67.1 million from the sale of
Northrop's corporate headquarters complex.
   Northrop's operating earnings also increased sharply,
rising threefold as the company recovered from a year-ago
writedown in its electronics segment. Sales were flat at
$1.28 billion.
   In some ways, though, the tales of these two arms makers
showed how misleading quarterly figures can be in trying to
predict the future. Northrop, for example, turned in a
relatively impressive operating performance in part because
of stepped up production on the B-2 Stealth bomber. But that
programs seems, over the long term, to be in a particularly
precarious position with Washington budget-cutters.
   By contrast, General Dynamics is incurring squeezed profit
margins at its F-16 fighter factory because it is "staggering
under the work load" of trying to churn out several versions
of the plane simultaneously, James Cunnane, chief financial
officer, said in an interview here. He added that "there is
constant pressure" also being applied to meet schedules on
two other aircraft programs, the A-12 for the Navy and the
Advanced Tactical Fighter for the Air Force.
   At the same time, Mr. Cunnane pointed out, General
Dynamics is spending development dollars on the Atlas rocket,
but it won't begin to record income on the program until the
first launch, which is set for the third quarter.
   "We're suffering from the inefficiencies of expansion," he
said. "I expect that we're going to be in this mode for a
while."
   Northrop's real estate sale also helped it reduce debt to
$881 million from $1.12 billion at the end of 1989. The
balance of its after-tax gain, $22.8 million, will be
deferred and amortized into income over the 10-year lease of
the space in the building Northrop now occupies.
   Operating margins in this year's first quarter included
the recognition of $10.7 million in pension income, as
compared with $3.2 million in pension costs a year before.
   Profits in the aircraft group at Northrop slumped to $56.8
million from $79.3 million, which was in step with a decline
in F/A-18 fighter sales to prime contractor McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and 747 component sales to Boeing Co. Earnings on the
electronics side improved, however, to $8.4 million from a
$13.7 million loss last year when the company made a $26
million provision in connection with research expenses on a
system for the F-15 fighter.
   The biggest winner at General Dynamics was its Cessna
unit, which manufactures small planes. Earnings there leaped
to $16.5 million from $4.3 million.
   But, in the current environment, it would be incorrect to
describe any defense contractor as being in enviable shape.
"General Dynamics is just a microcosm of the defense budget,"
said George Shapiro, aerospace analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "They're going to feel a steady deterioration in their
profit margins."
   He noted that in the first quarter, the company
experienced such problems on the Trident submarine. On top of
that, margins were tighter on the Standard, Phalanx and
Tomahawk missiles, where General Dynamics's role slipped to
that of a second-source supplier. The company once enjoyed
the lead on all of those projects.
