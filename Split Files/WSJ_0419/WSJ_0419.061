   NEW YORK -- The dollar tumbled against most major
currencies yesterday despite a report of a sharp improvement
in the U.S. merchandise trade performance in February.
   Dealers said the U.S. unit had expended its energy in the
days leading up to the release of the trade data, advancing
on expectations that the trade deficit would narrow
substantially. But when the expected improvement was finally
reported, the market tried to lift the dollar and was met
almost instantly by selling.

   It was obvious that the market was long on dollars before
the trade figures were released, said Douglas Madison,
corporate trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles. A brief
effort to take the dollar higher right after release of the
figures was countered by a large number of orders to sell, he
said. "It was just a wall that the interbank market in no way
could break through," he added.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's
merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $6.49 billion in
February from a revised gap of $9.32 billion in January. The
result was the best recorded since December 1983. Economists
had forecast a February deficit of $7.6 billion, although
some currency dealers had been talking about deficits as
narrow as $4.5 billion to $5 billion in recent days.
   One minute after the release of the data, the dollar hit
its intraday high of 1.6830 marks and 1.4940 Swiss francs.
But the U.S. currency put up little defense of such heights.
A few minutes later, the dollar had turned sharply lower
against the West German and Swiss currencies as well as
against the yen.
   Hubert Pedroli, vice president and manager of foreign
exchange at Credit Suisse in New York, said a trader at his
firm was selling the dollar to one customer for 1.6830 marks
almost as he was buying it from another for 1.6770 marks. The
whole thing lasted 10 seconds, he said.
   Against the yen, dealers didn't even try to push the U.S.
currency higher, he said. The dollar never went up against
its Japanese counterpart because 160.00 yen had previously
proved a solid ceiling, he said. People bought the dollar
ahead of the trade number, he said. Once the news was out,
"it just couldn't go higher."
   The dollar was trading at 159.60 yen just before the
release of the trade data.
   Charles Spence, vice president of foreign exchange at
First Interstate of California in Los Angeles, said dealers
quickly noted that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan had
widened for the month despite the overall narrowing. As a
result, the first analysis led to a sell-off of the dollar
against the yen, he said.
   U.S. imports from Japan exceeded exports to that country
by $3.12 billion for the month, swelling from $2.86 billion
in January.
   Bank of America's Mr. Madison said the worsening U.S.
trade performance with Japan will strengthen the position of
those who argue that the U.S. should take part in some effort
-- like intervention -- to bring the dollar lower against the
yen.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6722 marks, down from 1.6768 marks late Tuesday, and at
158.10 yen, down from 159.68 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6392, up from $1.6385 Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at
158.35 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 159.87 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6735 marks.
   The Treasury Department said in a report to Congress
yesterday that the depreciation of the yen is a matter of
concern and that the Group of Seven industrialized nations
will keep developments under review. However, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress earlier that the
recent decline of the yen is of no immediate concern and that
the Japanese unit has been relatively stable over the past
two to three years.
   The Brady statement came late in the trading day and had
no impact on rates. The report was released following the
close of trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $376.10 an ounce, up 90 cents. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $376.70 an
ounce.
