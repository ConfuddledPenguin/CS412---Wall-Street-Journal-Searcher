   NEW YORK -- Dayton Hudson Corp. has emerged as the clear
front-runner to acquire the Marshall Field's department store
chain, according to people familiar with the situation.
   Marshall Field's, one of the country's most famous
retailers, was put up for sale last year by B.A.T Industries
PLC as part of a restructuring to fight a takeover bid by Sir
James Goldsmith. B.A.T, which also is selling its Saks Fifth
Avenue unit, had set last Monday as the deadline for bids for
the 24-store Field's chain.

   People familiar with B.A.T, a British company that also is
involved in tobacco and financial services, said an agreement
with Dayton Hudson could be reached this week. A deal would
link two of the Midwest's largest retailers and give Dayton
Hudson dominant positions in Chicago and several other
Midwestern cities.
   Executives of Dayton Hudson and their investment bankers
from Salomon Brothers Inc. met yesterday with B.A.T
representatives to negotiate a contract, people familiar with
the talks said. The negotiations were held at the offices
here of Chadbourne &amp; Parke, the law firm representing B.A.T.
   Jerome C. Katz, a partner with Chadbourne &amp; Parke,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Minneapolis-based Dayton
Hudson also declined to comment.
   Details of the Dayton Hudson bid couldn't be learned. Some
have estimated that Marshall Field's might bring between $850
million and $950 million. Other interested parties were said
to include May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, and
Dillard Department Stores Inc., based in Little Rock, Ark.
   Philip Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of
Marshall Field's, said in an interview yesterday that a
management group also submitted a bid for Field's. "We
haven't had a response yet," said Mr. Miller, who declined to
comment on any other aspects of the sale.
   Marshall Field's operates l5 stores in Chicago, four in
Wisconsin, four in Texas, and one in Ohio. For the year ended
Jan. 31, 1989, the chain generated about $1.09 billion in
revenue and earned $91 million before depreciation, interest
and taxes.
   Dayton Hudson, which last year earned $410 million on
$13.64 billion in revenue, operates 37 department stores
under the Hudson and Dayton's names in Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   "It appears to be a terrific fit," said one retail
executive who declined to be identified. "Both are high-end
department stores. They share the same customer base and
dominate their key cities. What this means is that Dayton
Hudson will dominate Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis."
   Dayton Hudson has performed extremely well in recent
years, according to some retail observers. "Basically,
they've improved the operations in all of their divisions,"
said Marcia Raley, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc., based
in Minneapolis. "They've also changed their promotional
stance," continued Ms. Raley. "Customers no longer think
everything is on sale. This helps gross margins because more
of their revenues are coming at full price."
   Richard Pyle, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in
Minneapolis, said the department store division now accounts
for about 12% of Dayton Hudson's total revenue.
   "Those stores dominate their market areas," said Mr. Pyle.
"Both Dayton's in Minneapolis-St. Paul and the Hudson group
in Detroit are both probably in the 40% market-share area.
These are full-line department stores which serve a lot of
loyal customers. Marshall Field's would be an excellent
acquisition because it shares many of the same
characteristics."
   Under Mr. Miller, who took over the chief executive's job
in 1983, Marshall Field's has accomplished a substantial
turnaround. "It's a store which has successfully switched its
approach from serving the carriage trade to serving the
contemporary fashion needs of middle to upper-income
customers," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail
Marketing Report.
