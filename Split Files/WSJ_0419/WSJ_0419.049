   G. Heileman Brewing Co. said it is negotiating with its
banks to restructure its huge debt, the result of its $1.3
billion leveraged buy-out by the Australian investor Alan
Bond in 1987. No agreements with the lenders have been
reached, a company spokesman said.
   According to news reports in Australia, Heileman and its
bankers, led by Bank of Boston Corp., are discussing a
debt-for-equity swap that would give the banks some ownership
in the brewer in return for some debt forgiveness.

   A spokesman for Heileman, based in LaCrosse, Wis.,
declined to comment on details of the discussions.
   The troubled brewer, fifth largest in the nation, is
reported to have about $850 million in bank debt and junk
bonds. Analysts have reported that the company has a $60
million principal payment due to its banks in June and
another $50 million payment at year end.
   Heileman declined to comment on its debt or the payment
schedule. A spokesman for the Bank of Boston also declined to
comment.
   In January, Heileman said it had an operating profit for
the first half of its fiscal year, which ends June 30, but a
net loss following interest payments. Heileman declined to
comment on its third-quarter performance; but analysts and
consultants have reported that the company's market share
declined almost 10% in 1989, putting the company below the
"critical mass" needed to play in today's highly competitive
beer market.
   "They've got less than a year," said Tom Pirko, president
of consulting company BevMark Inc. of Los Angeles. "There's
no practical way they can continue on. They're a good company
in many ways and have some brands with good equity but
they're heading for a fall."
   Heileman is known to have some assets up for sale,
including some breweries, but liquidation of all the
company's assets still may not raise sufficient money to pay
off the debt. Mr. Bond paid between two and three times what
the company is now worth, analysts and individuals in the
industry estimate. These people put the value of Heileman
assets at between $350 million and $500 million.
   Some industry experts have compared Heileman's bank debt
to the debt of Third World countries, because it appears that
the loans can't be paid off in full out of income. The
difference, says Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's
Insights, is that the "banks can't sell a Third World
country. They can sell Heileman."
   Earlier this month, Mr. Bond's Australian company, Bond
Corp. Holdings Ltd., posted a loss of A$758.2 million (US$580
million) for the first half of the fiscal year, which ends
June 30, mainly due to losses incurred on asset sales and
write-downs on the value of certain assets. The latest
results compare with a year-earlier profit of A$152.8
million.
   In the latest results, Bond Corp. disclosed that as of
Dec. 31, Heileman was carried on Bond Corp.'s books at a
value of A$532.5 million. Bond Corp. paid $1.28 billion for
Heileman in 1987 and later sold a small part of the U.S.
concern.
   Bond Corp., 58%-owned by Mr. Bond, has announced an
agreement to sell its Australian breweries to a 58%-owned
unit, Bell Resources Ltd., for A$1.85 billion. Those
breweries as a whole represent the second-largest beer maker
in Australia.
