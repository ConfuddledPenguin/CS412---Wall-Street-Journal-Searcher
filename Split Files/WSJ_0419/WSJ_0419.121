   WASHINGTON -- Charles Keating used loans by Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association to entice a business partner to
lend to Lincoln's cash-strapped holding company only weeks
before federal regulators seized the thrift last year,
lawyers for the government charged.
   Lincoln agreed in February 1989 to put up $13 million in
two business deals with Saudi European Bank, a frequent
business partner of Mr. Keating's. At the same time, the
government lawyers asserted in federal court here, the Saudi
bank agreed to loan $3.75 million to American Continental
Corp., Lincoln's parent. American Continental needed the
money because it was facing bond payments of about $5 million
in early April, the lawyers said. Mr. Keating is American
Continental's chairman.

   Lincoln was taken over on April 14 of last year, and the
government has said it may cost more than $2 billion to bail
out the Irvine, Calif., thrift. Regulators said the thrift
was engaging in many such transactions that benefited
American Continental at the expense of Lincoln, which held
more than $4 billion in government-insured deposits.
   James Murphy, a lawyer for the government, described the
transactions with the Saudi bank as he cross-examined Mr.
Keating for a second day in Mr. Keating's suit to reverse the
takeover.
   Mr. Keating angrily denied that the three transactions
with the Saudi bank were related. "Mr. Murphy, that is not
correct," he said. "That is absurd."
   But Stanley Sporkin, the federal district judge presiding
over the trial, asked Mr. Keating whether having American
Continental and Lincoln do business with the same customers
didn't raise conflict-of-interest problems. "Sometimes you
wore a Lincoln hat. Sometimes you wore an (American
Continental) hat," Judge Sporkin said. "So didn't you open
yourself to these kinds of suggestions?"
   "Yes," Mr. Keating replied. But he maintained that he
didn't even know of Lincoln's transactions with the Saudi
bank.
   Mr. Murphy described an intricate series of transactions
in which he said Lincoln sold part of a profit participation
in a business run by British financier Sir James Goldsmith,
only to buy it back six months later. The transaction allowed
American Continental to book a $37 million gain for 1987.
Without the gain, American Continental would have had a loss
of $11 million for that year, the government said.
   Mr. Murphy introduced a Lincoln memo suggesting that the
buyer of the profit participation -- a subsidiary of Saudi
European Bank -- wanted only a "fee" and interest when the
participation was sold back to Lincoln. Mr. Murphy said that
this indicated the participation had been sold to the Saudi
bank subsidiary simply as a ruse to enable American
Continental to record the gain.
   In addition, Mr. Murphy said, the participation had been
sold for $59 million, when Mr. Keating had estimated its
value at about $75 million. Lincoln bought the participation
back from the subsidiary for $68.5 million.
   Mr. Keating said Mr. Goldsmith's business plans for the
unit, General Oriental Securities Limited Partnership,
changed and the Saudi bank subsidiary decided it no longer
wanted the profit participation. "They had no expectation I
would take them out of that transaction" when Lincoln
originally sold the participation, Mr. Keating said.
