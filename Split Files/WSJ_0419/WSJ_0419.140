   Peugeot S.A., a French auto maker, said consolidated
profit grew 16% to 10.3 billion francs ($1.83 billion) in
1989 from 8.85 billion francs a year earlier.
   The result slightly exceeded analysts' previous estimates
of about 10 billion francs.

   The earnings advance came despite a strike at two assembly
plants of Automobiles Peugeot S.A. during September and
October that pared about 60,000 autos from 1989 production
and reduced consolidated revenue by about three billion
francs, according to company estimates.
   Revenue rose 10% to 152.96 billion francs last year from
138.45 billion francs in 1988.
   The company said its directors proposed a net annual
dividend of 16 francs a share. The proposed payout compares
with the 1988 dividend of 28 francs, which was made prior to
July's 2-for-1 stock split.
