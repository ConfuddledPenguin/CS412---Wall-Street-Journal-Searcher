   PASADENA, Calif. -- Conversion Industries Inc., an
independent power-production company, said it agreed to build
a $50 million oil-recovery facility and cogeneration power
plant in Kern County, Calif., in a joint venture with Energy
Reserve Inc. of Phoenix, Ariz.
   At full production, the oil-recovery facility is expected
to produce about 2,500 barrels of oil a day, Conversion said.
Project construction is expected to begin next month. All
electric power will be sold to San Francisco-based Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co.
