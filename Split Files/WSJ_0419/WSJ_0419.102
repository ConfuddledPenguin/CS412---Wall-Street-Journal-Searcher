   A federal judge ruled that Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. is not
liable for damages arising from alleged insider trading
related to Maxus Energy Corp.'s acquisition of Natomas Co. in
1983.
   Kidder Peabody, a unit of General Electric Co., had filed
suit in New York in 1987, seeking a declaratory judgment that
the firm has no liability to Maxus.

   Kidder's action came the same day that Maxus filed suit in
state court in Dallas, charging that alleged insider trading
between investment banker Martin A. Siegel, then with Kidder
Peabody, and Ivan F. Boesky forced its predecessor company,
Diamond Shamrock Corp., to pay too much for Natomas. Maxus
sought $1.6 billion in damages.
   Maxus alleged that Mr. Boesky, acting on inside
information about the transaction from Kidder's Mr. Siegel,
bought Natomas stock while Diamond Shamrock was planning its
purchase. Prior to the purchase, Natomas's stock price shot
up, leading Diamond to make an initial tender offer $300
million higher than necessary, the company had alleged.
   In a ruling last week, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack
of New York said that Maxus had not suffered injury during
the Natomas transactions and was not entitled to make claims
against Kidder based on the alleged stock price run-up. Judge
Pollack wrote that Maxus had previously said it did not
intend to litigate such claims against Kidder but that he was
still issuing a ruling because Maxus's amended complaint
contradicted such assertions.
   Judge Pollack's ruling does not affect Maxus's efforts in
the suit to recover more than $4 million in fees and expenses
it paid to Kidder for the transaction. That portion of the
suit is still pending in Texas.
   "From the outset we regarded Maxus's legal and factual
position to be seriously flawed. We believe Judge Pollack's
decision completely vindicates our position," said Gary P.
Naftalis of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, a lawyer
for Kidder Peabody.
   A spokeswoman for Maxus said the company would not appeal
because it does not believe the ruling will negatively affect
its case in Texas.

   THE FDIC is slapped with a default judgment for not
responding to a suit.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Scott in Miami entered the
judgment against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. this
week for failing to provide a timely answer to a suit filed
by a company created by shareholders of Overseas Corp., a
Miami development company.
   If the default judgment stands, the government entity will
be held liable to Overseas Investment Recovery Corp.,
attorneys in the case said. The sole question remaining will
be how much, if any, in damages are due to the plaintiff.
"The FDIC has to play by the same rules as everyone else,"
said James F. Gilbride, a Miami attorney for Overseas.
   But FDIC says the rules are in fact different for it. It
claims that as a federal agency it has 60 days to answer a
complaint, not the 20 days afforded other litigants. "It's
not a matter of overlooking anything," said Jack Courtney, an
attorney with the FDIC in Dallas. "It's our contention we
have 60 days to answer suits because we're the U.S.
government."
   "I'll be happy to litigate that issue," responds Mr.
Gilbride, saying that the FDIC is a corporation, not a
government agency allotted the 60-day response time. Mr.
Gilbride contends that because of the manner in which the
FDIC is operated and managed, it isn't an agency. Among other
things, he says, since the executive branch does not exercise
any direct supervisory control over the FDIC, it doesn't fit
the definition of an agency. "It's something that will have
to be drawn out at a hearing," he says.
   Overseas Corp. has been in a heated dispute with the FDIC
over an Orlando, Fla., hotel-resort project that the federal
government foreclosed on after seizing fraud-riddled Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan Association in Dallas in 1986.
   Overseas Investment Recovery Corp., a company formed to
pursue litigation for Overseas Corp., claims the FDIC
breached its obligations to the borrower and reneged on
agreements to settle litigation on several occasions. The
developer claims it suffered $50 million in actual damages
and also wants $750 million in punitive damages from the
FDIC.
   FDIC officials in Dallas huddled in a meeting Wednesday
afternoon to review the judge's default. "Obviously this has
been a topic of discussion here today," Mr. Courtney said,
adding that the agency will attempt to convince the judge
that the FDIC is entitled to 60 days.
   The FDIC inherited the bitter squabble with Overseas when
the agency assumed the role of deposit insuror for the
defunct Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. last year
following the thrift bailout legislation.

   BREW-PUB BAN in Michigan doesn't violate federal antitrust
laws, court rules.
   The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling may make it
more difficult for would-be owners of such
brewery-restaurant-bar combinations in other states to fight
restrictions, attorneys say. Although the ruling doesn't set
a precedent in other circuits, other federal and state courts
probably will use it for guidance in absence of their own
precedent-setting cases, says Brian McCollam, attorney with
Cowen Crowley &amp; Nord in Chicago, who works with Illinois
brew-pub owners. "If I was a lawyer in Texas, I'd tell my
client the battle has become a little more difficult," he
said.
   Although 30 states have accepted brewery-restaurant-bar
combinations, the battle continues in some states, including
Texas and Georgia, over whether to allow a small brewery to
sell its own beer. Some state laws prohibit one entity from
owning more than one type of liquor or beer license,
restricting them to brewing, distributing or retailing. And
legislative efforts in several states to change the so-called
"three-tier" laws have been vociferously opposed by state
wholesale and distributor associations afraid of losing their
role as middlemen in the beer and liquor business.
   Thomas Burns Jr., attorney for the plaintiff, Traffic Jam
and Snug Inc., in the Michigan case, argued that the Michigan
law violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. By dictating the
three-tier system and exclusive distributor territories, he
contended, the liquor statutes inhibit competition. He
further argued that the state liquor commission was engaging
in anticompetitive behavior by prohibiting Traffic Jam from
holding both a brewer's and retailer's license.
   But the appellate judges, in their ruling earlier this
month, agreed with a lower court's ruling that the
commission's action was "pure state action" and therefore
immune from federal antitrust regulation. Mr. Burns says his
client intends to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
case.
   The Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers Association, which
blocked legislative action that would have allowed brew-pubs,
applauded the decision.
   The association called the case "one of the most vicious
and far-reaching attacks on the legislatively mandated
three-tier distribution system."

   TENTATIVE $67.5 MILLION settlement reached in suits over
school bus crash.
   The agreement calls for Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. to
make payments totaling $4.5 million to each of the families
of 15 students who died in the accident near Alton, Texas. In
all, 21 students died and several dozen were injured last
September when a truck owned by Valley Coca-Cola ran into the
bus, knocking it into a water-filled pit. Numerous other
lawsuits still are pending against the company, located in
McAllen, Texas.
   Attorneys involved in the discussions declined to comment
publicly on the tentative settlement, noting that some
details still are being ironed out, and that any agreement
would be subject to court approval.
   The proposed settlement comes as controversy increases
over ambulance-chasing charges growing out of the bus
tragedy. At least three civil damage cases have been filed
alleging unethical conduct by Texas lawyers in the aftermath
of the bus crash. In two of the cases, attorneys are suing
each other, leveling charges of improper solicitation,
client-stealing and slander.
   Several Texas attorneys also have been indicted by a state
grand jury in Edinburg, Texas. They are charged with
illegally promoting and soliciting lawsuits after the bus
crash.
