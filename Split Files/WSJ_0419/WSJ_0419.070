   Continental Bank Corp.'s first-quarter profit dropped 25%,
as problem loans increased and the cost of hiring some
high-priced traders and investment bankers cut into the
Chicago bank's bottom line.
   And First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles, reported a 4%
decline in net income, reflecting the continuing drag of
$2.05 billion of nonperforming assets, stubbornly high
expenses, a drop in loans outstanding and a foreign-exchange
trading loss of $7.8 million compared with a year-ago trading
gain of $22.7 million.

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Continental's shares fell $1.125 to $14.625 while First
Interstate's rose 87.5 cents to $36.
   At Continental, net income for the quarter fell to $56.7
million, or 89 cents a share, from $75.6 million, or $1.23 a
share, a year earlier. The year-ago figures are restated to
reflect discontinued operations.
   The first-quarter comparison would have been worse but for
gains of $34 million before tax on the sale of real estate,
compared with $17 million of such gains a year ago.
   The problem for Continental, as for many big banks, is
that the number of acquisitions and other big deals that need
financing has dropped off sharply. At the same time,
Continental is paying some big salaries to bankers hired in
recent quarters to boost its lending, trading and other
business with corporate clients. Salaries and other benefits
grew $10 million in the quarter from a year earlier, while
the number of employees was essentially unchanged.
   Continental's First Options of Chicago Inc. unit, which is
up for sale, posted a $5 million loss for the quarter -- the
combination of operating losses and of the parent further
marking down the unit's value. Continental said it expects to
announce a sale agreement for First Options, which guarantees
and processes futures and options trades, before June 30. It
wouldn't elaborate.
   Nonperforming loans -- those 60 days or more past due at
Continental -- rose about 6% to $455 million at March 31 from
$430 million at year's end. About half of both those figures
represent loans to less-developed countries. The total
reserve for loan losses was $258 million at March 31.
   Continental said one big loan on a so-called highly
leveraged transaction -- meaning a leveraged buy-out or
recapitalization -- accounted for a $45 million increase in
nonperforming loans to such borrowers. It wouldn't identify
the borrower.
   First Interstate's net fell to $127.2 million, or $2.23 a
share, from $132.2 million, or $2.81 a share, a year earlier.
   First Interstate's earnings were boosted by a very low
6.5% tax rate, $6.8 million of tax credits and a $30 million
gain from an accounting change. Year-ago results were taxed
at 28.5% but were aided by a $21.8 million tax credit and a
$16.1 million gain from the accounting change. Stripped of
these special items, First Interstate's pretax earnings fell
21% to $103.9 million, from $131.8 million.
   The company established huge reserves late last year for
expected losses from rapid disposition of nonperforming
assets in Texas, and for troubled Arizona real estate. It
used some of those reserves in the first quarter, recording
$198.1 million of loan charge-offs that helped reduce Texas
nonperforming assets by $208 million in the quarter. The
losses were only partly offset by a $91.8 million loan-loss
provision. As a result, First Interstate's total reserve
against losses fell by $139 million, but at $1.3 billion, it
is still 114% of nonperforming loans, a relatively high
level.
   "The aggressive actions that were taken at the end of
1989, especially the accelerated asset disposition program in
Texas, are beginning to pay off," said Joseph J. Pinola,
First Interstate's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our
Texas bank is reporting earnings, while our Arizona bank is
now slightly above break-even and meeting our expectations."
   Donald Crowley, a bank analyst for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods
Inc., said the first-quarter earnings were slightly better
than expected, and "a crucial first step toward rebuilding
creditability in the marketplace."
   Nonetheless, First Interstate's annualized return on
assets, the key measure of bank profitability, was a mediocre
0.68% in the first quarter, excluding special gains but
including the low tax rate. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., a big
California competitor that may bid for First Interstate after
Mr. Pinola steps down in June, has a return of about twice
that rate, even though it is fully taxed. Moreover, First
Interstate's stock remains mired in the mid-$30s, down 50%
from last fall, increasing its vulnerability to an
unsolicited takeover.
