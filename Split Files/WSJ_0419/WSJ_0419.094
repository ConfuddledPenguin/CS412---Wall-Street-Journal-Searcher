   With Easter past and Passover ended, we are left with only
one remaining spring religious celebration. This Sunday the
bishops and cardinals of environmentalism will gather their
flocks for Earth Day.
   We do not say this to mock, for in our book the religious
impulse is commendable. Men and women ennoble themselves by
reaching out for contact with the transcendental, the
universe beyond themselves. We accept the thought that the
current wave of concern with the environment started when
astronauts brought back the first photographs of the Earth
from space, showing a shining jewel against the black
vastness of the cosmos. Surely, the image said, we have been
endowed with something extraordinary, something precious and
something vulnerable.

   We are coming to see environmentalism as a religion,
rather, in a quest for understanding. Those of us attuned
primarily to concerns of the secular world have trouble
fitting the movement into our usual categories. As much as
anyone else, we are in favor of clean air, blue water,
wholesome food, verdant parks, neat streets, pristine
mountains and unspoiled deserts. Having set these ends, we
turn to our usual means: cost-benefit analysis, emissions
taxes, economic growth, technology-clean nuclear power, for
example. Yet consensus with environmentalists seems to take
no roots; indeed, our very efforts seem to make it more and
more remote.
   So perhaps we could comprehend more by taking
environmentalism as not at all about this world, but about
the next world. Not ultimately about mere material things,
but about the cleansing of sins and the saving of souls. The
religious jargon is a bit disconcerting at first, but it does
seem to explain many puzzles.
   The catechism of global warming, for example, is clearly
sustained by a leap of faith. Such empirical data as exist
are inconclusive, in the case of satellite measurements over
the past decade, negative. Scientists agree that other things
being equal increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases will raise the Earth's temperature, but disagree on how
much, whether the other things are equal and indeed what they
may even be. But even without data, the hypothesis is taken
as confirmed by "computer models," the contemporary world's
font of pure revelation.
   The faith remains undisturbed, too, by the confounding of
predictions. The world has somehow not yet run out of crude
oil, the Club of Rome notwithstanding. Asbestos confined in
walls is no threat, even the conventional wisdom has come to
agree. Acid rain, extensive scientific analysis has now
concluded, causes isolated problems; the easy answer is to
dump limestone in acid lakes. Yet the altars of these causes
still bend under the weight of huge sacrifices.
   Mysterious hearth rites have arisen; costumed priests
exorcise homes of radon and other evil spirits. Commandments
are particularly directed at the arrogance of mankind: Thou
shall not split the atom, nor touch the forbidden fruit of
the gene. Certain animals are deemed sacred, though
nasty-tempered mink seem a curious choice over the Hindu's
gentle cows. Certain foods are non-kosher, particularly palm
and coconut oils. The new rabbinate proscribes the mixing of
glass and aluminum with other garbage. The holiest renounce
the carnal altogether for the monkish life of Vermont.
   It matters little whether the professed worldly goals are
in fact accomplished. If limits on U.S. tuna fishing mean
more dolphins die as tuna is taken by less careful foreign
fleets, the American soul is still cleansed. If the end of
DDT deprives impoverished Third World children of cheap
protection against malaria, the return of the peregrine
falcon still uplifts the human spirit. Loggers put out of
jobs find their reward in the immortality of the spotted owl.
   All of this is tied together with a chiliastic thread. As
the second millennium approaches, the apocalypse must be upon
us. The devout search frantically to learn which of the seven
ends will ensue: The fire of nuclear war. The ice of nuclear
winter. The unseen peril of radiation, or a new plague as a
judgment for genetic tampering. The roast of global warming,
or the judgment of a new ice age, the climatological fear of
only a decade ago. Or merely perhaps terminal boredom in the
end of history?
   These insights into the environmental creed, admittedly,
yield no easy prescription. The methods of secular society
are designed to deal with material impulses, and are often
confounded by spiritual ones. Even if it were possible,
containing such impulses probably would not be wise.
Religions do mobilize people for true progress, and
environmentalism can claim no little credit for cleaner air
and water. Newly born religions often display disagreeable
traits such as excessive evangelism, intolerance of the
heathen and the suppression of any deviation as heresy. But
usually, as they mature, they develop the even more sacred
traits of inner peace, forgiveness and humility.
