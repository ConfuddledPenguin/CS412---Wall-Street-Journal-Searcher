   NEW YORK -- Thomson McKinnon Inc. agreed in principle to
sell its general partnership interest in its asset management
company to a group including executives of the money manager.
   The money manager, Thomson McKinnon Asset Management
Limited Partnership, is Thomson McKinnon's largest remaining
operating company. Thomson McKinnon, which is liquidating,
last year sold its retail brokerage network to
Prudential-Bache Securities Group Inc. The operations that
remained of the broker-dealer unit filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
last month.

   Greylock Investments and TA Associates, both of Boston,
and several investment advisers of Thomson McKinnon Asset
Management are proposing to acquire Thomson McKinnon's
general partnership interest in the manager of mutual funds
and private accounts.
   Greylock and TA are closely held equity investment firms
with a total of more than $1 billion of committed equity
capital. The Thomson unit had $6.7 billion in assets under
management as of March 31. The group doesn't plan to buy any
of the public limited partnership units.
   Under the plan, the group would become the general
partner, purchasing 200,000 general partnership units from
Thomson McKinnon for $800,000 and paying $5.4 million for an
option to acquire the balance of Thomson's total of about 6.2
million units. The option would have to be exercised by 1994,
and dividends would go toward reducing the purchase price.
   The agreement also includes the sale of the broker
dealer's Thomson McKinnon Fund Distributors Inc.
