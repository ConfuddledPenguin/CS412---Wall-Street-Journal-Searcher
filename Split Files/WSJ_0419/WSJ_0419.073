   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. said it will increase capital
spending about 28% to US$500 million this year, despite a
sharp drop in first-quarter earnings that resulted largely
from deteriorating nickel prices.
   Donald Phillips, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, told the annual meeting, "Substantial capital
investments and further improvements in productivity will be
required to remain a low-cost nickel producer."

   Unit production costs at Inco, the Western world's largest
nickel producer, increased about 24% in 1989. Mr. Phillips
said costs are likely to increase between 5% and 10% this
year. He said the increase is mostly a result of lower ore
grades and continued strength of the Canadian dollar against
other currencies.
   Inco posted a 76% decline in first-quarter earnings to
$67.7 million, or 64 cents a share, from $276.3 million, or
$2.60 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales fell 34% to $734.5 million from $1.12 billion.
   The company said its realized price for nickel in the
quarter was $3.69 a pound, down from $6.59 a year earlier.
Mr. Phillips said the company's realized price now runs about
10 to 20 cents above the trading price of nickel on the
London Metal Exchange, where it is currently quoted at about
$3.85 a pound.
   Industry analysts are divided on the near-term direction
of the metal, but most see a slip below $3 a pound as a
distinct possibility before year end.
   "I think the rally in January and February has fizzled,"
said Julian Baldry, senior mining analyst with Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc. He said the price of nickel depends to a
large degree on auto sales, housing starts and durable goods
orders, all of which have bearish outlooks. He said he
expects the metal to decline below $3 a pound this year.
   "I see a fabulous time for the company in the longer term,
but I think we have a valley to travel through first," Mr.
Baldry said.
   Analysts also are concerned about Inco's debt level and
reduced cash flow, which is earnings plus depreciation
allowances. The company has about $1 billion in debt, largely
a result of a $1 billion special dividend paid in early 1989.
   In a recent report, John Lydall, an analyst with First
Marathon Securities Ltd., said Inco's debt level isn't
unusual for a company of its size, "but when combined with a
shortage of liquid assets, reduced cash flows and a high
capital expenditure program, it's not a comfortable
situation."
   Mr. Phillips, the chief executive, disagrees. "I think
we're in a very, very strong financial position," he said.
   Alan Ferry, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., agreed that the company is in good shape. He said he
doesn't see any financial problems for Inco, as long as
nickel stays in the range of $3 to $4 a pound.
   About $155 million of the company's capital spending
budget will go to a $400 million sulfur dioxide
emission-reduction program, Inco said. It said a "significant
portion" will go to the development of existing and new
nickel mines in Ontario and Manitoba, as well as to the
expansion of nickel production capacity in Indonesia.
   Mr. Phillips said that while 1990 probably won't be
another record earnings year for the company, it "could still
be a very good year." But he said, "How we will fare during
the balance of this year cannot be predicted with any great
certainty."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Inco shares
closed at $24.875, unchanged.
