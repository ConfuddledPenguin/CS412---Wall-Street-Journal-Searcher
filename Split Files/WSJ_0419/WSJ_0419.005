   HAVANA, Cuba -- Last month, the Cuban government practiced
a one-day trial of what it calls a "special period in
peacetime" -- a dry run of how the country plans to survive
in a siege economy.
   Workers at one of the country's largest steel plants
burned wood for fuel in the mill. The University of Havana
dimmed classroom lights. Fidel Castro proclaimed that no
matter how bad things got the all-important sugar crop would
be harvested "even if we have to use oxen."

   Things are tough here and getting tougher. The Socialist
bloc has crumbled, leaving Cuba's government isolated
ideologically and its economy vulnerable. "This is our most
critical moment in 25 years," whispers a young economist.
   A four-day visit here produced impressions of an embattled
society. Although Cuba's future seems uncertain, Mr. Castro
remains firmly in control.
   As the world around him changes, Mr. Castro, dressed in
the green military uniforms he has worn for the past 31
years, remains the same.
   Flanked by high-ranking aides wearing guayaberas, Mr.
Castro answered reporters' questions for more than two hours.
Graying but combative, he told a crowded news conference that
Cuba is one of the most democratic nations in the world. In
fact, he said, stabbing the air with a finger for emphasis,
Cuba is "very short from being a Greek democracy."
   That night, addressing a youth rally, Mr. Castro,
introduced to the crowd as Cuba's "clean-up hitter,"
reiterated his promise of "death before slavery." Mr. Castro
almost seems to call for a U.S. invasion, a Caribbean
Gotterdamerung, that would allow him a glorious if bloody
exit from the dead end at which the revolution seems to have
arrived.
   At the modernistic Soviet Embassy, a tall building that
resembles an airport control tower, a vase of red silk roses
adorns a heroic bust of Lenin.
   The Soviet Union is standing fast by its Caribbean ally.
"We are not going to stop helping our Cuban friends," insists
Yuri Petrov, the Soviet ambassador.
   But the relationship is, nonetheless, changing. According
to the U.S., the Soviets, through favorable terms of trade,
subsidize Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Now
Ambassador Petrov says that the Soviets are discussing with
their Cuban counterparts how to base trade between the two
countries for the next five years on hard currency
transactions. "How long the transition period, we can't say,"
says Mr. Petrov. "There will be change."
   Mr. Petrov says one joint Cuban-Soviet enterprise is over.
The Soviet Union used to send Cuba wood in exchange for the
labor of about 1,000 Cuban lumbermen who worked in the
Siberian forest. "That company didn't work very well," says
Mr. Petrov, sipping coffee. "The Cubans didn't get used to
the weather -- 40 degrees below zero with strong winds."
   In the most recent Soviet election, Mr. Petrov says that
80% of the Soviet personnel in Cuba voted for radical Boris
Yeltsin. He says the Soviets "tell our Cuban comrades of our
experiences" with economic reform and glasnost, "but we never
try to impose our concepts."
   At a meat shop in the colonial part of Havana, a
29-year-old, white-frocked butcher keeps up a manic
affability as he cleaves frozen Brazilian chickens for
customers, who are entitled to purchase, under the country's
rationing system, one chicken every nine days. Bulgaria used
to be Cuba's main supplier of chickens, until turmoil in the
East bloc stopped the traffic in chicken parts. But after Mr.
Castro's trip last month to Brazil, Cuba hasn't lacked for
chickens "not because of Fidel," says the butcher, "but
because the Brazilians are good people."
   Not only are Bulgarian chickens out, says Mr. Castro, Cuba
can no longer swap its sugar, citrus fruits and nickel for
buses from Hungary, or barley from Czechoslovakia. And if
Moscow cuts or reduces its trade, which includes supplying
all of the island's oil, adds the young economist, "we will
have very serious problems."
   Planning for that day, Cuba is striving to increase its
hard currency by promoting tourism, particularly through
joint ventures with Spanish companies. It also is pushing
sales of Cuban biotechnology and pharmaceutical products to
countries like Brazil. Domestically, Cuba is concentrating
its scant resources in increasing agricultural production to
make the island more self-sufficient, and ease consumer
discontent.
   Down the street at a corner grocery store, Elia, the shop
owner, relies on Mr. Castro. As in the rest of Havana, her
store shelves are almost bare of both rationed and freely
available goods. There are jars of unrationed honey, on sale
for two pesos (an average monthly salary in Cuba is about 150
pesos), and garlic sauce, also unrationed. There used to be a
lot more goods available. "Fidel is very intelligent," she
says hopefully. "Let's see if he finds a way out of this."
   Mr. Castro may just soon face some opposition from a
renewed Roman Catholic Church, which is preparing for a visit
from Pope John Paul II. Relations with the church, which had
been improving, have soured lately. During his recent visit
to Brazil, Mr. Castro excoriated the Cuban church hierarchy,
saying it was highly influenced by U.S. policy.
   Preparing for the papal visit, the church has organized
processions to take the image of Cuba's patroness, the Virgin
of Charity, from town to town. The downturn in relations,
says a priest, is partly because of the crowds that have
flocked to the processions, the first independent popular
meetings to be held on the island in three decades. The
government is so unnerved, says the priest, that in some
towns it has organized parallel fiestas and even provided
hard-to-get beer. "But the people took the beer and followed
the virgin," says the priest.
   "We have the government between the sword and the wall,"
says the priest, somewhat optimistically.
   "I wouldn't want my kid to run in and out of traffic
selling cigarettes," says Juan Jacomino, a Foreign Ministry
official. "I've been to Caracas and I know."
   Nowhere in Havana does one find, as in many Latin American
capitals, hordes of child beggars or tin-shack "misery
belts." Instead, neat troops of uniformed schoolchildren
attend day-care centers and schools. Everyone eats, if not
well, and medical care and education are free and available.
   Tomasa Gonzalez, the deputy director of a nursery in old
Havana, inaugurated by Mr. Castro last year, loves her job.
The nursery, which cares for 214 children aged 45 days to 4
1/2 years is spotless and Ms. Gonzalez proudly shows visitors
around the playroom full of colorful children's toys. Dozens
of uniformed tots, segregated by age, doze in separate cots.
   There is a Cuban flag and a bust of Jose Marti, the 19th
century Cuban patriot, in the small, sunny courtyard. Ms.
Gonzalez says she teaches the children love of country,
socialist morals, and respect for national symbols. Sometimes
18-month-old kids, imitating the older children, stand at
attention before the bust of Marti. "This is the nursery of
the New Man, of Communist Man," she says.
   Strolling on the grounds of the University of Havana, a
professor whispers to a visitor. "One must be careful," he
says. "At least four students in each of my classes report to
State Security."
   "I don't use the phone," says one diplomat. "They are all
tapped."
   "Things are bad. People want a change," says the tourist
taxi driver nervously. Then he turns up the volume of the car
radio. "This is a government car. It may be bugged."
