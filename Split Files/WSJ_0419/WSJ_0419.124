   MUTUAL FUNDS with sales-related charges called 12b-1 fees
generally couldn't charge investors more than 7.25% of sales,
under a proposal by the National Association of Securities
Dealers. However, investors who hold their shares for a long
time may be forced to pay more than the 7.25% level.
Yesterday's edition misstated the proposed fee structure.
