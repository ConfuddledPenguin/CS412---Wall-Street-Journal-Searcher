   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, who invited 17 nations to
find "common ground" on global warming issues at a two-day
conference here, closed the meeting by ignoring the
differences among them.
   The conference illustrated the enormous difficulty of
forging a global policy to head off a potential disastrous
warming of the earth caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide
and other so-called greenhouse gases.

   The Dutch, West Germans and some other Europeans said they
were ready to adopt strict limits on carbon-dioxide
production. Apparently nobody else was. The U.S. and the
Japanese said more study is needed, and the Japanese promoted
a 100-year plan to solve warming through new technology. The
Soviets said they need a new tax system. The Indonesians and
the Poles said they are broke.
   "Due to a difficult economic situation, we are not able at
this moment to take up our obligations to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions," said Jan Janowski, Poland's deputy prime
minister, who spent much of his speech praising the U.S. and
trashing totalitarianism.
   President Bush said, "We have never considered research
(on global warming) a substitute for action." Padraig Flynn,
the European Council's minister for the environment, along
with a horde of environmentalists who hovered around the
conference, pointed to that as a commitment by the U.S. to do
something specific about global warming.
   But the White House has said that for some time, while
dodging proposals that would require the U.S. to reduce
greenhouse emissions. The U.S. delegation to the conference
was advised in two pages of "talking points" prepared by the
White House to avoid discussions of whether warming is
accelerating. "A better approach is to raise the many
uncertainties that need to be better understood on this
issue," the paper advised.
   The talking points were distributed to reporters by
environmentalists, to whom they had been leaked.
   After the president's speech, D. Allan Bromley, the
president's science adviser, said the U.S. hadn't changed its
global-warming policy "whatsoever" because of European
criticism. He said the U.S. will be able to "respond" to
specific proposals late this year, when the U.S. plans to
host preliminary talks on a global warming treaty. But "that
doesn't mean we'll have a particular percentage or particular
timetable" regarding greenhouse gas stabilization or
reduction in mind, he quickly added.
   The only concrete proposals President Bush made were to
build international institutes to study global change and
computer networks to link researchers. But even those
seemingly innocuous suggestions sparked controversy when they
were circulated early yesterday. A number of delegates
thought the U.S. was trying to ram the proposals past them
without asking for their assent and that the wording of the
proposals was designed to get them to admit that scientific
knowledge about global warming is more uncertain than they
believe it is. So the U.S. withdrew the proposals, and the
president later characterized them as merely "ideas."
   The sensitivity of the delegates and the apparent distrust
of each other's motives was much in evidence. The U.S.
repeatedly criticized a proposal by the Dutch and others to
sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Americans said
it failed to take into account the economic costs. But J.G.M.
Alders, minister of the environment in the Netherlands, said
his government had thoroughly studied the problem and found
the costs negligible.
   "Do you believe we could go home and take such measures
without anybody saying, `What are the economic effects?'" he
asked.
