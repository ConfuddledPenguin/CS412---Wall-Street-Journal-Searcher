   NEW YORK -- In a move that will hasten a long-delayed $2.5
billion reclamation project for Manhattan's blighted Times
Square, the state took legal title to 34 properties in the
district.
   The acquisition of properties along 42nd Street was set in
motion by the signing of a condemnation order by State
Supreme Court Judge Stanley Parness. The order will allow
developers to clear the site and begin construction of office
towers and the renovation of historic theaters by next year.

   The action came after the project, sponsored by New York
City and New York State, withstood 42 legal challenges from
opponents who claimed it was too large and its tax subsidy
too great. The office tower developer is Times Square Center
Associates, a joint venture of Prudential Realty Group, a
subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America; and Park
Tower Realty.
   Prudential is committing a $241 million letter of credit
to pay for the land purchase and is waiving its right not to
proceed with the project if significant litigation
interfered. The project has overcome obstacles in addition to
litigation.
   Last year, Chemical Bank withdrew from a plan to relocate
its headquarters to the site, and Chicago developer Joseph P.
Kennedy Associates was widely expected to commit to building
a two-million-square-foot merchandise mart. Three years after
beginning negotiations, there is still no deal. Most serious,
many thought the project would collapse under the weight of
New York City's soft economy.
   City and state officials immediately seized on the
condemnation move as proof that the local economy isn't as
damaged as recent reports would indicate.
   "This is a milestone for the economy of New York," said
Gov. Mario Cuomo. Mayor David Dinkins said: "The 42nd Street
Development Project has come to fruition as an economic
stimulus at just the right moment."
   The project still faces hurdles, chief among them the soft
real-estate market. Only five blocks north of the project,
about a half dozen new office towers are still struggling to
find tenants. Also, eight years after the project was agreed
to by the city and state, there aren't any final agreements
with the hotel or mart developer.
   Veronica Hackett, Park Tower executive vice president,
said the company was confident that by the time the new
towers are ready for occupancy in 1992 or 1993, the market
will have turned the corner.
   Most surprised by the move were project opponents who were
caught off guard last week when Prudential determined there
wasn't any significant litigation pending, even though two
cases have yet to be heard on appeal. Equally devastating to
opponents was Prudential's agreement to raise its letter of
credit to $241 million from $155 million to cover land
acquisition and theater-renovation costs.
   "This just proves that an obscene subsidy is being granted
to a single project if in this market they could go ahead and
build four million square feet of speculative office space,"
said Gary Rosenberg, an attorney who sued to stop the project
on behalf of Seymour Durst, a major New York City landholder
and developer. Mr. Rosenberg said he hadn't yet read the
condemnation order and will determine within 30 days whether
to appeal it.
   Carl Weisbrod, president of New York City Public
Development Corp., the city's real-estate arm, said the
latest development cannot be appealed. "This is the most
significant action both because Prudential is committing $2
billion, and because the opponents have exhausted their legal
challenges," he said.
