   Perrier Group of America Inc. agreed to drop the notation
of "naturally sparkling water" from its labels following a
ruling by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The FDA said the carbon dioxide and water are taken out
separately from the Perrier spring.

   "We have a difference in opinion but the FDA feels
consumers will better understand what the product is" with
the revised labeling, said a Perrier spokeswoman.
   The FDA action comes as claims for bottled water come
under increasing scrutiny. Rep. John D. Dingell (D, Mich.)
said recently that he might hold hearings into the marketing
claims of the bottled water industry.
   Perrier Group said its mineral water will be back on store
shelves beginning next week. The company said the revised
label will be on all bottles by July 31.
   In February, Perrier S.A. announced a world-wide recall of
its mineral water after minute levels of benzene, a known
carcinogen, was found in samples of the water. The incident
forced Perrier to disclose that benzene occurs naturally in
Perrier water.
