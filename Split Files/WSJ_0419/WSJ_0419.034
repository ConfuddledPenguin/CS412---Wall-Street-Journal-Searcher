   LOS ANGELES -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., buoyed
by continued strength in its long-distance business and
slimmer costs, said net income rose 12% in the quarter on a
2.7% increase in sales.
   Net income for the first three months was $668 million, or
62 cents a share, from $594 million, or 55 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.89 billion from $8.66
billion in the 1989 quarter.

   While earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations
of 68 cents to 70 cents a share, AT&amp;T posted a strong 21%
increase in operating profit in the quarter, to $1.18 billion
from $977 million the previous year, indicating that its
struggle to control costs is paying off.
   Net income was hurt by several factors including increased
interest expenses, a higher tax rate and costs associated
with last January's network disaster, when a software problem
shut down the company's nationwide long-distance network for
nine hours. In addition, AT&amp;T's telecommunications-equipment
business continues to suffer from increased price competition
and a softening of orders for switching equipment from local
telephone companies.
   Despite these problems, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said
the New York-based company's results showed it was off to "a
strong start toward making 1990 an even stronger year than
1989, which was our best."
   Mr. Allen, who made his comments at the company's annual
meeting at the convention center here, added that AT&amp;T has
set a goal for itself of increasing its earnings by at least
10% to 12% annually. "We were clearly ahead of that in the
first quarter. Typically, the first quarter is a weak one for
us." (Profit in the first quarter actually rose slightly more
than 12%.)
   However, AT&amp;T received a boost from businesses that had
not been a part of the company a year earlier, including
Istel Group Ltd., a U.K. information services company
acquired in the fourth quarter of 1989, and two divisions of
PacifiCorp Financial Services, which were purchased by AT&amp;T
Capital Corp. during the first quarter.
   AT&amp;T's revenue from product sales, including telephone and
computer equipment, increased a meager 1.2% to $2.72 billion
from $2.69 billion the year before. Mr. Allen blamed the
lackluster sales on the "rather weak economy" and a backlog
in computer-systems sales "due to customer demand and our
inability to fill that demand." To improve shipments, AT&amp;T
recently began manufacturing personal computers to augment
supplies from Intel Corp.
   Mr. Allen said the company is banking on new products to
boost sales. These include its recently announced credit
card, in which orders so far "have exceeded our wildest
expectations . . . customers are calling us by the tens of
thousands." In addition, he announced that AT&amp;T will begin
selling switching equipment based on an optical computer
processor developed by Bell Laboratories, within five years.
   Analysts reacted favorably to the company's results. "The
earnings masked what was probably AT&amp;T's best quarter since
divestiture," said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber
Inc. Long-distance "volume is up 7% and operating margins
were 13.2%, two points higher than a year ago. That's a lot
of expansion for a company this size." He estimated that the
network outage alone cost AT&amp;T about three cents a share
because of lost revenue and remittances to business customers
covered under AT&amp;T's 800 Assurance Plan.
   Robert B. Morris III, telecommunications analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said AT&amp;T earnings were about three
cents less than his estimate. And sales, general and
administrative expenses were 35.2% of revenue "when I had
expected 34%." But Mr. Morris said, "I wouldn't characterize
this as a disappointing quarter."
   At the shareholder meeting, Mr. Allen defended the
company's previously reported decision to withdraw its
funding of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. AT&amp;T
announced the move on March 26 following pressure applied on
the company by shareholding anti-abortion activists.
   Referring to protests by Planned Parenthood, Mr. Allen
said: "I'm disappointed in their actions. If someone were
supporting me for 25 years, I would say `thank you.' In the
last 25 years, we funded them to the tune of $600,000, and we
never heard a word of thanks from them."
   Mr. Allen added that AT&amp;T will spend $2.5 million this
year supporting teen-pregnancy prevention programs similar to
those they had been supporting at Planned Parenthood.
   Mr. Allen said Planned Parenthood has elevated the
abortion issue to political advocacy and that "this caused
our opponents and proponents to say that we are supporting
abortion. I concluded -- I should say the {AT&amp;T} foundation
concluded -- that abortion or opposing abortion shouldn't be
supported by the corporation."
   A first-time shareholder proposal that AT&amp;T stop funding
organizations that advocate abortion managed to win 5.5% of
the votes cast at the company's annual meeting, insuring its
inclusion on the ballot for a second time at AT&amp;T's 1991
meeting. Another resolution, calling on AT&amp;T to drop its
affirmative action program, garnered 8.8% of the vote, less
than the 10% it needed to be included for the fourth time
next year.
   AT&amp;T common stock fell $1 yesterday to close at $41 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
