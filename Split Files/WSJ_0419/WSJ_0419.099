   Ask a dozen researchers about the effects of airline
deregulation on fares, and you'll probably get a dozen
different answers.
   Since free enterprise in the skies entered its second
decade last year, at least 12 studies have tried to measure
its impact on fares. Though they may reach similar
conclusions on narrow points, the studies often clash on
broad issues: Some researchers pronounce deregulation a
smashing success, while others say consumer savings are
grossly exaggerated or nonexistent.

   That's because the studies give different weight to
different factors. The most widely used yardstick is what
airlines call "yield," or the price charged a passenger for
each mile of travel. But researchers also may consider such
variables as airlines' changing costs, the rise of
hub-and-spoke systems and the impact of deregulation on
different types of travelers.
   In the end, how researchers view deregulation may depend
on how they treat the following factors.
                                                                                                       

   What's the Time Frame
                                                                                                       

   Almost no one challenges the idea that deregulation
brought immediate benefit to the consumer. In the years after
the Civil Aeronautics Board stopped setting fares, carriers
slashed prices. New entrants flooded the market offering
bargain-basement prices.
   But most discount airlines have since vanished, and the
airline industry has grown more concentrated. As a result,
studies that look at the entire period of deregulation tend
to find greater benefits than those that examine a more
recent time frame.
   Even critics of deregulation agree that real, or
inflation-adjusted, fares remain lower today than they were
in 1978 -- the last year of regulation. As of 1988, the
latest year used by most studies, real fares were still 20%
lower than 10 years earlier, according to a Transportation
Department study.
   But by 1988, when the industry's merger wave peaked, real
fares had stopped falling. Carriers had largely gotten all
the cost-cutting they could out of wage reductions and more
efficient, bigger jets. Moreover, with fewer competitors
vying for passengers, the airlines were under less pressure
to sacrifice profit margins to defend their turf.
   From 1986 to 1988, real fares dropped only 1% to 3%. Since
then, they have been edging up. "The trend line of the last
few years is quite different from what happened immediately
after deregulation," says Severin Borenstein, an airline
economist at the University of California at Davis. "The
longtime trend in falling prices came to an end."
                                                                                                       

   Distribution of Benefits
                                                                                                       

   National averages for air fares don't reflect what's
happened in many cities. As airlines went out of business and
gobbled each other up, many cities were left with only one or
two major carriers. The lack of competition at these airports
-- including Atlanta, Denver and Pittsburgh -- has produced
hefty fare increases, some studies show.
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional research
arm, found in 1988 that a flight from one of 15 airports with
one or two dominant carriers cost an average of 27% more than
one from an airport with more carriers. In a similar
analysis, the Transportation Department found that fares in
1988 were 18.7% higher at concentrated airports.
                                                                                                       

   Capacity Constraints
                                                                                                       

   As more travelers have taken to the skies, some airports
-- including New York's La Guardia and Kennedy, Chicago's
O'Hare and Washington's National -- have reached their
capacity limits in the past few years.
   So, supply and demand in these places has put upward
pressure on prices. This might have happened regardless of
whether the industry was deregulated -- and thus can't
necessarily be counted against the concept of free
competition.
   An Air Transport Association study last year concluded
that fares at those four airports were 7% higher than
average. Tickets at Orange County, Calif.'s, airport, which
is cramped due to noise restrictions, cost 6% more than
average.
                                                                                                       

   Business Travelers
                                                                                                       

   Airline deregulation has been a better deal for vacation
travelers than for people who fly on business. Runzheimer
International Ltd., a Northbrook, Ill., research company,
examined unrestricted coach fares, commonly used by business
travelers, on 20 heavily traveled routes. Its index of fares
on these 20 routes rose 96% during the '80s. That figure
isn't adjusted for inflation, which totaled about 50% during
that period.
   Runzheimer's study didn't compare business fares on those
20 routes with fares commonly used by leisure travelers.
                                                                                                       

   Carrier's Cost
                                                                                                       

   Factors other than deregulation have put downward pressure
on air fares, according to some researchers. Over the past
decade, they say, airlines have benefited from lower fuel
prices and more fuel-efficient jets.
   A study financed by the Economic Policy Institute, a
nonprofit Washington, D.C., organization, concluded that
lower fuel prices account for three percentage points of the
22% inflation-adjusted drop in ticket prices that it
estimates occurred in the first 10 years after deregulation.
   The study also concluded that fares in the 10 years before
deregulation, adjusted for inflation and changes in fuel
prices, fell 24% -- more than the comparable 19% drop since
deregulation.
                                                                                                       

   Roundabout Routes
                                                                                                       

   Yield -- the amount charged customers for each mile flown
-- is one of the most common fare measures. In a study based
on this measure, the Congressional Budget Office said in 1988
that fares had fallen "significantly" since deregulation.
   Some researchers, however, argue that this is misleading.
They say many travelers now must fly farther to reach a given
destination because of hub-and-spoke systems that collect
passengers from different cities, funnel them to a central
airport and then put them on flights to their final
destinations.
   The Economic Policy Institute says travelers now fly 5% to
30% farther than before deregulation, when flights were more
direct. So, yield can decline even though passengers are
paying more for their tickets. Taking increased circuity into
account, the institute argues, real fares actually rose 8% to
33% in the first decade of deregulation. There is, however,
little detailed research on this.
                                                                                                       

   The Bottom Line
                                                                                                       

   One piece of evidence that suggests passengers haven't
been gouged by carriers since deregulation is industry
profitability. If carriers were practicing oligopolistic
pricing, then presumably it would show up on their bottom
lines. So far, it hasn't happened.
   During the past two years, airlines were supposed to reap
the benefits of industry consolidation. But their average
profit margins in those years were only 1.8% and 0.4%,
respectively, according to Value Line Inc. -- well below the
average for most industries.
                                                                                                       

   Customer Value
                                                                                                       

   Fares may have declined -- but what do you get for your
money these days?
   Many travelers would probably consider this one of the
most important questions about deregulation -- yet, perhaps
because it's so subjective, studies overlook it.
   In the race to slash costs, airlines have jammed more
seats onto planes, shrunk flight crews and cut corners on
in-flight services such as meals. They have made it harder
for travelers to change reservations on some discount
tickets.
   It would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure what
this adds up to in terms of reduced value -- and to what
extent it offsets the $6 billion that Brookings Institution
analysts believe deregulation has saved travelers. The
Brookings analysts subtracted $500 million a year from
consumer savings as the cost of increased flight delays. But
they didn't account for other negative factors.
