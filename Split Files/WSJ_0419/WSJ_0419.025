   Investors' enormous thirst for Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo
shares may finally have been quenched.
   Some money managers say the stocks have become too
high-priced, even while many brokerage house analysts
continue to recommend them.

   A few managers say Coke and Pepsi have become today's
equivalent of the wildly popular "one-decision stocks" of
1972. And that, they say, is a sign of trouble not just for
the two companies' shares, but for the stock market as a
whole.
   Both soft-drink makers have been among the strongest
performing stocks for more than a year. Coca-Cola has fizzed
up 78% and PepsiCo 68% since the start of 1989. Yesterday's
closing prices of 79 1/4 for Coca-Cola and 66 3/8 for PepsiCo
were off two points from the companies' all-time highs,
reached last week.
   Back in 1972, investors raved about the "Nifty Fifty," a
small band of high-quality growth stocks that investors
supposedly could buy and put away for the long haul. (Only
"one decision" was needed -- to buy them.)
   Companies such as Xerox, International Business Machines
Corp. and McDonald's were among the favored few at the time
and were bid up to sky-high multiples of 40 to 60 times the
companies' earnings. As businesses, the companies operated
superbly in the 1970s. But as stocks, they were miserable
flops because investors had overpaid for their expectations
of high growth.
   Coca-Cola and PepsiCo haven't reached the sky-high
valuations that prevailed back then. But Coca-Cola is selling
for 24 times the past 12 months' earnings and PepsiCo's
multiple is 20. It has been more than 15 years since the
soft-drink stocks (PepsiCo is also big in snack foods and
restaurants) sold at such high multiples.
   The pair have been investor favorites because of their
strong and steady growth, recession resistance and prospects
for further international expansion. According to Coca-Cola,
Americans consume 283 eight-ounce servings of its soft drinks
per person a year. By contrast, German consumers drink 167
servings, Italians 80 servings and the Chinese 0.4 serving.
   Other news has also boosted the stocks. Coke may have been
traded up in anticipation of a 2-for-1 stock split, which
holders approved yesterday at the company's annual meeting.
Also yesterday, Coke reported a healthy 15% increase in
first-quarter per-share earnings. Pepsi is expected to report
a gain of at least 13% when it releases first-quarter
results. Most analysts expect earnings gains for both
companies of at least 12% this year.
   What's more, last year's purchase of a 6% Coca-Cola stake
by investing legend Warren E. Buffett has had a halo effect.
"Buffett owns it, and he's got that mystique," says Kyle
Krueger, senior vice president of Eagle Asset Management Inc.
in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Mr. Buffett couldn't be reached for
comment.)
   But Mr. Krueger wouldn't touch the stocks. "We think at
this level Coke is overpriced. Pepsi as well," he says. The
enthusiasm for the stocks on Wall Street strikes him as an
example of analysts' tendency to recommend what's already
gone up. Just this week, he says, he was visited by an
analyst who disdained PepsiCo five years ago at far lower
prices, but now calls it "one of the best-managed companies
in America."
   One New York money manager who both buys stocks and sells
them short (betting on a price decline) says he won't buy
Coke or Pepsi because they're overpriced. But he wouldn't
consider short-selling them either, because they are
high-quality companies and business prospects look good.
   In response to such comments, Roberto C. Goizueta,
chairman and chief executive officer of Coke, said yesterday,
"Coca-Cola's stock is always cheap. I have yet to meet an
investor who hasn't increased his wealth by putting his money
on KO," the company's stock symbol. A company spokesman added
that the company's purchase of eight million shares of its
own stock during the past five months is an expression of
confidence in the stocks's value.
   A PepsiCo spokesman said: "We haven't seen any indications
that we're getting pricey." Some key analysts have recently
raised their year-end earnings estimates for PepsiCo and a
couple have changed their hold recommendations to buy, the
spokesman said. "The sense we get from analysts is that
there's a high degree of comfort out there."
   However, analysts' enthusiasm isn't a guarantee that a
stock will perform well. Research by Sasho Dalov, publisher
of Wall Street Wire, a market analysis service, indicates
that stocks recommended by large numbers of brokerage houses
usually underperform the market. By his tally, 13 brokerage
houses were recently recommending PepsiCo and eight were
recommending Coca-Cola.
   Institutional Capital Inc. of Chicago sold its entire
holding of more than 600,000 PepsiCo shares last year. "It
had done what we wanted it to do," says William Maloney,
chief investment officer. Cautious about the market (partly
because of rising interest rates), the firm has been raising
cash, and chose to sell first those stocks with prices that
were high compared with earnings.
   Roy Burry, a Kidder Peabody analyst, isn't recommending
either stock. He thinks they have gotten a little pricey as
enthusiasm spreads for companies with an international
flavor. "Global is a hot buzzword these days," he says.
   To be sure, the soda stocks still attract plenty of
enthusiasm. Martin Romm of First Boston recommends both, and
says they'll benefit from recent turbulence in the Japanese
market. "Investors are looking for the safety of
tried-and-true companies," he says.
   "These are very desirable stocks when the economy slows,"
adds John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities
Inc. "The main downside is the market. If there's a crack
somewhere along the line, everybody suffers." Mr. Maxwell
believes Coke shares will reach $100 or more in the next 18
months, while Pepsi could be up in the 80s over the same
period.
   Roger Engemann, a Pasadena, Calif., money manager, owns
both Coke and Pepsi. Based on his firm's growth estimates, he
thinks Coca-Cola should sell for 106 by year end and PepsiCo
should sell for 91. "What we're looking for is companies that
we can just put away for five years," he says. "These brand
names are supervaluable things."
   Emanuel Goldman, analyst at PaineWebber, has long been a
fan of both Coke and Pepsi. "You have to search far and wide
to find stocks with their characteristics," including a clear
business strategy and "the ability to deliver earnings
short-term and long-term."
   Certain money managers are uneasy about the outlook for
the market because investor enthusiasm is so narrowly focused
on a few favorites such as the soda stocks, Philip Morris and
Federal National Mortgage Association. "The similarities to
1973 are eerie," says Mark Perkins, chairman of Perkins
Smith, a securities firm in Tampa, Fla. "There are stocks
that everybody wants to own, and there's everything else."
   Mr. Perkins also sees other similarities between today's
stock market and that of 1973. Then, banks had problems with
bad loans to real estate investment trusts. Today, banks have
problems with bad loans to real estate developers. In 1973,
the problems helped bring on a credit crunch, and he thinks
the same thing could happen again.
   In 1973, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was struggling
to pass the 1000 mark for the third time (the first two were
in 1966 and 1969). Today, the industrial average is near its
peaks of 1987 and 1989. In each case, Mr. Perkins discerns a
"triple top," a formation that technical analysts say is a
sign of trouble.
   Trouble did follow in 1973-74. Stocks entered the
third-worst bear market in history, which ultimately carried
stock prices down 45%. Of course, no one knows what the
market will do, but Mr. Perkins is battening down the
hatches. He has accumulated more than a 50% cash position,
and is short selling some high-flying small stocks.
