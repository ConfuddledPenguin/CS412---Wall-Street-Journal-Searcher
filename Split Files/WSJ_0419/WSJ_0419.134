   Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, Calif., said it posted a
first-quarter loss of $1 million, or four cents a share, as
revenue plummeted 37% to $57 million. The company cited
continuing slumping sales resulting from delays in the
introduction of its upgraded version of dBASE IV, a computer
spreadsheet program.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the software maker had a
profit of $11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of
$89.8 million.

   The results had been expected. The firm in 1989 had a loss
of $28.7 million largely because of glitches in developing
the dBASE upgrade. Ashton-Tate said it still can't give a
delivery date for the upgrade, which many analysts had hoped
would be ready during the 1990 first quarter.
   "Many customers have delayed their purchases of dBASE IV
in anticipation of the shipment of the new version,"
Ashton-Tate said. It said it believes "this trend will
continue" until shipment of the updated version.
