   NEW YORK -- Federal regulators closed Seamen's Corp.'s
Seamen's Bank for Savings, one of New York's oldest thrifts,
and approved the transfer of 13 branches and $2.1 billion in
deposits to Chase Manhattan Corp., effective today.
   Chase, which will operate the branches as part of its
Chase Manhattan Bank, agreed to pay the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. $5 million for 161-year-old Seamen's
deposits, which represent 169,800 accounts.

   As part of the transaction, the FDIC has agreed to offer a
$2.1 billion short-term note to Chase, repay secured
borrowings of $450 million and retain assets of the failed
bank, chiefly mortgage-backed securities, totaling $2.4
billion.
   Late last year, the American Stock Exchange delisted
Seamen's, after the thrift reported a negative net worth of
$66 million. For its last publicly reported period, the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 1989, Seamen's reported a loss of $168
million, or $7.18 a share.
   For 1988, Seamen's reported earnings of $16.5 million, or
$1.02 a share, down 10% from $18.3 million, or $1.10 a share,
in 1987.
   In 1984, a group of Texas investors injected $75 million
of capital into the troubled mutual savings bank and
converted it to public ownership in 1985. The three
individuals -- Robert T. Enloe, Robert K. Utley and Jess Hay
-- together controlled 69% of the company's stock.
   In 1985, Seamen's shifted its strategy from the
traditional thrift role of originating residential mortgages
to one of investing in mortgage-backed securities, building
up a huge $3.5 billion portfolio. As part of that strategy,
Seamen's placed complicated hedges using mortgage-related
derivative securities on the portfolio to protect its income
from rising interest rates.
   However, those hedges relied on short-term interest rates
keeping their historical relationship to long-term rates.
That relationship changed, and Seamen's found itself paying
consumers more for their deposits.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chase Manhattan shares closed at $27.25, down 50
cents.
