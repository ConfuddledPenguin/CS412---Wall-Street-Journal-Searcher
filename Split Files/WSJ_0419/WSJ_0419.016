   BEIJING -- The whole world was watching in May when Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev made his historic visit to Beijing,
ending 30 years of estrangement between China and the Soviet
Union.
   On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Peng flies to Moscow to
begin what should have been an historic reciprocal visit. But
this time, no one is taking much notice.

   Sino-Soviet rapprochement once loomed as a momentous
strategic advance and an ominous threat to Western security.
But now that normal ties are resuming, the relationship seems
harmless, even irrelevant to the major issues facing the
world.
   Chinese attempts to wrest concessions from the West by
playing the so-called Soviet card won't succeed, Western
diplomats say. The two communist neighbors are far apart
ideologically and have relatively little to offer each other
in strategic or economic terms. Both sides have too much at
stake in their relationship with the West.
   "It's remarkable," says a senior Western diplomat.
"China's top government official is going to Moscow, the two
sides increasingly are engaged in military cooperation -- and
no one even cares."
   Such a relaxed attitude is a product mainly of China's
retreat from the world stage. The momentous global events of
the past year have largely left China behind. After violently
suppressing its pro-democracy movement in June, soon after
Mr. Gorbachev's return to Moscow, Beijing's leaders have
watched uncomfortably as communist nations around the world
have yielded to the popular forces of political pluralism and
economic freedom.
   China's old guard still rules out such reform, and finds
itself in international semi-isolation as a result. Beijing's
leaders are publicly hostile toward the capitalist West and
privately critical of the rapidly reforming Soviet bloc. In
such a strained context, there isn't likely to be much
progress in Sino-Soviet ties during Mr. Li's four-day trip to
Moscow and Leningrad.
   On the other hand, the two sides seem intent on not
letting the new ideological gulf derail the renewed
relationship. Despite mutual suspicion, Moscow and Beijing
are careful not to say anything in public to poison
relations. Soviet diplomats, to cite one example, now praise
the Russian-speaking ability of the Soviet-trained Mr. Li;
they used to ridicule it.
   The visit is likely to be much smoother than the last time
a Chinese premier visited Moscow. In 1961, when the two sides
had already broken off most contacts, Chou En-lai attended a
Soviet Party congress. Mr. Chou pointedly refused to meet
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and criticized his Soviet
hosts as Marxist "revisionists."
   This time, "both sides are trying to keep things relaxed,"
says a Soviet Embassy source in Beijing. "The only hope for
the relationship is if both sides avoid trying to teach the
other how to run their country, or what socialism really
means."
   But tension still is evident. In private discussions with
foreign leaders and in internal Communist Party documents,
China has savaged Mr. Gorbachev and the reforms he has
fostered. The Chinese began to tone down that rhetoric only
recently, sources say, after Mr. Gorbachev strengthened his
position during a February party plenum in Moscow.
   Prior to that plenum, diplomats say, China had been
betting that Mr. Gorbachev would fall, and be succeeded
either by the conservative Politburo member Yegor Ligachev or
the centrist premier, Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   "Their intelligence and their guesswork were wrong," says
a Western diplomat. "They actually expected Gorbachev to get
canned."
   For Mr. Li, the trip offers a chance to bolster his
sagging prestige. At the very least, the voyage will shelve
speculation that he is to be sacrificed to placate critics in
China and abroad who hold him responsible for June's
Tiananmen massacre and who view him as an obstacle to
economic and political reform.
   Mr. Li's trip also promises to be an awkward homecoming.
The 61-year-old premier studied at the Moscow Power Institute
from 1948 to 1954. He was nurtured during the Stalinist era
and, diplomats say, still thinks the state should control
society tightly from the top. But the Soviet Union today is a
radically different place from the one in which Mr. Li
studied.
   In a recent meeting with Soviet journalists in Beijing,
Mr. Li seemed to concede how much things are changing. "Even
if your people think that socialism is no longer the ideal
system for the Soviet Union, our basic policy will still be
aimed at preserving normal state relations," he said.
   Soviet glasnost already is making the Chinese
uncomfortable. New, independent Soviet magazines sometimes
criticize the Tiananmen massacre and China's resistance to
political liberalization. An article in Moscow's
Literaturnaya Gazeta, a magazine Mr. Li himself reads
regularly, recently carried a sympathetic interview with the
Dalai Lama, the self-exiled spiritual leader of
Chinese-occupied Tibet. China protested to Soviet officials,
who responded by saying that, unlike in China, the state no
longer has the power or desire to control every publication.
   Moreover, there are concerns that many Soviet citizens
don't welcome Mr. Li's visit. When Mr. Gorbachev came to
Beijing, he walked into the middle of vast student-led
demonstrations. Some of the protesters greeted the Soviet
leader as a champion of reform, and welcomed him with banners
in Russian. By contrast, Soviet sources say, Mr. Li could
even encounter a few jeers and protest banners.
   While the visit probably won't produce breakthroughs, the
two sides are likely to sign several agreements. The most
important is a planned "confidence-building" agreement in
principle to reduce the presence of troops along the shared
4,200-mile border. But the two sides won't even try to
address the thornier historical question of exactly where
that border should be drawn.
   On the economic front, they also are likely to sign a
trade agreement. But Moscow and Beijing earlier agreed that,
beginning next year, trade should be on a cash basis, not by
bartering goods. As a result, two-way trade between the
cash-strapped nations is likely to significantly decline from
its current annual level of about $2.4 billion.
