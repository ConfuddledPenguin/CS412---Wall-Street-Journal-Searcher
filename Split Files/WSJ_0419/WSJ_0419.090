   The environmental movement has come a long way since Earth
Day, 1970. Membership and revenues have grown by leaps and
bounds, as the nearby table shows. Membership in the
Wilderness Society has multiplied by eight; the Sierra Club
and the National Audubon Society have seen their memberships
quintuple. The National Wildlife Federation's revenues have
grown tenfold.
   Altogether, the revenues of the dozen largest
environmental groups amount to roughly $250 million a year.
And that doesn't include the revenues of the research outfits
that provide the analysis that fuels the environmentalists'
political activity -- big groups such as the World Resources
Institute and Worldwatch Institute, or the myriad of smaller
activist groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and
Friends of the Earth.

   All that money has bought less environmental improvement
than it could have. The major environmental groups are
committed to protecting the environment by exerting political
pressure to change statutes, court interpretations of
statutes and executive branch regulations. The tax laws
require that they limit their spending on direct lobbying to
20% of their revenues, but in essence their entire program
budget is designed to change government laws and practices.
Typically, this effort represents close to 75% of their total
budget.
   There are some exceptions, of course, mostly among
old-line organizations that continue programs started years
ago. The National Audubon Society, for example, devotes 14%
of its $34 million in revenues to managing its wildlife
sanctuaries, and the National Wildlife Federation spends at
least $11 million on children's nature education. For the
most part, however, the leading environmental organizations
lobby for current political change.
   The trouble with this strategy is that it can only be a
constant battle. Even though environmentalists list with
pride the vast number of environmental laws passed over the
past two decades -- from the Clean Air Act and its amendments
to Superfund and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
-- they recognize that most are poorly implemented. They are
constantly going to court to force the Environmental
Protection Agency or the Forest Service to follow the law as
they see it. Often, their legislative achievements are
undermined in the congressional appropriations process or by
agencies of the executive branch that heed livestock owners
or timber producers more than environmentalists.
   Lobbying is not just costly; it never ends. As the cliche
would have it: you can't buy a vote, you can only rent it.
One Congress can establish a wilderness, but the next has the
legal right to turn it into a nuclear waste facility.
   Those who weren't adults at the time of the first Earth
Day may find it hard to believe that a reversal of
environmentalism is possible; protecting the environment has
been politically popular for nearly two decades. They won't
remember that the state government of Pennsylvania used to
have bounties on hawks, that Oregon was officially committed
to wiping out the sea lion and that during the 1960s the
Interior Department considered damming the Grand Canyon.
Political tides ebb as well as flow.
   If environmental groups really want to save endangered
species and tropical rainforest, they would do well to
consider applying their ample revenues to purchasing land or
protective easements. Using some of their funds for purchase
could give them a permanent impact that is elusive today.
   Consider the Wilderness Society's effort to get the
government to stop below-cost timber sales. On the theory
that the worst boondoggles should be the easiest to overturn,
the society has been attacking logging in Alaska's Tongass
National Forest. If the society's figures are correct,
logging the Tongass is economically unjustified: It maintains
that timber-cutting on the Tongass loses between 29 cents and
93 cents for every taxpayer dollar spent. Yet a 1980 law
requires the government to spend $40 million a year, if
necessary, to support Tongass timber jobs. At 1,800 jobs (the
Wilderness Society's estimate), that is more than $20,000 per
job per year.
   So far, the Wilderness Society's lobbying has accomplished
little. So why doesn't the society buy the land it wants to
protect? Although the Tongass is vast (the Forest Service
owns more than 16 million acres), fewer than 100,000 acres of
the critical old-growth forest is high-volume commercial
timber, according to the society's report. Arranging a
purchase deal wouldn't be easy; but the payoff would be title
to a deed, not just another chance to fight the battle again
next year. Since the government is losing millions of dollars
each year on the Tongass anyway, it could, after selling the
loggable land to the society, divert just two years of its
subsidy budget to buy out the mill owners and pay the workers
generous severance pay, saving the taxpayer money from then
on.
   The Nature Conservancy, which does take a market approach,
just made a much larger purchase than the critical Tongass
acreage, acquiring more than 300,000 acres in New Mexico for
a price said to be between $16 million and $20 million. This
is a lot of money, but, by obtaining title, the Conservancy
will not have to persuade a continual string of Congresses to
manage the land as wilderness.
   The Nature Conservancy has been using markets since 1951
and now owns and manages nearly 2.6 million acres of land
selected to preserve endangered wildlife or plants. Hundreds
of other land trusts around the country are working quietly,
with little fanfare, to protect land, usually through the
purchase or donation of land and conservation easements.
Ducks Unlimited, for example, spends $30 million a year to
lease or purchase conservation easements and to create
wetlands.
   Plenty of land is available for purchase by conservation
groups. Most wild areas are not attractive for commercial
development. Brent Haglund, president of the Sand County
Foundation in Madison, Wisc., says that wilderness-quality
areas in Wisconsin are available for between $100 and $200 an
acre. "I'd like to see some private groups secure parcels of
5,000 acres, remove evidence of man's disturbance and create
private wilderness tracts," he says. Indeed, Mr. Haglund's
Sand County Foundation is re-creating a wilderness-like area
on its Leopold Reserve, the place in Wisconsin where envi
ronmentalist Aldo Leopold wrote his Sand County Al manac in
the 1930s and '40s. Out West, the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation recently helped negotiate a purchase (most of it
ultimately paid for by government) of prime elk habitat that
averaged about $800 an acre.
   Purchase is especially promising for tropical forests. A
recent study published in Nature magazine pointed out that
tropical forestlands in Peru, now worth about $200 an acre
when used for timber pro duction, could be worth far more if
local people harvested fruits, latex and other indigenous
crops on a sustainable basis. A conservation organization, or
even a speculator in genetic resources, could buy the land
and rent it to the local inhabitants. Indeed, part of its
payment to the government for title could be transferable
permits giving local people sustainable harvest rights.
   Ecologist Norman Myers estimates that genetic resources
represent a $40 billion market today in medical and
pharmaceutical products. If he is correct, the acquisition of
unique, indigenous plant and animal genetic stocks offers the
possibility for great future reward. Roger Sedjo, an
economist with Resources for the Future, says that holding a
piece of tropical forest is "like holding a lottery ticket"
-- one could be a big winner.
   The World Wildlife Fund has already begun to use some of
its resources for "debt-for-nature" swaps, in which it
purchases a portion of a country's debt in return for the
government's promise to use the funds to protect tropical
lands. The swaps are fraught with difficulties, WWF officials
concede. It's time for the fund to try to take the more
permanent step of obtaining title to the land.
   In sum, those who work for preservation should consider
the market as a mechanism. The result will be far greater
security of ownership, not a continual bill for lobbying that
is never marked "paid."
