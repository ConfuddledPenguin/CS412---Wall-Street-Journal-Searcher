   LUND, Sweden -- Gambro AB said it extended the expiration
date of its $37-a-share, or $253 million, tender offer for
Cobe Laboratories Inc. until May 31. The offer was to have
expired yesterday.
   Gambro, a medical equipment producer, said it needs more
time to comply with Federal Trade Commission requests for
information under antitrust regulations. Gambro said
1,208,719 shares of Cobe, a medical equipment company, had
been tendered as of Tuesday.
