   Philip Morris Cos. earnings rose 31% in the first quarter
to $775 million, or 84 cents a share, powered by strong gains
in its core food, beer, and tobacco businesses.
   In the year-ago quarter, the nation's largest
packaged-goods maker earned $590 million, or 64 cents a
share. Revenue rose 7.3% to $11.38 billion from $10.6
billion.

   Analysts reacted favorably to the higher-than-expected
earnings, which were fueled by surprisingly robust results at
Philip Morris's domestic tobacco and Miller Brewing
operations. Many analysts had forecast earnings of around 78
cents a share for the quarter.
   "You become numb to Philip Morris's strong earnings gains,
but this was awesome," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. "This company wants cash flow to facilitate
their acquisition efforts."
   Added Marc Cohen of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.: "People
who were doubtful about this company's ability to continue to
grow given the industries in which it operates, as well as
its size, have reason to rethink their postitions."
   In the first quarter, Philip Morris's operating profit
rose 18% to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion. Although the
company doesn't break out operating profit by division, Mr.
Cohen of Sanford Bernstein estimated that operating profit
from the company's U.S. tobacco business rose 18% to about
$815 million. At a time when cigarette consumption is
declining about 3%, Philip Morris's unit volume grew about
0.4%. Overseas, the No. 1 tobacco maker's unit sales rose 8%.
   At Miller Brewing, unit sales grew a buoyant 4%, thanks in
large part to the company's recently introduced Genuine Draft
and further gains by Milwaukee's Best, a popular-priced beer.
   Operating profit at Kraft General Foods rose an estimated
15% to about $600 million, mostly due to cost savings in the
aftermath of Kraft's 1988 merger with Philip Morris. But
volume at the nation's largest food company was up only 2%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Philip
Morris closed at $42.625, down 37.5 cents, on volume of more
than 2.3 million shares.
