   Maxus Energy Corp. said it registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to offer nine million common shares
as part of a plan to restructure preferred stock held by
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   Under its agreement with Prudential, Dallas-based Maxus
said it plans to pay Prudential $67.5 million to repurchase
500,000 of the three million $9.75 cumulative convertible
preferred shares that Prudential owns and to make 750,000
additional shares non-convertible. The shares that won't be
convertible any longer will be entitled to an additional
annual dividend of $1 a share, Maxus said.

   Prudential also will receive a $1.5 million restructuring
fee. Further, the agreement would allow Prudential to elect
two directors, instead of the current three, to the Maxus
board. However, the insurance concern hasn't exercised its
right to elect Maxus directors.
   Maxus said the transaction will reduce its preferred
dividends and cut Prudential's stake in the firm's fully
diluted shares to about 11% from 18.5%. Maxus has about 90.8
million common shares outstanding.
