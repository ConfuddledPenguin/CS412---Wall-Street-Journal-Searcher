   SAN DIEGO -- Magma Power Co., which develops and sells
geothermal resources used to generate electric power, said it
received a request from J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., a New York bank
holding company, to exercise a warrant convertible into one
million Magma common shares.
   Pursuant to the request, Magma said it plans to file a
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to
register the shares. After the registration takes effect,
J.P. Morgan intends to exercise the warrant, said Magma,
which has about 22.1 million common shares outstanding.
