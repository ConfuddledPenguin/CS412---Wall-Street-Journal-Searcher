   Hyundai Group agreed to take part in the Soviet Union's $2
billion petrochemical complex project at Tobolsk in the West
Siberian lowland, officials said in Seoul, South Korea.
   Hyundai said the accord was reached between the Soviet
Petrochemical Industry Ministry and Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's
founder-honorary chairman. He returned home Tuesday after a
10-day trip to Moscow.

   The Hyundai officials quoted Mr. Chung as saying that
Hyundai will be awarded a $600 million contract to build a
polypropylene plant for the complex. They didn't say what
would be the plant's annual production capacity.
   The South Korean business conglomerate also agreed to
invest $30 million, or 5% of the capital of a joint venture
company to be set up to operate the complex, Mr. Chung said.
