   WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. agreed to recall 72,000 of
its 1983 vehicles, because they fail to meet federal
emissions standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The models being recalled have 2.2-liter engines and
manual transmissions. They include Plymouth Horizon, Turismo
and Reliant; Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries, 600ES and 400; and
Chrysler LeBaron.

   The agency said Chrysler will modify the cars to increase
the amount of air that enters the intake manifold, which is
between the combustion chamber and carburetor. This will
reduce the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons formed
in the combustion chamber, an EPA official said.
   Chrysler also will reset the ignition timing, so that the
fuel is ignited earlier, allowing it to burn longer and
resulting in more complete combustion and lower emissions,
the official said. In addition, he said, the company will
adjust the idle speed.
   A Chrysler spokesman said notification about the recall
has already been mailed. The company declined to say how much
the recall will cost.
   The spokesman for the auto maker said, "We've got to spiff
up the engine, so that we can meet the standards, which are
extremely stringent."
   The national emission standard for cars, established in
1981, permits the emission of 3.4 grams per mile of carbon
monoxide and 0.41 grams per mile of hydrocarbons, said an EPA
spokeswoman.
