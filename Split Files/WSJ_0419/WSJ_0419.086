   General Motors Corp. says it wants to bring back the
electric car to help save the planet, but it won't say
exactly when or how.
   Outgoing Chairman Roger B. Smith, in a bid to score points
with environmentalists and regulators, said the auto maker
will move ahead with plans for a mass-market,
electric-powered car.

   Earlier this year, GM unveiled an electric vehicle, the
"Impact," a sporty-looking show car. In a speech yesterday at
the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Smith wouldn't say
when GM might begin producing and marketing a vehicle like
the Impact, and he stopped short of promising that the
vehicle would ever reach production. "It will take some time
for all of the technical questions to be resolved," he said.
   Electric cars enjoyed a brief heyday during the early
years of the century. But after GM perfected the
self-starting gasoline engine, electric cars, with shorter
range and little power, virtually vanished from the market.
   But now GM and other auto makers are under pressure from
environmental regulators, mainly in California, to begin
offering electric cars or other "ultra-clean" vehicles by the
mid-1990s. To meet this deadline, GM would have to start
immediately to push a car project from the concept stage --
where the Impact is now -- to full production. GM typically
takes four to five years to develop a new model.
   GM has other incentives to build an electric car. Such a
vehicle could give the auto maker a boost in meeting federal
fuel economy regulations, particularly if Congress moves to
make them more stringent.
   In his speech, Mr. Smith linked GM's electric-car decision
to the environmental consciousness symbolized by Earth Day,
which takes place on Sunday. He mentioned the electric car as
one of a number of GM efforts to clean up its cars and
factories since the first Earth Day, in 1970.
   "Our goal is to be the first automobile company since the
early days of the auto industry to mass-produce an electric
car," Mr. Smith said. "We are taking a major step toward
helping our country meet its transportation needs and
environmental goals."
   Environmentalists heckled Mr. Smith's effort to wrap a
green mantle around GM. "This is just the latest example of
the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde style of corporate
environmentalism," said Robert Dewey of the Environmental
Action Foundation. Observing that the GM chairman declined to
say when the electric car would be built, Mr. Dewey declared
Mr. Smith's speech "long on rhetoric but short on details."
   California officials reacted more positively. A spokesman
for the state's air resources board said he was "encouraged"
by Mr. Smith's announcement. "We believe electric cars
definitely have a role to play in our plans to reduce
emissions."
   Whether a car such as Impact ever shows up in a GM
showroom will depend on a variety of factors, including the
auto maker's ability to build and sell electric cars at a
profit. In 1979, GM officials reacted to predictions of
$2-a-gallon gas by vowing to have electric cars in dealer
showrooms by the mid-1980s. By 1990, the company was to have
converted 10% of its total U.S. car fleet to electric power.
But these plans were shelved when gas prices fell, along with
demand for alternative-fuel vehicles.
   This time, GM officials say new technology could make a
commercially viable electric car possible. The
battery-powered Impact can be driven as far as 120 miles at
55 miles per hour on one charge, GM says. The car accelerates
from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 8 seconds, which puts Impact
in the same league as many of GM's current, gas-fueled
models.
   But GM officials caution there are still a lot of bugs to
work out. Impact's 120-mile range, although better than many
previous electric car prototypes, still may be too limited
for most consumers in sprawling cities such as Los Angeles.
Impact's batteries take about two hours to recharge.
   Further, although Impact doesn't spew fumes into the air,
its 870-pounds of lead-acid batteries could be an
environmental liability when an owner has to dispose of them.
What's more, Impact's batteries currently have a life span of
only 20,000 miles and cost roughly $1,500 to replace. GM
officials have said that the batteries would have to last at
least 50,000 miles for Impact to be as economical to operate
as a gas-powered car.
   Mr. Smith acknowledged that GM may need "a broad-based
development effort" to develop cheaper, more efficient
batteries for a production version of the car.
   Other auto makers are looking into the technology. Ford
Motor Co., which has been running a small experimental fleet
of electric-powered minivans in California, is studying
broader applications of the technology. But Ford officials
say they don't see a big market for such cars in the U.S.
