   JACKSON, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said first-quarter
earnings fell 2.8% to $103.3 million, or $1.27 a share, from
$106.3 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell 5.7% to $870.1 million from $922.6 million.
   The Jackson, Mich., utility concern said the earnings
decline resulted primarily from lower electric and natural
gas sales because of unusually warm winter weather. The first
quarter of 1990 was the warmest in lower Michigan in 69
years, the company said.

   CMS said the warm weather reduced net income by $7.3
million, or nine cents a share. This was partially offset by
benefits from the company's stock buy-back program. CMS said
it continues to buy back stock under a previously announced
program.
   William T. McCormick, Jr., CMS chairman, said the utility
company is sticking with a forecast calling for 1990 earnings
to outstrip the $3.80 a share achieved in 1989. But 1990 net
could be lower in the event of possible non-cash, one-time
write-offs associated with regulatory matters arising from
CMS's Midland ventures.
   In 1984 CMS abandoned a nuclear plant project in Midland,
Mich., after spending $4.1 billion on construction. But CMS
converted the failed nuclear plant to a gas-fired
cogeneration facility, which recently began commercial
operation. CMS has a 49% interest in the cogeneration
facility.
   CMS stock rose 75 cents yesterday to close at $30 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
