   Most investors are familiar with money-market funds and
long-term bond funds. But many have given hardly any thought
to the short-term funds that lie between the two extremes.
   Those often-overlooked investments may be a timely choice
for a portion of the vast sums now parked in money funds,
some financial advisers say.

   Yield is one reason. Short-term bond funds, which invest
in securities with maturities of one to five years, currently
offer yields that are around half a percentage point higher
than those of money funds.
   But a bigger reason to consider shifting some money-fund
dollars into short-term funds is that they return a lot more
than money funds when interest rates fall. And despite this
week's rise in rates, many financial advisers say the the
longer-term outlook is still for lower rates.
   "The risk in being in money funds at this point is that
you could see your income drop by 15% to 25%" over the next
year, says Hugh R. Lamle, executive vice president of money
manager M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. in New York.
"People who are dependent on that income are taking a risk
that they may not be aware of."
   The monthly income delivered by short-term funds doesn't
decline as rapidly as money-fund payouts when interest rates
fall, because of the longer maturities of the investments in
their portfolios. Investors who sell their shares after a
rate drop are also likely to reap a profit.
   Still, the short-term bond funds involve risks not found
in money funds. Investors who don't understand the
differences could be in for "an unpleasant surprise," says
Timothy C. Medley, a Jackson, Miss., money manager.
   While money funds are designed to maintain a fixed,
$1-a-share price, the share prices of bond funds fluctuate,
rising when interest rates fall, and falling when interest
rates rise. Although the prices of short-term funds vary much
less than the prices of long-maturity funds, the swings can
be painful. As a result, short-term bond funds underperform
money funds in some periods of rising rates.
   Indeed, that's exactly what happened in the first quarter
of this year, figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. show. The average short-term bond fund returned only
0.94% -- half the 1.89% delivered by the average money-market
fund. (Over the same quarter, long-term bond funds had losses
of 1.36%.)
   The short-term bond funds also lagged money funds over the
past three years. But they were winners over the past one
year and over five years.
   A number of financial advisers and money managers have
stepped up their use of short-term bond investments because
they expect rates to fall. For instance, Bailard, Biehl &amp;
Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment adviser, is using
funds with three-year to five-year maturities for about a
third of the client dollars earmarked for "cash equivalents."
   Individual investors who don't have a strong conviction
about rate trends might want to consider short-term bond
funds for some of the dollars they expect to keep in money
funds for at least several years. With a long time horizon,
it's more likely investors will be rewarded with higher
returns for taking the added price risk of the short-term
bond funds.
   Extending maturities can be even more remunerative with
tax-exempt municipal securities, says Ian MacKinnon, a senior
vice president at Vanguard Group of Investment Cos., Valley
Forge, Pa. That's because tax-exempt rates usually rise more
steeply than taxable rates as investors extend maturities.
   Over the past year, the Lipper numbers show, short-term
taxable funds outperformed taxable money funds by just over
three-quarters of a percentage point -- 9.37% vs. 8.58%. But
with tax-exempt investments, the short-term bond funds'
advantage was more than one and a half percentage points -- a
total return of 7.47% vs. 5.82% for tax-exempt money funds.
   Like money funds, short-term bond funds generally allow
investors to get at their money just by writing a check. But
investors who plan to write a lot of checks should stay away
from short-term bond funds. Because bond-fund share prices
fluctuates, each check written is likely to produce a taxable
gain or loss. "It can be a record-keeping nightmare," Mr.
MacKinnon says.
   Some financial advisers decry the use of short-term bond
funds as a money-fund substitute. "Short-term bond funds and
money-market funds are two completely different animals," one
an investment and the other a savings vehicle, says John T.
Blankinship Jr., a Del Mar, Calif., financial planner.
   Mr. Blankinship currently likes the short-term funds as
investments, however. "With a decrease in interest rates, you
should easily get a double-digit return" over the next year,
he says.
   Similarly Mr. Medley, the Jackson, Miss., money manager,
says he regularly uses bond funds with average maturities in
the 1.5-to-6 year range for the bond portion of his
portfolios. Over the past several decades, he notes,
five-year bonds have performed about the same as longer
securities -- and with less variability.
   "Once in a lifetime you'll have a bond market rally like
1982," when long-term Treasury bonds produced a 40% total
return, Mr. Medley says. "But generally, we've found
long-term bonds are just not worth the risk."
