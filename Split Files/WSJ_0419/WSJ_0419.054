   Like many comedians, the French actor Michel Blanc often
hints at the sadness lurking just behind his apple cheeks. He
is wonderfully sad in "Monsieur Hire," a French mystery about
an odd little tailor whose main pleasures in life are bowling
and voyeurism.
   Bowling, however, plays only a small part in this very
cool, very bleak adaptation of Georges Simenon's novel, "The
Betrothals of Mr. Hire." Like so many film makers before him,
it is the voyeurism that commanded the attention of director
Patrice Leconte, who until now has devoted himself mainly to
light comedy. Actually, Mr. Leconte was inspired by
"Panique," the 1946 film version of the Simenon novel, making
his movie an adaptation of an adaptation -- which may help
account for its occasional lapses in coherence.

   Mr. Hire is suspected of murder. This information comes
early, in a somewhat oblique way, from the investigation
conducted by the unnamed police inspector played by Andre
Wilms. Presumably this inspector is modeled on Simenon's
Inspector Maigret, though his obsession with this particular
murder, and with Mr. Hire, are never really explained.
   What makes Mr. Hire a suspect are two facts: The victim, a
young woman whose ethereal dead face fills the opening frames
of the film, lived near the reclusive tailor. And Mr. Hire is
not only reclusive, he has a brooding quality that makes his
simplest actions seem potentially sinister. Even his
apparently innocent encounters with a child who lives in his
building seem ominous.
   "What do you do to make people detest you?" the inspector
asks him.
   "I'm not chatty," says Mr. Hire. Mr. Blanc, small and
balding with large dark eyes, presents a convincing and
unnerving portrayal of a man who either is a pitiable loner
or a pervert. Every day he stares out his window into the
apartment across the way, at the lovely young woman who lives
there. He watches her all the time. He sees her dress and
undress, read in bed, embrace her lover.
   Whether he's watching her or not, it is impossible to read
the expression on his face. But his manner, his face,
everything about him breeds uneasy feelings, not unlike the
mixture of sensations set off by the approach of a beggar.
Does he deserve hostility or sympathy?
   The film makers keep adding information about Mr. Hire
purposely designed to make him more, not less inscrutable. He
regularly visits prostitutes whom he bores and confuses with
long bitter stories about nice little old ladies who poison
pigeons. He prides himself on being unobtrusive, which he
probably would be if, like so many self-designed loners, he
didn't imagine himself to be the focus of other people's
attention. "Do you want my photograph?" he snarls at
neighbors idly watching him coming and going.
   Before Mr. Hire can confess his infatuation to Alice, she
catches him spying on her. As it turns out, Alice not only
doesn't mind him looking at her, she likes it. Sandrine
Bonnaire, the interesting young actress who plays Alice, has
an appropriately mysterious aura, and in this kind of film,
aura is usually all a girl can hope for.
   There is a kind of chilly perfection in the remoteness
that pervades this film, from the characterizations to the
stark, somber imagery. Wear a sweater.

   The French director Coline Serreau, born into an acting
family, has spent time as an organist, a trapeze artist, an
actress, a writer and a movie director. This may explain why
her movies have such peripatetic plots.
   She also has an intuitive sense of what masses of people
will find funny, as she demonstrated in "Three Men and a
Cradle," a successful film that was even more successful in
its Americanized remake, "Three Men and a Baby."
   Now, with "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed" she once again
combines her slick commercial in tuition with a loopy
sensibility to produce this romance between a conventional
yuppie careerist (who's married, white and the fa ther of
two) and the black woman who cleans his office.
   The problem with this Romeo and Juliet story (in French
the film is titled "Romuald et Juliette") is that Daniel
Auteuil's businessman seems far too egocentric and
disagreeable to be so easily converted to niceness by the
earthy, worthy Juliette (played by Firmine Richard, in her
first screen role). This is, after all, a woman who goes
through husbands the way a child goes through Pampers: She
needs them when she needs them but they are eminently
disposable once they've served their purpose.
   The purpose of Juliette's husbands was to provide her with
the many cute children crowded into her tiny apartment, and
to appear now and then for comic relief. She wins her Romuald
by helping him conquer the corrupt corporate colleagues whose
shenanigans provide the complex farcical subplot. Along the
way he comes to see the worthlessness of his value system. On
the other hand, Juliette's reward for her nobility is being
elevated out of the poverty level into a comfortable
upper-class life.
   Perhaps this inconsistency will be cleared up in the
American version, which Ms. Serreau reportedly is preparing
for Disney Co.

   VIDEO TIPS: The interaction between voyeur and subject has
been done before "Monsieur Hire," and better. Louis Malle,
for example, used a similar trick to lead into much more
fascinating territory in his superb film, "Atlantic City."
And then, of course, there's the classic film on the subject
of peeping tomism, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window."
