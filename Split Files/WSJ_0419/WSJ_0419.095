   The chemical industry continues to be battered by
generally weak commodity prices, but other factors
contributed to widely varying first-quarter results at three
companies.
   Rohm &amp; Haas Co. reported that net income increased 2%,
which was significantly better than expected. The gain came
on increased plant operating efficiencies and lower propylene
costs.

   Quantum Chemical Corp.'s earnings, which dropped 92%, were
below expectations as a result of weak commodity prices, a
plant shutdown and reduced propane sales caused by warm
weather.
   Ethyl Corp.'s profit, which dropped 7%, was consistent
with expectations, with higher insurance segment income
making up for lower chemical profits.
   Philadelphia-based Rohm &amp; Haas said first-quarter results
reflected modest sales increases, smoother plant operations
and a favorable litigation settlement with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.
Sales increased 2.2% to $694.4 million from $679.5 million.
Analyst James Wilbur of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said
Rohm &amp; Haas earnings were "significantly better" than an
expected 65 cents a share, reflecting successful efforts to
reduce manufacturing costs. William R. Young of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. said he will probably
increase by 20 cents a share his 1990 earnings estimate of
$2.40 a share.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Rohm &amp; Haas shares closed at $33.75, down 37.5 cents.
   Quantum Chemical, based in New York, said first-quarter
results were hurt by lower selling prices for polyethylene
and polypropylene and by lower propane sales volume. Costs
exceeding insurance recoveries for a fire-related plant
shutdown reduced earnings by $15 million, or 59 cents a
share. Sales dropped 16% to $682.8 million from $814.1
million.
   Analyst George Krug of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said Quantum
earnings were "somewhat below" the expected range of 30 cents
to 80 cents a share. Charles LoCastro of Donaldson Lufkin
said he is considering lowering his current 1990 profit
estimate of $2.25 a share because second and third-quarter
earnings are likely to be lower than first-quarter net.
   Quantum shares closed at $22.25, down 62.5 cents, in Big
Board trading.
   Ethyl, of Richmond, Va., said income from continuing
operations increased 2.6%, reflecting a 24% increase in
insurance segment operating profit. Chemical earnings
declined 6% as a result of sharply reduced shipments of
anti-knock chemicals. Sales were up 6.9% to $609.7 million
from $570.5 million. Analysts said earnings were consistent
with estimates in the range of 44 to 45 cents a share.
   Shares of Ethyl closed on the Big Board at $24.75, down 25
cents.
