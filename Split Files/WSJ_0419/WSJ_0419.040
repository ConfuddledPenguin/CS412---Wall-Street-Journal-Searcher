   American's Videos
   Don't Mean to Be Funny

   IF YOU WANT to be a video star, you don't have to record
an ear-splitting rock and roll tune. All you have to do is
drum up some gripes about American Airlines.
   As part of a test, the airline recently set up a video
booth in the baggage section of the Nashville airport to give
customers a chance to tape their comments. And judging from
some footage of the comments, obtained by this newspaper,
people don't seem to be the least bit shy about going on
camera.
   "We've just had the worst flight of our life," complains
one bearded traveler from Arizona, who describes how his
plane made two aborted landing attempts through fog in Dallas
before diverting to Austin to refuel, where he waited "hours
and hours." One elderly woman fights off tears as she
explains how a canceled American flight to Chattanooga is
forcing her and her ailing husband to rent a car and drive
three hours to get home.
   Another video guest says she has ordered special meals on
five flights and hasn't received one yet. Maybe she's lucky:
Another woman, named Patricia, complains that a special
seafood meal she ordered was so bad "even the stewardess said
`You shouldn't eat that. It smells terrible.'"
   The booth, designed by a company called Short Takes Inc.,
gives each passenger one minute. And for at least one weary
soul, that wasn't enough. Holding up a $25 award certificate
from American, he bitterly complains about having to go
through "an act of God" to redeem it and then takes a swipe
at the man in charge of American. "I don't like what Robert
Crandall is doing to our hub and if he were here right now,
I'd . . . ." (Oops, time's up.)
   Of course, not all the comments are so mean. One American
customer compliments the airline for serving bran muffins for
breakfast, but can't resist adding that "I think you could
lose the eggs and it wouldn't hurt our feelings bad at all."
One New York women provides a glowing account of how a
diligent American clerk hunted down a lost scarf. And an
Atlanta man gushes that American is "one of the greatest
businesses I have ever dealt with in any respect."
   American insists that despite some of the negative
feedback, it's pleased with the test so far. But it hasn't
decided whether to open more booths, which got mixed reviews
from customers. "This thing seems a little expensive to me,"
one patron says. "I would have been glad to do just a post
card."
                                                                                                       

   You Can Go Cheaply,
   But Do You Want to?
                                                                                                       

   IF ONLY Tallahassee, Fla., were some great mecca for
business travelers.
   Tallahassee turns out to be the cheapest city for business
travel, according to a survey of 100 cities by Corporate
Travel magazine. It costs the average business traveler just
$116 a day to spend a day and night there, including
overnight lodging, one-day car rental and three meals.
Biloxi, Miss., at $122 and Omaha, Neb., at $124 are the next
cheapest.
   But of course, most business people don't have reason to
go to these places. Here's the average cost for a one-day
business trip in the 10 most expensive cities: New York
($312); Chicago ($256); Boston ($252); Washington ($226);
Newark, N.J. ($218); San Francisco ($207); Los Angeles
($192); Dallas ($191); Baltimore ($186) and Detroit ($185).
                                                                                                       

   Running Into Confusion
   With Damage Waivers
                                                                                                       

   FOR MOST car renters, deciding whether to take the
collision-damage waiver has always been a bewildering choice.
Now, it may only get more confusing.
   Yesterday, Alamo Rent A Car Inc. announced it was offering
three types of waivers, instead of just one, in Florida
beginning this week. If it succeeds, the company plans to
expand the offer to other states, and analysts say at least
some competitors will have to match the policy, although they
haven't so far.
   The waiver is basically an agreement that a rental firm
won't charge the driver for any car damage in most cases.
Under Alamo's new plan, Florida drivers can buy the
traditional waiver for $9 a day for all car sizes. Or, they
can pay less and get less protection: For $6 a day, the
waiver covers the first $3,000 in damage; for $3 a day, it
covers the first $500.
   For savvy renters, the new options may be very attractive.
Many drivers' own insurance policies, for example, already
cover car rental damage, but come with $500 deductibles.
Those people, Alamo points out, can now buy the cheaper
waiver to cover the deductible without paying for any
unnecessary coverage.
   But renters who don't have this insurance -- or who aren't
clear about their coverage -- will now have only more hard
choices to make. And they still may not need any waiver if
they're using certain credit cards that provide free
car-rental insurance.
   "It was tough enough to explain their options when there
was only one level of coverage," says Fred Mudgett, a
car-rental industry consultant in Florida. "Now you've got
three levels to explain to people."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MORE THAN NINE out of 10 drivers think traffic congestion
worsened or didn't improve in 1989, according to a survey by
the American Automobile Association. Almost three out of 10
drove at least 10 miles out of their way to avoid the crowded
roads, the survey of 1,700 drivers found. . . . Consolidate
and conquer: Travel agencies with annual revenues of over $5
million controlled 33% of the market in 1987, up from 24% in
1983, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation study.
