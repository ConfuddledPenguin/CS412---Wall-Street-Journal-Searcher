   Loral Corp. is the target of a suit filed in U.S. court in
New York by a defense subcontractor that claims it lost
business as a result of allegedly illegal activities by Loral
in winning an Air Force contract.
   The suit, filed by Anaren Microwave Inc. of East Syracuse,
N.Y., seeks $36 million in damages from Loral and William M.
Galvin, a former consultant to Loral who pleaded guilty to
federal bribery charges last month in connection with the
Justice Department's "Ill Wind" investigation into Pentagon
procurement. Also named as defendants are Louis H. Oberndorf,
a Loral executive under suspension with pay, and Victor D.
Cohen, an Air Force procurement official.

   Loral, New York, pleaded guilty in December to conspiring
with Mr. Galvin to obtain the illicit assistance of Mr.
Cohen.
   A Loral spokeswoman said that, although the company hadn't
seen the suit, "we think it's utter nonsense."
   Anaren Microwave claims Loral unfairly won an Air Force
contract for radar warning gear for jet fighters in a
competition with Litton Industries Inc. in 1988. As a
supplier for Litton's system, Anaren Microwave said the
defendants' actions in effect robbed the subcontractor of
business.
