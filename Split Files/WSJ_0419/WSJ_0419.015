   Tokyo share prices surged yesterday afternoon to end
sharply higher, after the market's resistance to another
slide in the yen encouraged a broad range of investors to
buy.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which edged down
1.58 points Tuesday, was up 787.46 points, or more than 2.7%,
to close at 29249.06.

   By mid-morning Thursday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
surged 654.79 points to 29903.85.
   The Nikkei ended Wednesday morning's session with a
178-point gain, and the rally's pace increased later in the
afternoon, as sentiment improved further after the dollar
fell back from the high of 160.15 yen it reached in the
morning. Prices were also boosted by a drop in bond yields,
participants said.
   Futures-related program buying by arbitragers and several
rounds of index-linked buying by investment trust funds added
to the gains, traders said.
   Trading remained light. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 450 million shares, slightly up from 423 million
shares Tuesday. Winners outnumbered losers 699 to 234, while
163 issues remained unchanged. Lack of sell orders permitted
a small amount of buying to push up stock prices, observers
said.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 1.20 points Tuesday, was up 39.39
points to 2167.96.
   The second section index, which fell 11.03 points Tuesday,
gained 16.76 points to close at 3524.56. Volume in the second
section was estimated at eight million shares, up from seven
million shares Tuesday.
   The advances yesterday were led by interest rate-sensitive
large-capital issues, such as steel companies and
shipbuilders, which are usually sold when the yen weakens.
   The unusual gains made in these shares created speculation
that some trust banks and life insurance companies were
buying these stocks in exchange for pension-fund contracts of
steel and shipbuilding companies, traders said.
   Some analysts said such speculation could be true, but
added it would be more reasonable to see the gains as a
technical rise since such shares have been oversold in the
past month.
   Market attention was focused on the U.S. merchandise trade
report for February, scheduled for release yesterday, as a
sharp improvement of the U.S. trade deficit is likely to
strengthen the dollar against the yen.
   In the afternoon session, TDK rose strongly, climbing 460
yen to 6,840 yen ($42.75), as buying by one of the "big four"
brokerage houses encouraged other investors.
   TDK's gains also encouraged buying in other high-priced
high-technology shares, traders said. Sony was up 130 at
8,400, while Pioneer increased 120 to 6,070.
   All the major steel manufacturers rose stronglyl. Kobe
Steel gained 14 to 579 and NKK advanced 11 to 547.
   Among shipbuilders, Kawasaki Heavy Industries added 20 to
800. Hitachi Zosen rose 19 to 779 and Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries was up 18 to 953.
   Other big winners included Isuzu Motors, which gained 100
to 870, and Daiwa House, which ended at 2,150, up 130.
   In Frankfurt, share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
closed sharply lower in moderate activity as traders sold the
shares of engineering group Mannesmann and other companies
with investments in Brazil.
   The German Stock Index (DAX) dropped 24.59 points, or
1.3%, to 1889.76.
   Mannesmann, which has a large Brazilian subsidiary,
tumbled 17.50 marks ($10.45), or 4.5%, to 369 marks after a
British securities firm issued a sell recommendation because
the Brazilian government has frozen most liquid assets as
part of its economic restructuring program. Massive sales of
Mannesmann shares by British investors pulled the broader
market lower and kept it under pressure for the whole
session, traders said.
   Another stock that was dumped because of market's worries
about Brazil was auto maker Volkswagen, which is the junior
partner in the Brazilian-Argentine Autolatina joint venture
with Ford Motor Corp. Volkswagen dropped 10.90 marks to
579.20.
   Uncertainty about the timing and terms of monetary union
with East Germany and a lack of interest from foreign
investors is also keeping a lid on the market, traders said.
   Trading volume, which is still low as many participants
are away on Easter vacations, is likely to pick up again next
week, a trader at a large West German bank said.
   Traders said they were also disappointed that Deutsche
Bank fell below the psychological 800-mark level, dropping
9.50 marks to 791.50. Among other banking shares, Commerzbank
fell 1.50 mark to 286.50 marks.
   In the auto sector, Daimler-Benz slumped 8.50 marks to
912, and Bayerische Motoren Werke declined 11.50 marks to
574.50. Tire maker Continental gave up all of Tuesday's gain,
dropping 6.50 marks to 308.50.
   The Mannesmann sell-off pulled the whole steel and
machinery sector down, as Linde dropped 18 marks to 995, MAN
slumped nine marks to 497, Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD)
tumbled 11 marks to 272 and Hoesch plunged 12 marks to 324
marks.
   In London, share prices finished lower in a light,
trendless session as most investors pondered an array of
market forces. Shares were propelled higher initially by a
healthy rise in Tokyo. But participants soon began to lose
interest and awaited the outcome of U.S. trade figures. When
Wall Street refused to run with the good news, London
investors were bewildered. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index closed down 8.6 points at 2205.9. The
narrower 30-share index was down 3.7 points at 1732.6.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in
Amsterdam and Stockholm, lower in Paris, Zurich and Brussels.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in
Sydney, Hong Kong and Singapore, and were lower in Manila,
Taipei, Seoul and Wellington.
