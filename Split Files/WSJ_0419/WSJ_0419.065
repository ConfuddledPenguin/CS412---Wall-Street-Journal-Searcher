   DALLAS -- Investor Harold C. Simmons and NL Industries
Inc., recently rebuffed in a proxy fight with Lockheed Corp.,
sued the defense concern and its directors, challenging the
fairness and legality of the recent director elections.
   In the suit filed in Los Angeles federal court, NL alleged
that Lockheed's management and directors breached their
fiduciary duties and "manipulated the corporate machinery" by
placing millions of shares in friendly hands through an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan and then intimidated employees
into voting in management's favor.

   The Houston chemicals concern, which Mr. Simmons controls,
also alleges that Lockheed illegally solicited some shares by
distributing misleading proxy materials and that it threw out
other shares that should have been voted for NL.
   NL argues that if those votes were properly handled and
the ESOP votes were thrown out, its directors nominees would
have been elected. It asks the court to declare its slate the
winner or to call a new election in which the ESOP wouldn't
be permitted to vote.
   Backed by the ESOP, which owns about 18.9% of Lockheed's
stock, and several large institutions, Lockheed's director
nominees won between 58% and 61% of the votes at the March 29
annual meeting. NL, which owns 18.94% of Lockheed, got about
37% of the vote for its slate. At the same time, Lockheed
shareholders overwhelmingly approved shareholder initiatives
that NL had backed.
   In Calabasas, Calif., a Lockheed spokesman said the
company hasn't seen the suit and couldn't comment.
   In the lawsuit, NL contends that Lockheed's ESOP, which
was created about a year ago, allows employees to vote shares
well before they are allotted to their accounts or even paid
for. As a result, NL contends, Lockheed salaried employees
who own about 1% of the company can vote a block of more than
17% of the company, giving them about 15 votes for every
share of stock they own through the ESOP.
   NL also alleged that Lockheed unfairly pressured employees
to vote for management's slate by, among other things,
sending out solicitation materials through the credit union,
threatening punishment if NL materials were brought on
company property, requiring employees to wear pro-management
buttons and threatening employees who wore NL buttons with
dismissal.
   Further, the company charges that Lockheed further
"tainted" the election by moving up its usual annual meeting
date by almost six weeks -- giving NL only five business days
to nominate a slate -- and by distributing proxy materials
that implied that the election was uncontested.
