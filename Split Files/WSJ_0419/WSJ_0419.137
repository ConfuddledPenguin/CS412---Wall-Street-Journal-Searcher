   Central Power &amp; Light Co. to help financially strapped
customers took an unintended turn when the utility's
employees got involved.
   CPL serves southern Texas, an area with pockets of poverty
as severe as any found in the U.S. Late in 1988, as an
increasing number of the utility's customers began falling
behind on electricity bills, CPL came up with a deal: Let our
crews help make your home energy efficient -- and bring those
bills to a manageable level -- by caulking and
weatherstripping away drafts.
   Soon, and almost by accident, the program widened. CPL
meter readers suggested that some customers' homes needed
more than a window frame sealed. Other company employees took
up the challenge, offering to work on weekends, without pay,
to renovate homes in need.
   About 200 of CPL's 2,400 employees, ranging from clerks to
executives, now participate in the volunteer effort,
contributing their time while their employer and local
welfare agencies contribute construction materials.
   Employees in the program, dubbed "Reddy Neighbor," a play
on the electric-utility industry's Reddy Kilowatt logo, say
the satisfaction they get from helping their neighbors is
immense. Richard Earnest, CPL's southern region marketing
manager during the week and construction foreman on Saturdays
and Sundays, particularly recalls the work he and his fellow
employees performed for 80-year-old Eusebia Quiroz, a retired
field worker. Her four-room frame shanty was in such bad
shape that "at times we felt we had bitten off more than we
could chew," Mr. Earnest says. But after three weekends of
hammering and sawing by 50 CPL volunteers working under Mr.
Earnest's direction, the Quiroz home became a house, with a
new roof, new sheet-rock walls, new wiring, hot water and a
fresh coat of paint.
   All told, Mr. Earnest and his fellow volunteers repaired
12 homes last year, donating 3,000 hours of their time.
   Homeowners like the frail Miss Quiroz -- who spent her
working years picking okra, melons and other fruits and
vegetables -- are asked to sign waivers absolving the
volunteers and CPL from legal responsibility for the work
done. (Some of the volunteers are construction-trade workers
for CPL, but most work in other fields.)
   CPL, based in Corpus Christi and a subsidiary of Central &amp;
South West Corp. of Dallas, spent $12,000 last year on
materials and is careful to say that this nominal sum comes
from its "below the line" shareholder account. As a regulated
business, CPL wins rates based on the costs of providing
service, and not on the costs of improving customers' homes
or facilities.
   In return for this effort, CPL gains customer respect; it
also keeps customers. Robert Carey, CPL president and chief
executive officer, says that, among other things, the program
"gives us a chance to help some people who can use a hand."
But neither the utility nor its employees make a big deal of
it. Once a year, CPL throws a barbecue for its volunteer
workers and gives them a T-shirt bearing the program's "Reddy
Neighbor" logo.
