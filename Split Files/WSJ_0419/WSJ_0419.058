   VIETNAMESE REFUGEES

   The number of Vietnamese boat people arriving in Hong Kong
has fallen sharply, allowing hard-pressed officials to
concentrate on persuading those who are here to go home.
   So far this year 917 have arrived, against 2,441 for the
same period in 1989. Altogether last year, more than 34,000
boat people streamed into Hong Kong, which now has 54,000
Vietnamese packed into its camps. Most of 1989's influx was
from northern Vietnam, while this year's refugees are
predominantly southerners.
   "We have hard evidence that our message has got across in
northern Vietnam that there is no future here," says Mike
Hanson, Hong Kong government refugee coordinator. "It seems
people are coming from the south because it's cheaper and
safer there to come to Hong Kong."
   Hong Kong has recently suspended its controversial policy
of forcibly repatriating Vietnamese, and has attempted
instead to convince small groups of refugees to return
voluntarily to Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   BUILT IN AMERICA
                                                                                                       

   A study financed by the import auto industry predicts that
direct foreign investment in U.S. auto manufacturing will
create 110,000 jobs and lower the U.S.-Japan trade deficit by
$9.3 billion to $15.2 billion below what it otherwise would
be at the end of 1992. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department
projects that more than 1.5 million foreign cars will be made
at seven plants in the U.S. this year and 2.25 million
passenger cars will be imported. New-car sales are expected
to exceed 8.5 million.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN OUTPUT FALLS
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's industrial production dropped 4.7% in the
first quarter of 1990 from a year earlier. The nation's
Statistics Office attributed most of the fall to the exodus
of workers to West Germany. According to East German
officials, the total number of industrial laborers declined
by 124,000 over the last year.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN RETIREMENT PLAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party has approved a plan to
phase out aging legislators, who have been frozen in office
since 1949 when they followed the late Chiang Kai-shek into
exile after the Communist victory in mainland China. The
Nationalist Party resolution calls for the retirement of
these lawmakers by the end of 1991. Holding more than half
the seats in parliament, they have been the focus of heated
public protests in recent years because they have never stood
for re-election. Legislators in the fledgling opposition
Democratic Progressive Party have taken to yelling insults,
spitting and sometimes shoving elderly deputies to the floor
in order to prevent them from speaking during parliamentary
sessions.
                                                                                                       

   MAGNETIC SHIPS
                                                                                                       

   Japanese shipbuilders are taking a major stride toward
launching the world's first vessel powered by superconducting
magnets. The 100-foot-long hull of a test ship, the Yamato I,
will be moved next week from the western Japanese port of
Shimonoseki to Kobe, near Osaka, where engineers will attach
the magnetic propulsion system now under construction. "Our
goal is to test the propulsion system on the high seas next
year," says a spokesman for the Japan Foundation for
Shipbuilding Advancement. The system has many potential
advantages over propellers, including higher speed and
maneuverability, lower noise and running costs.
                                                                                                       

   PEPSI COMES TO BURMA
                                                                                                       

   PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi-Cola International has signed an
agreement to operate in Burma for the first time and hopes to
begin production by the end of the year. A company spokesman
says Pepsi would beat archrival Coca-Cola into the Burmese
market, which has been largely off-limits to Western
corporations for the past quarter century.
                                                                                                       

   ROMANIA'S FINEST?
                                                                                                       

   Romanian police, long regarded as the enforcers of
dictatorship, have launched a drive to become modern,
professional crime-fighters, and are appealing to Western
police forces to help train them.
   "We want to change the mentality of the policeman -- he
should be closer to the people and not terrorize them," says
Col. Vasile Dobrinoiu, who became head of the police training
academy after the fall and execution in December of dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Col. Dobrinoiu expressed the hope that Western countries
will send police instructors and donate modern teaching
materials to Romania.
   The police especially need training in non-violent crowd
control now that demonstrations, strictly banned under Mr.
Ceausescu, are becoming a feature of Romanian life.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A virus outbreak destroyed or damaged data in thousands of
computers throughout China last week, according to the
official New China News Agency. . . . Estonia has hired an
unnamed foreign firm to print bank notes that will replace
the ruble. If the new krone notes go into circulation as
scheduled on Dec. 24, Estonia will become the first
constituent Soviet republic to have its own currency.
