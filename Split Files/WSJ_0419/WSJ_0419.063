   The federal government is upgrading its probe into reports
of faulty brakes in more than one million full-sized cars
built by General Motors Corp.
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
said it has learned of almost 900 complaints of faulty brakes
on GM's so called "H-body" cars: the Buick LeSabre,
Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville. The agency's
investigation covers some 1,080,000 million cars built in the
1986 through 1988 model years.

   The government said it has received notice of 892
complaints about the braking systems, which were involved in
187 accidents. Seventy-four people reportedly were injured as
a result of these accidents.
   A spokesman for the agency said the problems appear to
have something to do with the brake master cylinder, but as
of this time, "we don't have the exact nature" of the
problem. He said the agency hasn't determined whether a
safety defect is the cause.
   The upgrade moves the probe from a preliminary
investigation status to the engineering analysis level.
   By moving the probe to a higher level, the government is
signaling it believes there could be a substantial problem
with the brakes on the cars. In addition, the government now
will dedicate a greater amount of resources to its
investigation.
   A GM spokesman said the auto maker is cooperating with the
agency's investigation, and wouldn't have any further
comment.
   Last August, the government stepped up a similar
investigation to determine whether 1,064,000 GM cars had a
potential rear-brake defect. That investigation involved all
of GM's 1986-1987 "C-body" and "H-body" cars, including the
Oldsmobile 98, the Cadillac DeVille and some models in the
current investigation. At the time, a federal safety official
said the agency had received 59 complaints, with one reported
accident and injury. The outcome of the prior investigation
wasn't immediately clear yesterday.
   Separately, the agency made an initial determination that
a safety-related defect exists in about 25,000 "micro-mini"
motor homes built between 1977 and 1986. It was the first
time the agency made an initial determination of a defect
since 1983.
   The motor homes are built on the back of mini-pickup truck
chassis built by Toyota Motor Co. Dozens of manufacturers
have done the conversion work on the vehicles covered by the
investigation. According to the agency, excessive weight has
been placed on the rear axles, resulting in axle failure and
the separation of wheels from the axle. The agency has
received 440 complaints about problems, including reports of
16 crashes involving injury.
   The agency will conduct a public meeting on May 23 about
the motor homes, before deciding whether to order the
manufacturers to recall the vehicles.
