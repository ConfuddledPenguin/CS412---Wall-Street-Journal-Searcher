   Two biotechnology teams announced they have successfully
inserted foreign genes into corn plants, a major goal of
agricultural biotechnology.
   DeKalb Genetics Corp., a commercial seed producer, and a
joint U.S. Department of Agriculture-Monsanto Co. team both
announced they had successfully produced fertile, genetically
altered corn plants capable of passing their new genes on to
succeeding generations.

   The feat opens the way to making corn, the nation's
biggest crop, resistant to disease, drought and herbicides,
as well as to increasing its nutritional value.
   A similar bioengineering claim was made in January by
BioTechnica International Inc. Unlike DeKalb and the
USDA-Monsanto team, however, BioTechnica has declined to say
what genes it inserted into corn plants and what technique it
used.
   Getting new genes into corn also has implications for
other key grain crops such as wheat and rice. Until now,
inserting new genes into plants has been successful only in a
class of plants known as "dicots," those that produce two
leaf-like growths called cotyledons when their seeds first
sprout. Tomatoes, tobacco and rapeseed are among the dicots
that have been successfully engineered genetically.
   Corn, as well as wheat, rice and other cereals, is among
the "monocots" that produce only a single cotyledon on
sprouting and that have defied attempts at genetic
engineering. While scientists have been able to get new genes
into monocot plants, the plants previously have ended up
sterile and unable to pass the new genes on in their seed.
   DeKalb said its scientists had used a "gene gun" to fire
microscopic pellets into test-tube cultured cells of the corn
plant. The pellets were coated with a gene that produces a
resistance to the herbicide bialaphos. Cells that
incorporated the new gene were identified by the fact that
they survived treatment with bialaphos. The genetically
altered cells were then grown into full-sized corn plants
that, in turn, produced seed resistant to the herbicide.
   The bialaphos-resistance gene was used only because it
served as a "marker," enabling the scientists to track the
gene. The gene is of little economic importance in the U.S.,
where bialaphos isn't used, though it's used in Europe,
according to Thomas Rice, a DeKalb scientist.
   The DeKalb research was carried out at laboratories in
Groton, Conn., leased from Pfizer Inc. Earlier this year,
DeKalb bought out Pfizer's 30% equity interest in what had
been a joint venture, DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics.
   The USDA-Monsanto announcement said USDA scientists at
laboratories in Albany, Calif., had used a similar "gene gun"
to fire new genes into corn-cell cultures developed at
Monsanto's laboratories in St. Louis. The scientists inserted
two "marker" genes into the corn cells: one gene that allowed
the cells to grow in the presence of an inhibitor; and a
second gene, taken from fireflies, that causes the cells
incorporating the gene to glow under a special low-light
detector.
   The cells that incorporated the two genes were grown to
mature plants that were then pollinated. The resulting seeds
were planted in a greenhouse where a crop of seedlings is now
growing. The light-detector has found that about half the
seedlings have the firefly gene.
   The feats are a major technological advance, but
scientists cautioned it may be several years before farmers
will have genetically altered seed to plant. Not only must
scientists get the right genes into corn, but they have to
make sure the genetic alteration doesn't affect the yield and
other valuable attributes of the plant. It will take several
seasons of field-testing to produce useful genetically
engineered hybrid corn seed, Mr. Rice cautioned.
