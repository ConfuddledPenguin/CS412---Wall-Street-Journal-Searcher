   Despite the day's fall, PaineWebber's head of OTC trading,
Richard Bruno, called the decline "an orderly sell-off in a
market that's reacting to inflation fears." He added: "I see
a broad buying interest in this market that I don't think
will be swept away by one down day."
   However, there aren't many buyers for shares of small- to
mid-sized companies, said Walter Carucci, president of Carr
Securities, a wholesale market maker whose customers are
brokers and dealers trading largely in stocks of that size.
   "There's a definite stratifying of the market," Mr.
Carucci said. "It's very reminiscent of the mid-1970s, where
well-known stocks performed magnificently and the rest of the
universe did badly." However, that lack of demand should make
those shares attractive in six months or so, Mr. Carucci
said. "I'm beginning to see some real values in terms of
inherit asset value and underlying fundamental value."
   MCI Communications, which reported first-quarter earnings,
dominated the day's trading, falling 1 5/8 to 35 1/8 on
nearly 6.5 million shares. Although the earnings were in line
with analysts' expectations, some investors expressed concern
about the long distance carrier's near-term outlook after
company officials held a morning conference call with
portfolio analysts.
   However, two analysts -- Jack Grubman of PaineWebber and
Joel D. Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette -- said they
were puzzled by investors' reaction to the conversation with
MCI's chief financial officer, Daniel F. Akerson. Both
analysts said they weren't surprised by his indications that
second quarter earnings will be 64 to 68 cents a share,
compared with 62 cents reported yesterday for the first
quarter.
   Mr. Grubman, who expects MCI's earnings to grow at about
20% a year over the next few years, said that some "go-go"
fund managers who invest in companies with very high growth
rates are scaling back their MCI positions. He suggests that
for the next few months, MCI's investor base will "be in
limbo" as it shifts to more traditional money managers
looking for large, high-quality companies with solid growth
rates from more aggressive funds looking for more rapid
growth.
   Stocks continued to trade on earnings and earnings
forecasts. "We're starting to see people buy on good news and
sell on bad news, like they did years ago before all the
takeover and arbitrage frenzy," said Jerry Markowitz, partner
in charge of OTC trading at Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco.
   Microsoft, which reported strong earnings late Tuesday,
fell 1 3/8 to 60 5/8 on profit-taking. Merrill Lynch analyst
Melinda H. Reach reduced her investment opinion on the
software maker to an "attractive" rating from the firm's top
"buy" rating, according to another person at Merrill.
   Also active was Apple Computer, unchanged at 43 1/4 on 1.7
million shares. After the close, the computer maker reported
second-quarter earnings rose to $1.04 a share from 44 cents a
year before. Mr. Bruno of PaineWebber said he expects to see
strong demand for Apple's shares this morning.
   Other technology issues up on encouraging earnings were
AST Research, up 2 to 23 1/4, Pyramid Technology, up 2 1/2 to
32 and Linear Technology, up 3/4 to 10 3/8.
   Bogert Oil spurted 2 3/8 to 12 1/8, a 24.7% gain, after
the Oklahoma City company announced it's in talks to be
acquired for $13.20 a share by a subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus
Energy Corp.
   Among the day's most active shares was a new issue,
Sullivan Dental Products, a marketer of dental supplies and
equipment based in West Allis, Wis. An initial public
offering of one million shares was priced at $10 each through
Dain Bosworth. More than 1.2 million shares traded, closing
up 2 7/8 at 12 7/8.
   Exide Electronics topped the day's percentage losers,
falling 2 1/2 to 8 1/4, or 23.26%, after a jury awarded about
$14.9 million in damages to a plaintiff charging the maker of
power supply products failed to pay certain sales
commissions. The Raleigh, N.C., company said it will appeal
the verdict.
   Neutrogena slid 2 5/8 to 19 1/2 after announcing late
Tuesday that it expects net income for the second quarter
ending April 30 will be about 50% lower than a year ago.
Attributing the drop to softness in the retail market, the
Los Angeles-based maker of personal care products said that
1990 growth will probably be flat with 1989.
