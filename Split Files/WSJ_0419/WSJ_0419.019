   FINDLAY, Ohio -- OHM Corp., an environmental services
concern, said it expects to post first-quarter net income of
five to seven cents a share, compared with a loss of 13 cents
a share a year earlier, on revenue of $47 million, an
indicated 43% rise from $32.8 million.
   The company attributed the better-than-expected results to
strength in its Remediation Services Group, including
increased revenue from industrial clients and federal and
state government contracts.
