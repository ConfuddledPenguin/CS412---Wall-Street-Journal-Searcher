   United Technologies Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose 8.7%
on a 7.6% revenue rise as the jet engine and elevator
divisions more than offset weakness in its automotive, air
conditioner, helicopter and defense electronics units.
   Net income climbed to $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share,
from $123.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. The
gain was in line with estimates by analysts who follow the
Hartford, Conn.-based concern. Revenue rose to $4.8 billion
in the latest quarter, from $4.46 billion a year earlier.

   The company said operating earnings for its Pratt &amp;
Whitney aircraft engine business soared 40% to $251 million
in the quarter, from $179 million a year earlier, primarily
because of higher spare parts sales and cost cuts. Pratt &amp;
Whitney's results also benefited from lower research and
development costs, which were inflated in the year-earlier
period by work on the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter
program.
   United Technologies said earnings for its Building Systems
segment rose 21% to $92 million in the quarter, from $76
million, largely because of international after-market sales
and service revenue at the Otis division, which makes
elevators and escalators. The Building Systems segment
includes the Carrier division, which posted lower earnings
because of weak demand for its heating, air conditioning and
ventilation equipment in North America, the company said.
   The company said its Flight Systems segment had an $11
million loss in the quarter, against a $12 million profit a
year ago, as sales of lower-valued parts and service reduced
earnings at the Sikorsky helicopter and Hamilton Standard
aerospace divisions. Losses at the Norden defense electronics
division continued in the quarter at year-earlier levels, a
spokesman said.
   Operating profit for the Industrial segment, which
includes the automotive products business, fell to $16
million from $53 million in the period due to reduced U.S.
car and truck production, the company said.
   "The corporation's diversity, large after-market
businesses and international presence continue to be its
greatest strengths, particularly when some segments of the
U.S. economy are soft," said Robert F. Daniell, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company said its backlog reached a record $21.2
billion at March 31, up from $18.2 billion a year earlier.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the shares closed at $57, down 37.5 cents.
