   DALLAS -- Clifford Gookin, an investment banker laid off
by First Boston Corp. in December, is moving to Texas to work
for Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., a unit of Inter-Regional
Financial Group.
   Mr. Gookin, who was the subject of a recent front-page
profile in The Wall Street Journal, was hired by First Boston
in Wall Street's 1980s boom. He was let go during an
industrywide retrenchment.
