   NEW YORK -- Program trading rose to 10.1% of New York
Stock Exchange volume, or 12.5 million shares a day, for the
week ended Sept. 14.
   In the previous week, program trading amounted to 9.8% of
daily volume, the Big Board said in its regular report on the
computer-aided trading strategies.

   Bear Stearns Cos. was the most active program-trading firm
for the latest week, trading 14.6 million shares in program
strategies; it also did more than one-third of all
stock-index arbitrage volume, mostly for its own account.
   Index arbitrage -- in which baskets of stocks are bought
and sold with offsetting trades in futures and options --
accounted for an unusually high 64.7% of program trading
volume. Arbitrage generally accounts for only about half of
overall program volume.
   Next to Bear Stearns, the next most-active firms were
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (11.5 million shares), General
Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit (10.4 million),
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (5.4 million) and PaineWebber Group Inc.
(5 million).
   "Buy" programs accounted for an average 2.6 million shares
daily and "sell" programs for 9.9 million, during a week in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.44 points, or
2.1%.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a basket of at
least 15, and often hundreds of stocks worth at least $1
million.
