   TORONTO -- John Labatt Ltd., a brewing and consumer
products concern, and Canada Packers Inc., a packaging and
food products concern, said they plan to combine their flour
milling operations and related businesses.
   The new partnership would have assets of about 310 million
Canadian dollars (US$268.3 million), the two companies said.
The Canada Packers operations had 1989 sales of C$430.7
million, and the Labatt businesses had sales of C$425.7
million in the year ended April 30.

   The plan calls for Labatt to put its Ogilvie Mills Ltd.
unit, which includes flour and oat milling, and starch,
bakery and pizza operations into the partnership. The Canada
Packers business units to be contributed include flour
milling operations, bakeries and retail franchise lines.
   Canada Packers would hold 60% and Labatt 40% of the
partnership, to be called Maple Leaf-Ogilvie, in which they
will invest about C$40 million to upgrade the capacity of
Montreal-area flour mills.
   The transaction, which the companies said they hope to
complete by year end, is subject to regulatory approval by
Canada's competition watchdog and foreign investment
regulators. Hillsdown PLC of Britain holds a 56% stake in
Canada Packers.
   The move is Labatt's latest step to decrease its exposure
to food and other consumer products. Last year, the company
sold its Catelli Inc. pasta and foods unit, fueling
speculation that the next asset for sale would be the Ogilvie
milling operations. A Labatt official said a partnership was
the best option to pursue, "due to Canada's loss of export
markets for flour and resulting inefficiencies for Canadian
millers." Canada's share of the world export market for flour
fell to 7% in 1989 from more than 30% in the years following
World War II.
