   NEW YORK -- Recession fears intensified in the financial
markets, and investors bought up Treasury securities and
dumped stocks, especially bank issues.
   The dollar closed narrowly mixed against key currencies.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 32.17 points lower
to 2427.48, the lowest close since May 1989. New York Stock
Exchange volume of 182,690,000 shares was the heaviest this
week.
   The stock market's decline sent some investors into
short-term Treasury securities, whose prices remained firm.
But long-term U.S. bonds jumped -- the 30-year Treasury bond
rose 1 point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount -- as some
traders decided the shock of sharply higher oil prices will
eventually deepen a recession that will bring about low
inflation and lower interest rates.
   Stocks swung widely, reflecting an equally volatile crude
oil market. Most stocks opened higher as traders anticipated
a decline in energy prices following President Bush's pledge
to draw oil from strategic reserves to cool the price
advance. Oil prices did drop at first, but rumors about a
Mideast shooting war caused prices to start climbing,
knocking stocks into a steep slide; the Dow Jones industrials
fell as many as 50 points. November crude oil futures closed
87 cents higher at $39.54 a barrel.
   Traders and investors were transfixed by the big declines
and heavy volume in stocks of many of the largest U.S. banks.
   Citicorp, for example, fell 3/4 to 13 3/4 with 4.2 million
shares changing hands, making it the most active issue on the
Big Board.
   Besides large New York bank issues, shares of regional
banks and insurance companies were hit, too. The selling
wasn't panicky, but traders said it reflected investors'
deepening pessimism about the U.S. financial sector.
   Institutional investors have been shedding financial
issues "for months, not days," said John Conlon, managing
director in charge of equity trading at Rothschild Inc. But
dividend cuts by Chase Manhattan last week and by Bank of
Boston yesterday have intensified investors' cynicism.
   "This market is taking down pretty stocks and ugly
stocks," said William Kufta, senior vice president at
Pitcairn Financial Management. "There is a meltdown of
confidence."
   Even stalwart "safe growth" stocks such as Becton
Dickinson were hit with selling pressure. Shares of the
medical supplies concern fell 1 3/4 to 65.
   Currency trading was thin as institutions began to close
their books for the third quarter, traders said.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks closed sharply lower. The Big Board's composite
index of all its listed shares fell 2.16 to 165.36, the
lowest close since March 1989. Only 395 issues gained on the
Big Board while 1,182 declined.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds finished sharply higher. The yield on the benchmark
30-year bond slid to 9.01%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.5612 marks and 138.00 yen compared
with 1.5650 marks and 136.84 yen Wednesday.
