   Harley-Davidson is often cited as an example of
"industrial policy that worked." Over the longer term,
however, the company is more likely to make it into textbooks
as a classic case study on the follies of protectionism.
   Your Aug. 31 story on Harley notes that the market for
smaller motorcycles has shrunk to a fraction of its former
self. But your writer ignores the significance of this fact.
Buyers of smaller bikes traditionally have honed their riding
skills on the less powerful machines, then "stepped up" to
ride Harleys. The motorcycle tariffs of the 1980s destroyed
this junior market. As a result, there is no younger
generation of bikers being weaned on Hondas. When
trend-conscious baby boomers eventually tire of Harleys, the
company may be hard pressed to find replacement customers.
