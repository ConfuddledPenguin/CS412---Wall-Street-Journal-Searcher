   PARIS -- Pechiney S.A. reported that first-half
consolidated profit, after payments to minority interests,
more than doubled to 3.94 billion francs ($752 million) from
1.75 billion francs a year earlier.
   But the state-controlled metals and packaging concern said
that, excluding one-time gains, earnings would have risen
only 6% to 1.25 billion francs from 1.18 billion francs. The
latest results included a gain of 2.69 billion francs from
the sale of Pechiney's headquarters in central Paris; a year
earlier, the company had a gain of 575 million francs from
the initial public offering of 25% of its Pechiney
International unit.

   On an operating level, first-half results were hurt by
lower aluminum prices and the franc's firm tone against the
dollar.
   Gross operating profit declined to 3.49 billion francs
from 4.82 billion francs, and profit from current operations
eased to 2.12 billion francs from 2.99 billion francs.
   Consolidated revenue fell 11% to 40.1 billion francs from
44.69 billion francs.
