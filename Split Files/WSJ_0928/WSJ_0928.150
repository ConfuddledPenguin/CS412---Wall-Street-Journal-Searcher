   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank said it gave
final approval to a $178.6 million direct loan and a
guarantee covering $8.5 million in other financing for
Brazil's purchase of two telecommunications satellites from
Hughes Aircraft Co., the Los Angeles-based unit of General
Motors Corp.
   The Ex-Im Bank said the equipment will cost about $210
million and that the two satellites, to be launched in 1994,
will replace satellites launched in 1985 and 1986.

   The Ex-Im Bank loan and credit guarantee, to cover certain
"local costs" in Brazil, will be provided to Embratel, a
Brazilian government-owned telecommunications company.
Embratel is a subsidiary of Telebras, which is responsible
for all of Brazil's domestic, long-distance and international
telecommunications facilities.
