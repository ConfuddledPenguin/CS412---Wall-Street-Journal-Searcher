   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Citizens Utilities Co. and Louisiana
General Services Inc. said they have amended their pending
merger agreement.
   The amended agreement would change the share exchange
ratio in the stock swap merger so that Louisiana General
shareholders would receive from 0.6719 to 0.8 share of
Citizens Utilities common Series B for each Louisiana General
common share held.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The exchange was originally set at 0.6719 share. The
actual figure will depend on the average share price of
Citizens shares during a period prior to the merger.
   The amendment to the merger agreement is subject to
approval by the shareholders of both companies. Citizens is a
public utility, providing telecommunications, electric, gas
and water services in 12 states. Louisiana General is
primarily involved in residential and commercial gas
operations and industrial gas operations in Louisiana.
