   Van Dorn Co., Cleveland, said it reached agreement with
its chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence C. Jones,
to settle claims against him in a shareholder derivative
action.
   Van Dorn said the agreement provides for the company to
petition the court to dismiss all claims against Mr. Jones.
In exchange, Mr. Jones agreed to make undisclosed payments in
settlement of disputed claims, dating back to the 1960s.

   The agreement was approved by the company's board
following a recommendation by its special litigation
committee.
   Company officials weren't available for further comment.
   The lawsuit was filed last year by Vincent Coleman, former
president of Van Dorn Heat Treating Co. The suit alleges that
Mr. Jones engaged for decades in "fraudulent and deceptive
acts" including the use of Van Dorn credit and funds for
personal business such as landscaping and maintaining
personal real estate.
   Van Dorn makes containers and plastic molding machinery.
