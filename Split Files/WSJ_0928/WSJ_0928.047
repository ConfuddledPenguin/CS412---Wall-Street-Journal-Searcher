   PARIS -- Cie. Financiere de Paribas said consolidated
profit jumped 30% in the first half of 1990, largely on the
strength of capital gains on its portfolio of securities and
real estate.
   The French bank and financial holding company said
consolidated profit after payments to minority interests rose
to 2.49 billion francs ($474.7 million), or 39.10 francs a
share, from 1.91 billion francs ($364.5 million), or 35.50
francs a share, in the first half of 1989.

   Paribas said the rise was led by capital gains and
dividends from minority-held industrial affiliates. A company
official said much of the increase came from the sale of an
office building in Paris for a pretax capital gain of 1.3
billion francs.
   On the other hand, income from traditional banking
operations and dividends from financial units fell to 168
million francs from 1.04 billion francs a year earlier.
Paribas said one reason was heavy spending on new portfolio
investment, profit from which was recorded as securities
income. It didn't give details of the new investment,
although an official suggested that much of it came in a 2.7
billion franc outlay for 54% of the French food group
Guyomarch S.A. in February.
   The group's main bank units, Banque Paribas, Credit du
Nord and Cie. Bancaire, generated profit of 1.06 billion
francs, up 15%. The rise included the 1.3 billion franc
pretax capital gain on the Paris real estate sale, which was
made by Banque Paribas. The company said Credit du Nord and
Cie. Bancaire posted small profit gains but didn't disclose
details.
   Otherwise, it said profitability in the banking sector was
held back by rising interest rates and efforts to boost
provisions for loan risks. Paribas said new provisions for
the first half totaled 2.3 billion francs, compared with 1.8
billion in the first half of 1989. It didn't make any new
provisions for its sovereign, or government, debt exposure,
which is covered by insurance it took out last year.
   Profit from Paribas's non-banking units, mostly in the
portfolio sector, rose 43% in the first half to 1.43 billion
francs.
