   LONDON -- Berisford International PLC, a troubled U.K.
food, financial services, property, commodities and
industrial group, said it concluded a #1.2 billion ($2.2
billion) refinancing package with about 70 banks.
   The package covers all of Berisford's bank debt, said the
company, except for its coffee business, which is subject to
separate negotiations scheduled for completion in the "near
future."

   The group said the new arrangements will help it carry out
an orderly disposal program and restructuring of the
business. It said the sale of its major division, British
Sugar, is "well under way."
   In July, Berisford Chairman John Sclater said the company
was willing to sell any part of the business to reduce its
debt. In its latest six-month results to March 31, Berisford
reported net borrowings of #1.02 billion.
