   KUWAIT'S EMIR ADDRESSED the U.N., decrying "terror"
inflicted by Iraq.
   Sheik Jaber's appeal for a withdrawal of Baghdad's troops
drew a standing ovation as Iraq tightened its grip on the
emirate by ordering Kuwaiti nationals to apply for Iraqi
citizenship. Western governments, meanwhile, expressed
outrage at an Iraqi threat to execute diplomats who shelter
foreigners, but Baghdad said the warning was aimed at its own
citizens. In the Red Sea, a U.S. Navy frigate fired shots
across the bow of an Iraqi tanker. The tanker was released
after the Navy searched the vessel. Despite a U.N. air
embargo against Baghdad, three Iraqi Airways flights arrived
in Jordan.
