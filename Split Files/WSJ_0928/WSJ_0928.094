   OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney named
eight additional government supporters to the Senate to try
to push through the government's proposed value-added tax.
   The move increased the size of the Senate to 112 seats
from 104 seats. It was the first time in Canadian history
that a prime minister has taken such action.

   The highly unpopular tax bill has encountered stormy
resistance from the Liberal Party opposition in the appointed
chamber.
   The appointments give the ruling Progressive Conservatives
54 seats in the Senate. The Liberals have 52 seats. The
Conservatives will need the support of independent senators
to get the tax bill passed. The 7% tax is to take effect Jan.
1 if it is approved by the Senate.
   The appointments required the approval of Britain's
monarch who is Canada's titular head of state. Mr. Mulroney
said the queen authorized the appointments.
   Mr. Mulroney's action doesn't assure the passage of the
proposed value-added tax. The Liberal leadership in the
Senate said it will use various parliamentary tactics to
delay a vote on the tax.
