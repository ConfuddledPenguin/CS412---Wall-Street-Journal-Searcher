   Unisys Corp. said its board voted to omit the quarterly
dividend of 25 cents a share on common stock, sending the
already depressed stock tumbling a further 23%.
   In an interview, James Unruh, chief executive officer of
the computer and defense-electronics concern, also backed
away from assurances earlier this year that Unisys would be
profitable for the full year.

   Unisys, whose prospects have been deteriorating for almost
two years, indicated it decided to omit the dividend partly
because of the worsening outlook for the world economy. In
addition, Mr. Unruh said that business had weakened this
quarter in Europe, which had been a mainstay for the company
as it tried to deal with sluggishness in the U.S. Early signs
of problems in Europe, disclosed in the second-quarter
earnings report, had sparked the latest round of concern
among investors about Unisys.
   Unisys, Blue Bell, Pa., said it continued to make its
promised progress in tackling its biggest problem: the hefty
debt load. The company reduced debt by $325 million in the
first half, from around $4 billion, or 50% of its total stock
and debt, and Unisys said it should meet its target of a $600
million to $800 million reduction over the full year. Unisys
added that it expects to cut debt by at least that much in
1991.
   But Mr. Unruh said he thought it was prudent to omit the
dividend, saving Unisys nearly $160 million a year. He said
he thought the move would maximize shareholder value --
although it certainly didn't in the short term, as the stock
tumbled $1.625 to $5.375 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. That drop means that Unisys, with $10 billion
in annual sales, carries a market value of $800 million. The
stock has been as high as $17.125 as recently as March.
   The Unisys statement also confirmed securities analysts'
predictions that the company will report a loss for the third
quarter. Analysts generally expect a loss of 10 cents to 35
cents a share. That compares with the year-earlier loss of
$648.2 million, or $4.25 a share, which included a $230
million special charge related to plant closings and
extensive job cuts.
   Unisys reiterated that it expects to be profitable in the
fourth quarter. The company -- which some analysts had said
as recently as June should earn $2 a share this year -- may
still show a profit for the full year, Mr. Unruh said. But
that will require a strong fourth quarter; in the first half
the company earned just $8.6 million, which translated into a
loss of 28 cents a share because of heavy preferred-dividend
requirements. And Mr. Unruh said that "it's becoming more
hazardous to predict, given the rapidly changing economic
environment."
   While the company has continued to make progress in
cutting inventories -- which were last year's biggest problem
-- it has lost the momentum it got from the replacement last
year of aging mainframe and minicomputer lines. In addition,
competition in the computer industry has remained cutthroat.
That is especially true for systems that use the Unix
operating system, an area that Unisys has decided must
constitute its future.
   Unisys is expected to announce on Monday a broad software
strategy to tie together the different types of hardware and
software it sells, making it easier for all its computers to
talk to each other. The strategy will focus, in particular,
on customers, such as banks and airlines, that need to
process many transactions rapidly. Mr. Unruh, while declining
to provide details, said: "We think this is very
significant." But most of the company's big competitors have
already announced similar plans. In any case, the strategy
won't help in the short term, because such conceptual moves
tend to unfold over several years.
