   Consolidated pretax profit at Fiat S.p.A. fell almost 13%
in the first half, reflecting increased competition in its
home market and weakening demand for new cars in Europe
generally.
   The Italian car maker forecast a tough second half, saying
the Gulf crisis, higher inflation and the country's
continuing budgetary problems were likely to hurt business.

   Consolidated pretax profit fell to 2.45 trillion lire
($2.09 billion) in the first half from 2.81 trillion lire in
the same period of 1989, while consolidated net revenue rose
to 30.31 trillion lire from 27.11 trillion.
   Fiat's market share in Italy fell to 54% in the first six
months from 58% a year earlier. Fiat has encountered strong
competition on its own turf from Ford Motor Co., which has
doubled its market share in Italy to 7% this year following a
strong marketing campaign for its new-style Fiesta model,
which competes head-on with Fiat's top-selling Uno.
   In the wider European market, Fiat's sales rose to
1,080,000 vehicles in the first half from 1,040,000 vehicles
a year earlier, but its market share slipped to 15% from
15.5%.
   Another factor in the fall in the group's profitability
was heavy losses by Fiat's Brazilian subsidiaries, totaling
more than 300 billion lire.
