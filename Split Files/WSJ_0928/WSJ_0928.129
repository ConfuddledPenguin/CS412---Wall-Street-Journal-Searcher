   Marriott Corp. said net income for the third quarter was
$27 million, or 27 cents a share, down 57% from $63 million,
or 56 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Year-ago
results included airline catering and discontinued restaurant
operations.
   The lodging and food services company, based in Bethesda,
Md., reported sales of $1.66 billion, down 2.2% from $1.7
billion in the 1989 third quarter.

   Marriott said per-share earnings from continuing
operations fell sharply to 27 cents from 46 cents a year ago.
   It attributed much of the decline to events in the Middle
East, which have damped business travel. Marriott said
pershare earnings from continuing operations actually rose
9%, excluding the impact of several non-comparable items.
   J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president, said sales for
ongoing lodging and contract-services operations were above
1989 levels.
