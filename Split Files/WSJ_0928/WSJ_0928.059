   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government proposed to allow
Canadian financial institutions greater scope for
diversification, raising the prospect of a new round of
acquisitions in the financial industry.
   At the same time, the government, mindful of the U.S.
savings and loan company failures, said it will tighten its
supervision of banks and other financial concerns.

   The government's plan would permit banks to own insurance
companies and trust companies, which are similar to U.S.
savings and loan companies. Trust companies and insurance
companies are to be allowed to own each other.
   Trust companies also are to be given full powers to lend
to business and consumers, allowing them to compete more
aggressively with banks. John Evans, president of the Trust
Companies Association, said the trust industry was "very
pleased" with the government plan.
   He said the tighter supervisory powers would guard against
any further failures of financial institutions, such as
occurred in the early 1980s when several small trust
companies collapsed. The new rules impose further
requirements on financial institutions to furnish federal
regulators with information on their financial health.
   The government's proposals require parliamentary approval.
Legislation to implement the proposed trust company changes
was introduced yesterday and legislation on banks and
insurance companies will be introduced later. All the new
laws are to take effect on the same date.
   The government proposed that at least 35% of the shares of
a large trust or insurance company be widely held within five
years. This requirement would apply to companies with at
least 750 million Canadian dollars (US$650 million) of
capital. The only trust company believed to be immediately
affected by the decision is Canada Trust, 98% owned by Imasco
Ltd., a Montreal-based holding company.
   An Imasco spokesman said the company was prepared to
comply with a 65% ownership ceiling in Canada Trust, provided
that the new legislation strengthens, as it appears to do,
the trust company's competitive position in the lending
business.
   Canada's major banks had urged the government to limit to
10% the trust company shareholding of any group or
individual. This would be the same rigorous ownership rule
that applies to banks. But the government decided that
federal trust and insurance companies could retain the right
to be closely held.
   Helen Sinclair, president of the Canadian Bankers'
Association, said she hoped the differences on the trust
company ownership issue "will receive full and thoughtful
scrutiny during the upcoming public debate" on the
government's plan.
   The government's proposals would allow the completion of
some proposed transactions, including Royal Bank of Canada's
planned purchase of International Trust Co. of Toronto. The
transaction was conditional on a lifting of the prohibition
of bank ownership of trust companies.
   Canadian banks are expected to move quickly to take
advantange of the new investment opportunities once the new
legislation is passed by Parliament. Five of Canada's six
major banks purchased securities companies after restrictions
on the ownership of securities firms were lifted in 1987.
   The government said restrictions on foreign ownership of
Canadian banks will be relaxed to permit entry into Canadian
banking of such institutions as insurance companies and
securities dealers.
