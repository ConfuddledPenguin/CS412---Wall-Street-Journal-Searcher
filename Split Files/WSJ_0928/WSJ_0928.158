   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Principals of MCA Inc. and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. plan to meet late next
week to begin negotiating the possible $7.3 billion to $8.7
billion acquisition of the U.S. entertainment company, people
close to the situation say.
   The two sides haven't had formal talks before, and
accounts vary on how much work awaits them. Sources on the
Matsushita side stress that talks to date have been
preliminary; sources in the MCA camp say the parameters have
already been established by go-between Michael Ovitz,
chairman of Creative Artists, a talent agency, who is
representing Matsushita.

   Separately, it was learned that MCA Music Entertainment
Group has agreed to form a joint venture with Victor Co. of
Japan Ltd., 51%-owned by Matsushita, to market and distribute
all MCA records as well as its Geffen and GRP labels in
Japan. Al Teller, chairman of MCA Music, wouldn't comment,
but he is said to have been working on the deal -- and
another distribution agreement with West German media concern
Bertelsmann AG -- months before initial discussions began
between MCA and Matsushita.
   In the MCA-Matsushita talks, which may begin as late as
next Sunday, numerous issues have yet to be worked out.
According to sources close to MCA, the basic terms of the
arrangement -- that management will remain in place and that
the price will be from $80-$95 a share for all of the
approximately 91.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding
-- have been worked out. But advisers at the Japanese
consumer electronics concern are expected to recommend a
lower price, closer to $60 to $70 a share.
   Likely participants in the talks will be representatives
from the two companies, plus, for Matsushita: Mr. Ovitz;
Herbert Allen of the investment advisory firm of Allen & Co.;
the law firm of Simpson, Thacher &amp; Bartlett; and a major
investment bank -- possibly Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. -- which is
being retained.
   MCA will be represented by Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres
& Co.; Martin Lipton of the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz; and Robert Strauss of the Washington law firm
of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld. Mr. Strauss and Mr.
Rohatyn are MCA directors, and Mr. Strauss is said to have
played a key role in preliminary talks.
   None of the advisers would comment on the talks. Mr. Allen
and Mr. Ovitz worked together on last year's Sony Corp.
acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Mr. Ovitz had
negotiated with Sony to head Columbia, but talks broke down.
Hollywood speculates that Mr. Ovitz wants a role in MCA, but
people close to MCA and Creative Artists deny any immediate
plan for him to run the company.
   One key issue of the negotiations is said to be
tax-related. MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, 77 years old, and
the estate of the company's late founder Jules Stein, along
with various charitable trusts which Mr. Wasserman controls,
hold about 12% of MCA stock at an extremely low cost basis.
Capital gains and estate taxes could be extensive if the
acquisition takes place.
   Individuals close to the situation say negotiators would
seek an arrangement under which this tax bite could be
deferred, perhaps through some non-cash component or other
mechanism -- such as a premium or specially -- created
security. The remaining shareholders would be paid in cash.
This could complicate the acquisition structure, but tax
experts say a solution probably could be found.
   The meeting was originally planned for this weekend. But
the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, and the fact that a key
Matsushita player reportedly would have had to return to
Japan by Wednesday, postponed the plan. In addition,
"Everybody just needed more time to get all the numbers
together," one source said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday MCA
stock closed at $59 a share, down $2.25 a share, buffeted by
conflicting reports of the meeting schedule.
   The MCA-Victor Co. music pact is designed to solve a
strategic weakness for MCA: It lacks international
distribution for its music outside the U.S., Canada and the
U.K. Instead, it contracts with a unit of Time Warner Inc.
for distribution. MCA wants its own piece of this growing $20
billion business and wants to develop its own roster of
overseas artists.
   MCA and Geffen's agreements with Time Warner expire in
April and January, respectively. Mr. Teller wouldn't comment
on either agreement, but it's known that since MCA acquired
Geffen Records for 10 million shares of MCA stock in March,
Mr. Teller has been pursuing new distribution agreements. A
Victor Co. spokesman was unavailable for comment.
   Separately, shareholder suits seeking class action status
have been filed in Delaware Chancery Court and in Los Angeles
Superior Court, charging MCA with denying shareholders the
chance to get a higher price for their shares by spurning
other suitors, negotiating preferentially with Matsushita,
seeking to preserve MCA management and entering talks when
the shares were trading at the comparatively low price of
$34. MCA didn't comment on the suits.
