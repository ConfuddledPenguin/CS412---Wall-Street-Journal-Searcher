   CHICAGO -- The commercial printing industry, plagued by
overcapacity, is currently "very weak, fragile, and very
vulnerable," R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Chairman John R.
Walter said.
   But the nation's largest commercial printer, protected to
an extent by its diversity, technical acumen and sheer size,
sees "significant opportunities" ahead, Mr. Walter added.

   "All of our core businesses are growing," despite the
pinch of what appears to be "the roughest year in the
magazine industry in 25 years," Mr. Walter said.
   In an interview, the 43-year-old executive outlined his
efforts to boost Donnelley's international posture, and
talked about the once-staid concern's more aggressive
acquisition policy. Donnelly recently closed its biggest-ever
purchase, the $487.5 million acquisition of a printing joint
venture between Meredith Corp. and West Germany's Burda
family.
   Donnelley is bigger than its next three or four largest
competitors combined and historically has spent heavily on
technology. Those outlays, which initially drew criticism
from analysts who wanted to see the funds go to the company's
bottom line, are now paying off, Mr. Walter said.
   The industry has seen "more technological change in the
past five years than in the previous 50," he says. Those
changes "bode well for the industry" overall, but pose a
threat to those companies that are too small or financially
strapped to adopt the changes.
   Donnelley's size (1989 revenue of $3.12 billion) and its
solid balance sheet thus "can give an advantage" by
permitting the costly pursuit of technical enhancements, he
said.
   Mr. Walter is an unabashed booster of what he sees as
print's bright future as a medium, even in an era of
broadcast and computer-accessible information. "Successful
printing companies in the '90s won't simply put ink on paper.
. . . It's not a race to run printing presses faster," he
said. "We're in the business of delivering information. Our
real competition isn't other printers, but other media."
   Donnelley prints hard and softbound books, numerous
national magazines, catalogs and phone directories. In recent
years, it has also grown into the second-largest financial
printer in the U.S., and managed a profit, although the 1987
market crash turned that specialized market into a quagmire
for most other players.
   The softness in advertising that has badly hurt magazines
hurts Donnelley, too, Mr. Walter said. "That's a very strong
franchise for us, 17% to 18% of our revenue." But although "I
don't see {the current downturn} getting any better in the
next nine months," he remains "very optimistic" about the
magazine industry's future.
   Donnelley's technical push has produced its "Selectronic"
technology, which allows high-speed insertion of personalized
advertising or editorial content in catalogs or magazines.
The content can be targeted by demographic information culled
from Donnelley's extensive mailing-list database, or combined
with customer-supplied information.
   Donnelley is also fine-tuning a "print-on-demand"
technique that will permit textbook customers, such as
university professors, to customize book content.
   The moves are part of Mr. Walter's efforts to make
Donnelley more responsive to its customers' needs. By
decentralizing operations and trimming its work force, Mr.
Walter says Donnelly has "worked hard to change from a
manufacturing concern to a customer-service company."
   Donnelley is also pushing to achieve a more global
posture. Last year, it acquired an Irish printer to increase
its presence in Western Europe, and is currently building a
plant in Singapore. Donnelley is also constructing a plant in
Reynoso, Mexico, that will move it into the field of
professional and juvenile-book production, now dominated by
low-cost Asian printers.
   Donnelley's agreement to buy the Meredith-Burda joint
venture was announced late last year but had been stalled by
antitrust regulators' unsuccessful efforts to block the deal.
While analysts have interpreted the acquisition as signifying
a more aggressive acquisition posture for Donnelley under Mr.
Walter's leadership, the exescutive plays down the
significance of the acquisition in that respect.
   "In the first 115 years of this company's history," he
said, "we carried out one acquisition. But we've done 14 or
15 in the past 10 years." Donnelley sees "very good
opportunities for acquisitions" in the distressed industry,
Mr. Walter said. "We'll grow by buying or investing in new
assets," he said.
