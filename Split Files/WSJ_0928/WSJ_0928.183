   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is raising prices on some
1990 and 1991 models by cutting the cash discounts offered to
buyers.
   In effect, the No. 1 auto maker is joining Ford Motor Co.
in a gamble that efforts to boost revenue in a slumping
market won't cost market share in the competition against
Japanese auto makers.

   GM didn't raise prices as much as Ford, which earlier this
week eliminated cash-to-customer rebates on leftover 1990
models and sharply scaled back the discounts on many
high-volume 1991 models. Unlike Ford, GM left cash discounts
on most 1990 models. However, rebates on some high-volume
1990 and 1991 Chevrolet models will be substantially less
than they were just a few days ago.
   For example, someone who bought a 1990 Chevrolet Corsica
Monday got a $1,000 cash rebate. But buying a 1990 Corsica
today will mean only $500 off the sticker price, in effect a
$500 price boost.
   GM is raising the prices on 1991 Corsicas, too, by cutting
the cash rebate to $500 from $750. Similarly, the rebate on
1990 Chevrolet Lumina mid-sized sedans was cut to $500 from
as much as $1,500.
   "Certainly we watch what other people do," a Chevrolet
spokesman said. The decision to cut back on rebates in part
reflects lower stocks of unsold cars on GM dealer lots, he
said.
   GM isn't raising prices on every model. Some weak-selling
models will come with even bigger discounts. The rebate on
certain 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Coupes rose to $2,500
from $2,000. The discount on other Cutlass Supremes will
remain at $2,000.
   GM's bid to raise prices on high-volume lines reflects
growing pessimism about the strength of the U.S. auto market.
GM and Ford, by raising prices, are signaling that they're
resigned to a period of weak sales.
