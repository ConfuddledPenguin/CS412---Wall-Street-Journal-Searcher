   Colonial Realty Corp., the embattled West Hartford, Conn.,
real estate syndicator, got a reprieve yesterday when a
petition for involuntary bankruptcy-court liquidation of the
company was converted into a Chapter 11 reorganization.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Krechevsky approved a
request by Colonial's lawyers to convert the Chapter 7
petition, which was filed on Sept. 14 by six banks. The
banks, including a unit of Bank of New England Corp. and
People's Bank of Bridgeport, did not oppose the conversion.

   Colonial, which is closely held, has marketed limited
partnerships on real estate once valued at more than $1
billion.
   "Obviously, this is in the best interests of the investors
and of the company," said Colonial spokesman Tom Drohan.
   John Nolan, a Hartford lawyer who represents one of the
banks, said that a creditors commitee had been formed, which
would seek court approval to hire Coopers &amp; Lybrand to
examine the company's books.
