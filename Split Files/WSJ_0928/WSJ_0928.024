   GREENWICH, Conn. -- UST Inc., a leading U.S. marketer of
smokeless tobacco, said it made several changes in its top
management, as part of its succession plan.
   Vincent A. Gierer Jr., formerly executive vice president
and chief financial officer, was named president and chief
operating officer. As president, the 42-year-old Mr. Gierer
succeeds Louis F. Bantle, chairman and chief executive
officer, who had assumed the additional post after Nicolas A.
Buoniconti resigned as president and chief operating officer
last December. Mr. Bantle, 61, had left the operating chief's
post vacant.

   Jack Africk, 61, formerly executive vice president and
president of UST's U.S. Tobacco Co. unit, was elected a vice
chairman of the parent. He will oversee legal and government
relations and a new corporate development department.
   Succeeding Mr. Africk as U.S. Tobacco president is Joseph
R. Taddeo, who was senior vice president of the unit. Mr.
Taddeo also was elected a UST director, increasing board
membership to nine.
   UST said much of Mr. Gierer's former responsibilities as
chief financial officer will be assumed by John J.
Bucchignano, who was named principal financial officer and
senior vice president, and will remain principal accounting
officer and controller.
   UST produces smokeless tobacco sold under brand names such
as Copenhagen and Skoal. It also markets wines and makes
tobacco-related products, such as pipes and pipe tobacco.
