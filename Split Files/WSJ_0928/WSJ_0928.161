   If the budget summit is settling on indexation of the base
for capital gains, it's also time to look seriously at
deductibility of capital losses. For starters, here are some
reasons:
   Equity. While the system adds gains to ordinary income and
taxes it all, it allows the deduction from ordinary income of

   Economic vitality. Indexing of its nature affects
filed-away investments. Loss deductibility of its nature
would occur quickly most of the time, freeing capital to move
on to better uses. It would help high-risk, high-reward
investments. Don't ask "the rich" about that; ask an
electronics or biotech entrepreneur.
   Whether George Mitchell likes it or not, investments have
something to do with America's health. Some go up, some down.
A budget summit that both indexed gains and allowed
deductibility of losses would reassure the country that
Washington still wants it to grow.
