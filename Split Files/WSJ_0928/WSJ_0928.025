   FORT WORTH, Texas -- The Union Pacific Resources Co. unit
of Union Pacific Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., said it agreed with
Oryx Energy Co. of Dallas to purchase producing properties in
two fields for about $109 million.
   In one property, the Carthage Field in east Texas, the
unit will acquire leases covering 31,500 acres. The other
property, about 4,500 acres, is the Echo Springs Field in
southern Wyoming. The two fields combined will increase Union
Pacific Resources' net production of natural gas by more than
20 million cubic feet daily.
