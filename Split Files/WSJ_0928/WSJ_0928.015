   LOS ANGELES -- Frank E. Baxter, the 53-year-old president
and chief executive officer of Jefferies Group Inc., was
elected to the additional post of chairman.
   The post had been vacant since March 1987 when founder
Boyd L. Jefferies resigned before pleading guilty to two
federal counts of violating federal securities laws. He later
received a suspended sentence and was fined $250,000.
Jefferies is a securities firm primarily engaged in
securities trading.
