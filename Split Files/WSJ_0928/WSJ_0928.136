   Union Carbide Corp., hoping to check the steady erosion of
its stock price, announced a plan to buy back as much as 14%
of its shares, reduce debt and reap roughly $300 million from
certain asset sales.
   Although this year the Danbury, Conn., company decided
against a radical restructuring, it left open the possibility
of the kind of moves it disclosed yesterday as it sought to
regain investors' confidence. The company, whose emphasis on
petrochemicals makes it vulnerable to rising oil prices, also
took pains to say its quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share
is solid.

   "What we're trying to do is send a message to investors
and potential investors that we are as concerned about our
share price as they are -- more so, I hope -- and intend to
do something about it," Robert D. Kennedy, Carbide's chairman
and chief executive officer, said in an interview. He added,
"The trading value of our shares is ludicrous."
   The announcement bolstered Carbide shares in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the overall market
continued to falter. Carbide rose 62.5 cents to close at
$14.875. The previous day's closing price had been a new
52-week low, down by more than half from the 52-week high of
$28.625.
   "We're encouraged to see management do some of the things
we thought they might do when we bought" the stock in the
first place, said James R. Ullman, a trustee at Batterymarch
Financial Management. He said the investment concern
currently holds 910,000 Carbide shares.
   But the details of the plan confirm that Carbide will
stick with its core businesses in chemicals and industrial
gases. One of the planned asset sales would shed 50% of the
company's carbon products business, but that accounted for
only 8.3% of Carbide's sales in the first half of 1990.
   "What it looks like is that the board is united behind
what are really very minor moves," said Paul C.
Christopherson, a chemicals industry analyst at Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co.
   The battering of Carbide's shares partly reflects
uncertainties about how the company will fare as it heads
into what may be a recession and a period of sustained higher
oil prices. Additional industrywide production capacity will
make it more difficult for petrochemical makers to recover
their higher oil-related raw material costs through higher
prices to their customers.
   But Mr. Kennedy insisted that Carbide will benefit over
the long haul by continuing to invest in what he called its
"aces," its chemicals and industrial gas segments. He said
the company's strengths would warrant an increase in the
dividend were it not for the turmoil in the Mideast and
instability in the economy.
   Mr. Kennedy said Carbide expects net "proceeds" from its
asset sales to total about $600 million, roughly half of it
cash, the remainder representing debt assumed by others. The
divestitures should result in a "small, nonrecurring charge"
to earnings in the 1990 fourth quarter or the 1991 first
quarter, he said.
   Carbide said it is in negotiations with several potential
partners over the sale of as much as a 50% stake in its
carbon products business. The business, which makes graphite
electrodes for the steel industry, had pretax operating
profit of $22 million in the first half of this year on sales
of $359 million.
   Carbide said it will divest itself of its 50% stakes in
Kemet Electronics Corp., which makes capacitors for the
electronics industry, and in Lincare Inc., which provides
oxygen tanks for medical needs in the home. The company also
plans certain asset sales in its retail gases business, where
it will transfer majority control to employees through a
stock ownership plan. A broader ownership plan will be
established for employees throughout Carbide.
   To buy back stock, Carbide will hold a so-called Dutch
auction for 20 million of its 143 million shares. Holders can
tender their shares within a range of prices to be specified
Oct. 1.
