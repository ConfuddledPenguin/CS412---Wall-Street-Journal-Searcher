   PARIS -- Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine said it plans a
2-for-1 stock split to help improve liquidity in the
secondary market for its stock.
   The French state-controlled oil group said the split will
take effect Nov. 23 and will cut the nominal value of its
stock to five French francs (95 cents) a share from 10
francs. Elf said the split won't have any impact on its
share-purchase warrants, as they expire Oct. 19.
