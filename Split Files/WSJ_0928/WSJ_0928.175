   WASHINGTON -- Electric utility companies, already
concerned about a long-term shortage of capacity, worry that
pending federal legislation is only going to make matters
worse.
   In a revised annual 10-year forecast, the North American
Electric Reliability Council cited pending changes in the
Clean Air Act as "the most significant threat" to reliability
of electrical power.

   Michehl R. Gent, vice president of the council, said the
main concern is that many electric-power companies will find
it too expensive to meet new strict pollution-control
standards and will be forced to close older facilities sooner
than planned. Such a development, Mr. Gent said, could
exacerbate the pressing power-supply situation in many parts
of the country, particularly areas east of the Mississippi
River.
   Already power companies have been forced to reduce voltage
in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern parts of the country
when demand exceeded available supplies during extreme cold
or hot spells.
   The Reliability Council, formed by utility companies and
comprising nine regional groups, attempts to provide a
long-range industry view of the nation's electric-power
needs.
   Even without stricter pollution-control legislation,
however, the growing demand for electricity -- especially in
peak summer and winter periods -- has a lot of energy experts
worried. In its report released yesterday, the council, for
example, increased by 5% its estimates of peak utility demand
for 1997.
   While energy experts say short-term power supplies should
be adequate, the long-term picture is less assuring. Although
conceding that forecasting energy demand is tricky, the
latest study predicts that the U.S. will need an additional
7,500 megawatts of power-generating capability in the 1990s
if it wants to keep up with demand and provide reliable
service. That 7,500-megawatt figure is lower than the 13,000
megawatts the council projected last year, but is still
disturbing, says Mr. Gent. Officials said the figure declined
because of improved forecasting methods, rather than a drop
in expected demand.
   Nonetheless, electric utilities are continuing to slow
down construction of new facilities. The NERC's latest study
shows that construction isn't yet under way on 55% of the new
generating capacity previously announced for the next 10
years in the U.S. That gap is up from 41% last year and just
30% two years ago. Thus, forecasters worry that there's more
risk that power mightn't be available when it is needed.
   Some utility regulators are also worried about the impact
of the new legislation. "Everyone is in favor of clean air,"
says Cas Robinson, a member of the Georgia Public Service
Commission. "But is the public willing to pay for it?"
   Nancy Kete, a senior policy analyst at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, dismissed the notion that
the Clean Air amendments will threaten the nation's
electric-power supplies. "I don't think it's a well-founded
fear. The EPA is just as concerned as anybody about
electricity reliability. When it {the legislation} is
explained, they will realize it won't make a big difference
in energy supply," she said.
   Slowing the pace of adding capacity is the complicated
question of what type of fuel should be used to generate
electricity. At the moment, more than half of the nation's
electric power comes from coal-burning generators. Natural
gas, oil, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources
generate the rest. But with growing environmental pressures
and fear of deeper dependence on foreign oil supplies, the
utilities are left struggling to find economical and
environmentally safe solutions.
   In the past, electric utilities facing capacity crunches
have been able to turn to their neighbors to buy extra power.
Those days, however, may be numbered. As the strains on
capacity spread, experts say neighboring utilities may be
more reluctant to sell.
