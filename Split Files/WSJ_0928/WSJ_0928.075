   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is "an
agency under stress" whose shortage of funds could cast doubt
on its "ability to perform its many tasks satisfactorily,"
according to an interim report by a blue-ribbon task force.
   The task force was appointed by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan earlier this year in the wake of
much unfavorable publicity for the agency, including
disclosures of fraud in the generic-drug approval process.
Several FDA officials were convicted for accepting bribes
from drug companies.

   The interim report didn't address the generic-drug scandal
itself, but it did refer to "weakened public confidence" in
the agency's ability to do its job.
   The panel is chaired by Charles C. Edwards, a former FDA
commissioner. Another panel member is David Kessler, who is
widely believed to be Dr. Sullivan's choice to head the FDA,
which has been leaderless since the departure of Frank Young
in November. No formal nomination has been made for the post,
which requires Senate confirmation.
   Because the task force isn't expected to finish its
inquiry until next year, the findings of this report are
tentative. Nevertheless, the report did note that the FDA is
"hampered in many areas by shaken morale," and is "short of
equipment, facilities, and basic infrastructure."
   The report also said the FDA's ability to rapidly develop
new regulations and propose new laws was hampered by
"multiple review procedures," an apparent reference to
current requirements that FDA actions be approved by
officials at HHS, of which the FDA is a division. Among the
solutions the panel pledged to consider is to allow the FDA
commissioner to issue regulations on his own, as was the case
before 1981.
   Although the FDA regulates 25% of the nation's gross
national product, its fiscal 1990 appropriation is a
comparatively small $601 million. During the past decade,
Congress substantially added to the FDA's responsibilities
over items ranging from artificial heart valves to eye
shadow, but the agency's budget didn't grow significantly
larger, after inflation, than it was in 1980.
   In a letter to Dr. Edwards, Dr. Sullivan wrote that he
supports "additional resources in selected areas for the FDA"
but noted "significant limitations we can expect on the
federal budget." He also urged the committee to look into the
areas of product review and regulatory enforcement.
