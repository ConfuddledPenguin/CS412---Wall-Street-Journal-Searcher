   HOUSTON -- Tenneco Inc. said it and a number of investors
concluded definitive agreements with Georgia Pacific Corp.
for the purchase of various Georgia-Pacific assets for about
$740 million. Earlier this month the companies disclosed
preliminary negotiations.
   The transaction is expected to close by year end, Tenneco
said.

   Under the agreements, Tenneco's Packaging Corp. of America
unit will purchase 19 cardboard container assembly plants
located primarily in the south and southeast, and cutting
rights on timberland previously leased to Georgia Pacific.
   In addition, GE Capital Corp. agreed to buy two cardboard
container materials plants and lease them to Packaging Corp.
Tenneco has options to purchase the facilities at the end of
an undisclosed lease term. GE Capital is the finance arm of
General Electric Corp., Fairfield, Conn.
   Tenneco said John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. agreed to purchase from
Georgia Pacific and lease to Packaging Corp. 540,000 acres of
timberland in four states.
   Tenneco also said it will make a $50 million working
capital infusion into Packaging Corp., which makes paperboard
and containerboard products and plastic and aluminum
packaging.
