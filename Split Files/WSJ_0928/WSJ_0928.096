   DETROIT -- Rising gasoline prices and fears of recession
may be taking a toll on what has been the hottest segment of
the auto market for the past five years: light trucks.
   General Motors Corp. said yesterday that it's temporarily
idling four factories or assembly lines that make pickup
trucks, sport-utility vehicles and chassis for recreational
and commercial vehicles because of slow sales. The company
didn't announce the shutting of any car-assembly plants.

   Ford Motor Co. said it is closing its Edison, N.J., plant
that assembles Ranger pickup trucks for one week, starting
Monday. But the company said the shutdown comes from
production considerations, not slow sales.
   Still, while domestic car sales have climbed about 1% so
far this month from a year earlier, sales of trucks dropped
8.2%. It's just the reverse of the dominant sales pattern of
recent years, as consumers have shifted from cars to minivans
and other trucks, many of which consume more gas than all but
the biggest cars.
   Many dealers say they have seen a slowdown in light-truck
business since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August sent
energy prices soaring. "Showroom traffic has dropped
considerably since oil prices went up," says Darrell McClure,
GMC trucks sales manager at Bill Farley Pontiac-GMC in
Birmingham, Ala.
   "You got to be a real true-blue truck buyer to buy one at
this point," says Dave Bacon, a sales manager for the Forest
Lake Ford and Chrysler dealerships in Minnesota. "Before we
were just selling them to people who liked the looks of the
trucks."
   Many analysts say it's too early to declare that soaring
gasoline prices are the main culprit. "Higher gas prices
certainly hurt new vehicles sales, but the overriding factor
is just the drop in consumer confidence in general," says
analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
   Still, some dealers report strong sales for certain big
trucks. For example, Friendly Chevrolet in Dallas still is
selling plenty of its big Suburban passenger vans, says Steve
Fly, the dealership's retail truck manager.
   GM plans to idle the four truck operations for between a
week and four weeks. The longest shutdown is planned at the
Detroit plant that assembles chassis for recreational and
commercial vehicles. That plant closed last Monday and isn't
expected to reopen until Oct. 22. A GM plant in Ohio that
assembles compact pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles
also closed Monday and will reopen Oct. 8.
   In addition, GM plans to idle an assembly line in Flint,
Mich., that assembles chassis for crew cabs for one week,
starting Monday. And a second GM assembly line in Flint that
makes full-sized Jimmy models and Chevrolet Blazers is slated
to close for two weeks, starting Monday.
   Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers planned to build
137,288 cars this week, down 9.2% from 151,228 a year
earlier.
   Ford said it scheduled Saturday overtime at its Wayne,
Mich., car-assembly plant that builds the Escort and at its
Kansas City and St. Louis truck plants.
   GM said it scheduled Saturday overtime at its Bowling
Green, Ky., assembly plant that builds the Chevrolet
Corvette. In addition, GM said it will work overtime today at
its Janesville, Wis., plant that builds the Chevrolet
Cavalier.
   Chrysler Corp. said it is cutting its St. Louis 1 plant
down to a single shift for one week, instead of the normal
two shifts, because of slow sales for the Dodge Daytona and
Chrysler LeBaron.

   CHRYSLER Corp.'s St. Louis No. 1 plant has been operating
on a single eight-hour production shift since Feb. 12, and is
scheduled to remain on that schedule until the plant closes
permanently next May. In Friday's edition, it was incorrectly
stated that Chrysler was cutting production to one shift from
two shifts for one week only.
