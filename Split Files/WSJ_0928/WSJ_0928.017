   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission plans to let
Japanese auto makers have as much as 11% of the French and
Italian markets by the end of 1998, more than triple their
current share, a senior EC official said.
   The figure is part of a so-called voluntary agreement for
Japanese auto makers to gradually increase their potential
share in the protected EC market after the planned
unification of the 12 EC nations' markets in 1992. The
tentative accord was worked out in private talks in recent
months between the EC Commission and Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.

   In Spain, the commission intends to allow Japanese makers
as much as 19% of the auto market.
   The French and Italian governments have objected to the
allotment as too generous. But the EC official said the 11%
figure represents the upper limit that Japanese car makers
would be likely to reach eight years from now. If European
car makers become more competitive, the official said, the
Japanese share could be lower.
   Japanese auto makers currently are restricted to less than
3% of the market in France, 1.5% in Italy and 1.2% in Spain.
In EC nations that haven't imposed such curbs, Japanese car
makers already have significant market shares. For example,
Japanese manufacturers have 15% of the auto market in West
Germany, 20% in Belgium and 40% in Ireland.
