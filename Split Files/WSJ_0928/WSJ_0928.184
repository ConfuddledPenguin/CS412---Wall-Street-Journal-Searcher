   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators were approaching a
compromise that would limit tax deductions for the rich and
reduce the tax bite on capital gains less than President Bush
was asking, people close to the talks said.
   The package on the table as the talks continued last night
also would tax more of Social Security benefits paid to
middle- and upper-income elderly.

   "We're awfully close to having an agreement in principle .
. . which would require a White House foray" today to brief
the president, a Republican staffer close to the talks said.
   But Democratic aides cautioned that the negotiators --
five top congressional leaders and three Bush administration
officials -- hadn't yet shaken hands on an agreement. "We're
a long way from Tipperary," said one.
   Moreover, Budget Director Richard Darman cautioned against
too much optimism.
   One issue that remained unresolved was the shape of the
capital-gains tax cut. Although one option was an
administration plan to tax only those gains in excess of
inflation, an approach known as indexing, some Democrats had
reservations. Last night, Democrats were still talking about
reducing the top rate on capital gains from the current 33%.
This would be offset not only with new limits on deductions,
but also by an increase in the marginal income tax rate, now
28%, paid by the highest-income Americans. Democrats aren't
any longer pushing to raise the rate as high as 33%, however,
sources said.
   Although the specifics remained in flux, House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) briefed
Democratic members of his panel on the outlines of a possible
package to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over five
years.
   He said, and others confirmed, that the package under
discussion also included an increase to 17 cents from nine
cents a gallon in the gasoline tax, effective before the end
of 1990, to raise nearly $40 billion over five years; an
increase in taxes on alcoholic beverages to raise between $12
billion and $14 billion over five years; an increase of less
than 10 cents in the cigarette tax, currently 16 cents a
pack; and a new 10% levy on certain luxury goods. Of the $500
billion in deficit reduction over five years, about $130
billion net would come from taxes.
   Among the elements the California Democrat listed, and
confirmed by others, were a plan to raise $20 billion over
five years by subjecting to income taxes 85% of the Social
Security benefits paid to upper-income Americans. Currently,
50% of the benefits paid to couples with annual incomes above
$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 are taxed.
   Republicans had been resisting that approach for weeks,
saying it shouldn't be counted as reducing spending on Social
Security, but instead as a tax increase.
   The package is likely to be politically explosive, and
rank-and-file members of both parties have been warning their
leaders that their votes aren't assured. For all the
attention paid to capital gains, congressmen representing
working-class, urban districts said the issue was far less
relevant to their constituents than cuts in health care or
new excise taxes. "If I go back to Atlanta and say we held
the line on capital gains but we did you in on Medicare,
they'll say you're not bringing us good news," said Rep. John
Lewis (D., Ga.).
   Conversely, representatives of more affluent districts and
conservatives were troubled by the reports that negotiators
were considering tax, Medicare and Social Security changes
that aimed at middle and upper-income constituents. "They may
be agreeing on something the rest of us ain't going to buy,"
said Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.). "They'd better check with
us troops."
   In all, about $60 billion of the $500 billion in deficit
reduction over five years would come from cutting projected
Medicare spending -- including an increase in the premium the
elderly pay to cover doctor bills, the congressional sources
said. They said the premium, currently $28.60 a month, would
be raised to cover 30% of the costs of this part of the
program, up from the 25% the law currently provides. The
deductible would also be raised to $150 from $75.
   An accord in the next day or two, even if details remain
unsettled, probably would give Congress and President Bush
enough of an excuse to delay the spending cuts directed by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, cuts that are
scheduled to bite into federal spending Monday.
   Republicans have been pushing limits on tax deductions for
upper-income Americans for months as a way to offset a cut in
capital-gains taxes, which largely would benefit those same
well-off taxpayers. Initially, the GOP proposed to limit only
deductions for state and local income taxes, but later they
broadened their plan to cover all deductions.
   One variant under discussion by negotiators, which
resembles proposals crafted by Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio),
would limit overall deductions for taxpayers with incomes
above $100,000. A taxpayer with income of $150,000, for
instance, would face a floor of $5,000 (10% of the difference
between $150,000 and $100,000). If the taxpayer's deductions
totaled $45,000, he would be allowed to deduct only $40,000
(or $45,000 minus $5,000). But details weren't firm last
night.
   One reason the Democrats are so intent on completing the
task that began in May is that they fear they'll be blamed if
the government isn't able to keep operating after the fiscal
year begins Monday. House Democrats were inclined to pass a
Democratic alternative budget to put the onus on Mr. Bush for
the failure of the budget talks. But that plan was scrapped
after Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) that he didn't have
the votes in the Senate to pass such a bill.
   Negotiations shifted to the dinner table at one point last
night, as the three administration bargainers -- Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu and Mr. Darman -- invited themselves to join Sen.
Mitchell in the senators' private dining room.
   But even as his top advisers were working to narrow their
differences with Congress in Washington, Mr. Bush was
criticizing congressional Democrats in campaign speeches in
the Midwest. "Congress has got to stop being manic depressive
-- manic on spending, depressive for the economy," he said.
   In discussions of how to structure a cut in capital-gains
taxes -- one of President Bush's campaign promises and a
sticking point in the talks from the start -- negotiators
also have talked about targeting an additional tax break on
investments in start-up companies.
   The negotiators also tentatively agreed to permanently
extend tax credits for research and development spending and
for people who build low-income housing. The plan also would
temporarily extend some other soon-to-expire tax breaks.
   To help low-income individuals, the plan would increase
the refundable earned-income tax credit for the working poor,
and Democrats were pressing for an increase in the standard
deduction taken by taxpayers who don't itemize.
   One issue that remained unsettled was whether to include
an expansion of the child-care tax credit in the
deficit-reduction package. Although such a provision could be
costly, it also would help satisfy Democrats' demand that the
overall package not hit lower- and middle-income Americans
harder than those in upper-income brackets.
   Although plans to alter the congressional budget process
get little attention outside Washington, they remain an
important part of the negotiations. Democrats appear ready to
agree to Republican demands that any package include new
fixed deficit targets for the next five years, rather than
simply deficit-reduction goals. Total appropriations would be
capped for each of the five years, but Democrats have
resisted Republican demands to specify the ceilings on
defense and non-defense spending for each year as well.
   One sticky issue, however, is whether the Appropriations
committees would be permitted to use some additional
gasoline-tax revenues for highway spending in excess of the
ceilings.
   The talks began in mid-May at the call of President Bush
whose advisers urged him to seek a deficit compromise to help
bring down interest rates and reduce the risk of recession.
But the talks, which initially involved 21 members of
Congress, made little headway until the president disavowed
his no-new-taxes campaign pledge on June 26.
   Even after that, the talks sputtered along through the
summer. After Labor Day, the bargainers secluded themselves
at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, taking over the officers'
bar and VIP bungalows. What started as a weekend stay became
an 11-day ordeal, and the hoped-for candor and compromise was
lost amid recrimination over news leaks.
   Finally, 10 days ago, the five highest-ranking
congressional leaders and the three administration officials
excluded others from the bargaining table, and returned to
the Capitol for the latest intensive round. In the end, the
fundamental differences that vexed negotiators from the start
were among the final issues to be resolved: the balance
between taxes, cuts in domestic spending and cuts in defense
spending.
   As reported previously, negotiators have agreed roughly to
reduce spending on benefit programs by about $120 billion and
defense spending by about $170 billion, in addition to
raising revenues by about $130 billion over five years,. The
remaining $70 billion in deficit reduction would come from
lower-than-forecast interest payments.
