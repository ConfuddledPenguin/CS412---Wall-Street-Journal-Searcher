   NEW YORK -- In its rush to analyze the effects of the
Middle East crisis, the stock market seems to be all but
ignoring the most glaringly obvious beneficiary.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the price of crude
oil has almost doubled and that of gasoline has spurted about
30%. Not surprisingly, stocks of oil consumers, such as
chemical companies and airlines, are down, and those of
oil-service firms are up.

   But the stocks of companies feeling the most immediate and
significant effects -- the major "integrated" oil companies
-- haven't risen at all. In fact, they have fallen.
   Shares of Mobil, Exxon, Kerr-McGee, Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron, among others, are all down from their Aug. 2
invasion-day price. Others, such as Arco, British Petroleum
and Unocal, are up, but none by more than a few percentage
points. And this is so even though the earnings outlook for
the integrated majors has brightened considerably.
   "As far as the oil stocks are concerned, the invasion of
Kuwait never took place," says PaineWebber analyst Bryan
Jacoboski.
   In fact, the Dow Jones index of major integrated oil
companies is actually down by 3% since Aug. 1. "I've been
mystified that they haven't gone up," says First Boston's
William Randol.
   Analysts have a great many reasons for this -- but none of
them really explain the failure of stocks to reflect the
improved outlook for oil-industry profits. Indeed, they have
so many reasons, one suspects that they, too, are groping for
an answer. "The market has its own logic," says Salomon
Brothers' Bernard Picchi.
   The logic, in this case, is as follows: Oil companies reap
significant profits from chemicals, which have been hurt by
developments in the Middle East. And the price of gasoline,
analysts note, hasn't risen by as much as crude -- thus,
profit margins at the marketing end of the business have all
but disappeared.
   Still others make the point that because the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index is down by 15% since Aug. 1, oil
stocks haven't done all that badly in relative terms. And
then there is the argument of Alan Gaines, president of
institutional broker Gaines &amp; Berland -- that a higher oil
price will cause a broad recession and thus lower demand for
oil in the future.
   All of these points are worthy of thought, but none change
a simple fact: Earnings of the integrated oil majors should
be up -- way up, unless oil prices collapse almost
immediately. Mr. Picchi, of Salomon, says "we're looking for
a 25% to 30% upward revision in profits for 1991 versus our
previous forecast," assuming that the average price of oil
next year is $27 a barrel.
   William Brown, of Kidder, Peabody, assumes an oil price of
only $25 a barrel in 1991. His earnings estimates are up by
about 20%. The magnitude of the trend may not be clear, but
the direction is.
   Mr. Picchi argues that even before the invasion, he and
some others were predicting that oil's price would rise --
though much more gradually -- and that stocks may have
already reflected that view.
   "The five-year improvement we expected in the price of oil
took place in five weeks," he says. But, Mr. Picchi concedes,
it is one thing to predict higher oil prices; it is another
to experience them. And, he adds, oil companies now are
trading at a relatively modest five or six times projected
cash flow.
   Analysts make the point that no one is sure how long the
Mideast crisis will last. And eventually, according to the
common wisdom, oil prices will retreat -- perhaps severely.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for future delivery
in April 1992 is priced at $26.54 a barrel -- $13 less than
oil for immediate delivery, reflecting the view that prices
are bound to fall off sharply.
   But it is also true that if war breaks out, oil prices may
rise. And whatever happens, everyone's estimate for future
oil prices is higher than it was on Aug. 1.
   "A lot of other factors are involved," PaineWebber's Mr.
Jacoboski explains. Government, he says, may mandate
conservation, or raise taxes on fuels, or encourage people
who burn gasoline to switch to windmills, and so forth.
   But none of these factors overly discouraged Mr. Jacoboski
when it was time to advise his clients. Before the invasion
he was touting five of the 17 companies he follows; now, he
recommends 15.
   His and other people's clients don't seem to be listening.
"Fund managers hate to be blindsided," he says, adding: "If
you accept that oil prices will be higher, you are accepting
that the economy will be weak. You have to restructure your
entire portfolio."
