   NEW YORK -- Amerada Hess Corp. said its Canadian
subsidiary completed the acquisition of oil and gas producing
properties owned by a subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc.
   Amerada Minerals Corp. of Canada acquired 80% of the
producing properties and 250,000 exploration acres from
Placer Cego Petroleum Holdings Ltd. for about $215 million.
The cost was 17% lower than Amerada stated last July; a
spokesman said the earlier cost of $260 million dropped
because of adjustments.

   Amerada Minerals said it expects the properties, which are
principally in Alberta and British Columbia, to produce
14,000 barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids
by 1992.
