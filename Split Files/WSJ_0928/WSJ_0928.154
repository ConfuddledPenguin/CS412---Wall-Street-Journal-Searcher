   Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti has withdrawn from a
clash with one of Portugal's businessmen, Manuel da Silva
Reis. A spokeswoman for Cerus S.A., the Paris-based firm that
runs Mr. De Benedetti's European investments, confirmed it
plans to sell its 40% stake in Real Companhia Velha, a
leading port wine producer controlled by Mr. Silva Reis.
   Real Companhia Velha is one of Portugal's oldest and
largest port wine producers. Founded in 1756 as a
state-backed monopoly to oversee the port industry, it
accounted for nearly 12% of world-wide port sales volume last
year.

   Cerus's Portuguese holding company, Cofipsa, which groups
Mr. De Benedetti and other European partners with Portuguese
partners, agreed to take the 40% stake last year, when Mr.
Silva Reis was looking for outside help to overcome financial
difficulties. But differences soon arose between new
management brought in by the De Benedetti group and Mr. Silva
Reis.
   Mr. Silva Reis and his family are to remain as the
company's principal shareholders.
