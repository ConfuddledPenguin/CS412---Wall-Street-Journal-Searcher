   NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Inc. is negotiating with the estate
of Henry Ford II to auction art works valued at an estimated
$50 million to $70 million from the late auto magnate's
collection.
   The New York-based auction unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
beat out Christie's International PLC of London in a bidding
war for the right to sell the prestigious collection,
according to people in the art world and an internal memo
circulated by Christie's.

   Christie's memo said that the firm had lost the collection
purely on financial grounds and that matching or out-bidding
Sotheby's offer to guarantee a minimum sale price for the
collection would have "put the company at risk." Christopher
Burge, president of the Christie's USA unit, said the art
works are "jolly nice paintings," but "our rivals were
prepared to offer a higher guarantee in this uncertain
market."
   Sotheby's declined to comment on the sale. Frank Chopin,
attorney for Kathleen DuRoss Ford, widow of Mr. Ford, said
"some part of his collection will, in fact, be sold, probably
in November and probably at Sotheby's."
   The collection includes works by Paul Cezanne, Amedeo
Modigliani and Pierre Auguste Renoir that haven't been on the
market in over 30 years.
   The Ford works would be the first major single-owner art
collection to come on the market this fall in a sales season
for which the auction houses have been trying to lower public
expectations. (Sotheby's upcoming sale of the Greta Garbo
estate, though a big name collection, features mostly
midrange paintings and furniture.)
   Both Sotheby's and Christie's have said they are trimming
the size of the auctions in an attempt to rein in the
substantial percentage of unsold works that marked some of
last spring's auctions in New York and London. The high
unsold, or buy-in, rates at some of those auctions raised
doubts about the strength of the art market.
   The prestigious Ford name, plus the fact that most of the
estate's paintings are fresh to the market, made this
collection extremely desirable to both houses, sources said.
   The $50 million to $70 million that the collection is
expected to fetch would nearly double the $80 million
Sotheby's had earlier estimated its major fall Impressionist
auction would take in. At last spring's Impressionist
auction, the firm took in $286 million, an amount that was
boosted by the $78.1 million paid by a Japanese collector for
a Renoir similar to one hanging in the Musee d'Orsay in
Paris.
   Sotheby's is expected to announce next week that a special
sale of the Ford collection will be held on Monday, Nov. 13.
The sale would kick off the fall Impressionist sale week that
brings the major auction houses a substantial chunk of their
annual revenue.
   In an eleventh-hour race for the right to sell the
collection, Sotheby's and Christie's were given only days to
estimate prices on all the works, many of which are in
Detroit, and prepare their bids and financial statements,
people familiar with the bidding said. Any delay would have
postponed the sale until the December auctions in London.
   Competition between Sotheby's and Christie's was
particularly keen because both houses have close ties to the
Ford family. Henry Ford II was formerly vice chairman of
Sotheby's, and his widow, Kathleen, is a friend of Judy
Taubman, wife of Sotheby's chairman A. Alfred Taubman. Mr.
Ford had also previously sold art at Christie's, and his
first wife, Anne Ford Johnson, works in international
relations at Christie's.
   While negotiations aren't final, the arrangement being
worked out would essentially be an underwriting of the
collection, with Sotheby's putting its own capital at risk,
people close to the negotiations said. They said Ford heirs
would be guaranteed a total take -- even if buyers don't bid
that high -- plus a percentage of any proceeds above that
total.
   Through a guarantee arrangement, an auction house,
normally an impartial go-between, accepts some of the
downside risk of an auction. An auction house normally sets
the guarantee at about 80% of the lower estimated price for
the work in order to protect itself. But people familiar with
the bidding between Sotheby's and Christie's said competition
was so keen that Sotheby's proposed guarantee was even more
aggressive than the 80%.
   Henry Ford II died in 1987, and a feud over his $350
million estate quickly ensued. The primary heir to the Ford
trust, Kathleen DuRoss Ford, is a former model who married
Mr. Ford in 1980. Upon her death, the trust flows to Mr.
Ford's six grandchildren. Since Mr. Ford's death, the Ford
heirs have repeatedly gone to court over issues of
trusteeship.
