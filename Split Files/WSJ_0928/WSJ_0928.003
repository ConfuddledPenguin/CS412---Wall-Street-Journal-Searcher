   Las Vegas -- In the lobby and casino of the new Mirage
Hotel, Las Vegas's version of Grand Central Station, people
in amazing numbers mill and churn, but James "Buster"
Douglas, the undisputed heavyweight boxing champion of the
world, has a spacious mezzanine area to himself in which to
prepare for his Oct. 25 title fight with Evander Holyfield.
   Douglas's training has been closed to the public, but not,
he avers, to keep prying eyes from glimpsing an unseemly
spare tire around his waist. "I want to be with just my own
people, gettin' serious," he says. "I read where I weigh
250-260 pounds, but that's not true. I'm at 240, 241. I'll be
down to 230 easy by fight time." He was wearing a bulky sweat
shirt when he said it, so I couldn't attempt to confirm his
assertion.

   As for the fact that the sports book downstairs has him --
the champ -- an almost-2-to-1 underdog to the former Olympic
medalist, Buster widens his eyes, the way Ali used to.
   "Oh yes]" he exclaims. "Holyfield's a tremendous fighter]
He's always in wonderful shape. Unbeaten and untied. Very
strong. Throws combinations. Great chin."
   And how about you, Buster?
   "You ain't supposed to look at me," grins the big,
soft-faced man who will outweigh his foe at fight time by
about 20 pounds, and significantly outreach him with his
83-inch arm span. "Just keep your eyes on him for now."
   But it has been hard to keep one's eyes off Buster Douglas
of late. First came that February evening in Toyko when he
shocked the known universe by knocking out Mike Tyson, who
was not only unbeaten and untied but also virtually unscored
upon, to capture sport's most prestigious crown.
   Then came a bout that won't appear on his record, but was
tougher than many that do. His opponent was Don King,
boxing's octopus, who, having done his best to nullify the
outcome of the Tokyo tiff in favor of preferred-client Tyson,
turned his attention to enforcing the ever-after clause he
extracts from fighters he controls.
   Douglas got a draw with King, which is as good as anyone
has done since the state of Ohio nailed King for
manslaughter. King's suit to retain promotional links with
Douglas was settled out of court, with the promoter receiving
a reported $3 million. That seems like a lot until one notes
that the projected take from the Douglas-Holyfield fight,
which King won't be promoting, is $35 million, and that
Buster's share will come to $24 million.
   "It's been a fight since the fight," observes Douglas of
his legal scrap with King, but he says he never doubted its
outcome, or that of the ring battle that preceded it.
"Sometimes I can be, like, outside myself, watching what's
going on. It's like watching a TV show with me in it. I knew
the Tyson fight and the King thing would come out all right
for me. And that's the way it happened."
   The 30-year-old Douglas's premonition about the Tyson
match wasn't reflected in the odds, which were 40-or-50-to-1
in favor of Tyson in establishments that deigned to accept
wagers, or in Douglas's record. Buster entered that fray with
a 29-4-1 mark, the losses coming from fights with such
non-luminaries as David Bey, Mike White, Jesse Ferguson and
Tony Tucker.
   Douglas has labored as a pro since 1981, but since 1984
had fought no more than three times a year, partly because
few fellow pugilists lusted to tangle with a long-armed,
6-foot-4 guy who could punch. His biggest pre-Tyson paycheck
was the $200,000 he earned against Tucker in a 1987 match for
the IBF belt. He led early in that one, but faded and was
stopped in 10 rounds.
   All the while, though, he was learning. Douglas took up
boxing as a pre-teen in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, under
the tutelage of his father, Billy, an ex-pug, but he gave it
up at 15 for other sports. When the need to make a living
arose, he returned to the ring at age 21.
   "I didn't have many amateur fights, and no money behind
me. Nobody was finding guys for me to fight who'd fit my
style," he says. "I fought anybody who'd fight me. I'd sign
blank contracts and let the promoter fill in the opponent's
name. Sometimes I didn't know who I'd be fighting until the
day of the fight. Sometimes I was the opponent, if you get my
meaning.
   "But I learned what I could and couldn't do, and how I
should and shouldn't train. And I had a plan for Tyson. It
was to face him like a man. Nobody'd done that before."
   Douglas did more than face up to the intimidating Iron
Mike. He popped him with long lefts and rights, and tied him
up when he lunged in. He wobbled Tyson with combinations in
the fifth and ninth rounds before finishing him in the 10th.
Arguably, Douglas won every round, including the eighth until
he was floored by the uppercut that sparked the "long count"
flap that King, Tyson's pal, promoter and de facto manager,
fanned so energetically.
   "I was more surprised than hurt" by the knockdown punch,
recalls Douglas. He adds: "Things were going so good I found
myself watching, thinking `Look at me, I'm beatin' him up]'
The knockdown got my mind back on business."
   Douglas shrugs off questions about his plan for Holyfield,
remarking "I know he comes in and I like that. I like an
opponent to be there." He leaves the expected opponent-abuse
to his trainer, John Russell, who happily obliges. Holyfield,
declares Russell, is a "pumped-up light heavy, a 210-pound
guy with skinny legs and a 32-inch waist. Put him next to
Buster, it's like a boy next to a man. You can believe your
eyes about this one."
   Buster smiles and turns to possible future outings. Yes,
he says, he'd like to fight Tyson again one day, despite the
ex-champ's King connection, but first he wants to meet George
Foreman, the 42-year-old, 260-pound, ex-ex-champ.
   "I've seen films of George, and he's improving," says
Buster, eyes atwinkle. "He does things he never did before.
He used to load up for one big punch, but now he throws
combinations. If I don't get to him soon, he'll be too good
for me. Maybe too good for anybody."
