   The day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Clark Johnson, chairman
of the fast-growing Pier 1 Imports retail chain, noticed a
marked drop-off in his stores' business. One week later, when
President Bush ordered troops to the Persian Gulf, store
traffic tumbled again.
   As a result, yellow lights are blinking at the successful
Fort Worth, Texas, retailer of furniture and home
furnishings, and 18 of the 84 new stores it had planned to
open in coming months have been put on hold. "I am much less
sanguine about our prospects than earlier this year," says
Mr. Johnson.

   The Persian Gulf crisis contributed to a change in plans
at Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa. The company
is trying to buy six radio and TV stations but recently cut
back its planned offering price by 20%. "We aren't willing to
stretch as we might have been a few months ago," says
Heritage Chairman James Hoak.
   National Graphics Co. of Atlanta has also gone into a
state of suspended animation. The company needs a new
printing press but has delayed the purchase "until the
economy has some better predictability to it," says Tim
Combs, the chief executive.
   The three companies illustrate one of the most troublesome
economic casualties of the Iraqi crisis. Economists have been
cranking up models that show how the spike in oil prices will
affect utilities, trucking companies, chemical companies and
others that directly depend on petroleum. But prospects of
Mideast mayhem have also dealt a psychological blow to
thousands of businesses that don't depend heavily on oil.
   U.S. business, in short, has a bad case of Iraqnophobia.
   "This makes what was already an uncertain business
environment even more uncertain," says Eastman Kodak Co.
Chairman Kay Whitmore. "It heaps uncertainty on top of
uncertainty." And businessmen hate uncertainty.
   In better economic times, the problems in the Persian Gulf
might have been less of a jolt to business confidence. But
they follow a litany of economic ills: the breakdown of the
savings and loan industry, a sharp downturn in regional
real-estate markets, bankruptcy and consolidation in the
retail industry, federal budgetary gridlock, rising problems
in the banking industry and a growing credit squeeze.
   For many business people, skyrocketing oil prices and the
possibility of war are too much. "I think everybody said
that's the last straw," says Thomas Darden, chief executive
of the Cherokee Sanford Group, a North Carolina brick maker.
"Most people wouldn't conceive of taking a risk in this
environment."
   To be sure, the businesses most affected are still those
directly connected to oil. The airline industry, for
instance, has been thrown into confusion because fuel is such
a huge portion of airlines' costs. Rising oil prices also are
starting to ooze into other parts of the economy, as
manufacturers of chemicals, plastics, and other products made
of petroleum try to raise prices.
   "There are a lot of legitimate price increases on resins
and chemicals," says Carroll Britt, director of purchasing
for Hatteras Yachts in North Carolina, "and then there are a
lot of people using the Middle East as an excuse to put
prices through that have no relation to oil."
   But the economic impact is by no means limited to those
direct effects. Polls show that public attitudes changed
sharply after the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, with fears of
recession soaring. Confidence is clearly declining among
consumers and business people.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, for
instance, found "a wait-and-see attitude" in its September
survey, says Robert Bretz, chairman of the group's business
survey committee.
   The wariness, though most evident in manufacturing, is
present in all sectors. "I don't care whether you are in
manufacturing, retailing, restaurants or services, you are
feeling the effect of uncertainty," says Thomas Skala,
president of Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I.
   The result could be a sharp decline in planned capital
outlays for the coming months. The latest Commerce Department
survey of business spending plans, conducted in July, before
the Iraqi invasion, showed U.S. companies expected a modest
5.4% increase in business spending next year. That was down
substantially from the first of the year, and the Iraq crisis
is nearly certain to pull it down further.
   Some companies have already announced changes in spending
plans. Marriott Corp. this week said it is putting on hold
most of its plans to build hotels next year. Champion
International has said it will defer a new pulp mill in
Brazil and the conversion of a paper mill in the U.S.
   "With the likelihood of a softer economy ahead, this was a
logical place to defer," says Champion's chairman, Andrew
Sigler.
   Consultants are watching clients hunker down. "I've been
making calls to industrial clients, and they are seeing
either hesitation among their customers, or they are
themselves cutting back," says Gary Shilling, an economic
consultant in New York. "Some are really in the bomb
shelters, pulling the metal doors down."
   Advertising spending, one of the first areas to feel the
effects of changing business sentiment, is also taking a
blow. "People are more concerned about the economic outlook,"
says Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group and
an advertising specialist. "Advertising expenses are one of
the really easy things for businesses to cut." Mr. Winger
speculates that the actual onset of a recession might help
the advertising business, by ending the current uncertainty.
"Everyone is very cautious because we don't know what's going
to happen," he says. "As soon as you say the recession's
here, people may breathe a sigh of relief."
   The prospect of less advertising spending has caused
Heritage Communications to cut its offering price for new
radio and TV stations. Mr. Hoak says the company's
advertisers are no longer willing to commit to buying time in
advance. "People are making decisions at the last possible
moment," he says, "and some are trying to cancel previous
commitments."
   The result: "You have to live more hand-to-mouth,
day-to-day," he says. "You can't plan your business out."
   National Graphics illustrates that new, day-to-day
business existence. A small commercial printing company with
about $6 million in sales, the Atlanta company had decided
last year to buy a new press for $750,000 to $1 million. But
Mr. Combs, the chief executive, fears customers hit by higher
oil prices may cut back their orders. "We just don't think we
have enough confidence in the next six months" to invest in
the new press, he says.
   With the Mideast conflict casting so many unknowns across
the economy, business people are finding it difficult even to
formulate budgets. "We are trying to do our budget for 1991,"
says Mr. Britt of Hatteras Yachts, "but it is very tough."
   Some business people say questions about government policy
compound the confusion caused by the Mideast crisis. With oil
prices rising and the economy slumping, they say it is
unclear whether the Federal Reserve's next move on interest
rates will be up or down.
   "In my opinion, the single most important uncertainty is
Federal Reserve policy," says Walter Joelson, chief economist
at General Electric Co. "It's unclear whether the Fed is
going to conduct an anti-inflation policy, or respond with a
fairly liberal policy to preserve the integrity of the
banking system. That makes an enormous difference."
   The continued grappling over the federal budget deficit
has also worsened the problem. "I've never known a time when
the obvious question of how to manage the economy was so
clear, and yet we aren't doing anything about it," complains
Kodak Chairman Whitmore. "I'm sure a lot of the capital
markets of the world are looking to the budget negotiations."
If a credible budget agreement is reached, he predicts,
interest rates would probably drop and business confidence be
bolstered.
   The combination of budget and Middle East worries is
causing double trouble for Versar Inc., an environmental
risk-management firm in Springfield, Va. With environmental
concerns on the rise, it had expected 1990 to be a "banner
year."
   But Versar depends heavily on business with the federal
government. And Michael Markels, Versar's president, fears
the Persian Gulf crisis could cause the Pentagon to cut back
work in the environmental area to pay for operations in the
Mideast.
   Even companies staying the course wonder how long the
Mideast conflict will permit them to continue doing so. "We
see no effects that I'm aware of at the moment, but we feel
quite certain there are going to be some in the near future,"
says Philip Rollhaus, chief executive of Chicago-based
Quixote Corp., the parent of a group of high-tech companies.
"We're not quite sure in what shape or form they are going to
arrive, but we certainly are wondering and expecting."
