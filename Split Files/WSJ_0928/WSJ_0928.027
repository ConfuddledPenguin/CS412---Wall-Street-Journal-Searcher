   T. Boone Pickens Jr., one of the best-known corporate
raiders of the 1980s, settled charges that he misled
investors in 1988 by announcing that Mesa Petroleum L.P. was
bidding for Homestake Mining Co. and then selling Mesa's
holding after the stock jumped.
   Mr. Pickens, who bills himself publicly as a defender of
the small investor and until last week headed a
shareholder-rights group, agreed to the SEC complaint without
admitting or denying guilt. As part of the settlement, Mr.
Pickens agreed to not violate securities law in the future.
Mesa, the Dallas limited partnership of which Mr. Pickens is
chairman, also agreed to disgorge $2.3 million of profit from
the Homestake deal. It also neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing.

   Mr. Pickens and Mesa also announced settlement of a
class-action suit related to Mr. Pickens's 1984 bid to
acquire Phillips Petroleum Co. Mesa will contribute almost $5
million, and the other defendants, including Phillips, will
contribute a total of about $1.7 million for payments to
shareholders who bought Phillips stock during the two weeks
that Mr. Pickens's takeover bid was pending. Mesa and the
other defendants said they aren't admitting wrongdoing.
   The shareholders, in a suit in Delaware federal court,
claimed that they relied on Mr. Pickens's statements at the
time that he wouldn't sell any of his Phillips stock back to
Phillips "except on an equal basis with all other
shareholders." The holders claimed that Mr. Pickens received
cash for his stock plus reimbursement for his expenses that
was worth more than the securities and notes offered other
holders.
   Mesa financial adviser Sidney Tassin said the
partnership's share of both settlements will be paid from
cash reserves and isn't expected to have an impact on the
company's earnings.
   A spokesman for Mr. Pickens said there was little
connection between the two cases. "The only link is these are
two outstanding legal issues he wants to get rid of," the
spokesman said. "He wants to put all his energies into the
energy business."
   But both cases clearly raise questions involving
statements -- or lack of statements -- about Mr. Pickens's
intentions regarding stock he controlled. In both cases,
smaller investors followed Mr. Pickens in buying the
companies' shares and, in both cases, allegedly suffered
losses.
   In the SEC's case against Mr. Pickens, the agency alleged
that Mesa and partners acquired 3.8% of Homestake, or 3.5
million common shares in 1987 and 1988. Mr. Pickens and
others at Mesa decided on Feb. 28, 1988, to issue a news
release disclosing the stake and announcing an acquisition
bid for Homestake, the SEC said.
   At the same meeting, Mr. Pickens and the others discussed
a strategy where they might sell part of the Homestake
holding after the news of the Mesa acquisition bid was
disseminated, the SEC alleged.
   The next morning, Mesa announced that it was launching a
$20-a-share bid for Homestake. Homestake shares jumped on the
news, rising to more than $18 a share from about $14 a share.
But just hours later, Mesa sold 107,300 shares of Homestake
and more than 2,000 of the mining company's call options,
which become more valuable when the common stock rises, the
agency charged.
   Over the next week, without issuing any other news
release, Mesa sold more than a million Homestake shares and
1,200 more options contracts, the SEC contended. In the days
after Homestake publicly announced that it had rejected
Mesa's bid on March 7, Mesa sold an additional 2,158,600
Homestake shares, the SEC said.
   Spokesmen for Mr. Pickens and Mesa said they agreed to
settle the charges "to avoid the time, distraction and
expense of protracted litigation."
   The case is a bit of a departure for the SEC because Mesa
didn't own more than 5% of Homestake stock and, therefore,
wasn't required to file any disclosure documents with the
SEC. But once Mesa decided to issue the news release, SEC
enforcement officials said, it made a false and misleading
public statement.
   "Once you choose to speak and decide to make statements to
the market that may affect a market for a security, you have
an obligation to disclose things accurately and completely,"
said SEC enforcement director William McLucas.
