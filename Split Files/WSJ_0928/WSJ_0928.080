   Degussa AG, a West German chemical and metal concern, said
its ASTA Pharma AG unit bought a family-owned pharmaceutical
business, Temmler-Group G.m.b.H. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Temmler, which expects 1990 sales of 25 million marks
($15.9 million), makes medicines indicated for colds, asthma,
headaches, bronchitis and digestive disorders. With the
acquisition, Frankfurt-based ASTA said it expects to solidify
its national and global market strength by marketing an
additional line of products.
