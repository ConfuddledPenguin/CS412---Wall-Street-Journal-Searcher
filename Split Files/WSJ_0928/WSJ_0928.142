   Saskatchewan Oil &amp; Gas Corp., or Saskoil, said its largest
shareholder plans to reduce its stake to 10% from 28%, by
selling 145 million Canadian dollars (US$125.6 million) of
Saskoil shares to several securities dealers.
   Saskoil said the sale by Saskatchewan government-owned CIC
Industrial Interests Inc. of 10 million Saskoil shares at
C$14.50 each is expected to close next month, pending
regulatory approval.

   A spokeswoman for Saskoil, an oil and gas producer that
went public in 1986, said a group of seven securities dealers
purchased the shares for redistribution. Under provincial
law, no single investor can acquire more than 4% of Saskoil's
shares.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Saskoil's
shares closed at C$14.375 each, down C$1.125 on volume of
203,000 shares.
