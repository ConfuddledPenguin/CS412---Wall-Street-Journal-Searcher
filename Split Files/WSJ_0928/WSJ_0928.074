   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks slipped on oil again
yesterday.
   Crude oil prices increased nearly 90 cents a barrel,
sending stock prices lower again as investors continued to
grapple with the inflationary impact of higher oil prices.

   The losses left the Nasdaq Composite Index at its lowest
level since January 1988. The index closed at 341.19, down
8.84 or 2.5%.
   New York Stock Exchange issues faired somewhat better; the
Big Board composite index lost 2.16, or 1.3%, and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average shed 32.17, or 1.3%.
   While oil price movements largely dictated the stock
markets' direction, traders say other issues also continue to
influence the market. Rumors about the military standoff in
the Persian Gulf and the ongoing federal budget talks in
Washington also affected stocks, traders say.
   "The tone of the market is definitely bearish right now
and there's really nothing that's going to turn that around,"
says Len Hefter, managing director of Jefferies &amp; Co.'s OTC
desk in Dallas.
   "Until something definitive starts to happen in the Middle
East, it's going to be the same thing -- a lot of
nervousness," Mr. Hefter says.
   Nasdaq decliners overwhelmed advancers, 1,486 to 561.
Volume climbed to 153.3 million shares, up sharply from
Wednesday's 118.7 million shares.
   Traders agree that even if a budget accord is reached, it
will be only a short-term positive for stocks with the Middle
East crisis continuing to loom.
   "There are just too many negatives, too many rumors and
stories. You just can't operate intelligently in a market
when that's going on," says Robert Antolini, head of OTC
trading at Donaldson Lukfin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Oracle fell 5/8 to 5 5/8 in heavy trading yesterday after
gyrating wildly on two apparently fabricated documents
alleging Oracle is the target of a takeover bid. Oracle, a
highflying supplier of database software that has fallen on
hard times, declined to comment on the documents.
   One of the documents, which appeared to be an internal
memo from Prudential-Bache Securities, declared that "an
offshore concern is about to file its intention to acquire
Oracle as early as next week." But an official at
Prudential-Bache insisted the document was fraudulent.
   The other document, purporting to be a press release from
Hitachi Ltd., stated it was Hitachi's intention to acquire
five million of Oracle's shares. But the document contained
numerous errors and misstated Hitachi's formal name.
   On Tuesday, Oracle announced a quarterly loss that was
one-third larger than the company predicted three weeks ago.
The loss, the company's first ever, comes on the heels of
disclosures of accounting "glitches" and financial
restatements at the company. The string of disclosures has
torpedoed the company's stock, which peaked late last year at
more than $28. Oracle was the day's most active issue, as
4.77 million shares were traded.
   Other active stocks included Intel, down 3/4 to 32 on 4.2
million shares; Conner Peripherals, down 1 3/8 to 16 1/8 on
2.7 million-shares; and Sun Microsystems, down 2 to 25 3/4 on
1.6 million shares.
   NovaCare Inc. lost 1/2 to 14 5/8 as 3.2 million of its
common shares came to market at $15 each. A total of 2.2
million NovaCare shares changed hands on the day.
   Dain Bosworth equity trader Dennis Murray says that some
of the few sectors of the market that have maintained their
favored status are finally falling out of grace. "We are
seeing more and more darling stocks being taken out and
getting shot," he says.
   Among these fallen angels are health care and
biotechnology stocks, he says. In those areas yesterday,
Amgen lost 2 3/8 to 46 1/4, St. Jude Medical lost 3/4 to 26
3/4, U.S. HealthCare shed 1 3/4 to 17 7/8 and Biomet dropped
1/4 to 27 3/4.
   Pop Radio's shares lost more than a third of their value,
shedding 5 1/8 to 10 after Heritage Media suggested that the
firms' merger pact may be in jeopardy.
   Heritage Media, in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing, said it doesn't expect all conditions of the merger
to be satisified by an Oct. 31 deadline, at which time both
companies can back out of the transaction. Heritage said it
hasn't yet decided whether to proceed with the merger after
the deadline.
   Meanwhile, Nike shares fell 3 3/4 to 60 3/4. A Nike
spokesman said the firm doesn't have any news pending. He
indicated that Nike is "very comfortable" with analysts'
estimates in the range of $7.50 to $8.25 a share for the
fiscal year ending in May 1991. Nike earned $6.42 a share in
fiscal 1990.
   Action Auto Rental gained 3/4 to 2 5/8 after the company
announced plans to buy back up to three million shares.
   Software Toolworks fell 1 1/4 to 6 1/4 after Piper Jaffray
&amp; Hopwood analyst Bob Kleiber lowered his earnings estimates
for the company's 1991 and 1992 fiscal years.
   Mr. Kleiber cut his forecast for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1991, to a range of between $1.20 and $1.40 a share
and lowered his fiscal 1992 estimate to between $1.85 to
$2.15.
   Network General shed 1 7/8 to 4 1/4 after disclosing that
it expects second quarter net income to be below its first
quarter level of 13 cents a share, as adjusted for a
two-for-one stock split. Additionally, the company said that
shipments of its "WatchMaster" product have been deferred.
   Network General's disclosures prompted Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
Inc. analyst, John Rohal, to downgrade his investment rating
on the stock to "hold" from "buy" and to trim his earnings
estimate for the firm.
   OTC financial stocks continued to founder, including
insurer Cincinnati Financial, which fell 1/4 to 73 after
trading as low as 66 3/4. While a company spokesman Wednesday
said the firm knew of no reason to account for the fall,
earlier this week analysts blamed the drop on short sellers.
The stock fell 4 7/8 Wednesday.
   Among other insurance firms, Ohio Casualty dropped 1 3/4
to 29 1/4, St. Paul Cos. lost 3 to 48, Safeco dropped 1 to 26
7/8 and Provident Life shed 3/4 to 16 3/4.
   The banking sector was hit with more negative news as New
York Stock Exchange-traded Bank of Boston joined the ranks of
institutions projecting losses and reducing their quarterly
dividend payouts.
   Midlantic lost 1/2 to 7 3/8, BayBanks dropped 1 1/4 to 12
1/4, Michigan National lost 3/4 to 22 and State Street Boston
fell 7/8 to 29 1/8.
   U.S. Trust Corp. fell 3/4 to 28 3/4 on top of its 3/8 loss
Wednesday. The company said Wednesday that $16.2 million in
special charges in the third quarter would result in a loss
of about $7 million, or 77 cents a share, for the period.
Last year, U.S. Trust earned $10.5 million, or $1.05, in the
third quarter.
