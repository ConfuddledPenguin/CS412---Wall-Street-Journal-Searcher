   NEW YORK -- Rising world oil prices and the retreating
Tokyo stock market pushed the yen lower against all major
currencies. The dollar gained at the expense of the weakened
Japanese currency but fell against others.
   The greenback's mixed performance resulted from the
dominance of cross, or non-dollar, trading. Except when the
occasional rumor of war in the Mideast focused attention to
the dollar (which is believed to be a haven for investors in
times of turmoil), direct mark-yen trading offered the
liveliest action.

   The dollar is used as a medium for 95% of cross
transactions in the U.S. and for 90% in Europe. It rises
against the currency that's being sold -- in this case, the
yen -- and falls against the currencies being bought -- here,
the European currencies.
   In late New York trading, the greenback was quoted at
1.5612 marks and 1.2925 Swiss francs, down from 1.5650 marks
and 1.3015 francs late Wednesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 138 yen, up from 136.84
yen. Sterling was trading at $1.8773, up from $1.8727.
   The mark was quoted at 88.394 yen, up from 87.438 yen late
Wednesday in New York. In another active cross market, the
Swiss franc rose to 106.770 yen from 105.140 yen.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 137.95
yen, up from the 137.50 yen close there on Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5620
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5673 marks.
   Contributing to the yen's decline, prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell again Thursday. The Nikkei index of 225
stocks dropped 2.15% to 21771.91, after shedding 4.75%
Wednesday. Brokers attributed Thursday's losses to selling,
to meet margin requirements, by investors squeezed by
Wednesday's big drop.
   Oil prices continued to rise as heightened fears of war in
the Persian Gulf won the day over the U.S. decision to tap
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve on a test basis. A decision
could be made to draw down the reserve to boost oil supplies
and curb price rises.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark crude
oil contract for November delivery briefly rose above $40 a
barrel before ending at $39.54 a barrel, up 87 cents.
   Meanwhile, rumors spread that U.S. troops had entered
either Kuwait or Iraq, although a U.S. Defense Department
spokesman denied them.
   But the rumblings about the Middle East caused no more
than short-lived blips in currency prices because dealers say
everything short of war has been priced into the market. News
and rumors did affect the tone of trading, leaving it
occasionally volatile but ultimately directionless.
   "The market is very, very nervous," said Joseph Cambria,
New York foreign exchange manager for Banque Paribas. "You're
seeing gaps {in pricing}. The market is starting to warm up,
because people are starting to see there is a resolution
coming and that will probably be war. Things are becoming
fairly bitter."
   Mr. Cambria noted, for example, responses by U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker and the British Foreign Office
to a note Iraq sent to embassies in Kuwait. The note asked
for the names of non-diplomats inside and implied that
Westerners sheltering those persons could be hanged.
   Mr. Baker called the note "repugnant" and a British
statement said the request put to rest Iraq's "pretensions"
as a civilized state.
   A Singapore dealer said, "The Gulf crisis makes a rational
approach to the market very difficult."
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly weaker. The
unwinding of some long, or overbought, dollar positions kept
the currency on the defensive most of the day, although
prices stayed in extremely narrow ranges throughout the
session.
   The greenback finished Asian trading mostly higher, after
covering of short, or oversold, positions boosted it against
the yen early in the quiet session. The dollar was last
quoted in Tokyo Thursday at 137.50 yen, just above 137.40 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $405 an ounce, down $2. Estimated volume
was a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$404.95 an ounce.
