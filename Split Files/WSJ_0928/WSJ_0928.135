   After Poland fell to Hitler in 1939, the stalemate in
Europe became known as "the phony war." The phrase could just
as well describe the Great Budget Showdown of 1990: It's more
sitzkrieg than blitzkrieg.
   The rhetoric is flying, everyone is rattling sabers,
there's a great cry over potential casualties, but none of
the central players really wants a war. They all want a deal.
The rank-and-file politicians are treating the rest of us to
great theater, but it's mostly just uniforms and parades. The
real debate is going on, behind closed doors, among eight
middle-aged white men who will almost certainly soon emerge
with what they hope will be an immaculate conception. Both
sides want an agreement too badly to let Gramm-Rudman's
budget cuts strike this Monday.

   While most budget details remain cloistered, the spectacle
is too rich to let pass by. Everyone outside is nervous,
edgy. Some of the Democratic Study Group, the Central
Committee for House liberals, held a meeting and talked of
mutiny. When GOP House leader Bob Michel said he wanted to
give up a capital-gains cut, he was besieged by complaining
members. A few spoke of mounting a petition to challenge his
leadership at a GOP caucus.
   The metaphors grew more florid by the day. Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R., Wis.) staged a "countdown to Armageddon"; he
kept it up despite editorial ridicule. Others spoke of
"Judgment Day." Members lined up one-after-another in the
House to inoculate themselves from political blame. "It's an
Alice-in-Wonderland World," declared Connecticut Rep. Nancy
Johnson, who at least captured the essence of the spectacle.
They all want a deal so they can say the dread "sequester"
isn't their fault.
   When President Bush finally blamed Democrats for the
impasse this Wednesday, Democrats exploded. Rep. Bill Gray of
Philadelphia replied that the president "should stop playing
politics with the nation's economy." An odd accusation,
coming from a politician.
   Much of this drama is the political direction of White
House budget director Dick Darman, the David Lynch of
American politics. He's long believed in the immaculate
conception theory of the budget. The "sequester" time bomb is
his way to force the politicians to act. So he ordered
federal departments to come up with painful layoffs.
Apocalypse Darman: Carnage. Widows without grocery money.
   Mr. Darman may even have avoided a splendid chance to make
budget cuts go down more easily. The potential evasion was
provided by the so-called Civiletti memo, the Carter-era
judgment on shutting down the government. The memo, based on
an obscure federal law, arguably gives Mr. Bush power to
continue essential federal services even with a sequester. In
other words, an apocalypse seems avoidable. Airplanes can
keep flying after all.
   But Mr. Darman didn't bring this stunning news to the
budget table until this week. If he'd done it several months
ago, President Bush might have had more bargaining leverage.
He could have kept the pressure on Congress for budget cuts,
without having to spend weeks threatening a sequester
catastrophe that he too would be blamed for.
   The charitable speculation is that Mr. Darman didn't know
about the memo until recently. He distrusts lawyers (nothing
wrong with that) and has kept both the Justice Department and
the White House counsel's office isolated from his planning.
The less charitable (and unproven) inference, made by some in
the White House, is that Mr. Darman knew the memo's
importance but thought it might interfere with his summit
strategy.
   Mr. Darman's conceit is that a budget summit can settle
basic political questions by removing them from politics. (He
didn't even want Mr. Bush to make his partisan speech this
week.) GOP Sen. Phil Gramm says the agreement will determine
the country's spending "blueprint" for the next five years.
But why should so much be settled by eight men in one room?
   Those of us who've doubted the Brady-Darman strategy
aren't confrontationists for the sport of it. A real
political war has the best chance of breaking the political
stalemate at the root of Washington's budget impasse. Sooner
or later the country needs another debate, to be settled by
voters, on just how much taxation and government Americans
want.
   Mr. Darman prefers the Perrier-filled room (no one smokes
anymore) that maximizes his own operating room but obscures
public understanding. And it looks like he's on the verge of
winning. Sequester paranoia is having its desired effect. By
all accounts the summiteers are close to a deal. The White
House has backed down on capital gains to accept indexing for
inflation (on future but apparently not past gains). It hopes
that indexing, plus other still murky "growth incentives,"
will protect its conservative flank.
   It will be fascinating to see if the elected rank-and-file
in Congress go along. House Republicans will need to be
persuaded about capital gains, while liberals will roar if
Social Security is cut (it was still on the table yesterday).
Of course, it is also part of the sitzkrieg strategy that
members won't get very much time to look. And that if they do
vote against it, they will be labeled "irresponsible" for
risking the collapse of government.
   It's a long shot, but the phony budget war might yet
become a real one.
