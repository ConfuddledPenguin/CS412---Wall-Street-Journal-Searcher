   OTTAWA -- Canada's National Energy Board conditionally
approved electricity exports valued at 24 billion Canadian
dollars (US$20.8 billion) by Hydro-Quebec to Vermont and New
York over the next 30 years.
   The board said the exports will be subject to an
environmental review by the federal government of two big
hydroelectric dams, planned by Hydro-Quebec partly to meet
the export requirements.

   The dams are to be built in the James Bay and Hudson Bay
areas of northern Quebec.
   Hydro-Quebec proposed to export 450,000 kilowatts of
electricity to Vermont Joint Owners, a group of nine
utilities in Vermont, over a 30-year period starting Nov. 1.
The provincial government-owned utility also proposed to
export to New York Power Authority one million kilowatts of
electricity from May 1, 1995, to April 30, 2016.
   Jacques Guevremont, a Hydro-Quebec vice president, said
the board's conditions are acceptable and shouldn't be an
obstacle to the exports.
   Several native and environmental groups have opposed the
construction of the dams, because they claim the facilities
will pollute the air and water and destroy the hunting
grounds of the Cree Indians living in the area.
   Hydro-Quebec's electricity exports totaled about C$190
million last year.
