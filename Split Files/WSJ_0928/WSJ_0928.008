   Regarding your Aug. 27 page-one article on Hartmarx and
men's clothing, I wonder how your writer could take such a
skewed approach. According to him, soon I shall be called
upon by men robed in mustard-colored, Italian-cut $1,000
suits. No doubt I'll be so disarmed and distracted that I'll
fail to concentrate on their salesmanship. Enter the dowdy
fellow in an American-made Hartmarx or Brooks Brothers -- the
poor guy; his appearance is so ordinary that he actually
closes the deal with me.
