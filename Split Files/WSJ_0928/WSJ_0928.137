   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, the troubled British apparel
and home-furnishings concern, said it would cut 18% of its
work force and close or sell seven United Kingdom
manufacturing plants in an effort to reduce overcapacity and
shift most of its production to foreign contract
manufacturing plants. Analysts have said the company's recent
slide in earnings, brought on in part by a slump in its U.S.
retail operations, has been exacerbated by high labor costs
in the U.K.
   The factory closings, which will eliminate about 1,000
jobs, will reduce Laura Ashley's in-house manufacturing
output to about 15% of all products, from 55% now, a company
spokesman said. The company also will cut an additional 500
employees from its world-wide retail operations, reducing the
total company work force to 6,600 from 8,100 at present.

   Laura Ashley reported a pretax loss of #4.6 million ($8.6
million) for the year ended Jan. 27, despite an 18% rise in
sales. The company's worsening financial straits prompted
Laura Ashley last month to sell a 15% stake in the company to
Jusco Co., a Japanese chain-store operator.
