   LONDON -- Malaysian financier Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat has
boosted his stake in U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank PLC
to 5.48%, a move that follows a sharp drop in its share price
on talk he had sold his holding.
   Tan Sri Khoo, who was among three prominent international
financiers drafted by Standard Chartered in 1986 to help it
fight off a potential bid by Lloyds Bank PLC, acquired
600,000 shares, Standard Chartered said in a statement to the
London Stock Exchange.

   The acquisition raised his total shareholding to
12,225,000 shares. His previous stake had stood at 5.04% of
the bank's issued share capital.
   A Standard Chartered spokesman added that "we're not aware
of his motives for the purchase."
   U.K. equity dealers saw the acquisition largely as
opportunistic, noting that the bank's share price fell more
than 10% in rumor-driven trading Wednesday. Dealers noted
that unconfirmed rumors had driven the share price down. The
rumors included speculation over future profitability and
dividends and talk that Tan Sri Khoo had sold his stake in
the bank.
