   There's a simple way to describe Washington's current
response to financial weakness in the banking industry:
panic. Fearful that banks may be going the way of the S&amp;Ls,
policymakers are uncritically advancing solutions that will
bring about the result they are hoping to avert.
   In July, several officials called for higher capital
requirements for banks -- a goal that was widely endorsed in
Congress and the press. In August, the FDIC proposed raising
deposit insurance premiums for banks by the maximum allowable
amount -- to almost 20 cents on every $100 of deposits --
again to resounding applause. In September, the Comptroller
General of the United States, in testimony before the Senate
Banking committee, reported that the FDIC's bank insurance
fund was near depletion and recommended that the FDIC be
permitted to raise deposit insurance rates without limit in
order to restore the integrity of the fund. This idea was
endorsed even by the Treasury Department and legislation to
bring it about was passed by the House and introduced in the
Senate by Donald Riegle, the Chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.

   How would banks that are required to raise their capital
be expected to do so? There are basically three ways: sell
shares, retain earnings or sell off assets (and shed
corresponding liabilities). The success of the first two
obviously depends on the ability of management to earn
profits. The sale of shares is heavily disfavored because it
dilutes the ownership of current shareholders -- but it is
unlikely to be a viable option in any case because (as the
S&amp;Ls have discovered) there is no market for the shares of a
depository institution that is only marginally profitable.
   Increasing profitability, on the other hand, means
increasing risk, since the more profitable loans and
investments are those that have the greatest inherent risk.
Selling assets and shedding liabilities is a viable course,
but in practical terms it also means increasing risk because
the market is interested only in buying the banks' least
risky assets. Thus, it is not necessarily true that raising
capital standards for banks will leave them stronger; in
fact, if banks must strive to meet higher capital
requirements they may weaken themselves by increasing the
relative riskiness of their portfolios.
   Then there is the issue of deposit insurance premiums.
Obviously, an increase in these premiums will reduce the
profitability of banks, making it harder for them to increase
capital or to maintain the capital levels they already have.
And although a deposit insurance premium of almost 20 cents
on every $100 of deposits does not sound very large, it is
important to remember that a reasonably well-managed U.S.
bank earns about $1 on every $100 of assets, with money
center banks generally below this level. Since banks fund
about 75% of their assets with deposits, a deposit insurance
premium even at the current level represents about 15% of
pretax earnings and is thus a significant amount. An increase
in this obligation will obviously further reduce the earnings
of banks and cause them -- if they are to remain profitable
-- to take on greater risk even if they don't have to
increase their capital.
   Thus, not only is there a contradiction between higher
deposit insurance premiums and requiring banks to increase
their capital, but both steps -- together and separately --
will weaken the financial condition of banks by causing them
to take on more portfolio risk. Why, then, have both ideas --
together and separately -- been so widely applauded in
Washington?
   The reason seems to be that Washington policymakers have
mistakenly assumed that the best protection for the taxpayers
is the health of the deposit insurance funds. This is
completely wrong. As clearly shown by the S&amp;L debacle, the
best protection for the taxpayers is not the size of the
deposit insurance funds; it is the health of the institutions
these funds insure.
   Once a substantial portion of a whole industry begins to
slip toward insolvency, the deposit insurance funds have no
meaning. The liability of the taxpayers for the S&amp;L
industry's massive losses goes far beyond the size of the
insurance fund that once guaranteed the deposits in S&amp;Ls,
even when the insurance fund was at its healthiest. For this
reason, the current debate about the optimum size of the bank
insurance fund is a sideshow -- except to the extent that the
policies chosen to rescue the fund contribute further to the
weakness of the industry the fund insures.
   To some extent, Washington is confused by its own
rhetoric. Deposit insurance was presented as insurance, in
much the same way and for much the same reason that Social
Security was. But deposit insurance is insurance in name
only. The size of the deposit insurance fund bears no
relationship to the risks it is intended to cover. The
premiums paid by insureds bear no relationship to the risks
they impose on the fund, and are not intended to -- and do
not -- affect the riskiness of their behavior.
   It is important to make this distinction, because if
deposit insurance were in fact insurance then the proper
response to a decline in the size of the deposit insurance
fund would be higher premiums on banks -- since higher
premiums in a true insurance scheme would discourage the
behavior insured against. But deposit insurance premiums are
not insurance premiums; they are a tax on the banking
industry, levied for the privilege of receiving federal
government and ultimately taxpayer backing for certain
liabilities. If there were ever any doubt about this
proposition, it was removed by the S&amp;L bailout, in which the
presence or absence of an insurance fund was largely
irrelevant. Depositors were bailed out by the taxpayers; the
FSLIC fund served at most as a small deduction from the
taxpayers' total bill.
   Looked at in this way, it becomes far less clear that an
increase in deposit insurance premiums is the appropriate
response to a decline in the size of the deposit insurance
fund. Clearly, there is growing financial weakness in the
banking industry. This weakness has already caused a
substantial decline in the size of the deposit insurance fund
administered by the FDIC. The relevant question, however, is
not how to shore up the fund but how to address the banking
industry's weakness. It cannot seriously be contended that
banking or any other industry will be strengthened when
higher taxes are levied on it.
   When Congress was considering the S&amp;L bailout legislation
last year, it was warned that the S&amp;L industry could not
survive increased capital requirements, increased deposit
insurance premiums, reduced investment opportunities and
lower earnings from its investment in the Home Loan Bank
System. Although this would seem fairly obvious to most
people, the purpose of the legislation was not the survival
of the industry but the survival of the legislators. A year
later, we can only hope that policymakers will take a longer
term view.
