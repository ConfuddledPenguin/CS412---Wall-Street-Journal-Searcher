   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s new chairman, Kent Kresa,
tried to dig out from the avalanche of controversy descending
on the defense contractor, saying his mandate is to make the
company's businesses "world class."
   But the chairman's rosy comments to a group of reporters
here came as a letter from the Air Force surfaced blasting
Northrop for "recurring program problems," and a trade
publication said Northrop's Tacit Rainbow missile has failed
a number of recent tests. Consequently, Defense Week reported
in its latest editions, the $3.7 billion program is in
jeopardy of seeing its funding canceled on Capitol Hill.

   The letter, dated June 5, was sent to Mr. Kresa by Jack
Welch Jr., the Air Force acquisition chief. It said a review
of the company's programs disclosed some of them to have
"shown improvement," but "others, including Tacit Rainbow and
key classified programs, continue to reflect poor
performance."
   "Because these problems have been occurring at multiple
Northrop divisions, we are doing an in-depth review . . . to
assess whether root causes are in corporate policies,
procedures and management practices, relevant to all of your
business."
   Calling the problems "most serious," Mr. Welch indicated
he would meet with Mr. Kresa in July to go over the review
and "consider your next steps." A copy of the letter, which
is stamped "Competition Sensitive," was obtained by The Wall
Street Journal.
   Mr. Kresa declined to comment on the specifics of the
letter or the review, which he said has been completed. He
did concede that there were "some suggestions of things we
could do better," and that the company has "a lot of actions
under way" to shore up its military projects.
   Nonetheless, he called the Air Force's overall findings
"very favorable" and said he "had no quarrels with the
report."
   A spokesman for Mr. Welch's office at the Pentagon
declined to comment immediately on either the letter or the
review. But an investigator for Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.), who is planning to hold follow-up congressional
hearings soon into Northrop's contracting activities, said he
has been briefed on the review and termed it "devastating."
Told that Mr. Kresa had said its conclusions were generally
favorable, he added: "That's diametrically opposed to what I
understand."
   As for Tacit Rainbow, Defense Week reported that the
missile recently failed to hit its target for the ninth time
in 15 test flights, and the program is at least three years
behind schedule. The Air Force yesterday confirmed those test
results and said it was now conducting "a thorough
engineering review" to get to the bottom of the trouble.
   Mr. Kresa played down the problems with the weapon, which
is designed to be launched by a B-52 bomber and then loiter
in the air before zeroing in on an enemy's radar. "We're
trying to do a very sophisticated job at a very low cost," he
said.
   Mr. Kresa, who has been Northrop's chief executive officer
since January and president since 1987, was named chairman
last week, when Thomas V. Jones announced he was stepping
down. Mr. Jones's departure was clouded, however, by an
international arbitrator's ruling that Northrop tried to
bribe South Korean officials to buy the company's F-20
fighter planes.
   Northrop also has been excoriated on Capitol Hill lately,
with the Government Operations and the Energy and Commerce
committees of the House holding hearings to attack Northrop's
work on the MX missile, B-2 Stealth bomber, AV-8B Harrier jet
and air-launched cruise missile.
   Both panels also are planning for more hearings and have
pledged to subpoena Northrop officials to testify, if need
be. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal
justice announced that it would focus on Northrop's conduct
while holding a hearing next month on the Pentagon's
debarment process.
   Mr. Kresa said that, although he anticipates "adversarial"
proceedings with Congress, he would gladly appear provided
that he was given ample time to prepare. "We don't want to
face a hearing where we don't know what's going on," he said,
explaining why Northrop executives had declined to show up at
the most recent round of hearings.
   He contended that Northrop mainly will have to answer to
"problems the company has already addressed . . . a long time
ago," adding that it has taken a number of steps to "operate
the entire business at the highest ethical level we can."
   "First we have to gain the confidence of our customer,"
the Defense Department, Mr. Kresa acknowledged, "and then the
confidence of Congress."
