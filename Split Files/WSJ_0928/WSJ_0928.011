   Lee Liberman, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a written statement that Mr. Novatny's resignation was
unexpected.
   "I had intended to recommend his promotion to chief
executive officer of the company at our annual meeting next
January. However, he told me he had decided after much
thought that he simply did not want the responsibilities and
pressures" associated with that job, Mr. Liberman said.
   A Laclede spokesman said that Mr. Novatny was unavailable
to comment on his resignation.
