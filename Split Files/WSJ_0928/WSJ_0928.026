   WASHINGTON -- Continued real estate lending woes have
moved the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to increase loss
projections for its bank insurance fund this year to $3
billion from the $2 billion it was predicting earlier this
month.
   The forecast was the latest in a flurry of gloomy
assessments about the decline in the health of the nation's
banks. While failures on the scale of the savings and loan
mess aren't expected, the news has been sour enough to push
Congress, regulatory agencies and the Bush administration to
plow ahead with plans to reform the nation's deposit
insurance system and restructure the industry.

   "These reports create a healthy sense of alarm," said
Robert Litan, a banking expert with the Brookings Institution
who said the sense of urgency also has prompted legislators
and lobbyists to show greater flexibility as reform proposals
move through Congress.
   "There has been a remarkable degree of consensus in some
areas," he said. All the pending proposals would, to some
degree, shift risk from the insurance fund to depositors and
the banks.
   Even before the new loss forecasts were announced, the
FDIC planned to raise insurance premiums that banks pay to
19.5 cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100.
Yesterday, the agency approved that regulation, proposed one
month ago; the increase will take effect in January.
   The FDIC loss projection was based on worse-than-expected
financial results for the first half of the year for the
banking industry and the fund. While the FDIC originally
predicted a fund loss of $2 billion for the entire year, it
reported yesterday that the fund posted losses of $1.8
billion in the first half alone. In all of 1989, its losses
totalled $851 million.
   If the insurance fund falls by the $3 billion now
projected, the fund will close the year at about $10 billion,
compared with $18 billion only two years ago. The fund will
drop to a level equal to just 0.5% of insured deposits, its
thinnest margin ever.
   The new projection assumes the failure of 35 unidentified
banks and savings banks that were cited by the General
Accounting Office in its recent assessment of the bank fund,
according to FDIC Chairman William Seidman. The FDIC
previously had assumed that some of these institutions would
collapse, and in fact, 15 already have been closed. All of
the institutions have, or had, more than $100 million in
assets.
   Failure of all 35 of the institutions could add $2 billion
in net cost to the fund. Reserving for those possible
failures is the most conservative course to follow, Mr.
Seidman said, but it's too soon to know what final losses
will be. "The estimate we made may well be wrong again," he
warned. "It may even be too high."
   Indeed, most analysts remain relatively sanguine about the
fund, even if they are more pessimistic about the industry.
"As far as insuring the broad base of the country's banks,
the numbers still work," said Alex Sheshunoff, who closely
tracks financial industry data for Sheshunoff Information
Services Inc., in San Antonio, Texas.
   The House has passed legislation that would give the FDIC
authority to raise insurance premiums as necessary. The
Senate may take up a version of the bill today. Mr. Seidman
said yesterday that the FDIC would consider increasing
assessments again if Congress grants the authority. "But I
don't think we can fix the fund solely by raising premiums,"
he added.
   Various congressional committees continue to hold hearings
on a variety of proposals to restructure the banking system,
but no action is likely until after Jan. 1, when the Bush
administration is expected to unveil a proposal of its own.
   With the savings and loan disaster fresh in mind, every
pending proposal calls for closer supervision of banks and
thrifts, early intervention by regulators -- possibly in the
form of restricting dividends -- if bank capital slips, and
controls to discourage financial institutions away from
taking large risks with insured deposits. In addition, there
are proposals to reduce insurance coverage for pension funds
and other big depositors.
   But regulators worry that Congress will push through
proposals that would inject new instability into the
already-rattled industry. "The last thing we need are
political or private interests masquerading as public
policy," warned Robert Clarke, comptroller of the currency.
