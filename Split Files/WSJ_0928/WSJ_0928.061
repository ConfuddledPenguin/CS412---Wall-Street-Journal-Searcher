   TOKYO -- "America-handling" has been Toshiki Kaifu's
strong point during his 13 months as prime minister. But
today he arrives in New York for a four-day visit that will
test that ability. It could make his subsequent six-day trip
to the tense Middle East seem like rest and relaxation.
   The irritants to U.S.-Japan relations that Mr. Kaifu faces
go beyond the usual trade squabbles. While Mr. Kaifu has
developed a strong relationship with President Bush, with
whom he will meet tomorrow, the real challenge for him will
be to use speech, news conference and interview opportunities
to assuage U.S. public opinion.

   Japan's delay in contributing to the Gulf crisis still
upsets some Americans, even though Japan has agreed to give
$4 billion. Talk of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. taking
over entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. is exacerbating
fears by some that Japan is buying up the U.S.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's slur against U.S.
blacks, the latest by Japanese politicians in recent years,
raises anew the issues of Japan's alleged racism and
arrogance. And if all that weren't enough, another trade
squabble -- this one over Japan's ban on imported rice -- is
building.
   Mr. Kaifu will bring with him a new proposal on
agricultural trade. But analysts say it will be minimal and
isn't likely to satisfy U.S. demands.
   He also will lay out for U.S. officials the outlines of
legislation that would allow Japan to dispatch personnel for
strictly non-military duties in such emergencies as the Gulf
crisis, within the framework of United Nations peacekeeping
resolutions. But the "general view" is that "it will be a
matter of months" before the outlined legislation is
implemented, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe.
   Under the proposed legislation, members of Japan's Self
Defense Forces who are sent overseas would be under civilian
control, would serve only in non-combat roles such as
communications, transportation and medical support, and would
have to adhere to Japan's war-renouncing Constitution.
   Mr. Kaifu needs a diplomatic triumph. He gets high ratings
from the Japanese public, but his many enemies among fellow
Liberal Democratic Party politicians have picked up their
sniping, especially at his seemingly passive management of
Japan's response to the Gulf crisis.
   Mr. Kaifu's close ties with Mr. Bush, one of the sources
of his popularity, have to some extent turned into a
liability. There are titillating references in popular
magazines to Mr. Kaifu's "Bush phone," a play on the Japanese
word for a push-button phone that implies he makes no move
without consulting the president.
   "He's probably saying, `Yes sir, yes sir, yes George,' "
speculates one bureaucrat. "This is a leader-less country,
but now it looks especially leader-less."
   Foreign Ministry officials accompanying Mr. Kaifu to the
U.S. are sensitive to these charges and worry that Americans
may be getting the impression that Japan only acts under
pressure. This impression may have been fed, they fear, when
a $3 billion addition to Japan's initial contribution to the
Gulf was announced the day after the U.S. House of
Representatives demanded Japanese action.
   "The prime minister has the important task to make the
American people understand that this is really Japan's own
decision, that Japan is doing it for herself," a Foreign
Ministry official says. He argues that Japan can act without
U.S. pressure, but has so little experience responding to
security problems that it took time to debate questions
arising from Japan's Constitution, which renounces the use of
force in international relations, except for Self-defense.
   "We responded to the crisis with unusually fast speed {for
Japan}, but the level of expectation of the international
community for Japan with its size was way beyond our actual
capability, so frustration began to stir up {overseas}," the
official says.
   The U.S. has been hoping that Japan would help lead this
year's round of multilateral trade talks to a successful
conclusion by agreeing to ease its ban on rice imports.
Agricultural issues are a key element in the negotiations,
which enter their final stage next month. And a Japanese
concession on the politically sensitive rice issue would
increase pressure on the European Community to lower its
controversial farm subsidies.
   But it doesn't look like Mr. Kaifu will be able to please
Mr. Bush on this score. While some prominent Japanese
bureaucrats and politicians have recently argued for
liberalizing the rice market, government officials outlined a
proposal that calls for only a 30% decrease, over 10 years,
in overall agricultural subsidies from their high 1986
levels. The proposal, which is much closer to the EC position
than that of U.S., doesn't address the ban on rice imports.
   Mr. Kaifu leaves New York Monday evening for six days in
Cairo, Amman, Ankara, Jidda and Muscat. The goodwill trip,
scheduled before Iraq's attack on Kuwait, had been planned
for late August, but was postponed because Japan hadn't come
up with its Gulf contribution. Mr. Kaifu is expected to
emphasize Japan's solidarity with the anti-Iraq forces and to
explain the nature of Japan's contributions to the area.
