   NEW YORK -- In another blow to Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc., Thomas
McElligott quit yesterday as executive vice president and
executive creative director to open his own advertising
agency in Minneapolis.
   Mr. McElligott, a highly regarded but eccentric creative
executive who cofounded Minneapolis's Fallon McElligott
agency, was brought in to Chiat just nine months ago to
oversee creative work in the New York office, as well as its
offices in Toronto and London. Chiat's headquarters are in
Venice, Calif.

   His departure comes at a difficult time for the agency,
which is defending the $30 million to $35 million Royal
Caribbean Cruise Line Inc. account. That account is under
review, and Chiat has pulled out all the stops to save the
business. In an unusual move the agency offered up Mr.
McElligott to personally act as the top creative executive on
the account.
   Mr. McElligott couldn't be reached yesterday. In a
statement, he didn't discuss his reasons for leaving, but
said he felt it was a good time to start his own agency. And
in an interview yesterday, Jay Chiat, chairman and chief
executive officer, said Mr. McElligott told him that he
wanted to live in Minneapolis once again and run his own
shop.
   "He had pretty much made up his mind to start an agency
and he was getting somewhat concerned about getting more and
more deeply involved here," Mr. Chiat said.
   Mr. McElligott did help to bring in a couple of clients to
Chiat's Toronto operations, but he failed in his bid to win
the $13 million Haagen-Dazs account for the New York office,
which earlier this week was awarded to BBDO, the only other
competitor. Meanwhile, the shop lost many accounts and fired
numerous staffers.
   Mr. McElligott, 47 years old, will now be chairman and
creative director of a new agency, called McElligott Wright
Morrison White. Two partners, Tony Wright, 30, and Rob White,
34, are currently executives at Chiat. John Morrison, 38,
currently works at Carmichael Lynch, a Minneapolis agency.
   "We simply are going to make very smart ads . . . and we
hope to make them for very smart advertisers," said Mr.
Morrison, who said the new shop will open Nov. 1. He said he
and his partners want the agency, although based in
Minneapolis, to become regarded as a national agency. "We
will go where the work is," he said.
   Mr. Morrison said the agency doesn't yet have any clients.
   Mr. Chiat said Mr. McElligott won't be replaced, but that
Lee Clow, the shop's president who shared the executive
creative director title with Mr. McElligott, will hold that
position alone.
   Mr. Chiat said he will now devote even more time to the
New York operations, having recently been spending most of
his time building a European network. "I plan to be much more
active in the agency's operations," he said. "We've just got
to get some new business in here."
