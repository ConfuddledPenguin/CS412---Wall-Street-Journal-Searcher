   PARIS -- The Gulf crisis has knocked Euro-optimism for a
loop, and the staggering may continue for some time.
   The jump in oil prices, a looming U.S. recession, and
continuing worry about the costs and effects of German
unification all mean that Europe, especially Eastern Europe,
"is passing through the tunnel at the end of the light," says
Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies at King's College
in London. He warns that a deep global recession could derail
East European and Soviet reforms, perhaps "leading to chaos,
social explosions and large migrations of people."

   The immediate economic consequences of higher oil prices
are much greater in the East than in the West. Most East
European countries already face a major problem, knowing they
would have to start paying the world price, in dollars, for
Soviet oil by the end of the year. The doubling of world oil
prices only worsens their plight. "We don't see prosperity
anywhere on the horizon," says Bronislaw Geremek, a leader of
the Polish parliament. For Western Europe, economists have
trimmed as much as one percentage point off growth
expectations, but that still leaves West Europe growing by 2%
or more next year. Only in Britain, struggling with 10%
inflation, is a recession likely.
   More worrying, uncertainties over the Gulf crisis and its
long-term effects on the world economy have widened cracks in
European Community unity that had seemed to be narrowing.
Several EC countries are now expressing reservations about
the details and timing of establishing a single European
currency managed by a Europewide system of central banks,
although only Britain remains opposed to the end goals.
Doubts on the currency union expressed by Bundesbank
President KarlOtto Poehl and German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel have particularly irritated the French and the
Brussels EC bureaucracy. EC Commission President Jacques
Delors this week chided the Germans, asking "What do the
Germans want? Frankly, I often ask myself." Mr. Delors is
also miffed at the Spanish, who until recently have been big
EC unity backers.
   Meanwhile, the tardy, timid and fractured response of EC
countries to U.S. calls for money and men to aid the
anti-Iraq military buildup has demonstrated, to the
embarrassment of many here, that political unity is a long
way off. Most decisions about the Gulf continue to come from
national capitals, not Brussels. The French dispatched
thousands of soldiers to Saudi Arabia only after Iraqi
soldiers raided their embassy in Kuwait.
   "The Gulf shows us clearly that Eurocentrism is very
fragile," says Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French
Institute for International Relations. "The reality is that
the world remains dominated by military power," not economic
cohesion.
   But dogged optimists say the Gulf crisis illustrates the
urgency of greater, not less, European unity. "Only a sense
of cohesion and solidarity can protect Europeans from
large-scale external shocks," says Catherine Lalumiere,
secretary-general of the 23-nation Council of Europe. Europe
"has been drawn along by the U.S. in the Gulf crisis," says
Roger Fauroux, the French minister of industry. "If we want
to exist in future conflicts, and not have the Americans run
our affairs, we need rapid economic and monetary union, and
then political union."
   Indeed, with a summit meeting of the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as the
Helsinki process) scheduled for November, and two EC
treaty-writing conferences on economic and political unity
slated for December, momentum toward a more-united Europe
should be rekindled. "The machinery is there to give the
process its final push," says Gianni de Michelis, Italy's
foreign minister. "We're all going to need to make the tough
decisions on unity next year, because of the deadlines set by
these conferences," adds Elisabeth Guigou, who handles
European cooperation matters for French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   But the Gulf hangover persists. "It would be a tragedy if
the dramatic events in the Gulf obscured or halted the
incredible events that are leading to a united Europe," says
Robert Badinter, president of the French equivalent of the
U.S. Supreme Court. "And it would be criminal for the EC to
miss the chance to help Eastern Europe, for example, just
because of financial reasons. The end result would be worse
for everybody than before the Berlin Wall came down."
