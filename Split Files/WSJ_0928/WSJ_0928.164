   SAN FRANCISCO -- Striking a blow to advocates of
voter-mandated insurance-rate cuts, a federal court here
declared unconstitutional a Nevada law requiring sweeping
auto-insurance rate roll backs.
   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Nevada
law denied insurers a constitutionally guaranteed "fair and
reasonable return." The Nevada reform package, passed in 1989
to mirror California's similar Proposition 103, called for
insurers to cut auto liability insurance rates to a minimum
of 15% below 1988 levels and to freeze rates for a year.

   Seven insurance companies challenged the law, maintaining
that it violated their due process rights because it
prohibited their increasing rates if they faced losses.
Nevada's new restrictions, which were to have taken effect
Oct. 1, 1989, weren't enforced because the court imposed
stays while legal challenges were pending.
   Nevada's law states "rates are inadequate if they are
clearly insufficient, together with the income from
investments attributable to them, to sustain projected losses
and expenses in the class of business to which they apply."
   The federal court yesterday ruled that the definition left
insurers in the position of declaring rates adequate if
losses and expenses were identical.
