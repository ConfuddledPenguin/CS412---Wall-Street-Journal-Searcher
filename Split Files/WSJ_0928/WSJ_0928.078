   GEORGETOWN, Texas -- Sitting quietly in thin vials in Don
Lively's dusty barn here, guarded by two growling dogs, is
something you can't buy anywhere else in America. It is pure
Japanese bull semen.
   Mr. Lively's store of the stuff is worth $2 million. No
bull.

   Semen is all that remains of four bulls spirited out of
Japan 14 years ago. Their names were Judo, Mazda, Fuji and
Ryusho, and they are believed to have been the only cattle of
the Wagyu breed ever to leave Japan.
   The bulls died natural deaths after 12 years in the U.S.,
but in the meantime they left behind enough semen for
thousands of progeny.
   American cattlemen used to consider the Wagyu breed puny
and pitifully ugly. Then, in 1988, Japan agreed to end quotas
by 1991 that have stifled imports of beef from America.
   Suddenly, Wagyus looked a lot prettier to U.S. ranchers,
who saw a way to horn in on a market.
   The Japanese have a special love for Wagyu meat, often
called Kobe Beef in the U.S. They say the way fat is marbled
into the meat produces a divine taste, buttery texture and
perfect appearance. They pay up to $180 a pound for it, and
the idea of capturing even a small slice of this has kindled
acute interest in American Wagyu.
   Mr. Lively's liquid assets have become immensely valuable.
Ranchers from Idaho to Australia looking for a stake in the
market have begun draining his semen stockpile, paying $250 a
vial -- enough to impregnate one cow. Even though that's
about 10 times the cost of normal high-grade semen, Mr.
Lively has sold $1 million worth already.
   Not only that, but some also pay up to $25,000 each for
Mr. Lively's nearly full-blooded Wagyu bulls, which he
created by inbreeding generations of cattle with Japanese
semen.
   Under normal circumstances, ranchers simply would import
Wagyus from Japan to populate their feed lots. But
circumstances aren't normal with Japan. While Japanese
farmers freely import cattle, they won't let Wagyus out.
   Japanese cattlemen say Wagyus and their seed are national
treasures. Exporting them, they say, would be like smuggling
out defense secrets. The informal export ban is enforced by
pressure from powerful farm cooperatives.
   Japanese cattlemen "think that if they export Wagyu semen
they may be immediately menaced by wide-scale reproduction in
the U.S.," says livestock professor Shozo Watanabe of
Kagoshima University.
   They may have a point. Today, the four exported bulls'
genetic pool -- semen and hundreds of mixed-blood Wagyu
cattle -- gives U.S. ranchers a rare opportunity to take a
lesson from Japan's industrial success: reverse engineering.
   U.S. breeders have raised cattle that are as much as
63/64ths Wagyu (more than the 15/16ths is considered
purebred). Because of a shortage of Wagyu cows, Texas A&amp;M
University is even cloning them, implanting identical embryos
in non-Wagyu cows.
   "We can reverse-engineer this and end up better than
them," says Robert Rebholtz, president of Agri Beef Co. of
Boise, Idaho, who is crossing Wagyus with black Angus cattle.
   Agri Beef, like most U.S. producers, plans to make the
beef both for export to Japan and for the U.S. Producers say
it not only tastes better, but is lower in the kind of fats
that raise cholesterol levels. (It will also be more
expensive. One reason: Wagyu beef are fed less each day for a
much longer period than U.S. cattle, which are fed huge
amounts quickly so they can be fattened up and processed in a
hurry.)
   The circumstances of the bulls' exodus from Japan are
still a dark mystery and discussion of their departure is
still like waving a red flag to the Japanese. The bulls
"shouldn't have been let out," says Umeo Oikawa, a Wagyu
raiser in northern Japan. "Those cattle weren't any one
person's property. They were raised through the efforts of
Japanese farmers over thousands of years."
   And indeed, for a long time the bulls seemed to carry a
Tut-like curse.
   In 1975, Texas cattleman Morris Whitney heard of Wagyu
meat from friends in the military and decided that Americans
were ready for Kobe Beef. He linked up with a mysterious
Japanese businessman who somehow got the bulls onto a plane
to New Jersey faster than the Japanese could say, "Where's
the beef?"
   Then partnerships collapsed, deals soured, the Japanese
businessman disappeared and Mr. Whitney ended up with four
bulls on his farm, some set loose among the cacti on the open
range.
   While his bulls dined on prickly pear, Mr. Whitney courted
stores such as Neiman Marcus, which he hoped would sell his
Wagyu beef in high-priced gift boxes much as Japanese stores
do.
   But there weren't any bites from stores or other ranchers,
who didn't care to raise the homely beast. A Wagyu is
everything an American rancher disdains, what with its dainty
bones, thin-skinned torso and narrow, pointed rump that makes
it look swaybacked.
   Ranchers, who are fond of macho cattle, complain that
Wagyus are nervous, hyperactive animals that irritatingly
walk with tiny little mincing steps.
   The bulls survived the open range, but for Mr. Whitney,
the years were lean. After sinking $300,000 into breeding the
cattle, he sold out to a partner for $6,500 and went into the
real estate business. "I was ahead of my time," he sighs.
   The buyer, a veterinarian named Dennis Wendt, apparently
had big dreams of becoming king of the Wagyu business.
Drawing in friends and relatives as investors with what could
be called a tender offer, he mimicked the legendary nurturing
of the Japanese, who have sometimes attributed their beef's
marbling to beer feedings and individual massage sessions,
although those methods are not actually practiced widely in
Japan.
   Mr. Wendt rubbed down his cattle and trucked in 6,000
cases of beer, popping open cans into troughs.
   The main effect? "Just what you'd expect," says Mr. Wendt,
"Drunk, lazy cattle."
   The bovine bacchanalia didn't create any better meat, and
the venture folded in bitterness in 1983. The assets were
carved up among partners. Some got cattle. Others got nearly
worthless semen.
   That any survived may be a minor miracle. Last year, Mr.
Lively says, a large-scale rancher visiting his LoDo Ranch
confessed that he unknowingly dumped out 6,000 units of Wagyu
semen, worth about $1.5 million at Mr. Lively's prices.
   Mr. Lively ended up with the four bulls on LoDo Ranch
after his partner sued Mr. Wendt's venture. For years, his
rancher friends ribbed him for raising his "uglies." Mr.
Lively, a 62-year-old retired stone carver, had little to do
but quietly breed his herd. "They all thought I was crazy,"
he says. "All I had was these stinking cows. And they weren't
even pretty."
   He is clearly getting the last laugh now because anyone
who wants the prime semen has no other choice. The stuff is
expensive, says Jerry Reeves, a Washington State University
professor who buys it for the Wagyu cattle the school breeds,
"but he's the only choice we've got."
   Moreover, Japanese companies are aggressively buying U.S.
ranches and are eager to stock them with Wagyus. Mr. Lively,
who keeps a Japanese flag on a crooked flagpole near his
barn, has sold animals to a U.S. unit of Japan's big Itoham
Foods Inc.
   Executives of Toyota's trading subsidiary visited LoDo
Ranch this year with a mind to buying most of the operation.
The deal collapsed after Toyota balked at the price -- which
Mr. Lively won't reveal -- but Mr. Lively says they'll be
back after they chew it over.
   Japan's ranchers contend that U.S. Wagyu meat isn't the
real thing, but the big test will come next January: That's
when Texas A&amp;M plans to ship beef from 10 of its Wagyus to
Japan for blind taste tests. A&amp;M officials aren't predicting
the outcome of the head-to-head competition, but they're sure
they won't be slaughtered.
