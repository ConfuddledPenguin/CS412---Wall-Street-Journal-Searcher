   The International Energy Agency will urge its members at a
meeting in Paris today to be ready to dip into oil
stockpiles, but it won't call for a coordinated release of
emergency supplies at this time.
   Officials of the IEA, made up of 21 major oil consuming
nations, still don't see any real evidence of oil shortages,
and as a result are unlikely to recommend the group initiate
its standing emergency oil-sharing mechanism. The IEA
governing board is meeting to review the world oil-supply
picture in the wake of disruptions caused by the Middle East
crisis. The meeting will be its third since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   "We are not pulling the trigger," George Quincy Lumsden
Jr., the IEA's director of oil market developments, said in
an interview.
   Nor is it likely members of the group will act
individually to follow the U.S. in releasing oil from
emergency storage to try to hold down runaway prices.
Government officials of both Germany and Japan said, in fact,
they had no such plans.
   Oil prices resumed their run-up, meanwhile, after falling
briefly in the wake of President Bush's announcement that the
U.S. will withdraw five million barrels as a "test" of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The U.S. futures price of
November crude reached a record $40.10 a barrel, before
settling at $39.54, up 87 cents.
   Oil prices softened $1 a barrel as European and Asian
markets opened yesterday on the basis of the scheduled
drawdown from the U.S. reserve. But after traders focused on
the token size of the withdrawalless than 10% of the world's
oil needs for one day -- and new rumors of a Middle East war,
prices turned up again.
   The turnabout dashed hopes of a rally in the U.S. stock
market, and helped drive down stock and bond prices. On the
International Petroleum Exchange in London, Brent crude for
November delivery settled 60 cents higher at $38.55 a barrel,
after being as low as $36.40. On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the surge in crude pushed October heating oil above
$1.04 a gallon, up 1.8 cents. October gasoline closed 2.59
cents a gallon higher at nearly $1.03.
   In testimony before a House Energy subcommittee, U.S.
Energy Secretary James Watkins tried to damp expectations
that the SPR test would lower oil prices. He said that the
"psychological impact" of the test is significant, but "we're
not going into the test with the idea that oil prices will go
down $8 a barrel."
   Mr. Watkins explained that there is a danger in implying
to the public that prices will drop after a test drawdown,
because they might not fall. "If Saddam Hussein makes another
threat, the market would shoot up again," he said. The oil
reserve "is not the only thing affecting the marketplace."
   But he said the test "shows we're serious," and he
characterized it as a "first step" toward possible broader
use, if the situation warrants.
   Several lawmakers urged Mr. Watkins to push U.S. allies to
tap their reserves, too.
   But IEA officials were told yesterday by the U.S.
government that the step it was taking "does not signify any
decision to draw down the SPR." Such a decision, IEA
officials were told in a communication from Washington, would
be made only in coordination with other nations in the group.
   "This test is a unilateral action to ensure the SPR system
is operational," the U.S. message to the IEA said. It added
that the U.S. isn't seeking similar tests by other countries
with strategic oil reserves.
   Government oil in storage in consuming nations totals
about one billion barrels, with the bulk -- 590 million
barrels -- in the U.S. facility. Japan and Germany share most
of the remainder. Other nations of the IEA require oil
companies that are selling fuels within their borders to
maintain certain levels of commercial inventories, which
serve as their national reserves.
   IEA officials said the governing board could recommend
that other countries test their systems. At the very least,
the officials said, the member-nations will be urged to go
through final preparations to make sure they could quickly
release oil from stockpiles, if actual shortages do develop.
   Also, IEA officials said other steps may be recommended,
including government calls to oil companies to buy less oil
and use up some excess inventories. Member countries likely
will be encouraged to intensify energy conservation as well.
   In the oil industry, it's generally expected that the IEA
will conclude today's meeting by issuing a statement similar
to previous ones. It would state that supplies currently are
adequate and that drawdowns of strategic inventories aren't
necessary at this time. "Nonetheless, for the first time, the
IEA might begin to warm to the idea that measures could
eventually be used to address price movements," reported
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
   An IEA official appeared to agree. "All the tools we've
got are written on a supply basis," he said. "Nevertheless,
the price problem is a supply problem, if the market never
lies."
