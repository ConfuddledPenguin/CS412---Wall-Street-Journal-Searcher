   Oxford, England -- This pleasant university town has
always relished its visits from American notables. The big
noise last academic year was Stephen Sondheim's stint as the
brand-new professor of drama. Just before the beginning of
the university term this autumn, Oxford had a visit from
Julia Child.
   America's best-known television cook was here to attend
what may well have been the 10th Oxford Symposium on Food.
(There is a question as to whether to count the first meeting
in 1979, as it was not open to the public.) The symposiums --
organized by Alan Davidson, a former British ambassador to
Laos who is now writing the several-million-word "Oxford
Companion to Food," and Theodore Zeldin, the eminent
historian of France and star of French television -- have
been copied and emulated all over the globe, from Turkey to
Norway and from Sydney to Boston.

   Eccentricity is the hallmark of the Oxford meeting. Past
symposiasts have been treated to a lecture in which an
archaeologist claimed to have found the first loaf of bread
ever baked; to a taste of the soup Count Rumford invented to
feed the obstreperous professional beggars of Bavaria whose
demands were undermining the social order; to accounts of
cannibalism replete with tasting notes on the flesh of
different races; and to learned disquisitions on the origins
of cooking vessels, table manners, food taboos, nutritional
fads and farming practices. The participants take an especial
delight in apparent pedantry; for the most specific, arcanely
titled, off-the-wall papers almost always turn out to be the
most exciting and interesting.
   Connoisseurs remember the paper delivered by Charles
Perry, once a rock-music journalist, on medieval Persian
rotted condiments, which were lethal to consume. Mr. Perry
appeared again this year, but his learned and literate
disquisition on "Elements of Arab Feasting," though not
disappointing, lacked the night-of-the-living-dead luridness
of his classic performances.
   "Feasting and Fasting" was the theme of this year's
meeting, and, true to form, contributions on "The Way the
Contemporary Western Assyrians Take Food in the Middle East
During Fasts and Church Holidays" and "Fasting and Feasting
among Oregon's Russian Old Believers" were among the most
stirring. Mrs. Child (who had begun her first visit to the
Oxford Symposium with a dinner at Oxfordshire's best
restaurant, Raymond Blanc's Manoir aux Quat' Saisons) seemed
particularly amused by the paper on "The Black or Hell
Banquet," presented by Phyllis P. Bober of Bryn Mawr College.
   But the great event for Mrs. Child, as for everyone else
who attended the session, was the very last paper, "The
Bayeux Tapestry Sish-Kebab Mystery," by Robert Chenciner, an
associate member of St. Antony's College, the perennial site
of the symposium. Mr. Chenciner, by profession a financial
consultant, also is an art historian specializing in carpets
and ancient textiles. His interest in food is purely
avocational.
   He set himself the subject of examining the panel in the
Bayeux Tapestry (actually "a wool embroidery on fine linen
tabby," which is a fabric in plain weave) -- depicting an
11th-century Norman feast. Mr. Chenciner was at first
intrigued by the fact that "one of the cooks is looking after
shish kebabs of meat cubes and small fowl, spread out like a
spring chicken, being grilled over a box-shaped container
with three shelves and rings protruding on each side of the
top supported by a low (about eight-inch) tripod over a
fire."
   This barbecue was Mr. Chenciner's first puzzle. How had
kebabs traveled from the Near East to Norman France and
England? As other symposium participants quickly pointed out
(and as Mr. Chenciner was clearly aware), the kebabs were a
red herring. Since cooking bits of meat on a stick over an
open fire was almost certainly the chief culinary standby of
primitive man, one cannot assume that, because the technique
is at present associated with the Middle East, it must have
originated there.
   Indeed, as Mr. Chenciner made clear, the kebabs soon
became merely an excuse for discussing the embroidery itself
in front of a conclave of gastronomes. By a series of elegant
arguments, he prepared his audience for the bombshell he then
dropped. Everyone who has ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry has
remarked on how fresh, even new, it looks, and on its good
state of repair.
   The reason for this, Mr. Chenciner argued cogently, is
that it is a modern copy, probably made in the early 18th
century about 1710, and possibly incorporating the original
tapestry. There is no outline drawing in the Bayeux Tapestry,
"just pricked through holes,"Mr. Chenciner points out, "a
usual method of copying, though not necessarily of designing
embroidery." This led him to speculate that the original
might have been mounted onto the linen backing and used as a
template for the copy.
   Despite the lack of slide-projection equipment (as well as
amplification, which caused Mrs. Child, a daughter of
Southern California, to remark that the "production values"
of the symposium could have been higher), Mr. Chenciner's
remarks achieved the dramatic effect intended, and the
audience was electrified.
   It was duly noted that the authorities have thus far
refused to allow the Bayeux Tapestry to be carbon-dated, a
fact that seemed outrageous to veteran symposiast Nicholas
Kurti, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford.
   After it was all over, I asked Mrs. Child -- who had been
a guest of honor at the symposium, and who had made a brief
and charming speech at the Saturday-night dinner that
featured English food (with a main course of boiled mutton)
-- if she had enjoyed the proceedings. "I have never," she
replied in her familiar, slightly breathless voice,
"experienced a conference quite like this." Lest this be open
to misinterpretation, she immediately added, "and I am
definitely coming back next year."
