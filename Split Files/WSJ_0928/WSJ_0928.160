   TORONTO -- Canadian Express Ltd. said Hees International
Bancorp, a merchant banking concern controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, and the Toronto Stock Exchange agreed to
extend to Oct. 18 the deadline on Hees's bid to acquire as
many as 40 million Canadian Express shares for as much as 26
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$22.5 million).
   The offer of 65 Canadian cents (56 U.S. cents) a share was
to be made next Wednesday. The bid would raise Hees's voting
stake in the Toronto banking company to about 56% from 40%.
Canadian Express said it asked for the extension to allow
time for the completion of a fairness opinion.
