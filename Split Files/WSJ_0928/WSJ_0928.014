   SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government is
 making a significant shift in its position on travel to
 North Korea, in an effort to introduce subtle pressure
 within the country for change.
                                                                                                       

   Seoul is turning to the millions of Koreans, by birth or
 heritage, who live overseas, sending signals that it no
 longer opposes visits to the communist North. Because most
 overseas Koreans speak the country's language, they are more
 apt to have contact with ordinary North Koreans when they
 visit, Seoul reasons. And the more North Koreans learn about
 the world, the greater the chance they will pressure their
 government for change, as Eastern Europeans did.
                                                                                                       

   "There are many ways to induce change into North Korea,"
 says Choi Chang Yoon, a senior secretary to President Roh
 Tae Woo. "Our efforts to have direct contacts is just one
 way."
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Choi says that when the new policy becomes known, "We
 expect there will be an overseas rush." But no one expects
 overnight change in North Korea. "Unification is a long-term
 project," he says.
                                                                                                       

   The North Korean government discourages contacts between
 its people and South Korean citizens, despite high-level
 government talks this month. The only contact between
 ordinary citizens occurred back in 1985 for a few separated
 families. Pyongyang doesn't even allow newspapers, mail or
 media contact between the two countries.
                                                                                                       

   In the past, South Korea has made it difficult for
 overseas Koreans, especially those in the U.S., to travel to

 traveler would be forbidden future entry to South Korea,
 harassment of a traveler's family in South Korea, or even
 surveillance in the traveler's home country. Government
 officials admit such tactics were once used but say they
 have since been abandoned.
                                                                                                       

   But that message hasn't gotten through to
 Korean-Americans: They have listened for so long to
 propaganda that they would be kidnapped or murdered in North
 Korea that many still won't consider traveling there. "The
 South Korean government doesn't want people to go there,"
 says Marsha Choon Ja Kim, who runs the AllGold Travel &amp;
 Tours agency in Los Angeles. And under U.S. laws, she says,
 North Korea is off-limits.
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Kim says contact is made difficult because the U.S.
 prevents phone calls, telexes and telegrams to North Korea.
 Indeed, the State Department still has a stern warning in
 effect against travel to North Korea. Still, she says, "More
 and more people want to go there." She can't directly
 arrange a trip because of U.S. regulations, but steers
 clients to agents overseas who can.
                                                                                                       

   The North Koreans are likely to be enthusiastic about an
 increase in visitors because of the hard currency entering
 the country. (South Koreans could provide hard cash, too,
 but their visits carry political implications that make the
 North Korean government uncomfortable.)
                                                                                                       

   About 20,000 people visit North Korea each year, as many
 as half of them from the East bloc. Pyongyang is building
 hotels and encouraging tourism, but is reluctant to grant
 visas to Americans who aren't of Korean extraction, travel
 agents say.
                                                                                                       

   South Korea estimates that 1.2 million Koreans live in
 the U.S. and 670,000 in Japan (Koreans in Japan who are
 affiliated with North Korea aren't included in that number).
 There are an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Koreans in China,
 which borders North Korea. And about 450,000 live in the
 Soviet Union, some as far away as Tashkent, near
 Afghanistan, where they were forcibly moved during the
 Stalin era.
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean government is also trying to foster a
 sense of a "Korean commonwealth" among overseas Koreans,
 particularly in the Soviet Union and China, who have easier
 access to North Korea. South Korean business ventures, such
 as a Siberian logging operation by the giant Hyundai group,
 use ethnic Koreans.
                                                                                                       

   "We will open a small hole with business that will create
 more change," says Lee Hong Koo, a South Korean adviser.
 "Build a national community through business, and political
 solution will naturally follow," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Soviet music and athletic coaches of Korean heritage have
 been invited to South Korea. The government also sponsored
 an Olympic-style Pan-Korean athletic competition in late
 1989 that drew 1,326 Korean competitors from 50 nations.
 Diplomats in Seoul say the event seems to have created a
 feeling of belonging among Koreans that may translate into
 pressure on North Korea as well.
