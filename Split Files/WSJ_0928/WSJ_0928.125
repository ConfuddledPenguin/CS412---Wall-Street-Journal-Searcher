   Chase Manhattan Corp. said it was firing 98 workers in its
foreign-exchange and money-market operations in London in the
first wave of a plan to trim its non-U.S. operations by 1,600
employees.
   The bank holding company said it also had trimmed five
workers from its Frankfurt foreign-exchange operations and
closed its Zurich dealing room, eliminating 20 jobs.

   The cuts are part of a decision, which Chase announced a
week ago, to trim costs by shedding 5,000 employees
world-wide. Chase has about 2,600 remaining U.K. employees
and 4,500 throughout Europe. A spokesman declined to say how
many more of the planned non-U.S. reductions would come from
its London and European pool of workers. Chase intends to
complete all of its the staff reductions by year end, the
spokesman added.
   The cutbacks stem from the company's deteriorating
commercial real estate loan portfolio.
