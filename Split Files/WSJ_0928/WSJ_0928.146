   MONTREAL -- BCE Inc. and Nynex Corp. are joining with a
Mexican financial concern to bid for control of Telefonos de
Mexico.
   The joint venture is the first group to announce it will
make an offer for a 20.4% TelMex equity stake held by the
Mexican government. The 20.4% block represents just over half
of TelMex's full-voting shares. Three other groups are
expected to join the bidding.

   Henri Roy, a BCE senior vice president, said that based on
the current stock price TelMex is worth about $7 billion,
giving the 20.4% stake an indicated value of about $1.4
billion.
   Mr. Roy wouldn't say if the joint venture expects to offer
a premium for the control block. The Mexican government
currently holds about 56% of TelMex while the remainder is
publicly held.
   BCE and Nynex will each own about 25% of the venture and
Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican financial
concern, will own at least 50.1%. Mr. Roy said the partners
are still working on the details of their bid, which must
include a detailed operating plan for TelMex.
   Under rules established by the Mexican government, groups
making bids must be at least 50.1%-owned by Mexican investors
and must include at least one foreign telephone company. The
bidding process is only open to concerns approved by the
government. Four Mexican groups (a fifth dropped out) and 12
foreign telephone concerns have been accepted as possible
bidders by the government, Mr. Roy said.
   The bidding deadline is Nov. 15 and the government expects
to make a decision by the end of the year, Mr. Roy said.
   The winning bidder faces a massive job modernizing TelMex,
Mr. Roy said. But for BCE and Nynex the Mexican telephone
monopoly also represents a "tremendous opportunity." He said
there is the potential for "double-digit annual growth" at
TelMex. He said the telephone monopoly only has about five
million telephone lines in operation now and the Mexican
economy could support twice that number.
   Mr. Roy said the Mexican government has guaranteed TelMex
a monoply on basic phone service until 1996. He said the
telephone monopoly is profitable and has annual revenue of
about $5 billion.
   BCE, parent of Bell Canada, is a Montreal-based holding
company. Nynex is the New York-based Baby Bell. Inverlat is
based in Mexico City. The joint venture's announcement was
made after the market closed yesterday.
