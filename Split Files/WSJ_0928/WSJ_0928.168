   NEW YORK -- In the latest sign of Wall Street's rush to
profit from companies in financial distress, Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. said it finished raising a $750 million fund that will
invest in troubled corporations.
   Goldman's fund is the second biggest of more than 20
"restructuring" or "turnaround" investment pools being raised
this year, according to pension consultants. The Goldman
fund, known as Water Street Recovery Fund I, is exceeded in
size only by a $1 billion pool raised earlier this year by
Chicago investors Samuel Zell and David Schulte.

   Goldman figures there is plenty of money to be made from
turnaround investing. In the four years prior to setting up
the Water Street fund, the firm says it made 22 investments
of its own in distressed companies' bonds, bank debt or
equity, usually at cut-rate prices. Eleven of those
investments produced annual returns of 35% or better, says
Goldman partner Mikael Salovaara. Mr. Salovaara is managing
the new fund.
   In a memo to investors, the Water Street fund states that
it is seeking annual returns of 25% to 35%. If that goal is
achieved, Goldman will benefit richly. Goldman has $100
million of its own money in the fund; it also is entitled to
as much as 20% of the profits earned by its other investors,
which include corporate pension funds, university endowments
and foreign banks, mostly Japanese.
