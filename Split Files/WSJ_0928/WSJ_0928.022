   OSLO -- Norway's unemployment rate fell to 4% in late
September from 4.8% at the end of August, largely because of
government work programs, but the rate was up from 3.6% a
year earlier, the state Labor Directorate said.
   Unemployment has more than doubled since 1987, when the
annual unemployment figure was 2%.

   The directorate said 86,800 people in Norway were without
work in September, 17,600 fewer than in August but up 7,300
from September 1989.
   Provisional figures showed that the total of people
employed in government work and training programs in
September was about 43,300, up 15,400 from August. The total
was 57,300 in September 1989.
