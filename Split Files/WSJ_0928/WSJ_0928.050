   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange barred 12 people
from the securities industry for alleged violations of
exchange rules and federal securities laws.
   The NYSE charged that John Joseph Leadem of Normandy
Beach, N.J., a former broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., stole
$250,000 from a customer. Also barred was Joseph Patrick
Michael Desposito of Brooklyn, N.Y. The exchange alleged that
he stole funds from Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., where he was an
assistant controller.

   Eight individuals consented to a bar from the securities
industry, but didn't admit or deny wrongdoing: Michael R.
Freglette, Marietta, Ga.; Ralph Edgar Howard, Daly City,
Calif.; Amen S. Kahwajy, Richmond, Va.; Laurel Darlyne Lopez,
Waco, Texas; Michael John Pavkovich, Flint, Mich.; Michaele
P. Quinn, Winnetka, Ill.; Dorothy Kay Smith, Olympia, Wash.;
and James F. Wallace, Akron, Ohio.
   Two others, Harvey M. Bassin of Miami and Mark Muenster of
Clifton, N.J., were barred until they provide information the
exchange has requested.
   Four firms settled Big Board charges without admitting or
denying wrongdoing: Ferris, Baker Watts Inc., Washington;
Financial Clearing &amp; Services Corp. and Lepercq, De Neuflize
Securities Inc., both New York, and Rose &amp; Co. Investment
Brokers, Chicago. Financial Clearing was fined $45,000, while
the three others were assessed $20,000 each.
   The exchange took disciplinary action against a number of
individuals. Suspensions and fines are noted:
   Richard Baker Lohrer Jr., New York, 10 years; Thomas Lewis
Desmond Jr., Louisville, Ky., and Richard A. Wilburn, New
York, 30 months each; Robert M. Fanning, Newport Beach,
Calif., 18 months; and Lynn T. Shaw, Memphis, Tenn., one
month.
   The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:
   Michael S. Penfield, Billings, Mont., six years; Timothy
Harrington, Grenada Hills, Calif., three years; Ronald Harry,
Salt Lake City, one year; Robert Leslie Fell, Mineola, N.Y.,
six months; John P. Aquino, Clifton Park, N.Y., five months;
Rodney Dee Aftuck, Atlanta, three months and must complete a
course.
   And Howard R. Knapp, Sanibel, Fla., five weeks; Steven J.
Aquino, Latham, N.Y., and Jeffrey Eric Susskind, Santa
Monica, Calif., each one month and $10,000; Bruce E.
Piccirillo, Robstown, Texas, two weeks and $5,000; Salvatore
Guerrieri Jr., North Chili, N.Y., one week; Andrew Racz, New
York, $25,000; and Thomas M. McDonald, Hudson, Ohio, and
Jeffrey M. Tauber, Darien, Conn., censure only.
   Except as noted below, the firms and individuals involved
in New York Stock Exchange disciplinary proceedings couldn't
be reached for comment.
   At Ferris Baker Watts, General Counsel Theodore Urban
referred to the exchange's remarks in the matter, which say
in part that the firm's failure to fully comply with an NYSE
rule "reflected a systems-related problem at the firm's
clearing broker," and that the firm's "procedures in place
are adequate to handle the normal stream of {account}
transfers within the specified time frame." He said that at
any firm handling a large volume of account transfers, "there
are going to be slip-ups," and that the exchange hasn't
spelled out a standard of how many such errors might be
acceptable.
   Mr. Susskind said, "It was something that took place years
ago. It's unfortunate that it took so long to get it
resolved. I'm happy that it's been resolved."
   Messrs. Penfield and Harry and Ms. Quinn declined comment.
