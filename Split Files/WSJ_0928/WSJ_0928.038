   This I address to minds
   Superior:
   Isn't there somewhere
   A motive that isn't
   "Ulterior"?
   And why must wisdom,
   However translated,
   Be forever referred to
   As "accumulated"?
   Something else that
   Makes me glowerful:
   Need the Ways and Means
   Committee always be
   "Powerful"?

   A Stitch in Time
                                                                                                       

   There is one issue
   On which there's no doubt:
   A pressing problem
   Should be ironed out.
   If the irritant's not
   Cleared up in a twinkle,
   It may very well
   Add a new wrinkle.
