   Many entrepreneurs dream of making a killing on Wall
Street by taking their firms public. But even in glamour
industries, those dreams seem more remote now than just a few
months ago.
   Consider the contrasting experiences of Mid-American Waste
Systems Inc. and American Waste Services Inc. Both are in
waste management; as public concern mounts over waste
disposal, the industry has been a Wall Street darling.

   Only last May, Mid-American, based in Canal Winchester,
Ohio, had no trouble going public at $24 a share, a premium
over the underwriters' initial estimate of $19 to $21 a
share. The offering totaled $82.8 million. It gave the
company -- which earned only $1.8 million in 1989 on revenue
of $48.4 million -- an initial market valuation of more than
$220 million.
   But two-year-old American Waste, based in Youngstown,
Ohio, is meeting with resistance as it circulates a
preliminary prospectus for its offering, aimed at raising $84
million to $114 million.
   The anticipated price, according to the document, is $14
to $17 a share -- some 100 times "pro forma" earnings for
1989 (figures that factor -- in the increased number of
shares from the projected offering and the earnings from
expected acquisitions). With revenue of $37.4 million in
1989, American Waste would have a total market valuation of
more than $500 million.
   But many investors and analysts doubt the issue will fly
in that price range, even though prestigious Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. is leading the underwriters. Several report that Goldman,
recognizing the resistance, has begun talking about a
possible price slash, perhaps to $11 a share. (Goldman
declined to comment publicly on this or other aspects of this
article.)
   Late yesterday afternoon, American Waste acknowledged the
pressure. Chairman Ronald E. Klingle said, "We're in the
process of rethinking the pricing, but we're anticipating a
successful initial public offering in the very near future."
   The underwriters issued the prospectus last month. But
until early this week, neither American Waste nor Goldman
Sachs seemed willing to lower the price. One New England
money manager complained about this; but he added that on
Tuesday Goldman asked him if he would be interested in
American Waste at $11 a share. He said no.
   A more reasonable price for the company would be $9 a
share, said Brian Stansky, an industry analyst with T. Rowe
Price Associates, a Baltimore manager of mutual funds.
Assuming American Waste in 1991 earns 65 cents a share, the
number being kicked around by analysts, the company would
have a price multiple roughly in line with the current
multiple for Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., an established
leader in the field.
   Any setback would be rare for American Waste, which has
been growing fast, largely because of financing from such
institutional investors as First Analysis Corp., Robertson,
Stephens &amp; Co. and Hambro International Venture Fund. Net
income soared to $5.3 million last year from $1.1 million in
1988. Most attractive to investors, American Waste has
sizable landfill capacity, at a time of declining overall
waste-disposal capacity in the U.S. Besides operating
landfills, the company transports waste and brokers
waste-management services.
   American Waste would use the proceeds from going public to
finance acquisitions it has negotiated, to repay debt and to
purchase equipment, among other purposes.
   But existing shareholders paid only $1.04 a share, on
average, for their stock, the prospectus concedes; and any
new shares sold at $17 would have a book value of only $3.05
apiece.
   In a stronger stock market, investors might easily
overlook such numbers. "There's no question that American
Waste could have had an easier time six months ago," said
Larry Greenberg, manager of Fidelity Select Environmental
Service Portfolio, a Boston mutual fund. Indeed, the
confrontation with Iraq, the sagging economy and other
factors have battered the stock market. And the formerly
high-flying waste issues have retreated. "When there's a
market correction, they tend to correct more than the
market," Mr. Greenberg said.
   So investors are balking at the $14-to-$17 range quoted in
the prospectus."If someone pinned me down, I'd say we'd buy
it at $10," said Nicholas Stephens, managing director of
research at Edgewood Management Co., New York, a
money-management firm.
   At $14 to $17 a share, however, "I heard people saying
it's just too pricey right now," added Mr. Stephens, who
along with other prospective investors attended an American
Waste presentation Tuesday in Manhattan. (Goldman Sachs
turned away reporters who sought to attend the meeting.)
   The jittery market has highlighted the risks that go along
with the possible rewards in new waste-management stocks.
After soaring to $40.25 a share in July, even Mid-American
shares have undergone a trashing. In part, that's because
Jacksonville, Fla., will negotiate first with industry leader
Waste Management Inc. over a planned disposal site coveted by
Mid-American. Yesterday, Mid-American shares rose 50 cents to
close at $20.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
   Joseph McNay, chairman of Essex Investment Management Co.
in Boston, said he is adamant about not buying American Waste
at $14 to $17 a share. Relative to more-experienced companies
in the business, such as Waste Management and
Browning-Ferris, "the filing price is out of range," he said.
While Waste Management is selling at about 15 times projected
earnings for 1991, American Waste is seeking a multiple of 20
times projected earnings. Moreover, the smaller company is
"unseasoned," Mr. McNay said.
   If the proposed offering doesn't fly at a high price, the
issue would be an unusual reversal for the management of
American Waste, as well as for the company itself.
   American Waste's founders -- led by the 42-year-old Mr.
Klingle and President Darrell D. Wilson, 39 -- have completed
a series of lucrative transactions. For example, along with
other investors, Mr. Klingle and Mr. Wilson acquired a small
trucking company for $57,600 in 1988, the prospectus says; a
year later they sold it to American Waste for $2.8 million.
And the company paid $4.4 million in executive bonuses last
year when net income was $5.3 million.
   Mr. Klingle declined to comment on those disclosures. But
the prospectus says the trucking-company transactions and
other insider deals were negotiated "at arm's length" with
the existing non-management shareholders. And the prospectus
suggests that the bonuses reflected the success of the
company.
   Though the disclosures in the prospectus raised some
eyebrows, several potential investors stressed that their
resistance to the offering is a matter of price.
