   Rowan Cos. said third-quarter net of about 10 cents a
share, combined with an expected fourth-quarter profit could
result in its first profitable year since 1984.
   In the year-earlier third quarter, the energy service
concern had a net loss of about $211,000, or five cents a
share, on revenue of about $31.4 million. A spokesman said
the latest third-quarter net will be about $7.2 million, but
would say only that revenue "will definitely be better" than
last quarter -- referring to second-quarter revenue of about
$36 million.

   Rowan said it expects drilling revenue to offset seasonal
reductions in aviation activity, resulting in an overall
profitable fourth quarter. The company operates a fleet of
charter helicopters and other aircraft used in the energy
industry.
   Rowan said it expects a "borderline or break-even year."
In 1984, its last profitable year, Rowan had restated net of
$3.2 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of about
$198.4 million.
