   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. Gear Inc.'s fiscal third-quarter
profit fell 35% to $14.3 million, or 71 cents a share,
disappointing most analysts.
   The athletic-shoe maker said earlier this month it would
report lower profit in the quarter ended Aug. 31. Sales
climbed 40% to $300.3 million from $215 million. Net income
in the year-ago quarter was $22 million, or $1.21 a share.

   L.A. Gear said it expects fourth-quarter and full fiscal
year profit to fall from year-ago levels, in part because of
higher advertising expenses. Analysts had already been
predicting lower net so the forecast didn't come as any
surprise.
   Gross margins in the third quarter improved to 35.6% from
34.85%, less than some analysts expected. Faster sales growth
overseas than in the U.S., where sales produce higher
margins, restricted the gain, L.A. Gear said. In the quarter,
domestic sales grew only about 10% to $220 million.
   Advertising and promotional expense of $26.5 million in
the quarter included $9.3 million of expenses that had been
deferred from earlier in the year. L.A. Gear said it didn't
have any deferred advertising expense as of Aug. 31.
   To bolster market share, the company announced it is
boosting fourth-quarter advertising by about $2.5 million to
roughly $17 million. L.A. Gear's share has been increasing
since last year when it stood at about 10% of the $5 billion
athletic footwear market.
   Despite a difficult retail environment, "we continue to be
optimistic with regard to our potential and are enthusiastic
about our new products," said Robert Greenberg, chairman and
chief executive officer. The bigger advertising budget "is
intended to give us the greatest possible platform from which
to market our exciting new styles."
   In particular, L.A. Gear said it is launching a multimedia
campaign featuring San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Joe
Montana, to sell the company's Street Hiker shoe. L.A. Gear
didn't mention its new line advertised by singer Michael
Jackson. Some retailers have indicated that the shoe, which
costs up to $80 in some stores, is a flop.
   The shoe isn't a large percentage of projected sales or
inventory, said Kevin Ventrudo, chief financial officer.
"International sales have been good." A television commercial
with Mr. Jackson has helped the company's brand awareness
independent of the shoe's sales, he said.
   L.A. Gear fell 87.5 cents to $11.25 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. The profit report was
issued after the close of trading.
