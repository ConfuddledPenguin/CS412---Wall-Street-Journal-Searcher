   LONDON -- Brent Walker Group PLC said first-half pretax
profit rose 52%, but it cautioned that its high level of debt
and the general state of the U.K. economy are still cause for
concern.
   The U.K. leisure group said pretax profit climbed to #45.7
million ($85.6 million) from #30 million ($56.2 million) a
year earlier, exceeding the general level of market
expectations, which was around #40 million. In a statement to
the London Stock Exchange Friday, the company said the
results would meet expectations.

   Sales in the latest period leaped to #1.02 billion from
#203 million. Trading profit rose 94% to #93 million from #48
million.
   Brent Walker also said it intends to raise between #100
million and #120 million through an issue of 13% convertible
capital bonds. The issue, through its Brent Walker Capital
Ltd. subsidiary, is aimed at reducing debt, which the company
recently said totaled #1.25 billion.
   The company said profit after tax rose 49% to #36.3
million from #24.4 million. Per-share earnings rose 54% to
42.9 pence from 27.9 pence. Profit attributable to
shareholders, however, fell 45% to #35.3 million from #63.9
million. The latest results included a one-time loss of #1.1
million. The company had a one-time gain of #39.5 million a
year earlier.
   Brent Walker said it is leaving its interim dividend
unchanged at five pence a share because of the company's high
level of debt and the weakening U.K. economy. But it said its
continuing growth in profit reinforced its decision to
concentrate on the core sectors of leisure development: pubs
and brewing, betting services, and hotels and leisure.
