   WINTERSBURG, Ariz. -- The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission proposed a $75,000 civil penalty against the Palo
Verde Nuclear Generating Station for two apparent violations
of NRC rules on medical examinations for operators.
   The station is owned by a consortium of seven utilities,
including the Arizona Public Service Co. unit of Pinnacle
West Capital Corp., Phoenix.

   Licensed operators of nuclear power plants are required to
have biannual medical exams. The commission said the station
apparently failed to notify the NRC about four licensed
operators who had developed potentially incapacitating
medical conditions. It also cited apparent inaccuracies in
certification to the NRC that candidates for operator
licenses had received complete medical exams.
   The apparent violations occurred between May 1987 and last
August. Palo Verde said the safety of the plant wasn't
affected. Palo Verde has 30 days to respond to the notice.
