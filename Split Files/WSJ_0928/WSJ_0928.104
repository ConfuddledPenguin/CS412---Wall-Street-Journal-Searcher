   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. said its board
approved the buy-back of as many as 10 million of its common
shares in the open market.
   Apple, with 120 million shares outstanding on June 29,
said that current market prices for its shares were
attractive and that it would make the purchases "from time to
time." Apple said it has bought back about 30 million shares
