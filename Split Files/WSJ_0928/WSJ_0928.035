   FILIPINOS IN THE MIDEAST

   While thousands of Filipinos are fleeing the Persian Gulf
area, thousands more are still flocking to the Mideast
searching for jobs.
   Over the last year, an average of 15,000 Filipinos a month
left for jobs in the Gulf area, and that figure still holds
true despite the crisis precipitated by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, according to the state-run Philippine Overseas
Employment Agency. Chartered jets that recently flew hundreds
of refugees home from Jordan have been returning to the
Mideast packed with new job-seekers.
   Statistics show why Filipinos leave families behind to
work in the Mideast. The Philippine unemployment rate stands
at more than 8% and is expected to increase. Before the
crisis, an estimated 90,000 Filipinos were working in Kuwait
and Iraq; about 16,500 have returned to the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino's government has promised to help
workers who fled Kuwait and Iraq find other jobs abroad. But
fewer than 100 of the workers who have come home have found
new jobs overseas through government efforts.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING FRENCH FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   France's farm bank Credit Agricole has agreed to set aside
a large amount of money to help farmers restructure their
debts. Last week, government ministers warned the formerly
state-owned bank that it could lose lucrative privileges if
it didn't do more for the farmers, who have been hit by
drought and a fall in meat prices. Now the bank has said it
will raise its earlier offer of 200 million francs ($38.2
million) by 1.4 billion francs. This money, to be paid over
three years, will be placed in a new fund to help the
worst-hit farmers restructure their debts.
                                                                                                       

   SOUVENIRS OF A JOINT VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   Soviet customs authorities said they had seized 22
paintings, some stolen from Leningrad's Hermitage gallery,
and other valuables as they were being transported to West
Germany. The haul, valued at about $1.8 million, was seized
by officials in Lithuania. The Tass news agency, quoting
customs officials, said the haul included icons, coins, gold
and silver objects and a large amount of rubles and dollars.
It said the haul was being moved by an employee of a joint
venture who was heading for West Germany. It did not give the
nationality of the employee.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA SHOPS ABROAD
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will choose a foreign contractor by next June
for its first high-speed electric-train service, projected to
begin in 1998. Transportation Minister Kim Chang Shik said
South Korea needs to obtain foreign high technology for the
train service linking Seoul with the port city of Pusan.
France, West Germany and Japan reportedly have been lobbying
for the project, which Mr. Kim said would cost an estimated
$8.1 billion.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIETS MAKE A PAYMENT
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. and three other Japanese
steelmakers decided to resume production of steel pipes for
export to the Soviet Union, a Japanese news agency reported,
quoting industry sources. The decision came after the Soviet
Union paid Japanese trading companies $207 million for its
steel imports. The four companies suspended production of the
pipes in late May because they hadn't received any payment
since the beginning of the year.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY'S ANTITRUST LAW
                                                                                                       

   Italy's first antitrust law cleared its last hurdle when
it won Senate approval. The measure, which brings Italy into
line with regulations laid down recently by the European
Community, is designed to ensure free-competition principles
and prohibit the formation of monopolies or agreements among
companies that create dominant market positions.
                                                                                                       

   AID FOR EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   The European Community said it would give 20 million
European currency units ($26.2 million) to East Germany to
help the country tackle its environmental problems.
   Announcing an aid package worth a total of 35 million ECUs
for East Germany, the EC said it would, for the moment at
least, continue to give aid to East Germany even though the
country will cease to exist after Oct. 3.
   The EC said years of reliance on heavy and chemical
industries, coupled with the burning of low-grade coal, has
left East Germany with one of the most polluted environments
in Europe. Only 42% of the population has access to an
adequate sewerage system, the EC said.
   East Germany pumps more sulfur dioxide into the air than
any other European nation.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The World Health Organization reports that some 70% of the
world's children under the age of one are now being immunized
against the childhood diseases diptheria, measles, pertussis,
poliomyelitis, tetanus and tuberculosis. But about 2.6
million children still die from these diseases each year, and
some two million are disabled, WHO said. . . . Italy's
mission to the European Community in Brussels is closed from
one to four in the afternoon -- which is unmatched even by
the long-lunch standards of the Belgian capital. Callers
between those hours can hear soothing violin music while a
woman's recorded voice tells them in French and Dutch to
"Please hold on."
