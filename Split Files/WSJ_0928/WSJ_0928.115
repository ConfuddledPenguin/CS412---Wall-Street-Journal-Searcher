   PHILADELPHIA -- Believe it or not, some merchants and
restaurant owners here actually want to pay higher property
taxes.
   Their motives are selfish: They want to appoint themselves
tax collectors and see that the extra money gets spent
strictly to help their own businesses, by making their
streets cleaner and safer.

   These property owners, whose shops, cafes and restaurants
are sprinkled throughout an 80-block downtown area, say they
are fed up with inadequate city services. They're also
frustrated by vagrants, vandals and armed robbers, and afraid
of losing more business to the suburbs. So they propose
increasing their property taxes by 4.5%, creating about $6.2
million a year in supplemental funds for security and
sanitation services.
   A bookstore operator tells of the time police took 45
minutes to respond to an armed robbery. A clothing-store
owner describes winos who stare while customers try on suits.
Sam Talucci, who owns the Magnolia Cafe, complains of bricks
thrown through his front window and vagrants sleeping on the
sidewalk.
   Business at the Magnolia is down 10% to 15% from last
year, Mr. Talucci says. He's willing to pay more in taxes if
it will help bring customers back. "Why should customers want
to put themselves through Dante's Inferno?" he asks.
   David Mink, an owner of the Sansom Street Oyster House,
doesn't object to the extra $500 a year the new plan would
cost him. "The city administration has lost control of the
streets," Mr. Mink says. "The perception is not healthy from
outside the city, and the perception is the reality."
   Hundreds of municipal governments around the country have
allowed and even encouraged the formation of
business-improvement districts as a means to pay for big
capital improvements. More recently, these special-services
districts have started to address issues of safety and
sanitation management.
   New York City has about 20 business-improvement districts,
the largest being Grand Central Partnership. The Downtown
Seattle Association has been sweeping streets since 1985. In
Oregon, the Association for Portland Progress charges the
city for services it provides. Similar programs are under way
in such cities as Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C.
   In Philadelphia, the need is especially urgent. The city
government faces a fiscal crisis and says it expects to run
out of operating funds by Dec. 1. Deep cuts in many city
services, including police and sanitation, may soon be
unavoidable.
   But the plan for Philadelphia's business-improvement
district hatched long before the fiscal crisis flared. A
private, not-for-profit group, Central Philadelphia
Development Corp., came up with the idea in 1985. The concept
picked up momentum last fall when the group recruited Ronald
Rubin, a prominent downtown developer, to become a spokesman
and rally support for the district in the business community.
   (Mr. Rubin has 13 properties in the district, including
two that are tax-abated. He has promised to pay the full tax
on both abated properties, about $100,000 extra.)
   In March, Philadelphia's City Council voted to allow Mr.
Rubin's group of self-appointed board members to form a
quasi-governmental, private authority, called the Special
Services District. They crafted a plan and a budget for the
district. Then, at a public hearing in August, the group
presented its ideas and solicited comment from affected
property owners.
   Philadelphia's special-services district would be the
nation's largest in area covered. The police already
allocated to the zone would be redeployed through a new,
centrally located facility. The district would hire 40
"community service representatives" equipped with two-way
radios linked to the police hub. These people would serve as
extra security and a source for tourist information. The
district also plans to hire 115 laborers to sweep and wash
the sidewalks.
   But many downtown residents aren't interested in sharing
the cost of improving business conditions. At hearings, they
complained that they had no way to pass on the higher
charges, unlike merchants and building owners.
   To avoid jeopardizing passage of its plan, the district
developed a special account, funded by voluntary
contributions from tax-exempt properties, such as hospitals,
universities, religious institutions and tax-abated real
estate. Owner-occupants can opt to charge their assessed tax
to the special account. The district says it already has
several promised donations.
   "We get all the benefits and we don't have to pay
anything" extra, said Samuel Berlin, president of Kennedy
House, where 75% of the residents are retired or on a fixed
income.
   The city council will probably vote on the measure by the
end of October, and the authority hopes to start collecting
the new tax by the end of the year. Billing and collecting
will be left to the authority; no money will pass through
city coffers. But the city has offered its enforcement
resources to the private tax collectors. In the event of
delinquencies, the city would file liens and judgments
against properties that are one year behind in payment.
   Councilman John F. Street represents most of the people
who live in the proposed district, and he still has some
doubts about the plan. Since the authority is to be an
extension of the municipal government, he questions why the
authority has budgeted a $75,000 salary for the district
administrator. Notes Mr. Street: "The mayor makes only
$70,000."
