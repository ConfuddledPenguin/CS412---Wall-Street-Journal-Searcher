   COPIAGUE, N.Y. -- TII Industries Inc., a maker of surge
protection and specialized electronic devices, said filing of
its results for the year ended June 29 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission will be delayed, because of the
"imminent completion" of negotiations with bank lenders to
restructure loan agreements.
   TII said release of the fiscal 1990 data to shareholders
is expected to be delayed as long as 15 days.
