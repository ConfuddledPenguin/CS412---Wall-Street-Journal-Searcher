   Bondholders of Australia-based Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
approved the sale of its brewery assets to its 58%-owned Bell
Resources Ltd. unit.
   The holders of US$200 million of 10-year 5 3/4%
subordinated convertible bonds carried the resolution in
London to sell the division. Bell plans to sell a 50% stake
in the breweries to Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand-based
brewer, and operate them as a joint venture.

   The clearance followed by a day Alan Bond's resignation as
chairman and a director of the company, to pave the way for
the financially troubled concern to be restructured. Mr. Bond
foreshadowed his departure in July, saying he would step down
if European holders of some Bond Corp.-related securities
approved the sale of the company's Australian brewing
interests. Even though European investors cleared the brewery
sale yesterday, the deal could still collapse unless a group
of investors who hold US$510 million of debentures issued by
Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. in the U.S. agree to sell their
securities back to the company at a discount.
