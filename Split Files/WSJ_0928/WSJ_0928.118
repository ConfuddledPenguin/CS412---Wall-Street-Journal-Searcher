   WASHINGTON -- Neil Bush conceded that while he was a
director of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association, he
stood to benefit financially from a $900,000 line of credit
he sought from the thrift for a business partner.
   The president's son, testifying in a hearing on the Office
of Thrift Supervision's conflict-of-interest charges against
him, also acknowledged that other aspects of the proposed
line of credit for Good International Inc., run by real
estate developer Kenneth Good, were "unusual." Mr. Bush
agreed with OTS lawyers that it was abnormal that no
collateral was sought to back the line of credit, but
insisted that wasn't important because "there was never any
intention that the line of credit be funded."

   Mr. Bush also conceded that it was unclear whether Mr.
Good even had that much collateral because the ailing Western
real estate markets had hurt his business. Silverado failed
in December 1988, and the government says it will cost
taxpayers about $1 billion to bail out its depositors.
   Mr. Bush, who didn't attend the previous two days of
hearings here, was feisty and impatient through three hours
of testimony. He veered from the questions posed to him to
deliver a broad defense of his actions, saying he "never had
a doubt" that he had no conflict of interest despite his
business ties to Mr. Good and another large Silverado
borrower, Bill Walters.
   Mr. Bush, an outside director for Silverado from 1985 to
1988, argued that Silverado was the victim of an economic
downturn. "When real estate values go from X to one-third of
X, the success of the institution is impaired," Mr. Bush
said. "Not for any wrongdoing, not because the board of
directors didn't act properly, but because of the
circumstances."
   Mr. Good was an investor in Mr. Bush's oil and gas
company, JNB Exploration Co. He formed Good International to
participate with another company of Mr. Bush's, JNB
International Inc., in a consortium to seek oil and gas
business in Argentina. The Argentine government originally
requested the line of credit as proof of financial viability,
but later agreed to accept Mr. Good's personal guarantee, Mr.
Bush said. The line of credit was approved by the Silervado
board, with Mr. Bush abstaining, but was never extended.
   The OTS has charged that the credit line would have
benefited Mr. Bush and would have violated restrictions on
the size of loans to thrift employees. Mr. Bush maintained in
written testimony in August that he never expected any
benefit because the credit line wasn't to be drawn on.
   But under questioning yesterday, Mr. Bush said that
because the line of credit was intended to help Good
International and JNB International gain oil and gas
business, he could have benefited. "I had hoped that as a
result of bidding and as a result of getting qualified and as
a result of drilling wells, that there would be some
benefit," he said.
   Mr. Bush's statement could prove to be a significant
weapon for the OTS, because it specifically has charged him
with "attempting to bring about a transaction that, if
consummated, would have resulted in benefit to himself."
   Under questioning from OTS attorney Stephen Hershkowitz,
Mr. Bush insisted that the Argentine government was willing
to accept the letter of credit as proof of financial strength
even though it was made clear it wouldn't be funded. "It was
bells and whistles," Mr. Bush said. "I know it sounds like
complete and utter nonsense."
   The OTS has charged Mr. Bush with violating
conflict-of-interest regulations in two other instances. Only
a month after the board approved the line of credit,
Silverado accepted $3 million from Mr. Good in exchange for
releasing more than $11.5 million in collateral because Mr.
Good claimed he was almost insolvent. The OTS says Mr. Bush
erred in not telling the Silverado board that at the time Mr.
Good had an option to invest $3 million in JNB Exploration.
Mr. Bush said yesterday he would have made the disclosure,
but the option to invest the $3 million wasn't "firm."
   OTS also has charged that Mr. Bush shouldn't have voted on
more than $100 million in loans to Mr. Walters, another real
estate developer, because a bank controlled by Mr. Walters
had loaned JNB Exploration $1,750,000. Mr. Good and Mr.
Walters had at least $130 million in loans and other
transactions from Silverado, and the thrift had a loss of at
least $60 million on the loans.
   Mr. Bush yesterday reiterated his argument that he had no
conflict of interest in the Walters transactions because he
didn't invest in Mr. Walters' companies and thus wouldn't
benefit from the loans. "He never once asked me, `Neil, how
are we going to get this deal through?'" Mr. Bush said. "My
loyalty was to Silverado."
   The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order against Mr.
Bush, a mild sanction that would bar him from violating
conflict-of-interest regulations in the future.
   Mr. Bush was the last of 11 witnesses to testify in three
days of hearings here. The administrative law judge who
presided over the hearing, Daniel Davidson, will consider the
case and make a recommendation to the OTS director in early
January. OTS Director Timothy Ryan then has until early May
to make a final decision.
   Last week, Mr. Bush and 11 other officials of Silverado or
its holding company were named in a separate $200 million
civil lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
alleged "gross negligence" in operating the thrift.
