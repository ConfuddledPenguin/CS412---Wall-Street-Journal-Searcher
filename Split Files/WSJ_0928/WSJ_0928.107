   STOCKHOLM -- Big banks and market regulators are
scrambling to head off a crisis that has crippled Sweden's
high-flying commercial paper market and called into question
the survival of several big finance companies.
   The trouble started Monday, when sour property loans
forced Nyckeln Holding AB, one of Sweden's biggest finance
companies, to slash its full-year profit forecast. The news
sent shares of Nyckeln and its parent Beijer Capital AB into
a free fall on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

   Even worse, as investors shunned its commercial paper in
Stockholm markets Nyckeln sank into a liquidity squeeze.
Problems swiftly spread to other finance companies, which
like Nyckeln had been big dispensers of real estate credits.
   By yesterday morning, when the Gamlestaden AB unit of
Nobel Industries AB announced it no longer could meet payment
obligations because of acute liquidity woes, the exchange had
halted trading in six companies' shares.
   Trading reached a virtual standstill in commercial paper
issued by about 30 Swedish finance companies. The companies
rely heavily on those corporate IOU's with maturities of as
much as six months for the bulk of their normal financing
needs. Alarmed regulatory authorities huddled with big
Stockholm banks, trying to arrange emergency financing and
avert bankruptcies.
