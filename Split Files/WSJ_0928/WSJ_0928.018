   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the
Supreme Court nomination of Judge David Souter by a 13-1
vote, and approval by the full Senate is expected next week.
   At least five of the eight Democrats on the committee
expressed reservations about the views of the 51-year-old New
Hampshire judge, but only Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts voted against him.

   Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), the committee chairman, said
his support for the nominee "is a very close call." He said
he has questions about Judge Souter's commitment to
separation of church and state, eliminating race and sex
discrimination, and protecting the right to privacy and
abortion. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said he was
unsure but was voting his instincts. "My sense is that David
Souter is a fair and open-minded jurist," he said.
   Including Sen. Kennedy, six senators, all Democrats, have
announced their opposition to Judge Souter thus far. And
Senate aides say there aren't likely to be more than a dozen
votes against the nomination. The opponents are Sens. Bill
Bradley and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Alan Cranston of
California, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Brock Adams of
Washington.
   Yesterday, Sen. Kennedy warned that Judge Souter might
"solidify a 5-4 anti-civil rights, anti-privacy majority
inclined to turn back the clock. . ."
