   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s 92%-owned
Asamera Minerals Inc. unit said it is withdrawing plans to
sell its assets, citing depressed gold prices.
   The company's main asset is a 51% stake in the Cannon gold
and silver mine at Wenatchee, Wash., which last year produced
150,420 ounces of gold. Asamera said it won't resume efforts
to sell assets until gold prices rise and "the market
recognizes the value" of its holdings.

   Toronto-based Corona Corp., a big gold producer that
indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine through an
affiliate, Breakwater Resources Ltd., previously terminated a
pact under which it would have acquired most of Asamera's
assets, for stock valued at about 98.8 million Canadian
dollars (US$84.8 million). Other rumored bidders have failed
to materialize.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which Corona holds a 27.6%
interest, owns 49% of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, Asamera appointed Russell Wood president and
chief executive, succeeding Bill Cooper, who is retiring. Mr.
Wood was president and chief executive for Copper Range Co.,
of White Pine, Mich., prior to its sale in 1989, Asamera
said.
   Gulf Canada, 74.3%-owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is
selling certain assets to reduce debt.
