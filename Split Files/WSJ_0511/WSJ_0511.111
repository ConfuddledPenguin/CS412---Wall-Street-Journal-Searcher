   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator remained unchanged in April, as semiconductor
orders continued a steady increase.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association said the so-called
book-to-bill ratio for April was 1.09:1, the same as in
March. Both figures are preliminary. A 1.09 rate means that
for every $100 of products shipped, or billed, chip makers
received $109 in new orders, or bookings.

   The rising indicator shows stability in the chip market
instead of the slump many were expecting for 1990, said Doug
Andrey, the chip association's statistics director. "The
great fear was that of a recession, but the figures show a
relatively flat" chip market instead, he said. Bookings tend
to peak in April and May during a flat year, he said, and
fall off in the seasonally slower months.
   Semiconductor billings in April were $1.114 billion, 14.2%
lower than March's $1.298 billion and 10.5% lower than the
year-ago period, when billings were $1.245 billion. Average
monthly orders for the three months ended April 30 were
$1.279 billion, 1% above March's figure of $1.267 billion and
2.7% lower than orders during the year-ago period, which were
$1.315 billion.
   Until April, the book-to-bill ratio rose every month after
skidding to 0.88 in September, the lowest level since 1985.
