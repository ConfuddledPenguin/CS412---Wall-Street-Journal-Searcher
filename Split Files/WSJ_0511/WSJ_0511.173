   "Yields on money-market funds changed very little during
the week," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief
economist at the Washington-based institute. But yields on
direct money-market instruments were "quite volatile," he
said. "These changing relationships may have prompted money
managers, as well as individuals to engage in asset
shuffling."
