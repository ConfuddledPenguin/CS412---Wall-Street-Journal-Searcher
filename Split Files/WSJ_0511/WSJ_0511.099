   WASHINGTON -- After a sometimes emotionally charged
debate, the House passed a bill that would grant workers as
much as 12 weeks of unpaid annual leave to care for newborn
or adopted children, or seriously ill family members.
   But the vote, 237-187, fell short of the two-thirds vote
needed to override the presidential veto predicted earlier
this week by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.

   Administration officials say President Bush believes the
government shouldn't force employers to offer specific
benefits. Business groups, fearing the leave bill could lead
to mandated health insurance, vehemently opposed the measure
on that basis.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, the Iowa Republican who led the fight
against the measure, said he was cautiously optimistic that
the narrow House vote would dim the bill's prospects in the
Senate, where a similar bill would grant workers 10 weeks of
unpaid family leave annually and another 13 weeks of unpaid
personal medical leave over a two-year period.
   It is uncertain when the Senate will take up the matter
for consideration. Both measures exempt very small businesses
based on the number of employees.
   But Rep. Patricia Schroeder, (D., Colo.), who first
introduced the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1985, said she
was "delighted" with the vote. "I think we're in the ball
park {for overriding any veto}. Congress understands what
American families are going through. People stood up and did
what they think is right."
   The House bill sets a total of three months of unpaid
leave to cover either the employee's own medical emergencies,
the care of newborn or adopted children or the care of
seriously ill family members. Businesses would be required to
continue health benefits during the period.
   Sponsors of the House measure said the legislation would
cost businesses close to $200 million annually to cover the
cost of health benefits for workers on leave and the cost of
training temporary replacements.
   Companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't covered by
the measure. The provisions, a compromise fashioned by Reps.
Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) and Curt Weldon, (R., Pa.), scaled
back Rep. Schroeder's original measure that set separate
leave periods for family and medical needs.
   During the floor debate, Reps. Vic Fazio, (D., Calif.) and
Democratic Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) spoke
of their personal family crises when their children
contracted cancer. Rep. Raymond McGrath, (R., N.Y.), said his
family recently had to hire a full-time nurse to care for his
mother who needs round-the-clock care. "We turn away from
this at our peril," Mr. Fazio said. "It's tough enough for
families to make it economically in this country. I hope
we'll have at least the compassion to make this one step
forward."
   Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, known for his
anti-abortion views, said that he "agonized over the bill.
I'm not appalled by federal mandates; we do it for jury duty
and ROTC. . . .society should encourage motherhood and not
abortions."
   Opponents of the bill emphasized that mandating family
leave would reverse the trend toward letting workers
negotiate with employers for the benefits they prefer and
favor high-income workers who can better afford to take
unpaid time off.
   "The government can't balance the budget, it can't control
spending, yet it's trying to micromanage the private sector,"
said John Sloan, president of the National Federation of
Independent Business, a small-business group. But a lobbyist
for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, Mary
Tavenner, said that faced with the presidential veto threat,
the vote "sends a clear signal that this bill is technically
dead in the water." The groups represent small and large
companies.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, (R., N.J.), one of the bill's
co-sponsors, said that after the vote, she asked, for the
second time this week, that Republican supporters of the
measure get a chance to air their views at the White House.
   She said the administration's threat to veto the bill in
its present form used the usual "good cop-bad cop" language
that the administration adopts as it enters into
negotiations. She added that the measure's level of
bipartisan support and its concern for legitimate business
interests could ultimately get the president's support.
