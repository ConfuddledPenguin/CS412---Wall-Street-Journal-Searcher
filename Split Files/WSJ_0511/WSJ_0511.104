   WASHINGTON -- Two House members asked the Securities and
Exchange Commission to help create "any necessary legislative
solution" to an appeals court ruling last week that is likely
to hurt the agency's enforcement efforts aimed at insider
trading.
   Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Edward Markey (D.,
Mass.) also asked the agency to brief them on the impact of
the ruling by an appeals court panel, which overturned the
insider-trading conviction of Robert Chestman, a former
Gruntal &amp; Co. broker.

   Mr. Chestman had been convicted in federal district court
of insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock before the company
was acquired by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. The appeals
court ruling threatened to throw into turmoil the SEC's use
of its Rule 14e-3 in insider-trading cases. The rule makes it
a violation to trade on misappropriated tender-offer
information even if the defendant isn't violating a fiduciary
duty by making the trade.
   The government hasn't decided whether it will appeal the
latest ruling to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court.
   Legislation to restore any authority the SEC may have lost
as a result of the court action could include devising a
statutory definition of insider-trading, something Rep.
Dingell has opposed in the past.
