   STUTTGART, West Germany -- Chairman Edzard Reuter, under
fire for Daimler-Benz AG's faltering profits and a corporate
restructuring, is poised to at least temporarily disarm his
critics.
   Daimler-Benz is expected to announce next week that the
group's first-quarter profit was above the average quarterly
operating profit for 1989, as car sales in the U.S. and West
Germany bounced back from a 1989 slump. Group profit for 1989
was 1.7 billion marks ($1.04 billion), excluding a one-time
gain of 5.1 billion marks. Profits from the group's truck
division, which helped offset last year's slump in
passenger-car profits, show continued strength this year.
Meanwhile, Mr. Reuter says, the giant automotive, aerospace
and electronics concern is halfway toward completing a
cost-cutting program to reduce its annual overhead by 1.5
billion marks ($917 million).

   Sales, however, apparently remain under pressure. Although
Mr. Reuter said first-quarter sales rose by more than 6% over
the year-earlier 17 billion marks ($10.4 billion), the
calculation included sales of the Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm
G.m.b.H. aerospace group, which was acquired late last year.
   In an interview at Daimler-Benz's new headquarters on the
outskirts of Stuttgart, Mr. Reuter elaborated on his vision
of the group as "an integrated transportation company, in
vehicles, railroads and aircraft." He also sees Daimler-Benz
developing into "a major player" in the fields of aerospace,
factory automation and electronics by the end of the decade.
   Earlier this year, Daimler-Benz stunned competitors by
announcing a string of potential alliances. In March, it
tentatively agreed to combine its jet engine operations with
the Pratt &amp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. of the
U.S. A few weeks later, Daimler's Messerschmitt unit agreed
to form a joint venture with the French aerospace group
Aerospatiale S.A. linking their helicopter businesses.
   But it is Daimler-Benz's negotiations with the Mitsubishi
group of Japan that offer the most dazzling possibilities.
Mr. Reuter said no major announcements are expected to come
from the Mitsubishi talks until spring 1991. Ultimately, he
said, he could foresee the possibility of a minor share swap
between, for example, the Mercedes-Benz AG automotive unit
and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to "underline the common
interests" of the two groups.
   Meantime, the Mitsubishi connection is expected to begin
paying off on at least a modest scale relatively soon. As a
result of a new distribution pact with Mitsubishi Motors, Mr.
Reuter said, Mercedes-Benz already expects "to double our
{car} sales in Japan within three or four years." Mercedes
sold 31,500 cars in Japan last year. Mr. Reuter also hopes to
jointly develop and produce a new generation of all-terrain
vehicles with Mitsubishi.
   But it's aerospace that offers possibilities for the most
capital-intensive alliance between Daimler-Benz and
Mitsubishi, including joint development of a new 75-seat
airliner. Even without alliances, he said, Daimler-Benz is
"quite confident that we have at least begun to set up an
internationally competitive group in aerospace." Mr. Reuter
said, referring to some U.S. fears about the potential
alliance, that such links aren't aimed at anyone, but simply
constitute good global strategy.
   The profit stabilization in Daimler-Benz's passenger-car
business during the first quarter may at least temporarily
halt worries about the company's mainstay automotive unit.
Mr. Reuter confirmed that operating profits from passenger
cars were down almost 30% last year.
   Daimler-Benz's car sales in West Germany dropped last year
to 247,100 from 270,800, while U.S. sales slipped to 75,700
from 83,700. But profitability in the U.S. is improving, he
said, "and this is in a way a little bit of a surprise"
because the top-of-the-line S-Class series is more than 10
years old and due to be replaced by new models next year.
