   SAN FRANCISCO -- Charles Schwab &amp; Co. is doing just the
opposite of what most of the rest of the brokerage industry
is doing these days.
   Instead of laying off employees and closing offices, the
nation's largest discount broker is hiring more people and
plans to open 15 new offices in the Midwest and East this
year. Rather than cutting back on services, it is adding
more. Last year alone, it launched 11 new products, including
Second Opinion, which faxes reports by other firms' stock
analysts to Schwab customers on request.

   The moves are a bold attempt to gain market share from the
company's discount rivals while repositioning Schwab as a
midsize competitor to the giant Wall Street brokers. "As the
1990s begin, we will make another advance in market share
because of the restructuring of Wall Street," says Charles R.
Schwab, the firm's chairman and founder. "Wall Street has
once more taken a bite out of its own tail."
   Most analysts applaud the strategy and the way Schwab is
executing it. "They are on the leading edge of what the
retail brokerage business will be in the 1990s," says Richard
Ross, a financial services marketing executive at Elrick &amp;
Lavidge, a Chicago market-research firm. "If left alone, they
will own it."
   But a number of Schwab's competitors portray the firm's
expansive game plan as a high-risk gamble during a time when
many individual investors are still shunning the stock
market. "It's dangerous to expand the number of offices to
125 at a time like this," says Jack White, president of Jack
White &amp; Co., a San Diego discount broker.
   With all its new products and services, Schwab isn't
trying to compete as the lowest price discount broker.
Indeed, according to Mercer Inc., a New York firm that tracks
discount commissions, Schwab's average commissions are
slightly higher than those charged by Fidelity Investments'
discount brokerage unit and Quick &amp; Reilly Inc. And they are
almost twice as high as some of the "deep discount" firms.
   Still, Schwab's brokerage commissions are less than half
those at full-service brokers, says Mercer president Mark
Coler. Full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. provide customers with a variety
of services, including stock-market research and a broker who
offers investment advice.
   By offering almost as many services as the full-line firms
but at a cheaper price, Schwab is betting that it can not
only increase the amount of business it does with existing
discount-broker customers, but also snare customers fed up
with the big Wall Street houses.
   "Wall Street sold the public all that garbage," says Mr.
Schwab, referring to junk bonds, no-load mutual funds, unit
trusts and limited partnerships. "They lost sight of the fact
that individuals get angry and won't forget."
   So far, Schwab's blueprint is working. Earnings doubled in
1989, although they slipped 7.5% in the 1990 first quarter.
Contrasted with a collection of weak and battered brokerage
house stocks, Schwab surged to $15 from a low of $6.75 last
year. The stock closed yesterday at $15.75, down 12.5 cents
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In addition Schwab has strong free cash flow for its
ambitious expansion efforts. Schwab's reported earnings
understate the amount of cash it has available to expand. Mr.
Schwab bought back his company from BankAmerica Corp. in 1987
in a $280 million leveraged buy-out, and the company has
large depreciation and amortization that depress its reported
earnings but don't affect its cash.
   One of Schwab's new growth areas is handling trades for
financial advisers, who now have $3 billion of their
customers' money with Schwab, up from nothing two and a half
years ago. Schwab also is gaining a toehold in the corporate
financial services market by providing 401(k) plans,
stock-option financing and dividend-reinvestment plans for
employees.
   Still, says Mr. Schwab, "The base of the company is the
individual investor."
   The firm offers two different trading systems for
customers with personal computers. Now it is rolling out
nationally its new TeleBroker trading service, which allows
customers to trade and receive stock quotes and account
information with a Touch-Tone phone. Competitors Fidelity
Investments and Quick &amp; Reilly also have computerized
trading, but their systems are less elaborate and they don't
yet offer Touch-Tone trading.
   Schwab also has been building up its assets under
management by selling services such as its Schwab One cash
management accounts, which combine a brokerage account with a
money market account with check-writing privileges and a
credit card.
   Schwab One balances have soared to a record $3 billion.
The firm makes about seven-tenths of a cent on every dollar.
"It's not a big deal individually, but $50 to $100 for each
customer ends up as millions of dollars for the firm," says
Mr. Schwab.
   Schwab's Mutual Fund Marketplace allows customers to
invest in more than 400 no-load and low-load mutual funds,
for a fee. It is becoming a significant revenue contributor,
with $2.1 billion in assets. Of course, that pales besides
Fidelity's huge mutual fund family. Fidelity also offers to
buy other mutual funds for customers, and Jack White also has
a mutual fund trading system.
   Some competitors say all these extras could turn out a
burden if the retail brokerage business constricts even
further. Tom Quick, president of Quick &amp; Reilly, says Schwab
"is involved in building market share at the expense of
profits."
   Doyle Lyons, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says that
Schwab's stock "could be more vulnerable" than other
brokerage stocks in a downturn because of its increased
expenses from new products and facilities.
   Schwab executives counter such criticism. "We have our
foot on the gas pedal now," says Hugo Quackenbush, senior
vice president, "but we can take it off at any time." In
1988, he says Schwab cut costs drastically reducing its
break-even point from 16,000 trades a day to 8,000 trades.
   Moreover, Schwab is betting that the 1990s won't be a
10-year down cycle for the stock market. Demographics are
moving to favor the investment business and his firm, Mr.
Schwab says. "There'll be an increasingly older population
with more money to invest, and there's a trend toward more
intelligent consumerism."
