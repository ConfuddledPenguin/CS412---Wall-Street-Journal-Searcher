   GRANDVILLE, Mich. -- Despite a drop in first-quarter
earnings, X-Rite Corp. said it should meet an analyst's
prediction that 1990 net income will rise to more than $4
million, or about 80 cents a share, from $3.6 million, or 70
cents a share, the previous year.
   Ted Thompson, X-Rite chairman, president and chief
executive officer, says he is upbeat despite a lackluster
first quarter in which earnings fell 6.6% to $764,000, or 15
cents a share, from $818,000, or 16 cents a share, a year
earlier. Quarter revenue rose 10% to $5.5 million from $5
million.

   X-Rite has diversified from its original business of
developing tapes to mark X-rays, and currently derives 77% of
its $21.2 million in annual revenue from sales of
quality-control instruments, including color-measurement
instruments used in the graphic-arts industry.
   In December, X-Rite began rolling out a new line of
machines designed for broader industrial uses such as
measuring the colors of paints, fabrics, ceramics, floor
coverings. Mr. Thompson said the new instruments have been
well received, but it is too early to predict how they will
affect revenue and profit for the year.
   X-rite is nearly half owned by a group of insiders,
including Mr. Thompson. The company has no debt and about
$9.3 million in cash and short-term investments.
   X-rite recently raised its quarterly dividend to three
cents a share from two cents. Mr. Thompson doesn't want to
raise the dividend again, however, despite the substantial
cash position for a company its size. Instead, Mr. Thompson
wants to use the cash to finance a factory expansion as well
as inventory, marketing, and other costs associated with the
new line of instruments.
