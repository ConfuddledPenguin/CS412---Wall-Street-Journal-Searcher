   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department stunned commodity
analysts and traders by forecasting a 1990 winter wheat
harvest of 2.09 billion bushels, a 44% jump from last year's
weather-damaged crop.
   The projection for the biggest winter-wheat crop since
1981, based on a May 1 survey, is likely to trigger a plunge
in wheat futures prices today because most market analysts
had anticipated a decidedly smaller increase in production.
Many had expected the department to project production at
1.96 billion bushels, 35% above the 1.45 billion in 1989.

   In a separate report on global supply and demand, the
department said that it expects corn farmers to harvest 8.1
billion bushels this year, up nearly 8% from last year. But
gains in corn use may outpace gains in production and thus
keep corn stockpiles tight, the department said.
   At the same time, the department said that world wheat
production is likely to rise 6% to a record level in the
marketing year beginning July 1, with increases predicted for
the Soviet Union, European Community, China and Canada as
well as the U.S.
   Department analysts also predicted record yields for the
1990 grain crop in the Soviet Union, primarily because of
favorable weather conditions. They forecast a grain harvest
of 215 million tons, up nearly four million tons from 1989.
But they said the Soviets will continue importing large
amounts of grain if they can obtain financing for corn and
wheat purchases. "Soviet credit needs will likely continue
heavy," they said in a Soviet outlook report.
   The Soviets are expected to import 36 million tons of
grain in 1990-91, only slightly less than the two previous
marketing years. The imports are likely to include 15 million
tons of wheat and 20 million tons of corn and other coarse
grains. Much of the grain will be used to feed livestock as
part of the Kremlin's efforts to improve the Soviet diet with
more meat.
   Wheat prices have been unsteady for several weeks because
of forecasts that the winter wheat crop in the Southern
Plains was improving rapidly. The government estimate,
however, greatly exceeds the conventional wisdom of private
forecasters.
   "It was higher than the highest conceivable guess," said
Walter Spilka, a grain analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co., New York.
   The winter wheat harvest is under way in Texas. If the
national harvest materializes as projected by the Agriculture
Department, stockpiles would begin refilling from their
lowest levels in 15 years.
   While total wheat stockpiles by mid-1991 would still be
roughly half the level that was common before the previous
two years of drought, they still could help put a damper on
food inflation. U.S. food prices rose 5.8% last year in large
part because drought slashed U.S. crops.
   Corn prices also are expected to falter at the opening of
trading today. Moreover, the corn harvest actually might be
larger than the 8.1 billion bushels the department projected.
The department based its estimate on a two-month-old survey
of farmers' planting intentions. Grain analysts speculate
that a rally in corn prices since then probably spurred
growers to plant as much as two million more acres in corn,
which could add roughly 240 million bushels to the harvest.
   On the basis of its May 1 survey, the department predicted
that 50.8 million acres of winter wheat, which were planted
last fall, will be harvested by the end of July, up 23% from
last summer. Winter wheat accounts for three-fourths of the
nation's wheat production; the rest consist of spring wheat
and durum wheat.
   Winter wheat yields are expected to average 41.1 bushels
an acre, up six bushels from 1989 when drought and frost
damage in Kansas and other Plains states cut sharply into
yields. The department described the condition of the Kansas
crop as good-to-excellent and predicted a harvest of 460.2
million bushels, a remarkable rebound from 213.6 million last
year.
