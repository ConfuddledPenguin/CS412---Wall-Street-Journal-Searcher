   GENEVA -- Union Bank of Switzerland President Robert
Studer criticized the Swiss government for pursuing
conflicting economic policies, and warned that if reforms
aren't implemented to make the Swiss financial center more
competitive, the country's largest banks may be forced to
take more of their business abroad.
   "A lot will depend on the government to create the
environment for the banks to do what they have to do in order
to stay internationally competitive, Mr. Studer said, in a
speech to the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. "If the
Swiss authorities continue to hinder Switzerland from
maintaining its present position . . ., the major Swiss banks
will certainly follow their customers."

   In particular, he attacked the government's 35%
withholding tax on interest and dividend income, and the
stamp tax on securities transactions, both of which he said
make Switzerland less competitive. The stamp tax alone, he
added, "is largely responsible for the noteworthy absence of
a liquid and developed money market in Switzerland, and for
driving the Eurobond market abroad."
   Mr. Studer also said various branches of the Swiss
government appear to be pursuing conflicting policies,
further muddying the image of the country's financial center.
   "Whereas the Swiss National Bank is following a tight
monetary policy to fight inflation, the government tells the
banks to restrict themselves in increasing lending rates," he
said.
