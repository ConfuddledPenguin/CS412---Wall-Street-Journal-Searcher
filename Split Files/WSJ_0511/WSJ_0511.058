   On a remote island deep in Louisiana swampland, the
McIlhenny family has spent the past 125 years quietly
churning its peppers into one of the hottest sellers around:
Tabasco sauce.
   In all those years, the family has never changed the
recipe, and it has introduced only three other Tabasco
products. It shuns advances in food technology. And workers
still handpick the peppers.
   But the strategy -- if it can be called that -- has
worked. McIlhenny Co., based on Avery Island, has captured,
and kept, the biggest market share in hot sauces -- almost a
third of it -- even though the fiery brew costs considerably
more than most other brands. It still profits every day from
developing the first widely sold hot sauce and, in essence,
creating the market.
   As the company creeps into the 21st century, though, it
feels pressure to expand. Profits must be divided among an
ever-growing number of family shareholders -- about 90 now.
Thus, the company is seeking new uses for the sauce and has
begun an aggressive marketing campaign.
   Meanwhile, McIlhenny still enjoys its rare status as a
"fortress" company -- an entrenched company whose market
strength often seems impenetrable. These businesses enjoy
brand recognition that companies far larger can only envy.
This series of articles on such companies will show how
several of them reached their favored positions -- and how
some are struggling to retain their status.
   Even among fortress companies, McIlhenny has an enviable
position. Tabasco sauce is sprinkled on foods from chili to
chop suey in more than 100 countries. Packages are printed in
15 languages. The Japanese, the second biggest users, dash
the sauce on spaghetti and pizza. About half the volume is
sold to Americans.
   So popular is the sauce that many think the brand name is
generic. In fact, the name is a Mexican word; "Grandpere just
liked the sound of it," says vice president Paul McIlhenny.
The closely held firm won't reveal sales or profits, but some
analysts estimate sales are more than $50 million a year and
growing.
   The U.S. hot-sauce market has nearly doubled in the past
five years; estimates vary from $37 million to $69 million
for 1989. Profiting from surging interest in Tex-Mex and
Cajun food and spicy chicken wings, most hot sauces have done
well. Nonetheless, many chefs insist on Tabasco, mainly
because it's so concentrated.
   "I may use 10 drops of Tabasco, but I can trust that 10
drops," says Paul Prudhomme, Louisiana's celebrated chef,
who's cooked with Tabasco for 33 years now. "It pushes the
natural flavor of the food. There's an afterglow in your
mouth."
   Even among competitors, the brand commands respect. Durkee
French Foods, second in market share with 22%, touts that it
sells more of its Red Hot sauce based on volume. But,
"McIlhenny is laughing all the way to the bank," says Cal
Garrett, a manager at the Cincinnati-based company. "They've
built a great niche."
   Roughly 10% of Tabasco users consume 40% of the sauce. But
the very essence of Tabasco's success -- a distinctively hot
taste -- keeps the two-ounce bottles in cupboards of the
average consumer for nine months. So fifth-generation
President and Chief Executive Officer Edward "Ned" McIlhenny
Simmons is on a mission to make Tabasco as commonplace as
salt and pepper. "We'd like one in your kitchen and one on
your dining room table," he says.
   After years of advertising Tabasco in trade and consumer
publications as a condiment for recipes, McIlhenny Co. now
pushes new uses with a boldness unseen in its past. Just five
years ago, for example, it ran its first television
commercial.
   Various 30-second spots now show Avery Island natives
topping all sorts of foods with Tabasco. In print ads pushing
a "power breakfast," the company suggests adding a few drops
to hash browns, grits and omelets. "That'll get your engine
started," the ad says.
   The first natural extension of the Tabasco line came about
16 years ago: a Bloody Mary mix. The company says this
remains a "profitable addition" to its line.
   In 1982, the company introduced a picante sauce, a
stew-like dip popular in the Southwest, which is merely
limping along against more established brands. Recently, the
company launched "Tabasco 7-Spice Chili Recipe," which is
being test-marketed in five major U.S. cities.
   Mr. Simmons defends the cautious marketing approach,
saying, "We could wash the chili sauce out tomorrow, and we'd
have a few gray hairs, and we'd have spent a few dollars, but
we're not going to have bankers crawling all over us."
   Nonetheless, the company is considering a new brand line,
McIlhenny Farms, that would include pepper jellies, barbecue
sauces and mustards for the gourmet section of supermarkets.
   Gourmet brand extensions were the last thing Edmund
McIlhenny fretted about when he developed the fiery flagship
product. Driven from Avery Island by the Civil War, the
self-made New Orleans banker returned to find the family home
and surrounding sugar fields and salt domes in ruins. Among
the things left standing were pepper plants from Mexican
"Capsicums Frutescens" seeds, which he had planted before the
family left.
   Mr. McIlhenny found that by grinding the peppers, aging
them and adding vinegar and salt, he could make a pepper
sauce, a novelty that gave zest to the bland food prevalent
after the war.
   In 1869, Mr. McIlhenny poured the sauce in some 350
bottles -- mostly old cologne bottles -- and sent them to
food brokers around the area. The following year, he received
orders for thousands more.
   The shape of the bottles has changed little, as has the
process of making the sauce. From August to about November,
workers cull the island's 75 acres of peppers. A mechanized
picker was tried years ago but today sits idle in a
warehouse.
   To reduce labor costs and spread the risk of losing the
vulnerable crops to disease, the company says it raises 90%
of its peppers from the same seeds in Columbia, Honduras and
Venezuela.
   The peppers, chopped into small bits and packed in
50-gallon white oak casks, age for three warm seasons, almost
like fine wine. The company experimented with plastic vats
once, but tossed them aside.
   After the sauce is strained and poured into huge blending
tanks with distilled vinegar, a big mechanical arm stirs the
brew five minutes every hour. This is one of the few breaks
with the past, when workers made the rounds with wooden
paddles.
   The pace of change at Avery Island could pick up, of
course. Says Paul McIlhenny: "We've gotten more aggressive
than previously, and I think the next hundred years will see
us trying even more new things."
