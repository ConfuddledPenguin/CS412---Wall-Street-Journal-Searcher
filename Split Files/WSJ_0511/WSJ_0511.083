   MIAMI -- The TV newsman asks Jorge Mas Canosa a question
that is hotly debated all over this exile capital.
   Is it true, the commentator asks, that Mr. Mas Canosa, a
wealthy 49-year-old telephone-company contractor, plans to
succeed Fidel Castro?

   "I am not running for president of Cuba," snaps Mr. Mas
Canosa in his heavily accented English. Later, appearing on
local Spanish-language radio, Mr. Mas Canosa, a volatile
fellow who once challenged a Miami city commissioner to a
duel, lashes out at people who would ridicule him for
political ambitions he denies having:
   "The only thing Jorge Mas aspires to is the liberty of
Cuba." (Like some kings and presidents, he has a tendency to
refer to himself in the third person.)
   Until lately, few would have cared one way or the other
about Mr. Mas Canosa's political future, even though the
businessman is also chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, a powerful Washington-based exile lobby, to which
he devotes most of his time. The Castro succession has been
beside the point for the 31 years Fidel has been unassailably
in power. But suddenly, in the bright glare of perestroika,
the 63-year-old Mr. Castro is looking increasingly
vulnerable. If change can come to the Communist bloc in
Eastern Europe, then why not to a Soviet satellite off the
coast of Florida?
   Mr. Castro's overthrow may prove to be just the latest
exile pipe dream but, in Miami at least, the struggle for
power in post-Castro Cuba is going at full tilt.
   And of the many would-be "Senores Presidentes" who live
and scheme in this conspirators' heaven, Mr. Mas Canosa -- a
slight, extraordinarily energetic man with connections in
Washington, not to mention a penchant for hot rhetoric and a
blue, bulletproof Mercedes-Benz -- is widely seen as the most
ambitious of them all.
   "People of my generation don't talk about being president,
they act like the president," says a director of the
foundation, who suggests that Mr. Mas Canosa, despite his
protestations to the contrary, really is after Mr. Castro's
job and is, therefore, trying to act the part. Like many
others interviewed for this story, the director didn't want
to be identified.
   On April 28, Mr. Mas Canosa excoriated Fidel and lavishly
praised Ronald Reagan for 16 minutes before 20,000
flag-waving Cuban exiles gathered at the Orange Bowl to hear
a speech by Mr. Reagan, decked out for the occasion in his
"guayabera", a shirt typical of the Caribbean. "Americans and
Cubans together again will gain the liberty and independence
of Cuba," Mr. Mas Canosa told the excited crowd, in a speech
that was broadcast to Cuba on the U.S. Information Agency's
Radio Marti.
   In the past few months, Mr. Mas Canosa has toured Eastern
Europe, meeting with presidents and prime ministers. He was
accompanied by Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political
prisoner and author, who, though he barely speaks English, is
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
   Florida's governor, Bob Martinez, recently named Mr. Mas
Canosa chairman of the state's "Free Cuba" commission, which
is to advise the governor on the economic and social impact
on South Florida of Mr. Castro's prospective fall.
   Mr. Mas Canosa and the foundation have been busy writing a
constitution for a hypothetical Cuban provisional government.
Mr. Mas Canosa says he has hired Nobel laureate economist
Milton Friedman, at a fee of between $100,000 and $150,000,
to draw up plans for the Cuban economy post-Castro. (Mr.
Friedman denies that rather emphatically: "They asked me if I
would be willing to head up the study, and I said no. . . . I
haven't received a penny, nor do I have any expectation of
receiving a penny. . . .")
   In a small broadcast booth crowded with supporters, Mr.
Mas Canosa tells a talk-show audience that Arthur Laffer,
"the guy who invented the Laffer curve," is also on the team.
Mr. Laffer confirms that he is. His mission: to draw up a
list of Fortune 500 companies eager to invest in a free Cuba.
The exiles take it for granted that Cuba after Castro will be
free and that it may well find its new leader in Miami. With
a confident sweep of his arm, Mr. Mas Canosa explains that
Cuba will need little U.S. aid, as he and the foundation have
plans to raise maybe $19 billion in the international bond
market.
   Some anti-Castro exiles accuse Mr. Mas Canosa of
machinations in Washington fostering his presidential
aspirations in Havana. Ernesto Betancourt, the former head of
Radio Marti, says, in particular, that in March Mr. Mas
Canosa cost him his job.
   Mr. Mas Canosa heads President Bush's advisory board on
Radio Marti and is ardent about the new TV Marti operation,
which broadcasts to Cuba. Mr. Betancourt was opposed to the
very idea of it, arguing that Cuba could turn it to its
advantage in its propaganda war with the U.S. by jamming the
signal. And so, Mr. Betancourt says, Mr. Mas Canosa plotted
to have him removed. Actually, Mr. Betancourt was offered a
job transfer that he refused to take. He quit instead.
   He says Mr. Mas Canosa wants to use the broadcast
operation to hype his presidential aspirations with the Cuban
people. Mr. Betancourt believes, he says, that his removal
"was a "coup d'etat" to get control of transmissions, with
Mas being in the background." Mr. Mas Canosa strongly denies
the characterization, and the USIA says its offer of a job
transfer to Mr. Betancourt had nothing to do with Mr. Mas
Canosa.
   In Miami, Mr. Mas Canosa is admired for his relentless
dedication to the anti-Castro cause. But many exiles, and
even some close associates of his, see in Mr. Mas Canosa
authoritarian, anti-democratic impulses. In his radio
appearances, he bitterly attacks opponents, using the same
sort of strident rhetoric -- albeit from the right -- that
Mr. Castro employs to intimidate. Recently, he denounced a
group of university professors in Miami with whom he
disagreed as "close to Castro," despite their weakness for
"McDonald's hamburgers and Burger King."
   One measure of the fear in which Mr. Mas Canosa is held is
that many people who condemn him roundly in private are
unwilling to criticize him on the record. Some people compare
his personality to Mr. Castro's. Raul Masvidal, a founder of
the foundation who quit in 1985, says Mr. Mas Canosa as a
leader is "paternalistic and authoritarian. That's what we
have with Castro."
   Mr. Mas Canosa rejects the comparison. He says that he is
opposed to dictatorships of all sorts and that he has spent
his whole career fighting for democracy. He notes, however,
that when attacked, he is combative.
   Cubans are "absolutists" who consider leaders either weak
or dictatorial, he says. "I am in the middle." And as for the
fear of criticizing the foundation, he admits that some do
think twice before speaking out. "People fear the social
pressure because the foundation has a great deal of respect
in the community."
   At his office desk in a warehouse-district building here,
a fat stack of phone messages has piled up during a two-day
absence. He says he spends about 90% of his time on Cuba, 10%
tending to his business, which specializes in laying
telephone cable for Southern Bell. (He also has a tractor
dealership.) "The main objective of the Cuban government is
to defame the foundation and my person," Mr. Mas Canosa tells
a visitor darkly. "There is a conspiracy against the
foundation and against me."
   Mr. Mas Canosa's power lies in his close control of the
Cuban American National Foundation, which has an associated
though legally distinct lobbying group, and a
political-action committee that in the 1988 election gave
$182,897 to 56 U.S. House and Senate candidates, Democrats as
well as Republicans. The foundation's board is top-heavy with
Miami's newly rich Cuban business elite. "It's a business
oligarchy, which has delegated political decisions to Jorge,"
says Jose Antonio Font, a former executive director of the
foundation.
   The group has more than 50 directors, who each pony up at
least $10,000 a year in order to serve. Trustees, about 40
individuals, pay half that. And in the past three years, to
shed its elitist image the organization has signed up some
6,000 individual members, contributing as little as $5 per
month each.
   The foundation has scored a number of coups in Washington.
It got Radio Marti on the air. Then lobbying by the
foundation was instrumental in lifting a congressional ban on
U.S. aid to Jonas Savimbi's anti-Communist guerrillas, who
were fighting Cuban troops in Angola. The foundation has
brought to the U.S., with the blessings of the Reagan and
Bush administrations, 2,400 Cubans who had been stranded in
third countries. And, in March, TV Marti (whose broadcast
signal Cuba promptly jammed) began its trial run. The
foundation (in other words, Jorge Mas Canosa) powerfully
influences U.S. Cuba policy.
   Mr. Mas Canosa himself left Cuba as a student in 1960. He
trained for the failed, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion but his
boat never reached the beach. He worked as a milkman in Miami
and some customers still remember him today, for his
punctuality and because he was always talking about Cuba.
   Mr. Mas Canosa was commissioned a second lieutenant in the
U.S. Army, but resigned his commission and joined an
anti-Castro group. As the exiles' activity waned, Mr. Mas
Canosa worked at various jobs before establishing himself in
a business career. Ultimately, he bought an electrical
contracting company, which today has about 600 employees and
is a major subcontractor for the local unit of BellSouth
Corp.
   Although Mr. Mas Canosa sometimes affects the image of a
suave Washington mover, he is still in many ways the
prototypical, fiery exile politician with streetfighter
instincts.
   To wit: In 1986, Mr. Mas Canosa in a radio appearance
challenged Miami's city commissioner at the time, Joe
Carollo, to a duel. His choice of weapons: firearms. Mr.
Carollo had torpedoed a $130 million real-estate development
deal involving Mr. Mas Canosa, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick and others.
   "I am going to prove to the Cubans that you are a clown
and a coward," Mr. Mas Canosa pledged on the air. "Your
bullying in Miami has ended because you have encountered a
man, with a capital M, a very big M."
   Mr. Carollo replied that Mr. Mas Canosa might cool off if
the duel were held with water pistols. No duel was fought,
but Mr. Mas Canosa believes that his challenge served its
purposes, tarnishing Mr. Carollo's macho image with
Cuban-American supporters. Whatever the truth of that, Mr.
Carollo was defeated in the next election -- by a candidate
backed by foundation directors' money.
   At times, Mr. Mas Canosa seems still to be part of the
secretive world of exile conspiracies. In 1988, for instance,
he told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that leaders of a
rival Cuban exile group were planning to kill him. That
charge was groundless, says Hubert Matos Jr., one of the men
he accused. Mr. Matos says he immediately requested and
passed an FBI polygraph test. "He {Mr. Mas Canosa} had no
reason to go to the FBI," Mr. Matos asserts. "It's a way of
hurting a person's reputation. All he had to do was to call
me on the telephone."
   In 1987, Mr. Mas Canosa received a mysterious manila
envelope in the mail, which a Miami police dog agreed was
suspicious. Mr. Mas Canosa took to the airwaves to say he
suspected that agents of Mr. Castro had sent him a bomb.
(Indeed, another prominent Cuban-American had recently been
sent an explosive device.) The Miami City Commission quickly
offered a $25,000 reward for information. But the bomb squad
eventually defused the effort. The package contained a
videotape, nothing more, no bomb.
   Does Mr. Mas Canosa still feel he is in danger? "Of
course," he says, "When you hurt an assassin like Castro, you
have to be careful."
   Mr. Mas Canosa says that in the matter of the
assassination threat he reported to the FBI, he acted on what
he thought was good and sufficient information. "I have only
one life," he says.
   Over the years, Mr. Mas Canosa has fought a running battle
with the Miami Herald over its coverage of the foundation,
and of Cuban affairs generally. He has considered trying to
start a competing newspaper. In 1987, the foundation took out
a full-page ad in the Herald criticizing the Herald.
   Last year, at the foundation's annual Washington meeting,
there was a discussion about condemning the Herald, or even
of boycotting it. Armando Codina, a director, objected.
Suddenly, Mr. Mas Canosa grabbed the microphone, shouting,
"No more discussions]" Then, according to someone present,
Mr. Mas Canosa moved to condemn the Herald, saying that all
those who agreed should stand up. Everyone stood except Mr.
Codina, who confirms that the incident took place. "I had a
difference of opinion, and it was discussed," says Mr.
Codina.
   Mr. Mas Canosa says a boycott was never suggested and that
while a resolution condemning the Herald was considered, it
did not pass.
   ---
   In Miami, some suspect Mr. Mas Canosa is hoping that blood
will be shed in Cuba and that the U.S. will intervene. At
that point, they believe, Mr. Mas Canosa would maneuver to be
installed president by the force of U.S. arms. "Jorge is
desperately looking for the Marines," says Mr. Masvidal.
   Not so, insists Mr. Mas Canosa. He wants no U.S.
intervention and a nonviolent solution to the Cuban problem.
As he puts it, it doesn't seem to be much of a problem:
"Castro is a dead man," he confidently tells a college class
on leadership. "We are negotiating now what kind of funeral
he will have."
