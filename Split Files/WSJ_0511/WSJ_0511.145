   World oil prices held firm despite widespread expectation
that a technical correction would follow Wednesday's sizzling
rally.
   In European spot markets, North Sea crudes generally were
up five cents to 10 cents a barrel. In the U.S. futures
market, active trading pushed West Texas Intermediate crude
for June delivery up more than 30 cents a barrel, suggesting
at one point a possible repeat of Wednesday's gain of 71
cents a barrel.

   But the June crude contract failed to go higher than
$19.31 a barrel, and profit-taking in late trading brought it
back from there. Still, it settled at $19.02, up three cents,
while July delivery West Texas was up four cents to $19.48 a
barrel.
   Traders generally cited three factors for the gains: the
impact of labor troubles in North Sea oil fields, the
emerging demand for "sweet" low-sulfur crudes with the big
gasoline season near, and a growing belief among oil-market
participants that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will honor last week's agreement to cut
output by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day.
   "There is a definite change in sentiment on that
agreement," said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy
futures broker.
   The OPEC agreement was initially greeted skeptically in
world oil markets. But several leading OPEC members have
since given strong signals of plans to do their part to
implement the agreement.
   Among the more vocal in making such pledges have been
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Nigeria and Indonesia. In
Iraq, an oil ministry official said yesterday that Issam
Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, will go to
Riyadh tomorrow to meet with Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, on the OPEC efforts.
   Mr. Nazer has been in the U.S. since last weekend for a
meeting in New York of the board of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and
to visit facilities of Star Enterprise, the Saudi venture
with Texaco Inc. He was to return to Saudi Arabia after a
trip to New Orleans yesterday. But before leaving Geneva,
where OPEC held its meeting, Mr. Nazer told reporters he
already had informed Saudi customers to expect cuts.
   Saudi Arabia and two other major Persian Gulf producers,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have been in the
limelight since oil prices began falling sharply some weeks
ago because each has been producing well beyond its OPEC
quota. Indeed, the three should account for the bulk of the
reductions called for in the OPEC pact.
   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Abu
Dhabi, the chief member of the United Arab Emirates, has
asked several of its contract buyers to reduce the amount of
crude oil they plan to take this month. It wasn't immediately
clear, however, whether the reductions would total as much as
the 200,000 barrels a day that Mana Said Otaiba, the
emirates' oil minister, pledged to cut.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices edged higher. The May contract,
which will cease trading on May 29, rose 1.30 cents a pound
to $1.2570. July advanced 0.90 cent a pound to $1.1840.
During trading, both contracts established fresh
life-of-contract highs, May at $1.2710 and July at $1.1925.
The premiums of nearer positions over more deferred ones
continued to widen in New York and London. New York tended to
reflect the strength in London, where there was active demand
for copper from merchants, an analyst said. In Peru, there
was still concern that workers at Centromin, which is a major
Peruvian mining firm but a relatively minor copper producer,
may walk out. Also in Peru, labor negotiations are continuing
between Southern Peru Copper Corp. and unions, even though
employees have returned to work after an eight-week strike.
Both developments created uncertainty that was reflected in
firmer prices, an analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures rose while gold and
platinum eased. July delivery silver finished 5.7 cents an
ounce higher at $5.15. June gold retreated $1.80 an ounce to
$371.90. July platinum declined $1.90 an ounce to $484.60.
There has been sporadic demand from the Far East for silver
over the past month, an analyst said. As a result, demand for
futures contracts pushed prices higher, he said. The July
silver contract thrust above the key resistance level of
$5.11 and, when resting buying orders were touched off, the
rally ran up to $5.18 before receding, the analyst said.
Platinum at first was firm on some demand for the metal in
Japan, but later slipped in sympathy with gold, the analyst
said. Separately, the Silver Institute, a Washington,
D.C.-based industry group, announced that it had retained CPM
Group, a New York precious metals research company, to
produce the World Silver Survey, an annual review of the
international silver market, to be published later this year.
John Lutley, executive director of the institute, noted that
the gold and platinum industries have authoritative sources
of figures, but that similar sources of silver information
had disappeared as a result of a decline in trading of the
metal in recent years. "The gold industry has Consolidated
Gold Fields, which spends a half-million {pounds sterling}
annually and sends an army of people around the world to
gather information on gold, and platinum has Johnson Matthey,
another major international firm, which collects facts and
figures and analyzes the platinum market in depth," he said.
CPM Group, whose managing director is Jeffrey M. Christian,
is expected to fill that gap in silver, Mr. Lutley said.
