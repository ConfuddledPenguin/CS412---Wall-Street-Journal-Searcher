   Delegates attending the annual assembly of World Health
Organization today have a rare and remarkable opportunity to
make a difference to the poor. Yet it will be a frustrating
task. The seemingly straightforward path that connects WHO to
the compelling health needs of the poorest countries makes a
wide detour. That detour is through myriad programs,
meetings, and activities, all aimed at pursuing WHO's
open-ended definition of health as complete physical, social
and mental well-being for all. With 22 different functions in
its constitution, ranging from scientific cooperation to
public opinion, WHO has the option to be involved in any
international issue from bugs to bombs. And it has exercised
that option.
   In 1990, WHO has budgeted resources for 356 technical
activities. But many of these resources are allocated to
their administration. For example, nearly half of WHO's
regional efforts are consumed by organizing and
administrating. By one calculation of staff time spent in
Africa, 4% of that time is spent on disease prevention, 4% on
human-resource development and 65% on administration.

   The 1990-91 WHO budget totals $1.4 billion, but because of
a bias toward global and regional programs, funds that can be
spent at the country level are a tiny portion of the total
budget. The monies allocated to country-level activities in
the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa amount to only 7.9% and
7.3%, respectively, of the total budget. South and East Asia,
which include such desperately poor countries as Bangladesh
and Nepal, receive only 5.6% of the total funds. The nations
of the Western Pacific, including such poor countries as
Kiribati and Vanuatu, receive only 3.4% of the total budget.
   Resources trickling down to the countries most in need
have at times become a ludicrously small portion of WHO
expenditures. For example, WHO is spending less than
one-tenth of one percent of its $1.4 billion budget on
malaria control programs in Africa. Funding for
accident-prevention programs in the 34 countries of the
Western Pacific amounts to only $5,000 per year, or $147 per
country. The budget for programs to ensure drug and vaccine
safety and efficacy in Africa is merely $6,000. This amount
is budgeted for 46 nations for two years and translates into
$65 per country per year.
   In the countries of Southeast Asia, WHO's budget to
confront the leading killer of children, acute respiratory
infections, is just $500,000 over the next two years.
Estimates place the number of Southeast Asian children
between the ages of one and four at 34 million in 1990. This
means that WHO can contribute less than a penny per child to
fight the prime childhood killer in Southeast Asia.
   Not only are the portions of the budget allocated to
country activities in the poorest countries meager, but in
addition, the poorest countries did not receive any real
budget increases in 1990-91 compared to the 1988-89 period.
Yet, every single European nation received a real increase.
   It is true that the European nations receive a small
proportion of total resources and that their allotment is
tiny on a per capita basis. Yet, it amounts to $50 million of
WHO's scarce resources. If applied to country-level programs,
this amount could nearly double the regular budget
allocations for Africa. One might question not only the
critical need but also the relative ability of Europeans to
finance their own health-care programs. On average, European
governments spend $642 per person on health care, compared to
about $9 per capital in the low-income countries.
   Layers of bureaucracy have clouded what should be clear
priorities for WHO. Many activities have absolutely no
relevance to the people with the greatest needs. For
instance, of what possible relevance to people in needy
countries such as Ethiopia or Bhutan is the development of
essential drug lists for civilian aircraft in flight?
Incomprehensibly, the budget shows that the poorest countries
with the greatest health problems receive less support from
WHO than some of the more wealthy ones. Africa, for example,
receives only 16% of WHO's budget from all sources.
   Ethiopia, the poorest country in the world, has been
allocated 10 cents per person for 1990-91 (combining the
regular budget with other sources), or the princely sum of 5
cents per person per year. Bangladesh, Tanzania and
Mozambique are in much the same boat. Indeed, for the poorest
nations, the annual per-capita country allocation hardly ever
exceeds 25 cents. Yet, WHO provides twice as many
country-level resources per capita to Saudi Arabia and
Singapore as it does to Ethiopia.
   The problems of the poorest countries are not considered
in program design. Seventy-five percent of the African
countries could find use only for five of the 50 different
programs offered by WHO. Ironically, the most frequently
requested program for Africa, human resource development, was
the only one to receive a budget cut.
   WHO has chosen to emphasize its role of international
interlocutor for all manner of health concerns. But WHO must
reevaluate its mission. The existing WHO charter provides the
organization with the authority to shift and narrow its
focus. It should respond to the challenges of today in a
straightforward priority fashion that will expand its
effectiveness.
   Second, in shifting its focus, WHO must turn to the
neediest. Stretching its resources across all its members has
limited the funds available to improve the grave health
problems of the poorest. Perhaps it is time to declare Europe
re-built and apply its $50 million allocation to Africa.
   Third, WHO staff must peel away the levels of bureaucracy
and get closer to the members. By allocating resources among
the poorest countries and relocating technical personnel to
the field, WHO may learn what the real needs are. Action
should take place in the countries, not at WHO headquarters
in Geneva.
   Last, let demand determine supply. Defining the specific
activities of WHO should be the job of the membership, the
ministers of health and finance from developing countries,
not the Geneva Secretariat, international activists or
influential European countries. WHO should also take the
unprecedented step of eliminating programs that no country
wants.
   Delegates to the World Health Assembly should insist that
the next two-year WHO budget be designed to bridge the
health-care chasm between the rich and poor nations of the
world. Surely WHO delegates can break down the layers of
bureaucracy and the manifold interests that have constrained
the organization's potential to do the most good.
