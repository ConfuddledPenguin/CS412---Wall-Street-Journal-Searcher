   CHICAGO -- The undercover federal agent who posed as a
Swiss franc futures trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
was a rank amateur who once dropped his deck of trading cards
and temporarily "lost" orders in his own pocket, said an
attorney for Robert Mosky, one of three futures traders on
trial here for allegedly defrauding customers.
   Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent Randall Jannett was
depicted by attorneys for all three accused traders in their
opening agruments as being insufficiently trained to
understand the complex and chaotic activity in a futures
trading pit. As a result, the evidence gathered by the
neophyte trader, including secret tape-recordings, doesn't
support the government's allegations that Mr. Mosky and
co-defendants Danny Scheck and David Zatz stole trading
profits from customers, the attorneys said.

   Agent Jannett was "confused, incompetent, or something in
the middle," maintained Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky's attorney.
   The trial of the Swiss franc traders is expected to last
about six weeks, and will be followed in September by trials
of Japanese yen futures and soybean futures traders from the
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, respectively. These
traders are among the 48 individuals indicted last year on
the two exchanges and charged with stealing from customers.
   The FBI agent posed as a Swiss franc futures trader from
February through December of 1988 in order to gather evidence
of alleged wrongdoing. On April 14 of that year, the day he
dropped his order deck and lost orders in his pocket, his
hidden tape recorder gathered incriminating evidence against
him, not other traders, the attorneys said.
   Swiss franc futures prices were fluctuating wildly that
day, and the tape of the agent "captured the voice of a man
out of control, totally lost in the midst of a commodity
pit," said Harvey Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney.
   Mr. Silets pointed out that four of the five disputed
trades that form the basis for the felony counts against his
client occurred during Agent Jannett's first two and a half
months in the pit. Mr. Silets asserted that the agent wasn't
adequately schooled in commodity trading by that point to be
a reliable witness to trades.
   The U.S. attorney's office, and not just the FBI, has a
shaky understanding of futures trading, asserted Alan
Blumenthal, Mr. Zatz's attorney. He pointed out that when
assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack made his opening remarks
to the jury Wednesday, he incorrectly described Chicago Merc
trading rules governing the circumstances under which traders
can make bids and offers in the trading pit.
   Mr. Blumenthal emphasized the small amount of money
involved in the disputed trades that form the basis of the
felony counts against his client. Four of the six disputed
trades resulted in profits to Mr. Zatz of $50 or less for
each trade, Mr. Blumenthal said.
   He also attempted to disparage the evidence against the
traders that will be presented by two other Swiss franc
traders, Mark Fuhrman and William Walsh. They were caught
stealing from customers by the agent, pleaded guilty and
agreed to testify against the traders on trial in expectation
of relatively light sentences.
   "That was the best futures trade those guys ever made,"
Mr. Blumenthal quipped.
