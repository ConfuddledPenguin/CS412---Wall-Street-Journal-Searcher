   The powerful role of boxing promoters is about to face a
stiff challenge in court.
   Heavyweight champion James "Buster" Douglas, in a trial
set to begin Monday, is directing his legal blows at Don
King, the famous fight promoter. What's at stake, beyond the
careers of Messrs. King and Douglas, is the validity of the
widely used contracts that endow promoters with the muscle to
dictate where and whom their boxers fight.

   A top promoter such as Mr. King may invest as much as
$600,000 to $1 million to advance a fighter's career from his
first professional bout to the hoped-for championship
(although Mr. King rarely works with a fighter just starting
out). The promoter guarantees a boxer's salary, pays his
expenses for training and travel, and supplies free tickets.
In turn, the promoter gets all or a cut of television and
ticket revenue and all merchandising rights.
   For a boxer such as Mr. Douglas, the catch is that the
promoter cushions his own risk by signing the fighter to
long-term contracts that prohibit the boxer from dealing with
other promoters. And since multimillion-dollar fight purses
rarely go to anyone but champions, smart promoters wangle
exclusive rights to control a contender's career for several
fights after a championship bout.
   That's the subject of the bitter legal dispute between
champion boxer and champion promoter. Mr. King says he is
backed solidly by American contract law, and many legal
experts agree.
   Last year, Mr. Douglas signed a contract with Mr. King
that covered the title fight and three subsequent bouts. The
contract, the latest in a series between the fighter and
promoter, gave Mr. King the right to negotiate the package
for each fight. Mr. Douglas could get out of the contract if
he were to be paid less than $1 million per bout.
   That kind of payday was highly unlikely for Mr. Douglas, a
journeyman fighter who wasn't considered championship
material. But Mr. Douglas accomplished the improbable by
beating then-undefeated heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in
February. Mr. King offered the new champ $11 million for his
first title defense, a hefty payday but not as much as Mr.
Douglas -- newly acquainted with television interviews,
magazine covers and home-town parades -- had in mind.
   An offer by Mirage Casino Hotel owner Steve Wynn was more
like it: He promised Mr. Douglas $25 million, part of a $60
million package for the rights to stage and promote two
fights at the casino in Las Vegas. Exclusive contracts such
as Mr. King's are prohibited in Nevada, and Mr. Wynn wants
the glamour fights so he can draw high rollers to his
gambling tables. Since Mr. Wynn upped the ante, other
promoters have attempted to woo Mr. Douglas with prospects of
as much as $50 million for a rematch with Mr. Tyson.
   In an effort to invalidate the King contract and gain the
freedom to negotiate with others, Mr. Douglas filed suit in
Las Vegas in February. In his complaint, Mr. Douglas contends
that he had to swallow Mr. King's terms or lose a shot at the
heavyweight championship. Mr. King had all the bargaining
power because he held the promotional rights to Mr. Tyson,
then the champion, the suit maintains. "Why should we have to
take less money?" asks John Johnson, Mr. Douglas's manager.
"Don't we have a right to say yes or no?"
   Mr. Douglas also contends that Mr. King breached the
contract when he took Mr. Tyson's side in a dispute over the
outcome of their Tokyo title fight.
   Mr. King has countersued in federal court in New York. He
is asking for more than $25 million in damages from Mr.
Douglas for breach of contract, and he seeks a court order to
stop a proposed September fight at the Mirage Casino. He's
also asking for more than $50 million from Mr. Wynn for
allegedly interfering with his contract with Mr. Douglas.
   Mr. Douglas's suit has become a rallying point for those
who denounce exclusive contracts as a form of indentured
servitude that unfairly enriches the promoters. These critics
say it's common for promoters to reap 20% and more of a
fight's revenue while the boxer's salary can amount to less
than 10%. When the promoter controls both contestants, as Mr.
King often does, he takes home twice as much for the same
work.
   A victory for Mr. Douglas might encourage a host of boxers
to tear up their contracts with promoters and enter a new era
of free agency in which they could negotiate terms on a
fight-by-fight basis. It would also weaken the flamboyant Mr.
King's powerful hold on the industry. For more than a decade,
Mr. King has had contracts with either the leading contenders
or the champion, or both, in the heavyweight division, which
commands the most prize money.
   Lawyers who deal with contracts such as Mr. Douglas's,
however, caution that exclusive agreements are generally
enforced by courts. John Sahl, who teaches sports and
entertainment law at the University of Bridgeport (Conn.),
says that such contracts are common in the boxing business
and haven't been ruled as any different than similar
arrangements in the recording industry. Personally, he says,
he views them as inherently unfair but says they are probably
not illegal.
   "They're not fighting me," says Mr. King. "They're
fighting American contract law." He insists that his
contracts are fair because they reward the promoter's risk
while giving fighters with no other backing the opportunity
to get a shot at the title. He adds that boxers do well under
the promotional contracts; he says he has negotiated paydays
of $1 million or more for about 15 fighters.
   "Buster Douglas is the best living example of the risk a
promoter takes in investing in a fighter," Mr. King says.
Indeed, before the Tyson fight, Mr. Douglas was nobody's idea
of a hot property. During his nine-year career, the Columbus,
Ohio, native compiled a 29-4-1 record but sometimes came to
fights overweight and fought listlessly. Mr. Johnson, his
manager, says he was "too nice." His father and trainer,
Billy, a former middleweight boxer, forsook him after he quit
in his title fight against Tony Tucker in 1987.
   "Nobody was interested in Douglas," says Don Duva, the
promoter who represents top heavyweight contender Evander
Holyfield. "He was a non-entity."
   Mr. King says he invested in promoting Mr. Douglas as
early as 1984 and continued to do business with him because
he saw talent in him that others didn't. He also got a boxer
to use on the "undercard," preliminary bouts at big fights.
In August 1989, Mr. Douglas gave Mr. King control of possibly
two years of his career for a promise that Mr. Tyson, whom
Mr. King also represents, would fight him. Stephen Enz, the
attorney who represented Mr. Douglas at the time, says, "We
had other offers to consider, but the road to the
championship only ran through Don King. You have to deal with
Don King on his terms."
   But despite the claims from the Douglas corner, Mike
Trainer, a lawyer and manager of middleweight champion Sugar
Ray Leonard, points out that Mr. Douglas had an alternative:
fighting all the top contenders to qualify for a guaranteed
title fight under boxing association rules, with or without
Mr. King. "He could have . . . been declared a mandatory
contender," says Mr. Trainer, "Nobody put a gun to his head.
He didn't have to sign it."
   An important side issue in the lawsuits will involve Mr.
King's role in arguing before the World Boxing Association
that Mr. Douglas should have lost the Tyson bout because the
referee allowed him too much time to get up after he was
knocked down in the eighth round. Mr. Douglas knocked Mr.
Tyson out in the 10th round.
   The question will be whether Mr. King's fiduciary duty to
Mr. Douglas obligated him to muzzle himself. Some say Mr.
King did what the contract called for -- promote his fighter
-- and that was his only duty. Others say as a promoter for
both fighters, Mr. King had a duty to remain neutral.
   Most lawyers and promoters agree that, as in his last
fight, Mr. Douglas will be an underdog in the courtroom. And
just about everyone predicts that somehow Mr. King will still
be in the picture the next time Mr. Douglas puts on his
gloves.
   Mr. King agrees: "They said I'm a scalawag, a thief, a
rapscallion, yet I continue to survive."

             Heavyweight Slugfest in Court

                     Who Gets What
                                                                                                       

   Revenue from championship bouts is split differently at
each fight; a typical fight might break down this way:
                                                                                                       

   Split by two promoters              35%
   Host                                31%
   Champion                            20%
   Challenger                          14%
