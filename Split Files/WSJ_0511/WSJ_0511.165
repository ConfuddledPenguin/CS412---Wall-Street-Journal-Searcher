   Action Auto Stores Inc. said yesterday it will close 11 of
its 68 retail stores and report a loss for the fiscal third
quarter.
   The Flint, Mich., company, which is expected to report its
third-quarter earnings next week, earned $295,038, or 10
cents a share, in the January-to-March period a year ago. The
company didn't indicate how big the third quarter loss would
be, but company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James
Sabo said, "Our plans and projections indicate improvement"
in the coming quarters.

   After the 11 stores are shut, Action Auto will operate 57
stores in Michigan.
