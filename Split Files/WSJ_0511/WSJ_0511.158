   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange reported its
lowest earnings of the past five years.
   The Big Board said its net income in 1989 dropped 39% to
$6.3 million from $10.4 million in 1988. Revenue at the
exchange increased 7.9% to $349.3 million. But expenses
surged 12% to $339.2 million, partly because of an upgrading
of technology for trading and surveillance.

   To rein in expenses, the Big Board recently imposed a
hiring freeze and has tried to reduce costs and increase
certain fees. A spokeswoman declined to comment on hiring or
budgetary matters.
   The Big Board could face another profit squeeze this year.
The exchange had predicted that daily average volume would
amount to about 166 million shares this year. Through the end
of April, daily average volume on the Big Board amounted to
154.7 million. Lower trading volume generally cuts into the
exchange's fee income.
   Nonetheless, there are plenty of signs that the exchange
remains vital. Some 41.6 billion shares traded at the Big
Board last year, the second highest volume in the exchange's
history. The number of listed companies rose to 1,721, an
all-time high.
   However, return on members' equity fell to 2.7%, the
second year of low, single-digit returns. Working capital at
the exchange fell to $108.9 million from $114 million in
1988.
   At the American Stock Exchange, net income rose 64% to
$4.2 million in 1989 from $2.6 million the previous year.
Revenue at the Amex rose 6.7% to $109.6 million from $102.7
million in 1988, partly because of gains in transaction and
clearance charges. Expenses grew 3.6% to $102.8 million last
year from $99.2 million in 1988.
   The Amex traded 3.1 billion shares last year, the second
highest share volume ever, compared with 2.5 billion in 1988.
A center of options trading, the Amex traded 49.8 million
stock options contracts, up from 45 million in 1988.
   "The outlook for 1990 is good," said James Jones, Amex
chairman. He said first-quarter net income was $1.2 million,
while trading volume in the period was up 31% from a year
earlier.
