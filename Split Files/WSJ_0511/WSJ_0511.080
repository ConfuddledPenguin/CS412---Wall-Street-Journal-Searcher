   FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS now the nation's greatest killer
has been giving ground, grudgingly at first but now with
increasing speed, before an onslaught by modern medicine and
technology. But this very success has bred a problem all its
own, a problem of alternatives.
   The killer is coronary-artery disease, which still takes a
half-million lives annually, and the problem is this: With
every refinement and new advance in its treatment, doctors
and patients alike now have choices they never had before --
agonizing ones. The result has been increasing tension over
treatment options, particularly between cardiologists and
surgeons, and more anxiety and doctor-shopping among patients
whose lives depend on making the right decision.

   Granted, this is not the worst problem they could have.
Nobody would want to go back to, say, the mid-60s, when a
diagnosis of substantial artery disease was, as one physician
puts it, "tantamount to a death sentence." Little could be
done. The patient might die tomorrow, next month, next year,
10 years from now -- but he would die early unless something
else killed him even earlier.
   Since then, millions of lives have been saved and greatly
extended by the principal developments of the past couple of
decades: cardiac bypass surgery, angioplasty, and new drug
regimens. But though these are impressive statistics, heart
disease is not about statistics. It is about the individual
patient and his doctor groping for answers to two universal
questions:
   What is the best way to treat this particular case? What
should I do to save my life?

   In Hanover, N.H., the operating room at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center resonates with the harsh
buzz of a hand-held jigsaw as cardiac surgeon Stephen Plume
cuts open the chest of a 67-year-old man. Soon, three clear
plastic tubes connecting the patient's heart to a nearby
heart-lung machine turn a deep crimson; the patient's blood
is now being pumped from outside his body. Moments later, a
technician turns a valve sending a potassium-based solution
directly to the heart. It stops cold.
   This is coronary-artery bypass graft surgery, in which a
vein from another part of the patient's body will be used to
create an alternative route around fat-clogged portions of
his coronary arteries. Untreated, the arteries would clog
completely or get plugged by a blood clot, triggering a heart
attack.
   Bypass surgery is the ultimate, most invasive and -- to
patients --  the most frightening of all treatments for
coronary-artery disease. For almost 15 years after its
inception in 1968, it was also the only one available to
severe cases. Their choice was simple then: Have the surgery
or die.
   That changed a decade ago with the advent of angioplasty,
a safer and less invasive procedure (but in some ways a less
effective one). With angioplasty, a needle-thin catheter is
threaded into the heart's arteries and a balloon at its tip
is inflated, squashing the fatty deposits flat against the
artery walls and allowing a freer flow of blood through them.
Suddenly, there were two choices on the treatment menu.
   And all along new drugs were being developed, and new uses
for old ones found. Today, 65% of newly diagnosed cases of
coronary disease are initially treated by drugs, and for a
good many of them drugs remain the only therapy prescribed.
   No heart drug clears obstructions from blood vessels. But
the beta-blocker compounds reduce the heart's workload, and
hence its need for oxygen that the diseased arteries can't
deliver. The calcium-channel antagonists keep narrowed
arteries from closing due to spasms, and simple aspirin is
now widely prescribed to prevent blood clots.
   Of course, for many patients, choosing among the three
treatment options -- surgery, angioplasty or drugs -- is
premature. The first thing doctors should do, says Eugene
Passamani, director of heart and vascular diseases at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is demand that
their patients reduce their heart-attack risk by changing
their behavior: Quit smoking, reduce weight, and lower blood
pressure and cholesterol levels. "Smokers have to be
admonished to stop smoking," says Dr. Passamani. "The data
are incontrovertible."
   But experienced cardiologists say they often know just by
talking to their patients that some treatment is needed.
"Patients take their fist and put it against their chest,"
says Gerald Weisfogel, a Metuchen, N.J., heart doctor. "When
they use that description, it really sets off bells. It's
classic angina" -- pain caused when clogged arteries block
blood flow to the heart.
   Prescribing treatment, however, is another matter. "At the
extremes, it's very easy," Dr. Passamani says. "A severely
diseased left main artery {which feeds the left ventricle,
the heart's pumping chamber} goes right to bypass. Mild
angina can be treated with medicine."
   That leaves a lot in between for doctors to disagree about
-- and a lot for patients to be confused about. Thomas Noto,
a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida, in Fort
Lauderdale, says: "When you show a surgeon a case of
significant coronary disease, there's only one cure for it:
surgery. When you show it to a cardiologist, there's only one
cure for it: angioplasty."
   Dr. Noto is admittedly exaggerating to make a point --
that surgeons like to cut, that cardiologists like to avoid
cutting, and that these ingrained biases sometimes affect
decision-making. A cardiologist he knows had a 42-year-old
male patient with blockage in three arteries -- making him,
says Dr. Noto, clearly a case for bypass. The cardiologist
sold him on angioplasty instead. While it was being done, the
patient went into shock and his heart muscle was damaged
before an emergency bypass, the backup procedure, could be
completed.
   "The patient's whole life expectancy was reduced," says
Dr. Noto. "This wasn't a malpractice thing, but it certainly
was bad judgment."
   As for patients, it's not surprising that when given a
choice, almost all will select angioplasty over bypass. In
the balloon technique, patients are sedated and awake rather
than anesthetized, they are not being torn open by surgical
saws, and they're in the hospital for just a day or two and
can return to work within five days. Only about 1% of
patients die during the procedure or soon after.
   By contrast, bypass patients generally spend 10 days or
more in the hospital and three months recuperating. Their
death rate is 2% at medical centers where surgical teams do a
large number of such operations, and can be far higher where
they don't. The cost is higher, too -- an average of $22,771,
against $9,138 for angioplasty, according to a study done at
Emory University in Atlanta.
   But there are hidden hazards and other drawbacks to
angioplasty. In 3% to 7% of cases, the vessel stretched open
by the balloon collapses spontaneously and a bypass has to be
done anyway, either immediately or promptly. (For this
reason, doctors say it is imperative that angioplasty be done
only in hospitals where heart surgeons are on standby.)
   Finally, in 30% of cases the arteries treated clog again
within six months. Only 10 weeks after his angioplasty,
Walter Hermann, a 43-year-old AT&amp;T employee from Piscataway,
N.J., felt a tightness in his chest while he was walking. "I
knew it had closed," he says. He had angioplasty again, with
the vessels opened wider than before, and has been free of
symptoms for two years though he jogs five miles a day.
   It isn't unusual to perform the balloon treatment even a
third time, but that's about the limit. Says cardiologist
Geoffrey Hartzler of the Mid-America Heart Institute in
Kansas City: "It isn't sane to do it every three or four
months. The time comes for surgery rather than keep flogging
it with the balloon."
   Surgeons, he adds, argue that with the high rate of
recurrence a bypass might as well be done in the first place.
Though the grafted vessels in that procedure often clog up,
too, the process generally takes years rather than a few
months.
   But variations on angioplasty are now being tested,
variations that promise to make the procedure longer-lasting.
They include tiny lasers that vaporize the fatty deposits
instead of just flattening them out, roto-rooter devices that
shave them away, and stents -- springy mesh coils that, left
inside the diseased artery by the angioplasty catheter,
expand against the artery walls to keep them open.
   This will certainly improve the therapy, but it will also
make the choices for doctors and patients even more complex.
Currently, there are no firm guidelines doctors can rely on
to determine which patients would be best served by which
treatment; studies are under way, but results are years off.
   Even experienced physicians find that treating heart
disease is often more art than science. "No two patients are
alike," says Charles Bush, director of the cardiac
catheterization laboratory at Ohio State University
Hospitals, Columbus. "What happens to their father or their
uncle or their neighbor isn't what's going to happen to them,
even if it sounds like exactly the same thing. That's what
makes this business very difficult."
   Fearing bypass even though their cases call for it, many
patients have to be talked out of angioplasty. When the
patient is elderly, the issue may be whether either procedure
is worth doing. Dr. Noto, the cardiologist from Fort
Lauderdale, says that the risk and the cost of bypass and
angioplasty often outweigh the benefits that, say, a
79-year-old might get. He believes many patients that age
should be treated with nothing but medication.
   "I spend as much time talking people out of getting
invaded as I do invading them," he says. "We're using up
resources with no regard whatever to their cost." In such
cases, he adds, not only medical judgment but ethical and
moral considerations must be involved in the treatment
decision.
   Such decisions are extraordinarily complex in any case
where the remedy is not clear-cut, as it frequently is not.
This is apparent at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Hanover, where cardiologists and heart surgeons meet every
Wednesday for a "cath conference" at which tough cases are
reviewed.
   One Wednesday they are watching films of an angiogram -- a
diagnostic procedure in which dye is injected into the
coronary arteries to reveal their condition -- taken on a
50-year-old saleswoman. Watching the dye course through her
arteries, the doctors see that in some places they are 70% to
90% blocked and look like twisted ribbon, each twist
representing a narrowed passage.
   But this is only one consideration. The doctors in Hanover
also factor into the risk-benefit equation such things as
age, weight, personal habits and health history, existence of
complicating diseases like diabetes, condition of the heart
muscle itself, and more.
   "She continues to smoke, she has high cholesterol, and has
a {negative} family history," a cardiologist reports. The
best he can say for her is that she doesn't have diabetes and
that she's trying to quit smoking. "I don't think she's a
candidate for angioplasty, but she wants something done," he
adds.
   Using a complex risk formula, surgeon Stephen Plume
calculates her risk of death during bypass at 7% to 10% --
far higher than the average 2% and more than he is
comfortable with. He is displeased that she is still smoking.
But she is only 50, and he says he is "uneasy" at ruling her
out. In the end, he puts her down for bypass.
   Another patient is 76, less than five feet tall, and
weighs 240 pounds. Looking at the films, a doctor murmurs,
"The LAD {left anterior descending artery, a critically
important vessel} looks like 10 miles of bad road."
   If she were younger or not obese, a bad LAD would probably
send her to bypass. But as it is, her risk of death on the
table is calculated at a sky-high 26%. "And what do we gain
even if we have a {successful} result at surgery?" one doctor
asks. Dr. Plume says, "We don't want to operate on her." The
cardiologists agree to try to open up her LAD with a balloon.
   These kinds of decisions are being made every week in
countless medical centers. But they are only preliminary
decisions; the patient must agree. And, with growing
frequency, anxious patients are demanding more information
from their doctors and more involvment in the whole process
of weighing treatment options.
   When they are dissatisfied, some of them go
doctor-shopping. Michael Tobin, a 47-year-old lawyer who had
had a bypass 10 years before, discovered last fall that his
arteries had become obstructed again. Told by his doctor that
he needed another bypass, he balked. "Being cut down the
middle of your chest is a big deal," he says. "I was
determined not to go through it again."
   Mr. Tobin personally sent his angiograms to five of the
nation's foremost balloon specialists, hoping at least one
would agree to try angioplasty. "They told me to forget it,"
he says. He looked into laser angioplasty but found that it
was still viewed as experimental.
   Mr. Tobin finally relented -- but only after he got Dudley
Johnson, the Milwaukee surgeon who was a bypass pioneer and
who specializes in difficult cases, to take his case. "Dr.
Johnson said my situation wasn't so complicated," says Mr.
Tobin, who is back at work in New Jersey following successful
surgery. "When he said that, I knew he was the one for me."
