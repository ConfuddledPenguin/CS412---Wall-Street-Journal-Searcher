   BOSTON -- A television station here said Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. canceled its ads at the station after it broadcast an
advertisement urging consumers to boycott P&amp;G's Folgers
coffee.
   The ad was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a national
organization based in San Francisco that advocates ending
U.S. investments in El Salvador. The group also is urging
consumers to boycott coffee made of beans grown in El
Salvador.

   The ad ends with an upturned coffee cup spilling what
appears to be blood and urges viewers to boycott Folgers. A
local branch of Neighbor to Neighbor paid Boston's WHDH-TV, a
CBS affiliate, $1,000 to run the ad, said Sy Yanoff,
president of the station.
   "We looked at the ad, and it met our standards for
commercial advertisements," Mr. Yanoff said. He added that a
P&amp;G official called the station Wednesday to discuss the
Neighbor to Neighbor ad but didn't say the company planned to
pull its ads.
   Then yesterday, "our representative in New York called and
said P&amp;G just canceled all its current ads at our station,"
Mr. Yanoff said. He added that P&amp;G spends about $1 million
annually on ads at the station.
   A spokesman for the Cincinnati-based consumer products
firm, confirming that P&amp;G had canceled its ads, said the
Neighbor to Neighbor commercial is "highly offensive." It
attacks P&amp;G and Folgers, "and that's not the type of ad
environment we want for our ads."
