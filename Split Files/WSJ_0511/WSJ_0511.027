   HONG KONG -- Stock prices aren't the only things that have
been falling on many Asian-Pacific markets.
   Trading activity has been shrinking, too, a fact many
analysts say indicates increasing uncertainty about where
regional share prices are headed for the rest of this year.

   Tokyo's market, which has been buffeted by a falling yen
and rising interest rates, has stabilized after sharp falls
earlier this year. The Nikkei stock average stands 22.5%
below its level at the end of last year. Volume, measured by
the average value of shares traded each day, dropped sharply
in March and April as investors waited for prices to
stabilize. In January, average daily turnover was about $6.5
billion; by April, the level had dropped 27% to about $4.8
billion.
   While many investors have focused on the travails of
Japanese shares, volume has been ebbing on many of the
region's other markets as well. Through April, the value of
shares traded on an average day was lower than the January
levels on six of 10 regional markets. Included on the list of
volume laggards were some of last year's stellar performers:
Singapore; Bangkok, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and
Taiwan, each of whose share prices rose at least 40% in 1989.
Also on the list were two underperformers: Australia, which
rose about 11% last year, and Seoul, South Korea, which had a
flat 1989.
   "Volumes on the whole are contracting," says David
Harding, a director at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. "You
can argue that that's bullish or bearish. There's no crash
around the corner, but people certainly are cautious."
   Fund managers and brokers agree that shrinking volumes
indicate growing investor uncertainty. There is no consensus,
however, about whether the slowing in volume signals a
decline or an increase in share prices.
   In a long-term bull market, falling prices accompanied by
light volume usually are a good sign. Investors refuse to
sell because they are confident that share prices will resume
their rise after a correction.
   For the most part, that is what has happened in the
developing markets of the Asian-Pacific region. Despite
periods of sharp corrections, share prices are far above
their levels of a decade ago. And between 1979 and 1989,
trading levels ballooned tremendously, so volume today
remains high by historical standards even if it is slacking
off in some markets.
   But in the late stages of bull markets, shrinking volume
and falling prices sometimes signal that investors are losing
confidence. Potential sellers hesitate because they are
hoping for a rebound. Potential buyers hold back because they
fear that share prices will fall further.
   The problem for investors is deciding whether the recent
contraction in trading indicates that a bear actually is
stalking regional markets. Most brokers and fund managers
think not. But many believe that prices on numerous exchanges
in the region are vulnerable to some wild swings,
particularly if trading picks up after the spate of regional
holidays that ended with last week's Golden Week in Japan.
   "Sustained declines on low volume mean that people are
holding stock they bought at higher prices," says Timothy
Moe, regional research director at Jardine Fleming Securities
Ltd. "That makes overhead resistance powerful because selling
pressure hasn't been vented."
   Analysts say share prices also are being restrained by a
muddled outlook for the world economy. Inflation and rising
interest rates are dogging the world's big economies, but
there is no convincing sign that any of them is sliding into
recession. Despite the Tokyo market's sharp fall this year,
Wall Street hasn't followed suit. Corporate earnings
world-wide are generally down, but enthusiasm is high for
European equities as Eastern Europe enters the capitalist
camp.
   "It amazes me the way people around the world focus on
different things," says Rick Schmidt, a broker at BT
Brokerage (Asia) Ltd. "Right now, it adds up to uncertainty
and a lack of interest in most Asian markets. There's nothing
to get excited about, so things sort of drift."
   Stewart Aldcroft, a director at Wardley Investment
Services Ltd., observes that the slackening volumes in some
markets are an indication that investors are content to sit
on their regional holdings despite an uncertain short-term
outlook.
   "It depends on the individual market," he says. "I
personally think any increase in volume is likely to be
positive for prices, but there is the outside chance that
investors will decide to dump stocks."
