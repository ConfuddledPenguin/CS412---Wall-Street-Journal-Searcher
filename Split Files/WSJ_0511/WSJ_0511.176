   Viacom Inc. posted strong first-quarter sales growth and a
net loss that was much narrower than the operating loss in
the year-ago period, when net income was boosted sharply by
one-time gains on sales of cable systems.
   Viacom's operating earnings more than doubled in its
cable-networks division, which includes MTV. Double-digit
revenue and earnings increases were posted in each of the
company's three other divisions: local cable systems; TV and
radio stations; and program production and syndication.

   The company posted a first-quarter loss of $17.1 million,
or 32 cents a share, on 15% growth in revenue, to $393.2
million. The year-ago period had revenue of $341.1 million,
an operating loss of $80.8 million and net income of $199.1
million, or $3.73 a share, thanks to a pretax profit boost of
$304.8 million from the sale of cable systems in Cleveland
and Long Island.
   Viacom also expanded its bank lines of credit in the
quarter by $200 million, to $1.7 billion, to add flexibility
in managing its debt load and in making small acquisitions,
said George S. Smith Jr., chief financial officer.
   The firm's cash flow improved considerably. In the most
recent period Viacom generated cash flow of $99 million to
cover interest payments of $70.8 million, some of which was
"in kind" rather than in actual cash. That compares with
year-earlier cash flow of $86 million to cover $96.1 million
in interest.
