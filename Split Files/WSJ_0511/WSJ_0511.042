   KIRKLAND, Wash. -- A huge gain on the sale of its
southeast cellular systems boosted McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc.'s first-quarter net income to $851.9
million, or $4.97 a share.
   That compares with a year-ago net loss of $97.7 million,
or 74 cents a share. Revenue increased 76% to $180 million
from $102 million in last year's first quarter.

   McCaw sold its southeast cellular systems to Contel
Cellular Inc. for a gain of about $1.16 billion. Results of
the most recent quarter also reflect completion of its tender
offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp., as well as an extraordinary
tax benefit of $157.8 million.
   Prior to the one-time gain on the asset sale, McCaw had a
loss for the period, including interest expense, of $96.6
million. A year ago, the comparable operating loss, plus
interest expenditures, totaled $102.5 million.
   McCaw also reported strong first-quarter rises in both
cash flow and customers. Cash flow rose sharply in the first
quarter to $31.4 million, compared with $4.3 million in last
year's first quarter. The number of cellular subscribers in
McCaw's markets increased 64% to 853,000 from 520,000 a year
ago. According to analysts, McCaw will need sustained sharp
growth over the next five years to pay off a huge debt burden
assumed in the acquisition of a controlling interest in LIN
Broadcasting.
