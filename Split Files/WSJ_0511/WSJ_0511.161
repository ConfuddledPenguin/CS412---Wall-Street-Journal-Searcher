   Citicorp's domestic problem loans could rise another $500
million to $600 million, or about 18%, by the end of the
year.
   Thomas E. Jones, executive vice president for financial
control, tax and auditing, said in an interview that
deteriorating conditions in commercial real estate markets
largely are responsible for the rise.

   He added that the $500 million to $600 million was based
largely on the New York-based bank's "feel" for where the
market is headed and isn't an estimate.
   Such an increase would be in line with Citicorp's
first-quarter results when nonperforming commercial real
estate loans rose to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion at the
end of 1989.
   As of March 31, Citicorp had $7.5 billion in nonperforming
loans out of a total portfolio of $160 billion. Of that,
about $3.3 million are domestic loans, including $1.3 billion
of problem loans on commercial real estate projects.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Citicorp rose 37.5 cents a share to close at $22.75.
