   PARIS -- Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine has budgeted 3
billion francs ($545 million) over the next three years to
improve its distribution network in France and increase
capacity for the production of high-octane gasoline, the
state-controlled oil group said.
   At the retail level, Elf plans to build 600 new service
stations and modernize another 900 outlets. In addition, some
2,700 stations, mostly in rural areas, will be improved.
