   MEXICO CITY -- Consumer prices rose 1.5% in April,
bringing the rise for the year to 10.8%, the central bank
said.
   The rate was the same as was registered in March, a Bank
of Mexico communique said. Prices on housing, milk,
restaurants, automobiles, airline tickets, hotels,
newspapers, beer and some foods were the biggest contributors
to the overall increase, the bank said. Declines in prices of
some vegetables and in electricity prices in cities that
apply summer rates helped compensate for some of the
increases, it said.
