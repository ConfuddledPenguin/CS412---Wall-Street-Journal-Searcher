   FREMONT, Mich. -- Gerber Products Co. says it expects to
exceed forecasts for the year ended March 31 by reporting
per-share earnings of about $2.50 from continuing operations.
   Alfred Piergallini, Gerber chairman and chief executive
officer, also predicted a 10% to 12% gain in per-share
earnings for the current first quarter as the company begins
what he sees as a year of improved margins and major product
development. He also anticipates another dividend increase
this summer.

   Last year, Gerber earned 70 cents a share for the period,
which would put the current quarter's range at 77 to 78
cents.
   For fiscal 1989, Gerber earned $81.3 million, or $2.07 a
share on a post-split basis, on sales of $1.07 billion.
Continuing operations results totaled $2.17 a share.
   For the year just ended, Mr. Piergallini said earnings
would be up between 25%-30%, before charges of 34 cents for
discontinued operations. That could put net income at $2.46 a
share or more.
   The higher-than-estimated results reflect what the company
calls a "very strong" fourth quarter for its Gerber baby-food
division, substantial improvement for its Buster Brown
children's apparel business, export volume gains and
cost-containment efforts that boosted margins throughout the
organization.
   Mr. Piergallini said Gerber's major financial goals all
appear easily achievable: 24% return on equity, which should
be "surpassed nicely;" cash flow from operations of at least
15% of revenue, and real earnings growth of 6% to 8%.
   Gerber Products soon will test-market about two dozen
"transitional food" items aimed at children 12 to 36 months
old, Mr. Piergallini said.
   The line, which would bear the Gerber name, is likely to
include side dishes, fruit and vegetable snacks, cookies and
other bakery snacks, juice drinks, puddings and ready-to-eat
cereals, he said. Gerber sees incremental sales of between
$100 million and $150 million in the $1 billion toddler-food
market.
   "If everything goes well," Mr. Piergallini said, Gerber
would be rolling out products as early as next spring.
Initially the company is using co-packers, but the chief
executive said "it's my intention to bring them into the
company if the concept is successful."
   To win sales, the line will focus on nutrition as well as
products packaged to encourage self-feeding, Mr. Piergallini
said. Gerber may market a cold cereal that is low in sugar
and sodium. To win grocery-shelf space, the line will offer
retailers higher margins than some baby foods.
   Mr. Piergallini said many of the "transitional" foods
would be shelf-stable, but he didn't preclude a frozen item
or two. Some would be microwaveable.
   To improve its 71% of the domestic baby-food market, Mr.
Piergallini said Gerber is focusing on target accounts and
certain geographic areas to boost its share. Meanwhile, the
company is developing such products as the recently
introduced yogurt-and-juice line to expand its core business.
   Mr. Piergallini also said Gerber may add a soy-based
infant formula to complement its milk-based product, which he
said has about a 2.7% market share following its introduction
last year.
   Gerber Products will also develop new products to enhance
its Gerber-branded general merchandise business.
   Mr. Piergallini said the company is doing about $70
million in sales, primarily in grocery stores. A dedicated
sales force will seek to broaden distribution into
mass-merchandise and related outlets, he said.
   The company may seek to fill in niches in this market
through acquisitions, Mr. Piergallini said, adding that while
Gerber has identified several prospects it has no immediate
acquisition plans.
   Some analysts have suggested that Gerber dispose of its
children's apparel business, but Mr. Piergallini, who came to
the company early this year from Nestle's Carnation unit,
said, "We think it still fits into our strategic objectives."
   While earnings from children's wear were between 6% and 8%
of sales this past year, Mr. Piergallini said he hopes to
increase that return to 10% this year. Environmental concerns
about disposable diapers are enhancing sales of Gerber's line
of cloth diapers, he said.
   Meanwhile, the new chief executive is implementing a
productivity program and cost-cutting effort designed to cut
fixed overhead by 2% this year. The company already has saved
"an awful lot of money" by going to a lighter-weight glass
jar, he said. Also, as much as 40% of the glass is recycled
material.
   Gerber is concentrating on expanding sales in Europe, Mr.
Piergallini said, citing a joint venture with CPC
International in France and a recent entry into Poland.
Gerber also is about to open a cereal plant near Alexandria,
Egypt, to serve the Middle East. In the Pacific Rim, Gerber
is looking for what its chairman called "partnerships and
alliances with other companies. I doubt you would see Gerber
go it alone there."
