   HANOVER, West Germany -- West German companies have put
most business ventures with East Germany on ice until the
start of monetary union July 2, executives at major West
German industrial groups say.
   After a flurry of preliminary agreements on joint ventures
and investment projects earlier in the year, the companies
are waiting for clear financial information from potential
East German partners and details on the government's economic
program before pushing their plans any further.

   "The period between the announcement of a monetary union
and its implementation is a difficult time," said Heinz
Schimmelbusch, chairman of Metallgesellschaft AG, a
diversified metals concern that is particularly active in
Eastern Europe. "At the moment, there is almost nothing we
can do."
   The reluctance of West German companies to make any firm
investment commitment in East Germany could brake the arrival
of the economic boom that many economists and politicians
have predicted. But companies say that once the mark has
become the official currency and legal and economic
conditions are right, they are planning to move quickly to
transfer the needed capital to East Germany.
   Managers list a series of uncertainties that stop them
from acting before July 2, ranging from the treatment of East
German corporate debt to energy prices, wages and business
regulations. Most difficult is the absence of clear laws
governing corporate ownership, they say.
   In the coming weeks, the East German government is
planning to pass a series of laws that should create a
similar business environment as that found in West Germany,
but companies say they aren't willing to commit funds on
promises alone.
   "The necessary legal basis just doesn't exist yet," said
Friedrich Schunder, a senior official at engineering concern
Mannesmann AG. "We don't know whether we can hold the
majority in a company, we can't buy any real estate, we can't
hire East Germans freely, and there is no protection for
investments."
   Because of these constraints, "we can't adopt any measure
that affects the wealth of the concern," Mr. Schunder added.
