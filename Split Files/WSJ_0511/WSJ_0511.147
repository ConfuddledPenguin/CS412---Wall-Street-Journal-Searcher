   A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the last count
of a lawsuit brought by Xerox Corp. challenging the copyright
covering the command system of Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh.
   The judge, Vaughn Walker, had dismissed in March the first
five counts of the lawsuit, which sought to invalidate the
copyright covering the Macintosh's easy-to-use graphics
command system, charging it copied the Xerox Star program.

   Xerox, Stamford, Conn., agreed to dismissal of the sixth
count "because it wouldn't provide the relief we originally
sought," cancellation of the Apple copyright, said Xerox
attorney Henry Bunsow. He said Xerox is weighing an appeal of
the overall decision.
   Apple, Cupertino, Calif., has pending before the same
judge lawsuits against Microsoft Corp. of Bellevue, Wash.,
and Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., charging their
products infringe upon the Macintosh copyrights.
