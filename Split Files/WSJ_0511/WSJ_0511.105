   Heart and blood-pressure diseases caused nearly one
million deaths in 1987, almost as much as all other causes of
death combined. Nearly one-fifth of these people were under
age 65, and 5% were under age 45.
                                                                                                       

   Heart attack ................................... 52.6%
   Stroke ......................................... 15.3%
   Hypertensive disease ...........................  3.2%
   Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease ....  0.6%
   Other .......................................... 28.3%

   1954: The heart-lung machine, a mechanical pump that
oxygenates and pumps blood during heart surgery, is
developed, making open-heart surgery possible.

   1962: Intra-aortic balloon pump, which temporarily
increases coronary-artery blood flow, is introduced.
                                                                                                       

   1968: Coronary angiography allows physicians to examine
blood vessels or chambers ofthe heart by tracing the course
of dye that's been injected into the bloodstream.
   -- Bypass surgery improves the blood supply to the heart
by constructing a detour around the blocked part of the
coronary artery using a blood vessel from another part of the
body.

was used for three days before the transplant of a human
heart.
