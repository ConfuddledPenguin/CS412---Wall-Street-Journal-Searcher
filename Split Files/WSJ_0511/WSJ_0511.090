   ITT Corp. indicated it might be willing to sell some or
all of its 37% stake in Alcatel N.V., a European
telecommunications joint venture. Outsiders value the stake
at about $3 billion.
   After ITT's comments at an analyst meeting in New York,
the company's stock, which had hit a new 52-week low in late
April, jumped $2 to close at $54.75 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Wall Street speculated that the
company would use the proceeds to buy back its shares.

   However, some analysts believe some proceeds could be
earmarked for capital spending because ITT also said at the
meeting that it plans to buy out its majority partner in two
New York City hotels.
   Alcatel was formed in 1986. To create it, ITT sold its
European telecommunications operations to Compaigne Generale
d'Electricite of France in exchange for $1.3 billion and 37%
of the stock of the newly combined CGE-ITT operations. The
remaining 63% in Alcatel is owned by CGE.
   An ITT spokesman confirmed that ITT and CGE would hold
discussions on ITT's Alcatel position after ITT completes its
annual meeting next week and CGE concludes a 5.5 billion
French franc ($999.8 million) bond offering.
   The key question is how much is ITT's Alcatel stake worth.
According to analysts at the meeting, ITT officials said they
didn't know what CGE paid for a 1.5% stake in Alcatel that it
had recently purchased from Credit Lyonnais, a French bank.
However, M. Cabell Woodward, ITT's vice chairman and chief
financial officer, said Wall Street believes it's worth about
$3 billion.
   It does seem that CGE may already be eyeing ITT's share of
Alcatel. At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Woodward acknowledged
that Pierre Suard, CGE's chairman, has said within the past
month that CGE wants to increase its Alcatel stake. He added
that CGE had discussed these intentions with ITT Chairman
Rand Araskog, who serves as chairman of Alcatel's supervisory
board.
   ITT's stock had slumped after a December analyst meeting
when Mr. Araskog praised Alcatel's profitability and growth
prospects in Eastern Europe. Many analysts, who had been
hoping ITT would unload some of its Alcatel stake this year,
took Mr. Araskog's comments then as an indication that ITT
planned to hold onto Alcatel for a long time. Under its
agreement with CGE, ITT wasn't permitted to sell any portion
of its Alcatel stake without CGE's permission until this
year.
   ITT took advantage of the slide in its stock to buy back
shares aggressively. It bought about 426,000 shares in the
first quarter and about 800,000 shares more since the second
quarter began.
   ITT officials also said at the meeting that the company
had a preliminary agreement to purchase Equitable Life
Assurance Society's majority position in the Sheraton Centre
Hotel and the Sheraton City Squire. Terms weren't disclosed.
ITT, based in New York, traditionally manages Sheraton
hotels. But with the acquisition from New York-based
Equitable, it would own the real estate for three midtown
Manhattan hotels, including the Sheraton St. Regis on Fifth
Avenue.
   Because of the hotel acquisitions and plans to begin major
renovations at both hotels later this year, ITT's capital
spending will be greater than the $750 million originally
planned. Phua Young at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes
the company could spend some $850 million this year and a
similar amount in 1991, depending on the extent of the
renovations.
