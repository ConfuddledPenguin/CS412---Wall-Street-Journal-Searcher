   Banks Take to the Road
   In Search of Customers

   MOBILE BANKS are rolling onto the scene, one of the latest
bids to find untapped customers who might want to open
accounts.
   First National Bank of Jackson, Tenn., for instance, plans
to take its new mobile branch -- a converted armored car --
into "areas often ignored by banks, including nursing homes,
factory sites and public housing projects," says Chairman
Ernest Vickers III. That was enough to win government
approval, not to mention the endorsement of the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   The brightly painted truck, which has regular daily hours,
will initially cash checks, set up savings plans and sell
certificates of deposit. Eventually, customers will be able
to apply for loans and mortgages.
   First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Raleigh, N.C., is
taking a similar route. It now features a mobile automatic
teller machine, embedded in the side of a van. Although it
won't accept deposits or loan payments, the unit will travel
to fairs and other big gatherings to dispense cash to
customers who are ATM clients.
   Bankers say the cost of setting up and operating a mobile
branch is roughly one-tenth of what it costs to build and
operate the smallest brick-and-mortar office.
   They also want to stress service. Mr. Vickers of First
National, in Tennesee, says: "We figured if Federal Express
and United Parcel Service are going to folks' front doors to
pick up packages, why should bankers demand" that customers
come to them?
                                                                                                       

   A State Hopes Pride
   And Cash Have Affinity
                                                                                                       

   WHAT'S GOOD for Elvis fans might be good for Rhode Island.
   Faced with a $100 million shortfall in this year's $1.5
billion budget, Rhode Island's Legislature passed two
separate bills authorizing the state's general treasurer to
negotiate with banks and thrifts to establish a Rhode Island
credit card. The state would garner a percentage of a fee
every time a holder uses the card.
   In recent years, the credit-card market has been saturated
by such "affinity cards" -- available for everyone from Elvis
Presley lovers to sports fans.
   State Senator David H. Sholes says a card emblazoned with
Rhode Island's seal or a picture of the state's pristine
seashore could generate as much as $3 million for state
coffers in the first year. Of course, that means some 60,000
of the roughly 850,000 credit cards held by Rhode Island
residents must make the switch.
   "That's counting on a lot of state pride," says David
Watson, vice president of marketing for Cardholder Management
Services Inc., a credit-card consulting company. "It's
difficult to translate that kind of intangible good feeling
into switching credit cards. You've got to offer something
more concrete, like discounts."
   Indeed, a similar state-sponsored affinity card program
was approved in Montana last year, but has gone nowhere for
lack of interest.
                                                                                                       

   Will Depositors Flood In
   For More Liquid CDs?
                                                                                                       

   SEVERAL BANKS and thrifts are easing restrictions on
certificates of deposit, trying to make them more liquid in
an attempt to attract investors.
   Some investors shy away from CDs because there can be
stiff penalties for early withdrawals -- often the loss of
both interest and a portion of the principal. Young families,
in particular, "have so many big-ticket expenses that can pop
up on them," says Paul Jennings, senior vice president of DF
Southeastern Inc., a Decatur, Ga., savings and loan. "They
want the higher CD rate, but are afraid to tie up the money."
   DF Southeastern's new Wait-and-CD, which earns 7.75%, acts
as a temporary parking space, says Mr. Jennings. The customer
has the option, during the six-month maturity, of switching
to a higher-rate CD or withdrawing the funds altogether --
with no penalty. "This is a less-imposing way for younger
customers to get their feet wet," he says.
   In some cases, the penalties haven't been eliminated, just
softened. The Access CD, introduced last month by First of
America Bank Corp. in Kalamazoo, Mich., gives customers
access to their accounts without penalty. But to get what
amounts to an 8% annual rate on their CDs, customers must
keep a minimum of $1,000 deposited throughout the two-year
term -- otherwise, they will get just 6%.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   IMAGINE NEVER having to make a last-minute dash for cash
before a movie. The American Multi-Cinema Theaters Inc. chain
and Los Angeles-based First Interstate Corp. are testing an
automated box office to dispense tickets, as well as $20
vouchers for popcorn and other refreshments. Customers would
simply use their automatic teller cards. . . . Synergistics
Research Corp. in Atlanta is conducting a study to figure out
why there is a resurgence in telephone banking. Such services
were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but fizzled
when banks began offering services through personal
computers. Now, the pendulum is swinging back. . . .
Sweepstakes are often a no-win proposition for banks. People
invariably wander in seeking a chance at an island vacation
without ever inquiring about bank services. So First Bank
System Inc. of Minneapolis is adding a twist: All players win
discounts on various bank products, as well chances at other
prizes such as a camera or 1990 Jeep Cherokee.
