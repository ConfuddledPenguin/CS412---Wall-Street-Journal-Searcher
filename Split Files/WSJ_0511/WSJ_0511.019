   NEW YORK -- One of the nation's largest penny-stock
brokerage firms was fined $1.9 million for overcharging
customers and agreed to stop making markets in a broad range
of low-priced stocks.
   The fine against Stuart-James Co., Denver, is the largest
ever imposed on a member firm by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory body for the
over-the-counter stock market. Also fined were Stuart-James's
president, its head trader and a former chairman.

   The case, which the firm settled without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, comes amid growing pressure in Washington
for a crackdown on penny-stock frauds. The NASD said that
Stuart-James marked up four low-priced stocks between 6.9%
and 153% in selling them to investors.
   Sarah Ackerson, chief of a Securities and Exchange
Commission unit set up to curb market manipulation, called
the settlement a "significant step" in cracking down on
penny-stock fraud and in protecting investors from excessive
markups. The settlement doesn't affect a continuing SEC
investigation of Stuart-James and its top officials, said
Robert Davenport, the SEC's regional administrator in Denver.
   In settling with the NASD, Stuart-James agreed to several
remedial actions. According to the settlement, the firm will:
   -- Not trade or underwrite so-called "blind pool" or
"blank check" companies.
   -- Send written notice to customers of the highest bid and
lowest asked prices for stocks when they are traded.
   -- Seek other independent dealers in underwriting
securities.
   -- Undergo surveillance of its markup practices by an
independent consultant.
   One surprising part of the settlement was the disclosure
that as of last Jan. 1, Stuart-James quietly stopped making
markets in penny stocks that aren't traded on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
It is still making markets in stocks on Nasdaq (these stocks
are required to meet certain financial criteria).
   An attorney for Stuart-James said the lost business isn't
significant for the firm, which he said represented only 3%
of its revenue before Jan. 1.
   Stuart-James attorney Peter Gadkowski conceded the
regulatory scrutiny of penny-stock trading has hurt the
brokerage firm's business. The firm now has 1,000 brokers and
40 branch offices, down from 1,350 brokers and 47 branch
offices two years ago, Mr. Gadkowski said. Penny stocks are
those issues generally priced under $1 a share.
   However, he said in the past few years Stuart-James has
moved to "upgrade the nature of the (initial public)
offerings we're doing from start-up situations to companies
more seasoned and in need of mezzanine financing."
   Mr. Gadkowski also contended that Stuart-James stopped
making markets in penny stocks not listed on Nasdaq because
of a new SEC regulation cracking down on "cold calls" to
first-time investors, not because of the settlement talks
with NASD, which began last fall.
   But John Pinto, NASD vice president of compliance,
disagreed with that interpretation. "Their agreement with us
is far broader" than the regulation of first-time customers,
said Mr. Pinto. "You could be a customer for five years
dealing with non-Nasdaq stocks," and no longer be able to
trade through Stuart-James, he explained. "They're out of
that business."
   The action taken against the brokerage firm's top
officials included: a $105,000 fine against James Padgett,
president and sole shareholder; a $25,000 fine against Stuart
Graff, former chairman; and a $30,000 fine against Steven
Pata, head trader.
   Mr. Padgett also cannot act as a supervisor over the
markup area for six months. Mr. Graff was suspended from
acting as a principal for 60 days. Mr. Pata was suspended in
all capacities for 20 days.
   Mr. Padgett referred calls to the attorney, Mr. Gadkowski.
Messrs. Graff and Pata couldn't be reached for comment
yesterday.
