   Everyone knows how fast technology is changing. Everyone
knows about markets becoming global and about shifts in the
work force and in demographics. But few people pay attention
to changing distributive channels. Yet, how goods and
services get to customers and where customers buy are
changing fully as fast as technology, markets and demography.
And they are changing fast all over the world.
   The bulk of consumer electronics -- radios, TVs, VCRs,
calculators -- were sold in Britain 15 years ago by thousands
of independent, locally owned "mom-and-pop" shops. Today the
bulk of these goods is sold by four national chains. The
mom-and-pop shop had to carry major manufacturers' brands and
relied on the manufacturers' advertising. The four big chains
carry their own private brands and do their own advertising.

   In the U.S. office furniture -- chairs, desks, filing
cabinets -- was bought 15 years ago in specialized
office-furniture stores. Increasingly these goods are now
being bought in discount stores and "buying clubs."
   The recent Japanese promise to repeal the law that
protects their mom-and-pop shops and keeps out big stores and
chains, has been hailed as a great American victory. But in
Japan's metropolitan areas (where 60% of the population live
and shop), a majority of the mom &amp; pop shops have already
been converted into franchises of huge chains such as
7/Eleven or Mister Donut.
   Six or seven years ago, mutual funds were distributed in
the U.S. through two channels: indirectly, through brokerage
houses and directly, through TV advertising. These two
channels still carry something like three-fifths of all
mutual funds sold. But one of the big mutual-fund groups
(which six years ago sold exclusively through brokers) now
sells 15% of its products through regional banks, 15% through
insurance agencies and another 15% through professional and
trade associations.
   The hospital became a major market only 25 years ago. But
then the hospital itself bought the goods it used. Now a
steadily growing share is bought by independent outsiders to
whom the hospital contracts maintenance, patient feeding,
billing, physical therapy, the pharmacy, X-ray, the medical
lab and so on.
   Increasingly even large users do not themselves buy their
computers. They are bought instead by computer management
firms that design, buy, install and run their clients'
information systems. A major computer maker, Digital
Equipment Corp. now has its own computer-management
subsidiary.
   Where customers buy is changing fast too.
   Many major department store chains are in serious trouble.
Some once great stores -- Bonwit Teller, for instance, or B.
Altman, only recently New York's fashion leaders -- are going
out of business. Others, such as Bloomingdale's, are in
bankruptcy. But one chain, Seattle-based Nordstrom, has been
doing well. The department stores that are in trouble are all
organized and run as downtown stores with suburban branches.
Nordstrom has only suburban stores. We may be seeing the
first result of the slow but steady move of office work out
of downtown and into the suburbs where the office workers
live.
   The big "wire houses," the New York-based stockbrokers
such as Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman, did exceptionally
well only a few years ago. Now they are losing sales and
profits. But some large "regional" houses (i.e., brokers not
headquartered in New York) such as A.G. Edwards in St. Louis,
are doing fine. And so are some "institutional brokers" such
as New York-based Sanford Bernstein.
   The wire houses serve both the "retail customer" -- the
individual investor -- and the "wholesale customer" -- the
pension funds. A.G. Edwards serves primarily the retail
market, Sanford Bernstein exclusively the institutional
market. Traditionally large stockbrokers were successful in
serving both markets. But in no other line of business, do
retail customers and wholesale customers shop in the same
place. Are the securities markets now segmenting themselves
the way every other market has?
   Changes in distributive channels may not matter much to
GNP and macro-economics. But they should be a major concern
of every business and every industry. Yet they are very
difficult to predict. What's worse: They do not show up in
reports and statistics until they have gone very far. They
are what statisticians call "changes at the margin." And by
the time such changes become statistically significant, it is
usually too late to adapt to them, let alone to exploit them
as opportunities.
   The one way to be abreast of them is to go out and look
for these changes. Here again are a few examples:
   Alfred P. Sloan built General Motors into the world's
premier manufacturing company, in the '20s and '30, by
actually working with customers. Once every three months he
would disappear from Detroit without telling any one where he
was going. The next morning he would show up at a dealer's
lot in Memphis or Albany, would introduce himself and would
ask the dealer's permission to work as a salesman for a
couple of days or as an assistant service manager. During
that week he would work like this in two more dealerships in
two other cities. The following Monday he'd be back in
Detroit, firing off memoranda on changing customer behavior
and changing customer preferences, on dealer service and on
company service to the dealer, on market trends and style
trends.
   GM in those years had the most up-to-date and
comprehensive customer research in American industry. And yet
-- at least so I was told by the then head of customer
research at GM-Sloan, by actually working in the field
spotted more and more important trends than did customer
research, and spotted them earlier.
   The late Karl Bays made American Hospital Corp. the leader
in its industry during the 1970s. He himself credited his
success largely to his going out into the field. Twice a year
he would take for two weeks each the place of a salesman on
vacation. When the salesman came back, Bays said (with a
twinkle in his eye) "the customer always complained about the
incompetence of his replacement and about the dumb questions
I asked." But selling, Bays said, was not the point of the
exercise; learning was.
   Another variant: two men who together took over a small
and lackluster chain of fashion shops in the mid-'50s built
it into one of America's retail giants. For 30 years, until
their retirement, each spent every Saturday in a different
shopping mall. They did not visit their own stores. They
spent the day in other companies' stores -- some fashion
stores, some book shops, some stores for household goods and
so on, watching shoppers, watching sales people, chatting
with store managers. And they insisted that every one of
their senior executives do likewise, including the lawyer,
the controller and the vice president for personnel.
   As a result, the company foresaw in the early '60s the
coming of the "youth culture" and built or remodelled stores
to attract teen-agers. A few years later, when every one
talked of the "greening of America" the company realized that
the youth culture was passe and changed merchandise and
stores to attract the young adult. And another 10 years
later, well before 1980, the company saw and understood the
emergence of the two-earner family.
   To be able to anticipate changes in distributive channels
and in where customers buy (and how, which is equally
important) one has to be in the marketplace, has to watch
customers, and non-customers, has to ask "dumb questions." It
is almost 40 years since I first advised executives to "walk
around" -- that is, to get out of their offices, visit and
talk to their associates in the company. This was the right
advice then; now it is the wrong thing to do, and a waste of
the executive's scarcest resource, his time. For now we know
how to build upward information into the organization. To
depend on walking around actually may lull executives into a
false sense of security; it may make them believe that they
have information when all they have is what their
subordinates wanted them to hear.
   The right advice to executives now is to walk outside.
