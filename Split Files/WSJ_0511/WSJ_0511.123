   Torchmark Corp. said its Liberty National Life Insurance
Co. unit will acquire the life insurance division of Service
Corp. International for $165.1 million.
   Torchmark, Birmingham, Ala., said the purchase of Family
Service Life Insurance Co., which sells life insurance and
annuities to fund prearranged funeral plans, is expected to
enhance Liberty National's successful, but small line of
burial insurance.

   Service Corp., Houston, said it is disposing of the
insurance operations as part of a restructuring that will
allow it to focus on its core, funeral-related businesses.
   A Service spokesman said the unit was a "big user of cash"
and -- while profitable -- was considerably less so than its
funeral operations. The unit specialized in marketing $1,000
to $5,000 insurance policies.
   Torchmark said closing of the deal is expected within the
next several months.
