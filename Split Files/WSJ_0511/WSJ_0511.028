   BRUSSELS -- Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Austria and other
Western European countries outside the European Community
could become an investment backwater, according to a new
survey of business plans of European and U.S. companies.
   The survey, carried out by the large international
management consulting firm KPMG, shows that both European and
U.S. companies expect more business opportunities in the
European Community and Eastern Europe, at the expense of the
other Western European nations.

   According to the poll carried out in March and April, only
12% of U.S. companies and 19% of European companies have
plans to increase their trade or investment with Switzerland,
Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland or Iceland -- the six
members of the European Free Trade Association. Meanwhile,
more than half of all companies surveyed plan to increase
trade within the EC, and 35% plan increases somewhere in
Eastern Europe.
   The findings, based on interviews with executives at 108
leading U.S. and European companies, help explain the
persistent worries by the EFTA nations about the EC's 1992
program and other changes in Europe. Fearing that they will
be left behind by a more dynamic EC, the EFTA nations have
been trying to make sure they have full access to the 1992
single market. Austria has applied for membership in the EC
and some experts predict that Norway -- and perhaps even
Sweden and Switzerland -- could follow.
   The EFTA countries have also pushed the EC for creating an
18-nation free-trade zone, known as the European Economic
Space. Formal talks on this subject moved a step closer this
week when the EC Commission approved its negotiating
position. But such talks, which are scheduled to begin in
June, are likely to be highly divisive because of a
reluctance of the EC to allow the EFTA to participate in EC
decision-making. The EFTA is also unlikely to agree to a full
opening of its markets to the EC countries.
   Such complications for the EFTA, the KPMG survey suggests,
could be good news for Eastern Europe, though. About a third
of European companies and 28% of U.S. companies say they have
specific plans to expand their business relations there. The
findings also suggest that the opening of Eastern Europe has
had a dramatic effect on strategic planning by large
companies: Seven out of 10 companies say that events in
Eastern Europe have affected their business plans -- 29% by a
large extent.
   "This is clearly a whole new set of business issues that
now has to be considered along with the (EC's) single
market," said Clive Stanbrook, a legal consultant for KPMG,
commenting on the survey results.
   "Top business brains on both sides of the Atlantic are
clearly taking a great interest in Eastern Europe," added
Scott Cormack, head of the Brussels-based KPMG European
Business Center.
