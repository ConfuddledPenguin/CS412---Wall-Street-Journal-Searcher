   TORONTO -- Conwest Exploration Co., Mineral Resources
International Ltd. and Barons Oil Ltd. said their

   Under terms of the merger, Conwest, a Toronto-based oil,
gas and mining concern, will issue new Class B subordinate
voting shares to minority holders of both subsidiaries.
Conwest owns 51% of Mineral Resources, a mining concern.
Toronto-based Mineral Resources owns 85% of Barons, an oil

   The new company will retain the name Conwest Exploration
Co. The merger is expected to take effect June 1.
   Separately, John Lamacraft, Conwest's president and chief
executive officer, said he expects operating income this year
of 65.5 million Canadian dollars ($56.2 million) on revenue
of C$122.1 million, up from last year's operating income of
C$56.6 million and revenue of C$103.2 million. Operating
income is figured before taxes, depreciation, interest costs
and minority interest payments.
   Mr. Lamacraft, speaking at the company's annual meeting,
said the gains will come largely from increased production of
oil and natural gas, following several recent acquisitions.
   In yesterday's trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
Conwest Class B shares closed at 12.75 Canadian dollars
($10.94), up 37.5 cents. Mineral Resources shares rose 37.5
cents, to C$5.50; and Barons shares gained 15 cents, to close
at C$2.90.
