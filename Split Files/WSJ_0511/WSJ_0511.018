   WHEN DONALD PIZZIFERRO, a hard-driving 53-year-old
insurance executive from Bloomingdale, Ill., took a stress
test for heart disease during a routine physical in 1988, the
results were reassuring.
   "I had a little shortness of breath, a little weakness in
the legs" after running on the treadmill, "but basically,
everything was fine," says Mr. Pizziferro, a self-described
"Type A" personality who worked 60 to 70 hours a week for
most of his career. When the electrocardiogram showed his
heart working normally under stress, he says, "I thought,
`Well, gee, I got a clean bill of health,'" and he went back
to work as usual.

   Four weeks later, he had a heart attack.
   Unsuspecting, he drove himself to the hospital that night
with an annoying case of nausea. He was stunned when
physicians in the emergency room told him he had had a heart
attack and swept him into intensive care. He has since had
bypass surgery.
   The exercise stress test, one of the most widely used
procedures in predicting heart disease, is also one of the
least reliable. On the average, the test is accurate in
diagnosing coronary-artery disease only 65% of the time; in
some age and gender groups, the test has a lower accuracy
rate than a coin flip.
   Such inaccuracy carries a high price. False positives can
have crippling effects on people who thought they were
healthy -- leading to unnecessary, and perhaps dangerous,
follow-up testing. False negatives can keep patients from
undergoing lifesaving surgery, discourage them from adopting
life-style changes, and make it easier for them to deny their
symptoms.
   "People who want a stress test to see whether they have
coronary-artery disease should realize that they may end up
with the proverbial can of worms," says James L. Weiss,
associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine.
   Few people do realize that, however, and the popularity of
the stress test is growing fast, particularly among aging
baby boomers worried about the nation's No. 1 killer. The
procedure, which entails walking or running on a treadmill
with electrocardiogram monitors attached to the chest, is
simple to administer and is cheap, costing about $165 to
$300. It's also non-invasive and safe, causing problems in
only about one in 10,000 cases. The most accurate, widely
available alternative, angiography, which entails inserting
catheters through blood vessels, injecting a dye and getting
an image of the heart, is expensive, costing more than $3,000
per procedure. Angiograms also can be traumatic and
occasionally are fatal.
   Moreover, the stress test is a valuable tool for some
patients. It is more accurate in patients who already have a
high likelihood of cardiovascular disease, including men over
45 and women over 55 with high cholesterol or blood pressure,
or a family history of heart disease. It can be helpful in
supervising or planning an exercise program for people who
have had a heart attack or heart surgery.
   Ken Cooper, president of the Aerobics Research Institute,
a not-for-profit fitness center in Dallas, says many stress
tests prove wrong because the test giver doesn't make the
subject work hard enough on the treadmill or fails to monitor
the test or interpret the results correctly.
   Clearly, though, the stress test is more limited than many
patients realize. Positive results, reflected in abnormal
electrocardiogram readings, actually reflect coronary-artery
disease only 60% to 70% of the time. Negative readings are
accurate only about 75% of the time. In some groups, such as
women without symptoms, positive readings may be correct only
40% of the time.
   Test results are even less helpful in predicting symptoms
in symptomless people. A recent Baltimore study showed that
only 19% of 726 symptomless people who had positive stress
test results suffered angina, a heart attack or cardiac death
within 6.4 years. Other research indicates that the majority
of people who die suddenly of heart disease without first
exhibiting symptoms will test negative on the treadmill, says
Daniel B. Mark, cardiologist at Duke University Medical
Center.
   "There's no good way, with 1990s technology, to find those
people," Dr. Mark says.
   Nevertheless, demand for the exercise test remains strong.
Many patients walk into their doctor's office and demand one.
Some health clubs require them of members. Cardio-Fitness
Corp., a chain of health clubs, asks members over 35 to get a
stress test from their physician. While the tests yield some
false results, "it's the best you can do" to protect members
and guard against liability, says Jerome Zuckerman, president
of the New York-based chain.
   The test is lucrative for doctors, providing an added
incentive. "It's a test that many physicians are doing
without a clear understanding of the limitations and
indications for the procedure," says James Rippe, head of the
exercise and physiology laboratory at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School.
   Public demand for the test is fostering some large-scale
rip-offs of insurers. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and two other
insurers recently won an $18 million judgment against two
California men who were operating 240 mobile testing labs.
The men were administering unnecessary stress tests, among
other things, to thousands of patients, says Aetna, which is
planning to study whether it should set standards of review
for the procedure.
   "The test is being used by a lot of rascals to feather
their economic beds," says John H. Renner, president of the
Consumer Health Information Research Institute, a Kansas City
health-fraud watchdog.
   The problem springs in part from the heart's remarkable
ability to mask its symptoms. For about half the people with
heart disease, the first symptom is a heart attack.
Conversely, chest pain isn't a reliable indicator of serious
cardiac problems.
   Stress testing offers a way to provoke the heart into
revealing the effects of coronary-artery disease. The patient
exercises to exhaustion, to a maximum heart rate for his or
her age, or until chest pains occur. The blood pressure is
checked periodically during and after the test, while the
physician watches the electrocardiogram.
   But the heart can send cryptic signals. A long list of
pre-existing conditions can cause false results, including
hypertension and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as
the use of some medications. Also, a partially obstructed
vessel might work fine during a stress test, then rupture the
next day, causing instant death.
   Physical exertion became increasingly difficult in recent
years for Claudine Johnston, a St. George, S.C., housewife;
she finally got to the point that she could barely cross the
street without feeling nauseated and out of breath. But she
passed two stress tests. By the time her family persuaded her
to undergo angiography at age 70 a couple of months ago,
three of the vessels to her heart were obstructed and she
needed bypass surgery.
   The test's unreliability makes the supervision of a
skilled physician even more crucial. A suburban Chicago
construction executive who was suffering chest pain during
exercise complained repeatedly to his doctors, who cited his
negative stress-test results as proof that his heart was
fine. He switched in exasperation to a veteran cardiologist,
who ordered an angiogram. The diagnosis: coronary artery
disease, with a need for angioplasty.
   "He was frustrated that nobody would believe him," says
the cardiologist, Arvind Menon of Highland Park Hospital in
Highland Park, Ill., who has been conducting stress tests for
24 years, although he interprets them with a great deal of
circumspection. "Time and again he told me this was
happening, and I had to listen to him. One can never ignore
the patient."
   Alternatives to the exercise stress test all have major
drawbacks. They are significantly more expensive, and most of
them carry greater risk.
   All of which leaves physicians continuing to grapple with
the shortcomings of the stress test. "If someone could
develop a noninvasive, 100% accurate test for the presence of
cardiovascular disease that is also cheap, it would be a
great service to humanity," says Irwin Silverman, an
associate in clinical medicine at Northwestern University.
   Most, however, hold out little hope. "People who have no
symptoms but who want to be able to say with certainty, `Do I
have heart disease or not?' are chasing a chimera -- a
ghost," says the University of Massachusetts's Dr. Rippe.
"The medical profession shouldn't fall into the trap of
trying to give people certainty where there is precious
little.
   "The future lies not in developing ever more sophisticated
tests," he adds, "but in using our knowledge of exercise to
encourage people to adopt life styles that will lower their
likelihood of getting heart disease in the first place."
