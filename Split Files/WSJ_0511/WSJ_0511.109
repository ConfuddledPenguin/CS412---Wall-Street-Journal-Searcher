   TOKYO -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange decided tentatively at a
meeting of its general members' committee on Thursday to
lower the commissions it permits brokers to charge on each
stock transaction by an average 7.05%.
   The exchange plans to give its official approval to the
committee's decision at its board meeting slated for next
Tuesday and put the new system into effect on June 4.

   An exchange official said the committee decided to act
because the commissions in Japan have become too high in
comparison with those charged in most other countries.
   The planned cut would be smaller than the previous 9.8%
reduction made on Oct. 5, 1987. The official said the
committee wanted to minimize the impact of its action on
brokerage houses, whose earnings have been suffering from
stock plunges since the beginning of this year.
   The cut is likely to hurt future brokerage house earnings,
and the decision was made strictly for the benefit of
investors, according to the official.
   Under the new system, commissions would range from 1.15%
for a transaction of less than 1 million yen ($6,396) to
0.075% for a transaction of more than 1 billion yen.
