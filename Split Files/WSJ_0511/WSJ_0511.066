   WASHINGTON -- Bolivia will buy as much as $300 million of
Brazil's foreign bank debt and exchange it at face value for
its own obligations to Brazil, Bolivian planning minister
Enrique Garcia Rodriguez said.
   Under an arrangement approved by both countries, Bolivia
is buying the Brazilian debt on the secondary market, where
it sells at between 25.5 cents and 27.5 cents for each dollar
of face value. Brazil then is allowing Bolivia to exchange
the debt at face value for Bolivian debt held by Brazil, the
minister said.

   The plan could enable Bolivia to cancel its $300 million
debt to Brazil for as little as $75 million. Bolivia already
has bought Brazilian government debt with a face value of
about $100 million, Mr. Rodriguez said.
   The arrangement should be beneficial to both countries.
Besides allowing Bolivia to pay off obligations at a discount
of as much as 75%, it helps Brazil reduce its $110 billion of
foreign debt. Brazil hasn't made payments on its bank debt in
recent months, but if it resumes debt service it would be
expected to pay interest on the full face value of the debt.
By getting rid of $300 million in foreign debt now, Brazil is
removing an obligation that could cost it about $30 million a
year in interest payments in the future.
   Banks, companies and even a few individuals trade Latin
American and other Third World bank debt on the secondary
loan market. Buying by Bolivia and by big Brazilian companies
such as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Petrobraz have been
among the strongest forces supporting the price of Brazilian
government debt, secondary loan market traders say. The big
Brazilian state companies also have used debt paper to settle
obligations with the government at favorable terms.
   Brazil is likely to get less-favorable terms from its own
bank creditors than it is giving Bolivia. Its negotiations
with them probably will start later this year. Brazil now is
many billions of dollars in arrears on its more than $60
billion of foreign commercial bank debt and also has some
"small arrears" on its debts to foreign governments,
according to Ambassador Jorio Dauster, Brazil's chief debt
negotiator.
   In an interview here this week, Brazil's economics
minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, said her country intends to
reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and
then negotiate with its foreign government creditors and,
next, with its commercial bank creditors. An IMF team is
expected to visit Brazil in the coming weeks.
   The U.S. Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee is
expected to meet in the second half of June to discuss
Brazil's bank debt. That panel, which consists of U.S.
regulators, reviews and grades bank debt to various nations.
If it decides that a country's debt position is below
required standards, banks may be required to set aside
loan-loss reserves or in some cases even begin writing off
some of their debt.
   Meanwhile, Argentina, which like Brazil has frozen savers'
funds in recent months, also is as much as $6 billion in
arrears on its commercial-bank debt obligations. The
Argentines are close to agreeing on a program with the
International Monetary Fund, and they will start negotiating
with their foreign government and bank creditors after that.
   In a speech earlier this week in Buenos Aires, Argentine
President Carlos Saul Menem indicated that his country was
seeking a debt settlement involving $1.5 billion of new loans
and a large debt buy-back. Argentina has ambitious proposals
for privatizing state companies; it would involve allowing
investors to exchange foreign-bank debt for shares in the
privatized ventures. But this would require waivers from bank
creditors. For this and other reasons, bank creditors think
that Argentina may be eager to start negotiating soon.
   "They've told us they think they'll have an agreement with
the IMF by the end of this month," said William Rhodes, the
Citicorp executive who heads the bank committee that
negotiates with Argentina. Mr. Rhodes said he expects talks
with the banks to start soon after that.
   Meanwhile, Bolivia plans to try to buy back the last $210
million of its commercial bank debt, Mr. Rodriguez said. It
will use money provided by Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, the
World Bank and the U.S. to do this, he said. In recent years,
Bolivia bought back most of its foreign bank debt at 11 cents
for each dollar of face value.
