   LIKE MANY BLACK Americans, Ellie B. Jones seems stranded
behind enemy lines in the war on heart disease.
   The 71-year-old McDonough, Ga., retiree has had high blood
pressure for years. But Mr. Jones, who lives with his wife
and son, hasn't been able to afford the blood-pressure pills
a doctor prescribed almost a decade ago. Their cost, perhaps
$100 a month, is "out of sight," he says, given that his
family's income is about $800 a month. "I take two Advils a
day and put my trust in God."

   Cases like Mr. Jones's represent a disturbing countertrend
to U.S. advances against heart disease. Efforts to cut
hypertension and other risk factors, coupled with better
treatments, have sharply lowered the heart-disease death rate
since the mid-1960s. But blacks aren't sharing equally in the
gains.
   Around 1979 the decline in heart-disease mortality began
to level off among blacks while continuing for whites,
according to a 1988 study by the National Center for Health
Statistics. In a grim reminder of that disparity, researchers
recently reported that black men in New York's Harlem
district were less likely to live to age 65 than men in
Bangladesh. Murder, alcohol and drugs caused many of their
early deaths, according to the study, published in the New
England Journal of Medicine. But the leading cause was
cardiovascular disease.
   No one knows exactly what is loading the heart-disease
dice against blacks. But there are plenty of probable
culprits.
   Surveys have shown that the smoking rate among black men
is 8% to 9% higher than among white men, although the rates
have been dropping for both groups. Another factor may be
diet: In one survey, a third of inner-city black mothers said
frying was their first choice among methods of preparing
food. About half of black women and a third of black men in
the U.S. are overweight -- a risk factor for heart disease --
compared with about a fourth of white men and women,
according to federal statistics.
   U.S. blacks are about 40% more likely than whites to have
high blood pressure. Smoking and other life-style choices --
coupled with the stress of growing up in ghettos -- often are
cited as possible causes. Government programs since the 1960s
have helped alleviate blacks' hypertension. But the problem
is far from licked.
   "I remember one black lady with hypertension who literally
smiled when she had to go on dialysis," making her eligible
for government medical benefits, says Neil Shulman, a
hypertension researcher at Emory University. "She said, `At
least now I can afford to get my blood-pressure medicine.'"
   The case illustrates the most disturbing, and perhaps most
important, underlying reason for blacks' high heart-disease
mortality -- their frequent lack of access to sorely needed
medicines and treatment. In a national survey reported last
year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 30%
of blacks with hypertension said they hadn't had an annual
blood-pressure check, compared with 19% of whites. The same
survey found that about half of blacks went to hospital
emergency rooms or other group-care settings for treatment,
compared with about a fourth of whites.
   For Mr. Jones, the man in rural Georgia, the health-care
safety net is a county hospital 30 miles away where the
emergency room sometimes gets so crowded it has to turn away
incoming ambulances. Such hospitals can give little
preventive care, notes Esther Bauer, the community-relations
director at Dallas's Parkland Hospital, which gets many poor
black patients. Some people who go to Parkland have to wait
six months for an appointment.
   Not having regular care hurts even more for patients with
chronic heart problems that need "maintaining" with drugs or
corrective procedures, adds Ron Anderson, Parkland's
president. In a 1985 study, Levi Watkins Jr., a cardiac
surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, found that only 56
blacks had had bypass surgery at his medical school between
1972 and 1980, compared with more than 2,500 whites. The
finding means that blacks, who make up 12% of the population
and have at least as much heart disease as whites, were
getting 2% of the bypasses, says Dr. Watkins. Since then,
Johns Hopkins's rate of bypasses in blacks "has become more
representative" of blacks' share of heart disease, he adds.
   Lack of access to care hurts most of all when heart
attacks hit. But just getting to the hospital is often more
of a problem for blacks than for whites. One study, at
Chicago's Cook County Hospital, showed blacks took an average
of three times longer than whites did to reach the hospital
after the onset of heart-attack symptoms. The black patients
in the study traveled to the emergency room by bus or subway
more often than by ambulance. Many apparently didn't realize
at first that their symptoms meant serious trouble.
   One black patient "told us he was driving near the
hospital when he started having chest pains" of a heart
attack, says Richard Cooper, a Loyola University researcher
and co-author of the Cook County study. "But he figured he'd
have to wait six hours to see a doctor if he stopped at the
hospital, so he just went on home."
   The patient survived. But many don't. In another study,
published in 1985 in the American Heart Journal, researchers
found that the out-of-hospital death rate for black men who
had heart attacks in Columbia, S.C., was 1.8 times that of
white men. Various studies indicate blacks' hearts are
generally in worse shape than whites' hearts are by the time
attacks occur. That may partly explain blacks' higher
heart-attack mortality and higher rate of out-of-hospital
deaths.
   Some medical experts say all of these problems can be
attributed to blacks' high poverty rate, rather than to
racial bias in the medical system. But last year, a
groundbreaking study by Harvard University researchers
strongly suggested that the health-care system treats whites
better than blacks, regardless of economics.
   The study showed that in 1985 in Massachusetts hospitals,
whites with heart problems underwent almost twice as many
bypass operations as black heart patients did -- even when
factors such as financial and insurance status were
discounted. The Harvard researchers, Mark Wenneker and Arnold
Epstein, concluded that "race does seem to be important" in
how heart patients are treated.
   Some doctors assert that the Harvard researchers'
conclusion is far too cautious. "Why do we constantly tiptoe
around the heart of the issue?" asks David Hodges, a
cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital.
"Racism is evident" in medical care, he says, adding,
however, that doctors' racial bias in treating patients is
often "subconscious" and "not malicious."
   In any case, black heart patients often wind up seeing
harried white doctors in public hospitals -- a situation
fraught with problems of communication even if racial bias
isn't involved. For instance, poor black patients often
"think they're being used for guinea pigs" for nefarious
experiments when doctors order blood to be withdrawn for
laboratory tests, says LeeRoy McCurley, a doctor at a clinic
affiliated with Dallas's Parkland Hospital. "Or they'll think
we're going to take their blood and sell it." Moreover, such
patients usually have no regular outside doctor acting as
their hospital "advocates" in getting needed treatment, notes
Jacques Carter, a Boston physician.
   Another factor: Black doctors, who might help bridge the
communications gap with black patients, are in short supply.
Alyce Adams, a black cardiologist who practices in a mostly
black neighborhood in Boston, says she is so overwhelmed by
the health problems there that she seldom gets to focus on
her specialty. "Last year, I was the AIDS doctor," she says.
Now she's working to augment screening for prostate cancer in
her area.
   "It's not that there's something magical about minority
physicians," says Clyde Yancy, a black physician with the
University of Texas in Dallas. "But it's important for
doctors to appreciate that some people haven't gotten a break
in life. You have to educate physicians not to be accusatory
or condescending to them."
   Still, whatever racial bias there is among health-care
workers probably is less a factor in blacks' special
heart-disease problems than policy makers are. "Resources
aren't being allocated" to provide medical care for the poor,
says Laurence Watkins, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cardiologist
and an authority on heart disease in blacks. "It's not so
much a matter of being black or Hispanic or white. It's that
the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer
-- and dying earlier."
