   LOWELL, Mass. -- Comfed Bancorp Inc. said it agreed to
sell $1 billion of residential loan servicing rights to a

   The bank holding company said it will record a pretax gain
of $5 million from the sale in its fiscal first quarter
ending June 30. In the year-earlier first quarter, Comfed had
a loss of $3.7 million.
