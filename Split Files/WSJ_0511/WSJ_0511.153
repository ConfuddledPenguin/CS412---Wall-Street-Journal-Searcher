   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. consolidated three health and beauty
care divisions into two units, in a further move to digest
and reorganize acquired companies.
   Effective July 1, Cincinnati-based P&amp;G said its existing
beauty care; health and personal care; and Richardson-Vicks
divisions will be restructured into two, one with
responsibility for beauty care and the other for health care.

   The new beauty care division will group together existing
activities in beauty care, along with the Noxell division. In
addition, certain businesses from Richardson-Vicks as well as
personal cleansing-products operations from the bar soap and
household cleaning products division will now come under
beauty care.
   The new health care division will encompass existing
activities in health and personal care as well as remaining
businesses from Richardson-Vicks and the Norwich division.
