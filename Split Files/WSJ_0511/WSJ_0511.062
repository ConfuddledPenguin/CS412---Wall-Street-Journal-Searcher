   BOSTON -- Investments by Boston University in a
biotechnology company came under increasing fire after
disclosure that 10 of the school's trustees own stakes in the
company through a limited partnership, raising
conflict-of-interest issues.
   Questions about the school's investment in the company
have dogged the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign of John
Silber, on leave from his post as Boston University's
president. Mr. Silber, known for his strong opinions and
abrasive style, in 1987 spearheaded Boston University's
investment in Seragen Inc., a Hopkinton, Mass., start-up
company that is developing anti-cancer drugs. Critics assert
the investment represents an inappropriately risky use of
school funds.

   Mr. Silber has defended the investment, asserting that
each year it represents less than 3% of the school's $570
million operating budget and supports important medical
research.
   Since 1987, the school has invested more than $60 million
in Seragen, which isn't expected to be profitable until 1995.
Critics note that the school's total investment in Seragen is
the equivalent of about a third of its endowment and related
funds. Boston University owns a 68.3% stake in Seragen and
has been funding its continuing operations at a cost of about
$13 million annually. The school has written off some $26
million of its Seragen investments, offset by an $11 million
gain from the sale of a former Seragen unit.
   The Boston Herald, quoting unidentified sources, reported
that 10 of the 52 members of the school's board of trustees
own stakes in Seragen through Commonwealth Partners, a
limited partnership set up by the school. None of the
trustees, including Boston University's treasurer, Charles W.
Smith, could be reached for comment. Mr. Silber, who wasn't
one of the named investors in Seragen, declined to comment.
   In a written statement, Boston University said
Commonwealth bought less than 0.5% of Seragen's stock "well
after the university had already purchased the controlling
interest in the company." The school asserted that the
investment doesn't represent a conflict of interest for the
parties involved.
   But some present and former faculty members disagreed. "If
the trustees' reported investment in Seragen is true, I would
think it represents a definite conflict of interest," said
Henry Morgan, former dean of Boston University's school of
business and an outspoken critic of the Seragen investment.
"If {the trustees} stand to personally gain from {the
school's} investment, I'm not sure they can make an
independent judgment on whether its a good investment for the
university."
   Added Bernice Buresh, a former journalism professor at the
school who resigned in 1988 because of an unrelated dispute
with Mr. Silber: "There is a feeling that the trustees should
be scrutinizing {the Seragen} investment instead of jumping
on the bandwagon."
