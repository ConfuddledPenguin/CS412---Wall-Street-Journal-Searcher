   SEOUL -- South Korea's worries about an "economic crisis"
have become a self-fulfilling prophecy to a growing segment
of the middle class -- and they're fighting mad about it.
   In a country where protests against dictatorship and the
U.S. have become commonplace, the most significant aspect of
Korea's latest outburst of demonstrations is that they focus
more on economic rather than political grievances.

   As tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets
across the nation Wednesday to demand the dissolution of the
new ruling Democratic Liberal Party, their appeal was based
on bread-and-butter issues. Banners on the campus of Yonsei
University, the center of anti-government student activity in
Seoul, talked about rising inflation, rampant real-estate
speculation and housing shortages.
   At the same time, swarms of young, middle-class office
workers in suits joined thousands of students and dissidents
in downtown Seoul in taunting riot police and chanting
slogans like: "Save our livelihoods," "Give us houses," and
"Down with dictators and tycoons."
   "People are furious," said a Korean political analyst who
watched the protests escalate. "They see big businessmen
getting richer and richer, and gobbling up all the real
estate in the country, while the middle class can't afford to
buy houses and the poor can't even pay their rent."
   Inflation, fueled mostly by housing costs, is running at
an annual rate of about 14%, up from 6% last year. The
government's Economic Planning Board reports that real-estate
speculation has doubled house prices in the past several
years and is responsible for a 30% rise in land prices in
1989 alone. That has pushed up average rents by 45% in the
past year.
   In recent months, land speculation also has drained about
five trillion won ($7.17 billion) from banks and the stock
market. That caused share prices to plummet in the first four
months of this year, bankrupting hundreds of small investors
and enriching large landholders -- especially insurance and
securities companies owned by big business groups, which have
speculated heavily in real estate. On Thursday, Seoul share
prices plunged 2.7% in response to the political unrest.
   Even the firebombing of the U.S. Information Service, or
USIS, office in the capital Wednesday, while chiefly aimed at
forcing the withdrawal of 43,000 American troops stationed in
Korea, had economic overtones. Radicals demanded that the
U.S. stop pressuring Korea to open its agricultural markets,
which they said would cripple Korean farmers.
   President Roh Tae Woo acknowledged the public
dissatisfaction with his government and party on Monday,
telling a nationwide television audience that neither has
"been able to gain public confidence in the consistency of
its policies."
   As a result, Mr. Roh said, the nation is facing "an array
of political, economic and social difficulties," and he cited
rampant land speculation, a highly volatile stock market,
labor unrest, an export slump and rising crime. He promised a
crackdown on real-estate speculation as his first priority,
and on Tuesday the government announced measures to force
business groups to sell off idle real estate.
   Wednesday's demonstrations were the most violent since
mid-1987, when nationwide riots forced Mr. Roh's friend and
predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, to abandon his military rule and
promise broad reforms. Mr. Roh was inaugurated to a five-year
term in February 1988.
