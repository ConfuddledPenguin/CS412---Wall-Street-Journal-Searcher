   Two bond-rating services downgraded Domtar Inc.'s debt,
citing weak earnings at the Montreal paper and building
products concern.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded Domtar's senior
secured debt rating to triple-B-minus from triple-B,
affecting about U.S. $250 million of debt. Standard &amp; Poor's
said the "downgrade reflects Domtar's weaker-than-expected
earnings performance in 1989, which has continued into 1990."

   Canadian Bond Rating Service said it cut its ratings on
Domtar's commercial paper to single-A-2 from single-A-1, on
Domtar's debentures to B plus plus (Low) from B plus plus,
and on Domtar's preferred shares to P-3 (Low) from P-3.
   The service said the strength of the Canadian dollar
against the U.S. dollar "exacerbated the overall financial
condition of the company" as prices for paper products
weakened. As well, the rating service said declining
construction activity in North America has hurt Domtar's
building products operations.
