   NEW YORK -- The Treasury sold $10 billion of 30-year bonds
at an unexpectedly low yield of 8.84%, strengthening the
belief among investors that interest rates are heading lower.
   Yesterday's sale completed the Treasury's huge $30.5
billion quarterly note and bond auction, which is closely
watched by Wall Street and Washington for hints of the
direction of interest rates.

   The average yield of 8.84% on the 30-year bonds was the
lowest at an auction since last May, when the yield was
9.11%. And yesterday's yield was even lower than the 8.88%
average yield on the Treasury's 10-year notes that were
auctioned Tuesday. Long-term rates are generally higher than
those with shorter maturities, so the discrepancy reflects
that rates were falling even as the auction proceeded.
   Traders said that a 8.84% yield on the 30-year bond was
possible because large institutional investors rushed to lock
in current interest rates on their belief that U.S. interest
rates are on the way down.
   "We had excellent domestic institutional demand. This was
a good auction," said John Costas, co-manager of government
trading at First Boston Corp. He said, however, that some
dealers may have been disappointed that Japanese demand for
the 30-year bonds was lukewarm. But at First Boston, which
has far more U.S. than foreign customers, "our tenders {bids
from investors} were the strongest in six or seven auctions,"
Mr. Costas said.
   Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Inc., said big investors "are
taking a bullish stance in the marketplace." Mr. Moran noted
that some portfolio managers at insurance companies, pension
funds and mutual funds bought bonds at the auction in an
effort to extend the length of their portfolios, a sign that
these money managers believe the bond market is ready to
rally.
   The success of the government's bond auction is likely to
extend beyond Wall Street. Since other long-term interest
rates often track bond yields, analysts said that some
consumer borrowing costs may begin to ease somewhat.
   "Mortgage rates are coming down even as we speak," said
Paul Havemann, a vice president at HSH Associates, which
compiles mortgages rate information. Mr. Havemann said that
rates on conventional mortgages, which rose from 9.8% in
early January to about 10.6% last week, fell yesterday to
about 10.5% and will probably fall further today. Prior to
the bond auction, economists worried that bond yields would
exceed 9% at the auction, which prompted some mortgage
lenders to raise rates. But now, "just about every lender we
survey said they are cutting rates," said Mr. Havemann.
   Of course, that could change instantly if any new economic
indicators show that inflation is accelerating or that
economic activity is robust. Some news about inflation is due
out today when the Labor Department releases the latest
producer price index, a measure of inflation.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
expect, on average, that the PPI rose 0.2% last month. A much
higher inflation rate could depress the bond market and push
interest rates higher. The PPI declined 0.2% in March and was
flat in February.
   Although yesterday's 30-year bond sale was considered a
relatively good auction, analysts noted that demand was not
as great as in the first two legs of the refunding.
Nonetheless, the 30-year bond traded slightly higher after
the auction, with the yield slipping to 8.81% in when-issued
trading activity.
   Bond dealers estimated that Japanese buyers purchased
between 25% and 30% of the $10 billion of 30-year bonds,
slightly less than estimates of Japanese buying in the
auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   But, "in light of all the fears ahead of the refunding, it
seems to have gone pretty well," said Kathleen Camilli, chief
economist for Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   The government's quarterly bond auction attracted far more
interest than expected among individual investors, who showed
a hearty appetite for the three-year notes sold Tuesday at an
average yield of 8.74% and the 10-year notes sold Wednesday.
   But individuals weren't as big buyers of the 30-year
bonds. The Treasury said it received $463 million of
noncompetitive bids, which come mainly from individual
investors, for the 30-year bonds. That was up modestly from
$442 million of noncompetitive bids at the previous auction
in February.
   One measure of the below-average demand by dealers at the
auction yesterday was the so-called bid-to-cover ratio. The
Treasury received 1.99 bids for every one it accepted at
yesterday's auction. That was down from a bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.0-to-one in the previous six auctions. But bidding at
yesterday's auction was stronger than the last 30-year
auction in February, where the government received 1.84 bids
for every one it accepted.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices ended modestly higher after the
Treasury's 30-year bond sale.
   The current benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/4
point, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield eased to 8.83% from 8.86%.
   Short-term interest rates moved lower. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was 7.72% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 7.96% while the rate on six-month bills was 7.72%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.12%.
   Here are details of yesterday's 30-year bond auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended with strong gains.
   Traders said the advance reflected a modest squeeze on
some dealers, who have been banking on heavy sales of
securities by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   While the RTC did sell mortgage securities late last week
and early this week, the government conservator for failed
thrifts wasn't a sizable seller yesterday.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities
for May delivery ended at 94 22/32, up 14/32, and its 9 1/2%
securities at 97 5/32, up 12/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s 9 1/2% issues was quoted at 96 7/8, up 10/32.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. ended
mixed on news that the publisher has terminated talks for the
sale of certain assets.
   The news, which was released late Wednesday, was
considered negative by most high-yield analysts. However, the
market's reaction didn't turn out to be quite so harsh.
   Although bids for Harcourt Brace junk bonds fell as much
as 3 points in early trading, prices started firming after it
became apparent that there were more buyers than sellers.
   Harcourt's 13% senior notes due in 1997 finished at 93
3/4, slightly higher than Wednesday's closing levels. The
other senior issue of Harcourt junk bonds, the 13 3/4% senior
subordinated debentures maturing in 1999, lost about 1/2
point to end at 77 1/2.
   Both issues had rallied strongly last month on news that
Harcourt was involved in talks with Toronto's Thomson Corp.
for the sale of certain assets.
   Market participants had bid up the senior bonds on the
expectation that if an asset sale took place the company
would use proceeds to retire the bonds at a premium.
   Peter Karches, head of the high-yield department at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., said that despite Wednesday's news, Harcourt
bonds are still attractive on a fundmental basis.
   "People recognize the bonds are trading at relatively
cheap levels," said Karches. "It's going to take more
fundamental news about the company for the bonds to fall."
   Roger Gordon, a high-yield analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp., said the collapse of asset-sale
talks is not critical for a firm like Harcourt Brace.
   "The company is not under the gun to sell assets or
restructure debt," Gordon said. "Our point of view regarding
HBJ's high-yield securities is that the operating cash flow
will be more than sufficient to meet debt service obligations
over the next couple of years."
   Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Interco Inc. were slightly
lower on news that the St. Louis-based furniture and shoe
maker won't make interest payments due June 15 on its bonds.
Instead, the company has proposed that bondholders accept a
debt restructuring of nearly $900 million.
   Interco's 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 2000
lost two points to end at 26. The bonds are now trading
without accrued interest, a sign that the market doesn't
expect the company to make future interest payments.
   Interco's senior bond issue, the 8 7/8% notes of 1993,
were unscathed by yesterday's news, and finished the session
unchanged.
   In the broader market for junk bonds, speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, prices were slightly firmer.
   Investment-grade corporate debt ended generally 1/8 point
higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   New York City drew record demand from Wall Street dealers
yesterday when it auctioned $900 million of revenue
anticipation notes.
   The city said it received 100 bids totaling $9.3 billion
for the notes, which will be used to help the city meet its
financial obligations until it receives funding from the
state. The state aid has been delayed because a New York
state budget has not been adopted.
   Bond dealers said the unusually strong bidding for the
notes, which caused yields to come in lower than expected,
reflects political rather than fundamental factors.
   New York City is currently reviewing its underwriting
team. Therefore, firms eager to illustrate an interest in
doing business with the city submitted bids at yesterday's
auction when they normally might not have done so.
   The largest portion of the notes, $400 million, was won by
a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group. The six other groups
that won portions of the note deal are Dillon Read &amp; Co. with
$200 million; Bear Stearns with $100 million; First Boston
Corp. with $75 million; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and PaineWebber
Inc., each with $50 million; and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. with $25
million.
   Interest rates on the notes, which mature June 29, 1990,
ranged from 6.247% to 6.419%.
   Traders said that New York City notes normally would come
at prices to yield about 6.50%, but a "political bid" pushed
the yields lower, they said.
   In trading yesterday, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds due 2018 rose 3/4 to 97, yielding 7.44%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese Finance Ministry sold 300 billion yen of
20-year bonds yesterday at a coupon rate of 6.8% and at a
price to yield 6.739%.
   Although the event represented the first time the Japanese
government sold 20-year bonds in a year, traders said that
most investors paid little attention to the sale and instead
focused on the U.S. Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds.
   That's because rates on the U.S. Treasury securities are
much higher than rates on comparable Japanese securities. The
new 30-year bonds auctioned yesterday had a coupon rate of
8.75% at a price to yield 8.84%.
   "It would have been better if the coupon (on the Japanese
20-year bond) was 7%," said a dealer at one of the large
Japanese brokerage firms. At that level, he said, the bond
sale would have drawn more enthusiasm from investors.
   The Ministry last issued 20-year bonds in May 1989,
offering 503.2 billion yen of bonds with a coupon rate of 5%.
