   Toronto Dominion Bank said it received approval from the
Federal Reserve to underwrite corporate debt in the U.S.
   The permission given Toronto Dominion to expand its
securities-related activities in the U.S. is similar to
measures approved last January for two other big Canadian
banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, and London-based Barclays Bank PLC.

   In January 1989, the Fed permitted several U.S. banks to
underwrite corporate debt. As with the U.S. concerns, the
foreign banks' securities subsidiaries can generate only 10%
of their revenues from the underwriting of corporate debt,
commercial paper, securities backed by mortgages, consumer
debt and certain municipal bonds.
   L. Arthur English, senior vice president for Toronto
Dominion's U.S. division, said the bank's securities unit,
Toronto Dominion Securities (USA) Inc., will be ready to use
its new powers by Monday.
