   WASHINGTON -- A nationwide campaign to reduce burns from
scalding baths and showers could change plumbing industry
practices and provide a windfall to a small Connecticut
metals company.
   About 5,000 children are scalded by water each year. The
victims are generally young children who are burned
accidentally in the bathtub. Many require expensive
hospitalization and painful skin grafts; some die. Elderly
and handicapped bathers are also particularly susceptible to
hot-water burns, which often occur because many residential
water heaters are set too high.

   The plumbing industry has moved slowly to address this
problem. Although anti-scald devices have been available for
many years, "72% of all bathtub and shower valves sold today
still have no safety or scald protections incorporated into
their design," says William Kamela, the director of public
policy for the National Safe Kids Campaign. In mid-May, Safe
Kids, a child safety organization whose chairman is former
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, plans to launch a campaign
to reduce scalds.
   Safe Kids is working through local coalitions across the
nation to try to win changes in building codes to require the
installation of valves that will shut off water that suddenly
turns dangerously hot. The campaign highlights a safety valve
made by Memry Corp., a small Norwalk, Conn., company.
   The firm makes scald-protection devices that automatically
shut off hot water exceeding 120 degrees (comfortable bath
water runs between 100 degrees and 105 degrees). Safe Kids
argues that safety valves offer the best protection against
water heaters that are set too high or sudden blasts of hot
water that often occur when toilets are flushed in the same
building. On many older water heaters, the temperatures are
set at 140 degrees or higher.
   For both Safe Kids and Memry, their combination is like a
marriage made in heaven. The Memry valves, sold under the
names Shower Gard and Flow Gard, retail for under $20 and are
simple for homeowners to install. More traditional safety
valves cost several times more and require installation by a
plumber.
   The safety campaign, which will include nationwide
advertising and education efforts, promises immediate
benefits to Memry Corp. and its relatively unheralded
products. "There's a great potential. There are 175 million
showers out there," says Stephen Fisher, Memry's president.
Company officials note that when Safe Kids focused on bicycle
safety last year, sales of bicycle helmets nearly doubled.
   (Memry's last moment in the spotlight was considerably
less pleasant. In 1988, the company, then called Memory
Metals Inc., settled Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it had issued misleading news releases while
under different management. Earlier, the company had been the
target of a stock manipulation scheme.)
   Memry is currently scrambling to open channels with such
major retailers as Wal-Mart and K mart. At the same time,
it's trying to interest large plumbing fixture companies in
designing safety faucets around the core of its product -- a
metal alloy spring that rapidly expands to shut off the water
flow as temperatures approach 120 degrees and then returns to
its original shape as temperatures drop.
   One criticism of the safety promotion is that it is
promoting one company's product. Earlier this year, Safe Kids
appeared before the Council of American Building Officials,
which issues a model national building code for one and two
family dwellings, to request a code amendment that would
require showers and tubs in new construction to include "a
point of use temperature sensing device" that shuts off water
flow at 120 degrees. But the council rejected the request, in
part because of concerns that only the Memry product
satisfies that definition. Safe Kids will make another
appearance before the group later this year and seek similar
amendments from other code-drafting bodies.
   Both Safe Kids and Memry acknowledge that the company has
contributed to the anti-scald campaign. But Mr. Kamela says
this hasn't influenced the organization. "We have a $2
million budget. They contributed $15,000," he says. Safe Kids
was established by the Children's National Medical Center in
Washington, and receives most of its funds from Johnson &amp;
Johnson.
   Over the past decade, some concerned doctors and public
health officials around the country have fought with mixed
success to persuade people to turn down their hot water
heaters and to win laws requiring hot water heater
manufacturers to set temperatures lower.
   For years, water-heater makers and plumbers had generally
set water heaters at 140 degrees or higher. At 140 degrees,
water can give a child third-degree burns in three seconds
and scald an adult in five seconds, according to Murray
Katcher, the director of maternal and child health in the
Wisconsin Division of Health. The risk of scalding declines
sharply with water temperatures. "Generally, in the 120-130
range, people are safe," Dr. Katcher says.
   In 1988, after Wisconsin and several other states passed
laws requiring water heater settings at 120 or 125 degrees,
the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, a group that
represents makers of both gas and electric water heaters,
agreed to recommend settings of 120 degrees and to put scald
warning labels on all heaters. But because only about 10% of
the nation's water heaters are replaced each year, most water
is still too hot, Dr. Katcher says.
   Thus, anti-scald groups are pushing safety valves.
"Education isn't nearly as successful as a passive means of
prevention," Dr. Katcher explains.
