   "I AM SICK AT HEART," said Hamlet.
   Who among us hasn't been? Who among us hasn't noticed that
when we are tranquil, our hearts tick peacefully? Or that
when we are excited or frightened, this muscle pounds
violently in our chests?

   Yet surprisingly, the medical establishment has only
recently begun paying more attention to the connection
between emotions and the heart. It's not surprising, they
say, that the symptoms of a panic attack -- an emotionally
traumatic event -- closely parallel those of a heart attack:
chest pains, shortness of breath and nausea.
   Researchers, for instance, are learning more about the
precise way in which stress can damage arteries. They are
developing new models for the type of personality likely to
develop heart disease. And they are advising doctors to treat
-- and be aware of -- patients' emotional, as well as
physical, symptoms.
   One relatively new area of exploration is how the heart
itself can rule our emotions. Researchers know that the
heart, like the brain, stores neurochemicals and hormones of
the sort that help send messages through the nervous system.
The heart occasionally releases such agents into the
bloodstream. This may affect other organs, including the
brain, although researchers aren't sure how.
   "It's suspected but not proven that the heart is a central
command place that mobilizes in time of trouble," says
Stephen Weiss, a heart researcher at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute. "The heart and nervous system {are} all
part of a reverberating circuit with the heart sometimes
directing emotional states."
   A sick heart, for instance, can send emotional warning
signals. Redford Williams, a heart researcher at Duke
University, says that before a heart attack -- and sometimes
right after -- people feel "a sense of doom, despair and
depression." It's believed those feelings may be related to a
poorly functioning heart that isn't pumping as much blood as
usual. "It isn't hard to see how the rest of the body could
perceive this as something wrong," says Dr. Williams.
   Doctors have a better understanding of how emotions
originating in the brain affect the heart. The brain sends
messages to receptors in the heart via the nervous system.
These nerve impulses are analogous to a car engine's power
being transmitted to the wheels. The receptors near the heart
act as both clutch and brake to keep the brain's stronger
impulses from, among other things, fueling the heart into a
pumping frenzy. Heart-attack victims often have nervous
systems that do a poor job of calming themselves.
   When we are scared or angry, nerve impulses also cause
adrenaline, a stimulating hormone, to flow. In response,
blood vessels in the kidneys and near the skin constrict and
muscles get bigger as the body prepares for trouble. The
neurochemicals and hormones triggered by what cardiologists
call "the fight or flight response" are largely used up in
stimulating muscles to high performance.
   But not always. An increasingly popular theory holds that
these chemicals are toxic and that their cumulative effect
causes long-term damage to the arteries. Recent experiments
with monkeys done jointly by Wake Forest University and the
University of Pittsburgh show that emotional stress from the
brain can cause plaque to form on the arteries of some
animals.
   Researchers made the discovery on monkeys who were moved
frequently into new cages, where they were forced to
establish new relationships and be socially aggressive. The
result: arterial plaque. Adding fat to the diet of such
monkeys accelerated the formation of arterial plaque. But
monkeys who exercised by walking on treadmills didn't add
arterial plaque -- presumably because their muscles were
using up the toxic neurochemicals and hormones.
   "If more research proves all this to be true, we're on our
way to understanding the differences between physical and
emotional stress," says Dr. Weiss at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute. "This is an exciting area but one where
we don't have the answers."
   The accumulation of stress-related plaque on the arteries
may be one reason people with certain temperaments are more
likely to die of a heart attack than others. Thus, the big
emotional blowup we so often associate with a heart attack
may be "just the last straw," says Dr. Weiss. Some people may
be overreacting to events dozens of times a day -- each time
contributing to heart problems down the road.
   At the same time, however, doctors have substantially
refined what sort of emotions they think are harmful. One of
the biggest changes is the abandonment of old theories about
the doomed "Type A" personality: the hard-driving, obsessed
workaholic who puts in 70 hours a week. No longer is this
personality by itself seen as being a great risk of coronary
disease. In fact, more recent studies have shown that the
hardest workers may be the healthiest.
   Instead, medical fears are now focusing on those who give
up on their dreams in life and love. "The person who's out of
danger isn't necessarily the one who quits the company to
sell daisies on the roadside. It's the one who's solving
problems at his job and feeling needed by his wife and
children," says Robert S. Eliot, a cardiologist who is
chairman of the Institute of Stress Medicine in Denver.
   Bernard Lown, professor of cardiology at Harvard School of
Public Health, says he learned this lesson the hard way --
from the death of patients. One such man, a 36-year-old truck
driver, complained of chest pains on the job even though he
climbed mountains on vacation without discomfort. "He was
angry about the contradiction in his life -- being bright and
quitting school to end up in a job he didn't like," says Dr.
Lown. He died suddenly at the wheel of his truck.
   Another of Dr. Lown's patients complained of chest pain
whenever his phone rang at about 10 a.m., the hour when he
previously received word of his son's death. The patient
eventually had a fatal heart attack one morning when the
phone rang.
   Physicians must minister more carefully to the emotions of
patients, says Dean Ornish, a cardiovascular researcher at
the University of California School of Medicine at San
Francisco. He notes that 50% of heart-attack victims die in
the first 24 hours. He wonders whether impersonal treatment
in emergency rooms -- with cold catheters and cool
calculations by doctors -- unnecessarily raises patients'
anxieties and hurts their chances for survival.
   "The heart-attack patient typically suffers depression --
a sense of doom and loss," says Dr. Ornish. "They're deeply
personal feelings that the poets have felt but medical
science just can't explain. Emergency treatment has to do
more to relieve the sense of fear and helplessness."
   Feelings of powerlessness can bring on a heart attack,
recent research shows. A Harvard study of 117 victims of
sudden coronary death shows that 25 had "trigger events"
within 24 hours of the heart attack. They included a man
giving a speech being jeered by his audience, a man whose
wife surprised him with a divorce request, and a patient who
became enraged in a traffic jam.
   Indeed, many doctors now believe that emotional stresses
are far more likely to trigger a heart attack than are
physical demands. In a study of 28- to 35-year-old aerospace
engineers at Cape Canaveral, their rate of death was three
times higher than the rate for the rest of Florida's
population, including retirees. The mysterious deaths even
attracted attention from the Central Intelligence Agency,
suspecting sabotage. But researchers learned the engineers
were dying after major rocket launches, when layoffs
sometimes occur.
   "One week they're working on rockets and the next week
they're bagging groceries," says the Institute of Stress
Medicine's Dr. Eliot, who studied the engineers. "I found
that in most of the deceased, the coronary arteries were in
pretty good shape."
   But he also discovered ruptures of heart-muscle fibers
that other researchers have duplicated in animal experiments
with overdoses of adrenaline, a stress hormone. Among other
things, adrenaline constricts arteries in the arms and leg;
it's the reason your hands may feel cold in stressful times,
and it's the principle that allows "stress cards" to change
color as blood vessels tighten and relax.
   Interviewing colleagues of the dead engineers, Dr. Eliot
learned that many of the heart-attack victims shared a fear
of losing four things: jobs, self-esteem, personal identities
and control of their lives.
   A momentary flare-up of disappointment and frustration is
more dangerous than fatigue from long hours or job pressure.
A recent study at Yale University shows that
heart-threatening stress has nothing to do with job
involvement or ambition. "The vulnerable ones are those who
become too annoyed at waiting in a restaurant line or being
seated near a cigar smoker when they get in," says Lynda
Powell, a psychologist and researcher at Yale. Her study of
people with recurring heart attacks shows they share
"annoyance, impatience . . . a feeling that there's someone
against them and there's a paucity of time."
   On the more hopeful side, there is now growing evidence
that stress-management techniques can reduce plaque in
partially clogged arteries. Findings last year by researchers
in Houston and San Francisco showed that meditation and talk
therapy reduced coronary-arterty blockages in a group of 24
patients -- some of whom had already had heart attacks.
   Still, much needs to be learned. Dr. Ornish says that not
enough research is under way on the emotions that affect the
heart-or how to control them-especially in comparison to the
work being done on diet and exercise. Adds Harvard's Dr.
Lown: "The public comes to the doctor with an aching heart .
. . a no-good son or a bad boss, and he often ignores it."
