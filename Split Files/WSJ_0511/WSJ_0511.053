   LONDON -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., struggling
to expand abroad, aims to form a chain of computer-sales
partnerships around Western Europe over the next year or two,
a top AT&amp;T executive said.
   Robert M. Kavner, head of AT&amp;T's world-wide computer
business, said the company is talking with a number of
European companies about possible mergers, joint ventures or
other forms of alliance. He didn't name prospective partners,
but said they include medium-sized computer software and
"systems integration" companies in France, West Germany,
Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. A systems integrator
tailors big computer systems to fit individual customers.

   "We plan to go country-by-country" around Western Europe,
forming national partnerships to build a distribution network
for AT&amp;T computers, Mr. Kavner said in an interview here.
   AT&amp;T's previous strategy was more multinational: It tried
to expand in Europe through a tempestuous partnership with
Italian-based Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co., acting as AT&amp;T's
computer distributor throughout Europe. That alliance was
scaled back in 1988, with each side blaming the other for
disappointing results. As a result, Europe now provides just
5% of AT&amp;T's world-wide computer revenue of $2 billion a
year.
   As the first public step in its new country-by-country
strategy, AT&amp;T unveiled plans Thursday to try boosting
computer sales in Britain and Ireland. AT&amp;T Istel Ltd., a
British-based computer company that AT&amp;T bought last year for
#180 million ($302.3 million), launched a new subsidiary to
sell AT&amp;T's full range of U.S.-designed computer products in
Britain and Ireland. Currently, AT&amp;T is a miniscule player in
the British market, selling computers partly through
Olivetti's U.K. unit. The Olivetti link will continue, but is
expected to diminish in importance to AT&amp;T as Istel grows.
   At a news conference here and in a subsequent interview,
Mr. Kavner appeared at pains to reassure skittish clients and
partners about AT&amp;T's commitment to Europe. In the wake of
AT&amp;T's failure with Olivetti, European industry gossips have
been buzzing with speculation about how or whether AT&amp;T can
expand its computer business in Europe. "This isn't a shot in
the dark," Mr. Kavner said of the Istel venture. "AT&amp;T is
here for the long term."
   Expanded European sales, Mr. Kavner added, are an
important part of his overall goal to get at least half of
the company's computer revenue outside the U.S. by 2000.
Currently, 90% of AT&amp;T computer revenue come from its home,
U.S. market. He said he is also pushing to boost sales in
Asia, through local partnerships there.
   Industry analysts remain skeptical about AT&amp;T's prospects
in Europe, however. Compared to when it began its Olivetti
alliance, AT&amp;T will benefit from a much broader range of
computer products and from growing market demand for AT&amp;T's
strongest suit: products that run on the Unix software
system, an industry standard invented by AT&amp;T. But the new,
country-by-country approach may take too long and consume too
much management time, analysts said.
   "When you start looking at alliances with everybody and
his dog, you've got to worry about each individual operation
working out well -- which complicates matters," said analyst
Susan Anthony, of London-based Robert Fleming Securities Ltd.
She added that AT&amp;T doesn't "have the best track record in
the world {on alliances} after their fling with Olivetti."
   But Mr. Kavner said there were "a lot of lessons learned
with Olivetti" -- including the need to avoid cultural
misunderstandings between partners from different countries.
And his country-by-country strategy was apparently forced by
circumstances. The opportunities for pan-European
partnerships are few, he indicated. He said AT&amp;T approached
some multinational systems-integration companies in Europe
about alliances, but none were interested. And he indicated
AT&amp;T isn't eager for another Olivetti-style alliance with a
big European computer maker. Such a company would already
have its own range of products to sell, conflicting with
AT&amp;T's range.
   "We have computers. What we don't have in Europe is
distribution," Mr. Kavner said.
   AT&amp;T executives point to its Istel venture in Britain as
one possible model for how its European business will grow.
Istel, the former computer division of British auto maker
Rover Group Ltd., is a relatively small systems integrator,
but one with a good reputation and such blue-chip British
clients as Rover and retailer Dixons Group PLC. Since AT&amp;T's
acquisition last year, Istel officials say, the U.S. company
has been lavish with the time and money needed to expand
Istel into a major U.K. market force.
   Mr. Kavner said he expects Istel's revenue within five
years to grow to "several hundred millions of pounds"
annually. In 1989, Istel revenue totaled #108 million.
