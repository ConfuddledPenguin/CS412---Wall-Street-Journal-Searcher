   SEOUL -- South Korea's 10 largest business groups pledged
Thursday to cooperate with a strict government order
requiring them to sell excessive real estate holdings within
six months.
   The businesses, which include Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar,
Daewoo, Lotte, Ssangyong and Sunkyong, also agreed to donate
1% of pretax business profits to create an employee welfare
fund and to use their resources to build apartments for their
workers.

   Lee Kun-hee, chairman of the Samsung Group, made the
announcement on behalf of the 10 business groups at a news
conference. The heads of the other groups also attended.
   He said the proposed sales would involve 5,140 hectares
scattered throughout the country, roughly 15% of their total
real estate holdings. Under the agreement, all land not sold
by the six-month deadline will be transferred to a
state-owned development agency at prices set by the
government.
   Among the 10 groups, Samsung stands to sell the most
holdings, roughly 18.9 million square meters, followed by
Sunkyong's 10.3 million, Lucky-Goldstar's 4.6 million,
Ssangyong's 3.6 million and Hyundai's 3.3 million.
   The group owners also pledged to do their best to overcome
what they termed the critical condition of South Korea's
economy.
   Thursday's announcement came two days after the government
ordered the nation's 49 leading business groups to sell by
year's end millions of dollars in real estate they are
holding for speculation or don't urgently need for their
business operations. The government said businesses that fail
to abide by the order will face stiff taxes and a cutoff in
fresh bank loans.
