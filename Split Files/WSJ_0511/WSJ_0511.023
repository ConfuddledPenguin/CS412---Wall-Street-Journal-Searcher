   WHEN IT COMES to searching for new treatments for heart
disease, U.S. pharmaceutical makers aren't pikers. In 1988
they invested nearly one-third of the $6.5 billion they spent
on all research and development looking for medicines for the
heart.
   The incentives are huge. Nearly 66 million Americans, or
one in four, suffer some type of cardiovascular problem, and
more than one million people are expected to die from such
ailments this year. Last year, 48 drug companies were
developing 91 medicines to treat patients with diseased
hearts and coronary arteries, hypertension and stroke.

   For all the work in the field, none of these experimental
compounds are cures. At best, these medicines are more potent
and produce fewer side effects than existing therapies. None
of them can reverse the damage to the heart and its arteries
caused by decades of high blood pressure, the clogging of
arteries by fatty plaques or the killing of heart muscle
caused by a heart attack.
   But scientists say advances taking place in a few dozen
laboratories suggest that by the end of the century drug
makers will be testing medicines designed to reverse the
course of disease.
   "The important new drugs in the future won't just
ameliorate disease but, instead, will prevent the
physiological changes that, over time, lead to high blood
pressure, heart attacks and angina," says Jay Cohn, a leading
heart-disease researcher at the University of Minnesota
School of Medicine. "Such drugs will profoundly affect the
frequency of disease by inhibiting disease at the most basic,
cellular level in the body."
   Driving this optimism is the rapid pace at which
scientists are uncovering the inner workings of cells that,
when in proper condition, keep the cardiovascular system
running efficiently. Principal targets for this research are
receptors, spikelike chemicals on the surface of cells
through which hormones and enzymes control thousands of
minute actions taking place instantaneously.
   It is widely believed that defects in these receptors,
often caused by mutated genes, underlie most heart disease.
The important heart drugs of the future will repair these
defects, scientists predict.
   Scientists are convinced the decadeslong buildup of fatty
deposits that eventually block blood flow to the heart --
causing angina and heart attacks -- occurs only in people
born with one of about a dozen receptor defects. The most
effective drugs now under study for lowering cholesterol work
by coaxing certain receptors to soak up excess cholesterol in
the bloodstream. Already one such drug is available --
Mevacor, produced Merck &amp; Co. A half-dozen similar drugs are
in advanced stages of testing.
   "The challenge to developing even better drugs is to get
at the other receptors involved in normal cholesterol
processing," says Edgar Haber, the director of research at
Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp. "If we knew exactly which
receptors were defective in an individual, we could tailor
very potent drugs that, given early in life, would go a long
way toward preventing disease."
   Dr. Haber says researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb also
are chasing after cell receptors that normally regulate the
musclelike tissue surrounding coronary arteries. Drugs that
can affect these receptors, thereby relaxing the muscle
tissue, could keep the arteries from constricting, thus
treating a common type of angina. It is hoped that these
drugs would be targeted specifically at receptors near the
heart, thus avoiding the side effects of current
vessel-dilating drugs that work throughout the body.
   Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Upjohn Co.,
SmithKline Beecham PLC. and elsewhere have been racing for
several years to create drugs that would block the action of
renin, a kidney hormone. Renin is known to turn on numerous
receptors that control cells involved in the pumping action
of the heart. Scientists believe a renin-inhibiting drug
would be a potent treatment for high blood pressure and also
would reduce the workload burdening hearts that have been
severely weakened by a heart attack.
   To date, the hunt for a useful renin blocker has failed.
Instead, scientists now are pursuing compounds that interact
directly with the renin receptors. It might be possible to
administer such drugs beginning early in life to repair
inborn receptor defects.
   But, the scientists say, breakthroughs in receptor
technology must also be accompanied by better methods at
detecting which individuals have specific receptor defects.
One technique will rely on the growing ability for scientists
to test a person's genetic material to determine whether a
gene responsible for the production of a particular receptor
is damaged. Another technique will depend on whether
scientists can create imaging devices that can see the
buildup of artery plaque or constricted vessels years before
the first dangerous signs of disease appear.
   "When that happens, and most everyone in the field
believes it will," says Dr. Cohn of Minnesota, "we will have
moved into a new age of disease prevention much better than
anything we can do now."

   Here's a listing of some of the major drug groups and some
of the more commonly used drugs to treat problems caused by
cardiovascular disease. This is not a complete list ofall
drugs; such a list would go on forever. Indeed, products
often combine many of these drugs.

shouldn't be taken with beta blockers; can cause dizziness,
nausea, constipation and headaches.
   Monthly cost: $22

   Believes the pain of angina by opening coronary arteries,
thus increasing blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle.
(Drug is available in many forms -- in a chewable dosage, in
a form to be placed under the tongue, or topically, as a
cream or through a Band-Aid-like skin patch.)

health of a heart-attack survivor. The drugs differ in speed
of action, length ofactivity, mode of administration and

effectiveness.

of an attack. Can only be administered via injection in a
hospital. Can cause unwanted bleeding and must be closely
monitored.
   Cost: $200 to $2,000 per dose

internal bleeding.
