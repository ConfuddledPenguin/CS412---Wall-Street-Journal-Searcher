   Home decor should show one's personality,
   So from rugs and walls to couch,
   My family's suggesting we do our place
   In a style called
   Early Grouch.

   Verse Luck
                                                                                                       

   I'm strict on scanning,
   And rhythm and rhyme;
   I follow the rules
   Each and every time.
   I rigidly avoid
   Any writing offense --
   Except that, at times,
   The poem makes no sense.
   -- Joshua Adams.
