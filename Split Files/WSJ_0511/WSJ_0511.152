   Britain's biggest oil company saw net in the quarter drop
to #344 million ($578 million) from #608 million ($1.02
billion) the year earlier. These figures are on a
historic-cost basis, which values inventories at the cost of
acquisition. They include a #19 million inventory loss,
compared with a #234 million gain a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings dropped 38% to 6.4 pence (10.7 cents)
from 10.3 pence.
   On a replacement-cost basis, which excludes the effect of
inventory gains or losses, net fell a more modest 5.2% to
#361 million from #381 million.
   Sales jumped to #8.86 billion from #6.53 billion.
   Despite the earnings slide, the company said it would
increase its first-quarter dividend to 3.95 pence from 3.65
pence.
