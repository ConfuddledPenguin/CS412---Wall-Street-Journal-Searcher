   SEATTLE, Wash. -- Immunex Corp. scientists shed new light
on the role of the immune system in the rejection of
transplanted organs.
   The company said mouse studies indicate that a molecular
sponge for the protein interleukin-1 (IL-1) can inhibit
rejection of heart transplants without harmful side effects,
such as kidney damage and blocked arteries, that can result
from currently approved immunosuppressive drugs.

   The agent is a soluble form of the IL-1 receptor, the cell
surface protein to which IL-1 attaches itself, thus signaling
the immune system to martial cells to attack a foreign
invader, such as a transplanted organ. Sometimes when the
immune response goes awry, those same immune system signals
attack the host's own tissues, as in auto-immune disease.
   The soluble IL-1 receptor works by sopping up the body's
IL-1 before it has a chance to trigger an unwanted immune
reaction. It is one of five such receptor-based products now
under development by the company's Receptech unit.
   Immunex said it plans to launch human clinical trials of
the IL-1 receptor in 1991, with an eye toward developing the
agent as a treatment for transplant rejection,
graft-versus-host disease, and auto-immune diseases such as
arthritis.
   The research, reported in the current issue of the journal
Science, said survival of heart grafts in mice was prolonged
to 17 days in treated mice, from 12 days in untreated control
animals.
