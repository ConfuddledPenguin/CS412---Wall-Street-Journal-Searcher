   WASHINGTON -- Propelled by an increase in retail and
bank-card borrowing, consumer credit grew at a 4.4% annual
rate in March, the Federal Reserve Board reported.
   Consumer debt rose $2.62 billion in March, following a
revised $62 million increase in February, the Fed said. The
February increase was originally reported to be $3.42
billion.

   Revolving credit, which consists mainly of retail and
bank-card debt, rose $2.02 billion in March, or at an annual
rate of 12.1%. The March increase follows February's
slowdown, when revolving credit rose a revised $786 million,
or at a 4.7% annual rate. The March figures resemble
borrowing activity in January, when revolving credit rose a
revised $2.16 billion.
   The increase in revolving credit is in line with what
Rosiland Wells, chief economist of the National Retail
Merchants Association, said she has been hearing from
retailers.
   "The larger picture is one of expansion in the consumer
area," said Ms. Wells. Although consumers are less confident
about buying and borrowing today then they were a year ago,
Ms. Wells said she hasn't seen any data indicating consumers
are overburdened.
   Automobile loans increased $1.81 billion, or at a 7.5%
annual rate, in March, following a $1.27 billion drop in
February.
   Overall, economists had different interpretations of the
report, which is known for its volatility.
   Joan Schneider, senior domestic economist at Continental
Bank National Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said the report isn't a
valuable measure of total consumer borrowing from month to
month, because home-equity loans aren't included.
   "The revised numbers, showing a small increase, are
probably more in line with other indicators on consumer
spending," Ms. Schneider said. She later added that consumers
are willing to spend and borrow when the price is right.
   However, Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security
Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, said consumer
confidence is declining, and she predicted a decline in
purchases of big-ticket items that require consumer
borrowing. "I think consumer spending is going to slow down
in the second half of this year," Ms. Cooper said.
   At the end of March, outstanding consumer credit stood at
$705.99 billion, compared with $680.73 billion a year
earlier.
