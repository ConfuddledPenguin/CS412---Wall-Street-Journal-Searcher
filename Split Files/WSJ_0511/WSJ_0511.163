   Sears PLC, a U.K. retailing, property and investment
concern that owns the London department store Selfridges,
said pretax profit fell 15% for the year ended Jan. 31, with
earnings declines in all divisions.
   Sears, which isn't related to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., said
pretax profit dropped to #231.4 million ($388.6 million) from
#272.8 million ($458.2 million). The decline wasn't as deep
as market predictions, which ranged between #195 million and
#205 million.

   Profit after tax, less minority interests, was #167
million, down 9.8% from #185.1 million a year earlier.
Per-share earnings declined 9.7% to 11.1 pence (19 cents)
from 12.3 pence (21 cents).
   The company said that the first quarter of 1990 is
"showing an encouraging trend in sales" but "the economic
climate is not likely to improve significantly in the current
year."
