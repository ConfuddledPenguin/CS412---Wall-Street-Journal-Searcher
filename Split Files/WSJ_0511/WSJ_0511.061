   New York -- The job of putting on one orchestral premiere
is daunting enough for most musicians, but four in a single
concert, all of them for flute, smacks of artist masochism.
Nonetheless, flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson recently
brought his Solisti New York Chamber Orchestra together with
three other prominent flutists for just such a blowout in
Town Hall.
   The concert was the culmination of a project that began
several years ago, when Mr. Wilson and fellow flutists Carol
Wincenc and Paula Robison applied for a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts to commission works from
three composers. Each flutist would play all the concertos
and premiere one, thereby ensuring at least three
performances of each work. After some haggling, the trio
tapped Joseph Schwantner ("an established composer,"
according to Mr. Wilson), Robert Beaser ("a new kid on the
block") and Paul Schoenfield ("someone from out of left
field").

   Only Mr. Beaser finished his piece, "Song of the Bells,"
on schedule, and Ms. Wincenc premiered it with the St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra in 1987. Cut to 1989-90. Mr. Wilson and
Solisti New York have come to an agreement with Town Hall,
the only presenter in New York willing to take on an evening
of new flute concertos, and they have a concert date. To
round out the program, they have added futuristic flutist
Robert Dick performing his own new concerto. A recording for
New World is lined up. So where are the other concertos? Uhh
. . . they're coming along. Mr. Wilson realizes that
conducting four new works and playing one will probably send
him round the bend, so he enlists the services of Alasdair
Neale, assistant conductor of the San Francisco Symphony,
former flute player, and a crack new-music learner. A few
months before the concert, Ms. Wincenc has the solo part of
the Schoenfield concerto. A week before the concert, the
orchestral parts arrive. "They were full of errors," Mr.
Wilson says. "There were no meters in the score, no bar
lines. . . . Alasdair likes a challenge, but . . . ."
   Conductors are used to the last-minute nature of
premieres, but they don't usually have to deal with more than
one dilatory composer at a time. The entire Schwantner
concerto also showed up about a week before the performance,
and it was hard.
   "Luckily it was beautifully copied and there were no
revisions," Mr. Wilson says. There were other surprises as
well. "No matter what you ask for, you get something
different," says Mr. Wilson of the orchestrations originally
specified in the commissions. The Beaser piece required four
horns. "If the composer says, all I need is one more horn to
make a masterpiece, can you say no?" Mr. Wilson asks. Mr.
Dick's piece called for steel drums, and steel drum sets
aren't uniform in the location of pitches on the instrument.
"Two days before the concert, our percussionists got the
drums and the parts and freaked out," Mr. Wilson recalls.
   Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos" needed a saxophone,
tuba and trombone for its klezmer band, which was ostensibly
meant to suggest the sound of East European Jewish villages
of yore. It also required a singer.
   Five rehearsals, up from the usual three, weren't enough,
but the orchestra coped obligingly with the messy parts and
frequent changes. "They are an easygoing group," Mr. Wilson
says.
   The evening, as you might have supposed, turned out to be
a study of contrasting flute style. After an elegant
performance of Ives's "The Unanswered Question," with the
four flutists (covering all the original wind parts)
responding to the trumpet soloist in the balcony, Ms. Robison
took the stage for Mr. Beaser's "Song of the Bells." The
orchestra laid out a cushioned, exotic tapestry of sound,
from which Ms. Robison, ever a direct and uncomplicated
performer, soared triumphant, like a breath of clear air.
   Mr. Dick's New York club-style attire -- green jacket,
white-spotted black shirt and tie -- announced that his
"Concerto for Flute/Bass Flute, Strings and Percussion" was
going to be from a different musical planet. No more tonal
romanticism: Here was the flute making whistles, multiple
tones and noises like escaping steam. Mr. Dick's eerie sounds
were picked up and amplified by the sound of a violin bow
drawn across a xylophone, and they gathered momentum for the
syncopated, jocular finale. The thud of the bass flute cut
through any preconceptions about the ethereal sound of the
instrument. What noise will he make next, one wondered. The
effect was engaging, but more curious and entertaining than
expressive.
   With Mr. Schwantner's "A Play of Shadows," Mr. Wilson
returned us to the tonal universe. Here again, as in the
Beaser concerto, a harp in the orchestra provided a foil for
the flute. The concerto sounded a lot like Mr. Schwantner's
other pieces; the symmetrical form and the opening and
closing glissandos recalled "A Sudden Rainbow." But
soft-edged, coloristic and Schwantnerian as it was, it was
also more rhythmically jaunty than the Beaser concerto. Mr.
Wilson gave the virtuosic solo part a nuanced intensity.
   The finale, Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos," was indeed
a voice from the shtetl: Yiddish folk melodies in the flute,
a wailing saxophone, a slow, circus march with tambourine,
and finally, the flute commenting on a despairing Yiddish
text about a beautiful, cold girl who comes to a sad end,
sung by a baritone, Douglas Webster. The piece was packed
with local color and entertainment, though the vocal part
didn't add much. Ms. Wincenc, resplendent in a red gown, and
with an edge and abandon to her flute playing, lent an air of
drama to the evening.
   The three commissions have been recorded (Mr. Dick's piece
wasn't included because it hadn't been part of the original
deal, and it wouldn't have fit into the basically tonal cast
of the recording), and the three flutists are now looking for
other places to perform the concertos. Mr. Wilson is happy
with the commissioning experience and says John Adams,
Michael Torke, and John Harbison have all promised him
concertos. Whether he would take on four premieres at a go
again is another question. "If you'd asked me the day before
the concert, I'd have said never again," he says. "But now --
well, sure."
