   NEW YORK -- Reuters Holdings PLC said its Instinet Corp.
subsidiary introduced 40 French and 30 German "blue chip"
stocks to its electronic stock-trading network.
   All transactions will occur in the local currency. Quotes
on the stocks will come from SEAQ International, but that
will cover only 37 of the French issues and 17 of the German
shares.
