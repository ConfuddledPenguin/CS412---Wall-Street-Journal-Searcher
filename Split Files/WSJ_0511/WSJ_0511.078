   NEW YORK -- The Swiss franc rose against the dollar,
pulling the mark up with it, while profit-taking steadied the
U.S. unit against most other currencies after sharp losses
Wednesday.
   Large-scale selling of yen for Swiss francs helped the
dollar post modest gains against the yen, traders said.

   The Swiss unit, which was extending recent gains, remains
in strong demand because of high Swiss interest rates,
dealers said.
   The currency also is benefiting from a market perception
of Switzerland as an economically and politically stable
country in which to invest. This perception is helping
Switzerland draw a healthy portion of the capital that
currently is flowing into Europe from the U.S., said Judy
Rubenstein, a vice president and trader at Bank of America in
Los Angeles.
   The Swiss unit is getting further support from Japanese
borrowers who need the currency to pay off maturing
franc-denominated bonds, Ms. Rubenstein and other
participants said.
   Traders said that Japanese buying of the Swiss unit late
last month brought the franc out of the obscurity it had
suffered while the market focused on German unification.
However, the franc's original upward pressure against the yen
was broadened by a high-profile campaign conducted by the
Swiss National Bank on behalf of the currency, they added.
   The franc ended the New York day at 112.63 yen, up a full
yen from 111.63 yen late Wednesday in New York.
   The Swiss National Bank, which sets the Swiss Lombard
interest rate, has said repeatedly it will take whatever
measures are necessary to keep the franc strong, a policy
that has included maintaining comparatively high interest
rates.
   The Swiss National Bank's Lombard rate stood yesterday at
10.875%, unchanged from its level Wednesday.
   The mark also weakened against the Swiss franc, falling to
0.8524 franc from 0.8567 franc in trading late Wednesday in
New York. However, the franc and mark tend to move in a
roughly parallel direction against the dollar, so some of the
Swiss franc's gains against the U.S. unit spilled over to the
German currency. Sterling fell to 2.3342 francs from 2.3533
francs.
   While the dollar rebounded slightly against most
currencies yesterday on some buying of the U.S. unit at its
lower levels and modest profit-taking in other currencies,
market sentiment on the U.S. currency remains bearish,
participants said.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6285 marks, down from 1.6360 marks late Wednesday, and
at 156.70 yen, up from 156.50 yen late Wednesday. Sterling
was quoted at $1.6795, up from $1.6785 Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 154.80 yen, down sharply from Thursday's Tokyo
close of 156.75 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at
about 1.6300 marks.
   Market worry is focused on the possibility of lower
interest rates following Friday's disappointing employment
report for April, a concern that has been sharpened by
renewed efforts by President Bush and Congress to reduce the
federal budget deficit. It's feared that a lower deficit will
lead to pressure for lower interest rates.
   News that the Treasury's $10 billion of 30-year bonds sold
at an average yield of 8.84% came too late in the day to
influence trading.
   Bearishness about the U.S. currency is such that
participants are willing to sell the U.S. unit at the
smallest opportunity. This was seen late in the day when
traders sold the dollar against the mark following a gain by
the Swiss franc against the U.S. currency, said Francoise
Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president at Credit Suisse in New
York.
   "There's a contagion of anti-dollar feeling," in the
market, Ms. Soares-Kemp said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370.10 an ounce, down $1.80. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $371.55 an ounce.
