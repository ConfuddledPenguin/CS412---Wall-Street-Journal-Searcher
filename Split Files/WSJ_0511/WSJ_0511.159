   Audi AG's 1989 profit jumped 51% to 228 million marks
($139.4 million) from 151 million marks in 1988 on sales of
12.2 billion marks, the company said.
   The luxury car unit of auto maker Volkswagen AG, which
Wednesday said its group profit climbed 33% in 1989, said the
pretax profit margin climbed to 5.2% from 3.6% a year
earlier.

   Audi said that in the first quarter world-wide sales rose
0.7% to 105,327 vehicles. Domestic unit sales, however,
declined 0.7% to 39,351. Audi said its domestic market share
fell to 5.3% from 5.7%.
   In the U.S., unit sales climbed 7% to 4,949 in the first
quarter. But Wednesday, Volkswagen Chairman Carl H. Hahn said
that in the first four months, Audi unit sales had risen 14%,
suggesting sales jumped sharply in April.
   Sales in the U.S. had been hurt in recent years by
since-discredited allegations that Audi cars had spontaneous
acceleration problems. Signs that Audi's U.S. sales had
turned the corner emerged in 1989.
