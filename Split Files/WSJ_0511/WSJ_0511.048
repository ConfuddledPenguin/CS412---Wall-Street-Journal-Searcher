   Eastern Airlines abruptly pulled its $45 million
advertising account from Lintas, awarding it -- without the
usual step of putting the account up for review -- to Ogilvy
&amp; Mather.
   The shift of the huge account came as a surprise to the ad
industry. Typically, an account move of that size takes
months, and follows a detailed review process in which a
number of agencies are invited to compete for the business.
But Texas Air's Eastern unit, under its new bankruptcy
trustee Martin Shugrue, "wanted to make a new beginning," he
said in a statement. Mr. Shugrue has already switched other
suppliers, including lawyers and financial advisers, in a bid
to make a clean sweep and distance himself from Texas Air.

   The loss is a cruel one for Interpublic Group unit Lintas,
which had just given a new advertising presentation to Mr.
Shugrue a week ago. "We're just furious, but there's nothing
we can do about it," said Spencer Plavoukos, chairman and
chief executive officer of Lintas's New York office, which
handled the account. "What makes it so frustrating is we know
the people {at Eastern} are behind us. This is a one-man
decision. He answers to nobody but the {bankruptcy-court}
judge."
   For WPP Group's Ogilvy, however, the account is even more
significant than an ordinary big account win. Ogilvy's New
York office, which will handle the account, hadn't won a
major new piece of business for more than two years. Losses
have mounted, including the Seagram wine cooler business
earlier this year. Morale has been poor and new business
efforts have been fruitless. The endless march of problems
led to the departure last month of Michael Lesser, who had
headed the office.
   "The drought is over," said Graham Phillips, Ogilvy's
chairman and chief executive officer. "It's going to start
pouring again."
   Ogilvy's win shows just how important contacts and
personal friendships can be in the ad business. The agency
snared the business after hiring several former associates of
Mr. Shugrue. Last weekend it gave Mr. Shugrue a presentation
in which it talked about its credentials and offered some
rough ideas about creative concepts. No other agencies were
invited to pitch to Eastern, nor were others even aware that
Eastern wanted to switch agencies.
   Mr. Shugrue was familiar with Ogilvy, though, through a
number of personal ties. He knows William Gray, an Ogilvy
senior vice president who had worked on an airline account
before. Ogilvy also recently hired two of Mr. Shugrue's
former associates. It brought in George Zuckerman, who had
once worked at Ayer, which had handled the account for
Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air. Mr. Shugrue is a
former president of Continental. And Ogilvy hired as a
consultant James O'Donnell, a former Continental marketing
executive who had worked closely with Mr. Shugrue.
   Ogilvy's Mr. Phillips agreed that "we know Marty from
previous lives. He knew some of our people and knew of us."
But he said that Ogilvy won the account because of its "very
good track record and a terrific direct response outfit." He
said Eastern didn't bother with a formal agency review
"because obviously they're in a big hurry. They have a lot to
do in a short period of time. In {Mr. Shugrue's} situation,
you have to move quickly."
   For Lintas, the loss is something of a double hit. In
March, it looked as if Lintas might have a shot of handling
both the Eastern and the Continental accounts, an
unprecedented coup for an ad agency. At the time,
Continental's ad account was up for review, and Lintas was
believed to be a frontrunner. But the agency ultimately lost
out to Wells, Rich, Greene. Now, Lintas is out in the cold,
without any airline account at all.
   Eastern's most recent advertising varied from region to
region, with most talking about special prices. But the ads
all revolved around the theme, "We're building a better
airline." Lintas's Mr. Plavoukos said it was "too early to
assess" possible layoffs, but said that Lintas is involved in
some new business pitches, and "I don't anticipate there will
be very many people let go. What I'm shooting for is zero."

   Burger King Gets Newman
                                                                                                       

   Burger King signed actor Paul Newman to appear in a new TV
ad campaign.
   But there's a twist: Mr. Newman will appear in the ads in
clips from a number of films in which he has starred. Mr.
Newman wouldn't agree to appear on camera in the spots, which
tout the arrival of the actor's salad dressings in Burger
King restaurants.
   Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, wouldn't
say which of Mr. Newman's films, which include "The Color of
Money," "The Sting" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"
have been excerpted for the commercials.
   "We are thrilled to be associated with Paul Newman," a
spokeswoman said. The ads, which will begin airing later this
month, were created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, a unit
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.
   Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. The actor has donated
all of the proceeds from the sale of his salad dressing to
charities, and sales of the product at Burger King will also
be donated, the spokeswoman said.
   The Burger King ad contract marks the second major
advertising deal this year for Mr. Newman, a star whom many
industry observers once believed would never appear in
commercials. His first commercial in the U.S., which aired in
January, was for American Express.

   EATING OUT: McDonald's tonight will begin airing
commercials with a new theme, "Food, folks and fun," to

Leo Burnett, Chicago, is McDonald's agency.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Woodbridge,
N.J., named M.E.D. Communications, New York, to develop ads
for the launch of an anti-hypertensive drug. Billings are $10
million. . . . Ford Dealer Associations in Dallas and El
Paso, Texas, and Oklahoma City, named W.B. Doner, Detroit, to
handle ad accounts totaling $5 million. . . . Activision,
which publishes video games for Nintendo Entertainment
System, chose Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre, San
Francisco, for its $1 million account.
