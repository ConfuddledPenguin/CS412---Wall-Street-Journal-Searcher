   DEMOCRATS DISPUTE their leaders' push for a budget summit
with Bush.
   House Democrats are particularly outspoken about Speaker
Foley's eagerness for the bipartisan talks. White House talk
about Bush's unchanged no-new-taxes stance fuels the unrest.
Many Democrats want Bush to give his ideas first. "The
starting line has yet to be crossed because the president has
not made any statement of what he wants," says New Jersey
Sen. Bradley.

   New York Rep. Schumer says House leaders are
"appropriately cautious of the potential political trap." But
Senate Budget Chairman Sasser warns that with all of the
lawmakers "negotiating with what is essentially one person,
the president, he always has the upper hand." Democrats say
they have little choice but to go ahead now.
   "Everything's on the table, but I guess the question is
who is going to serve?" says Congressional Budget Office
Director Bob Reischauer.
                                                                                                       

   A BUDGET COMPROMISE nears to head off sharp defense
personnel cuts.
   Breaking months of stalemate, the Pentagon and
congressional leaders move toward switching about $800
million to personnel from defense procurement and operating
accounts. The money is needed to avoid freezing military
promotions and laying off as many as 60,000 civilian workers.
Defense officials see the expected compromise as a victory
for Cheney.
   But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Aspin also
would succeed in spreading cuts over more defense programs.
And lawmakers eventually seem sure to cut uniformed personnel
more deeply than Cheney has proposed. Even top Pentagon
planners now concede that the Army and Air Force are likely
to be 25% smaller by 1996.
                                                                                                       

   ALARM GROWS among Bush advisers about Soviet uncertainties
on arms talks.
   The Soviets are vague on issues that Bush wants closer to
settlement by the May 30 summit. Even getting approval for a
final summit schedule is hard. One worry: Gorbachev may be
unwilling to compromise until after his party congress July
2. "We're not sure what's going on over there," says a top
administration Soviet expert.
   Baker will try to break the logjam by carrying "new ideas"
to Moscow next week. These are expected to include
unspecified suggestions on sea-launched cruise missiles. The
U.S. wants these largely excluded from the treaty. The
Soviets have back-tracked and are pressing for tougher limits
on numbers and range.
   Baker came away from last week's meeting with Shevardnadze
frustrated at the Soviets' ambiguous positions.
                                                                                                       

   CANDID COMMENTS by Shevardnadze in a speech surprise U.S.
officials. He told his foreign ministry staff that the Soviet
Union isn't truly a great power because by "praying unduly
assiduously to the idols of pseudo-ideology, we made our
people, the whole country, destitute." He added that he and
other leaders are under attack.
                                                                                                       

   BUDGET BANTER: Senate Budget Chairman Sasser boasted that
the White House urged a budget summit after "they saw the
horse was about to get out of the barn before they got it
bridled." At the Kentucky Derby, he met Budget Chief Darman,
who needled: "Now I know where you get your metaphors." But
Sasser got the last laugh: He won $118 on a $10 bet on
Unbridled, the long-shot winner.
                                                                                                       

   THE "BUBBA VOTE" is courted by Texas Democrat Ann Richards
in her gubernatorial race against GOP oilman-rancher Clayton
("I am Bubba") Williams. She helps roast Port Arthur native
and Oklahoma basketball coach Billy Tubbs, will talk to
independent oil producers in Midland and attend the Cattle
Barons Ball in Tyler.
                                                                                                       

   TAKEN FOR GRANITE? Quayle roils the waters in New
Hampshire's GOP Senate primary by vowing to attend a
fund-raiser May 22 for Rep. Robert Smith. If Smith wins the
Senate seat, he would probably be the state's senior
Republican during the 1996 presidential primary and a key
ally if Quayle seeks the presidency then.
                                                                                                       

   DIVISIVE ISSUES slow the flow of Supreme Court decisions.
   Though the justices have heard the fewest argued cases in
20 years, they still have more than 60 rulings before the
term ends in June. The deliberate pace suggests disagreements
that are delaying decisions. Topping the list: two cases
involving parental notification for minors' abortions; both
sides of the abortion debate are already gearing up
responses.
   The court also is expected to rule on the "right-to-die"
issue of whether a state may require that persons in comatose
conditions be kept alive. Another case involves a federal law
that requires equal access in public schools for religious
clubs. And a ruling is likely on the issue of affirmative
action in awarding federal broadcast licenses.
   Another hot item: A possible reprise of last June's 5-to-4
decision that flagburning is a protected form of protest.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Mixing mom and politics, the conservative
Family Research Council declares that "Mother's Day is not
Child Care Provider's Day." . . . Unlikely fan club: The
Soviet Literary Gazette praises Bush's Chief of Staff Sununu
as "a remarkable phenomenon in American political life . . .
a brilliant organizer . . . emphatically in agreement with
the pragmatic president." . . . Mocking his King Richard
nickname, SEC Chairman Breeden explains his lateness for a
speech saying he had "trouble parking the carriage and
horses."
