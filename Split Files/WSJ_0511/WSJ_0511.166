   British Telecommunications PLC, London, said it plans to
eliminate 4,000 to 5,000 middle-management jobs as part of a
previously announced corporate reorganization to cut costs.
   The job cuts in a workforce of about 244,000 are the first
in what Britain's main telephone company says will be a
steady shedding of jobs over the next few years as fewer
workers are needed because of technological improvements.

   Also as part of the reorganization, the company named Mike
Bett, 55-year-old managing director of its main U.K.
subsidiary, to the newly created post of vice chairman
effective Oct. 1.
   Deep job cuts and public boardroom shuffles are relatively
new experiences for British Telecom, a former state telephone
monopoly privatized in 1984. In the past few years, pressure
for job cuts has been growing inside the company despite
stiff union opposition.
