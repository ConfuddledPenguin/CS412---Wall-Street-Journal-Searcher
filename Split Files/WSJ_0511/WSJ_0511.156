   Washington Post Co.'s board cleared the company to buy on
the open market as many as one million shares of its Class B
common stock, currently trading at $241.50 each.
   The board didn't set a price ceiling or a time limit for
the purchases. In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading
yesterday, the stock closed up $8.50 a share. At current
levels the transaction would cost the company as much as
$241.5 million.

   A spokesman said that since 1987 the company has purchased
about 700,000 of its shares on the open market.
   Peter Keefe, an analyst with Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co., noted
the buy-back strategy is common among companies in which
Warren E. Buffett is a major investor. Mr. Buffett, chairman
of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., controls 16.5% of Washington
Post's Class B stock, which are nonvoting shares. Class A
shares are 100% controlled by the family of Katharine Graham,
Washington Post chairman.
   The media company publishes the Washington Post newspaper
and Newsweek magazine.
