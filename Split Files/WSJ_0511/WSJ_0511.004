   LONDON -- The Bank of England forecasts that faster
growth, higher inflation and sustained high interest rates
can be expected in the world's major economies over the next
year.
   In its quarterly bulletin, the bank warns that although
"moderation" has so far prevailed in labor market pressures
in North America, Japan and Europe, "the risk nevertheless
remains that unduly buoyant demand could, in due course,
overstretch supply and push up labor and goods prices
everywhere."

   The bank said that following the swift move toward German
reunification, along with signs of further acceleration in
other economies, it has increased its forecast to 3 1/2%
average growth in the major economies this year. That's half
a percentage point higher than the forecast given its
previous bulletin in February.
