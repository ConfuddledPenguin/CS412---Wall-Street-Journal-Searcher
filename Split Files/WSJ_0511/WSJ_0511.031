   HONG KONG -- News Corp. said it may sell part of its Hong
Kong newspaper business to the public, in a step that
apparently is in keeping with the Australian media concern's
retrenchment.
   The plan, disclosed in a brief statement, involves the
South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's largest
English-language daily, owned by News Corp. Outside estimates
of the newspaper's value range from four billion to five
billion Hong Kong dollars (US$513 million to US$642 million).

   The statement said the plan tentatively "would be effected
by an offer for sale of a proportion of issued capital" of a
company holding News Corp.'s Hong Kong newspaper interests:
the Post and the Sunday Morning Post. It gave no further
details.
   Once listed on the local stock exchange, the Post was
taken private after being acquired in 1986 as part of News
Corp.'s global acquisition binge, which left it with more
than US$6 billion in debt.
   The plan appears to be part of a change in direction by
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian concern's chief executive
officer. In an April interview, Mr. Murdoch said News Corp.
would forgo further major acquisitions for the next two to
three years, work to prop up its sagging earnings, and focus
on its entertainment and media businesses. He denied that he
was under pressure to make major asset sales but did say he
might sell some properties on a selective basis.
   "The fact that {News Corp.} is highly geared in an
environment of rising interest rates requires a fairly tricky
balancing act," said John Mulcahy, research director of
Peregrine Brokerage Ltd., a local securities firm. The plan
would suggest that Mr. Murdoch "wishes to reduce his debt,"
added Mr. Mulcahy, formerly editor of the Post's business
section.
   Phillip Crawley, editor of the Post, declined to respond
to that assessment. Given Mr. Murdoch's high international
profile, Mr. Crawley said, "inevitably people will want to
speculate on why he wants to do this."
   Mr. Crawley focused instead on the public-relations aspect
of the proposal, which he said is aimed at least in part at
diluting local perceptions of the Post as being an
Australian-run publication. To underscore "our local
identity," Mr. Crawley explained, "we feel it would be good
to be a locally listed company again and give people a chance
to share in our success."
   He added that the plan could take place "in weeks" if the
necessary regulatory hurdles are cleared quickly.
   Since being acquired by Mr. Murdoch in late 1986 for about
US$300 million, the newspaper has grown steadily in
circulation and profitability. Its daily circulation stands
at about 103,000 during the week and 85,000 on Sundays.
Outside estimates place the newspaper's earnings last year at
about HK$400 million.
   In accordance with the local stock market's current
performance, new issues are being priced at about 10 times
earnings. That ratio would value the newspaper at HK$4
billion, more than 70% above Mr. Murdoch's acquisition cost.
   A report Thursday in the Hong Kong Economic Journal, a
local Chinese-language newspaper, said News Corp. may sell as
much as 45% of the Post through a combination of a public
offering and a private placement. The report said the plan
may involve the sale of existing stock as well as new shares.
Mr. Crawley declined comment on the report.
