   Nordstrom Inc., hurt by slower-than-anticipated sales and
higher expenses, said profit in the fiscal first quarter
plunged almost 43%.
   The Seattle retailer, which recently reported its first
annual profit decline since going public in 1971, said net
income in the period ended April 30 fell to $13.2 million, or
16 cents a share, from $23 million, or 28 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose 8.4% to $555 million from $512.2
million. But analysts said sales at stores open at least a
year inched up only 1.5% in the period -- and actually fell
in April.

   The results, which were worse than Wall Street expected,
were released after the stock market closed.
   Nordstrom attributed its sluggish sales partly to
difficulties it encountered in maintaining appropriate
inventory levels. Earnings fell, the company said, because it
reduced its merchandise markup in an attempt to make its
prices more competitive. Expenses also rose for other
reasons, some of which Nordstrom said were related to its
contract dispute with a union representing clerks and other
employees at Nordstrom's Seattle-area stores.
