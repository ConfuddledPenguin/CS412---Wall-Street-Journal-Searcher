   NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. -- Arco Chemical Co. is attempting to
develop a number of new products including a superabsorbent
fiber and a low-calorie fat substitute as part of a plan to
double the size of its business over the next five years.
   Harold A. Sorgenti, president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview the superabsorbent material, called
Fibersorb, has potential application in adult diapers and
surgery table matting, among many other uses. The
nondigestible fat substitute, which was patented recently, is
derived from one of the company's mainstay products,
propylene oxide.

   Known as EPG, the fat substitute probably will require
several more years of testing to satisfy requirements of the
Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, Mr. Sorgenti said
Arco Chemical is "trying to establish agreements" with a
number of other companies that could lead to EPG's
commercialization and marketing in food products.
   Arco Chemical scientists believe EPG has greater stability
than some other fat substitutes, such as Monsanto Co.'s
Simplesse, which recently won FDA approval for use in such
products as ice cream. "Ours has potential for hot-food
uses," Mr. Sorgenti said. "It can be baked, for instance."
   Arco Chemical's mainstay, propylene oxide, is an
intermediate used in making resins, urethanes, insulation
materials, cushionings and many health and food products.
Among its major derivatives are styrene, used widely in the
rubber and plastics industries; propylene glycol, used in
automotive coolants and aircraft de-icing products; and
tertiary butyl alcohol, used for octane enhancers that
replace lead in gasoline.
   The company's growth strategy is predicated largely on
expanding demand for these derivatives and finding new uses
for them. At the annual meeting of shareholders Wednesday,
Mr. Sorgenti announced plans to invest about $2.5 billion
over the next five years to support that expansion effort.
   More than half of the amount is expected to be spent in
areas outside the U.S. In 1989, foreign sales and exports
contributed 44% of the company's total sales of $2.66
billion. The company has customers in 46 countries.
   The largest family of propylene oxide derivatives is
polyols, which are used in urethane foams and coatings. New
plants in Indonesia and France will boost capacity by about
275 million pounds annually. In addition, the company has
agreed to buy Union Carbide Corp.'s urethane polyols and
propylene glycol businesses.
   As another part of the expansion plan, the company's
production capacity for propylene oxide will increase about
33% to four billion pounds by 1994, Mr. Sorgenti said, aided
by new plants in Texas and Korea.
   Even though the company has strong cash flow, financing
the expansion will require substantial increases in
borrowing. Arco Chemical has about $419 million of long-term
debt, representing about 19% of total capitalization.
   "We think our current capital structure is not optimal,"
said Marvin O. Schlanger, senior vice president and chief
financial officer. "We would like to have debt in the range
of 30% to 40%" of total capital, he said. The company plans
to reach that target gradually over several years.
   Profit margins on the company's styrene monomers, another
core product group, fell sharply in 1989 as world-wide
capacity increased and demand declined. One major factor, Mr.
Sorgenti said, was the steep drop in styrene demand in China
after the brutal political and economic crackdown last
spring. In addition, the automotive, housing and
durable-goods sectors of the U.S. economy softened, and they
are likely to remain sluggish through at least the first half
of 1990.
   "My own personal view is that we have bottomed out and are
coming back up," Mr. Sorgenti said. But he indicated that he
doesn't anticipate any dramatic increases in demand later
this year.
   In 1987, Atlantic Richfield Co. spun off part of Arco
Chemical in a public offering. The giant energy company still
owns more than 80% of the chemical maker's stock. Lodwrick M.
Cook, Atlantic Richfield's chairman and chief executive, is
also Arco Chemical's chairman.
   Mr. Cook missed the chemical maker's annual meeting
Wednesday because he was in Budapest, meeting with several
Hungarian companies that Mr. Sorgenti said "could have
potential for joint ventures" with Arco Chemical. He didn't
identify the companies or disclose the nature of the
prospective ventures.
   Mr. Sorgenti said he thinks his company is "poised to
benefit" from the relaxation of economic controls in Eastern
European, although "we believe it will take some time before
these markets are revitalized and demand increases for
chemical industry products."
