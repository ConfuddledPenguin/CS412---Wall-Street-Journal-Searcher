   NEW YORK -- The navigator is ready to embark, his vessel a
shopping cart. Peril is everywhere. To port lie reefs of
cholesterol; to starboard, shoals of saturated fat; ahead and
behind, outcrops of sodium. And all around he hears, luring
him toward shipwreck, the siren song of advertisers' claims.
   His mission: get through all this and emerge from
Waldbaum's all-night supermarket, here in Queens, with a load
of groceries that won't foul up his heart.

   This proves almost as tough a sail as Odysseus had in
getting home from Troy. But Odysseus had no charts. Our
navigator does -- a sheaf of reports and studies from
scientists who have spent many years ferreting out the links
between fats in the diet, cholesterol in the blood, and
coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis, the clogging of
the coronary arteries by fatty deposits that leads to heart
attacks.
   Plunging down aisle No. 1, the navigator immediately spots
a major hazard and briskly steers around it. Eggs. This is an
easy passage. By now most people know that egg yolks are
loaded with cholesterol and that too much cholesterol is bad.
But how much is too much, and for whom?
   Actually, cholesterol is necessary for life, and everybody
has a base level of it, manufactured by the liver, in his
bloodstream. This level is genetically determined, and there
isn't much that can be done to change it. On top of that,
however, everybody who eats animal products (plants have no
cholesterol) has an extra amount of it in the blood
attributable to that diet. This cholesterol can be lowered by
eating properly.
   About 10% of the people don't have to worry much. They
have a genetically set base level of cholesterol so low, or
their processing is so efficient, that they can eat pretty
much anything they want without clogging up their arteries.
Another 10% are unlucky. They have such high inborn levels
that they probably will develop coronary-artery disease no
matter how they restrict their diets.
   The rest of the population may be warier about eggs than
it once was, but people still consume far too much dietary
cholesterol -- an average of 450 milligrams a day, according
to research by the American Heart Association and the
American Dietetic Association. None of it is needed.
   "It is useful to remember that there is no known
biochemical reason for humans to ingest cholesterol at all,"
writes W. Virgil Brown, professor of medicine at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York. Vegetarians, he notes, eat
less than 10 milligrams of cholesterol a day and remain
healthy.
   Failing to discern any mass movement toward vegetarianism,
the heart association recommends a daily intake of no more
than 300 milligrams a day for most people. For those who want
to be absolutely heart-healthy or who are at or near high
blood cholesterol levels, 100 milligrams daily is the ration.
   That's 700 a week. The navigator consults his charts. They
say that one single, solitary egg yolk has 274 milligrams of
cholesterol. Sure, he can have an omelet -- if he is willing
to eat nothing else but plants all week. He is not willing.
Eggless, he sails on.
   Stopping near another part of Dairy Reef, he employs a
rule of thumb for such food: If it's solid at room
temperature, it's loaded with saturated fat and therefore
undesirable. More about fat later. It's enough to say now
that saturated fat is the worst kind for the innards and that
Americans eat way too much fat of all kinds -- representing
an average of 36% of the calories they consume.
   The heart association would like that cut to 30% or below.
Way below, others insist; the Pritikin diet, one of the most
severe, limits fat to 10% of calories. To our 59-year-old
shopper, whose belt has unaccountably been let out by two
notches over the past few years, all this means steering away
from butter, the "hard" margarines, and almost all cheeses.
   He reads the fine print. Dorman's LoCal Swiss cheese looks
good (the label says "80% less cholesterol" without saying
what it is 80% less than), but it still has some cholesterol
plus seven grams of fat. This is not high, but the navigator
knows that each thin slice will eat into the safety margin
he'll need in traversing the meat counter. He gets low-fat
cottage cheese instead, along with a quart of skim milk and a
"soft" margarine that has only one gram of saturated fat per
spoonful.
   He turns into aisle No. 2 -- and into a blinding fog of
health hype. Here is a sector that's eight cart-lengths long
and seven shelves high, crammed with hundreds of bottles of
salad dressing and cooking oils singing their own praises at
the expense of others -- "94% saturated fat free," "lower in
saturated fat than Mazola, Wesson or Crisco," "lowest in
saturated fat," and on and on.
   The navigator stops at Mazola, which recently had an ad in
American Health magazine. In the ad, a middle-aged jogger in
a sweatsuit is saying, "Great news] Mazola has now been
tested and approved by the American Heart Association Heart
Guide program. Even better news] A diet with Mazola brought
down my cholesterol."
   At first blush, impressive. But, for one thing, the heart
association, under pressure from the federal government, has
scrapped the Heart Guide program. (Even before that, Mazola
had pulled out of the program.) And inspection of the
evidence shows that the "even better news" is 17 years old
and that a lot more than the use of Mazola was behind the
lowering of cholesterol.
   The ad is based on an experiment in the early '70s by
physiologist Ancel Keys of the University of Minnesota, a
pioneer in linking diet to blood cholesterol and heart
disease. He put three dozen male college students on various
diets and measured the change in their cholesterol. A dozen
of them lowered it by an average of 17% over three weeks on
one 3,000-calorie diet (more than a non-athletic middle-aged
male should eat). That diet replaced butter and shortening
with corn oil like Mazola -- but it also involved substitutes
for meat, eggs and whole milk, changes that appear to have
been considerably more important.
   The lesson for the navigator? "Caveat emptor." And read
the fine print.
   He passes up aisle 2 for the moment and moves into the
calmer waters of the produce department. Here he can load up
unworried by fat, cholesterol or sodium. Amid the fuss and
feathers over the first two, sodium sometimes gets forgotten,
but it is an important contributor to hypertension and
congestive heart failure. Sodium encourages the retention of
water and thus increases blood volume and pressure. High
pressure can cause arterial blowouts -- stroke and aneurysm
-- and an aging, weakened heart can fail when required to
pump too high a volume of blood.
   Traversing the aisles, the shopper contents himself with
picking out products that claim they are lower in sodium than
competing brands and reading the labels to make sure they
are. (Meanwhile, the most effective measure to limit sodium
consumption has been taken back in his kitchen, where some of
the holes in the salt shaker have been taped over.)
   Going on, he almost grounds his vessel on a shoal of
Redi-Wip non-dairy dessert topping. "Contains no milk or milk
fat," the label says seductively. But the lookout spies in
the fine print the revelation that "partially hydrogenated
palm kernel oil" is the second most plentiful ingredient.
Which calls for a return to the arcane world of fats.
   There are three chemically different kinds of fats in
food. In saturated fats, hydrogen atoms are bound to all the
carbon atoms in the molecule; it is saturated with hydrogen.
In polyunsaturated fat, two or more pairs of carbon atoms
lack attached hydrogen. In monounsaturated fats, one pair
lacks it.
   Scientists don't understand the mechanism involved, but
they do know that replacing saturated fats in the diet with
polyunsaturated reduces blood cholesterol, and with it
coronary risk. The Redi-Wip? Its label fails to note that
palm kernel oil is 82% saturated fat in its natural state.
"Partial hydrogenation" makes it even more so. Feeling his
arteries constrict, the navigator goes on to meat and
seafood.
   He avoids cuts of meat heavily marbled or streaked with
solid fat, knowing that this very solidity means it is heavy
in the saturated variety. Most animal fats are 45% saturated.
A notable and healthy exception is fish; if fish carried such
a load of saturated fat, they'd become stiff as boards in
cold water and couldn't swim. So the navigator regretfully
sweeps past the spareribs, a favorite, and picks up instead
some whitefish chubs for Sunday breakfast.
   He needs his charts for other choices, for there are no
labels and appearances deceive. Liver and shellfish, for
example, look lean and heart-healthy, but a heavy dose of
cholesterol lurks hidden in their tissues. A lean sirloin is
better, but it still has 76 milligrams of cholesterol built
into every three-ounce serving.
   This doesn't mean sirloin, or foods like it, should be
shunned. In shopping for a healthy heart, neither basic
nutrition nor appetite appeal should be pitched overboard
just to shave off a few calories of fat or a few score
milligrams of cholesterol. What any shopper needs to do is
make sensible trade-offs and watch portion sizes.
   The navigator again consults the work of Dr. Brown of
Mount Sinai medical center. The doctor smiles on the
ingestion of three or four portions of meat, fish and/or
poultry daily, so long as the ingester is "a large person"
and isn't piggish. "It is advisable to keep the portion size
at four ounces for chicken and other poultry as well as for
meat," he writes magisterially. "This will be reduced to
approximately three ounces by broiling, providing a serving
approximately the size of a deck of playing cards."
   The navigator, whose usual portion runs more to the size
of a Robert Ludlum paperback, takes heed. A chicken and some
lean round steak are taken on board.
   Feeling righteous, he tacks over to baked goods and snack
foods, hoping to spend in tasty fashion some of the reserve
he has amassed by being so sensible about everything else. He
blows 89 grams of fat on Kellogg's Common Sense oat-bran
waffles, justifying the purchase thus: He likes waffles,
there are no egg yolks in these waffles, and the oat bran is
supposed to help ream out the arteries (there is now
considerable doubt that it does, to the consternation of an
industry that has filled the shelves with every conceivable
oat-bran product short of toilet paper).
   Other products look fairly benign and affordable under his
fat allowance, but the navigator discovers illusion here.
Frookie Seven-Grain Oatmeal Cookies ("no cholesterol, low in
saturated fat") have only 45 calories -- per cookie. Doritos
Nacho Cheese tortilla chips ("as always cholesterol free")
have a fairly modest seven grams of fat -- for every 15
chips. Who ever stopped at one cookie or 15 chips? No thanks.
   Almost finished with his circumnavigation of the store,
the shopper returns to the perils of aisle 2 and its 60 feet
of vegetable oils clamoring for his attention. Most of them
say they are "cholesterol free," which, as vegetable
products, they always were anyway. The issue here is not
cholesterol or calories -- almost all the oils have 120
calories per tablespoonful -- but the type of fat they
contain.
   So the label on Hollywood safflower oil ("lower in
saturated fat than Mazola, Wesson and Crisco") catches the
eye. It has 11 grams of polyunsaturated fat -- the better
kind -- and only one gram of saturated fat. Not bad. Crisco
soybean oil and Mazola corn oil have eight grams of
polyunsaturated fat but two grams of the saturated kind.
   But what about Puritan canola oil, which brags that it's
94% saturated fat free, with four grams of polyunsaturated
fat and one gram of saturated fat? And Vineyard grapeseed
oil, with the same composition? Are they better or worse than
safflower oil?
   All these vegetable oils have 14 grams of total fat per
tablespoon, but in every case the amounts given for saturated
and polyunsaturated fats don't add up to 14 grams. What is
the missing fat? It has to be monounsaturated, which brings
us to the sunny shores of the Mediterranean.
   Advocates of heart-healthy nutrition have long pushed for
replacing saturated fats in the diet with polyunsaturated
ones. But some studies indicate that although the latter
lower total cholesterol, large amounts of them may increase
the risk of gallstones and reduce so-called HDL, the "good"
form of cholesterol that actually protects against heart
disease.
   The Greeks and the Italians may have an answer. Their diet
is heavy in fat -- up to 40% of calories -- but they rarely
have coronary disease. The fat they eat is mainly
monounsaturated. So Bertolli's olive oil, with 11 grams of
monounsaturated fat, goes into the basket.
   The navigator is at last ready for checkout. Only one
nagging question bothers him. Will biscuits made with olive
oil taste as good as biscuits made with old-fashioned,
bad-for-you Crisco shortening? He'll soon find out.
