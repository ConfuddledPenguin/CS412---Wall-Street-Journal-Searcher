   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- After 58 years of sloth and
indulgence, after a few thousand eat-in office lunches of
pizza and stress, after countless couch-potato hours spent
watching other people perspire on television, my time finally
has come. Goodbye to all that. I am going to be one of the
Healthy California People everybody reads about in the new
magazines.
   If my time has come, it is high time. Evil things have
happened to my body. I am overweight. My cholesterol count --
people on the coast talk about their cholesterol as much as
they talk about real-estate prices -- is too high. I am
taking a mild diuretic because my blood pressure is also a
little elevated, and at the end of most days I feel as though
people have been beating me with baseball bats. (Sometimes
they have, figuratively speaking, but that's another story.)

   So I have been dispatched here to the Pritikin Longevity
Center, by a beach lined with waving palms, to see what can
be done about my carcass and my life style. After the usual
welcoming ceremonials, including the handing over of a large
check, I trudge to my room. There is no bathtub. I like
bathtubs, and for $2,379 a week -- plus $850 for medical fees
-- I had figured on maybe having one.
   It strikes me that this is only the first of many things I
will be deprived of by the Pritikin people, and I begin to
feel like a misbehaving first-grader ordered to sit outside
the principal's office, awaiting a discipline that inflates
in the imagination with every passing minute. Starvation,
exhaustion and badgering will be my lot, I'm sure. After all,
isn't this the Parris Island of the fitness movement?
   If it is, or was, the late Nathan Pritikin -- he committed
suicide five years ago, at age 69, after a long struggle with
lymphoma -- was a drill sergeant. In 1958 doctors told him
his arteries were clogged. Don't exert yourself, they said,
and you just might hang on for quite a while. He thumbed his
nose at them.
   After immersion in studies of nutrition and exercise, he
devised for himself a strenuous program of running and a diet
that was extremely limited in proteins (10% to 15% of
calories) and fats (no more than 10%), and very high in
carbohydrates (75% to 80%), particularly the complex
carbohydrates found in starchy vegetables and whole grains.
It worked for him and others, and the Pritikin program hit
the market.
   It was as tough as he was, requiring a near-fanatical
adherence to the founder's rules. Many foods were banned, and
few restaurants served meals that came close to meeting his
standards. This sometimes left traveling disciples sitting in
their hotel rooms, joylessly masticating bulgar wheat dredged
out of their suitcases, while their peers pigged out on
cholesterol-laden expense-account dinners.
   So I am apprehensive as I go to my first meal at the
center, a brunch. A lover of Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
grilled burgers dripping fat, I know I will get neither here.
The question is what I will get. The answer, at least for the
first day's menu, is a melange of allegedly Mexican food --
never one of my favorites -- some of it employing yolkless
eggs and other distinctly non-Mexican substances.
   I eat it anyway. It's not bad. In fact, it's very good. It
didn't used to be, says fellow guest Burt Braverman, who has
been coming to this center for 12 years (there is another in
Miami). When he first came, he recalls, "I couldn't eat the
food. Nobody knew how to cook the low-fat way then." Nathan
Pritikin, he adds, "even preferred it tasteless."
   Monday is doctor day. I am ripped out of bed at 6:15,
tapped of body fluids, questioned, poked, prodded and worked
out to see at what point I give up. There's good news and bad
news.
   The bad news is that at 6 feet 3 inches, I weigh 228 when
I should weigh 209, my triglycerides -- fatty acids in the
blood -- are above normal, and my cholesterol count of 228 is
way above the 160 the Pritikin people (who are very severe on
this point) shoot for as an upper limit. Also, I am, in
effect, a walking cheeseburger; body fat accounts for 36.4%
of my weight, more than double the desirable percentage.
   The good news is that this walking cheeseburger slam-dunks
the cardiac stress test. Wired to a treadmill and an
electrocardiograph, I go faster and faster at a steepening
incline. "Don't be an idiot]" I tell myself. "The faster you
go now, the faster they'll make you exercise later." But
another voice whispers, "Don't let them beat you," and I push
to my limit.
   I recover quickly, show no abnormalities in heart function
and have performed at 14 METs (metabolic equivalents, a
measure of the body's processing of oxygen). Most people my
age can hit only 7 to 10 METs; trained athletes perform at 18
and above. Feeling a little chesty, I get an exercise
prescription tailored to my needs and swagger off -- to a
treadmill class.
   By this time our group of 90 guests -- some here for a
week, others for 13 days or 26 days -- has suffered a
defection of sorts. Sophie Vavilitis, a New Yorker who came
to be with friends, has inspected the menu and schedule and
found them wanting. She has checked into a nearby hotel,
where she is relishing steak, lamb chops, and buttered
croissants, all forbidden here. No early-morning stretching
exercises for her. "Not my style,"she says.
   By contrast, we who remain will get no fatty foods and
only 3 1/2 ounces of high protein (turkey and fish, no red
meat) all week. This would seem to be dietary masochism of a
high order, but I find it increasingly easy to live by. Meals
are very tasty, fruit and vegetable snacks are abundant and,
except for the high proteins, which are measured out, nobody
stands at my shoulder to limit what I eat.
   Clearly, the center has abandoned the rigidity and
all-or-nothing certitude that marked it when Nathan Pritikin
ran the place, possibly because too many would-be clients
found it too intimidating. Instead of banning whole
categories of food and commanding the ingestion of others,
the Pritikin Lifetime Eating Plan (which we are all supposed
to follow when we leave) now only defines foods with the
labels "go," "caution" and "stop."
   We get only the "go" foods while here, but are allowed
more latitude at home; the measly 3 1/2 ounces of protein,
for example, would be our daily ration there, not our weekly
one, and can include some lean red meat.
   The training schedule begins to settle into a routine by
Tuesday. It begins at 6:35 a.m. with wake-up and stretching
exercises, where I meet Angus Miller, who has a lot to
stretch.
   A 375-pound shop foreman from Calgary, he is chasing a
carrot on a stick held by his boss. The latter has promised
to reimburse him for the cost of 26 days here -- $9,000 plus
air fare -- but only at the rate of $1,000 for every 10
pounds Mr. Miller can lose, here and afterward. (He nicks the
boss for a third of the bill by the time he leaves, and is
delighted that he can touch his toes.)
   The days become a blur of classes -- nutrition, cooking,
"life style," relaxation techniques (my favorite, in which a
good part of the class falls asleep) -- interspersed with
exercise: treadmill and aerobics, both done to a driving
musical beat, individual sessions in the gym, more
stretching, weights, the stationary bicyle, a walk along the
beach. And all the vegetables and fruit you can eat.
   Sweating at the treadmill, Leeds Katzen, a 53-year-old
cataract surgeon from Baltimore, says "fear of dying" propels
him. His father died of coronary disease, so he has been
attending Pritikin sessions for the past six years for the
medical examinations and the reinforcement that the training
gives him.
   About half the people here are repeaters. "It's a
brainwash, but it only lasts so long," says Caroline Aktar,
who has come here all the way from Istanbul for the third
year in a row with her husband, Samih, who is 50. Though he
had a triple bypass in 1986 and his cholesterol remains
worrisome, diet and exercise soon are forgotten when he
returns to Turkey, she complains.
   Even here it is hard not to stray. The fleshpots of Santa
Monica beckon, and, fearful of our weaknesses, most of us
stay in at night. There are taped movies, even live
entertainment; outside, there is the smell of coffee,
cigarettes, and the indescribable aroma wafting from the
golden arches of McDonald's.
   If we resist them, we have our reasons. The primary one:
There is evidence that adherence to a Pritikin-type diet and
exercise program can actually reverse coronary-artery
disease.
   One of the guests, Robert Sherman Jr., was told in 1978
that he needed bypass surgery because some of his coronary
arteries were 70% to 90% closed. He came to the center
instead. Once on the program, he recalls, "I knew within two
weeks I was better. I felt alive." He never had the surgery.
Now, at the age of 74, he has come back here with his
41-year-old son, Robert.
   When I check out of the center, I have some idea of what
he means. I have no miracles to show for my week here. My
blood pressure is only marginally improved, to 140/80 from
140/90, and I continue on my diuretic. I have lost only seven
pounds, though I certainly wasn't starving myself. My
cholesterol count, at 219, hasn't improved sharply from 228
going in.
   But my triglycerides have plummeted to a normal 114 from
an over-the-top 163, I have whacked a full two inches off an
expanding gut, and I feel better and more energetic than I
have in years. Returning to a world full of pizza and stress,
I can't guarantee that I can continue to follow the Pritikin
Way for the rest of my life. But I want to. And so far, with
only moderate cheating, I have.
