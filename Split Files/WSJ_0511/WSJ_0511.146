   U S West Inc., Denver, said its Cable London joint venture
with Comcast Corp. was awarded a franchise to provide
cable-television and telephone services to two boroughs of
London.
   Construction of the $75 million system, to serve Islington
and Hackney boroughs, is expected to begin in the fall.
Service is supposed to be available by the end of this year.
The franchise will serve about 152,000 homes and 12,000
businesses, U S West said.

   Industry officials predicted that the move will expand
business opportunities in the North London market, helping to
justify the expense of developing locally generated
television programming.
   U S West, a diversified telecommunications concern, has
won eight other cable franchises in the U.K. And the company
is developing a cable venture in Hong Kong.
Philadelphia-based Comcast, one of the largest cable
operators in the U.S., also has interests in cellular
communications.
