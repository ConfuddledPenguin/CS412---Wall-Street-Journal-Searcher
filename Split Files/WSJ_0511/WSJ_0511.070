   Regarding Tim W. Ferguson's April 10 Business World
column, "AMA Sounding a Clear Note, but Its Tune Has
Changed," about the new acting top AMA executive, Dr. James
Todd:
   During its 1964-65 campaign against Medicare, the "old"
AMA predicted that certain consequences would result from
federal involvement in medicine: excess demand, soaring
prices, deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship to
the middle and upper classes. Although proponents of Medicare
ridiculed these predictions at the time, ensuing events have
proved that all of them were accurate.

   But the old AMA did not predict the moral corruption among
physicians themselves -- the breaking of a class of
independent people to the bureaucratic yoke. Yet, in large
part that too must be counted as an "accomplishment" of
federal medicine.
   A class of people under bureaucratic control often
produces more overseers than leaders. When the officers of
the new AMA propose to cure evils wrought by government with
yet more government, they must speak primarily for those
physicians who have lost the self-respect to which their
profession entitles them. It would be better if the AMA would
speak the truth most others are avoiding -- that the federal
entry into medicine (quite apart from its dubious
constitutionality) has been a fiscal and policy disaster.
Federal involvement in medicine does not need to be expanded,
it needs to be reversed.

   Mr. Ferguson's description of Dr. Todd reveals a man who
has failed to learn the lessons of the results of decades of
the British National Health Service, the Canadian National
Health Service and other forms of government-allocated care.
   According to the College of Health's latest Guide to
Hospital Waiting Lists, in the U.K. there are more than a
million people waiting to be admitted to a hospital, and more
than a quarter of them have been waiting more than a year.
Similar problems are plaguing the Canadian system. Treatments
requiring advanced medical technologies are generally more
difficult to obtain in these nationalized medical programs,
especially if you are elderly. For example, CAT scanners are
available at a far smaller percentage of Canadian hospitals
than U.S. hospitals of a comparable size. Often, individuals
requiring a CAT scan (generally used in the diagnosis of
serious conditions) have to be placed on a waiting list.
   It is no coincidence that, in Soviet-bloc countries,
people have to wait on long lines to get health care, housing
and automobiles, as well as food, and that in Western nations
people have to wait on long lines to get "free" government
health care. In all these cases, the results are due to
centralized control of production and distribution. Why are
so many people eager to copy the failed economics of the
Soviet bloc in the area of health care?
