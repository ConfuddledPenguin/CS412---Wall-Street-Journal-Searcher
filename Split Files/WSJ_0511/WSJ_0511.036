   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on the
senior debt of Bank of New England Corp., Bank of Boston
Corp. and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group because of the
worsening New England economy, particularly its real estate
sector.
   S&amp;P said it lowered its ratings on $820 million of Bank of
Boston's debt. Among the issues affected were the
Boston-based company's senior debt, whose rating was lowered
to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus; subordinated debt,
downgraded to double-B-plus from triple-B; preferred stock,
lowered to double-B from triple-B-minus; and commercial
paper, reduced to A-3 from A-2.

   The Bank of Boston issues were removed from CreditWatch,
where they were placed April 30 with negative implications,
S&amp;P added.
   S&amp;P said Bank of Boston's first-quarter results "evidence
the company's slide in asset quality and continued deepening
of the New England regional real estate recession." S&amp;P added
that the company's loan-loss provisions haven't "kept pace
with problem loan identification, and it is likely that lower
profitability in future quarters will result."
   Peter J. Manning, Bank of Boston's chief financial
officer, said that the company is "obviously disappointed" at
the rating change, and that "we stand ready to deal with
uncertainties in the current economic environment."
   For the first quarter, Bank of Boston earned $43.6
million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $89.1 million, or
$1.23 a share, a year earlier.
   S&amp;P said it lowered its ratings on Bank of New England's
senior debt to triple-C from single-B-plus and on its
subordinated debt to double-C from single-B-minus. About $675
million of debt was affected by the rating changes, S&amp;P
added.
   S&amp;P said the Boston-based bank-holding company "has made
strides in coping with its difficult operating environment,
especially in stabilizing its immediate liquidity troubles,
but its viability is dependent on improvement in the regional
economy and continued regulatory forbearance." S&amp;P added that
"given a stringent regulatory environment and general
illiquidity of the parent company, it is likely that bank
holding company creditors will suffer losses."
   For the first quarter, Bank of New England reported a loss
of $46.6 million, or 68 cents a share, including a $124.8
million pretax gain from the sale of assets.
   In Boston, a Bank of New England spokesman said the S&amp;P
downgrade "is not unexpected." He added that the concern "is
current on all of its interest payments. Deposits have
stabilized, and the company is moving forward with its
recovery plan."
   S&amp;P said it lowered its ratings on Fleet/Norstar Financial
Group's senior debt to single-A-minus from single-A-plus,
subordinated debt to triple-B-plus from single-A, preferred
stock to triple-B from single-A-minus, and commercial paper
to A-2 from A-1.
   The issues were removed from CreditWatch, where they were
placed Monday with negative implications, S&amp;P said. About
$2.2 billion of debt was affected.
   S&amp;P said "the downgrades reflect Fleet/Norstar's poor
first-quarter results and substantial rise in nonperforming
assets, which confirm that the New England regional economic
troubles, especially in real estate, have not abated."
   In Providence, R.I., Jack Flynn, Fleet/Norstar's vice
president, finance, said, "We're pleased S&amp;P continues to
rank our {senior} debt in the A category."
   For the first quarter, Fleet/Norstar reported a loss of
$98.1 million, or 92 cents a share.
