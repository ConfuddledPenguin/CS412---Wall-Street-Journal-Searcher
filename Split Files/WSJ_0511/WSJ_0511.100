   I do not wish to sound too critical, but the headline (and
the last paragraph) of Herbert Stein's April 12
editorial-page article -- "As They Said in Tokyo, `Kutubare
GNP]'" -- attracted my attention.
   We never have said and never will say that in Tokyo. We
say "Kutabare GNP]" and it certainly means "To hell with
GNP." I suggest next time when you transcribe a foreign
language, at least please check with somebody who knows the
language.
