   International Business Machines Corp. is stepping up its
campaign to unseat Apple Computer Inc. in the classroom as
the leading supplier of personal computers to primary and
secondary schools.
   IBM fired the latest salvo in the struggle by unveiling a
new PC, the Model 25 286, aimed at teachers and
administrators. But industry executives said Apple, which has
seen its share of the education market tumble sharply in the
past four years, will strike back as early as next week by
slashing prices that schools pay for several models of its
Macintosh computer.

   Moreover, in a videocassette mailed this week to thousands
of educators across the country, Apple Chairman John Sculley
promised that an inexpensive, color Macintosh will debut
during the 1990-1991 school year, and that the long-rumored
computer will be able to run programs written for the
fast-fading Apple II machine.
   Education and computer experts said Apple's moves were
largely defensive, however, and credited IBM with seizing the
initiative in a market that has long been owned by Apple.
   The education market over which the two computer makers
are scrapping is estimated at about $750 million a year in
the U.S. Industry marketers said its importance far outstrips
its dollar value, because it imprints brand and
operating-system loyalties on the young that translate into
billions of dollars of future sales.
   Hence the intensity with which this marketing battle is
being fought. "Apple has fallen behind in some areas, and
people have become a little panicked," said Charlotte Arnold,
director of marketing and product dissemination for
Humanities Software Inc., a Hood River, Ore., publisher of
education software. "IBM has taken that ball and run with
it."
   Specifically, educators faulted Apple for failing to
provide an easy evolutionary path from the aging Apple II,
which is still the dominant computer in education, to the
Macintosh, which Apple has touted as its natural successor.
At present, the machines can't run each others' software. In
addition, educators said, even low-end Macintoshes remain too
expensive for many schools.
   "It was clear to everybody that they needed to get out of
the (Apple II) as soon as the (Macintosh) came along," said
Kerry Johnson, director of information services and
educational technology for the Sacramento City Unified School
District. "They should have graduated and moved on; instead,
they kept us in the old technology and marketed the hell out
of it," he added.
   IBM has stepped into this breach over the past two years,
educators said, releasing a slew of inexpensive products and
programs aimed at tempting Apple users to convert to IBM
Personal System/2 PCs.
   Besides earmarking a specific model, the Model 25, for the
education market, IBM has courted administrators and teachers
by offering discounts, seminars and software designed in
consultation with education experts. In addition, IBM has
played up its strong image in the corporate world, and made
use of its far-flung marketing and service abilities.
   "I am persuaded that, more than at any time in the past
several years, they are making a tremendous commitment in
this marketplace," said Robert Pearlman, national consultant
on educational technology for the American Federation of
Teachers. "They are taking it very, very seriously," he said.
   Indeed, IBM Chairman John Akers emphasized the company's
huge gains in education at the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant's
recent annual meeting in Phoenix. For the latest complete
academic year, 1988-1989, IBM's share of the primary and
secondary school market had risen to 30% from 5% in
1985-1986. In the same period, Apple's share fell from 70% to
54%.
   Then Mr. Akers made an audacious prediction. "When we
count it up at the end of this year," he said, "there's a
good chance that IBM will be the market-share leader for the
year in kindergarten through 12th grade. . . . We'd like to
have young people who have their first experience with a
computer, either at home or in school, to have it with an IBM
computer."
   Most market watchers said this scenario may be a little
too optimistic. Some said IBM's gains, while sharp, may prove
to be temporary, and that Mr. Akers will end up with egg on
his face.
   "The story for 1990-1991 is going to be a very strong
comeback for Apple," said Peter Kelman, publisher of
Scholastic Software, an educational software concern that is
a division of Scholastic Inc. "With the cheap color
(Macintosh), they are definitely going to regain leadership.
They've never lost the hearts and minds of the teachers."
   Mr. Kelman also said many publishers of educational
software have become disillusioned with IBM computers, even
as those computers gain ground in the schools. IBM machines
are perceived to be harder to use than Apple computers, and
schools tend to buy them as part of "Integrated Learning
Systems" -- highly structured packages of hardware and
software that guide students through a predetermined
curriculum.
   That doesn't leave much room for software developers to
come up with the same kind of innovative, easy-to-use
programs that are possible with the Macintosh, Mr. Kelman
said. And such programs have proved in the past to be a
crucial ingredient for success in the education market.
   In addition, Apple has cultivated an image as an
education-oriented company for years, and it has made a big
show of donating PCs to schools. Although IBM's efforts are
gaining it many converts in the schools, it has a lot of
catching up to do.
   The 1990-1991 school year may prove to be crucial in this
regard. While Apple's engineers struggle to come up with a
machine that can turn back IBM's gains, Mr. Sculley and other
executives must convince educators that they haven't been
forgotten, countering accusations that Apple is running after
big corporate clients by concentrating on high-priced
machines -- a move that Apple defends as necessary to fill
out its product line. IBM, meanwhile, has been focusing much
of its PC efforts on the low end, giving the impression it
cares about a market Apple is neglecting.
   In essence, Apple's message is: Trust us, and give us
another year. "Our product development efforts have shifted
toward the lower end of the Macintosh product line," Mr.
Sculley said on the videocassette sent to educators.
"Education is deep in the roots of Apple. It's where we
began; it's the most important long-term strategic objective
that we have for our company," he said.
   Bernard Gifford, Apple's vice president for education, is
blunter. Admitting that the company has been bleeding market
share for the past two years, he says it's because Apple has
failed to provide enough inexpensive Macintosh products. He
especially rues the lack of a low-end Mac with a color
screen, because color bolsters children's interest in
learning. Although the Apple IIgs has a color screen, it's
seen as yesterday's technology; IBM has provided low-end
color computers for years.
   "I'm truly sorry that we can't provide that product
today," Mr. Gifford said. "But we will have it in the next
school year, and frankly, we think it's going to be a
barn-burner. . . . The (yet-to-be-announced) pricing action
on the compact Macintosh, and the introduction of an
entry-level color Mac that will run Apple II software, will
not only arrest our decline on market share, it will also
reverse the trend," he said.
   But many education watchers think IBM has put a permanent
crimp in Apple's claims to market leadership. Some point to
the trend toward hooking computers together in schools: IBM's
computers are much easier than Apple's to connect to each
other. Others note that, having gained market share, IBM is
unlikely to relinquish it, and it may even be on enough of a
roll to fulfill Mr. Akers's expectations.
   Ann Wujcik, an analyst for Link Resources Inc., a market
researcher, thinks the decisive factor will be psychological.
"IBM has changed its image totally in the eyes of the school
community," she said. "There is now a serious belief that
they care as much or more than Apple."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
IBM rose $1.125 to close at $112.375. Apple fell 50 cents to
$41.375 in national over-the-counter trading.
