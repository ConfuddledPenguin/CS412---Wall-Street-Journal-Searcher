   Frankfort, Ky. -- I spent the week of the Fourth debunking
Daniel Boone. With due apologies to the grand old flag, noble
pioneers and apple pie, there's a good bit to debunk.
   Daniel Boone first came into the Kentucky wilderness on a
hunting expedition in 1769 when he was 35 years old. Then in
1775 he (and others) blazed the Wilderness Trail through
Cumberland Gap and established Boonesborough. By the
mid-1780s he held claim to several thousand acres, making him
one of the wealthiest men on the frontier. In the land frenzy
that came to Kentucky along with statehood in 1792 Boone lost
most of his land. He moved to Missouri in 1799 and died there
in 1820.

   For almost two centuries Kentuckians have been collecting
Booneabilia (some Boone, some bunkum) including even his
bones, which the state recovered from Missouri in 1845. Mike
Hudson of the Kentucky Historical Society has combed this
trove and organized "The Legend of Daniel Boone: The First
Frontier Hero," a collection of the best and the worst. But
not the bones, they lie buried (unauthenticated) a few blocks
from the Old Capitol where this exhibit will remain until
Nov. 1. The displays tell a lot about Daniel Boone but even
more about what Mr. Hudson calls, "the liberal use our
society has made of him."
   Daniel Boone's first PR man, John Filson (who owned, and
was willing to sell, some prime Kentucky acres), touted Boone
in his 1784 "The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of
Kentucke." This exhibit shows how writers, entertainers,
historians and collectors have expanded on various aspects of
Filson's Boone to mold a Hero.
   With a few adjustments Boone made a wonderful Noble
Savage. He stood about 5 feet, 8 or 10 inches, a decent-sized
man for his time, but he was expanded to fit the role. The
theme song from the television series wafts through the
displays, "Daniel Boone was a big man, a biiiiig man." John
James Audubon met him in the Kentucky woods and reported that
he "approached the gigantic." The exhibit is peppered with
book illustrations that show a towering Boone, muscles
bursting out of his buckskins.
   Boone brought other qualifications to the role of Noble
Savage: He spent months alone in the wilderness, not because
he craved communion with nature, but because hunting deer and
beaver was his chief livelihood, and also because in-depth
wandering equipped him to make knowledgeable land claims. He
kept moving his family away from settled territory, not for
elbow room, or to escape the wicked ways of civilization, but
because he wanted to own land. While his skills amazed
readers in Philadelphia and Boston, such expertise was common
knowledge west of the Alleghenies then, and did not
necessarily preclude some formal education. His spelling was
ghastly, but he could read and write; he signed "Daniel
Boone," while scores of his Kentucky contemporaries signed
"X."
   This is not a kid's show; there's too much reading for
that. But there are some fun things: kitsch including
Boone-logoed lunch boxes, dime novels and a bottle of Daniel
Booze. And there is a collection of pictures and bark
fragments from "D. Boon"-carved trees -- in the late 19th
century "D. Boon" was the Kentucky equivalent of Kilroy.
   Boone as Noble Savage inspired romantic paintings
including a hero-pose oil by William C. Allen that the
Kentucky Legislature bought in 1839 after turning down an
offering from Chester Harding. In the last years of his life,
Boone sat for Harding. That portrait of Boone as an old man,
in the show and reproduced here, is the only authentic
picture of Boone.
   The 1960s television show about Boone starring Fess Parker
presented him as a wise, teetotaling, diplomatic,
"civilized," Frontier Father, a coonskin-capped agent of
civilization. Mr. Hudson calls this retouched Boone the
Settler and includes countless pictures of Boonean coonskin
caps to illustrate the success of this early example of
image-making. By all reports Boone wore a wide-brimmed hat.
   All the same, Boone did qualify as a settler, but it was
not always in storybook style. Two of his children were
murdered by Indians. When hunting failed he worked
more-confining jobs to feed his family, as tavern keeper,
farmer, land agent and public official. He used his
understanding of Indians to mediate with them, sometimes with
little appreciation from either side. On one such occasion he
wrote, "I am hire With my hands full of Bisness and No
Athority and if I am not indulged in What I Do for the best
it Is Not worth my While to put my Self to all this trouble."
He did fight Indians, but not as a crusade. In his old age he
said he was only positive of killing one Indian, at the
Battle of Blue Licks, a needless but horribly bloody affair
that Boone got into against his better judgment and regretted
all his life.
   The authentic accouterments of wilderness settlement
included in this show are worn and soiled and in fragments,
common things from an uncommon age: a five-pointed star quilt
made by Boone's niece, a huge iron kettle from Blue Licks (it
took 840 gallons of water to yield a bushel of salt. Boone
was at the licks making salt in 1778 when he was captured by
Indians and marched to Detroit), bullets pried from a
Boonesborough fireplace.
   Boone spent his last years as a mostly unwilling
celebrity, telling tales and trying to set the record
straight. A Missouri traveler recalled a conversation with
him in which Boone said, "Many heroic exploits and chivalrous
adventures are related to me which only exist in the regions
of fancy. With me the world has taken great liberty, and yet
I have been but a common man."
   Touting common man appears to be a trend now in
historiography. Debunked as the All-American Hero, Boone will
fit nicely into the plain niche he said he deserved.
