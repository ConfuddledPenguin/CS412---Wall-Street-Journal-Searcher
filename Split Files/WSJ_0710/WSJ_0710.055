   Altos Computer Systems, San Jose, Calif., said that
Taiwan's Acer Group began its previously announced tender
offer for Altos's shares outstanding. Acer, a computer maker,
is offering $8.35 a share as part of a merger agreement that
Acer and Altos signed last Wednesday.
   The acquisition will be made by AAC Acquisition Corp., a
subsidiary of Acer's U.S. unit. The tender offer will expire
Aug. 3, the company said. Altos shares closed yesterday at
$8.125, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading.
