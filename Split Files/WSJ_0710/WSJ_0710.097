   ELKHART, Ind. -- CTS Corp. said it is investing more than
$16 million in a project to expand its plant near Glasgow,
Scotland, to boost sales of its electronic products to the
European market.
   The company said construction will start immediately on a
plant addition, which will create more than 250 additional
jobs by 1995. CTS said it will produce automotive throttle
position sensors, resistor networks, and precision and clock
oscillators, in addition to the electronic connectors,
backplanes and memory subsystems made now at the plant.
