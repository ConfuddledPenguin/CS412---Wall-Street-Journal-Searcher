   DALLAS -- The folks at Evergreen Property Capital Corp.
say they can solve the thorny problems facing some of
Southmark Corp.'s limited partnerships.
   There's just one catch: They are some of the same people
who helped create the problems.

   As former top executives of Southmark/Envicon Capital
Corp., John Galston and Eugene Rosen helped package and sell
interests in dozens of Southmark private limited partnerships
that raised nearly $400 million. The partnerships, which
invested in health-care properties and other real estate,
were sold to thousands of individual investors who could
afford to pony up $25,000 to $150,000 each.
   Now, many of the partnerships are in trouble, and Messrs.
Galston and Rosen have asked their former customers to trust
them once again. They want investors to join their Limited
Partner Investor Monitoring Committee and help wrest control
from Southmark of 33 partnerships into which investors sank
$130 million to $140 million.
   Sales of limited partnerships bolstered the rapid growth
of Southmark -- once a highflying real estate and thrift
concern -- and contributed to its equally quick demise.
   During much of the 1980s, Southmark bought real estate and
resold it to limited partners, often booking large profits.
Based partly on that apparent financial success, Southmark
was able to sell almost $1 billion in junk bonds with the
help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., becoming the nation's
largest publicly traded real-estate concern.
   But when tax-law changes stalled syndication sales and a
real-estate recession depressed asset values, Southmark's
cash flow disappeared. Short of funds, it sought
bankruptcy-law protection in July 1989. Meanwhile, its
continued cash bind and its need to cut staff left it
ill-prepared to aid its 335 public and private partnerships
or advise the 145,000 people who invested $2 billion in the
partnerships.
   Campaigning against Southmark, New York-based Evergreen
claims to have received enough proxies to replace Southmark
as general partner of 33 private partnerships that own mostly
health-care properties. Southmark responded by seeking a
court restraining order to stop Evergreen from "unabashedly,
unapologetically attempting to gain control" of the
partnerships.
   Southmark filed eight pages of what it alleged were
misrepresentations by Evergreen principals, including their
purported failure to disclose their former roles in directing
the limited partnerships. A state district judge in Dallas
denied Southmark's request for a restraining order against
Evergreen, and the parties are now negotiating a resolution
of the general partner question, among other issues.
   The negotiations have an added urgency because of hearings
scheduled this week on the confirmation of Southmark's
proposed reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Southmark and its attorneys are scurrying to
clear up any potential hurdles that could trip up the plan.
   Southmark doesn't dispute that its partnerships should
have new general partners who could then choose management
companies to run partnership properties and work on revising
loan agreements. Because many of the properties currently
don't generate enough cash flow to make debt payments, "to
survive long-term, these partnerships are going to need (new)
capital," says Bruce Schnitz, Southmark executive vice
president. But, he says, Southmark is "trying to be cautious
in trying to find" new general partners.
   Certainly, many of Southmark's partnership investors would
like a change. Since Southmark initiated Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization a year ago, it has stopped
subsidizing distributions to partners and halted mortgage
payments on some properties, putting them in danger of
foreclosure. Auditors have questioned whether many of the
partnerships can continue as going concerns.
   Individually, however, investors have almost no say in how
the partnerships are run, and few have the deep pockets or
knowledge to round up the support of other investors and
challenge Southmark in trying to salvage troubled properties.
That makes them dependent on whatever arrangements Southmark
and groups like Evergreen can agree on.
   But whether the Evergreen group offers a worthwhile
alternative is another question. The group and its Limited
Partner Investor Monitoring Committee have been sharply
critical of Southmark for failing to live up to its
projections for the partnerships and have raised questions
about accounting practices since the partnerships were first
offered. The committee provided analyses of Southmark
partnerships to investors for a fee of about 1% of their
original investment, or about $250 on an investment of
$25,000.
   What the committee glosses over is that Messrs. Galston
and Rosen helped put together those projections and monitored
the 33 partnerships and many others as the top executives of
Southmark/Envicon Capital, the unit that marketed private
partnership interests.
   In its request for a restraining order, Southmark claims
that the executives, among other things, "were involved in
determining the price and financial structure of the property
to be acquired by the partnerships . . . developing the
schedule of the limited partners' capital contributions;
structuring the distribution guarantees (and) preparing the
offering memorandum distributed to investors."
   More particularly, Southmark alleged in the filing, "Mr.
Galston has failed to disclose to the limited partners that
he played a major role in management decisions in his
capacity as a general partner of the entity that served as a
general partner of the partnerships."
   Mr. Galston, who left Southmark with Mr. Rosen in August
1988, after the partnership business dried up, contends that
he and his partners simply relied on numbers and data put
together by others at Southmark. He said the two men were
responsible primarily for selling the partnership interests,
while others handled the operations and accounting.
   "We feel we were duped as well," Mr. Galston says. "We put
the (offering) documents together based on information put
together by operating divisions."
   But, argues William S. Friedman, the former vice chairman
of Southmark, "it's a little disingenuous for them to
criticize their own work and say you ought to pay us to fix
things. I don't think a group of extremely well-compensated
former executives should be looked on as potential saviors."
   Messrs. Galston and Rosen argue that if they are elected,
they will try to negotiate lower management fees for the
partnership properties. Currently, the partnerships pay about
5% to 7.5% of their revenue to property managers, many of
which are Southmark affiliates.
   However, Messrs. Galston and Rosen are asking limited
partners to pay a separate fee equal to 1.75% of revenues to
their committee as a general partner's fee; in most cases,
the limited partners already paid fees for a Southmark unit
to be general partner when they purchased partnership
interests.
   Meanwhile, Southmark says in its lawsuit that changing the
general partner could trigger debt covenants that may
automatically put some properties in default. Many of those
mortgages are with San Jacinto Savings Association, a
Southmark unit, or other Southmark affiliates.
   The Evergreen principals dispute Southmark's reading of
the debt covenants, saying that Southmark is actually
threatening to have its affiliates foreclose on the
properties.
   Southmark's private-partnership investors aren't the only
ones under siege. Quest Partners, formed by two former
Southmark salesmen, solicited votes from investors to become
the general partner of three public Southmark partnerships.
The roughly 8,000 investors in those partnerships voted last
month on Quest's solicitation; a final tabulation is expected
within a few weeks.
   Southmark already lost its general partner interest in a
public health-care partnership to Life Care Centers of
America, a closely held company. In part because Life Care
currently manages some Southmark-sponsored properties,
Southmark recently agreed to merge its partly owned National
Heritage Inc. unit with Life Care and turn over general
partner interests in many health-care partnerships to the
Cleveland, Tenn., company. Southmark also is trying to sell a
package of its general partner interests and mortgages in
more than 200 partnerships, as part of its plan to quit the
partnership business and emerge from bankruptcy largely as a
thrift-holding company.
   The partnership tug-of-wars can be trying for even the
most seasoned of investors. Consider Frank Loudermilk, a
retired Kentucky lobbyist, who in 1987 sank $100,000 into a
Southmark/Envicon partnership that purchased a Florida
nursing home. That partnership will be managed by Life Care
if the Life Care-National Heritage merger goes through.
   No investment rookie, Mr. Loudermilk didn't invest until
he had pored over documents and even visited the thriving
facility. But even though the nursing home is 97.5% occupied,
it loses money because of the large interest payments on its
debt, according to partnership financial statements.
   Mr. Loudermilk, acknowledging that he is "completely
confused," decided that he wouldn't vote in the proxy battle,
even though he sent in some money to the Evergreen group.
Instead, he will wait to see if Southmark's agreement with
Life Care improves the future of his investment.
