   NEW YORK -- Coach Leatherwear Co. has filed a lawsuit in
federal court against Ann Taylor, a New York-based women's
retail chain, and two other defendants for selling handbags
that it says copy three of its best-known and recognized
styles.
   In a lawsuit filed on May 21 in the Southern District of
New York, Coach charged that the defendants' sale of
allegedly imitation Coach bags constituted "false
designations of origin and false and misleading descriptions"
with the intention of "creating confusion and deception in
the marketplace . . . and for the purpose of implying an
association between these products sold by Ann Taylor and
Coach."

   Coach seeks a jury trial and damages "in excess of
$500,000."
   Neither Ann Taylor nor the other defendants returned phone
calls seeking comment.
   In court papers, Coach charged that Laura Leather Ltd.,
the manufacturer of the bags, made identical copies of the
Coach handbags and sold them to Ann Taylor. Coach claims that
since 1973 it has sold $400 million worth of handbags.
   "There are millions of versions of Coach bags and Coach
has never complained, but these are exact imitations, you
can't tell the difference," said Daniel Ebenstein, the
attorney representing Coach. He said that "Coach has received
many complaints from Coach customers who believe that we are
making special private-label products for Ann Taylor, which
is reselling them for 30% less than Coach stores."
   He said that since the suit was filed one of the
defendants, Ron's Elegance Center, a New York retail shop,
has agreed to stop selling the handbags.
   "Ann Taylor told us that they have no intention of
reordering the bags, but they are not willing to consent to
an injuntion, therefore we are proceeding with our case," Mr.
Ebenstein said.
