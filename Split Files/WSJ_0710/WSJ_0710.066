   HOUSTON -- The U.S. agreed to differ with West Germany and
Japan on providing aid to the Soviet Union and China, but
leaders of the largest industrial nations still sought a
consensus on contentious economic issues as they opened their
16th annual economic summit meeting here.
   The U.S. has accepted that Germany plans to proceed with
providing financial aid to the Soviet Union, even though the
Bush administration thinks it is too early for help of that
type. The U.S. favors providing only technical assistance
until the Soviets adopt more far-reaching reforms.

   Similarly, the U.S. accepts that Japan is planning to
resume lending to China, even though the U.S. considers such
a move premature after the June 1989 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   A few years ago, when the Soviet threat loomed larger and
the U.S. more clearly dominated the Western alliance, such
divergence between the leading industrial nations would have
been almost inconceivable. But today, West Germany and Japan
have become economic superpowers, and a cash-strapped U.S. is
less willing to test its commanding role by insisting on
unanimity among the allied nations. Moreover, as the Soviet
threat has receded, U.S. military might doesn't assure
political clout to the extent it once did, and economic power
and success have become that much more important.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said President Bush
concedes that the summit partners will take different
approaches on such issues. "The president has understood that
different countries may have different ways of evaluating
specific changes as they come in and balancing those out with
different sets of priorities," Mr. Sununu said.
   But while the U.S. and its partners signaled their
willingness to go separate ways on political issues, the Bush
administration aggressively pressed European nations to agree
to cut trade-distorting subsidies for agricultural goods.
   U.S. and European Community officials said President Bush
argued forcefully for lower trade barriers in agriculture
during a brief meeting with EC President Jacques Delors
Sunday night. And in his remarks at the opening meeting
yesterday, according to White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, the president pressed European leaders to make a
bigger commitment to achieving progress in agriculture in the
current Uruguay Round of international trade talks. The
talks, held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
are set to be completed in December.
   The U.S. thinks the Europeans aren't "fully engaged" in
negotiations to cut agricultural subsidies, according to U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. The EC says it doesn't
accept the contention of the U.S. and many other
food-exporting countries that it must commit itself to cut
export subsidies and price supports for agricultural goods.
"We need to keep the means and policies to support the market
and avoid excessive fluctuation" of prices, Guy Legras, the
EC director general of agriculture, told reporters.
   The Europeans say they believe they are being bludgeoned
by the U.S. on the agricultural trade issue. In news
conferences here yesterday, Mr. Yeutter and White House Trade
Representative Carla Hills castigated the Europeans for their
refusal to negotiate away their export subsidies for
agriculture.
   U.S. officals said they were encouraged by reports that
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had commented favorably on
a recent proposal on agricultural trade made by the chairman
of the agricultural negotiating group, Art de Zeeuw, at GATT
talks in Geneva. But Mr. Legras later criticized Mr. de
Zeeuw's proposal for its insistence on reduction of export
subsidies. Many U.S. and even some European officials think
the GATT proposal eventually may provide a basis for a
compromise.
   The importance that the U.S. attaches to trade talks in
general, and agriculture in particular, is clear; Mr. Sununu
identified agriculture and trade as the main themes of the
summit. He emphasized the need to move trade talks along and
stressed the dangers of failure: "I never want to say that
there is not another bus coming down the street," he said,
but added: "They sometimes don't show up."
   Concerning Western assistance to the Soviet Union, U.S
officials believe the leaders will be able to agree on a
communique that takes account of their different approaches.
West Germany and France favor immediate financial aid, while
the U.S., Japan, Canada and Britain favor a slower and more
cautious course. The exact wording won't be worked out until
tomorrow, according to U.S. officials.
   The U.S. is prepared to provide technical help to the
Soviets. "We have already sent, and our allies have as well,
a number of experts over there," Mr. Sununu said. They are
"addressing issues such as private ownership of property, the
banking structure that is necessary to provide a mechanism to
channel capital to the appropriate areas," transportation and
the storage and movement of grain. Currently, the Soviet
Union loses about half its grain because of transportation
inefficiencies and poor storage conditions, he said.
   The leaders of the seven summit countries -- the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- as
well as the European Community leadership discussed the
Soviet Union and other political issues at dinner last night.
Today, they are scheduled to discuss regional issues, such as
aid for Eastern Europe and President Bush's recent proposals
to help Latin America. This afternoon, they plan to move on
to debt and environmental issues.
   Meanwhile, U.S. environmental groups complained that U.S.
summit planners have given short shrift to environmental
issues. The U.S. has refused to agree to specific plans to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide gases, which some
scientists warn could be increasing global temperatures.
   Mr. Sununu defended the U.S. position, saying the U.S.
already has advanced beyond most other industrialized
countries in environmental controls. He also said that 9% of
carbon dioxide emissions come from natural sources, a comment
environmental activists here took as reminiscent of President
Reagan's famous comment that trees are a source of air
pollution.
   "The U.S. must be a leader in responding to the problem of
global warming," said Sierra Club director Michael Fischer,
adding: "The U.S. has failed to be a leader and is using
stupid reasons not to take the lead."
