   General Dynamics Corp., desperate to keep open its Abrams
tank operation through overseas sales, got a big boost as the
U.S. government finalized a $3 billion-plus deal with Saudi
Arabia.
   The contract, which has long been expected, calls for
General Dynamics to supply a total of 315 next-generation M-1
tanks to the Saudis from 1993 through 1995. General Dynamics
will also supply support equipment, spare parts, training
facilities and munitions.

   Along with a 550-tank co-production agreement with Egypt,
negotiated last year, General Dynamics has moved a
significant step closer to guaranteeing that its assembly
plant in Lima, Ohio, stays open. Success there for the
company would mean, in turn, that its machining shop in
Warren, Mich., also would avoid being shut. General Dynamics,
the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier and the U.S.'s only tank
manufacturer, has said it needs to produce the M-1 at a rate
of at least 360 a year to ensure that one of its two tank
assembly lines can survive.
   General Dynamics has been producing 720 M-1s a year,
accounting for nearly 10% of the St. Louis-based company's
$10 billion in sales in 1989.
   As part of the Bush administration's 1991 budget, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has called for ending purchases of M-1
tanks for the Army next year. But to cushion that blow and
give General Dynamics additional time to try to find other
customers, Mr. Cheney has stressed that the Pentagon's
proposal envisions filling the entire Saudi order.
   "We have no illusions about our tank business," a company
official said yesterday. "But even modest production would be
better than shutting things down entirely." General Dynamics
employs about 2,600 in Ohio and 1,200 in Michigan on the M-1
program.
   Robert Truxell, general manager of General Dynamics' Land
Systems Division, yesterday called the pact with the Saudis
"particularly important."
   "At a time of declining U.S. requirements, international
sales will play a key role in our efforts" to maintain M-1
sales in the 1990s, he said.
   Indeed, while the Saudi transaction still leaves General
Dynamics some 150 tanks short of its minimum annual
production goal -- not including any direct sales to the
Pentagon that may be restored on Capitol Hill -- the signing
of the accord could pave the way for other sales abroad. "We
could see a snowball effect," predicted Rep. Mike Oxley (R.,
Ohio).
   At present, General Dynamics is pitching the Abrams tank
to the United Arab Emirates, Sweden, Kuwait, Pakistan and
Canada. In addition, the British are expected to decide by
the end of the year if they want the M-1 to replace their
aging fleet of Chieftain tanks.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Dynamics shares closed up 87.5 cents at $33.
