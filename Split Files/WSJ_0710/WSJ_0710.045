   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
said 1,584 employees in its Network Services division agreed
to retire this year, under a pension plan that was sweetened
to induce retirements.
   These employees will count toward the division's goal of
cutting 6,000 jobs this year, a division spokesman said.

   AT&amp;T is determining how many targeted job cuts have been
realized as a result of attrition, transfers and promotions,
the spokesman said. The division expects to announce,
possibly as early as today, how many "surplus" employees
still exist and thus are likely to be laid off.
   A spokesman for the New York-based parent company said
AT&amp;T as a whole seeks to eliminate 13,000 jobs this year. The
company initially estimated it would eliminate 10,000 to
12,000 jobs, but later revised the figure.
   The spokesman wasn't able to say how many of the 13,000
targeted jobs have been eliminated so far. But he said about
800 jobs were eliminated during the first quarter in the
Business Communications Systems group.
   AT&amp;T has about 282,000 employees, including about 30,000
in the Network Services division.
   While cutting jobs in many staff and technical categories,
AT&amp;T has been increasing employment in computer sciences,
marketing and sales. A major theme is to increase
revenue-producing jobs, while lowering costs through the use
of new technology to eliminate behind-the-scenes workers, the
spokesman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&amp;T shares closed at $38.25, up 12.5 cents.
