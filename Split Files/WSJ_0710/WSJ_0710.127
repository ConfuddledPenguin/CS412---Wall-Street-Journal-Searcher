   A federal judge in Arkansas ruled that the Resolution
Trust Corp. can't override state laws to sell insolvent
thrifts and their branches to banks.
   The ruling, handed down by Judge Stephen Reasoner,
contradicts a ruling last month by a federal judge in Santa
Fe, N.M., and is sure to be appealed by the RTC.

   The RTC claims that it has the right, under a regulation
that became effective June 1, to ignore certain state laws,
including those restricting banks' abilities to operate
branches. Arkansas, New Mexico and 10 other states impose
varying branch restrictions.
   But Judge Reasoner decided that the RTC overstepped its
authority in adopting the override regulation and declared it
"unlawful, null and void."
   "There is no doubt that the RTC can more effectively carry
out its mandate (to sell thrifts) if it is allowed to
override state law and receive better bids from purchasers,"
Judge Reasoner wrote. "Congress, had it so intended, could
have given such authority to the RTC."
   Because the judge declared the RTC override regulation
null, the ruling may apply to thrift sales in states other
than Arkansas, said Leonard Rosen, an attorney for the
Arkansas State Bank Department and the Arkansas Independent
Bankers Association. "The judge did not say just Arkansas,"
said Mr. Rosen, who is with the law firm of Bracewell &amp;
Patterson in Washington, D.C.
   Mr. Rosen had filed suit on behalf of the Arkansas State
Bank Department to block the sale of an insolvent Arkansas
thrift and its 20 branches to a unit of Worthen Banking Corp.
   Some of the thrift's branches are outside Worthen's home
county, and operating those branches would have put Worthen
in violation of Arkansas state law. Worthen Chairman Curt
Bradbury said the bank holding company will now reconsider
the acquisition of the thrift, Independence Federal Bank,
which has $172 million in assets.
   RTC spokesmen didn't respond to the Arkansas ruling, but
an appeal is expected in light of the contrary ruling issued
last month by federal Judge Santiago Campos of Santa Fe.
   Judge Campos ruled in favor of the RTC and permitted the
sale of a New Mexico thrift and its out-of-county branches to
a New Mexico bank. An appeal of that ruling is pending in
Denver.
