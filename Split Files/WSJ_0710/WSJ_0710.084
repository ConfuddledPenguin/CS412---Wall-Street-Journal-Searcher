   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Nike Inc. said it's now king of the
fitness hill, dethroning Adidas as the best-selling brand in
athletic footwear and apparel.
   Nike also topped its own earnings estimates, posting
record results for the fourth quarter and year as fitness
fans around the world continued to snap up the company's
sports shoes and clothes. Nike said net income for the
quarter ended May 31 surged 84% to a record $67.2 million, or
$1.77 a share, from $36.5 million, or 97 cents a share, the
year earlier. Late last month, the company estimated that net
was between $64 million and $66 million.

   Wall Street responded yesterday by pushing up Nike's stock
by 9.1%; it closed in national over-the-counter trading at
$87.25, up $7.25, on volume of 1,571,200 shares.
   Revenue in the quarter spurted 47% to a high of $609
million from $413.4 million a year earlier, Nike said.
   Nike claimed the title for the world's biggest
athletic-brand sales on record full-year revenue of $2.24
billion. That compares with sales under the Adidas brand name
estimated at about $1.7 billion, a Nike spokewoman said. Nike
added that it also outstripped its biggest domestic
competitor, Reebok International Ltd. For fiscal 1989, Nike's
sales totaled $1.71 billion.
   For fiscal 1990, Nike earned a record $243 million, or
$6.42 a share, up 45% from $167 million, or $4.45 a share, a
year earlier. Last month, Nike said it expected to post net
for the year of $240 million to $242 million.
