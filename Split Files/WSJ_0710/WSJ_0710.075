   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
fined J.W. Gant &amp; Associates Inc., an Englewood, Colo.,
brokerage firm, $30,000 and ordered it and two employees to
return nearly $196,000 to customers because of alleged
overcharges for securities.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm;
Salvatore A. Venezia, a principal and vice president at Gant;
and James S. Gad, a representative and trader at the firm,
consented to the sanctions.

   The NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter market, charged that Gant charged excessive
markups for the initial public penny-stock offering of what
the agency identified only as a Colorado producer of a
soy-based, non-dairy, frozen dessert.
   The initial offering consisted of units priced at 10 cents
a piece; each unit included a common share plus a warrant.
   The firm "dominated and controlled the market" for the
securities and used that position to sell the securities "at
markups ranging from 11% to 184% over the prevailing market
price," the NASD said.
   Mr. Gad declined to comment; Mr. Venezia couldn't be
reached. The NASD also suspended both Messrs. Gad and Venezia
for 15 days.
   The firm was suspended for six months from making markets
in and executing transactions as a principal in securities
that aren't traded on the NASD's Automated Quotation System,
unless some part of the securities is traded on Nasdaq.
   Gant previously was the subject of a disciplinary
proceeding; the NASD fined the firm $2,500 for failing to
maintain minimum net capital.
