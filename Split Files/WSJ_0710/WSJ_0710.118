   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
a French businessman agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle
insider-trading charges in connection with Rhone-Poulenc SA's
bid for Rorer Group Inc.
   The agency said Robert Rossi, who settled the charges
without admitting or denying guilt, purchased stock and
options in Rorer while in possession of material nonpublic
information that the Fort Washington, Pa., drug company was
to be the target of a bid by the state-owned French drug and
chemical concern. Mr. Rossi is an import and export trader
who lives in Africa, according to his attorney.

   Mr. Rossi's lawyer, Daniel A. Pollack, said his client was
wrongly charged by the SEC but settled the charges to avoid
protracted litigation in the U.S. Mr. Rossi's "trading was
purely of his own analysis," Mr. Pollack said. "He knows no
one at Rorer, he knows no one at Rhone-Poulenc, he knows no
one in the French government."
   Mr. Rossi's settlement -- one of the SEC's largest against
a foreign investor -- contrasts with recent SEC efforts to
impose tough fines on alleged insider traders. Mr. Rossi's
$1.4 million payout consists totally of disgorgement of
alleged profit and a small amount of interest. SEC attorneys
wouldn't say why there was no fine in the case.
   The SEC said Mr. Rossi acknowledged that he bought Rorer
securities for his own account through Discount Bank Ltd. and
Cambio Valorenbank AG, two Swiss banks that were cited in the
agency's original complaint. Neither bank has been charged
with wrongdoing.
   The settlement is the first in the Rorer case. In January,
even before Rhone-Poulenc was revealed to be the bidder, the
SEC charged Mr. Rossi and four foreign companies with insider
trading that allegedly netted a total of nearly $6 million.
Rorer subsequently was acquired by Rhone-Poulenc for about
$3.23 billion.
   Another defendant, Holding Protection Ltd., of Greece, is
to go on trial later this month, according to SEC lawyers.
Two other defendants, Unifund SAL, of Lebanon, and Tamanaco
Saudi &amp; Gulf Investment Group, of Panama, are appealing
preliminary injunctions granted by a federal court in New
York. Charges have been dismissed against a fourth defendant,
Fondation Hai, of Monaco, the SEC lawyers said.
   The case is the second major insider-trading flap in
recent years to emerge from a French deal. The SEC last year
asked French legal authorities to investigate whether
investors friendly to President Francois Mitterrand and
France's Socialist Party conducted questionable trades while
Pechiney SA was negotiating to acquire American National Can
Co.
