   PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange said it
plans to extend its trading day in foreign-currency options,
beginning Sept. 16.
   The exchange said its current 14-hour trading day will be
stretched to 19.5 hours during months of daylight-saving
time, to coincide with afternoon trading in the Far East and
in Pacific Rim countries. In fall and winter months, the
trading day will become 20.5 hours.

   New hours will run from 7 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT the
following day. Current hours run from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT
and from 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT. During fall and winter,
trading will begin at 6 p.m. EST.
   In September 1987, the exchange introduced an evening
trading session for foreign-currency options to accommodate
increased demand in the Far East. In January 1989, the
exchange added an early-morning session to accommodate the
European market.
   Total daily volume in currency-option contracts traded on
the exchange has grown to represent about $2 billion in
underlying value.
