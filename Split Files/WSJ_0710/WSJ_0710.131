   Kings and presidents are beginning to take a hand in
efforts of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to try to stop the fall in oil prices.
   Several heads of state of major OPEC members suddenly are
stepping in, where their oil ministers have failed, to try to
curb the organization's overproduction as petroleum markets
weaken from the glut.

   One reason is the mounting loss in revenues for OPEC's 13
member nations -- now about $100 million a day -- from the
drop of one-third in the price of petroleum so far this year.
Also, concern is growing that the oil oversupply will trigger
a crash similar to the 1986 collapse that drove the price of
oil as low as $7 a barrel.
   "It's hurting them to the point where they are going to do
something, at least to contain the damage, and a decision to
do something has to come at the heads of state level," said
Paul Mlotok, an oil economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and Suharto of Indonesia are among those taking a
harder line toward the quota cheaters, such as Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, which are held responsible for OPEC's
overproduction. But the king of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's chief
producer, seems to be emerging in the leading role in
charting the new strategy.
   Further evidence of this development came from the Saudi
government. According to an official statement issued by the
Saudi Press Agency, Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, was
quoted as saying King Fahd is "fully committed to restoring
stability to the oil markets."
   Though technical factors also were cited, some oil
analysts said this may have helped spark a late-day rally on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, after several days of
decline. The futures price of crude oil for August delivery
surged in the last few minutes of trading yesterday, to
settle at $16.58 a barrel, up 11 cents from Friday's close,
after falling to a low of $16.05 during the day. Crudes
elsewhere were mostly lower, with North Sea spot prices
dropping between five cents and 45 cents a barrel.
   A report that the Soviet Union, facing a lack of fuel for
domestic use, will cut its oil exports by 140,000 barrels a
day had little impact on world markets. According to the Dow
Jones International Petroleum Report, however, rumors which
were later confirmed that Phibro Energy Inc. sold three
million barrels of North Sea crudes for July loading to the
U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve gave crude spot and futures
prices a boost late in the day.
   The Saudi statement didn't elaborate on steps being taken
by King Fahd, except to quote Mr. Nazer further as saying the
kingdom is exerting "maximum efforts" toward the success of
the OPEC midyear meeting, which is to begin July 25 in
Geneva. Also, the statement noted that Mr. Nazer's comments
were made during a briefing to the Saudi cabinet on his
recent meetings with other Persian Gulf ministers.
   In the past few days, Mr. Nazer has carried a message from
his king regarding the oil situation to Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Iraq and Qatar; today, Mr. Nazer's
counterparts from Kuwait, the UAE and Iraq are to meet with
him in Saudi Arabia, in what some oil analysts suggest could
result in a Saudi-engineered compromise proposal to be placed
before the Geneva meeting of all the oil ministers.
Speculation is that such a plan would call for both Kuwait
and the UAE to cut back on output through the third quarter,
in return for higher official quotas in the fourth quarter.
   Iraq's full backing would be necessary for such a plan to
work. The Iraqi president, who wants higher oil prices to
help meet costs of the reconstruction of his country
following its eight-year war against Iran, has been
particularly irritated about the way Kuwait and the UAE have
ignored their quotas.
   Mr. Hussein of Iraq is hardly alone in his irritation. In
Jakarta Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,
told reporters after a meeting with his president that "there
is no use talking about quotas if the price remains low." He
said that a number of OPEC members have failed to keep their
pledge to help shore up the price of oil by cutting output,
and that OPEC discussions should focus on efforts to improve
the market instead of "wasting time and energy debating on
quota distribution."
   In Caracas, meanwhile, the president of Venezuela also
called for production discipline in OPEC. "Regarding that
situation," he said, "we are promoting a summit meeting of
heads of state . . . of OPEC member countries, which we hope
could take place during the course of this year." Such a
summit, he said, would "discuss current and future issues of
the oil business and reach definite agreements that would
further strengthen" OPEC.
