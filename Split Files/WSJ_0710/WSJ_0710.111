   Federal mediators overseeing contract talks between
Eastern Airlines and its pilots union declared an impasse,
setting off a 30-day countdown toward a strike or a
settlement.
   The union, the Air Line Pilots Association, immediately
said it would send strike ballots to its members.

   It's unlikely, however, that a strike would have anywhere
near the impact of last year's strike by machinists, which
was supported by pilots and flight attendants. That strike,
in March 1989, nearly grounded Eastern and tipped the
financially ailing carrier into bankruptcy court. Eastern
painstakingly built itself back to about 80% of its
pre-strike operations, and the pilots and flight attendants
ended their walkouts in November.
   The makeup of the pilot work force is starkly different
this time. The 1,900 pilots now flying for Eastern -- about
half of the pre-strike total -- are evenly split between
recently hired replacements and pilots who crossed the picket
line. Neither group has any reason to show special loyalty to
the pilots union. Only 89 pilots who went out on strike
before have been recalled. Union officials estimate that an
additional 1,403 are waiting to return. Under labor law,
however, the pilots union is still the bargaining agent for
all pilots working for Eastern.
   "The so-called strike vote they're talking about would be
polling pilots who aren't working," said an Eastern
spokeswoman. "It would be a non-event."
   The union's contract expired in mid-1988, but under
airline labor law, the old contract remains in effect until a
new one is negotiated or the National Mediation Board finds
the two sides are at an impasse. That happened when the board
proferred arbitration to the two sides, and the union
accepted while Eastern refused.
   The issues that brought this confrontation to a head are
an outgrowth of the previous strike's ultimate failure. Both
sides essentially agree on the financial aspects of a new
contract, and pilots say they are prepared to make
significant wage concessions because their main concerns
center on job guarantees. Pilot negotiators say Eastern
offered to provide only 510 jobs over the next three years
for formerly striking pilots. The pilots also want to
reattain their pre-strike seniority, but Eastern says it
won't downgrade the replacement pilots who saw the company
through the strike.
   In a statement, the pilots union also charged that Eastern
required that all pilot grievances, claims and lawsuits be
dropped before any contract could be signed. The union said
that included claims against Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. which holds the equity in Eastern and, until April,
controlled the carrier. Continental Airlines Holdings is the
new name for Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern, which countered by saying the pilots demanded
that all litigation against the union be dropped, said those
issues are "totally extraneous."
   Complicating dealings between the two sides is Eastern's
status in bankruptcy court. Until spring, Eastern had been a
unit of Texas Air, but Eastern's creditors grew frustrated by
the constantly changing reorganization plans from Texas Air's
chairman, Frank Lorenzo. In April, at the creditors request,
the bankruptcy court removed Texas Air from day-to-day
management and appointed a trustee, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr.
Shugrue has consistently maintained that labor peace is one
of his goals, but so far he has had no luck in negotiating
with either the pilots or the still-striking machinists.
Pilots have charged that Mr. Shugrue's words are a "stalling
tactic."
   Furthermore, despite bankruptcy court protection, Eastern
continues to be unprofitable. The airline has said its
break-even load factor, the percentage of seats it needs to
fill, stands at 80%. But in May, load factor was 54%. June
traffic hasn't been disclosed yet.
