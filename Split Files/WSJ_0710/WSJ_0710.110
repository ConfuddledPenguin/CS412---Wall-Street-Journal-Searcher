   Net investment in the stocks of one country's companies by
investors in another country soared to a record $92.3 billion
last year, nearly triple the previous high of $31.7 billion
set in 1986, a Salomon Brothers Inc. study found.
   The firm said that gross cross-border equity investment
climbed to a record $1.6 trillion last year -- or 14.5% of
world stock turnover -- from $1.2 trillion a year earlier.
British money managers led the way, followed by those from
the U.S. and Japan. Swiss portfolio managers ranked fourth.

   These numbers mean that one stock transaction out of every
seven world-wide involves a foreign investor. Ten years ago,
that ratio was less than one in every 16, according to
Salomon.
   As of last year, the value of international shares held by
foreign investors stood at $830 billion, or 7.2% of the
aggregate value of world stock markets, up from $640 billion
in 1988.
   Still, Salomon said: "We believe the globalization of
equity markets has significantly further to go." The firm
estimated that the average investment portfolio contains less
than 10% of international assets, compared to what Salomon
contends should be an optimal level of 15%-20%.
