   NEW YORK -- The number of corporate name changes dropped
14% in 1989 from 1988, to 1,600 from a record 1,864, with
half the latest total reflecting mergers and acquisitions,
said Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a consulting firm.
   For example, a pair of combinations -- Time Inc. with
Warner Communications Inc., and Bristol-Myers Co. with Squibb
Corp. -- produced Time Warner Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.

   Elective name changes -- those made for reasons other than
merger, downsizing or reorganization -- represented 16% of
the total, the consultants said. Among them in 1989 were Gulf
&amp; Western Inc. becoming Paramount Communications Inc. and
Home Group Inc. taking on the name AmBase Corp., the firm
said.
   Companies also change their names to reflect their entry
into or withdrawal from markets and to take advantage of a
particularly prominent product. One-quarter of the changes in
1989 were spurred by divestitures, asset sales, spinoffs and
leveraged buy-outs, the firm said. F.W. Woolworth Co.
switched to Woolworth Corp. when it became a holding company.
   Acquisitions of U.S. firms by foreign firms led to
Stauffer Chemical Corp. becoming Rhone-Poulenc Basic
Chemicals Inc. and Pennwalt Corp. becoming Atochem.
