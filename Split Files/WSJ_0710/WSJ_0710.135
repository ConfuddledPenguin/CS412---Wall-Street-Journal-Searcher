   CHICAGO -- The federal assault on trading fraud at
Chicago's big futures markets received a major setback in its
first courtroom test.
   A jury was able to reach guilty verdicts on only eight of
the more than 100 criminal counts filed against three Swiss
franc futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The
jury reached verdicts of not guilty on 22 counts and were
deadlocked on 86 counts. The jury found one defendant not
guilty on two counts and was deadlocked on 12 other counts.

   The jury wasn't able to reach a verdict on more than
two-thirds of the counts. Judge Ann Williams declared a
mistrial on the counts on which the jury was deadlocked.
   Prosecutors said they likely would attempt to retry the
case on the undecided counts. Defense attorneys say that a
retrial would be a travesty of justice. "The government gave
this their best shot," one attorney said. Even if the counts
are retried, the government has already lost the valuable
momentum it would have gained from an overwhelming number of
guilty verdicts in the first trial.
   "Any time the government convicts on only eight of more
than 100 counts in an investigation of this magnitude, it's a
major setback," said Robert Tarun, a defense attorney and
former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago.
   Even the guilty verdicts were a Pyrrhic victory for the
government's multimillion-dollar investigation of fraud on
the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, which spanned more
than two years and involved the use of undercover agents on
the floors of the exchanges.
   Robert Mosky, 34 years old, who had been charged with 82
counts, was found guilty of seven counts, all relatively
lesser violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The jury
found him not guilty on 20 counts and was deadlocked on 55
counts.
   The jury found trader Danny Scheck, 28, guilty on one
count of violating the act, for a trade that allegedly cost a
futures trading customer $50, said his attorney Harvey
Silets. The jury was deadlocked on the remaining 19 counts
against Mr. Scheck.
   David Zatz, 43, the third defendant, was found not guilty
on two counts of CEA violations, with the jury deadlocked on
the remaining 12 counts against him.
   The jury's surprise actions could cripple the
unprecedented government probe. It casts doubt on the
government's ability to extend significantly the
investigation's reach beyond the 48 individuals indicted on
fraud charges last year at the Merc and the CBOT.
   The government will be forced to reconsider plans to
indict many more traders if the evidence against them isn't
any stronger than that rejected by the jury in the
Swiss-franc case.
   The jury's action also could embolden already indicted
traders. The verdict all but eliminates the chance that any
of the 29 indicted traders to be tried in September in two
separate proceedings will plead guilty and cooperate with
prosecutors before going to trial, defense attorneys said.
   The jury was deadlocked on the most significant charge in
the trial: a conspiracy count against Mr. Mosky under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
The deadlock could rekindle criticism of government
overreaching in the probe. If found guilty of racketeering,
Mr. Mosky could have been forced to forfeit such assets as
his exchange membership as well as profits earned when the
alleged conspiracy was taking place.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner defended the use
of RICO. When asked if he thought the jury's partial verdict
was an embarrassment for the government and a misuse of
government resources, he said, "I don't think people who
invest in the commodity markets would agree."
   The verdict is not a clean bill of health for the futures
industry. The jury in the criminal trial had to find that the
evidence proved the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. But the evidence, especially testimony from Mark
Fuhrman and William Walsh, two Swiss-franc traders who
pleaded guilty to fraud and testified against the defendants,
depicted the Merc pit as corrupt.
   Sixteen of the 48 indicted individuals from both exchanges
have pleaded guilty to fraud and are cooperating with the
probe.
   Mr. Fuhrman said he had been stealing customer profits
since the late 1970s in a handful of Merc trading pits,
including the Swiss-franc pit. Mr. Walsh, 22 years old when
the alleged fraud was carried out, described skimming
customer profits as one of the survival skills successful
traders had to master on the Merc floor. He said he made
illegal trades several times a month in the Swiss-franc pit.
   After the federal investigation of futures trading fraud
surfaced early last year both the Merc and the Board of Trade
took a number of steps to tighten trading operations. The
exchanges stiffened penalties for trading violations and
passed other rule changes aimed at making fraudulent trades
easier to detect. Both exchanges also are developing
hand-held terminals for pit brokers that are designed to
create a better audit trail that will enable exchange
surveillance staff to detect fraud.
   Mr. Silets said the verdicts "demonstrate the jury wasn't
convinced there was a conspiracy to cheat and defraud
customers in the Swiss-franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange." Even though Mr. Scheck and Mr. Zatz weren't
charged with racketeering conspiracy, the government alleged
that they took part in the trading conspiracy that was the
basis for the RICO charge against Mr. Mosky.
   Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky's attorney, said, "there are
many things about the government's theory that the jury
didn't buy." He added, "I don't think anything about this
case was appropriate" for the use of RICO charges against Mr.
Mosky.
   The prosecution alleged, among other things, that the
traders conspired to keep Mr. Mosky from absorbing trading
losses on customer orders by arranging for Mr. Scheck and Mr.
Zatz, as well as other unindicted Swiss-franc traders, to
accept losing trades into their accounts. Mr. Mosky then
allegedly repaid them with non-competitive trades on which
they could immediately earn a profit in the pit. The
government claimed these profits belonged to Mr. Mosky's
customers.
   The jury members deliberated for 11 days and nearly 70
hours before telling the judge that further deliberations
wouldn't help them reach a decision on the remaining counts.
   The jury apparently wasn't persuaded by the more than 100
snippets of taped conversations in the Swiss-franc pit and
elsewhere that the government claimed proved the traders were
guilty of 116 counts of fraud. The jurors asked for the
complete trial transcript of more than 4,000 pages to help
reach a decision. Last week, the jury told the judge they
were deadlocked on an unspecified number of counts. She sent
them back to the jury room at that time and instructed them
to reconsider every count.
   Last Friday the jury said it would be able to reach a
verdict if it were allowed to visit the Merc floor and
observe trading in the Swiss-franc pit. Judge Williams denied
the request, apparently agreeing with prosecutors that a
visit would be equivalent to admitting new evidence into the
trial record.
   The final note saying the jury was deadlocked was sent to
the judge yesterday afternoon. Sentencing was set for Nov. 2
regarding the guilty verdicts against Mr. Mosky and Mr.
Scheck.
   A Chicago Merc spokesman said the exchange's board of
governors will discuss at their regular meeting tomorrow what
action, if any, to take against the convicted traders.
