   BOISE, Idaho -- Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it got a
contract to complete work valued at $70 million on a
chemical-destruction facility at a Utah Army depot.
   Knudsen said EG&amp;G Inc.'s EG&amp;G Defense Materials Inc. of
Wellesley, Mass., selected the company to complete an
incinerator at the Toole, Utah, Army depot that is designed
to destroy so-called "defense chemicals," such as nerve gas,
that are stored at the depot. Knudsen said it replaced the
subcontractor that began the project, which is scheduled for
completion in March 1992.
