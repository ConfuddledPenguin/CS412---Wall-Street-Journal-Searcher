   BLAME BOSSES if quality is poor, workers say. Middle
managers agree.
   Workers at 12 major companies surveyed by consultant
Brooks International overwhelmingly insist they are
personally committed to meeting quality standards, and most
believe fellow workers also try hard. If there is a stumbling
block to quality, look to top management, they contend.
Two-thirds of the workers say "the quality of work done is
not an important measure of performance in my group," and
only a quarter believe "management does an excellent job of
rewarding work groups who make quality improvement
recommendations."

   Middle managers share the disenchantment. While 78% of top
executives declare "management is committed to achieving and
maintaining the highest quality levels possible," only 52% of
midlevel managers, 46% of first-line supervisors and 43% of
workers share the view. Top managers talk quality "but their
behavior is different from their words," asserts George
Bubrick, Brooks International's president. He cites one
company that pressed employees for quality improvements but
based rewards solely on the number of units produced.
   As perceived by workers and midlevel executives, top
management "isn't driven by quality," Mr. Bubrick says.
                                                                                                       

   WE ARE COMMITTED, companies aver. Some credit workers for
showing the way.
   At Federal Express Co., "it wasn't easy" getting top
management to back a new quality program, says John West,
quality-improvement manager. But first-line and middle
managers formed action committees that proved the process
works. Now, he says, "the small fires have spread to big
fires." But David Shorrock, executive vice president of
Reflectone Inc., insists quality isn't the domain of either
top management or workers. "It's a way of life," he says.
   Neil Keith, manufacturing vice president of Intergraph
Corp., concedes workers in the past had seen management as
indifferent to quality, but Intergraph, he says, pushes the
issue "from the highest level down." Westinghouse Electric
Corp.'s commercial nuclear fuel division boasts it held back
a shipment -- snapping a three-year on-time delivery record
-- when a test that later proved erroneous suggested a
product may have been defective. That, says the company, sent
a strong signal to workers about management's priorities.
                                                                                                       

   HEAL THYSELF] Workers are asked to pick up more of the
health-benefit load.
   Best Products Co., which had been paying the full cost of
medical insurance for its 5,000 full-time employees, in
February started asking the workers to pay a 15% share.
Allegheny Power System Inc. raised employee premiums 10% and
increased the deductibles that workers must absorb. Fair
Lanes Inc. pares its burden by paying bonuses to workers who
opt out of its coverage for a spouse's plan.
   Spartan Motors Inc. turned to self insurance to cope with
its rising cost, and it says the switch is saving $200,000 a
year, about 10%. Detroit Edison Co. figures it slowed its
cost increase to 7% from 15% a year by offering three new
managed-care options and adding deductibles and copayments to
its basic indemnity plan. Still, catastrophic illnesses
confound health-coverage programs.
   Bowne &amp; Co. says just three cases last year accounted for
15% of its total medical-benefits bill.
                                                                                                       

   MASS LAYOFFS jumped 23% last year. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics says 572,143 workers were laid off for 31 days or
more last year in the 44 states that kept a tally of layoffs
involving at least 50 workers.
                                                                                                       

   UNION RANKS in manufacturing eased to 23.8% of employment
last year from 24.9% in 1988, CPAs Grant Thornton says.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN HOLD a quarter to half the management jobs at 22% of
the major companies surveyed by Catalyst, a group that
fosters female careers. But they have less than 5% of top
management spots.
                                                                                                       

   NO BUTTS. One in three firms bans smoking, up from one in
four last year, says the Administrative Management Society.
                                                                                                       

   ODD MEN OUT. Breaks in career are costly for men. Women
fare better.
   Male executives who interrupt their expected continuous
climb up the corporate ladder even once -- either by their
own choice or because they're let go -- pay for the gaps with
smaller paychecks and less job satisfaction, two management
researchers find. Joy Schneer of Rutgers and Frieda Reitman
of Pace say a study of M.B.A. graduates shows one in eight
men with single job breaks earning $14,800 a year under, or
21% below, males with continuous employment. And they're less
content.
   Women are twice as likely as men to take career breaks,
usually to raise a child, while men are most often forced out
in a corporate restructuring. But the women bounce back.
Their earnings drop only $5,600, or 9%, below the pay of
continuously employed women, and there is little difference
in job satisfaction. If anything, say the researchers, the
greatest discrimination is against women who don't take time
off.
   They need six more years of work experience to match the
pay of men who also have no break in their careers.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Goodyear Tire worker Carman Davis persuades
National City Bank, Akron, Ohio, to print without charge "We
ride on Goodyear tires" on the personal checks of Goodyear
workers. . . . The average executive each day wastes 72
minutes on unnecessary meetings and 15 minutes waiting on
hold, says Accountemps, ignoring time wasted on surveys.
