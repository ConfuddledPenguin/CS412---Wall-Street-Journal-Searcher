   States are doing more to encourage small businesses to
provide health insurance voluntarily.
   In Virginia, Washington and Florida, new laws permit
experimental, limited coverage for small companies that don't
already offer health benefits. Connecticut recently passed a
law that temporarily reduces rates for such small firms and
establishes a pooling arrangement to cover people with
existing medical conditions. Other states are starting still
more programs.

   While an estimated two-thirds of small businesses
nationwide offer health coverage, more than a third of the
nation's approximately 31 million uninsured people are
affiliated with small firms. And rates are going up for those
companies that do offer coverage. According to a survey early
this year by National Small Business United, a
Washington-based group, insurance rates increased between 16%
and 35% this year over last for 38% of the business owners
polled.
   To cut costs, the new laws in Virginia, Washington and
Florida exempt the barebones small-group policies from state
mandates to cover certain medical treatments. The insurers
can instead offer coverage for hospitalization and basic
physician's care. State laws requiring carriers to cover such
items as treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, mammograms and
psychiatric and chiropractic care can raise rates by 17% to
20%.
   Some small-business owners are enthusiastic. Gerald Roscoe
hasn't been able to afford health insurance for employees at
his two-year-old general contracting firm in Lexington, Va.
"I own the bloody company, and I'm not insured," he says. But
he's interested in Virginia's new program. "To grow, we need
to attract squared-away people who are responsible with their
lives," he says. "One of the ways we can do that is by
offering health insurance."
   Because the laws just took effect, insurance companies are
still drawing up specific plans. Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Virginia, which offers about a third of all policies in
the state, will begin marketing its basic health plan next
month. It's expected to cost eligible small employers about
$80 a month per worker, compared with an average (for all
carriers in the state) of about $130 monthly per employee.
The company has added a limit of $50,000 in medical expenses
per calendar year to further lower the cost. To qualify, a
company can't have offered employees health coverage for the
last year.
   Similar plans are cropping up in other states as well.
Blue Cross companies in Oklahoma and California recently
started offering small groups bare-bones lower-cost insurance
policies, says Gregory Scanlon, director of Blue Cross Blue
Shield Association, which represents 74 independent,
nonprofit state insurance plans. In Oklahoma, the policy
costs from $22.50 a month for those under 19 to $123 monthly
for people 64 and older.
   "It's a step in the right direction," says Thomas Inman,
president of Virginia Home Medical, a Newport News, Va.,
medical supply company that already provides health insurance
for its workers. But he warns that the price of even a
bare-bones policy may be high for a company with a history of
medical problems. Health insurance rates for his company shot
up 62% this year, to $26,000 annually for 22 workers, he
says. The rates skyrocketed after the wife of one of his
employees contracted cancer and diabetes.
   Small businesses that already offer insurance say such
steep rate increases can quickly make the benefit impossible
to afford. Mr. Inman says if his health insurance rate nearly
doubles again, he'll have to drop the benefit.
   Typically, small employers lack access to insurance from
any carrier if they don't have many employees or one of their
workers already has a condition requiring medical care.
IMSCO, a Newark, Ohio, company with four employees, lost its
hospitalization policy after one employee had seven major
operations to correct a life-threatening condition and the
owner had heart bypass surgery. "Nobody wanted to cover us.
One insurance agent even got mad that he had wasted time
coming out to our office," says the company's president, Gary
Stansbury. The group finally got insurance when a health
maintenance organization accepted the group by mistake and
couldn't legally reverse the decision.
   Regulators and small-business officials are optimistic
that the experimental programs will lead to broader efforts
both to hold down costs and to increase coverage. "This is
one step that's the first of many, but it can immediately
show results," says Gary Smith, director of the Independent
Business Association of Washington state. He says small firms
with fewer than 10 workers in the state now pay 40% more for
the same health care contract offered to businesses with more
than 50 employees.
   There's considerably less confidence that the Connecticut
plan will help entrepreneurs. There, the lower rates for
small businesses will result partly from an agreement that
hospitals and other health care providers will accept less
money over the next three years to care for the newly insured
patients. And all companies will pay into the fund covering
those with poor health.
   "This {legislation} will guarantee that for a limited
period, everybody working in Connecticut will be able to
acquire coverage at some price," says John Polk, executive
director of the Council of Smaller Enterprises, a Cleveland
group that purchases health insurance for its member
companies.
   But he charges that the law will allow steep rate
increases and require inclusion of all state-mandated medical
care. "It's my sense that what insurers are intending to do
here is not change the way they do business but change the
way they explain their current behavior," he says.
   The National Association of Manufacturers says most of its
members with fewer than 25 employees offer health insurance.
"Affordability is more the issue for them," says Sharon
Canner, the association's health policy director. "There's
some belief that costs could go up {under the Connecticut
plan} because all employers contribute to the high-risk
pool."
   Mr. Scanlon of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association agrees
that the Connecticut plan is unlikely to reduce rates. "I'm
concerned that after a couple of years, policy makers will
say, `Where's the result?' They'll feel as though they've
been misled," he says.
   Many businesses say the insurance would be more affordable
if they could tailor their coverage. Diane Orlowski, a
co-owner of J.F.D. Tube &amp; Coil Products Inc. of Hamden,
Conn., complains that she must provide coverage for maternity
care and counseling for drug abuse and psychological problems
even though the services are rarely used by her 22-member
work force.
   "I get a lot of raised eyebrows when an employee leaves
and I ask them if they want to continue their health
insurance on their own," she says. Under a 1986 federal law,
workers have the right to extend coverage. Ms. Orlowski says
that because of the expense, her employees rarely extend
their health coverage.
   Despite the doubts, the Health Insurance Association of
America says the Connecticut law reflects many of the
principles governing service to small groups that it adopted
early this year. At that time, the industry trade group said
that it favors limits on how much rates can vary for
similarly situated companies; establishing a national,
nonprofit reinsurance mechanism to pay medical bills for
high-risk individuals; and an end to significantly increasing
a company's insurance rate because one worker has a health
problem. The National Federation of Independent Business, the
Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Manufacturers and
National Small Business United support those proposals.
   "There's no instant solution; it'll take three years,"
Carl Schram, the insurance association's president, says of
the Connecticut program. "But we go into this with great hope
that it'll operate to solve the problem."
