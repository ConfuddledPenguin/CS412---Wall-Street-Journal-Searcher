   ATLANTA -- Three men, part of a closely knit group of
computer hackers calling themselves the Legion of Doom,
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud BellSouth Corp. of
computer information.
   In February, the three men, Franklin E. Darden Jr., 24
years old, of Norcross, Ga.; Adam E. Grant, 22, and Robert J.
Riggs, 22, both of Atlanta, were indicted as participants in
an alleged scheme to disrupt telephone service in the
Southeast.

   BellSouth, through two subsidiaries, oversees phone
service in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and the Carolinas.
   Yesterday, Mr. Darden and Mr. Riggs each pleaded guilty to
one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud. Both face a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Mr. Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more devices
that provided access to BellSouth computers with intent to
commit fraud. He faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a
$250,000 fine.
   Neither Mr. Riggs nor Mr. Grant could be reached for
comment. Mr. Darden said he had agreed to cooperate with
BellSouth in helping to secure the company's computer
systems. Acknowledging that he was "more or less a hacker,"
Mr. Darden said his actions were simply a hobby at first. "I
hope anybody that's hacking out there now hears this and
stops," he added. Sentencing for all three men is set for
Sept. 14.
   A hacker is a person who attempts to gain unauthorized
access to computer files in various systems.
   The U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Joe Whitley, said yesterday
that the three individuals belonged to the so-called Legion
of Doom, a cadre of 15 computer hackers in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states.
   Mr. Whitley said the group disrupted the
telecommunications industry, monitored private telephone
lines, stole proprietary information, stole and modified
credit information, fraudulently obtained property from
various companies, and disseminated information that allowed
other computer hackers to enter BellSouth and other computer
systems.
