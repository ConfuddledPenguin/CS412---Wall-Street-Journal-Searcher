   They bought and sold homes like traders in the pork-belly
pit.
   It was the 1980s, and hundreds of thousands of baby
boomers, two-income couples with ready access to credit, were
buying New York real estate. Frenzied buyers bid against one
another even for small, dark fifth-floor walkups, terrified
they might be snatched away by someone smarter.

   Buying a home was the ultimate investment: tax advantages,
sure appreciation -- and, incidentally, a place to sleep.
Many buyers never considered actually settling down in those
places. They were pit stops on the way to bigger and better.
   Today, with the New York real estate market suffering, a
generation of people who thought of houses as investments
first and homes second is reordering the priorities. These
days, when baby boomers buy a house, they often are really
buying a home.
   "I don't hear much about the investment potential in real
estate these days," says John Berard, who has moved to
Washington, D.C., and is about to put his New York co-op
apartment on the market. "It's a lot more important to me to
find a place that's comfortable than one that will pay me a
big dividend in a few years."
   Gail Belsky bought a new New York apartment before she'd
sold her old one; finally, after 18 months, she sold the
first apartment and now, staggered, is going to try to sell
the second apartment, too. "I'm certainly not going to raise
a family in this apartment and grow old and retire here. I
wish someone had said to me, `No, no, no, don't buy until
you're ready to stay for a long time,'" she says.
   "If you stop factoring in the home and hearth part of the
equation," she adds, "you fall prey to the rise and fall of
the marketplace."
   That probably sounds like basic common sense to older
generations, who rented apartments or lived with parents
until they could afford to buy what they assumed might be
their lifetime home. Many of them never realized a dime on
real estate. "My grandfather died on the front steps of the
house he came to in 1920," says Mr. Berard. "My grandmother
still lives there. I think that generation was more concerned
about making sure they had what they needed."
   But members of later generations often bought into a
relatively modern notion that people have a right to a
different, and perfect, home for each stage of their lives.
"After World War II, there was a growing sense that a family
was in some ways created or affirmed by a particular house,"
says Gwendolyn Wright, professor of architecture at Columbia
University. "Builders and architects were advertising, `Have
a house that looks like your family.'" So there was the right
house for being a single young person, for being a young
couple, for being a young couple with small children.
   The baby boomers married later than their parents and
started having children later, too. "We had more time to live
in more different places," says Jack Berkowitz, whose New
York loft has been on the market since October.
   And because of ever-rising prices of their ever-changing
homes, they got spoiled. Sandra Marx, a New York talent agent
who's trying to sell a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op in
Manhattan, grew up in a 1,000-square-foot apartment in
Queens. "I wouldn't even rent it now as a pied-a-terre," she
says. "For my parents it was suitable. But we're brats. We
were trained to be brats."
   Nowhere was all this more obvious than in the brat
capital, New York, where people who didn't churn the
real-estate market were considered either naive or just plain
foolish. In the 1980s, demand overwhelmed the area's chronic
housing shortage. Between 1981 and 1987, the median price of
a single-family house in the New York metropolitan area rose
more than 150%, according to the National Association of
Realtors.
   "I never saw anything like it, and I've been in the
business since World War II," says William Thomas, regional
vice president of the Realtors' association. "People were
bidding against one another on houses. That was a unique
situation. That was a buying frenzy."
   Today, many of those same eager bidders have become
desperate sellers. Thanks to the October 1987 stock market
crash and resulting layoffs, apartments that once sold in a
week now sit on the market for six, 12, 18 months. Prices are
lowered notch by painful notch.
   Housing prices in the New York area, which were the
highest in the nation in 1986 and 1987, now have been
surpassed by other areas, including Orange County, Calif.,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and even Buffalo, N.Y.
   The softness of New York's market is "paralleling what's
happened in other areas," says Brian Bragg, editor of U.S.
Housing Markets, a research and statistics publication. "The
prime example is Texas, then New England, and now it's
working its way down the whole Eastern Seaboard. In New York,
where prices had escalated so badly, the chickens are really
coming home to roost."
   The problem is that as people decide to buy a home for the
long term, they want larger spaces. Smaller apartments are
glutting the market, and prices for these studio, one- and
two-bedroom apartments are falling disproportionately to
prices for larger places. Thus, the very people who want to
buy larger apartments can't sell their smaller ones. It's a
vicious cycle.
   The result: "There are some very hysterical owners out
there, and on the low end their hysteria is warranted," says
Susan Bird, president of S.W. Bird &amp; Co., a real estate
marketing firm.
   In New York the bind can be especially tight, as co-op
boards often limit an owner's ability to rent the apartment
out. And maintenance fees, ranging from several hundred
dollars to well over $1,000, are due every month whether the
place is occupied or not.
   Cindy Stebbins, who has been trying to sell her
two-bedroom, two-bathroom co-op for a year, paid $312,000 for
it three years ago and invested $60,000 more in renovation. A
real estate broker told her there were 84 apartments for sale
in the neighborhood exactly like hers, with only price to
distinguish among them.
   "The broker said, `Drop your price and you'll get more
traffic,'" Ms. Stebbins says. "So I dropped it, and I still
didn't get any traffic." She says she would now accept
$350,000 -- if no sales commission were involved.
   That probably isn't good enough. A year ago, Lauren
Tarshis and her husband, David Dreyfuss, put their
one-bedroom apartment on the market for $300,000. Ms. Tarshis
says her husband aggressively marketed it, listing it with
100 brokers, placing classified ads in newspapers three days
a week and repeatedly lowering the price. Still, their
efforts aroused only "insultingly low offers that we laughed
off."
   As time passed and Ms. Tarshis found herself unexpectedly
pregnant, the couple began to wonder whether their family
would grow old in a one-bedroom apartment. Finally, last
month, they accepted an offer of $190,000, $35,000 less than
David had paid for the apartment in 1984. Then the building's
co-op board rejected the buyer.
   "The next house we buy will be a commitment," says Ms.
Tarshis. "People are realizing that like a marriage, you have
to try to make a place work."
   The very process of selling a home these days is so
painful that memories of it will surely contribute to the
future stability of the baby boom generation. "I hate having
all those people in my apartment, scoffing at it and saying I
can do better," says Ms. Marx, who would be willing to take a
$20,000 to $30,000 loss on her apartment, but can't even get
that.
   Ms. Stebbins, who owns a decorating business, says the
experience of trying to sell her co-op has been
"psychologically terrible. You think, `Did I do something
wrong? Was I really stupid to invest this much money?' It's
really depressing."
   Most annoying for sellers, especially busy couples with
small children, is keeping the apartment in showroom
condition virtually every day. Ms. Tarshis says it takes an
hour to get their apartment in shape for lookers, and both
she and her husband have tried to avoid the task. "Whoever
left first in the morning would skulk out because the next
person would have to do it," she says.
   Even so, many boomers still think in shorter terms than
their parents. Mark Singer, a writer, recently sold his New
York loft, has a country house on the market and plans to
consolidate his housing in one place in suburban Westchester
County. He chose a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage for the
new house because he felt he couldn't plan much beyond that.
   "We're a nation of economic refugees, and people here move
with some ease," Mr. Singer says. "Our reaction to this move
isn't, `Thank God, at last we're going to settle down.' This
just proves to us that in spite of accumulating three kids
and a lot of other stuff, we can, indeed, move."
