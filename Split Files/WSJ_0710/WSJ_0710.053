   Regulators in the District of Columbia granted Potomac
Electric Power Co. a rate increase of $9.5 million, about
one-fourth of the $38.5 million increase the utility
requested last September.
   The Public Service Commission also cut the Washington
utility's rate of return on equity to 12.35% from 13%.

   The commission said it denied most of Potomac Electric's
requested increase because the company has not been
aggressive enough in encouraging customers to conserve
electricity. The company recently began a five-year program
to encourage conservation through $90 million in customer
rebates and incentives.
   A spokeswoman for the utility said the 1.6% increase is
"totally inadequate to meet the company's needs." The
spokeswoman noted that the commission has ordered rate
decreases of about $50 million since 1984 for tax and other
reasons.
   The rate increase, the company's first since 1984, was
intended to cover "all those costs that have gone up" because
of inflation, the spokeswoman said.
   The company said it will consider its options, including
an appeal, while waiting for the commission's final order,
expected in about two weeks.
