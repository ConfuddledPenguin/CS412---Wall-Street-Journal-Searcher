   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., said it signed a
letter of intent to acquire Western Merchandisers Inc.,
Amarillo, Texas, in exchange for $28 million of Wal-Mart
common stock.
   Under terms of the transaction, Western Merchandisers will
spin off its retail book, music and video businesses
currently handled by a host of companies, including Hastings
Books &amp; Records, into a company named Hastings Books &amp;
Records Inc. The spinoff will leave the rack jobbing, OneStop
and warehouse operations as Western Merchandisers' sole
operations. Wal-Mart said Western Merchandisers will
eventually become a unit.

of retaining their shares in Western Merchandisers and
ultimately exchanging them for Wal-Mart common stock, for
Hastings, or for a combination of the two.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Wal-Mart
rose $1.50 to $32.75.
