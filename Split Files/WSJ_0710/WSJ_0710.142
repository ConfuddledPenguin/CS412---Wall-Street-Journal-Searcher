   WASHINGTON -- Reps. Duncan Hunter and Tom Campbell have
some advice for federal budget negotiators wrestling with new
tax proposals.
   Get the foreigners first.

   Soon after President Bush recanted his no-new-taxes
pledge, the two California Republicans wrote a letter to
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
urging the negotiators "to take a very close look at taxes
owed by foreign-owned businesses before any new revenue
provisions are adopted." Not only are the taxes paid by
foreign-controlled U.S. corporations "unusually low" compared
with their gross receipts, wrote Messrs. Hunter and Campbell,
but the companies are "paying much lower taxes overall than
their foreign counterparts."
   Washington hasn't heard the end of this issue.
   The Government Oversight subcommittee of the House Ways
and Means Committee opens hearings today on whether the
growing number of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations
are paying all the tax they owe the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Commissioner Fred Goldberg will present new figures
showing that in 1987 foreign firms paid taxes on less than 1%
of their gross receipts -- well below the tax levels of
domestic companies. And even more disturbing to many members
of Congress, the IRS figures will show that while sales of
Japanese-owned companies rose nearly 50% in 1987, the
reported income they paid taxes on dropped two-thirds.
   Against the backdrop of painful budget talks and concern
that the U.S. is loosing its competitive standing in the
world, the figures are certain to touch a political nerve.
   "I'm convinced that many foreign companies are in effect
committing fraud," says James Wheeler, an accounting
professor at the University of Michigan and a former IRS
official who is scheduled to testify at the hearings.
   In public and private sessions, subcommittee investigators
plan to present evidence showing that a number of U.S. units
of foreign corporations -- particularly in the automobile,
electronics and motorcycle industries -- are illegally
reducing their taxable income here by paying excessively high
prices to their foreign parents for goods, parts, services
and technology. U.S. tax law says parents must charge the
same prices that subsidiaries would pay on the open market.
   The issue, which has been simmering for several months, is
an alluring one for lawmakers. IRS officials have said that
at least $12 billion is in question in audits of
foreign-controlled U.S. companies. "We want the taxes that
foreign companies owe the United States before we ask the
American people for one more cent," said Rep. Hunter after
writing the letter to budget negotiators.
   Two of the House's most influential members, Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) and Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), have
introduced legislation to strengthen IRS enforcement powers
against foreign companies and for the first time subject
foreigners to a capital-gains tax when they sell stock of
U.S. companies. A companion bill is pending in the Senate.
Given its powerful backers, some people believe the measure
is a strong candidate for inclusion in any budget package
this year.
   Other prominent lawmakers are also raising an eyebrow at
the tax bills of foreign-controlled companies. At a Senate
Finance Committee hearing this spring on the shortfall in
U.S. corporate-tax receipts overall, Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D., Texas) wondered if evasion by foreign-controlled
companies could be partly responsible. His staff is looking
into the issue and he is considering holding hearings on it.
Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has asked the General
Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, to examine
the matter. "Tens of billions of dollars are at stake," Sen.
Helms contended in a speech on the Senate floor recently.
   The issue has spread beyond Washington, too. Rep. Campbell
held a dozen townhall meetings in his Silicon Valley district
over two recent weekends. "This came up at every one," he
says.
   In recent years, the IRS has quietly stepped up its audits
of foreign-controlled companies as more and more foreign
companies have opened operations in the U.S. The tax agency
has also begun turning more attention to U.S. branches of
foreign banks, believing they are improperly allocating
interest costs. In audits of 10 foreign banks last year, the
IRS walked away with an additional $100 million, according to
Donald Houck, the tax agency's deputy assistant commissioner
for international matters.
   But representatives of foreign companies and foreign
governments are making the rounds on Capitol Hill and at the
Treasury to defend themselves. "This is part of an overall
effort that is not good for the American economy," says
Sandra Taylor of the Organization for Fair Treatment of
International Investors, a group of about 30 U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign -- largely European -- companies. She
notes that 90% of member companies' employees are American.
   And some critics charge that Washington's growing
preoccupation with foreign taxpayers is tinged with
xenophobia. They quickly note that the industries the House
subcommittee is focusing on -- electronics, automobiles and
motorcycles -- are dominated world-wide by the Japanese and
contend that the allegations are one more form of
Japan-bashing. U.S. officials respond that they're logically
looking at the industries with the most foreign activity.
"You don't see a whole lot of investigation of nuclear
reactors or airplanes because there aren't a whole lot of
{foreign} nuclear reactors or airplanes sold in the U.S.,"
says Charles Triplett, IRS deputy associate chief counsel for
international matters.
   Nevertheless, some tax practitioners see a clear bias.
"With companies that are foreign-owned, there's a higher
level of investigation, more voluminous document requests,
and I'd say less subjectivity," says Eli Fink, an
international tax partner at the accounting firm Deloitte &amp;
Touche.
   An IRS auditor recently challenged a transaction between
one of Mr. Fink's clients, a U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese
company, and a separate Japanese company. subject to higher
tax because it was between two related companies.
   "We said we were not related to that company," Mr. Fink
says. "But the agent wrote in his report that we know all
Japanese companies are interrelated."
   Concern over whether foreign-controlled U.S. companies are
paying their fair share of U.S. tax was triggered several
months ago by 1986 IRS statistics, the most recent available
at the time, showing gross receipts of foreign companies
filing tax returns in the U.S. totaled $543 billion that year
while their taxable income amounted to a negative $1.5
billion.
   But 1986 was the only recent year that overall taxable
income was negative. The Organization for Fair Treatment of
International Investors hired the accounting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick to study the issue. It concluded that a plunge in the
value of the dollar that year drove up the costs of
foreign-owned companies and consequently decreased their
income.
   The report also says that from 1983 through 1986 the
average effective tax rate for foreign-owned companies in the
U.S. was slightly higher than that for U.S. companies if
measured as a percent of assets or net worth. Statistics for
1987 show net income of foreign-controlled companies jumped
to more than $5 billion.
   Whether people believe foreign-controlled companies are
attempting tax evasion or not, many will argue in the
hearings that the IRS needs more powers to find out.
