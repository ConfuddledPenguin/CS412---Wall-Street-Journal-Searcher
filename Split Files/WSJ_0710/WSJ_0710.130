   WASHINGTON -- Sen. Howard Metzenbaum said he may seek to
subpoena one of President Bush's former aides, who as a
lobbyist helped an Arizona insurance executive buy 15 Texas
thrifts even though his bid was apparently $97 million more
expensive to the government than a competitor's.
   The Ohio Democrat, who is conducting an inquiry into the
government's December 1988 sale of the insolvent savings and
loan associations to James Fail, said he will ask the Senate
Judiciary Committee to subpoena Robert Thompson if he won't
testify voluntarily.

   Mr. Thompson was an aide to George Bush when he was vice
president. After leaving Mr. Bush's staff, Mr. Thompson wrote
to Danny Wall, then the head of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, urging consideration of Mr. Fail's offer for the S&amp;Ls.
   Sen. Metzenbaum also said he may seek a subpoena for the
testimony of I.C.H. Corp. Chairman Robert Shaw. Sen.
Metzenbaum said at a hearing that Mr. Shaw arranged for
Chicago-based Bankers Life Insurance Co., a unit of I.C.H.,
to loan $35 million to Mr. Fail to back the purchase of the
thrifts, which Mr. Fail consolidated and now runs as
Bluebonnet Savings Bank.
   The senator said documents obtained by investigators on
his staff suggest that Mr. Shaw personally received the right
to 50% of the profits or ownership of Dallas-based
Bluebonnet, although the loans were made by Bankers Life.
   In testimony before the senator's Judiciary subcommittee,
Zack Stamp, the top insurance regulator for the state of
Illinois, wouldn't discuss details of his agency's inquiry
into the matter. However, he said there was "the likelihood
of an administrative or criminal action out of the
information {subcommittee investigators} gave us."
   Mr. Stamp didn't elaborate, but said it was a violation of
Illinois regulations for officers of insurance companies to
engage in activities that would benefit themselves without
reporting such activities to state regulators. A spokesman
for I.C.H., an insurance-holding company based in Louisville,
Ky., didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.
   A lawyer for both Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson denounced Sen.
Metzenbaum's inquiry as "motivated by sheer political
opportunism" and questioned whether the senator's
subcommittee had the jurisdiction to look into S&amp;L matters.
Another spokesman for Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson said no
decision had been made on whether the two men will testify
voluntarily.
   Sen. Metzenbaum said he hopes the committee will issue
subpoenas within a week if the two men refuse to testify.
   Mr. Wall, the former Bank Board chairman who oversaw the
sale of the thrifts, said, "there was no political pressure
whatsoever" from Mr. Thompson. In fact, Mr. Wall said, he
knew Weston Edwards, the businessman whose bid was apparently
$97 million cheaper for the government, "better than I knew
Thompson." Mr. Wall said the Bank Board staff recommended Mr.
Fail's bid and "that's what the full board -- two Republicans
and a Democrat -- approved."
   Sen. Metzenbaum said Mr. Wall had declined to testify at
yesterday's hearing. Mr. Wall said he had been invited only
last week, and that he would testify if given enough time to
prepare.
   Sen. Metzenbaum has criticized the sale of the 15 thrifts
as a giveaway in which Mr. Fail put up only $1,000 of his own
money and borrowed $70 million, while the U.S. pledged $1.85
billion in assistance.
   But Stanley Brand, the attorney for Messrs. Fail and
Thompson, said Mr. Fail also "pledged virtually all his
holdings as collateral . . . {It} is ludicrous and unfair to
pretend that he does not have a substantial stake in the
well-being of these institutions."
   Separately, Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby,
said that people associated with Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association, Beverly Hills, Calif., gave a total of $284,900
in campaign contributions to political candidates and party
committees from January 1981 through April 1990.
   Last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision filed
administrative charges against Thomas Spiegel, former chief
executive of the thrift, alleging he spent several million
dollars of thrift funds on personal expenses. The thrift
office is seeking a record $24 million in fines and
restitution from Mr. Spiegel, who has denied any wrongdoing.
   Common Cause said that federal filings show Mr. Spiegel
made a $100,000 "soft money" contribution benefiting
President Bush's 1988 campaign. Soft money contributions are
given to political parties and aren't subject to limits of
the federal election laws.
   The Common Cause study showed that Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) led
congressional recipients of donations from Columbia
officials, their spouses, and Columbia's political action
committee during the period with $29,000. Utah Sen. Jake
Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, was second with
$25,200.
   Sen. Metzenbaum was seventh with $11,000. Sen. Metzenbaum
said at yesterday's hearing, "I raised eight or nine million
dollars for my last campaign. Columbia clearly didn't buy a
friend of the savings-and-loan industry in me."
