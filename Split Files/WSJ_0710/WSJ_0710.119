   GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.,
the world's largest package-delivery company, agreed to buy
as much as 17.4% of fast-growing Mail Boxes Etc. Inc., San
Diego.
   A spokesman for closely held UPS said the company "derives
a substantial amount of business" from Mail Boxes Etc. and
similar companies. Mail Boxes Etc., targeting particularly
small businesses, operates a chain of franchised storefronts
offering services including post boxes, phone answering,
faxing, copying and funds transfer by wire.

   In turn, Mail Boxes Etc. franchisees derive 40% to 50% of
their total revenue by acting as drop-off points for
customers who want UPS to deliver their packages, said A.W.
DeSio, Mail Boxes Etc.'s vice chairman and chief executive
officer. The franchisees also can take drop-offs for UPS
competitors.
   UPS agreed to pay $25.25 for each of 400,000 shares of
Mail Boxes Etc., a total $10.1 million. UPS also would buy
400,000 warrants, each exercisable into one Mail Boxes Etc.
share, for about $1.2 million, or $2.92 apiece. UPS can
exercise the warrants over three years at prices of $27 to
$38.88 a share; if it exercises the warrants it would hold
17.4% of Mail Boxes Etc.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mail Boxes
Etc. shares jumped $3 to $25.
   The agreement, subject to UPS doing a due-diligence review
of Mail Boxes Etc.'s operations and a definitive agreement,
also allows UPS to boost its stake to as much as 35% after
one year. UPS would get a seat on Mail Boxes Etc.'s board,
which currently has seven members.
   The agreement will provide capital for Mail Boxes Etc.'s
growth; it has been adding about one new outlet a day for the
past year, Mr. DeSio said. The company has issued licenses to
franchise its name, trademarks and system in Canada and
Japan.
   "UPS has done nothing in {its} ground system and little in
the air system on their own to facilitate retail access to
their" services, said Paul Schlesinger of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. The pact with Mail Boxes Etc. might
be "a means of exercising some influence" over a network of
drop-off centers for the infrequent, retail user of package
delivery.
   In March, Mail Boxes Etc. agreed to act as agent
exclusively for DHL Worldwide Express for domestic and
international overnight package delivery. That agreement,
which runs for a year, won't be affected.
