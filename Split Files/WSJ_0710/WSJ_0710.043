   Stuttgart, West Germany -- It is easy to think Romantic
German thoughts, standing in front of this city's sturdy old
opera house and facing the Schlossgarten, with its lovely
lake and plump swans swimming on it. But it was hardly to
glimpse a descendant of Lohengrin's pet that one Japanese
music student made a five-hour train trip from Cologne three
days in a row to join the ranks of hundreds of other
fashionable young opera-goers clamoring for tickets. Opera
has never been more in vogue with the European young -- in
England, Pavarotti has nearly topped the pop charts with a
Puccini aria -- but it is not that popular. Unless it is
written by Philip Glass. And the Stuttgart Opera is the
center of this American minimalist's cult.
   During most of the '80s, Stuttgart's music director was
the American conductor and Glass champion Dennis Russell
Davies. Not only did the company originate the finest
productions anywhere of Mr. Glass's best-known operas,
"Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten," it has kept them in repertoire.
Two seasons ago, Stuttgart mounted Mr. Glass's experimental
first opera, "Einstein on the Beach," for the first time; and
last month it finally staged Mr. Glass's three "portrait"
operas, written between 1976 and '84, as a "Ring"-like cycle
over three nights.

   It was an extraordinary theatrical event. Even the long
ovations were serious drama. And anyone trying to squeeze out
of the narrow aisles before the cheering ended faced angry
scowls and locked knees.
   Evidently, the trilogy not only has survived but thrived
here through radical reinterpretation. As staged by Achim
Freyer, the visionary German painter, designer and director,
the operas -- which portray three great figures of history
who profoundly affected politics, religion and science --
were produced in versions different from anything the
composer had ever imagined for his works.
   Indeed, Mr. Glass has said that the first time he saw Mr.
Freyer's 1981 production of "Satyagraha," the opera about
Gandhi's South African years and his nonviolent movement, he
was so startled he didn't know what to think.
   Mr. Freyer stages opera like a painter, applying his own
imagery and symbolism to the work without always referring
directly to the libretto. Thus "Satyagraha" begins with a
Teutonic kind of tableau, an updated nightmare out of Bosch,
including a car wreck, a fat lady, and a prostitute
performing a manicure on a corpse. A lovely pastoral scene
later on populated by figures of Shiva, an elephant, and an
Indian woman playing with an electric yo-yo, is broken up by
fascist bikers. Mr. Freyer requires three Gandhis: one sings,
one dances, one acts.
   Similarly, Stuttgart's "Akhnaten" is Mr. Freyer's
opulently imaginative view of the Egyptian pharaoh who was
history's first monotheist. At times it is so overwhelmingly
beautiful that its images attach themselves irrevocably to
the music. In what is probably Mr. Freyer's most famous stage
picture, he delicately suspends the pharaoh and his six
daughters in a circle, as if hung like a picture, and bathes
them in golden light.
   Downright inexplicable, however, was Mr. Freyer's vision
of "Einstein on the Beach." Unlike Mr. Glass's later operas,
"Einstein" is not traditional opera but an original kind of
music theater jointly devised, in its original form, by Mr.
Glass and the American theater artist Robert Wilson. The work
itself has no pertinent sung text, and the great scientist's
life is represented through Mr. Wilson's hauntingly romantic
stage imagery -- a train, a bed, a trial scene, a spaceship
and the figure of Einstein himself playing the violin -- all
of it exuberantly propelled by Mr. Glass's repetitive music.
   While the Stuttgart version credited "Einstein" to Messrs.
Glass and Wilson, Mr. Wilson's contribution was otherwise
wiped out by Mr. Freyer, who chose to stage the four-hour
work mostly with abstract shapes floating behind a grid. But
gone as well was the visual and intellectual vitality of Mr.
Freyer's earlier stagings.
   Mr. Freyer ended the other two operas with touching, very
beautiful visions of starry nights, while Mr. Glass's
gorgeous arpeggios drifted effectively into limitless space.
The result was a profound release of tension. So it may be
that with the visual flotsam of his "Einstein" Mr. Freyer was
hoping to make a cosmic statement about the disintegration of
the world. There was, though, something ineffably poignant
about watching a few colored flakes float to the ground
during what was originally the opera's climactic spaceship
scene, set to some of the most ebullient music Mr. Glass has
ever written.
   Still, Mr. Freyer's dispiriting ending to the trilogy
scarcely diminished the effectiveness of the works overall,
especially since they were given splendid performances. Mr.
Davies now conducts in Bonn, so "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten"
were entrusted to Christopher Keene, who had previously
conducted inferior productions of the two operas in the U.S.
This time Mr. Keene shone, inducing a rapt atmosphere
throughout. He seems to have come into his own as a conductor
at last, a good thing for the New York City Opera, which he
has just taken over. Mr. Keene also inspired the best from
his generally distinguished casts. Gandhi was the tenor Leo
Goeke; Akhnaten was the countertenor Paul Esswood. Both have
lived long with their roles and are fervent interpreters. As
for "Einstein," Michael Riesman conducted his specially
trained German players in a riveting performance that
challenged the precision even of Mr. Glass's own ensemble.
   If Mr. Wilson felt slighted over the "Einstein" business,
he can hardly complain about his treatment throughout the
rest of Germany, where his work is far better represented
than in his native America. Lately he has had four major
productions throughout Germany, and it was still possible to
see two of them in the days preceding the Glass trilogy. In
Frankfurt, Mr. Wilson staged a wondrously lit, minimalist
"King Lear" that at times seemed to produce the mysticism of
a Mark Rothko color-field painting brought to life. It was
perhaps Mr. Wilson's greatest innovation to treat "Lear" as
if it were almost a passion play, with the Lear, German
actress Marianne Hoppe, turned into a moving symbol of
dignity and resignation in death, amid the madness of the
world around her.
   At the other extreme was Mr. Wilson's delightfully
outlandish "The Black Rider," which was created for the
Thalia Theater in Hamburg and that had moved on to the Vienna
Festival. Collaborating with the mordant American songwriter
Tom Waits and the author William Burroughs, Mr. Wilson has
produced an inspired new version of the story upon which
Weber's opera, "Der Freischutz" is based. Each of Mr. Waits's
songs becomes an extravagant production number, in which Mr.
Wilson moves effortlessly between the ghoulishly grotesque
and the ethereal.
   Sadly little of such vital work going on throughout
Germany will likely reach America. "The Black Rider,"
however, may reach the Brooklyn Academy of Music next spring,
and Mr. Freyer's designs for a production of Schoenberg's
"Moses und Aron" will be used at New York City Opera in the
fall. Otherwise you might sample Mr. Freyer's own peculiar
and quite wonderful notions about "Der Freischutz" in the
Stuttgart Opera's production of the Weber opera available on
a Home Vision videotape.
