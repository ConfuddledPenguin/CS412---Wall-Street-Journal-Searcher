   Good Guys Inc., citing new-store sales and strong sales in
all product categories, said its third-quarter sales
increased 56%.

compared with $41.9 million a year earlier, Good Guys said.
The consumer electronics retailer said it will release
earnings figures later this month.

   The San Francisco company said the increase came, in part,
from six new stores added this year, which brought its total
stores to 23 as of June 30 from 17 stores at the end of June
1989. Comparable store sales -- sales at stores in operation
for more than a year -- were up 29% in the period, the
company said.
   Sales growth has been strong across the board in all
products since last summer, said a Good Guys spokesman. For
the first nine months of its 1990 fiscal year, Good Guys
said, sales increased 51% to $215.1 million from $142.9
million. Comparable store sales for the nine months rose 26%.
