   Peugeot S.A. Chairman Jacques Calvet said in Paris that
the car maker would be satisfied if its 1990 earnings show
little change or even a slight decline from the 10.30 billion
francs ($1.86 billion) earned in 1989 after payments to
minority interests.
   Mr. Calvet's statement, made to journalists, reiterated
caution he voiced at the group's annual meeting two weeks
ago, when he said he wouldn't be disappointed if consolidated
cash flow for all of 1990 matched the 1989 total of 18.53
billion francs. He extended that caution to net profit,
saying that a stable 1990 result would be "satisfactory."

   The main uncertainty facing the sector this year has been
concern about a demand slowdown after several years of brisk
European sales that reached a record in 1989. Mr. Calvet was
calm on this front, predicting that French car demand would
rise 4% to 5% this year. He also reiterated his forecast that
the European market would be little changed or even slightly
higher than its 1989 performance.
