   Fuels re-exports, which more than doubled on the year,
were the top growth category among goods transshipped through
Hong Kong.
   Domestic exports of clothing and textiles, the largest
local export sector, edged down 4% and 2% respectively, from
the previous year. Radios, which plummeted 44%, and domestic
electrical appliances, which plunged 36%, were the export
sectors hardest hit by the downturn.
