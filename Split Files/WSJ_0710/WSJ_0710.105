   WASHINGTON -- The federal government proposed
hazardous-waste cleanup standards that would impose heavy
costs on chemical and other companies but generally spur
brisk growth among treatment and disposal companies.
   The standards, proposed by the Environmental Protection
Agency, spell out procedures for decontaminating waste
generated routinely during manufacturing or resulting from
accidents or spills. The agency put the cost to private
industry at between $7 billion and $42 billion over 20 years,
with the biggest impact falling on chemical companies,
petroleum refiners, wood preservers, metal finishers and auto
manufacturers.

   The new rules, called "corrective action" rules, would
affect 3,000 to 4,000 operating facilities, including several
hundred owned by the federal government. They would result in
a cleanup effort bigger than the federal Superfund program,
which is designed to clean up abandoned waste sites.
Currently, the agency has no comprehensive standards for
cleaning up hazardous wastes at sites that haven't been
abandoned.
   Much of the cleanup business resulting from the proposed
rules probably would go to companies such as Chemical Waste
Management, International Technology Corp. and Canonie
Environmental Services Corp., according to Debra Coy,
environmental analyst at Washington Analysis Corp., a
research arm of County NatWest Securities. "My sense is there
is some pent-up demand out there that should be released,"
she said.
   EPA officials and private analysts predicted that the
rules, along with other federal actions tightening cleanup
and permit requirements over the past few years, would force
marginally profitable polluters and cleanup companies out of
business. The EPA said industries that may have a rough time
complying include the sanitation services, coatings and
engravings and wood products industries.
   The new standards would address treatment, storage or
disposal of hazardous wastes by any company that has such
wastes on hand for 90 days or more. Don Clay, an assistant
EPA administrator, said a growing number of companies would
be covered because more and more substances are considered
toxic.
   The cost of cleaning federal sites, which mostly are owned
by the Energy and Defense departments, would range from $3
billion to $18 billlion.
   The rules aren't likely to become final for a couple of
years, largely because the White House Budget Office, which
held up the rules for two years, is requiring the agency to
develop more precise estimates of the projected costs. The
environmental agency also plans to hold hearings and consider
public comments on the proposal.
   But release of the proposal is expected to get work
started at a variety of facilities where companies have been
waiting to get a sense of what form the regulations would
take.
   The EPA, under its existing authority, has imposed cleanup
requirements at more than 600 facilities. Mr. Clay said the
proposal aims to standardize rules and procedures while
expediting cleanups. In some cases, requirements are designed
to deal with existing environmental hazards; in other cases
they are meant to prevent potential future threats, he said.
