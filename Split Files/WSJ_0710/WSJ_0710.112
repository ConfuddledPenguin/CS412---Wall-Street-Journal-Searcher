   CyCare Systems Inc. said it will take about $21 million in
write-downs during the second quarter, reflecting the
discontinuation of certain product lines and other factors.
   In the year-earlier period, the supplier of
data-processing services for the health-care industry posted
net income of $791,000, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of
$22.4 million.

   CyCare said the write-downs have been spurred by a change
in the company's strategic direction. The Phoenix, Ariz.,
company will now concentrate on supplying doctors in group
practice.
   "The adjustments due to this strategic redirection of the
corporation mark the end of an intensive review process, and
allows us to continue to move forward toward accomplishing
our goals of stable revenue and earnings growth," said Jim
Houtz, CyCare's chairman and chief executive officer.
