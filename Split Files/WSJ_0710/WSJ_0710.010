   CLINTON, N.J. -- Foster Wheeler Corp. said its French
subsidiary was awarded a contract to design and build a new
plant for Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. that will
produce synthetic human insulin, called humulin.
   The new facility, which is expected to cost most of the
$115 million that Lilly has budgeted for expenditure in
France, will be located near Lilly's existing plant in
Fergersheim, near Strasbourg. The plant's start-up is slated
for 1993.
