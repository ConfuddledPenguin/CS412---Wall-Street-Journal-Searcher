   LAKE WORTH, Fla. -- Martin W. Taplin, a real estate
workout specialist and president of Martin W. Taplin
Associates, was named chairman of Cenvill Development Corp.,
filling a vacancy.
   Cenvill, a real estate development company, is 96%-owned
by First American Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Lake Worth and came
under control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. when the
bank was seized by regulators last year.

   The three new directors succeed Richard O'Brien, Kathryn
