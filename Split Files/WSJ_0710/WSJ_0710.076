   NEW YORK -- Continued fallout from Friday's employment
report and caution ahead of today's $5 billion sale of
"bailout bonds" bruised bond prices.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 1/2
point yesterday, or $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of
its price, rose to 8.54%.

   The loss followed a sharp 1 1/8-point decline on Friday,
which was triggered by the Department of Labor's employment
report. Although jobs growth was sluggish in June, investors
were frustrated because the report overall wasn't weak enough
to prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy anytime
soon. Many investors bet heavily that the report would show
substantial weakness in the economy.
   "The employment report was a big disappointment," said
Lacy Hunt, economist at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc. He
said that investors sold bonds actively during the morning
session, but that the market remained extremely quiet for the
remainder of the day with very little trading taking place.
There was very little reaction later in the day to the
government's report of stronger-than-expected expansion of
consumer credit.
   In addition to economic concerns, analysts said investors
were a bit jittery ahead of today's planned $5 billion sale
of 30-year bonds by the Resolution Funding Corp. Refcorp is
the federal agency responsible for raising money to finance
the nation's thrift industry bailout.
   Today's auction will be Refcorp's fourth and will mark the
agency's return to issuing 30-year bonds after selling
40-year bonds in January and April. The previous two 40-year
Refcorp auctions were considered disasters on the day of the
sales and sparked sharp sell-offs in the broader bond market.
However, demand for the securities picked up later when the
bonds were "stripped." Strips are created when dealers
separate the interest-paying "coupon" portion of the a bond
from its principal or "corpus" portion and sell the two parts
separately. Strips also are divided into different
maturities.
   "Refcorp is a very difficult issue," said Mr. Hunt. "It's
a different type of animal and there is some concern," about
how it will fare.
   In when-issued trading activity, yields on the Refcorp
bailout bonds were quoted late yesterday at 8.93%. On July 3,
the day that Refcorp when-issued trading began, the 30-year
bonds were quoted at yields of 8.81%, 0.40 percentage point
higher than yields on the 30-year Treasury bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The government sold a record $18 billion of Treasury bills
yesterday at rates that were much higher than at the previous
auction a week earlier.
   The average discount rate on threemonth bills was 7.81%,
up from 7.73% at last week's auction. The rate on six-month
bills was 7.75%, up from 7.60% last week.
   Traders said the average rate for three-month bills at
yesterday's auction was the highest since the average of
7.91% at the auction on April 30, while the average rate on
six month bills was the highest since 7.79% at the May 21
auction.
   In trading yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond ended at a price of 102 4/32 to yield 8.54% compared
with 102 18/32 to yield 8.50% on Friday. The latest 10-year
notes ended at 102 to yield 8.55% compared with 102 10/32 to
yield 8.50%.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated July 12. The 13-week bills mature

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   In a report on the global bond markets titled "Sterling
Crowned Queen of the Quarter," Salomon Brothers Inc. said the
British bond market outperformed other foreign markets during
the second quarter.
   The report said that British bonds, which are called
gilts, reversed exceptionally weak performance in the first
quarter to post a total return of 7.14%, when measured in
sterling. When measured in U.S. dollars, the gilts market
rose 13.78%, Salomon said.
   Yields on 10-year gilts fell one full percentage point
during the second quarter, due largely to a 6.20% gain in the
value of sterling.
   In U.S. dollar terms, the other top-performing markets
were Switzerland, 9.77%; Australia, 8.89%; Japan, 6.75% and
Denmark 6.18%. The worst performers were West Germany, 3.41%;
Netherlands, 3.53%; France, 4.47% and Canada 5.04%.
   But gilts weren't winners yesterday. Traders said the
market ended weaker despite another surge in sterling and a
smaller-than-expected rise in wholesale prices.
   Traders attributed the drop in gilts mostly to technical
factors, including the September long-term gilt futures
contract's move below a key support level.
   Among benchmark gilts, the 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell
nearly 1/2 point to 100 15/32 to yield 11.68% while 12% notes
due 1995 fell 3/8 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.35%. (These yields
are quoted in local terms and therefore differ somewhat from
yields calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms,
which tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare
yields across markets.)
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bucking the trend in the broader bond market, junk bonds
ended slightly firmer yesterday. Most junk bonds, high-yield
speculative grade securities that have low credit ratings or
no credit ratings at all, ended between 1/8 and 1/4 point
higher.
   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. led the market. The
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco posted gains on reports that
the company was deluged with $7 billion in loan commitments
from banks for its debt refinancing plan. Pay-in-kind bonds
pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   The food and tobacco concern plans to use $2.25 billion in
bank loans to help buy back some of its most troublesome
high-yield issues, the pay-in-kind bonds that must be reset
to trade at par by next April.
   The company's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures
due in 2009 finished 7/8 point higher to close at 104 1/2 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures maturing in 2007 ended 5/8 point lower
to close at 85 5/8.
   Prices of investment grade bonds fell between 1/8 and 3/8
point.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities

   Mortgage securities prices continued their recent slide on
the heels of the Treasury market, although losses in mortgage
securities were less pronounced.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 10% issues were down 6/32 at
101 11/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities
were down 5/32 at 98 11/32 and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were off 5/32 at 98 27/ 32.
   In the primary market for mortgage-backed securities,
pricing details were announced for three real estate mortgage
investment conduits now being traded,for a total of $1.3
billion.
   A $500 million issue of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Remics is being offered by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
The offering is backed by Freddie Mac 9.5% securities.
   A $400 million issue of Federal National Mortgage
Association Remics is being offered by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% securities.
   And a $400 million Remic issue from Denver-based Fund
America Investors Corp. is being backed by Ginnie Mae 10%
securities and offered by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.
   In new issue activity, a First Southwest Co. group set the
preliminary pricing for an issue of $50 million Texas
zero-coupon college student loan bonds.
   The bonds were priced to yield to maturity from 6.20% in
1992 to 7.25% in 2006 to 2009.
   This week more than $2 billion in new issues are scheduled
to be priced.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8 point at 98 5/8 to
yield 7.30%.
