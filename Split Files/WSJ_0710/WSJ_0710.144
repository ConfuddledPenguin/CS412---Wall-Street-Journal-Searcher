   WASHINGTON -- Boosted by a strong increase in retail and
bank card borrowing, consumer credit grew at a 6.5% annual
rate in May, the Federal Reserve Board said.
   Credit owed by consumers, generally all forms of personal
debt excluding mortgages, rose $3.91 billion in May, the
largest increase since October of last year when consumer
debt climbed $4.43 billion, the Fed said.

   The May rise follows a weak increase of $390 million in
April, or an annual rate of 0.6%. The April figures were
lowered from a 1.0% increase, or $584 million.
   Showing the biggest increase, revolving credit, mainly
retail and bank card debt, rose $3.13 billion in May,
amounting to an annual growth rate of 18.5%. The May increase
comes after a rise at a 10.1% annual rate one month before.
   Despite May's significant growth, some analysts said
consumer attitudes on borrowing remain the same.
   "I don't think this month's {May's} increase is enough to
say anything has changed," said David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association here. "If you look at the
average over the past five months, the average is $1.6
billion per month . . . consumer borrowing has slowed, not
increased since last year."
   Nevertheless, Mr. Berson said he found the latest figures
to be encouraging because they show that consumer borrowing
is appropriate for the current expansion rate of the economy.
   "Since we are very close to full employment . . . the
economy needs to grow a little less slowly to fight
inflation," he said. "Too much borrowing now would almost
certainly lead to inflation."
   Automobile credit was still weak in May, falling $87
million, at a 0.4% annual rate, following an April decline of
$1.99 billion, or at an annual rate of 8.2%.
