   Three shareholders of Mack Trucks Inc. filed a lawsuit
alleging that the proposed $99-million buy-out of the company
by Renault Vehicules Industriels is unfair.
   Renault, a unit of state-owned Regie Nationale des Usines
Renault, announced earlier that it plans to start a
$6-a-share tender offer Thursday for the 55% of Mack it
doesn't own. Filed in federal court in Philadelphia, the suit
alleges that an announcement of Mack's poor financial outlook
on the same day was an effort "to lull {investors} into
having a belief that the most that they were entitled to" was
the Renault offer.

   The suit, which names Mack and Renault as defendants, asks
the court to order Renault to divest itself of any benefits
it may obtain from the alleged scheme. It seeks class-action
status. The plaintiffs are Barbara Zarowitz, Lepow Equities
and Peter Stuyvesant Ltd.
   A spokesman for Mack, based in Allentown, Pa., declined to
comment on the suit. Renault, based in Paris, couldn't be
reached for comment last evening.
