   No, Joe Morgenstern did not see newsreels of the Flying
Tigers shooting down Japanese Zeros when he was a boy
("Classic Planes on the Block," Leisure &amp; Arts, June 22.) He
has been victimized by two of the lesser myths of World War
II.
   The Tigers were mercenaries who flew for China in the
opening months of the war, and they had no newsreel cameramen
in their train. In July 1942, the American Volunteer Group
(as it was officially known) was replaced by U.S. Army
squadrons, but only five Tigers agreed to stay on. Largely to
hide this embarrassment, the military extended their fighting
name to the Army men who took over their planes.

   Then, too, the Mitsubishi Zero-Sen was a Japanese navy
plane. The Tigers fought over Burma and China -- the province
of the Japanese army, which was equipped with an entirely
different set of planes.
   Incidentally, the U.S. bought back the AVG P-40s for
$65,000 each. When they read that a Warhawk sells today for
$750,000, the Chinese will be sorry they didn't keep them.
