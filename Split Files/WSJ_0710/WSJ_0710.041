   MORE FRENCH GIVE UP WINE

   Most French people say they never drink wine, according to
a study by a French wine-industry organization.
   The nationwide survey of 4,000 people was conducted in
March and April by the National Interprofessional Office of
Wine. Participants were asked about the drinking habits of
all adults in their household, and the responses reflected
the practices of 12,400 people, the organization said. In a
1980 survey conducted by the group, 38.7% of the respondents
said they never drink wine. That figure climbed to 45.1% in
1985 and to 50.7% this year.
   Wine consumption varies sharply by sex, according to the
survey. It said 10.9% of the women and 28.1% of the men
called themselves daily wine drinkers.
   Asked why they didn't drink wine, 73.4% of the respondents
said they didn't like it and 25.3% cited health concerns. The
beverage most often chosen to replace wine with meals was
water.
                                                                                                       

   ROBBERY IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   A 15-man team of bank robbers may become the latest
contributor to Brazilian inflation. The robbers stole
cruzeiros valued at more than $13 million Sunday morning from
a federal Central Bank branch in Salvador, Bahia. Most of the
stolen cash reserves hadn't yet become part of the money
supply. The Central Bank said it would publish a listing of
all the serial numbers today, but this may not prevent the
banknotes -- believed to be in small denominations -- from
circulating. Central Bank officials told the Jornal do Brasil
newspaper that the heist was "as if the thieves were issuing
currency."

   JAPAN'S COMMUNISTS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Communist Party opened a congress yesterday with
an attack on China and the Soviet Union. The party, which has
500,000 members, has long tried to distance itself from the
two giants of world communism by advocating multiparty
democracy. However, its support has fallen sharply in two
national elections over the past year in part because of
public revulsion at China's repression of democracy protests
and the anti-communist tide of change in Europe.
                                                                                                       

   TOWARD PEACE IN AFRICA
                                                                                                       

   The six countries of the Horn of Africa agreed to help
each other find peace. The leaders of Ethiopia, Uganda,
Kenya, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti made their pledge just
before the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity
opened yesterday in Addis Ababa. Each country promised to
"refrain from any action against the national unity and
territorial integrity of other member states." Of the six
nations, only Kenya and Djibouti are free from civil war.
                                                                                                       

   PLANS FOR EAST GERMAN AIRLINE
                                                                                                       

   West Germany plans to reduce state ownership of the East
German airline Interflug to 51% from 100% following the full
unification of the two Germanys, Lufthansa said. That would
leave Lufthansa, West Germany's 51% state-owned flag carrier,
with its previously agreed upon 26% stake in Interflug, with
the other 23% being sold to third parties, Lufthansa Chairman
Heinz Ruhnau said. He didn't identify the third parties.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S FALTERING ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   China released figures for 1990's first six months that
showed poor performance by state-owned industry. Finance
Minister Wang Bingqian characterized the nation's financial
situation as "still fairly grim," the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. Xinhua quoted Mr. Wang as blaming China's
economic woes on low industrial production, a sluggish market
and insufficient control over expenditures.
                                                                                                       

   GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR EAST EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union and its East European neighbors are
plunging deeper into recession, United Nations economists
said.
   Some radical austerity policies, particularly in Poland,
have led to worse recession than expected, the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe said. And attempts by the Soviet Union
and some other countries to stabilize activity within the old
communist-style economic system have generally failed.
   The commission said East European governments had
encountered considerable difficulties in obtaining a
consensus for new solutions. "The policy landscape at midyear
is thus dominated by uncertainty. The only certain element
appears to be that the recession in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union is far from having run its course," it said in a
midyear review of the economies of its 34 member states.
   "The problems facing the reforming economies are immense,"
the commission said, "and their solution will take time and
require considerable assistance from the West."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co. has replaced disposable
wooden chop sticks with reusable plastic ones in the company
cafeteria. In so doing, "we are helping to preserve forests
and reduce urban waste," a spokesman said. . . . Britain will
hold an inquiry into the conduct of a steamship captain who
was censured for not helping the Titanic when it sank 78
years ago. The investigation will examine testimony at the
original inquiry as to the role of Stanley Lord, captain of
the Californian. The new inquiry comes in response to a
campaign by relatives to clear the name of Mr. Lord, who
maintained until his death in 1962 that he was too far from
the Titanic to be of help.
