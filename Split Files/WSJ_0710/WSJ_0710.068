   To save money, the U.S. Postal Service says it will
contract out to private companies some of its letter-sorting
work. The postal union workers' leader says this is a
"disgrace" and vows to "fight it on the beaches, on the hill,
in negotiations, wherever." Moscow may have a private postal
system before it reaches the public backwaters of the U.S.
