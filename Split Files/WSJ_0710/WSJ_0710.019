   The Life-Insurance Quandary:
   How Much Is Really Enough?

   How much life insurance do you need?
   Many people have either too little or too much, financial
advisers say. But the specialists frequently disagree on just
how much is enough.

   Anyone who consults two or more experts may be tempted to
give up in disgust: Asked by The Wall Street Journal to
evaluate the life-insurance needs of a hypothetical
45-year-old corporate manager, 10 advisers and insurance
sellers gave suggestions that ranged from as little as
$250,000 to as much as $1,250,000.
   But the risk of leaving loved ones in financial peril is
too great to simply shelve the whole question. And
thankfully, deciding how much life insurance to carry doesn't
have to be as frustrating as it first seems.
   The key is to accept that there isn't a magic number.
"It's a bit naive to think there's one right answer. But
there probably is a correct range" of coverage for each
person, says George E.L. Barbee, executive director of
personal financial services for accountants Price Waterhouse.
   A reasonable game plan: Try a few methods to estimate
insurance needs. Scrutinize and vary the assumptions used.
Weigh the costs of different amounts of coverage. Then settle
on a figure that feels right. Any thoughtful decision will
probably be better than no decision at all.
   The goal is to provide money your dependents can tap
immediately and over the years if you should die tomorrow.
Don't worry if you can't figure out what it will cost to send
your daughter to college in 2003, or that your spouse's ideas
about retirement could change several times before 2014.
   Use the best information you have now. And keep in mind
that insurance coverage can -- and should -- be modified as
family circumstances change. "We see so often that even one
year later so many things have changed," says Robert DeValle,
a Palo Alto, Calif., insurance agent.
   There are always trade-offs. A large policy could assure
one's children the financial wherewithal to go to Harvard.
But "you're spending a lot of money for the premiums that
could have been used for some other purposes" -- such as
saving to finance family goals in the event breadwinners live
for decades, says Tim Kochis, national director of personal
financial planning for accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   The simplest approach is to use an old rule of thumb that
life-insurance coverage should equal five to seven times --
some say as much as 10 times -- a person's annual salary.
"The multiples appeal to me because they're easy to use,"
says James H. Hunt, an actuary and director of the National
Insurance Consumer Organization, Alexandria, Va.
   Unfortunately, the multiples provide only ballpark
figures, which may be totally inappropriate for a particular
family's needs and goals. For instance, single people
generally don't need life insurance, while the primary
breadwinner in a family with young children may need tons.
   A modified version of the multiples approach is contained
in the accompanying table, which was prepared at the
Journal's request by insurer Principal Financial Group, Des
Moines, Iowa. It's essentially a worst-case calculation of
how much life insurance would be needed to replace 75% of a
person's take-home pay if there were no other income for the
survivors. Social Security benefits, a surviving spouse's
salary and investment earnings, among other things, would
lower the insurance need.
   Principal Financial Group itself prefers that its agents
use a detailed computer-aided analysis to weigh a family's
financial resources against the sums the survivors are likely
to need. This is a standard approach for many insurance
agents and financial planners.
   Computer-assisted recommendations aren't without flaws,
however. While they can be highly personalized, they are
dependent on the numerous assumptions and projections plugged
into the computer. Change one variable and you can change the
bottom line greatly.
   Individuals can do an abbreviated version of the analysis,
without a computer, by using a worksheet like the one printed
near the end of this article. (See accompanying illustration
-- WSJ July 10, 1990) It is based on work by Virginia
Applegarth, a principal with the Boston advisory firm TFC
Financial Management. Ms. Applegarth is also the author of
"How to Protect Your Family With Insurance," one in a series
of consumer guides partly underwritten by John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Co., Boston.
   Running through the worksheet clearly shows how the
varying of some key decisions can lead to greatly different
results.
   Consider the hypothetical corporate manager for whom the
10 financial advisers, insurance companies and agents were
asked to make recommendations. Assume the husband, age 45,
earns $75,000 a year and gets life insurance at work of two
times his salary. The wife, 42, earns $25,000 in a part-time
job that doesn't provide group life insurance. Their two
children are 15 and 12.
   Two of the biggest decisions in buying insurance are the
number of years the surviving spouse's income should be
supplemented and at what level.
   The lowest insurance suggestion for the man came from Ms.
Applegarth, who said a "bare-bones" minimum would be
$250,000-$100,000 of new coverage on top of the $150,000
provided by his employer. Using the worksheet, she figured
that sum, added to the family's other resources, would be
sufficient to pay off the mortgage on the family home, fund a
private-college education for the two children and then
supplement the wife's income just until the youngest child is
in college. The assumption was she would then return to
full-time work. ("Some men say, `I'm not feathering the nest
for the next husband,'" notes Peter C. Katt, a West
Bloomfield, Mich., insurance counselor.)
   At the high end, USAA Life Insurance Co., San Antonio,
Texas, diagnosed a need for an additional $1.1 million of
coverage for the hypothetical manager. That assumes that the
wife would continue to work part-time and that her income
would be supplemented to age 80, her approximate life
expectancy. "That's what I would do for my wife," says senior
account representative Michael Ragland.
   USAA sells its policies directly to the public, and
representatives such as Mr. Ragland use computers to analyze
in 10 to 30 minutes the insurance needs of consumers who call
the company toll-free (800-531-8000).
   Another big variable is college costs. Some parents figure
$20,000 a year in today's dollars for an Ivy League school.
Others say they worked their way through college, so their
kids can do the same, says David F. Woods, a Springfield,
Mass., agent.
   There's also the question of whether the insurance is to
be used to pay off the mortgage on the family home. That's an
important goal for many insurance buyers, although financial
planners say it often doesn't make sense to retire a mortgage
early.
   The average recommendation for the hypothetical manager
was for about $600,000 in additional coverage -- $750,000
total. Using the worksheet, with some assumptions that are
more generous than Ms. Applegarth's, produced a similar
suggestion.
   And what about the wife? The insurance specialists
generally agreed that the family should buy insurance on her
life to replace part of her financial contributions to the
family if she died. The suggested amounts again varied widely
with the assumptions made.
   For example, James H. Temple, a vice president at
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J., calculated
that $185,000 in coverage would do nicely to give the husband
the comfort of a paid-off mortgage and an instant college
fund for the children if the wife died tomorrow. Several
other people also suggested coverage between $100,000 and
$200,000. Prudential's computer system analysis said the
insurance need jumps to a steep $421,000 if the family also
wants to use the policy to supplement the husband's income in
retirement.
   Insurance specialists say coverage can also make sense for
a nonworking spouse. The reason: to pay for child care or
other services that would be needed upon that person's death.
