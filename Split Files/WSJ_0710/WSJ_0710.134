   HOUSTON -- Academics and activists again set out to
present the perspective of impoverished nations as a backdrop
to the annual proceedings of the economic summit of
industrialized nations.
   Since 1984, The Other Economic Summit, a loose coalition
of environmentalists, Third World feminists, labor and
political leaders and citizens groups, have convened just
prior to the economic summit of the world's wealthiest
nations. TOES, as it is known, strives to be the conscience
of that meeting.

   This year, here, populist leaders from the world's poorer
regions called for a cancelation of all foreign debt owed by
the Third World, charging debt service has made them "new
colonial tributaries." Summiteers at the alternative meeting
also called for broader environmental initiatives on toxic
waste, other pollution and the global-warming phenomenon.
   Organizers say they will deliver their communiques to the
United Nations and are attempting to submit it to the U.S.
delegation gathered in Houston for the summit of
industrialized nations, which are the so-called Group of
Seven: the U.S., Japan, West German, France, Britain, Italy
and Canada.
   The counter-summit was a low-budget contrast to the main
one. Nearly 1,000 participated in the conclave across from
Houston's Astrodome, where President Bush entertained his
wealthy guests Sunday with a welcoming rodeo and comedian
Minnie Pearl. TOES summiteers were entertained by Himalayan
bell music and a political satirist. A "stress release for
world peace" booth offered up massages to many takers.
   While the world's press here for the G-7 summit were feted
and fed at four of Houston's museums this past weekend, the
counter-summit took a handful of reporters to tour shoddy
housing conditions in the city's Fourth Ward, whose clapboard
shanties jar into a nearby horizon of gleaming skyscrapers.
   A Paris coordinator for last year's TOES summit in France,
a socialist democracy, lamented the shrunken participation at
this year's event and the shrunken publicity. "At the end of
the (Paris) summit . . . because of the press coverage, they
(the industrialized nations) had to meet us," said Anne
Sophie Boisgallais of Paris.
   TOES bills itself as an alternative summit of "seven of
the world's poorest people," though eight groups were
highlighted. This year's representatives came from
Bangladesh, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, the
Philippines, and Nigeria. The eighth group, Native Americans,
were "observers" to the alternative summit, as
representatives of the European Community are observers at
the G-7 summit, an organizer said.
   Many conferees came across the border to Texas from
neighboring Mexico. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a 1988 presidential
candidate in Mexico and the son of a former president, won a
standing ovation when he told the crowd that Third World
nations "don't agree to be treated as merchandise . . . as a
territory to be distributed among industrialized countries."
   Joined in a communique by former presidential candidates
from Brazil and Colombia, Mr. Cardenas also said that drug
trafficking is a "transnational business based in the U.S."
and that it can't be used as "an excuse for U.S. military and
political intervention in Latin American countries, as
recently happened in Panama."
