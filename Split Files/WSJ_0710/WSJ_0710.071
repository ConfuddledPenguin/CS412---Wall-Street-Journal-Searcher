   FRESNO, Calif. -- WestAir Holding Inc. said its June
traffic increased 28% to 57 million revenue passenger miles
from 44.7 million a year earlier, better than expected as the
company's new Atlantic Coast Airlines and Dulles Airport hub
in Washington, D.C., performed particularly well. A revenue
passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
   The carrier's June load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied, eased to 47% from 48%.
