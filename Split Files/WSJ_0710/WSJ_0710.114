   Pitney Bowes Inc. said it expects to report a slight drop
in second-quarter net income from the year-earlier $61.8
million, or 78 cents a share.
   The Stamford, Conn., maker of postage meters, copiers,
voice-processing systems and other products said it will
report revenue growth of about 12% from $693.6 million a year
earlier.

   "However, our net income is weaker than expected because
of continuing weak performance in our operations in Australia
and Germany; because of lower net income at Monarch Marking
Systems due to soft retail market conditions; and because of
higher-than-anticipated costs of reorganizing our copier
business," the company said.
   The company said it doesn't expect to meet analysts'
per-share earnings estimates of $3.50 to $3.70 for all of
1990. But the company said it does expect net income to
exceed the $252.8 million, or $3.19 a share, earned in 1989,
when revenue was $2.88 billion.
