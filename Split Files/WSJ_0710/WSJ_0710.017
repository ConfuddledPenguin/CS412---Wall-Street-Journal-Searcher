   In blue blazers and white shirts, London schoolchildren
may look impeccably British. But these days, many of their
shoes are made in America.
   Last year, more than 300,000 British feet were shod in new
Timberlands, rugged shoes and boots manufactured in New
Hampshire. They have become so popular in Europe that muggers
in Italy have been known to yank them off victims' feet.

   In Germany, health concerns are forcing the removal of
asbestos insulation from countless postwar buildings. The
unpleasant work is made easier by equipment manufactured and
sold by Critical Industries Inc., of Houston.
   The Soviets, too, are beginning to "buy American." This
fall, at the request of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health,
Mayer Laboratories Inc., of Oakland, Calif., will start
exporting a product long in woefully short supply in the
U.S.S.R.: condoms.
   As the leaders of the world's seven largest industrial
nations meet in Houston, the success of U.S. businesses in
Europe tells of a surprising global turnaround. Americans may
still worry that their nation is on the losing end of
international trade. But in Europe, a growing demand for
everything from Chrysler minivans to Converse Allstars has
turned a once-yawning U.S. trade deficit with Europe into a
surplus.
   Look at the numbers: The gap between what the U.S. buys
from and sells to Western Europe withered from $28.2 billion
in 1986 to $1.3 billion in 1989. And for the first four
months of 1990, the Commerce Department reported a $2.7
billion surplus with Western Europe.
   Moreover, most analysts believe the upheavals in Eastern
Europe will cause this U.S. surplus to widen rapidly. Even if
U.S. companies move slowly into newly opened markets such as
Poland, Hungary and East Germany, they will benefit as West
European competitors turn eastward.
   "There will be a vacuum caused by West Germany moving its
surplus to the East," predicts Adrian Dillon, chief economist
at Eaton Corp. in Cleveland. "That means there will be new
markets for U.S. producers in Western Europe. We're going to
benefit indirectly but substantially."
   Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., predicts that the U.S. surplus with Europe could reach
$25 billion to $30 billion a year, in a return to the glory
days of American trade more than a decade ago.
   On top of the list of things American that Europeans are
eager to buy is airplanes. European customers ordered 298
airliners from Boeing Co. last year, a 15-fold increase from
the 19 booked in 1984. The Seattle company's new 737 models,
smaller jets introduced in the past few years, have been
especially big sellers among European charter services.
   "Europe is an expanding area. There are new airlines
coming up. A lot of international airlines have tour
businesses there. They have airlines expanding there all the
time," says Kirsti Dunn, Boeing's public-relations manager
for Europe.
   Cigarettes are also a hot item. Last year, Marlboro became
the No. 1 cigarette in France, surpassing sales of the
Gauloises and Gitanes brands produced by a state monopoly and
long almost synonymous with the French. Although most
Marlboros sold in Europe are made in Europe, according to the
manufacturer, Philip Morris Cos., the tobacco shipped by the
company to its European subsidiary contributed to a $500
million jump in U.S. tobacco exports to Europe over the past
four years.
   Multinational giants aren't the only companies involved.
In the three years since Medical Concepts Inc., a small
manufacturer of video endoscopy instruments based in Santa
Barbara, Calif., began exporting, its sales to Europe have
"snowballed," says Angeli Mancuso, the product manager. With
European medical procedures increasingly relying on cameras,
some company executives expect European sales to double again
next year.
   Even the flow of culture has reversed course, with the New
World last year shipping $2.2 billion of paintings, sculpture
and antiques to the Old. Commerce Department figures show
that art-and-antiques has become one of the nation's biggest
categories of exports to Europe, growing even more rapidly
over the past three years than fast-sellers such as
semiconductors, telecommunications gear and hospital and
scientific equipment.
   "Europeans had tended to think of us as an upstart on the
other side of the pond who didn't really have a heritage
yet," says Robert Kenner, senior editor of Art &amp; Antiques
magazine. But after an 18th-century American desk and
bookcase brought an astonishing $12.1 million at an auction
last year, the market for American antiques has taken off.
"Suddenly, there was this record price for any piece of
furniture sold in the world. Suddenly, American furniture,
which had been slowly gaining on Europeans, shot ahead," he
says.
   The elimination of U.S. tax breaks on donations to museums
in 1986 is also encouraging more and more collectors to put
valuable artwork up for auction. And with gifts dwindling,
museums themselves are selling off parts of their collections
to buy new pieces. "What that means is things that have not
been on the market for a very long time are suddenly
appearing," Mr. Kenner says. "The fresh material is very
attractive" to buyers world-wide.
   Whether selling engine turbines or blue jeans, American
companies are benefiting from recent economic trends. In the
early and mid-1980s, the combination of an escalating dollar
and stagnating European economies battered U.S. exports.
America's merchandise trade balance with Western Europe
deteriorated from a $20.6 billion surplus in 1980 to a $28.2
billion deficit in 1986.
   But the dollar, since hitting a devastating high in
February 1985, is down sharply. That makes U.S. goods more
affordable abroad. And recently, European growth has
rebounded. "Europe finally started coming out of the
doldrums," says C. Michael Aho, an economist at the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York. Meanwhile, the recent slow
growth in the U.S. economy is curbing demand for imports.
   The reversal has made a big difference to Caterpillar Inc.
In 1985, the big Peoria, Ill., manufacturer exported $324
million of machines and parts to Europe. In 1986, after the
dollar began descending, the company shipped $449 million
worth. That 38.6% surge came mostly because "realized prices
improved significantly because the dollar weakened," says
Jeff Hawkinson, a company spokesman.
   Cat's exports to Europe have kept climbing ever since.
Last year, they were almost $700 million, more than double
their total just four years before.
   Capital-equipment makers such as Caterpillar have also
profited from European companies' preparations for 1992, when
the 12-nation European Community will eliminate all trade
barriers. The rush to upgrade plants and equipment is opening
opportunities for the U.S., traditionally a leading force in
capital-goods markets.
   "Americans sell capital goods, and the Europeans are
buying," says Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. In 1989, capital goods
accounted for 46% of U.S. exports to Western Europe, and 35%
of all U.S. capital-goods exports went there.
   Also spurring U.S. exports is Europe's "Green" movement,
with its environmental and health concerns. Critical
Industries has found a lucrative niche in Europe for its
asbestos-removal equipment. "Growth in Europe has probably
been a lot faster than anywhere else," says Ken Kondo, vice
president of the five-year-old Houston company's Critical
Engineering Group.
   Solarex Corp., a subsidiary of Amoco Corp., has benefited,
too. Solarex makes solar cells, which convert sunlight
directly into electricity, and last year a large West German
utility bought a Solarex system. European sales have "picked
up very significantly," says John Goldsmith, vice president
of corporate development. "I think the concern in Europe over
pollution problems, environmental problems, Chernobyl has
really helped to amplify the usefulness of this technology."
   With the impending unification of Germany and the opening
of Eastern Europe, both Solarex and Critical Industries
believe that the appeal of their products in Europe will
grow. "Previously, Communist countries were not concerned
about health effects and the environment. Now, concern in
West Germany will be brought over to East Germany," Mr. Kondo
predicts.
   Most American companies acknowledge that it will be some
time before the fledgling market economies in the East have
the cash to buy many American goods. But in the long term,
Caterpillar's Mr. Hawkinson says, "We see a great potential
market there because of the tremendous infrastructure needs
of those countries that haven't been dealt with for a long
time."
   Many analysts expect U.S. companies to reap more-immediate
benefits from changes Eastern Europe is causing in Western
markets. "There's going to be a massive wave of exports from
West Germany to East Germany," says Brian Horrigan, director
of long-term forecasting at WEFA Group, a consulting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "What happens to the markets in Western
Europe that West Germany was exporting to? That opens up huge
opportunities for the U.S."
   Prime Computer Inc., of Nantick, Mass., hopes to increase
sales of its computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided
design systems to West European companies planning to set up
operations in the East.
   "Many of our customers in Germany, Italy and France are
looking for ways to penetrate those markets," says Douglas P.
Smith, Prime Computer's vice president of finance and
business, citing Fiat, Audi, Volvo, Peugeot and other large
European auto makers. "They are looking for how to establish
a manufacturing base in those countries. . . . As they move
into Eastern Europe, they are going to migrate our design
systems along with them and build up a supplier network as
well."
   Migration, in a way, is how it all began for Timberland
Co. in Western Europe. An Italian distributor showed up in
New Hampshire one day and ordered about 4,000 pairs of shoes
to take back to Italy. After Europeans saw them, says Rod
Williams, international vice president, "it's gone bananas
ever since."
