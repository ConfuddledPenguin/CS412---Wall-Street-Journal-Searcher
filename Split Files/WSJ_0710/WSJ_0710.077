   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. said a potential
bidder has emerged that may be interested in topping a $1.42
billion, $44.50-a-share bid for the company by Forstmann,
Little &amp; Co.
   The cable TV equipment maker said an unnamed "financial
entity" has expressed interest in obtaining information about
the company and evaluating a possible transaction. But it
said there aren't any negotiations under way.

   In response to the disclosure, General Instrument stock
rose 62.5 cents to $46.25 a share in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Although the stock is trading well above the Forstmann
Little offer, some takeover stock traders are skeptical that
a higher bid will emerge. These traders and some investment
bankers say the company had already been offered informally
for sale during the past year without attracting any other
bids.
   Documents filed with Forstmann Little's offer said
Forstmann's advisers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres
&amp; Co., will share a fee of $8 million if the purchase is
completed. General Instrument's adviser, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
stands to receive a fee of roughly $8 million based on the
current offer and more if shareholders receive a higher
price.
