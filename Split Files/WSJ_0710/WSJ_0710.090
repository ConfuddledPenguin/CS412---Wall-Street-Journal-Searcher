   LONDON -- The British pound surged on world currency
markets, as bullish signals from the U.K. government gave an
extra kick to a four-month-long rise in the sterling's value.
   At the peak of trading here yesterday morning, the pound
gained 3.36 yen to 273.4 yen -- its highest level against the
Japanese currency since early 1986. Similarly, against the
U.S. dollar, the pound soared by 2.4 cents during the morning
to an 18month high of $1.8127. Against the mark, the pound's
3.12-pfennig rise pushed it to a nine-month high of 2.9850
marks.

   By the end of the day in London, the buying craze that
began in Tokyo had lost some steam. But London currency
traders forecast that the pound's rise isn't over yet. Since
March 21, the pound has climbed 14% against the dollar and
10% against the mark. And though profit-taking in coming days
may briefly interrupt the pound's climb, "most people still
feel there's room for it {sterling} to go further" up in
value, said analyst Peter Spencer of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Securities in London.
   The main reason for the pound's climb is politics. Since
March, the ruling Conservative Party has narrowed its lag
behind the Labor Party in British opinion polls -- raising
the odds of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surviving next
year's expected general elections.
   More importantly, the government has been sending the
currency markets increasingly bullish signals that it plans a
speedy entry into the European Monetary System's exchange
rate mechanism, or ERM. In that system, participating
governments agree to hold their currencies on
foreign-exchange markets within a narrow band of pre-assigned
values. The pound's entry into ERM, economists say, would
help stablize the volatile currency and control Britain's
steep, 9%-plus rate of inflation. The anticipation of ERM
entry -- perhaps by year end -- has put a rocket under the
pound in recent weeks.
   The immediate trigger for yesterday's surge were reports
in London's Sunday Times and yesterday's Independent
newspapers that the British Treasury doesn't plan any quick
interest-rate cuts and is plotting its specific strategy for
ERM entry. A Treasury spokesman in London dismissed the
articles as mere "speculation." But at the economic summit in
Houston his boss, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
added further fuel to the fire by suggesting that the pound's
recent rise is sustainable.
   Several London analysts believe Mr. Major and his aides
are deliberately "talking up" the pound's value. "They're
very keen to get the exchange rate up" to control U.K.
inflation, said London analyst Robin Marshall of Chase
Investment Bank Ltd.
   The ruling Tories are struggling to cut the country's
steep inflation rate -- a politically potent issue. One
relatively minor report on inflation came yesterday, when the
government announced that British producer prices rose 0.2%
in June from Maywhich translates into a less-than-expected
6.2% annual rate. But the next major inflation report may
embarrass the Tories. On Friday, private economists predict,
the government may report retail price inflation accelerated
in June to slightly less than 10%.
   Hyping the pound is one of the Tories' last available
inflation-fighting tools, Chase's Mr. Marshall said. They
can't use their customary weapon, raising interest rates,
without risking a recession and political grief; U.K. bank
base rates are already at a stratospheric 15%. In the short
term, a strong pound fights inflation by lowering the cost to
British industry of imported supplies. It also makes U.K.
products more expensive abroad and thereby curbs British
corporate profits and wage increases. The London stock
market, anticipating the pound's effect on corporate profits,
slipped in light trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index fell 2.5 points to 2337.5.
   Still, some London economists grumble that the Tories' new
inflation weapon has big risks and that the currency markets
are overly optimistic. The pound "is starting to look
overextended," said London-based analyst Mark Austin of
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. While he expects the
pound's value to pass three marks, he warns that any bad
political news could easily short-circuit the climb.
   One opportunity for trouble, he says, will be the
publication July 26 of a book by Sir Alan Walters, an ERM
critic and Mrs. Thatcher's ex-economics adviser. The book, he
says, could reopen the debate within the Tory Party over ERM
membership -- and shake market assumptions about the terms
and speed of Britain's ERM entry.
   But currency traders weren't in the mood for cautious
counsel. Even after profit-taking in the afternoon here
damped the morning's rise, the pound ended the day in London
at $1.8045, up 1.7 cents from Friday's close. Against the
yen, the pound settled here at 272.47 yen, up 2.38 yen.
Against the mark, the pound late yesterday was trading here
at 2.9767 marks, up 2.11 pfennigs.
   In late New York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.8080,
up from $1.7860 Friday and at 2.9886 marks, up from 2.9505
marks. The dollar stood at 1.6530 marks, up 0.0010 from
Friday's quote, and at 151.15 yen, off 0.55.
   In Tokyo early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 150.55
yen soon after the opening, down a bit from Monday's Tokyo
close of 150.70 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading
at 1.6490 marks, up slightly from Monday's Tokyo close of
1.6487 marks.
   Over the next month, Chase's Mr. Marshall predicted, the
pound will likely climb further. "We all know that it's
overvalued. But it takes a lot of courage to stand in the way
of it" and sell the pound for fear of losing out on a further
climb, he said. He warned, however, that the eventual
fallperhaps late this year when Britain actually joins the
ERM and traders rush to cash in their gains -- will be steep
and fast.
   "Once it {the pound} turns around, it could be: `Last man
out, turn off the lights,' " he said.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$357.35 an ounce.
