   OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc. said federal antitrust
regulators requested additional information about the
company's planned $1.34 billion cash and stock purchase of
Beatrice Co.
   In early June, ConAgra agreed to acquire Beatrice from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which had taken the company
private in 1986. At that time, the transaction had been
expected to close in about a month.

   ConAgra said the request, under Hart-Scott-Rodino
regulations, extends the waiting period for completion of the
transaction until 20 days after the Federal Trade
Commission's request has been fully met.
   Both food companies received the request, and in a joint
statement noted that it isn't unusual for the FTC to seek
additional information in such a transaction.
   Neither company would disclose what data the agency are
seeking, and the FTC wouldn't comment.
   John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., pointed out that "normally, big deals get more
attention" from regulators. The analyst added that there
isn't a "tremendous amount of overlap between" the two
companies.
   Mr. McMillin noted, as have others, that ConAgra and
Beatrice are both major forces in the prepared-meats
business, and that the FTC may be scrutinizing the antitrust
implications in that field.
   ConAgra's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles M.
Harper, has said he wasn't worried about antitrust problems,
saying "we think we're below the threshold of their
{regulators'} concern level."
   The companies said they plan a full and prompt response to
the FTC request.
