   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. filed patent-infringement
lawsuits against five U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,
claiming it is owed royalties on a basic chipmaking process.
   The suits, filed in federal court here, allege that five
small specialty manufacturers are importing and selling chips
that infringe a patent issued to Texas Instruments in 1977
covering a process to encase integrated circuits in plastic.

   The defendant firms are Analog Devices Inc., Norwood,
Mass.; Cypress Semiconductor Corp., San Jose, Calif.;
Integrated Device Technology Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.; LSI
Logic Corp., Milpitas, Calif., and VLSI Technology Inc., San
Jose.
   Texas Instruments, a semiconductor and defense concern,
said it also filed a complaint with the International Trade
Commission against the same manufacturers. Earlier, the
international trade tribunal upheld Texas Instruments's
complaint that Japanese and Korean chip companies had
infringed the same patent.
   Richard J. Agnich, a senior vice president of Texas
Instruments, said the company is taking the actions "to
prevent the unauthorized use of its technology and protect
the significant investments the company has made in
development of intellectual property that is used in
integrated circuits around the world."
   Industry analysts said the move was part of a strategy by
Texas Instruments to milk additional revenue out of
technology it has pioneered over the years. In 1987, the
company won landmark settlements against several competitors
from Japan and South Korea, forcing them to pay royalties
that have totaled $574 million to date.
   "TI is foraging through its storehouse finding all of
these patent claims," says Richard Whittington, an analyst
for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "It's a real plus for them."
   The revenue potential in this latest round of lawsuits is
unclear. While the packaging costs amount to only pennies per
chip, alternative packaging methods are much more costly.
"The question is how much can TI extract from the industry,"
said Michael Gumport, senior electronics analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. "I don't think it is unreasonable to talk
about a penny a chip" on as many as 20 billion devices, the
analyst said. Texas Instruments declined to discuss its
royalty requests.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texas
Instruments shares closed at $39.25, up 50 cents.
   Integrated Device Technology promised to fight the
lawsuit. "I'm certain we're going to challenge it," said Jack
Menache, vice president and general counsel. Other defendants
either declined to comment or couldn't be reached.
