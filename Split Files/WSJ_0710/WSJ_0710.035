   What do you do when you're the crown prince but you don't
get the throne?
   It's a conundrum that can undo even the savviest senior
executive. "Heirs apparent are adorned with all sorts of
terms, from fair-haired child to hunting buddy," says Jeffrey
Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Emory University. When
they don't inherit the kingdom, "it's the first feeling of
failure they've had in their lives. A suffocating sense of
panic hits."

   Consider Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s John E. Pepper, who became
the heir apparent at the consumer-products giant when he was
named president four years ago. Then last October, P&amp;G
directors stunned Mr. Pepper and industry officials by
promoting Vice Chairman Edwin L. Artzt to chief executive.
   Mr. Pepper, 51 years old, won't talk, but insiders say he
was devastated by the news. He "sees 42-year-olds running
major corporations, and he may feel 10 years behind the
timetable he has in mind," says Mr. Sonnenfeld. "Heirs get
antsy."
   Such was the case with William Kagler who, as president
and heir apparent at Kroger Co., barked orders and openly
criticized his boss, Chairman Lyle Everingham, according to
people at the company. When Mr. Kagler began prodding board
members about a timetable for his rise to chief executive,
Mr. Everingham fired him. Now head of Skyline Chili Inc., Mr.
Kagler doesn't want to talk about his time as heir apparent
at Kroger. "There isn't much good to say about being No. 2,"
Mr. Kagler says.
   Mr. Pepper now must decide whether to seek a chief
executive's spot elsewhere or endure a long wait for another
shot at the P&amp;G throne. He was a finalist for the chief
executive post at Campbell Soup Co., according to several
present and former P&amp;G managers. A person familiar with the
Campbell search says Mr. Pepper was one of six candidates
interviewed by a board search committee. Campbell ultimately
tapped former Gerber Products Co. Chief Executive David W.
Johnson.
   Mr. Pepper declined to comment. But Gerald S. Gendell, a
P&amp;G public affairs official, says Mr. Pepper "categorically
denies" that he was a finalist for the Campbell chief
executive spot. "John Pepper never sought that job, nor was
he interviewed for it," Mr. Gendell says. "Further, he is not
actively looking for a position outside P&amp;G."
   Mr. Artzt, 60, has several years more as P&amp;G's chief
executive. He says Mr. Pepper "is a very young guy with a
hell of a future," but declines to comment further.
   Whether most rebuffed heirs remain loyal to their
companies depends in large part on their relationship with
the new chief executive. Some stay, but in effect retire on
the job. Others try to sabotage their rival as if to prove
the board made a mistake. Still others carve out a niche in
which to excel.
   For P&amp;G's Mr. Pepper, trying to make his mark is daunting
because he's inherited the job that made Mr. Artzt a star:
head of P&amp;G's international business. Moreover, the two
executives have very different styles. For one thing, Mr.
Artzt abhors what he calls "ponderosity," and pushes for fast
decisions. Mr. Pepper seeks consensus among others,
deliberating on decisions.
   Others who have walked this path say it's possible to stay
with a company and work closely with the new chief executive.
C. Fred Fetterolf, president of Aluminum Co. of America, lost
the chief executive prize to outsider Paul H. O'Neill three
years ago, but remains at the Pittsburgh company.
   Immediately after Mr. O'Neill accepted the job, he met Mr.
Fetterolf at New York's River Club to urge him to stay at
Alcoa. "It was clear to me that it was in the interest of
Alcoa for people not to leave simply because I was coming,"
says Mr. O'Neill, who himself had been the heir apparent at
International Paper Co. when he left to accept the Alcoa
post.
   The decision wasn't easy for Mr. Fetterolf, who at first
felt angry at being bypassed. "It was a time of
disappointment and surprise," he says. "I had questions about
what our relationship would be."
   But the meetings with Mr. O'Neill proved decisive. "He was
very sensitive from the very beginning," says Mr. Fetterolf,
61. "He will rarely do anything of importance on his own."
   Mr. O'Neill even offered to establish an office of the
chairman, with all operations reporting to both him and Mr.
Fetterolf. Though Mr. Fetterolf thought that would send the
wrong signals to people in the company and declined the
offer, the gesture nonetheless helped win his confidence.
   Since then, other companies have tried to woo Mr.
Fetterolf away. He still hears rumors that he will leave
Alcoa, which he joined as a sales trainee nearly four decades
ago. But he says he has no plans to leave.
   Often, though, the heir apparent is unable to overcome the
inevitable feelings of disappointment. Mr. Sonnenfeld, the
business professor, describes the period after an heir is
bypassed as the "fallen hero" syndrome, where co-workers
console the executive, quietly saying "you should've gotten
the job."
   Worse yet is the reaction at home. Spouses and children
are supportive, but it's difficult "to face the people who've
taken the moves and put up with sacrifices for his career,"
Mr. Sonnenfeld says. "Now the investment has gone sour."
   At a New York-based professional services firm, the
bypassed heir apparent disappeared after hearing that he
didn't get the chief executive job. Colleagues found his coat
in his office, though it was midwinter, but found no clues to
his whereabouts. Later they learned that the executive had
driven home to Connecticut and stayed in bed for several
days.
   "He couldn't face his family," says Mr. Sonnenfeld. "His
wife was crying because she knew all the time invested was
lost." The executive eventually left the company and went to
a smaller firm.
   Robert E. Fowler Jr., who quit as Rubbermaid Inc.'s
president when he was bypassed for the chief executive's job
three years ago, agrees that "it's tough to be labeled the
heir apparent -- and even tougher to be labeled and not get
the job."
   Mr. Fowler was wooed from General Electric Co. by
Rubbermaid Chairman Stanley C. Gault and assured that he'd
eventually inherit the top spot. But after several years at
the Wooster, Ohio, consumer-products company, Mr. Fowler
found that his expertise in production and distribution was
no longer highly valued. Mr. Gault contended that what the
company needed more was a "marketing and management" wizard.
   "I was disappointed," says Mr. Fowler, who has since
become chairman, chief executive and president of Josephson
Office Products Inc. in Chicago. It's especially frustrating
losing after "you've accomplished a lot and done the things
that were required."
   Determined to avoid that fate, more heirs apparent are
seeking written guarantees from their companies that they
are, in fact, assured of promotion. J. Gerald Simmons,
president of Handy Associates, a New York executive search
firm, says that request comes twice as often as it did a
decade ago. "It used to be done on a handshake," says Mr.
Simmons. "Now they want 14-page employment agreements."
