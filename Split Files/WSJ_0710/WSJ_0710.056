   The West German chemicals group BASF AG said it's in
negotiations with other suppliers over the possibility of
expanding its synthetic printing plate business into a
broader range of products for the printing industry.
   But a spokesman at the company's Ludwigshafen headquarters
couldn't rule out the possibility that BASF might eventually
decide to dispose of the printing plate lines altogether if
it can't reach an accord over broadening its scale of
operations. "Everything is possible," he remarked.

   Monday's report of the plan to seek partners in the
printing sector follows news last week that BASF wants to
dispose of two of its other fringe businesses, one
printing-related. BASF said it is looking for buyers for its
Fritzsche Dodge Olcott flavors and fragrances business in the
U.S., as well as its North American printing ink operations.
The company had said it wanted to dispose of those operations
because they aren't core businesses.
