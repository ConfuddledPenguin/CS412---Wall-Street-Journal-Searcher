   NEW YORK -- A federal judge gave the Manville
personal-injury trust until Aug. 6 to restructure its
financing and to change the way it pays asbestos victims.
   In federal court in Brooklyn, U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein also issued a temporary stay barring the trust from
paying any settlements, judgments, trustees' fees or
plaintiffs' attorney fees until the changes are made.

   "You are not going to proceed as you have been in the
past," Judge Weinstein told trust representatives. "Every
penny of the trust's money must be preserved while the
restructuring goes forward."
   Judge Weinstein also urged attorneys on both sides to
consider combining all asbestos personal-injury cases
nationwide. Unless special steps are taken, he warned, the
increasing asbestos caseload may force other asbestos
defendants into bankruptcy and overwhelm the court system.
   The Manville trust, set up by Manville Corp. in 1986 to
pay the company's asbestos personal-injury claims, has come
under fire recently because of its huge cash shortfall. The
trust, which is independent of the company, was the keystone
of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization.
   Although a cash shortfall was anticipated at the trust, it
has turned out to be much wider than expected. Current
asbestos claimants are being told that they won't be paid by
the trust for 10 to 20 years -- long after most of the
claimants will have died from the cancer and respiratory
ailments caused by asbestos.
   Questions raised by Judge Weinstein and New York state
Justice Helen Freedman, who are jointly trying to settle
about 500 asbestos cases, triggered intense scrutiny of the
trust several weeks ago.
   Leon Silverman, a special adviser appointed by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to review problems at the trust in response
to Judge Weinstein's concerns, conceded yesterday that major
changes are needed. Mr. Silverman played a major role in
designing the trust.
   "It is clear that the trust can't generate sufficient
funds in a timely fashion," Mr. Silverman told the judges. He
said he is making progress in negotiation efforts to improve
the trust's short-term financing.
   Judge Weinstein said the refinancing of the trust could
involve hundreds of millions of dollars in loans or advances
from Manville Corp. The trust's assets are mainly made up of
Manville stock, and the company is to begin contributing part
of its profit to the trust in 1992. The judge said the trust
should also consider acquiring the company or selling its
Manville stock.
   To protect the value of Manville stock, the judge said
that a bankruptcy-court order requiring that all asbestos
lawsuits be filed against the trust, rather than the company,
should continue.
   A spokeswoman for the trust declined to comment on the
judge's order.
