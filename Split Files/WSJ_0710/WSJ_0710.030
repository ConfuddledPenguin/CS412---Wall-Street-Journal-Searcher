   SEATTLE -- The new Miss Washington, Lynnae Marie Thurik,
is a 26-year-old beauty who plays the piano, raises dogs and
has dreamed of competing for the Miss America title since she
was five.
   Disgruntled Miss Washington competitors say she's also a
carpetbagger.

   Miss Thurik, you see, isn't a Washington resident; she's
lived in Oregon since 1972. She went to college in Tacoma,
Wash., but returned to Oregon in 1986 to live in the Portland
suburb of Lake Oswego. Since then, she has worked for This
Week, a Portland-area weekly newspaper where she takes
classified ads for auto dealers and real-estate agents.
   Nevertheless, last October Miss Thurik entered the Miss
Clark County pageant in Vancouver, Wash., just across the
Columbia River from Portland. On her application, she said
her work for This Week took her into Clark County for 20
hours a week -- the minimum requirement for participation in
the tournament, which she won. Then, at the June 23 Miss
Washington pageant, she won the whole tamale.
   Now, other local pageants are challenging her title as
Miss Washington. They say it isn't clear she actually works
20 hours a week in Washington. "If you come across the bridge
and call on an indeterminate number of people for an
indeterminate amount of time and you live in another state,
does that qualify you?" asks Patty Belik, president of the
Washington State Association of Local Miss America Pageants.
   Organizers of the Miss Washington pageant defend Miss
Thurik's participation. Phyllis Goldhammer says Ms. Thurik
has attended school in Clark County (Basic Camera and Trim
and Tone at the local community college) as well as working
there, making her fully eligible for the pageant. "Why didn't
they raise these questions last October?" she says of Ms.
Belik and others. And those who know Miss Thurik insist that
she wouldn't bend the rules. "She's about the most honest
person I have ever met," says Mike Olmstead, her supervisor
at This Week. (Miss Thurik wasn't available for comment.)
   But the directors of the 17 other local pageants aren't
convinced. They've sent a registered letter to Leonard Horn,
chief executive of the national Miss America Pageant (to be
held Sept. 8 in Atlantic City, N.J.), requesting a ruling on
whether or not Miss Thurik qualifies. "There are some
inconsistencies in the rules, and we want them clarified,"
says Ms. Belik.
