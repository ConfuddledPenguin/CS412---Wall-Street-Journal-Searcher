   NEW YORK -- Bear Stearns Cos. and Morgan Stanley Group
Inc. accounted for about half of all stock-index arbitrage
activity on the New York Stock Exchange for the week ended
Sept. 7.
   In its regular weekly report on computer-aided program
trading, the Big Board said program trading accounted for
9.8% of average daily volume, or 11.4 million shares a day.
That was down from 12.7% the previous week.

   Index arbitrage -- rapid-fire purchases and sales of
baskets of stocks with offsetting trades in futures and
options -- accounted for 53.9% of total program trading by
all firms. Bear Stearns used arbitrage in nearly all its
program trading; Morgan Stanley used it in slightly more than
half.
   Overall, the busiest program traders were Morgan Stanley
(10 million shares), Bear Stearns (6.8 million), Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. (5.7 million), General Electric Co.'s Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. (4.3 million) and CS First Boston Inc.'s First
Boston Corp. (4.2 million). Bear Stearns and Kidder did most
of their trading for their own accounts; the other firms for
customers' accounts.
   "Buy" programs accounted for an average 3.8 million shares
and "sell" programs for 7.6 million, during a week in which
the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a basket of at
least 15, and often hundreds, of stocks with a value of at
least $1 million.
