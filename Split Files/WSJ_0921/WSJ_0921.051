   As a loyal party man, George Bush plans to travel more for
GOP candidates this fall than any president in memory. Just
don't expect him to say very much.
   Stumping in California this week, Mr. Bush issued this
call to arms: "We can serve our country by being the best
candidates, the best citizens, and, yes, the best Republicans
and Democrats we can be." He stressed Iraq, crime, a clean
environment, a growing economy -- he was against the first
two, but for the latter.

   The president's politesse reflects his temperament, but
also the theme of this year's congressional elections: There
is no theme. So far there are barely any issues, especially
for Republicans. Democrats have S&amp;Ls and abortion (in some
places), an uncertain economy, and the historical midterm
reaction against a president's party. About the best thing
Republicans have is Saddam Hussein.
   "We're right back where we've always been -- war and the
economy," says GOP consultant Eddie Mahe, with an audible
sigh of relief. The Iraq crisis helps incumbents and provides
an excuse for recession, he says, and Mr. Bush's revived
popularity will dilute GOP losses. Without Iraq? "Absolute
disaster," he says.
   This non-trend trend is evident in Senate races where the
GOP has potent challengers. Style trumps substance. In Rhode
Island, 43-year-old Rep. Claudine Schneider is running on the
need for "new leadership" against 71-year-old Sen. Claiborne
Pell. Age and sex are their only apparent differences. In
Illinois, able Rep. Lynn Martin has found her anti-tax
message blunted by George Bush's reversal on no-new-taxes. So
she's fallen back on such political standbys as incumbent
Paul Simon's missed Senate votes, desire to run for president
and personal intervention for lobbyists.
   Tom Tauke, a brainy, moderate GOP congressman, seems like
the perfect challenger for Iowa's Tom Harkin, one of the
Senate's loudest liberals. But tax-and-spend was also Mr.
Tauke's best issue. He still sounds off on taxes, but it's
hardly Joshua's trumpet. He also muddles the issue by
charging Mr. Harkin with failing to "bring home the bacon" of
federal spending to Iowa. And how will Mr. Tauke vote if a
budget deal includes higher taxes? "We're keeping our options
open," says his press secretary.
   Mr. Tauke is left to stress "quality of representation"
issues. His slogan is the riveting, "He Puts Iowa First." And
he attacks Mr. Harkin for -- hold onto your outrage -- having
a mere post-office box, rather than a home, in the state.
Polls show voters are underwhelmed.
   The tax issue is now so muddled that it's working for many
Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is
actually advising its candidates to oppose higher taxes
(except on "the rich") and endorse tax relief for the middle
class. "We've been burned so much on taxes, that's what I
tell all the candidates," says Richard Bates, the DCCC's
executive director.
   Marguerite Chandler, a businesswoman competing for an open
seat in New Jersey, is running ads attacking Democratic Gov.
Jim Florio's recent tax increases. She also attacks her GOP
opponent, a state legislator, for "politics as usual." She
has a good chance to retake this GOP seat. Indiana Democrat
Jill Long is sticking to the no-new-tax pledge that helped
her win Dan Quayle's old seat in 1989 by some 1,700 votes.
She's well ahead in the polls.
   Republicans also once hoped to take advantage of any
anti-incumbent sentiment. This could still help in the
Senate, where Democrats have more seats at risk. But in the
House, the GOP has just as many vulnerable incumbents as
Democrats have. In any event, the "bipartisanship" of the
past year has given voters little reason to think Republicans
aren't also to blame.
   The GOP's most notable anti-Washingtonian, Georgian Newt
Gingrich, is himself under attack for "wheeling and dealing
in Washington." Democrat David Worley is passing out a bumper
sticker, "No Newt Pay Raise," despite a Democratic vow not to
compete on that issue. Another member of the GOP House
leadership, Mickey Edwards, has opposed a 12-year limit on
legislative terms. But the limit passed this week by 2-to-1
in his home state of Oklahoma. He now dodges and weaves: "The
people have a right to put on limitations, but you have to
look at the downside."
   S&amp;Ls might have been a good GOP issue ("Jim Wright"), but
Democrats have been more skillful at framing it
("deregulation," "Neil Bush"). Challengers in both parties
will use it when an incumbent's got blood on his hands, but
Republicans have a harder sell. Their best hope is to depose
Illinois Rep. Frank Annunzio, Freddy St Germain's
comrade-in-(S&amp;L)-alms.
   It's a symptom of GOP congressional complacency that the
talk already is that a mere drubbing (as opposed to a rout)
will be a victory. A loss of 10 House seats or a draw in the
Senate will be celebrated. Nineteen straight losing House
(and three Senate) campaigns in a row, Republicans will say,
but it could have been worse] Yet a loss of even six seats in
the House would put them below 170 -- where they've been only
six times since 1950.
   As the majority, Democrats flourish in a stand-pat
election. Republicans need to give voters a reason to oust
incumbents. So far they haven't. This could change at a
stroke if the budget talks collapse and George Bush takes his
spending and capital-gains-cut case to the voters. Marc
Nuttle, the valiant executive director of the GOP
Congressional Committee, says with calculated understatement,
"I would not be distraught to run on that platform."
   But the betting in Washington is that this is as likely as
the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series.
