   Cockerill Sambre S.A. said unconsolidated profit for the
first six months of fiscal 1990 rose 22%, to 8.9 billion
Belgian francs ($275.6 million) from 7.3 billion Belgian
francs in the year-earlier period.
   Sales declined 6% to 50.1 billion Belgian francs from 53.3
billion Belgian francs.

   The Belgian steel foundry said the increase in profit was
due to extraordinary gains. Without the gains, profit would
have been about half the level of year-ago earnings, the
company said.
   Cockerill predicted noticeably weaker second-half results
because of lower prices and volume for steel products.
Moreover, it said it didn't expect to realize the same level
of one-time gains as during the first half.
   "The profit for 1990 should nonetheless remain
satisfactory, without attaining the exceptional level seen in
1989,' the company said.
