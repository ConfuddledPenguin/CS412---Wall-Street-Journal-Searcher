   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Just a few months ago, Lockheed Corp.
executive Sherman Mullin stood on the steps of the company's
aircraft materials center here and watched the desert sun
sink, along with his spirits.
   Off to his right sprawled the factory where rival Rockwell
International Corp. once assembled B-1 bombers; these days,
under a leftover banner proclaiming "Progress for Peace," it
upgrades commercial jetliners instead. Nearby, Northrop Corp.
builds the radar-evading B-2 Stealth bomber; but with the
Warsaw Pact collapse, the factory has barely escaped being
mothballed by lawmakers eager for a peace dividend.

   "This is one of the last enclaves of military aviation,"
Mr. Mullin mused. "And you've got to wonder how long it can
last."
   Longer than ever, it suddenly seems, now that the world is
on the brink of war again. Defense contractors, although wary
of jumping the gun, clearly view Iraq's thrust into Kuwait
and the U.S.'s launch of Operation Desert Shield as a
much-needed transfusion for their moribund businesses.
   "The Iraqi invasion will really stimulate thought about
how we should be armed 10, 20, 30 years from now," says Mr.
Mullin, a beefy, straight-talking Lockheed veteran who's
developing what the company hopes will become the Air Force's
next generation of jet fighter. "The military services had
tried to articulate that there are other threats out there
besides Russia. But nobody, including Congress, seemed
convinced. What's happening now is pivotal."
   Lockheed figures to be featured prominently in any debate
over how the U.S. should shape its arsenal of the future. As
the builder of the C-5 and C-141 transport aircraft that have
hauled more than five billion pounds of material to the
Persian Gulf in the past six weeks, the company stands to
benefit, long term, from a renewed call for more airlift
capability. In particular, the four-engine C-130 Hercules
transport -- which the company had envisioned dribbling out
at three a month -- could be destined for a faster rate of
production.
   More immediately, McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new C-17
military cargo plane, which is being riveted together inside
a giant Long Beach, Calif., factory, has gained some clout.
"We need a fast, mobile system that can move people right
into a combat area," says Bob Bresette, deputy general
manager of the program, sounding a theme that many outside
observers say has become an easier sell to Capitol Hill.
Indeed, although the C-17 has been beleaguered by cost
overruns and delays, supporters contend that it is perfect
for snuffing out Third World conflagrations because of its
ability to carry 167,000 pounds of equipment 2,400 nautical
miles and then land on a short, remote strip of land.
   Similarly, demand is certain to increase for cargo ships,
particularly swift ones.
   Litton Industries Inc. recently completed a study for the
Navy on "fast sea-lift" vessels that could tote 20,000 tons
of personnel and gear at speeds as high as 55 knots, twice as
fast as today's cargo ships. "We're looking at the Mideast as
an important opportunity," says Gerald St. Pe, the executive
in charge of the company's giant Ingalls shipyard in
Mississippi.
   Perhaps the biggest boon, however, will be for those
companies adept at exporting their goods. The Bush
administration, trying to fortify its Mideast allies,
disclosed last week that it plans to sell new arms valued at
about $20 billion to Saudi Arabia. The cache, which comes on
the heels of a $2 billion deal with the Saudis, is likely to
include 17 Lockheed C-130s; 24 F-15 fighters and 48 Apache
attack helicopters, built by McDonnell Douglas; about 700 M-1
battle tanks made by General Dynamics Corp., including some
previously committed; Raytheon Co.'s Patriot ground-to-air
missiles; Bradley Fighting Vehicles, a product of FMC Corp.;
as well as training, communications and support equipment.
Already, Israel is demanding parity with Saudi Arabia, which
would generate even more business abroad for U.S. companies.
   Still, how any of this will translate to the bottom line
-- and when -- is uncertain. Iraq or not, the military
establishment remains in the midst of its steepest nose dive
in 40 years.
   The melting away of the Cold War is still going to cause a
rapid decline in the military budget, tens of thousands of
layoffs across the country and a continuing exodus of
companies doing business with the Pentagon. Phillip Karber,
of BDM Corp., which counsels the Pentagon on technical
issues, points out that with the cost of deploying and
maintaining a force in the Mideast expected to run about $1
billion a month, there simply may be no money left for new
weapons development.
   Nevertheless, in due course, Congress and the Defense
Department "will shift their attention to lessons learned in
the Mideast," predicts Michael Rich, vice president for
national security at Rand Corp., the think tank. That change
in focus, he suggests, will affect "not only the level of
future defense budgets, but their composition as well."
   There is little mystery to where the money might go. In
many ways, the Mideast situation only underscores concepts
that have long been evolving inside arms makers' laboratories
and research centers.
   Joe Falkner, a manager with Colsa Corp., an El Paso,
Texas, company that is advising the Army on the kinds of
airborne weapons needed on the battlefield of the future,
notes: "What's going on in the Middle East is that we're
staring at short- to medium-range tactical missiles. And in
the past, we've thought about how you see them and intercept
them." Yet traditionally, Mr. Falkner says, "by the time the
defense budget has been completed," development money to
explore this area more thoroughly "is usually what falls
out."
   William Perry, Pentagon research chief during the Carter
administration, says the Defense Department has been so
intent on developing the Strategic Defense Initiative, a
space-based missile shield to thwart Soviet warheads, that
money for less exotic but more practical ground-based systems
"just sort of dried up."
   Lockheed, General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division,
Rockwell, Boeing Co. and TRW Inc. -- all of which have been
major players in SDI research -- may benefit if new funding
is allocated for a more down-to-earth anti-missile network.
   The key to any advanced weapons system, experts say, lies
in the continued development of high-tech electronics. That
bodes well for companies such as Loral Corp., E-Systems Inc.
and Hughes, leaders in outfitting missiles with sensors and
jet fighters with radar-warning receivers and jamming
instruments. "One of the advantages of modern electronics is
that they're reliable," explains Peter Oram, who runs Grumman
Corp.'s aircraft division. "That means fewer people, fewer
parts and less test equipment."
   The Pentagon will require lighter, more flexible weapons.
Retired Army Gen. Donald Keith, while arguing for a balance
between heavy and light forces, singles out the service's
"armored gun system," a tank that would be about half the
weight of a 65-ton M-1 Abrams. Although FMC, General
Dynamics, Teledyne Inc. and Textron Inc.'s Cadillac Gage unit
have done some design studies on it, "the system never made
the priority cut when those tough budget choices had to be
made," says Gen. Keith, president of Cypress International,
which advises contractors on R&amp;D decisions. "Now, it probably
will."
   U.S. troops also will need superior ground protection.
Such is the aim of the Fox reconnaissance vehicle, which is
designed to provide protection from nuclear, biological and
chemical blasts. Already, more than 1,000 Fox chassis have
been produced by Thyssen Henschel, a West German company, and
the Pentagon wants General Dynamics to begin upgrading those
and then build its own by 1994.
   For many contractors, the military's changing mandate will
offer both pluses and minuses. At Lockheed, for instance, the
strong support it has enjoyed on Capitol Hill for its
strategic Trident II missile could conceivably wane. Other
companies producing nuclear weapons and their components,
including Boeing, Rockwell and Northrop, may face similar
roadblocks.
   Moreover, bringing any new weapon from the drawing board
to the trenches is a slow and risky process for defense
concerns, which find themselves subject to the vagaries of
politicians, generals and Wall Street. "You can't scrap
everything and suddenly change direction overnight," says
Daniel Tellep, Lockheed's chairman.
   For one thing, systems are so technically complex
nowadays, it takes years to get them to work right. And when
they slip behind schedule -- as they almost always do -- it
leads to hand-wringing by lawmakers, who are then inclined to
take a whack at the program budget. That slows progress even
more.
   In addition, many corporations have been burned by putting
up lots of money to design a new weapon only to have the
government decide it doesn't really want such a gizmo after
all. And should a company get too pushy, it risks offending a
monolithic market: The Defense Department is known among
Pentagon suppliers simply and deferentially as The Customer.
   "You try and listen very carefully and help the military
people understand what is possible," says George Heilmeier,
senior vice president and chief technical officer at Texas
Instruments Corp. But in the end, he says, "it's a juggling
act."
   The Dallas company has proven more dexterous than many of
its competitors. For instance, it recently won a contract to
make a light, shoulder-fired tank destroyer known as the
AAWS-M. "It would drive the Iraqis nuts," says Mr. Heilmeier.
