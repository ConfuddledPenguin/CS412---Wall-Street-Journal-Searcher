   PITTSBURGH -- PPG Industries Inc. said it will shut down
its Crystal City, Mo., flat-glass manufacturing plant by the
end of the year because of excess capacity in that industry
and high costs to modernize the plant.
   PPG will meet with officials of the Aluminum, Brick &amp;
Glass Workers International Union, which represents the
plant's 231 production, maintenance and clerical employees,
to negotiate benefits and other conditions of termination.
The paints, chemical and glass manufacturer said the closing
wouldn't result in a charge.
