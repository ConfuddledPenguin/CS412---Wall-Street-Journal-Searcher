   OTTAWA -- Canadian steel production totaled 159,248 metric
tons in the week ended Saturday, up 0.4% from 158,653 tons in
the preceding week but down 46% from 286,816 tons a year
earlier, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The drop from the 1989 pace is partly attributable to an
ongoing strike at Stelco Inc., a steel concern.
