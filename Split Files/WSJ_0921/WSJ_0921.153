   IS BUSINESS OVERLOOKING the obvious?
   When new trade and investment opportunities are mentioned,
Europe is the world on everybody's lips, the talisman for
financiers and investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. And with
reason. The economic integration of the European Community
nations in 1992 and the opening of potentially rich new
markets in the East Bloc countries promise big profits for
those who position themselves early and well.

   But while businessmen and money men alike rivet their
attention on the Old World, a new economic colossus is slowly
and quietly taking shape in the new one. Call it Canamerico.
   With only modest attention being paid, Canada, the U.S.
and Mexico are gradually moving toward creation of a single
huge trade entity. Canada and the U.S. have already signed a
trade agreement that will wipe out tariff barriers and other
impediments; Mexico, which has cast aside its former
protectionism, now wants a similar pact. It will probably get
it.
   If Canamerico indeed comes into being, it would be a
powerhouse by almost any measure, exceedingly rich in natural
resources (particularly coal and natural gas), technology,
agricultural production, capital, and available labor. But
Canamerico is not reality yet, and the road to trade
unification is proving a hard one, full of potholes -- as
both Canada and Mexico are finding out.
                                                                                                       

   MOST CANADIAN business executives were enthusiastic when
their country signed a free-trade pact with the U.S., but few
were more delighted than Guy Champagne. He says he thought it
was good for the country and especially good for Exeltor
Inc., of which he is president and controlling shareholder.
   Exeltor makes industrial knitting needles at a plant near
Montreal. Nobody in the U.S. makes the same kind of needles.
Under the free-trade pact, a 12% U.S. tariff on Exeltor's
products was lifted as soon as the agreement took effect on
Jan. 1, 1989.
   That should have left Exeltor with a big edge over its
Japanese and German competitors, who still face the tariff.
Mr. Champagne says he expected U.S. sales to balloon 50%
within three years. But that hasn't happened. Instead,
Exeltor's U.S. sales have shown little growth.
   What has happened is that the Canadian dollar has risen
sharply, meaning that Americans have to pay more U.S. dollars
to buy Canadian goods. "The Canadian dollar's gain has so far
wiped out the benefit of the tariff cut" for Exeltor, Mr.
Champagne says. Since the free-trade pact was signed, the
Canadian dollar has risen 12% against the U.S. dollar,
offsetting the end of the 12% tariff.
   It's far too early, however, to say which country benefits
more from the Canada-U.S. agreement; the pact won't even be
fully effective until 1998. In Canada, the early returns are
mixed: Some companies have gained business, others have lost
it. But at least one thing is clear: Currency and
interest-rate movements can overwhelm any tinkering with
tariffs.
   And the Canadian currency has moved rapidly. The Canadian
dollar is valued at about 86.5 U.S. cents, up from about 84
cents when the pact took effect and 77 cents when it was
signed at the beginning of 1988. The dollar's rise wasn't
caused by free trade. It was driven by soaring Canadian
interest rates, which are needed to lure foreign financing
for the government's huge budget deficit. Canada's central
bank also keeps rates high to dampen inflation. Thus, along
with the high dollar, Canadian businesses face crushing
financial costs. Canadian short-term interest rates are more
than four percentage points higher than when the pact was
signed. They currently are about five percentage points above
U.S. rates.
   "One can hardly imagine a less propitious economic
climate" for seizing new trade opportunities, says Gordon
Ritchie, who was a key government negotiator of the trade
pact.
   Across the Canadian economy, early results of the
free-trade pact appear disappointing. Last year Canada's
trade surplus with the U.S. was the smallest since 1982.
   The failure of free trade to pay off immediately has
soured the public's attitude toward the agreement. Only 32%
of Canadians now favor it, according to a recent Gallup Poll.
Opponents of closer ties with the U.S. keep meticulous tabs
on Canadian plant closings and blame all of them on the
agreement. Free trade has caused "job carnage in Canadian
industry," says Shirley Carr, president of Canada's main
labor federation, the Canadian Labour Congress.
   But most business executives still think that free trade
is a good idea and that they would be worse off without the
agreement. "I don't back away at all from the premise that it
was right thing to do," says G. Firman Bentley, senior vice
president of Nova Corp. of Alberta, which hoped for big gains
on its petrochemical exports. Nova says a cut to 7.5% from
12.5% in U.S. duties on polyethylene has meant 16 million
Canadian dollars (US$13.9 million) annually in additional
operating income for the company. The gains haven't increased
profit because each one-cent rise in the value of the
Canadian dollar knocks C$7.5 million off Nova's bottom line.
   Some of the disappointment with free trade reflects hopes
that were overblown in the first place. About 75% of
U.S.-Canadian trade already was free of duty before the pact
was signed. Most tariff cuts are being phased in gradually,
over as many as 10 years. Thus, average U.S. tariffs on
dutiable Canadian goods fell only to 3% last year from 4%
before the agreement took effect. Average Canadian tariffs
were down to 9.4% from 9.7%.
   Nevertheless, there have been gains because of the trade
agreement. Exporters like it so much that, at their urging,
the U.S. and Canadian governments in April speeded up planned
tariff cuts on more than 400 products ranging from ball-point
pens to diesel locomotives. And some benefits have nothing to
do with tariffs.
   Helmut Eppich, chairman, part owner and chief executive
officer of closely held Ebco Industries Ltd., says the
agreement "makes us much more competitive" because of a
little-known provision that eases cross-border movement of
certain workers. The Vancouver, British Columbia, metal
fabricator recently sent 35 employees to California to
install a complicated gantry crane at an aircraft plant.
Under the old rules, it would have had to hire and train a
local crew for the temporary job.
   Roger Phillips, president and chief executive officer of
Ipsco Inc., a steelmaker, says the U.S. probably would have
extended its steel-import quotas to include Canada if the
free-trade agreement hadn't been signed. That's important to
Ipsco, because 15% of its sales are in the U.S.
   Ms. Carr, of the union group, ticks off 25 cases in which
makers of everything from carpets to X-ray equipment have
closed Canadian plants or moved some production to the U.S.
because of the free-trade agreement. Some production,
however, has moved in the other direction, and there is no
clear proof that one country has benefited over another.
   Whirlpool Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary is an example from
Ms. Carr's list. It stopped making washing machines after the
pact was signed and moved that operation to Ohio. Since then,
however, Whirlpool has shifted to Canada production of
household trash compactors, kitchen ranges and compact
dryers.
   "Free trade was one factor, it wasn't the primary factor,"
says Maurice Dutrisac, a vice president at Whirlpool's
Canadian unit, Inglis Ltd. Even without the free-trade
agreement, Whirlpool would have consolidated production of
certain appliances in an effort to make its plants more
competitive, he says. For example, the Toronto
washing-machine factory was shut down and production moved to
the U.S. because the Canadian plant was obsolete.
   But the certainty that duties will decline over time did
help Whirlpool decide to manufacture in Canada some types of
kitchen ranges and all its compact dryers and residential
trash compactors for the North American market, Mr. Dutrisac
adds.
   Statistics don't prove much, either. The total of Canadian
jobs has risen by 194,000 since the agreement took effect,
but the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 158,000.
Expected benefits from free trade were at least partly
responsible for a 14.9% surge last year in Canadian
plant-and-equipment investment. Soaring interest rates,
however, have helped cut this year's estimated increase to
6.1%.
   One clear victim of the free-trade pact seems to be
Canada's C$5.2 billion-a-year furniture industry. Its mostly
small-scale producers were protected by a 15% tariff that is
being cut year by year until it is eliminated in 1993. Robert
Diguer, an industry lobbyist, says 4,750 out of 62,000
furniture-making jobs have been lost since January 1989.
"Free trade has dramatically hurt the industry in Canada,"
says Bill Nathanson, president of Sealy Furniture Canada
Ltd., a licensee of Sealy Inc., Cleveland. His company has
laid off half the workers at its Toronto plant and opened a
new one in Virginia.
   Yet some businesses suffer from free trade because it
isn't free enough. Mr. Diguer says one reason for furniture
makers' woes is that tariffs won't be fully scrapped until
1998 on imported fabric, and fabric accounts for up to half
the cost of upholstered furniture. Food-processing companies
say they're hurt because tariffs are dropping on what they
produce while Canada retains price-propping import quotas on
raw materials such as eggs, milk and chicken.
