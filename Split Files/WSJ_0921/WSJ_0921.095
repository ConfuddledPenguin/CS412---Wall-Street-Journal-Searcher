   LIEGE, Belgium -- Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A. obtained
a munitions order from a Middle East country totaling 2.4
billion Belgian francs ($74.3 million), an industry executive
said.
   The order, whose size could be doubled later, might
improve the survival chances of FN, which has been teetering
on the edge of bankruptcy proceedings for months. FN, whose
products include various small arms and Browning sport
rifles, is 76%-owned by Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., a
Brussels holding company.

   FN wouldn't comment on the order, but the industry
executive confirmed a report in a Brussels newspaper that the
sale had been concluded. The executive, who declined to be
identified, wouldn't disclose which Middle East country
awarded the contract.
   The executive also confirmed earlier reports that Giat
Industries, a French state-owned arms maker, is in talks that
could lead to an offer to buy all or part of FN. A Giat
spokesman couldn't be reached.
   But the industry executive said Giat isn't the only
company interested in acquiring FN. He declined to name
others.
   FN, whose losses over the past four years have totaled
about 12 billion Belgian francs, has scheduled an
extraordinary shareholders meeting for a week from today.
Holders are expected to decide whether the company should
continue operations. FN's management might report on
prospects for selling the company at the meeting, the
executive said.
