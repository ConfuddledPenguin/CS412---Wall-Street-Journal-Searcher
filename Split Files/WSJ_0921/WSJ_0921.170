   Air France's board decided to intensify the French-owned
airline's cost-cutting program in response to an estimated
loss of 170 million French francs ($32.3 million) in the
first half and oil-related difficulties anticipated in the
second half.
   The board also delayed until 1991 any non-aircraft
investments planned for the rest of this year, while
nonessential work on buildings or information systems has
effectively been canceled.

   Air France also adopted a hiring freeze, with the
exception of navigation personnel, while the airline's
program of chartering planes from other companies will be
phased out following the charter in January of a Boeing 747.
   The measures follow Air France Chairman Bernard Attali's
announcement in June that the company is cutting back flights
on some less-traveled routes in the face of sluggish traffic
growth.
   Air France had consolidated net profit after payments to
minority interests of 841 million francs in 1989 on revenue
of 39.6 billion francs.
