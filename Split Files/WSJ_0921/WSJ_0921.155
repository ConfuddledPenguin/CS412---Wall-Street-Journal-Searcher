   Chase Manhattan Corp. will announce today a major increase
in its reserves for problem loans and staff reductions of
more than 3,000 employees, according to banking executives.
   The announcement is aimed at clearing the air of
uncertainty about the extent of problem loans, especially in
real estate, and the ramifications of a previously announced
goal to save $300 million a year in expenses.

   Details of the plan were still being worked out yesterday
afternoon after being approved by Chase's board Wednesday.
   A Chase spokesman declined to comment, other than to say,
"We are currently finalizing plans to reduce expenses and
enhance profitability."
   James McDermott, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods, said he had been told by Chase to "be on alert" for an
announcement. "They've got to come out with something that is
hard and comprehensive here," he said. He said he is
expecting a reserve for problem loans of at least $325
million to be announced, an increase from the $250 million
added to reserves in each of the first two quarters.
   Chase's stock has been hammered all week by persistent
rumors of larger than expected problems at the bank.
Yesterday it was off 12.5 cents to $13.75 a share in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, hitting a new 52-week low
from its high of $44 last October. The rumors began after
Chase was forced to pay a rate of more than 13% to reprice
some existing bonds last week.
   A restructuring of Chase's European operations is also
expected as part of the announcement. A former executive of
the bank said it would involve "a substantial downsizing of
operations" that would result in sharp cutbacks in Chase's
retail operations there and sale of its West German banking
operation.
   An AP-Dow Jones wire report yesterday said that Chase's
Spanish bank said it would begin laying off employees as part
of a world-wide move to cut costs. Chase Manhattan Espana
employs 400 people in Spain in 14 offices and has been
showing losses.
   In London, a Chase spokesman confirmed that the company's
European retail operations are one of a number of units under
review for cost-cutting.
   In Chase's U.S. operations, analysts expect staff
reductions in the investment banking and corporate lending
sectors, which expanded in the late 1980s to participate in
corporate takeovers. "With deal flow off sharply, I expect
there will be cutbacks in those areas," said Mr. McDermott.
   It was uncertain whether Chase's announcement would
address the continuance of Chase's stock dividend at its
present level. The shares are now yielding more than 17%. A
50% cut in the dividend would save the bank more than $100
million a year but would be a blow to investors. Analysts are
divided on whether Chase would make such a drastic move.
   Analysts had been urging management to provide details of
the expected restructuring but an announcement wasn't planned
until after Oct. 1, when Thomas G. Labrecque succeeds Willard
C. Butcher as chief executive officer and a new management
team will be in place.
   When Mr. Labrecque was named to succeed Mr. Butcher in
June, he said there would be a restructuring that analysts
estimated would result in the loss of 3,000 jobs through
voluntary retirement and layoffs. An executive at the bank
says the figure will be higher than that. More than 1,500
employees have recently opted to be part of a voluntary
retirement program, exceeding the bank's goal of 1,200, the
executive said. Chase has 41,000 employees world-wide.
