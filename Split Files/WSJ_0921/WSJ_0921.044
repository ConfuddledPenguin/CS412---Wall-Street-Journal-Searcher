   THIS LITTLE CONFECTION is about Mikhail Gorbachev, the
trackless swamp that is the Soviet economy, and what the U.S.
might do to pluck him from the ooze. But first we must
digress to deal with some seemingly unrelated matters. To
wit: A single B-2 Stealth bomber is quoted at $850 million,
out the door and including tax and license, as the boys in
the lizard-skin shoes like to say over at Belchfire Motors.
   That's provided Congress surrenders to the ungovernable
lust of the Air Force and lets its generals buy some. In
light of the recent unpleasantness in burnoose territory,
it's likely Congress will be panicked into doing so, and
never mind that in the present geopolitical climate the B-2
is as useful as a handle on a crowbar.

   The current quoted price for the plane is, of course, a
fiction concocted for us proles who will have to pay the
bill. After the usual gold-plating by contractors,
subcontractors and sub-subcontractors (who will protest that
they had to jack up the price because of inflation, new
doodads demanded by the Air Force, and the unforeseen
consequences of a conjunction between Mars and Jupiter), the
B-2 will come in at more than $1 billion a copy.
   Bet the house on it. And keep that figure in mind, along
with this one: a roll of Charmin toilet paper costs 42.3
cents. What does any of this have to do with Mikhail
Gorbachev? Patience. All will become clear.
   Now, to the Soviet leader. We like him, do we not? It's
not just because he ended the Cold War, allowed his own
people to complain publicly that he is a screw-up, and is
backing us against Baghdad.
   We also like him because we recognize him; he is a
U.S.-style politician, a charismatic, flesh-pressing
speechifier in a good suit, a type with whom we are
comfortably familiar. But given the genial contempt we have
for our own politicians, is this an advantage? Yes.
   Contempt is a function of proximity, and we know Mr.
Gorbachev is too far away to foul up our lives in the same
way our own politicos have -- dropping us into S&amp;L hell,
tethering us to a national debt that has us toiling much of
the year just to finance government interest payments, and
making us watch while they bury their snouts in one
special-interest trough or another. Mr. Gorbachev enjoys all
the benefits of having a familiar style and none of the
drawbacks of having exercised it at our expense.
   Besides, if we don't help him, we might wake up one
morning and find him dispatched to dig cabbages in the
Ukraine while in his chair will be some kind of scary
throwback -- a pig-eyed, bullet-headed field marshal,
perhaps, who in a twinkling will have us out in our back
yards digging bomb shelters again. No thanks.
   So help Mr. Gorbachev we must. But how?
   The most obvious answer is to drop a few megatons of cash
on him. But we are a little short at the moment, what with
the S&amp;L thing and the Iraq-Kuwait thing and the national debt
thing and a U.S. economy that looks more and more like a
drunk falling off a tightrope.
   And even if we had the money, we ought to remember that
charisma and managerial skill are almost never found wrapped
together in the same politician. The record so far suggests
that Mr. Gorbachev, for all his charm, might lose his shirt
even if handed the monopoly franchise on cold beer in the
Sahara. We like him, but do we like him enough to throw
actual cash into the economic black hole over which he
incompetently presides? Nah.
   What, then? An alternative stunning in its simplicity
comes from Creative Solutions Associates Inc. (an outfit a
few of us cobbled up one afternoon in a local tavern that
promptly landed an SBA loan that will buy drinks for quite a
few more years). It addresses what Mr. Gorbachev really
needs, which is to get something up there on the shelves.
   His people want toasters. They cry out for toilet paper.
They want toothpaste that doesn't taste like nuclear waste.
They want VCRs and Levi's 501 jeans and meat and ketchup and
posters of Madonna, and if they don't get them pretty soon,
Mr. Gorbachev will be digging cabbages in the Ukraine.
   We have all this stuff, and under the Creative Solutions
plan we could deliver it without really spending any extra
money, at least in the way Washington understands spending.
All we have to do is not build, say, five B-2 bombers we
would have built otherwise.
   The plan: The Air Force wants 75 bombers, but after months
of posturing, it and Congress will agree on a smaller fleet.
Then, just as agreement is reached, adherents of the
Gorbachev bailout -- who have been waiting in the weeds for
this moment -- blindside everybody. They suggest that just
five fewer planes will rescue Mr. Gorbachev by allowing us to
send him, out of the $5 billion savings, any one of the
following (price research by Creative Solutions staff):
   -- 11,820,330,969 rolls of Charmin toilet paper, very
probably a full year's supply for the entire Soviet Union,
or:
   -- 1.42 million tons of ground beef, about 40 hamburger
patties for every man, woman and child, or:
   -- 2,512,562,814 tubes of family-sized Crest
tartar-control toothpaste, enough to whiten every Soviet
molar for months, or:
   -- A politically fetching package of 75 million pairs of
Levi's 501s for Soviet youth and the same number of GE
toasters for the suffering parents of same, with money left
over for other items.
   And that's all at retail. Even Congress ought to be able
to get volume discounts.
   Any legislator worth his franking privilege would snap at
this idea like a hungry trout. It gives something to
everybody without seeming to cost anything extra, and makes
all involved look like statesmen. Most important, we would
save Mr. Gorbachev by buying him precious time to get his
economic machinery running again.
   He would be grateful, and in time he would repay us. He
could send us one thing the Soviet Union still has in plenty
-- trees. (Ours have spotted owls sitting in them, and can't
be touched.) And we might even get him to take something we'd
be better off without. We could send him surplus lawyers.
Lots and lots of lawyers.
