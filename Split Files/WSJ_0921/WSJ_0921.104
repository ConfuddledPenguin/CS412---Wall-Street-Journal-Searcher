   NEW YORK -- Short interest again set a volume record on
the New York Stock Exchange, rising 5.6% for the month ended
Sept. 14, and reached a record on the American Stock Exchange
after dropping slightly a month earlier.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Varity Corp. were the short interest
leaders on the Big Board, with about 13.7 million and 12.7
million shares, respectively. However, there was relatively
little change in their total short positions. They have been
among the volume leaders for several months. Alcan Aluminium
Ltd. of Montreal, the previous month's leader with more than
16 million shares, saw short interest practically eliminated;
analysts had said the high level in August probably was
attributable to dividend-capture trading.

   New York exchange short interest rose at the Sept. 14
settlement date to 706,315,268 shares from 668,964,125 at
mid-August, which was the previous record. On the Amex, short
interest rose 2.9% to 79,572,107 shares from an adjusted
77,349,948. The month included the 21 trading days through
Sept. 7.
   At mid-September 1989, short volume was 547,377,585 shares
on the Big Board, indicating a 29% advance, and 51,911,566
shares on the Amex, indicating a 53.2% rise.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 5.16 from mid-August's 3.62. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position. Average daily New York
exchange volume for the 21 trading days was 147,279,540
shares. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has
weakened in value as an indicator because options and other
products can be used to hedge short positions.
   Among bellwether issues, Exxon Corp. saw its short
interest volume rise about 23% to 5,893,835 shares; GTE Corp.
rose 42% to 6,049,421 shares and Philip Morris Cos. more than
tripled to 4,762,377 shares after having dropped 47% the
month before.
   Prime Motor Inns remained among the Big Board short
interest leaders, at 6,138,512 shares, or almost 20% of its
shares outstanding. Earlier this week, the hotel company
filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors, and the
shares, steadily declining in recent weeks, fell to 50 cents.
They were still trading below $1 as of yesterday. A year
earlier, they were as high as $38.
