   C-Cor Electronics Inc. said it expects to report a loss
and a decline in revenue for the first quarter ending Sept.
28.
   The State College, Pa., electronics equipment maker
attributed the slowdown to a lack of orders caused by the
uncertainty in the cable television industry, which Congress
is considering reregulating. The company said it also was
hurt by the lending practices of financial institutions.
