   Helped by a strong market for heating oil, crude oil
futures reached a record high on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude for October delivery rose to $35 a barrel in
afternoon trading, the highest since trading in crude oil
futures was started in 1983, before settling at $34.71, up
$1.53 for the day.

   It was the last day of trading for the October contract, a
situation that usually brings an increase in volatility. The
November crude contract rose 45 cents a barrel to settle at
$33.42 after hitting a high of $33.60 for the day.
   Several bullish news items hit oil markets late yesterday
to contribute to the price surge. Among them were published
reports that Saudi Arabia had suspended shipments of oil to
Jordan because of nonpayment and that the World Bank had said
oil prices could reach $65 a barrel if the Middle East crisis
triggers a war. There were also belligerent statements from
Iraqi officials concerning the Persian Gulf standoff and
reports of pending interruptions at several petroleum
refineries for maintenance or repairs.
   As a result, gasoline and most other fuels also posted
sizzling gains in spot and futures prices. The gasoline
market had been weakening because of growing evidence that
demand is slackening. But yesterday, the futures price for
unleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 1.64 cents to
settle at 91.54 cents a gallon, and most other gasoline
contracts were up their limit of two cents a gallon.
   Still, the star of the markets was heating oil, which
leaped beyond gasoline in price. In U.S. futures trading,
heating oil for October delivery reached a high of 92.5 cents
a gallon before ending the day at 91.86 cents, up 3.33 cents.
The November contract was up the limit of two cents at 91.66
cents.
   The focus on heating oil, which was also responsible for a
late Wednesday rally in petroleum prices, was helped
yesterday by the National Weather Service. It predicted that
the regions that use the most fuel in the U.S. -- the
Northeast and Great Lakes states -- will have colder weather
than usual for the next few months.
   The strengthening in the U.S. market for heating oil
follows a steady firming in Europe for gasoil, as the fuel is
known there. The weather is already cool enough for heating
purposes in several parts of Europe, and some European users
of fuel oil have been "topping off" their tanks as a hedge
against possible shortages this winter resulting from the
Middle East crisis.
   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, where gasoil
is priced by the ton, the October contract settled at $286 a
ton yesterday, up $11 from Wednesday's close.
   "There is very good demand in gasoil in Europe that is
spilling over into heating oil in the U.S.," said Shahrokh
Nikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments, at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. In U.S. heating oil prices,
he said, he foresees "another eight cents to 10 cents
potential" for increases.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in relatively
light trading. Some private weather services' forecasts of
frost Sunday night across portions of the northern tier of
Midwestern states kept corn and soybean futures prices higher
for much of the session. Because a wet spring delayed
planting in many areas, the soybean and corn crops aren't as
mature at this point as they normally would be. Soybean
futures traders who sold contracts earlier in the week when
forecasters were playing down frost worries bought them back
yesterday, said Daniel Basse, director of marketing for
AgResource Co. in Chicago. But near the close of trading,
so-called local traders on the Chicago Board of Trade floor
appeared to be selling contracts to even up their holdings.
Soybean futures for November delivery closed one-half cent
lower at $6.1725 a bushel after being five cents a bushel
higher at midmorning. December corn futures closed 1.5 cents
a bushel higher at $2.2375 on frost worries and concentrated
buying from one or more big speculators, traders said.
December wheat futures slid 0.75 cent to close at $2.685 a
bushel.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices plunged to near a
three-year low in heavy selling, while gold and silver were
slightly higher. October delivery platinum ended with a loss
of $4.50 an ounce at $454.10. But it dropped as low as
$448.50, which was the lowest since $445 in February 1988.
The October contract has been declining steadily. As recently
as Aug. 21, it traded at $514. According to Bernard Savaiko,
metals analyst for Paine Webber, the major factor depressing
prices yesterday was reports of Far Eastern selling of
platinum, mostly from Japan. There was speculation that some
of the selling may have been on behalf of the Soviet Union,
the world's second-largest platinum producer and a country in
need of foreign exchange, Mr. Savaiko said. He also said
higher interest rates in Japan may have prompted dealers to
sell metal because of the rise in carrying costs. The partial
recovery in futures that trimmed the decline was attributed
to a late surge in crude oil, Mr. Savaiko said. December
delivery gold was up $2.80 an ounce at $394.20, ending just
under the day's high of $394.30 in moderate trading. December
silver edged 0.7 cent an ounce higher to $4.86.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined. The December contract
ended with a loss of two cents a pound at $1.1775. The
contract traded over a range of more than four cents, as it
rose to $1.2140 shortly after the opening, only to be hit by
renewed selling that dropped it to the day's low of $1.1720.
According to one analyst, the price rose after selling that
had been influenced by weakness in London in the previous two
sessions ran its course. Renewed selling then developed on
technical considerations, he said. Another analyst said
factors weakening prices included concern over an economic
slowdown and a possible consequent decline in copper
consumption, expectations of a rise in London Metal Exchange
warehouse stocks in a report due out today and a belief that
a miners' strike in Peru that began Aug. 17 is close to being
settled.
