   Glaxo Holdings PLC, a major British pharmaceuticals
concern, reported a 13% rise in pretax profit for the year to
June 30, with strong sales throughout the company, including
its key Zantac anti-ulcer drug.
   Glaxo's pretax profit of #1.14 billion ($2.15 million), up
from #1.01 billion a year earlier, was ahead of market
expectations which ranged between #1.08 billion and #1.13
billion.

million a year earlier. Per-share earnings were up 15% to
53.1 pence from 46.2 pence.
   Sales rose 11% to #2.85 billion from #2.57 billion, even
after exchange rate movements cut sales by #145 million,
Glaxo said.
