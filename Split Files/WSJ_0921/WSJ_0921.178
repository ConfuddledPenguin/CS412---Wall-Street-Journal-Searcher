   As expected, National Semiconductor Corp. reported a net
loss of $165.5 million, or $1.63 a share, for the first
quarter ending Aug. 26, compared with a net loss of $21.9
million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   The company's bigger losses largely reflect a previously
reported pretax charge of $143.6 million, which it took to
cover a host of reorganizing costs.

   Last month, the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker announced
that it was eliminating several product groups, closing two
assembly lines, and laying off 6.2% of its work force, or
2,000 employees.
   National Semiconductor's sales for the first period rose
to $442.7 million, from $397.6 million a year ago.
   This is the sixth net loss the company has posted in the
past eight quarters.
