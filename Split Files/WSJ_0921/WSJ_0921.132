   3Com Corp. reported that net income for the first quarter
ended Aug. 31 quadrupled, to $5 million, or 17 cents a share,

period.

   The Santa Clara, Calif., manufacturer of computer network
systems said that new products, such as its transmissions and
adapter devices, contributed to a third of sales, up from 10%
a year earlier. 3Com said the new-product sales helped to
offset weakening interest in the company's older workgroup
systems products.
