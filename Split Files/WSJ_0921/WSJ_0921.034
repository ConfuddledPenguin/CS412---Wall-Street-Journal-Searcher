   Seeing economic trouble on the horizon, Americans are
battening the hatches but aren't stricken with panic,
according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll on personal
finance and consumer attitudes.
   The results add up to a bleak outlook on the part of
consumers and small investors about several major bulwarks of
the economy and the financial markets. Fully 55% of those
polled said they believe the banking system is just somewhat
sound or not at all sound. An equal number believe
residential real estate values are stalled and will stay the
same or go down in the near future.

   Overall, half of those polled said they think the economy
will get worse in the next year, a stark increase from the
one-third who held that pessimistic view only two months ago.
In a signal that they are concerned about their own finances,
half believe that a recession would affect them directly.
   And in what looks like more bad news for beleaguered Wall
Street, 52% of respondents said they were somewhat
uncomfortable or very uncomfortable about putting money in
stocks. No other category prompted such concern, including so
speculative a play as precious metals, about which 47% said
they were somewhat or very uncomfortable, and investment real
estate, which leaves 32% uneasy. Barely more than one in 10
describe themselves as very comfortable about stocks.
   Nevertheless, Americans coming off nearly a decade of
prosperity are hardly showing signs of hysteria. Half report
that their financial assets have increased in the past five
years, and they say they are doing just what you'd expect:
drawing in purse strings, trying to save more and cutting
back on big purchases. The poll, taken over four days ending
Tuesday, surveyed registered voters only. It is one of four
quarterly surveys that take an in-depth look at a specific
subject.
   "People are worried and pulling in, but they aren't
panicking," observe pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter,
who conducted the survey for The Wall Street Journal and NBC
News. "While there is a distinct sense of hunkering down, the
fact is that these are by and large people who play it pretty
safe to begin with -- and thus still feel pretty comfortable
about their own money, despite their concerns about what is
happening in the overall economy," they say.
   For instance, despite their worries about the banking
system and the high-profile problems of the savings and loan
industry, Americans put certificates of deposit and savings
accounts at the top of the list of investments about which
they feel very comfortable or somewhat comfortable. About
eight in 10 respondents list CDs and savings accounts in
those categories.
   They're right to feel safe about those bank accounts:
Federal deposit insurance has protected all depositors up to
$100,000 per account. And they like that coverage despite the
huge $150 billion tab -- that's before interest costs -- for
the broke S&amp;L deposit insurance system they will be paying as
taxpayers. Of those polled, 52% oppose limiting depositors to
only one account insured to $100,000 (currently, depositors
can have an unlimited number in different institutions), an
idea that is in vogue on Capitol Hill these days. In a July
Journal/ NBC poll, a majority of voters opposed lowering the
$100,000 limit by 57% to 32%.
   In some other ways, however, the caution revealed in the
poll could be costly for investors. Many investment
professionals would question the respondents' deep uneasiness
about investing in stocks, at least over the long run.
   Right now, the preference for supersafe cash investments
like bank CDs is "about the right attitude, but most times
it's not," says James Solloway, director of economic research
at Argus Research Corp., a New York investment advisory firm.
"Undoubtedly, stocks are riskier than a CD, but over time you
are compensated quite nicely for taking that extra risk," he
says.
   About half of those polled say they are cutting down on
purchases and other spending, the highest level all year and
an increase from four in 10 who reported cutting back in
July. Only 10% said they are increasing spending. That was
the lowest level of the year. One-third of respondents say
they are putting off a major purchase, such as a home or a
new car, because of concerns about the economy.
   Three-quarters say they've found ways to economize in the
things they buy, and 56% have cut back on luxury items. Only
about one-third have changed vacation plans to save money,
which Messrs. Teeter and Hart take as a sign that consumers
aren't in a frenzied retreat.
   Americans do appear to be concerned about their stakes in
their homes. And they don't see real estate as a sure bet for
increasing value in the near future, as it was in many
regions over the past decade.
   Only about one-third believe they'd get more for their
house now than a year ago, while 27% think they'd get less. A
bare majority, 52%, believe this is a good time to buy a
home, while 38% believe it is not. Back in August 1986,
three-quarters said it was a good time to buy a home.
   There is not a single region where a majority believes
housing prices are on their way up. Still, regional
differences are striking. The Northeast clearly has the
biggest population of woeful real-estate value watchers. In
that region, a mere 28% of respondents see housing prices
going up. In other parts of the country, by contrast, about
45% of those polled see prices currently heading up.
   Lyle Gramley, chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, notes that home prices, as measured
by the median resale price of existing homes, rose 3% to 4%
over the past year. And he looks for "more of the same" in
the current year.
   David W. Berson, chief economist of Federal National
Mortgage Association, says that "even in deep recessions,
home prices tend to go up." That was the case, for instance,
in 1982. But he explains that one reason home prices rarely
drop is that many homeowners simply put off selling until
times are better.
   Perhaps not surprisingly, far fewer homeowners than
non-homeowners are expecting higher housing prices. Of
homeowners, 36% foresee higher prices. Of those who don't own
homes, 52% expect higher prices.
