   ASHLAND, Ky. -- Ashland Oil Inc., a diversified energy
concern, said its APAC Construction Group signed a letter of
intent to acquire a North Carolina highway and utilities
contractor.
   Terms of sale weren't disclosed. The Kitty Hawk, N.C.,
family-owned contractor, Outer Banks Contractors Inc., is
expected to have revenue of more than $40 million this year,
Ashland said. Outer Banks' senior managers have agreed to
continue in their current positions after the acquisition,
Ashland said.
