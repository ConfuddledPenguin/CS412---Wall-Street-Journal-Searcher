   From the conclusion of "The Long Pretense: Soviet Treaty
Diplomacy, 1917-1990," (Transaction Publishers, 1990) by
Arnold Beichman:

<TEXT>
   The changes for the better which take place almost daily
in the Soviet Union and on its periphery have created a
favorable world opinion toward President Mikhail Gorbachev to
a degree that no other Soviet leader, including Josef V.
Stalin during World War II, has ever enjoyed. Last year Jimmy
Carter described Gorbachev as "the most humanitarian of the
world's leaders."
