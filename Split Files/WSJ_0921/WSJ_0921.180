   BUSH'S BOOM in popularity fails to translate into
political clout.
   Fueled by continuing support for his Persian Gulf
policies, the president's job-approval rating soars to 75% in
a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. "The solid approval
of Bush on the Middle East is pulling his numbers up across
the board," say pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, who
conducted the survey.

   Three-quarters of the voters surveyed endorse Bush's
handling of foreign affairs. And he even gains slightly in
his handling of the economy: Voters approve of his
performance by 52%-36%, up from 48%-41% in July. But while
supporting him in the Gulf, lawmakers aren't afraid to defy
him on other issues, such as the defense bill.
   Influential GOP Rep. Broomfield even opposes Bush's plan
to forgive Egypt's military debts.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ DISTRACTS voters' attention from other issues, aiding
frontrunners.
   Despite the Massachusetts primary vote against
officeholders, few incumbents are trailing elsewhere.
Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman says the Mideast crisis
puts elections into suspended animation, helping candidates
who were already ahead. The Journal/NBC poll finds 37%
planning to vote for a Democrat for Congress and 32% for a
Republican, little change since July.
   One new issue from the crisis: politicians taking
oil-company contributions. And while generally backing their
own lawmakers, voters vent their anger by supporting limits
on the terms served by legislators, as Oklahoma just voted to
do; California and Colorado are expected to do the same come
November. Other issues wane. While voters would raise taxes
to pay for the drug war by 54%-39%, the ratio a year ago was
more than two to one.
                                                                                                       

   FAIR SHARES? The administration praises allies, but voters
disagree.
   U.S. officials privately express relief at the level of
allied cooperation. Extra troops pledged by Egypt and Syria
mean that Moslem ground forces may soon match the Americans
in numbers. After tripling its meager initial cash
contribution, Japan also mulls sending unarmed troops; Kohl
pledges to try to change Germany's constitution early in 1991
so he can send troops.
   But by two-to-one, voters believe other countries haven't
done their part. Japan is viewed especially harshly: Only 22%
say the Japanese have helped enough. By contrast, 44% say
Britain is doing enough, and 51% say that about Saudi Arabia.
By 56%-31%, voters support the use of military force to oust
the Iraqis from Kuwait if economic sanctions don't work
within three months.
   "There's a strong desire and demand for burden sharing,"
pollsters Hart and Teeter note. "That means the stakes for
the Japanese are high."
                                                                                                       

   QUAYLE QUALMS are exacerbated by the Iraqi crisis, the new
Journal/NBC poll suggests. In the survey, 69% of voters say
they would be uncomfortable with him as president should
something happen to Bush; only 22% would be comfortable. Even
Republicans, by 58%-33%, are uncomfortable with the thought
of a President Quayle.
                                                                                                       

   IN HARM'S WAY: A surprisingly high 73% of voters say it is
acceptable to send women on military missions where they
might get into combat. Despite a ban on direct-combat roles,
officials concede women are at risk in the Gulf in
combat-support jobs such as fixing planes.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY EXPECTATIONS: Voters in the poll are closely
divided on the likelihood of a U.S. energy shortage in the
next six months: 44% believe it likely, 48% don't. If a
shortage does occur, three out of four would try to conserve
by using less fuel for heating and cooling -- but fewer than
half are willing to resort to car pools.
                                                                                                       

   SLOW PACE: The Justice Department so far brings only three
cases under an August 1989 S&amp;L cleanup law empowering it to
seek forfeiture of certain thrift institution assets. "The
program is in its infancy," says the agency's George
Terwilliger. In the poll, 36% blame Republicans for the S&amp;L
mess; 21% fault Democrats; 17% cite both.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTER SAILS toward the Supreme Court -- and some tough
early cases.
   The Senate vote on his nomination is expected a few days
after the court convenes on Oct. 1. Though approval is all
but certain, that timetable could foul up court
deliberations. Two cases on which the justices may be closely
divided -- pertaining to school desegregation and to limiting
punitive damages -- probably would be argued before he is
sworn in.
   Another, involving the barring of women of childbearing
age from certain jobs, is to be argued the following week,
and Souter still might not be ready. If the cases end in tie
votes, they would have to be reargued later so he could break
deadlocks.
   Voters in the Journal/NBC poll endorse Souter's
confirmation by 32%-5% -- but a big majority, 58%, feels the
need to know more about him.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Blacks and whites hold almost exactly
opposite views of Bush's economic performance. Whites approve
by 54%-33%; blacks disapprove by 55%-37%. . . . Voters favor
new stars on the flag. They back admitting Puerto Rico as a
state by 49%-29% and support D.C. statehood by 50%-35%.
