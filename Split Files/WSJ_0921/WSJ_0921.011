   Change has rarely been so swift, so widespread. For
business, the new order clearly offers the potential for
incalculable prosperity.

   But it comes at a difficult juncture. For at a time when
"going global" has become a competitive necessity, the
international business landscape seems to change almost
daily.
   China, for instance, has suddenly regressed -- its image
transformed from one of stability to one of fragility and
riskiness. Eastern Europe, which a year ago seemed a backward
bulwark of socialism, is widely regarded as one of the great
economic growth areas of the 1990s. And in the Mideast, after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, oil prices turned suddenly
volatile, threatening to toss the world's economies into
recession.
   Who will survive -- and thrive -- in this new world?
   It isn't easy to predict, but one thing is clear:
Companies can't simply pretend that the rest of the world
doesn't exist. Wherever a company is based, whatever a
company makes, competition is pushing it to think globally.
Even the executives of a small Oregon company that makes
robotic-vision systems to cut french fries discovered
recently that a Belgian company had developed a similar,
competing device.
   Such competitive pressures are growing in all the world's
major markets. U.S. companies are intensifying their efforts
in Europe and Asia. European companies are pushing hard into
the U.S. and Asia. And Japanese companies, once focused
heavily on exports to the U.S., are buying and building
aggressively almost everywhere.
   The result is that companies that were primarily domestic,
or merely exporters, are becoming truly global at a furious
rate. All of which leads to far-flung operations and a much
greater degree of complexity.
   How will American companies fare in this new world? Many
U.S. companies long ago staked out beachheads overseas,
especially in Europe. They also did what few European
companies could bring themselves to do: They considered
Europe a single market. Today, as Europe hurtles toward
economic unity by the end of 1992, many American companies
are already well positioned.
   Ford Motor Co., Merck &amp; Co., Coca-Cola Co., International
Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are just a
few of the companies with strong, profitable operations in
Europe.
   In Asia, too, many U.S. companies have persevered and
prospered. McDonald's Corp. and Walt Disney Co. are among
them. Also successful are companies as diverse as Du Pont Co.
and Amway, the latter having sold more than $500 million in
housewares door-to-door in Japan last year.
   Yet there are also signs of American companies in retreat
from abroad. Some U.S. companies, including Chrysler Corp.
and Honeywell Inc., have cashed out part of their stakes in
Japan. Many U.S. banks, in particular, are withdrawing from
overseas, even from some of the fast-growing markets of Asia.
   Does this matter? It could matter greatly. Competing in
the 1990s is likely to require large amounts of long-term
investment overseas in many of the most important industries
-- in autos, in electronics, in pharmaceuticals. The
necessity to be "insiders" rather than mere exporters is
growing day by day.
   The insider status becomes particularly important should
the world economy tumble into protectionist regional trading
"blocs." If trade were to be relatively free within North
America, Europe or Asia, but relatively restricted between
blocs, then a significant presence inside each bloc would be
crucial.
   For the U.S., such a trading-block world conjures up a
nightmarish scenario: An American regional bloc could turn
out to be the debt bloc -- a collection of countries that
import capital, run big budget deficits, and invest
pathetically small amounts in new ventures.
   Fortunately, no such thing is preordained. These days, in
fact, it seems that no idea is too bold, too farfetched, to
be taken seriously. At a recent meeting at the Japan Society
in New York, management guru Peter Drucker, asked about the
likelihood of an East Asian trade bloc, responded, "If China
breaks up under regional warlords, then we'll see an East
Asian bloc."
   Two years ago, Mr. Drucker might have been laughed out of
the room. The breakup of China? Impossible.
   It no longer seems like such a radical idea.
