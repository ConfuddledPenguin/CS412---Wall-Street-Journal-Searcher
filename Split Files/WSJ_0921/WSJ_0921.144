   WASHINGTON -- Initial claims for regular state
unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 382,000
in the week ended Sept. 8, unchanged from the previous week's
level, the Labor Department said.
   The number of people receiving regular state benefits in
the week ended Sept. 1 was a seasonally adjusted 2,471,000,
or 2.4% of those covered by unemployment insurance, down from
2,546,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment
rate was also 2.4%.

   Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the
number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week
ended Sept. 1 fell to 2,138,500 from 2,319,800 a week
earlier. These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.
   Most state and federal government offices were closed
Sept. 3 for the Labor Day holiday, which may have affected
the level of initial claims during the week ended Sept. 8.
