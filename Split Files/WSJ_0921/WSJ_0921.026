   When, in 458 B.C., Aeschylus won the Athenian equivalent
of the Tony award for his "Oresteia," little did he know that
2,447 years later Thomas Berger would come along and turn
that trilogy's weighty story of passion and vengeance into a
glib, hollow novel called, of all things, "Orrie's Story"
(Little, Brown; 276 pages; $18.95), and set in an American
town shortly after World War II.
   In the original, Agamemnon, king of Argos, returns home
after the conquest of Troy only to be murdered by his wife,
Clytemnestra, who has never forgiven him for sacrificing
their daughter, Iphigenia, and who has been stepping out with
his cousin Aegisthus. A decade later, Agamemnon's son,
Orestes, prodded by his sister, Electra, avenges their
father's death by killing Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, and is
tried and acquitted by the goddess Pallas Athene.

   Given Mr. Berger's focus, in previous novels (among them
"Vital Parts" and "Changing the Past"), on backstabbing wives
and bleak ironies, his interest in a story about a war hero's
murder by his spouse is no surprise. And given his fixation
on mother-son attachment and father-son antagonism, it's no
surprise either that the Orestes figure has a full-blown
Oedipal complex.
   Indeed, it is less true to say that Mr. Berger has
"modernized" Aeschylus's dramatis personae than to say that
he has assigned their traits to slick characters who are
largely interchangeable with figures from his earlier novels.
Thus he turns Orestes into a wimpy college kid named Orrie;
Aegisthus into a mysteriously successful businessman named
E.G.; Agamemnon into a hapless chump named Augie Mencken who
pretends to have been away at war but who has in fact been
down South courting one Cassie; and the sympathetic
Clytemnestra, now a shrew named Esther who drowns Augie in
the tub for his Army insurance.
   Most of Aeschylus's people have counterparts here:
Orestes's friend Pylades becomes Paul Leeds; Apollo becomes
defense attorney Anthony Pollo; Pallas Athene becomes Judge
Thea Palliser. Very tidy and faintly witty. But whether
"Orrie's Story" is meant to be goofy or profound is hard to
say. Doubtless Mr. Berger means to underscore the
timelessness of deceit, stupidity, crassness and evil -- to
show, in other words, that the travails of the House of
Atreus are as contemporary as ever. But if his goal is valid,
his book is offhand and mechanical, its action dictated in
large part not by the temperaments of his own characters but
by the need to parallel Aeschylus. Those hungry for a
20th-century "Oresteia" would, in short, be far better off
reading Eugene O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra."

   The death of a father and the family ties that give life
meaning are subjects often explored by Paul Auster. His
arresting novel "Moon Palace" (1989) was about M.S. Fogg, a
college student who, after the death of his only relative and
substitute dad, elected to abandon himself to "the chaos of
the world," steadily spending his inheritance and forsaking
work and friends in the hope that "the world might ultimately
reveal some secret harmony to me, some form or pattern that
would help me to penetrate myself."
   Similarly, when Jim Nashe, the 32-year-old protagonist of
"The Music of Chance" (Viking, 217 pages, $18.95), is
abandoned by his wife and learns his long-lost father has
died, he quits his job -- he's a Boston fireman -- and spends
a year driving around the U.S., gradually depleting the
$200,000 his old man has left him. He enjoys his isolation,
freedom and irresponsibility, enjoys the feeling of having
"taken life into his own hands."
   His money nearly gone, Nashe meets Jack Pozzi, a young
hustler whom he stakes with his remaining assets to a poker
game with two lottery millionaires. Pozzi not only loses
everything but ends up owing the men a large sum -- a debt
that he and Nashe work off by reconstructing a medieval wall
on the men's estate. The estate is a virtual prison: Nashe
and Pozzi are fenced in, have no phone or car, and are
supervised by a man with a gun. Will they ever, we wonder, be
allowed to leave? More to the point, does Nashe really want
to leave? For he doesn't really mind his prison -- which
ironically, like his year on the road, affords him the luxury
of not having to decide what to do with his life.
   The novel is a tour de force about freedom and
imprisonment, motion and stasis, order and randomness. As in
"Moon Palace," Mr. Auster asks if the world's seeming
arbitrariness is in fact governed by some secret harmony,
some music of chance. Wittily, he works in allusions to such
esoteric sages as William of Occam and Zeno of Elea, who saw
a divergence between life and logic.
   Yet this is no drab, schematic novel of ideas. On the
contrary, it is a rich, dazzling performance -- its story
beautifully paced and shaped, its tone powerfully ominous,
its prose unfailingly limpid, supple and energetic. One keeps
waiting for Mr. Auster to misstep, but he never does. If in
"Moon Palace" this sometime player of post-modern word games
seemed to be moving toward an authentic, sharply focused
vision of the human condition, in "The Music of Chance" he
would appear to have reached his destination.
