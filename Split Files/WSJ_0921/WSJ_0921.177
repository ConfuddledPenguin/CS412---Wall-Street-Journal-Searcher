   NEW YORK -- General Electric stock has dropped 9% in a
week in heavy trading as investors fretted that the
Fairfield, Conn., giant might stub its toe in financial
services.
   The stock's decline to 55 1/8, off 1/2 yesterday, was
sparked by worry about the company's FGIC municipal bond
insurance unit. The financial woes of Philadelphia reminded
investors that municipal bond insurance isn't a theoretical
game -- the insurers might actually have to pay significant
claims in the next year or two.

   But insuring bonds is a tiny sideline for GE. A more
serious question is the outlook for General Electric Capital
Corp., GE's huge lending arm.
   Two critics, David Tice and James Grant, have recently
predicted that GE's profit growth will slow because GE
Capital isn't immune to problems besetting other big lenders.
   Mr. Tice, a green-eyeshade type stock analyst in Dallas,
struck first with a negative article in his newsletter,
Behind the Numbers. GE Capital "is essentially a large money
center bank," Mr. Tice says. "The only difference is that {GE
Capital} has no foreign loan exposure and does not take
deposits." As a lender, it is "larger than such well-known
banks as Bankers Trust, Bank of New York, J.P. Morgan and
First Chicago."
   Just like big banks, Mr. Tice says, GE Capital "has a
large exposure to commercial real estate loans, LBO
{leveraged buy-out} loans, credit-card loans and equipment
leasing."
   But the average big-bank stock trades at a puny 5 to 8
times per-share earnings. GE trades at nearly 12 times the
past year's per-share earnings, thereby matching the median
multiple on the New York Stock Exchange as calculated by
FactSet Data Systems.
   Of course, GE has plenty of other operations: power
generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives and
appliances, to name a few. But Mr. Tice believes the lending
operation is vital to GE's profit growth. As he figures it,
financial services (mainly GE Capital) accounted for about
24% of earnings -- and 31% of earnings growth -- in the past
five years.
   Meanwhile, in a recent newsletter, Mr. Grant warned of a
"likelihood of large future loan losses at GE." He said some
of GE's financial ratios have worsened since 1982.
Consolidated debt including the finance operation has risen
to 77% of equity from 30% then. Return on assets is 3.1%,
down from 8.4% then. And GE Capital contributes 21% of
earnings, compared with 11.3%. GE says Mr. Grant's ratios are
technically correct, but misleading because they combine
results for sharply different businesses. GE points out that
excluding the financial service businesses, the company has a
21% return on total capital and a 9.2% return on assets.
   The two major bond rating services both give GE Capital a
top triple-A rating, citing its ability to call on the parent
company for financial support if needed. But Mr. Grant thinks
this reasoning is a bit circular, noting that GE Capital
"itself has contributed an ever larger share to the parent's
net income" and hence "is an important source of the very
strength that it may one day seek to lean against."
   Lawrence Bossidy, vice chairman of GE, says, "We are
confused why these people seem to be concerned." Taking a
break from a quarterly meeting with GE managers, he says in
an interview that the updates presented at the Wednesday
meeting confirmed previous projections that GE's financial
services business will post "double digit" growth for 1990.
   GE Capital earnings grew 20% in the first half, he said,
and should increase 15% to 20% in the second half: "We are on
target to meet our 1990 goals." GE as a whole also should
report a double-digit increase in earnings, he said.
   "Obviously {GE Capital is} in a turbulent industry," the
executive says, referring to real estate and LBO lending.
"But we are not in the same business as the banks." He said
GE Capital is a major factor in equipment rental, and its
portfolio is different and has "higher returns" than
traditional bank lending.
   Turmoil in the commercial real-estate market won't affect
GE as badly as it does the banks, he adds. GE doesn't lend on
the basis of asset value, "we lend on the value of income
from properties." All of GE's commercial real-estate loans
are to income-producing properties, he says, and 80% of these
loans are for office buildings and apartments. "We don't have
any land-development loans, construction loans or condominium
loans."
   Mr. Bossidy said he expects "some increases" in real
estate losses this year, but adds: "No way will they impact
GE Capital's overall operations." Commercial real estate
accounts for 14% of GE Capital's roughly $64 billion
portfolio.
   Leveraged buy-out loans account for another 14% of GE
Capital's portfolio. Mr. Bossidy says GE Capital had equity
positions in 75 companies at the end of last year. He
acknowledges that the value of the equity warrants GE holds
has decreased recently, but declines to give an estimate.
Such warrants are valued on GE's books at between $750
million and $1 billion.
   Could the financial unit hobble the parent's earnings
outlook in the near future? Mr. Bossidy says, "As best as I
can tell, that's not going to happen."
   Certainly, analysts at Wall Street brokerage houses don't
seem worried. According to Zacks Investment Research, 15 of
17 analysts with opinions on GE rate it a buy. The other two
call it a hold.
   David Gardner at Nomura Research in June downgraded his
opinion to "near-term hold and long-term attractive" from
"short- and long-term buy," in part because the stock was "at
a premium." Mr. Gardner also trimmed his per-share earnings
estimate for the year by 10 cents, to $4.90. But he says GE's
loans are "well diversified" by business and region, adding
that because GE operates in so many diverse businesses "they
have a leg up over banks in terms of analyzing credit risks."
   Mark Altman, a PaineWebber analyst, rates GE stock
"attractive" and thinks concerns about GE Capital are
overblown. He points to strong order backlogs in such
businesses as GE's power generation equipment, medical
diagnostic equipment and aircraft engines. He says rising
productivity is driving profit margins higher and estimates
1990 share earnings at $4.90, up from $4.36 last year.
   Money managers seem to fret a bit more, but not too much.
According to CDA Investment Technologies, more than 700 large
money managers own some 447 million shares of GE stock, but
they sold, on balance, four million shares in the second
quarter.
   The stock, after hitting a high of 75 1/2 in July, has
sunk 27%. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
down about 16% from its July peak.
   NWQ Investment Management in Los Angeles sold 203,000 GE
shares in the second quarter, keeping 519,000, according to
government filings. James Owen, a managing director with NWQ,
says GE is a "high quality core holding" for individual
investors, but may face some problems near term from GE
Capital, the Kidder Peabody brokerage subsidiary and the NBC
television network.
   Money managers, he says, are subject to "quarterly
paranoia" as pension clients judge their performance every
three months, so they have to be concerned about the short
term. "The individual investor is free of that," he says, and
can afford to focus on GE's long-term virtues, such as
diversification, emphasis on exports and "wonderful
management."
   Arnold Investment Counsel in Milwaukee sold all of its
238,000 GE shares in May and June. David R. Aushwitz,
president, says his firm bought the shares in 1988, paying
about 45 apiece, and sold at about 65 as the firm trimmed its
overall stockholdings for fear of an "unkind" market. Mr.
Aushwitz said concern about the status of loans made by GE
Capital was "a small factor, but nonetheless a factor."
