   FIRST SEISMIC Corp., a Denver-based marketer of seismic
data, said it is offering one million common shares in its
initial public offering at $9 each. All of the shares are
being offered by the company. Selling stockholders have
granted the underwriters an option to purchase as many as an
additional 150,000 shares to cover over-allotments. Net
proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt,
finance new seismic surveys and purchase seismic data, and
for working capital and general corporate purposes. Rotan
Mosle Inc. is the managing underwriter of the offering.
