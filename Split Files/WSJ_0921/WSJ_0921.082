   DALLAS -- Hallwood Group Inc. said Judge Thelton E.
Henderson of the U.S. District Court of Northern California
has informed the company that he has no jurisdiction to hear
a motion by a third party that filed suit to block a proposed
limited partnership consolidation plan offered by a Hallwood
affiliate.
   The motion involves a proposal by Hallwood Realty Partners
to consolidate 11 limited partnerships sponsored by Equitec
Financial Group into a single partnership. The proposal calls
for an exchange of the interests in the 11 partnerships for
newly issued interests in a single partnership. The motion
was sought as part of a class action suit filed by Robert
Greathouse, who alleged fraud and various securities laws
violations, the company said.

   As previously announced, Hallwood Realty Partners has
received consents representing about 82% of the total
exchange values of the 11 Equitec partnerships, thus meeting
minimum participation conditions for the proposed
consolidation. Equitec and its affiliate, Equitex Properties
Co., have filed a joint motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of California seeking authorization
to complete the consolidation. A hearing is scheduled for
Oct. 19.
