   NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc., facing a slump in
its core business, is seeking profit from a source farther
afield: the debt of developing nations.
   The big securities firm said it launched a unit for
developing-country debt and hired several veteran Wall Street
executives to run it. It said the unit will focus on trading
and securitization of the debt as well as public and private
financing in developing countries.

   The market for developing-country debt, while volatile and
risky, also has profit potential. Lehman Brothers' Developing
Country Debt Index, which tracks the value of the commercial
bank debt outstanding of 11 nations with a face amount of
nearly $250 billion, rose 7.8% in this year's first half.
   To help run the new unit, Morgan Stanley brought in a
group of executives led by Jay H. Newman who established a
similar unit at Dillon, Read &amp; Co., in 1989. Mr. Newman and
Keith Fogarty will join Morgan Stanley as managing directors;
others in the group include Pierre Biraben, John Foley, Peter
Grossman and Gordon Wood. The unit will become part of Morgan
Stanley's fixed-income division.
   Morgan Stanley is active in privatization of state-owned
companies in Europe, Latin America and Asia, and its asset
management division runs several developing-country stock
funds. In July, the company posted a 48% drop in
second-quarter earnings, reflecting significant drops in its
core investment-banking and merchant-banking operations.
