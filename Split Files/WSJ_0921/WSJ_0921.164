   Guinness PLC, the British brewing and drinks group, said
pretax profit jumped 31% in the first half of the year,
beating both analysts' and the company's expectations for the
period.
   Guinness's rise in pretax profit to #322 million ($606.8
million) from #246 million a year earlier outperformed the
market's expectations of between #306 million and #310
million.

   Profit after taxes, minority interests and preference
dividends rose 31% to #201 million from #154 million a year
earlier. Earnings per share rose 30% to 21.9 pence from 16.9
pence.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders nearly trebled to
#201 million from #69 million. There were no extraordinary
items in the latest period, but a year-earlier extraordinary
loss of #85 million helped flatter the comparison. The loss
related to a payment to shareholders stemming from the
illegal share-support mechanism used during the company's bid
for United Distillers in 1986.
   Guinness increased the interim dividend by 23% to 5.4
pence from 4.4 pence a year earlier.
   Sales rose 20% to #1.52 billion from #1.26 billion the
previous year.
