   FOR MANY YEARS, a business investment in China mirrored
riverboat gambling: a lousy today, not much of a yesterday --
but what a glorious tomorrow it would be when Lady Luck
finally changed.
   Foreign businesses had to endure inefficient workers,
constantly changing regulations and interminable negotiations
with an impenetrable bureaucracy. For that honor, they paid
top dollar for nearly everything. But it was worth it: With
China rapidly shedding its socialist past, good times were
always thought to be right around the corner.

   Then came Tiananmen Square.
   Today, for the first time in nearly a decade, the future
seems so far off that it's the present that counts. As a
result of the political, moral and economic crisis sparked by
the government crackdown and killings in the nation's capital
last year, "the perception of the China market has altered
dramatically," says William Abnett, executive director of the
Washington State China Relations Council, a trade group.
"Tiananmen's biggest impact was to dash the hope of China
becoming reformist, of becoming capitalist."
   Few companies are throwing in the towel yet. Most are
hunkering down, nurturing the projects at hand. Nearly
everyone still sings the praises of the "long-term view."
   But these days, more companies are evaluating their China
operations for what they are, not for what they might become.
That, they concede, is what they should have been doing all
along. They're counting costs, driving harder bargains and
picking partners carefully. And they're taking a second look
at their China strategy in the cold light of opportunities
available elsewhere in Asia -- or in newly beckoning Eastern
Europe. What's more, those who shouldn't be there in the
first place are staying home.
   "The balloon is out of the China bubble," says Martin
Weill, director of business advisory services for the
U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group. "Maybe it should
have been out sooner." Jerome Cohen, a New York attorney who
advises clients on doing business in China, agrees. "Now you
find very few people who are dewy-eyed about China. They come
in more clear-eyed, more explicitly comparative" with other
opportunities.
   American business's love affair with China has always been
an on-again, off-again romance. Little wonder: In a centrally
controlled economy, a change of heart at the top can produce
breathtaking about-faces in business opportunities. In 1985,
for example, the Chinese turned on the credit spigot, and the
number of foreign-venture agreements jumped 40%. By 1986, the
government had clamped down, and the number plunged again by
half.
   Such changes proved frustrating. Still, China kept making
tempting progress toward what many believed would be a brave
new world. The country was establishing a legal structure,
moving toward resolving vexing foreign-exchange problems and
focusing its own agenda more clearly.
   By far the biggest comfort for companies was the
perception of vibrant leadership at China's helm. Deng
Xiaoping had installed Party Secretary Hu Yaobang and Premier
Zhao Ziyang -- a pragmatic, Western-leaning team. "I
personally met with Deng and with Zhao Ziyang," says James A.
McClung, FMC Corp.'s vice president, international. "Their
philosophy was right . . . and the way they were directing
people was correct. You couldn't help but be impressed."
   People willingly suppressed their skepticism of a few
years earlier. "Basically we found that no one was prepared
for the extent and seriousness of political and social
unrest," says Michael Griem, a consultant with A. T. Kearney
Inc. who advises companies on projects in China. Agrees Mr.
McClung: "We never realized the underlying problems until
Tiananmen Square."
   Today Hu Yaobang is gone, his death the force that set in
motion the demonstrations leading to the government crackdown
last year. Zhao Ziyang is in political exile. Conservative
elders appear to be wresting power from Deng Xiaoping. And no
new generation of leaders is evident. Behind the repression
simmer palpable feelings of public resentment and violence.
The next few years are unpredictable.
   Absent the aura of progress, the underlying reality looks
grimmer. Just before the events of June 1989, Mr. Griem of A.
T. Kearney found companies grappling with a litany of
problems. Raw materials were hard to find, costs were higher
than expected, managing ventures required more executive time
than planned, government involvement in joint ventures was
growing, and labor was less efficient than anticipated.
Still, many companies were forging ahead, often pressed by an
enthusiastic Chinese government. U.S. foreign investment in
China was soaring.
   Since Tiananmen Square, companies are addressing those
problems more directly, and new foreign investment has ground
to a near halt. Here are some of the things they are doing.
                                                                                                       

   Seeking alternative sources of supply: Mr. Abnett of the
Washington state trade group was recently asked to brief a
major retailing company that bought large quantities of
clothing from China. That company, he says, is now trying to
diversify its supply sources. So are others. According to Mr.
Griem at A. T. Kearney, companies now realize the fragility
of the Chinese supply line. "China is still a valuable
source," says Mr. Griem, "but if you miss the Christmas
season, then Christmas is over. Where China may have had an
opportunity to be the predominant source, what's ended up is
China is now a good source, but not the only one."
                                                                                                       

   Negotiating longer-term ventures: In general, Westerners
wanted very long-term ventures to give them adequate time to
amortize start-up costs, says A. J. Robinson, executive vice
president of Portman Overseas Inc. The Atlanta-based
real-estate company is a partner in a $200 million complex in
Shanghai. But the Chinese pushed for short-term ventures and
fast returns. Mr. Robinson says Tiananmen Square strengthens
Westerners' hands in seeking longer terms for ventures. His
company is looking to tack a few years on its term.
                                                                                                       

   Resisting pressure: Many companies found themselves
pressured by the Chinese to expand in ways that weren't
economically feasible. Eager to develop their remote interior
regions, the Chinese pressed companies to join ventures
there. They wanted Honeywell Inc. "to move into the interior
and set up a medium-tech industrial-instrumentation joint
venture," says Michael Bonsignore, the company's president,
international. "Even on cursory inspection, there was no way
the local infrastructure . . . could support it. We became
part of China's efforts to build an infrastructure. It wasn't
a pragmatic idea."
   Now, he says, Honeywell is back in the driver's seat.
"Those discussions regarding local manufacture have really
gone quiet," he says. "It gives Honeywell an opportunity to
decide what makes sense in terms of the long term. Before, we
were being pressured."
                                                                                                       

   Shifting strategies: Some companies' China game plans
contained more than a little wishful thinking. In particular,
some joined Chinese ventures simply hoping for access to one
billion potential consumers. The post-Tiananmen reality is
forcing a re-evaluation. James Stepanek, a visiting lecturer
at Yale University's management school and until recently a
Beijing representative of a Fortune 500 company, cites one
company's switch: "They are viewing China now less as a
market and more as a factory" producing goods for export.
"That's a fundamental change."
   On the other hand, companies such as FMC that started by
marketing products to China are re-evaluating their plans to
make things there. "We were focusing on doing things in the
country. Now we will shift {back} to a marketing strategy,"
says FMC's Mr. McClung. What's more, companies that had
planned to expand existing ventures have grown more cautious:
"The big-ticket investment is going to be pushed way
downstream," says Mr. Griem.
                                                                                                       

   Cutting costs: Mr. Cohen's law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkin,
Wharton &amp; Garrison, recently closed its Hong Kong office,
which specialized in China business. It distributed the
reduced workload among staff in Beijing, Manila, New York and
Washington. "It's a more efficient, less expensive way of
getting through a period that could last a number of years,"
says Mr. Cohen. Others are pressing the Chinese to reduce
costs that the foreign businesses readily acceded to in
happier times. "In the past {the foreigners} would say, OK,
we'll just pay this," says Mr. Robinson of Portman. "Now
foreign partners are going to try to drive a better bargain.
You're crazy if you don't."
