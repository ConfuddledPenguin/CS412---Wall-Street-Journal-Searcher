   The Internal Revenue Service and the Newhouse family have
reached a final settlement in what is believed to be the
biggest ever estate-tax dispute.
   Under terms of the settlement, which was entered Sept. 5
in U.S. Tax Court in Washington, the Newhouse family will pay
$46.4 million in taxes on the estate of S.I. Newhouse Sr.,
who died in 1979. That amount is about $2 million more than
called for in a ruling in the case last February by Tax Court
Judge B. John Williams Jr.

   But the settlement, culminating an 11-year battle, still
is a blow to the IRS, which had sought $609 million in estate
taxes and another $305 million in penalties from the Newhouse
family. The settlement means that the IRS won't appeal Judge
Williams's decision, which upheld the Newhouse family's
valuation of the stockholdings in the estate of the late
publishing magnate.
   S.I. Newhouse Sr. founded Advance Publications Inc. and
built it into the nation's largest privately held media
fortune. The Newhouse empire includes 26 newspapers and
publishing gems such as the Conde Nast magazines, Random
House book publishers and The New Yorker, which was acquired
after Mr. Newhouse's death.
   During a long trial that began in January 1989, the agency
was badly outgunned. Judge Williams threw out most of the
government's expert testimony on the stock valuation, which
was based on the breakup value of Mr. Newhouse's individual
holdings at the time of his death.
   For its part, the Newhouse family produced an all-star
cast of witnesses -- including industry rivals such as Rupert
Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., and Douglas McCorkindale,
vice chairman of Gannett Co. -- as well as an array of Wall
Street investment bankers and lawyers.
   As part of the settlement, the Newhouse family will pay
off the remainder of its deferred estate-tax liability, or
$12.9 million, now rather than pay it annually through 1995
as allowed under IRS rules.
   The IRS also agreed to apply the same method in evaluating
Advance stock owned by Mr. Newhouse's widow, Mitzi, who died
in 1989, and his brother Norman, who died in 1988. But the
per-share value of their stock will be greater because of
substantial growth and appreciation in the value of the
family's media properties in the 1980s.
   Albert Turkis, one of the family's Washington attorneys,
said the settlement was "consistent with the understanding of
the Newhouse family" on the value of the stock. "The
settlement provides an objective and consistent method of
valuing the shares. . . . without the risk or necessity of
costly and protracted litigation," he added.
   Robert Shilliday, the IRS's special trial attorney, and
Joseph Baniewicz, an IRS financial analyst who also worked on
the case, could not be reached for comment.

   WARNER ADVANCES in a dispute with widow of author Richard
Wright.
   A federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Warner Books
Inc.'s 1988 biography of Mr. Wright -- best-known for his
books "Native Son" and "Black Boy" -- wasn't a copyright
infringement although it paraphrased or quoted several
unpublished works by Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright died in 1960; his
copyrights are owned by his widow, Ellen Wright.
   The decision, if upheld on appeal, could help shape the
law on when and how unpublished works may be used. Previous
court rulings -- including a federal appeals court decision
in Manhattan about the work of J.D. Salinger in 1987 -- have
limited the material that can be used in biographies.
   Mrs. Wright contended in her lawsuit that the book,
"Richard Wright, Daemonic Genius," violated copyrights to
published and unpublished works by her late husband. At the
heart of the suit are unpublished letters that Mr. Wright
sent to Margaret Walker, author of the biography, in the
1930s.
   Federal Judge John Walker agreed with the Time Warner unit
that Prof. Walker's use of the material was "fair use" under
the copyright law. Judge Walker, a federal appeals-court
judge in Manhattan, was designated to handle the case at the
district-court level.
   In the Salinger case, a federal appeals court in Manhattan
ruled that unpublished works "normally enjoy complete
protection against copying any protected expression."
   But Judge Walker ruled that the appellate decision didn't
ban the use of unpublished material in all cases. For
instance, Judge Walker said, there is no copyright violation
if the unpublished work is used to convey facts, rather than
creative style. Judge Walker added that Prof. Walker "has
used the letters not to recreate Wright's creative
expression, but simply to establish facts necessary to her
biography."
   Mark Fowler, an attorney for Warner and for Prof. Walker,
praised the decision. "A biographer can't practice his craft
unless he can use some unpublished, primary sources," Mr.
Fowler said, adding: "This decision gives biographers some
breathing room in the wake of the earlier decisions."
   Andres Valdespino, an attorney for Mrs. Wright, couldn't
be reached for comment.

   INSURER, BEVERAGE CONCERN battle over attorney fees, legal
costs.
   Dr Pepper Co., a unit of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos., is suing
Harbor Insurance Co. for reimbursement of attorneys' fees and
other costs incurred in defending itself against several
shareholder suits settled in 1984. The case is raising an
increasingly common dispute about the boundaries of
directors' and officers' liability-insurance coverage.
   The shareholder suits had been brought against Dr Pepper
and its directors, challenging a plan under which Dr Pepper
was taken private in a leveraged buy-out. The suits were
settled for about $375,000. Dr Pepper paid the settlement,
plus defense legal fees of $265,000, then sought
reimbursement under a directors' and officers' liability
policy issued by Harbor, a New York-based company.
   Underlying the dispute in this and similar cases is the
fact that standard policies, such as the one Harbor issued,
generally provide coverage for officers and directors, but
not for the company that employs them. However, shareholder
lawsuits increasingly name the company and individuals as
defendants. And because the defendants often are represented
by the same legal counsel -- for strategic and economic
reasons -- it's frequently hard to separate the relative
costs of defending them.
   "It's a hot topic," says Kenneth Wollner, a consultant in
the Chicago office of Wyatt Co., an actuarial and consulting
firm.
   When Harbor and Dr Pepper couldn't agree on an allocation
of the costs, Dr Pepper filed suit in state district court in
San Antonio, Texas, alleging breach of contract and duty of
good faith. Harbor has denied the charges. The trial is
scheduled to begin Dec. 3.

   JURY WAS TAINTED by publicity in thrift case, judge rules.
   Federal Judge Robert B. Maloney of Dallas set aside the
convictions of two Dallas men because jurors in the case
discussed the indictment of Don R. Dixon, former owner of
Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas.
   The indictment was released during the trial of Mr.
Dixon's former accountant, Wellington O. Rothwell, and the
accountant's real-estate partner, Rosswell H. Westmoreland,
on tax-fraud charges related to loans from Vernon Savings.
Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland were convicted less than
two weeks after the indictment.
   Mr. Dixon's name had been mentioned frequently in the
trial, and several jurors conceded that they had discussed
Mr. Dixon's indictment during their deliberations after
learning of it through the news media. In an order filed
earlier this week, Judge Maloney said the possibility of
prejudice against Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland justified
a new trial for the two men.
   The judge's ruling damps the Justice Department's campaign
for publicity about its thrift-fraud cases. The department
has been criticized in Congress for responding too slowly to
thrift fraud, and has responded by issuing news releases in
Washington to announce thrift-fraud cases. Some big cases are
announced at full-blown news conferences.
   The Justice Department had canceled its plans for a news
conference to announce Mr. Dixon's indictment on June 13
after defense attorneys for Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland
raised questions about the possible effect on jurors.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas said the Justice
Department and Internal Revenue Service will consider
appealing.
   "We fully intend to retry the case in the event the order
becomes final," he said, adding: "I would consider this a
bump in the road for us."

   UNITED AIR WINS ROUND in row with American Air over
Chicago's skies.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington refused to issue
an emergency stay barring implementation of a planned Oct. 1
schedule shift by United at Chicago's O'Hare airport.
American, an AMR Corp. unit, had requested the stay.
   The ruling means that UAL Corp.'s United unit can schedule
certain evening departures prior to American flights. The
decision upholds a Federal Aviation Administration decision
last week. The FAA says United's changes will cut delays and
ease air-traffic workloads.
   The new schedule takes effect Oct. 1 and is scheduled to
expire Jan. 15, 1991.
   United called the court's ruling a "a victory for the
traveling public." American said it intends to challenge the
schedule.
   But the court decision may render moot any American
challenge because it is unlikely a new ruling will be issued
before United introduces its new winter schedule.

   ADULT-FILM DISTRIBUTOR PROTESTS federal indictment in
Utah.
   Adam &amp; Eve, a North Carolina distributor of sexually
oriented materials, was indicted yesterday by a federal grand
jury in Utah for mailing allegedly obscene films and
magazines and related advertisements. The indictment, based
on mailings in 1986, is part of Project Postporn, a federal
crackdown on mail-order distributors of adult films and
publications.
   Adam &amp; Eve contended that the Utah prosecution was aimed
at derailing the company's earlier civil lawsuit against the
Justice Department, which accuses the government of trying to
bully the company out of business. The company's pending
lawsuit alleges that prosecutors have threatened to file
multiple obscenity cases in several far-flung jurisdictions
unless Adam &amp; Eve closes down.
   Bruce Ennis, a lawyer for Adam &amp; Eve, asserted that the
Utah indictment "is clearly in retaliation for the civil
lawsuit, in which we are finding extraordinary admissions of
bad faith" by federal officials.
   A Justice Department spokesman denied Mr. Ennis's
accusation, but said that department lawyers plan to seek a
stay in the civil suit until the criminal charges are
resolved.
