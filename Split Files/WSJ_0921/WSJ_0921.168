   Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries PLC and Center Parcs N.V.
said they are in talks that could lead to the British concern
buying the Center Parcs shares it doesn't already own.
   Scottish &amp; Newcastle, a brewing and leisure concern,
purchased a 60.3% interest in Center Parcs a year ago for
#218 million ($410.8 million). It said it may purchase the
remaining 39.7% for about #180 million.

   The original purchase agreement prohibited Scottish &amp;
Newcastle from bidding for the rest of Center Parcs for three
years so that the Dutch leisure group could keep its
identity. The agreement said Center Parcs would maintain a
listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
   Center Parcs, which currently operates 12 holiday villages
in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the U.K., said it now
considers its identity "securely established" and believes
its business could be more successfully expanded as a wholly
owned subsidiary.
   Separately, Center Parcs said pretax profit for the first
half of 1990 rose 35% to 34.8 million Dutch guilders ($19.7
million), while sales gained 24% to 376.3 million guilders.
