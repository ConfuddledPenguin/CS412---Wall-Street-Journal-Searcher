   DALLAS -- Halliburton Co. said it would increase its 1990
capital budget for property, plant and equipment by 11%, to
$395 million from $355 million. The increase marks the second
time this year that the company has raised its 1990 spending
budget.
   The oil services concern said that more than 80% of the
current budget of $395 million is allocated to its oil field
services group. The group's capital needs have increased in
response to growing demand for a variety of its services,
Halliburton said.
