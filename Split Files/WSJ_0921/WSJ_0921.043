   TOKYO -- Kobe Steel Ltd. will provide Austria's
Voest-Alpine Stahl Linz G.m.b.H. with technology to produce a
corrosion-resistant steel used by the automobile industry,
the Japanese company said.
   With this technology, Voest-Alpine could meet the steel
requirements of Japanese auto makers that are expanding into
Europe, a Kobe spokesman said.

   The two companies signed a three-year agreement in Linz,
Austria, for Kobe to supply the technology and to guide the
Austrian company in making the so-called Hi-Super DN steel.
   Voest-Alpine is the fourth European company to receive
technical assistance from Japanese companies in making
corrosion-resistant steel for auto makers, the Kobe spokesman
said. The Austrian company is Europe's eighth-largest steel
producer, with output of 4.5 million metric tons of crude
steel last year. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.
