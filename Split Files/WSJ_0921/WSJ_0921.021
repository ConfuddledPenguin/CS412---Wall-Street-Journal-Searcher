   FRANKFURT -- Schering AG said it acquired the cancer and
biotechnology research divisions of Shell Oil Co., the U.S.

   Terms weren't disclosed, but a Schering spokeswoman said
the purchase was a cash deal.
   The acquisition from Shell only affects the research and
development divisions of Triton, based in Alameda, Calif.,
Schering said. The company said the acquisition will widen
its research in cancer therapy and strengthen its
biotechnology activities.
   Triton's Leukemia compound Fludara I.V. recently received
a recommendation of approval from the advisory committee of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Schering said.
