   Smit Internationale N.V. reported a loss for the first
half of 1990 of 7.2 million guilders ($4.1 million), a slight
narrowing from the 8.6 million loss posted in the
year-earlier period.
   However, the Dutch salvaging company projected that
earnings for the year would at least equal its 1989 net
profit of 4 million guilders.

<TEXT>
   Smit said operating profit improved to 18 million guilders
from 1.0 million guilders, but earnings were affected by
losses incurred by associated companies in which Smit has
holdings.
