   WASHINGTON -- Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke
said he expected New England real-estate markets to continue
to deteriorate and that it "will affect the banks."
   Mr. Clarke, speaking to reporters, didn't say how much
further he expected the New England real-estate markets to
erode or how much it would cost the banks. But he said it was
"clear these markets are not going to bounce back fast and
high."

   In general, the comptroller said, "1990 will not be a good
year for bank profitability and asset quality" because of
real-estate loans and other problem loans related to the
slowing economy. He added that the outlook for next year
remained unclear.
   Mr. Clarke said his agency remained concerned about
real-estate loan practices. Though he has been urging bankers
to be cautious in their lending, Mr. Clarke said that federal
regulators in special audits have continued to find faulty
appraisals, inadequate management supervision of loans, and
loans with little or no borrower equity.
   Separately, Mr. Clarke said the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. is looking over data on how the proposed increase of
insurance premiums paid by banks would affect the banking
industry. He said there is at least a possibility that
premiums could be increased above the proposed 19.5 cents per
$100 of deposits per year if the FDIC is given the authority
by legislation.
   The House has passed such legislation, and the Senate is
expected to take up the matter soon.
