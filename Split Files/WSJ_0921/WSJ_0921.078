   LISBON -- The government announced Thursday it was
revising the legal status of Portugal's largest commercial
bank in preparation for its privatization.
   Banco Portugues do Atlantico will be transformed from a
purely state company into a public limited company in which
the state will remain the only shareholder. The eventual
privatization of BPA is scheduled to be held in three stages.
The first sale of 33% of shares expected before the end of
this year.
