   The California Public Employees Retirement System, the
nation's largest public pension fund, completed a
problem-prone search to hire its first outside
money-management firms owned by minorities and women.
   Trustees of the $56 billion California system, known as
Calpers, selected 12 "small and emerging" stock investment
firms, including five Hispanic-owned firms, two each owned by
women, blacks and Asians, and one owned by a manager with
multiple sclerosis.

   Some of the firms named had owners in two categories. Two
managers were chosen on grounds that they were small, even
though they weren't owned by minorities or women. Candidate
firms were limited to having assets under management of
between $20 million and $500 million, compared with Calpers'
normal minimum of $500 million in assets for its outside
managers.
   How much money Calpers, based in Sacramento, Calif., will
allot to each winning firm to manage will be decided next
month. But the amount is expected to total several hundred
million dollars, making the search the largest ever to hire
women and minority money managers. Last July, Calpers' sister
fund, the California State Teachers Retirement System,
awarded $150 million to three minority-owned money managers.
   The Calpers search sparked an uproar in June as the
original 29 finalists for the business didn't include any
black-owned firms. Because of a scoring system later
scrapped, all four of the black-owned money-management firms
in the field of 85 candidates had been eliminated as
finalists by the Calpers staff and two minority and
women-owned consulting firms helping in the search.
   Critics argued that the absence of black finalists
defeated a major reason for the search. In addition, several
black-owned firms have been hired by big pension funds,
indicating that there were black candidates qualified to
reach the Calpers finals.
   Rather than scrap the search, Calpers trustees took the
highly unusual step of interviewing all 85 candidates during
the summer. Of the 12 winning managers, five weren't among
the original 29 finalists, meaning they won the Calpers
business after the new round of interviews with Calpers
trustees.
   Firms selected by the Calpers trustees are:
   Amerindo U.S. Advisors, Larkspur, Calif.; Brown Capital
Management, Baltimore; CIC Asset Management Inc., Beverly
Hills, Calif.; First Capital Advisors, New York; Oak
Associates, Akron, Ohio; Spare, Tengler, Kaplan &amp; Bischel
Inc., San Francisco; Systematic Financial Management, Fort
Lee, N.J.; Taplin, Canida &amp; Habacht Inc., Tiffany Capital
Advisors, San Ramon, Calif.; Valenzuela Capital Management,
New York; Denis Wong &amp; Associates, Honolulu; and Valuequest
Ltd., Marblehead, Mass.
