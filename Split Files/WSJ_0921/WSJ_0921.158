   WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
suggested that a capital-gains tax cut be separated from any
deficit-reduction plan and combined into a package with
Democratic spending initiatives.
   The Kansan, who outlined his two-track legislative
strategy yesterday, also met with seven other top-level
congressional and White House negotiators for a third day in
the Capitol to try to break the months-long budget impasse.
Although Sen. Dole's proposal was resisted by the White House
and some conservative Republicans, it could presage some type
of solution that removes the most contentious issues from the
deficit-reduction package. At the very least, it illustrated
the personal frustration of Sen. Dole, who has traditionally
given deficit reduction a higher priority than tax cuts.

   Though an official Democratic response wasn't immediately
available, top staffers reacted coolly. Sen. Dole's plan
would pair some of Democrats' top priorities, including a
child-care initiative, with the capital-gains tax rate cut
that they oppose as a boon to the rich. Any increased
spending or lost revenue in the package would have to be
offset with new taxes or budget cuts, under what he called a
"pay-as-you-go" proposal.
   Sen. Dole said this legislation would be considered
separately from a $50 billion deficit-reduction plan that
negotiators are trying to assemble, but that passage of one
is contingent on passage of the other.
   The negotiators, who are to meet again today, are
struggling to reach an agreement before the new fiscal year
begins Oct. 1. Their goal is to reduce the federal budget
deficit, estimated at more than $250 billion in fiscal 1991,
by $50 billion in the coming fiscal year and $500 billion
over five years.
   In the meantime, however, both parties are maneuvering to
confront the consequences of failure. Republicans express
growing confidence that they can kill any effort to delay
billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts that would
take effect after Oct. 1 unless a budget accord is reached.
They are encouraging President Bush to veto a postponement of
the cuts, as a way of keeping pressure on budget negotiators.
   Democratic House leaders have discussed including a delay
provision as part of a short-term spending bill that will
probably be needed to finance the government for the first
weeks of the new fiscal year. Some Democrats suggest a veto
strategy could backfire, saddling Republicans with the blame
for the automatic cuts just weeks before the election.
   Among the Democrats' latest proposals is a provision that
would raise $12 billion over five years from the nation's
banks by increasing the premium charged for deposit
insurance. The premium would rise to 27 cents per $100 of
deposits in 1992. Federal regulators already have proposed
raising the premium to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits next
year.
   Some, however, question the appropriateness of raising
premiums at a time when bank profits are narrowing. According
to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the higher premium
would further tighten profits, pushing a few shaky
institutions over the edge. Furthermore, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits, can raise
premiums only to protect its insurance fund against existing
or projected future losses.
   The proposal was added to the latest Democratic budget
offer on Monday, just hours after the House approved a bill
that would do away with the limit on what the FDIC can charge
for insurance.
   A similar bill is pending in the Senate, and the Bush
administration yesterday introduced its own bill designed to
allow the FDIC to raise bank insurance premiums. The
administration plan differs slightly from the House version,
removing mandatory rebates for banks if the insurance fund
reaches a certain level. It also would allow the FDIC to
borrow from the Federal Financing Bank, which provides money
for such agencies as the Postal Service.
