   A.G. Edwards Inc., citing increased amortization
associated with a recent move to new quarters, said net
income slipped 11% in the second quarter, despite a 9.2% rise
in revenue.
   In the quarter ended Aug. 31, the St. Louis
retail-brokerage holding company had net of $15.3 million, or
67 cents a share, down from the year-earlier period's $17.3
million, or an adjusted 75 cents a share. Revenue rose to
$172.5 million -- a record for the quarter -- from $158
million. The year-earlier per-share figure was adjusted to
reflect a 10% stock dividend in October 1989.

   The "principal difference is the depreciation on our new
building," said a spokesman. Such an increased write-off
tends to erode bottom-line results, he said. "In spite of all
this, our after-tax profit margins are just slightly under
9%, and compared to rest of industry, that still looks pretty
good," he added.
   In the six months, net income eased 6.6% to $29.7 million,
or $1.29 a share, from $31.8 million, or an adjusted $1.39 a
share. Revenue rose 11% to $338.9 million from $306.5
million.
