   RIVERDALE, Ill. -- Acme Steel Co., in an effort to expand
its steel processing business, said it bought certain assets
from Donovan Steel Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, for undisclosed
terms.
   The steel maker said it bought slitters and other
equipment from Donovan and will lease the former Donovan
facility, which will do business as Alta Slitting Corp., a
newly formed Acme subsidiary.
