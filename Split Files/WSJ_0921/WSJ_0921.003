   A majority of Americans, the polls say, favor military
action against Iraq -- even if their fellow Americans are
still trapped there. But Patty Hale is "definitely not with
the majority."
   Her husband, Edward, was working on an oil rig on Kuwait's
northern border at dawn on the day of the invasion. He was
among the first American citizens captured and whisked away
to Iraq. "I can't imagine that anybody who has a family
member there would be interested in dropping bombs," she
says, "unless they were interested in instant divorce. And
that's certainly not in my mind." Mr. and Mrs. Hale have been
married 22 years.

   The relatives of the U.S. citizens in Kuwait and Iraq
observe with muted horror as public support for combat
appears to mount. On Aug. 8, 49% of Americans favored
military action even if hostages were harmed, a USA
Today/Gannett News Service poll found. By Aug. 22, the same
poll found that figure had risen to 54%. And in a Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll taken this week, 53% of Americans surveyed
said they would support military action in spite of the
hostages.
   Michael Saba, founder of Coming Home, a group representing
hostage relatives, said that for all of the family members,
"their concern was with this attitude of
let's-go-over-there-and-kick-their-butts. It's extremely
frightening to them."
   But Mr. Saba said that many relatives of hostages he has
talked to feel compelled to publicly support Mr. Bush's
hawkish stance. "They don't want to sound unpatriotic," he
says.
   Donnita Cole is "a military mom and a hostage wife." Her
son is a U.S. soldier stationed in the Saudi desert, her
husband "a human shield" somewhere in Iraq. She mailed her
son and his unit a big box of provisions this week --
including more than 300 paperback books to occupy the hours
under the desert sun. But she has no mailing address for her
husband.
   "I'd like for these people {calling for military action}
to talk to me," Mrs. Cole says. "I would like for them to
tell me, face to face, that my Johnny is expendable. . . .
These are still live human beings we're talking about."
   John Cole had begun work as a drilling supervisor four
months before the invasion, and Mrs. Cole was about to join
him. She had rented their Texas home, packed all their
belongings and even booked her tickets when she got word that
Iraqi troops were marching into Kuwait. Her daughter called
with the news a half hour after midnight, Aug. 2. "From 12:30
on, all night long, I tried to call him. Every 20 minutes for
the next four days, I tried to call him." She never got
through.
   The day of the invasion, Ingrid Pawlowski was in Kuwait
City with her husband, Paul, an architect for an engineering
firm, and her seven-year-old daughter, Tess. Gunshots woke
them at 6:30 a.m. They spent the next several weeks treading
softly behind their drawn curtains, conserving a rapidly
dwindling food supply and "fearing a knock on the door," Mrs.
Pawlowski says. "I'd measure the success of the day by how
afraid I felt." She and her daughter finally got out, but Mr.
Pawlowski had to stay behind. She has not heard from him.
   "War is all very nice when you are sipping martinis in
your New York apartment, speculating on the pros and cons of
armed conflict," she says. "I think there's very little
understanding of what the realities are over there."
   Mrs. Pawlowski says the press bears some responsibility
for the warlike mentality: "There seems to be less focus in
the media on the hostages" than in past Middle East hostage
crises -- and more interest in combat.
   Betty Seago's husband, Guy, an electronics teacher, was
hauled in by Iraqi troops while trying to flee in a
four-wheel-drive through the desert. "I try not to listen to
the polls," Mrs. Seago says softly. "It looks like we're
heading toward war, but I try not to dwell on it. I go to
church a lot."
   The bellicose posture of Americans in the polls marks a
shift from American public attitudes toward past
hostage-taking episodes in the Middle East -- from the
drawn-out Iranian crisis of 1979-1981 to the imprisonment of
Americans in Beirut following the 1985 TWA hijacking over
Greece.
   Ironically, while these two past events involved far fewer
people, Americans were far more leery then of taking military
steps that might jeopardize hostages. An ABC/Washington Post
poll in June 1985, for example, found that six in 10
Americans favored giving in to the hijackers' terms if the
alternative meant further injury to U.S. hostages. A 1985 CBS
poll reported similar results.
   During the Iranian affair, when President Carter openly
and repeatedly declared that saving hostage lives was his
first priority, a majority of Americans agreed with him; most
1980 opinion polls showed that most Americans opposed
military action for fear it would endanger the hostages.
   But today, not only do more Americans seem less anxious
about the fate of their trapped countrymen, some even want to
fault the hostages themselves for their plight.
   "On almost every talk show I've been on," Mr. Saba says,
"someone calls in and says, `Well, it's their fault for being
in that part of the world in the first place.' There's a lot
of this blaming-the-victim business going around. Why have
people gotten so hardened?"
   The much larger number of hostages involved may be one
reason. "It's such a big situation and there are so many
people involved, it's hard to personalize it," Mr. Saba says.
   Mrs. Hale, however, her voice breaking as she speaks, has
no trouble personalizing the situation. For those having
difficulties, she recommends the following technique: "Maybe
they should take a look at their husband or their wife across
the dinner table and think how would it feel if they were the
ones there."
