   WASHINGTON -- The Education Department has selected the
United Student Aid Funds to take over the $9 billion
student-loan portfolio of a financially troubled guarantee
agency.
   Officials said that United Student Aid Funds's plan for
resolving the problems facing the Higher Education Assistance
Foundation would be cheaper than a competing offer from the
Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae.
Officials wouldn't provide details of the competing offers.

   By taking over HEAF's operations and portfolio, United
Student Aid Funds will become the largest of the nation's 54
loan-guarantee agencies, assuming a position of dominance
that makes some smaller agencies nervous. United Student Aid
Funds, which is based in Indianapolis, currently has a
portfolio of about $12 billion.
   The department's recommendation must be cleared by the
Office of Management and Budget. But administration officials
predict that OMB will support the decision unless Sallie Mae,
the publicly held corporation that the government chartered
to create a secondary market for student loans, makes an
unexpected new proposal. A Sallie Mae official declined to
comment.
   Officials said one obstacle to Sallie Mae's proposal was
the company's insistence that the government pay it a fee for
managing the HEAF portfolio.
   In addition to resolving the problems at HEAF, which got
into trouble because it guaranteed too many loans that went
into default, the administration is advocating a plan to slow
the surging student-loan default rate. Defaults on student
loans will cost the government an estimated $2.3 billion in
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   In the current budget negotiations, the administration has
proposed saving $3.3 billion over five years by giving the
Education Department expedited authority to drop from the
loan program any schools that consistently have default rates
of more than 25%. Proprietary schools, which train students
in such trades as truck driving and hairdressing, tend to
have the highest default rates. It's unclear, however,
whether the Democrats will accept the proposal as part of the
five-year deficit-reduction package that the administration
and Congress are struggling to work out.
   HEAF, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., got into
financial difficulty because it guaranteed a high volume of
loans to proprietary-school students. At one point, the
default rate on these loans was 60%.
   Under the federal loan program, students at certified
schools borrow from banks, and one of the nation's nonprofit
guarantee agencies, of which HEAF and United Student Aid
Funds are the largest, insures the loan. The government then
reinsures the loan.
   Generally, the Education Department pays the guarantee
agency 100% of the balance on defaulted loans. But that rate
can drop as low as 80% if the guarantee agency's payments on
defaulted loans exceed 9% of the agency's insured loans. HEAF
is losing money because it's receiving a government
reimbursement of 80% on defaulted loans on which it's paying
banks and other lenders 100%.
   United Student Aid Funds's plan to take over the HEAF
portfolio will cost the government about $90 million over six
years because the department will have to pay 100% on
defaulted loans, rather than the 80% it would have paid HEAF.
The $90 million will protect United Student Aid Funds against
loss on loans that HEAF guaranteed.
