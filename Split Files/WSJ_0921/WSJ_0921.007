   In the society-page equivalent of tearing down the Berlin
Wall, the New York Times is opening up its weddings section
to the masses.
   For years, the wedding and engagement announcements in the
Sunday Times -- dubbed the "merger and acquisitions page" by
close readers -- tended to focus heavily on the scions of
such dynasties as the du Ponts and the Rockefellers.
Impressive pedigrees and Ivy League degrees appeared to
ensure prominent mention on the pages, but how to get
mentioned at all was a riddle for more common folk.

   But now, as part of an effort to adopt a more egalitarian
look for the 1990s, the Times is featuring more minorities,
public school graduates, and just plain working stiffs in its
wedding reportage. To satisfy readers' curiosity, the
newspaper is increasingly running photos of couples instead
of just brides, and mentioning the couples' ages as well.
   And from now on, to answer the really burning question,
particularly among those still single, the Times is going to
start selectively recounting how couples met.
   "How they met will only be included if the answer has some
very strong journalistic content that makes the announcement
a better story," says Bill Adler, a spokesman for the Times.
The couple who met toiling together in the Peace Corps in
Botswana, for example, are more likely to have their story
immortalized than, say, the pair who hooked up at a singles
bar.
   Not every innovation sticks, of course. In August, the
Times tried printing names of brides and grooms in boldface
type, like in a gossip column. Editors said it cluttered the
page and dropped the idea.
   While Times officials say there has never been a policy
favoring the prominent, they acknowledge that the perception
among readers may have been that only the upper crust was
welcome. Editors point out that in recent months, there have
been more blacks and Asians on the page, as well as
interracial couples.
   The paper is reaching out to minorities by putting the
word out to various professional and social organizations
that there is a new openness. And it has started a recorded
telephone message that walks young marrieds-to-be through the
intricacies of filling out a Times wedding-announcement form.
   "The yardstick for the page has always been achievement,
not social prominence," says Mr. Adler. "Now we want it to
reflect society at large."
