   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The main entrance of Chemical Bank's
office here is locked. Seen through a window, the
wood-paneled reception area looks empty and forlorn. A
hand-written sign directs visitors to a back entrance down
the hallway.
   After 16 years and hundreds of millions of dollars of
business in Taiwan, the unit of Chemical Banking Corp., New
York, is closing its branch office this month and leaving
town.

   The ax also is poised to fall down the street at Chase
Manhattan Bank, a division of Chase Manhattan Corp., New
York. Chase has put its credit-card business up for sale, and
if the price is right, the bank intends to close its
consumer-banking operation altogether.
   At a time when the Taiwan government is opening its
consumer-banking industry wider to foreign banks, many U.S.
banks are more concerned with retrenchment than expansion.
They are reassessing their place in Taiwan because of tough
bottomline pressures world-wide, and because of the
increasingly limited returns they can earn in a highly
competitive market.
   While Chemical and Chase are the only foreign banks to
announce cutbacks so far, Taiwan's foreign banking community
is buzzing with rumors of other branches on the block, jobs
in jeopardy and credit lines under review. Bankers expect
further belt-tightening in the coming months, especially if
Taiwan's economy sinks into a prolonged period of slowing
growth.
   "Most of the banks in town realize we're entering a
difficult period," says a Chase Manhattan official.
"Traditional commercial banking in Taiwan has become less
attractive."
   "Is this going to catch up with other banks, or are they
going to be able to tough it out?" asks Steven R. Champion,
president of International Investment Trust Co., a
fund-management company. "There are signs they may all be
coming under pressure."
   Bankers note that one ramification of moves to pull back
could be a slowing of the pace of innovation in the market.
Foreign banks have been a force for change in Taiwan banking,
particularly in pushing the central bank to allow new
services.
   On the surface, Taiwan would appear to be a prime market
for foreign banks. It boasts more than $100 billion a year in
trade, more than $60 billion in foreign reserves -- with a
rising amount of that flowing out of the country every year
-- and an increasingly wealthy populace that has been offered
only limited consumer-banking services by local institutions.
   The Finance Ministry says that 37 foreign banks have
Taiwan branches, while an additional 18 operate
representative offices. Still, their share of the market is
small, commanding only 1% of New Taiwan dollar deposits and
less than 5% of the domestic loan market.
   Most foreign banks concentrate on corporate banking,
including short-term lending, trade-related services,
foreign-exchange trading and merchant banking. A smaller
group, led by the Citibank subsidiary of Citicorp of New
York, is pushing into consumer banking, taking deposits and
making loans.
   Several foreign banks are now preparing to increase their
consumer-banking presence to take advantage of a government
commitment to allow banks to expand the number of branches
each may operate on the island to three from two.
   But for other banks, this is not the time for expanding in
Taiwan -- or other Asian markets. Many banks are particularly
hard-pressed by the Bank for International Settlements'
requirement that by 1992 they have an 8% capital-to-asset
ratio. At a time when capital is difficult to raise, banks
are being forced to reduce existing loan portfolios and cut
new lending in some markets. Some American banks also are
severely squeezed by the double-whammy of a flat U.S. economy
and a banking system badly shaken by the savings-and-loan
crisis.
   "The enthusiasm to open branches in Asia and around the
world is diminishing," says a European banker based in Asia.
   Like Taiwan, other countries in Asia offer what would
appear to be great opportunities for foreign banks because of
their rapidly growing economies, but there is little or no
access to consumer banking, and outside of Citibank and the
American Express Bank unit of American Express Co. of New
York, few have been willing to spend the money to establish
the branch networks necessary to tap that business.
   "American banks' retreating or retrenching or disappearing
has very little to do with Taiwan, but has everything to do
with American banks," says a senior U.S. banker. "What we see
here is the result of some of the actions that all of the
moneycenter banks have been forced to take."
   It is this pressure that is forcing Chemical Bank to close
its Taipei branch, bankers say. Formerly a major presence in
Asian commercial banking, Chemical has been cutting back in
the region since the mid-1980s.
   Ultimately, bankers say, Chemical is shutting down because
its headquarters in New York decided to shift its focus
toward banking in the Northeast and Texas. Internationally,
the bank is consolidating in such major money centers as
Tokyo, Hong Kong, London and Frankfurt.
   Chemical intends to use its Hong Kong office to continue
providing fee-based services to clients from Taiwan, but
bankers say that may prove difficult without a permanent
local operation. Leaving Taiwan means "you lose the human
capital," an American banker says. "With that you lose your
knowledge of the market."
   Chase denies that its move to drop out of consumer banking
after two years in the business has anything to do with
shifting global priorities. Rather, bankers say Chase's
decision was based on problems with Taiwan's system for
handling credit-card accounts billed in New Taiwan dollars.
The accounts for such cards must be processed by a single
institution, a requirement that bankers say is too
restrictive.
   "Chase is very much staying in the market as a major
player," the Chase official says. "This is sort of a modest
streamlining."
   In coming months, the question of costs is likely to grow
increasingly important in banks' assessments of their future
in Taiwan. Taipei is an expensive city in which to set up
shop. Rents in the financial district are high, and wages for
local personnel are rising.
   Moreover, bankers say they are facing stiffer competition
and slimmer margins. Taiwanese companies have reduced their
U.S. dollar borrowing because the American currency has been
strengthening against the local unit in the past year.
   Lending to Taiwanese companies in the local currency isn't
particularly profitable either these days, a U.S. banker
says, because that means "competing with local banks for New
Taiwan dollar business, and that's difficult to do."
   "For the kind of business that's done here, this is
probably an overbanked market," says Edward J. Moriarty,
chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce's banking
committee and general manager of Bank of New York's Taiwan
branch.
   Now, bankers are facing an added concern: The combination
of slow exports, the Taipei stock market's recent sharp
decline and a slumping property market are undermining the
economy. The Directorate General for Budget Accounting and
Statistics last month reduced its projection for 1990
economic growth to 5.2% from 7.2%, the lowest level since
1982.
   Borrowing is down, bankers say, and delinquent loans are
on the rise. Baring Securities (Taiwan) Ltd. reports that 1%
of all loans outstanding in Taiwan are overdue, or about NT$3
billion (US$109.9 million) in loans.
   The worst may be yet to come. Many bankers expect the full
ramifications of the slump to hit home only later this year,
and few doubt there will be some large loan defaults.
   Any significant losses could prove the catalyst in pushing
some headquarters to quit Taiwan. "You might go five straight
years of making $5 million" a year, says Mr. Champion of
International Investment Trust. "But if in the sixth year you
lose $50 million," the home office may decide the market
isn't worth it.
