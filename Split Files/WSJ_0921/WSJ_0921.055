   The previous record was 108.5 million kiloliters in 1988,
Kirin officials said.
   In 1989, Japan surpassed Britain to become the world's
fourth-largest beer brewer, Kirin said.
   The largest producer by far was the U.S., with an
estimated production of 23.4 million kiloliters, up 0.6% from
1988. U.S. brewers accounted for 21.1% of total global
production, the officials said.
   They said West Germany was second with 9.3 million
kiloliters, up 0.4%, followed by China with 6.2 million
kiloliters, down 3%.
   Japan was next at 6.1 million kiloliters, up 5.1%,
followed by Britain with six million kiloliters, down 0.4%.
   The figures are based on data obtained from beer
associations around the world, Kirin said.
