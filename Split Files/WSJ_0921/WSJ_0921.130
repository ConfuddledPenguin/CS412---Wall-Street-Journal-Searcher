   WASHINGTON -- As long as Saddam Hussein holds Americans
hostage in the Middle East they're safe from the IRS.
   The Internal Revenue Service said it will suspend audits
of any Americans detained in Iraq and Kuwait as well as any
efforts to collect unpaid taxes.

   To obtain such relief, the agency asks families of
hostages to call 1-800-829-4351 during business hours and
give the names and Social Security numbers of those detained
-- and impart any information "concerning ongoing actions
with the IRS."
   The agency also indicated it will consider postponing
examinations or tax bills of U.S. troops or military
reservists assigned to Operation Desert Shield in the Persian
Gulf. They should call the regular federal tax-assistance
number, 1-800-424-1040, "in response to correspondence
received regarding an examination or past due taxes so that
alternatives may be considered, such as postponing an
examination or a payment," the IRS said.
