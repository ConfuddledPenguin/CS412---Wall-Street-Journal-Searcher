   DALLAS -- Adding to an already long list of companies it
is suing for patent infringement, computer-chip giant Texas
Instruments Inc. filed suit last Thursday against mail-order
computer firm Dell Computer Corp.
   TI asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas to assess a dollar amount for damages, claiming that
Dell, of Austin, Texas, violated several key patents in
building its personal computers. "People who make PC clones
generally violate our patents," a TI spokesman said.

   TI and Dell had been discussing patent issues since April.
"We were very surprised when they filed," said a Dell
spokesman.
   Dell says the suit is without merit -- merely another
example of TI's overactive legal department. Within the past
year, TI has sued its own customers and competing U.S. chip
firms on patent-related matters. Among those companies are
Zenith Data Systems Corp., Analog Devices Inc. and LSI Logic
Corp.
   Dell is the second Texas computer maker this month to spar
in court over patents with TI. Tandy Corp. on Sept. 6 alleged
that TI broke federal antitrust laws by falsely claiming
ownership of certain microprocessor technologies. Tandy also
alleged that TI demanded unreasonably high royalty payments.
   Japanese chip firms have also accused TI of demanding
exorbitant royalty rates. A Japanese press report said TI
demanded 10% of the wholesale value of products using chips
based on a TI patent. TI would not confirm the report.
