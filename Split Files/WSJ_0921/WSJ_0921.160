   WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- When Volkswagen AG decided to
build cars and engines in East Germany, it was a bittersweet
homecoming for company Chairman Carl H. Hahn.
   Six decades ago, he was a boy growing up just minutes from
the engine plant in Chemnitz, East Germany, that Volkswagen
now is running in a joint venture with an East German
company. His father was instrumental in turning the cars then
produced at the nearby Zwickau plant into a successful brand
that later became part of Audi.

   Upon returning recently, however, Mr. Hahn found crumbling
homes and antiquated factories with leaking roofs. Conditions
were "below human dignity," he says. Rebuilding his old home
town and its main industry now, after the fall of the Berlin
Wall, "is very emotional," he says.
   This kind of personal involvement has characterized Mr.
Hahn's leadership since he took over Volkswagen eight years
ago. Although the company is a fringe player in the U.S. with
less than 2% of the car market, in Europe Volkswagen is the
No. 1 car maker in the world's largest car market.
   Now, Mr. Hahn, 64 years old, is leading the company on an
aggressive international expansion drive with a newly united
Germany as the base. But as it rolls the dice on ventures in
Eastern Europe, Mexico and China, Volkswagen is struggling
with a big question: What to do about Mr. Hahn, who is
scheduled to retire next year?
   Speculation is rampant in European business circles over
which of five candidates will succeed Mr. Hahn. And the race
is attracting considerable attention in Germany.
   Last month, the German publication Industriemagazin boldly
declared that Daniel Goeudevert, the 48-year-old former head
of Ford Motor Co.'s German operations and now VW's purchasing
chief, was destined to "ascend to Caesar's throne."
   But there is also the possibility that the company's
supervisory board will do the unprecedented, and ask Mr. Hahn
to remain as chairman after he turns 65 and his current
contract runs out. That scenario, which would require the
board to give Mr. Hahn a special exemption under VW's bylaws,
is gaining credibility with many company insiders.
   Mr. Hahn, so far, insists he doesn't intend to stay on
past his retirement. "I am very optimistic the world doesn't
depend on me, and I am confident Volkswagen will be as
successful, if not more successful, when I am gone," Mr. Hahn
said earlier this week in a meeting with reporters and
auto-industry analysts. However, he doesn't rule out
extending his tenure if the supervisory board asks him to
stay.
   Should Mr. Hahn leave, there's a crowd waiting in the
wings to succeed him. There's Mr. Goeudevert, a Frenchman who
could become the first foreign-born head of VW. Then there's
Martin Posth, 46, VW's personnel head; Dieter Ullsperger, 44,
VW's top financial officer; and Ferdinand Piech, 53, head of
VW's Audi division. An outside candidate is Helmut Werner,
53, a top executive at Daimler-Benz AG.
   But those who think Mr. Hahn may stay point to the
relative youth of these executives, and the fact that none of
them has the kind of political clout or international
experience that Mr. Hahn has. Earlier this month, for
example, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President
Francois Mitterrand and top Soviet and East European
officials gathered at Mr. Hahn's invitation in Wolfsburg to
discuss Eastern Europe.
   Moreover, Volkswagen is heading into uncertain times.
Although the company is strong in Europe, that base is far
from secure. The same Japanese auto makers that battered the
company in the U.S. over the past decade are gearing up for
an assault on the European market.
   Volkswagen fought the Japanese in the U.S. and lost. Once
bigger in the U.S. than all other import brands combined,
VW's U.S. market share has dwindled to just 1.4%. Now,
analysts say VW could face the same threat in Europe, and at
least one recently advised clients to sell VW stock.
   One of Volkswagen's big problems is the high cost of West
German labor. That's why Mr. Hahn is looking elsewhere to
expand VW's operations. In Spain, where labor costs are
substantially less, VW saved the foundering SEAT S.A.
operations and now plans to boost output of SEAT cars to more
than 700,000 from 500,000 annually.
   In China, VW is shrugging off the risk of political
instability and plans to increase output from its Shanghai
plant to about 150,000 cars a year from the current 16,000.
Meanwhile, Mr. Hahn is trying to persuade more of VW's
suppliers to locate operations in Mexico to cut costs in
Volkswagen's Mexican assembly operations.
   But with so much at risk, many analysts think Mr. Hahn
ultimately will decide he should stay on. "Emotion will
override everything else," says Lehman Brothers analyst
Joseph Phillippi. "I can't imagine he'll leave before making
sure everything gets off okay."
