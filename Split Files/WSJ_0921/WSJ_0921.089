   NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. -- At first glance, Arco Chemical Co.
seems far removed from the hurly-burly of geopolitical
change. Its headquarters is a 300-acre campus in the horse
country west of Philadelphia.
   Yet the lush, country-club atmosphere is deceiving, for
any significant event anywhere in the world reverberates
through company corridors.

   A massacre in Beijing? Arco's shipments into China are
stopped. Communism falls in Eastern Europe? Arco faces tough
decisions about joint ventures, as well as the threat of
stronger competitors from Germany.
   Moreover, events don't have to be earthshaking to send
tremors through headquarters. You name the world economic
trend and somehow it affects Arco -- from stronger Japanese
competition, to rising or falling interest rates, to Korean
government policy on financing joint ventures, to concern
over the environment.
   Although Arco risks being buffeted by world political and
economic events, the coin has a flip side. The company has
shed its less successful product lines, and around the world
it can now take advantage of its technological edge within
its narrow niche. That's what defines Arco's strategy. And
it's a strategy being followed by many companies that were
broad-based in the 1960s and 1970s and then fell on hard
times.
   It's also a strategy that has paid off: Arco Chemical
rakes in more than one-third of its $2.7 billion in sales
from abroad, and makes about half of its new investment
outside of the U.S.
   For a long time, Arco Chemical was the victim of trying to
be all things to all people. It had overexpanded two decades
ago and when sales failed to grow, it suffered heavy losses.
"Overcapacity was the story of this company in the 1970s,"
says Harold Sorgenti, president and chief executive.
   In the 1980s, the company stripped itself down to its most
competitive lines of business. That meant mostly intermediate
chemicals used in making such things as cushions and bedding.
It also included chemicals used in automotive resins and fuel
additives. At one point, revenue shrank from $3.5 billion
annually to $1.5 billion. But now it claims half the global
market for the products it makes. In 1987, Atlantic Richfield
Co. sold part of Arco Chemical in a public offering, but the
giant energy company still owns more than 80% of the chemical
maker's stock. Lodwrick M. Cook, Atlantic Richfield's
chairman and chief executive, is also Arco Chemical's
chairman.
   Arco Chemical went global partly because it was forced to.
The company's engineering resins, under the Dylark trademark,
are sold to the auto industry. In the past, that meant
selling exclusively to Detroit's Big Three in the U.S.
market. No longer.
   "Today we deal with Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Renault,
Peugeot and Volkswagen," says Jack E. Oppasser, vice
president for world-wide business management. "We're dealing
with Nissan and Toyota in Japan and in the U.S. We're dealing
with Ford and General Motors in the U.S. and in Europe." Arco
has to be able to deliver a product anywhere in the world,
Mr. Oppasser says, or else lose the business.
   Global operations have also meant, however, that Arco
faces increasingly stiff competition from abroad, in addition
to its traditional U.S. competitors such as Dow Chemical.
   European companies have been expanding operations in
America. Among them are German concerns such as Bayer and
BASF, French companies such as Rhone Poulenc, and British
giant ICI, which has made numerous U.S. acquisitions in
recent years.
   Japanese competitors are also beginning to attack Arco's
business lines -- in propylene glycol and polyols,
intermediate chemicals used to make foam for seat cushions
and many other products. For example, Asahi Glass has begun a
fierce price-cutting campaign in both Asia and Europe on
products in which Arco is strong. In return, Arco has
counterattacked by trying to steal one of Asahi's biggest
customers in Japan.
   Arco executives say the battle against Asahi Glass is
greatly aided by having a joint-venture partner, in this case
Sumitomo Chemical. Sumitomo has been a source of competitive
intelligence, and its knowledge of the Japanese market has
been instrumental in launching the counterattack.
   "The Japanese can sometimes be difficult and sometimes
very, very cooperative," says Mr. Oppasser. "Our partner in
Japan, Sumitomo Chemical, has been a very good partner."
   Joint ventures are an inescapable -- if not always welcome
-- part of the global business landscape these days. Most
large companies would prefer to go it alone overseas, but
that isn't practical for many of them. Alliances or joint
ventures offer the fastest, cheapest and least risky way to
go world-wide quickly.
   Arco's joint ventures have provided the company entree
into difficult overseas markets, especially in Asia. The
price has been a certain lack of control over the plant's
production, among other things.
   But for Arco a more formidable challenge comes from
political events. They are often unforeseen, yet they can
quickly change the business landscape for an entire region,
making this month's sales targets obsolete. More ominously,
they can make this year's capital-spending plans uneconomical
overnight.
   Consider the huge question mark posed by China. Last
year's political upheaval and crackdown, climaxed by the
Beijing government's massacre of demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square, had immediate repercussions for the company.
   The crisis in China interrupted shipments of styrene, one
of the company's major products. Styrene is used in a variety
of consumer products, including insulated cups, food
containers and building insulation. The inability of Western
companies to get supplies into China caused a glut in the
market and a world-wide drop in prices. Partly as a result,
Arco's 1989 earnings fell from year-earlier levels, to $405
million from $494 million. Revenue declined slightly, to
$2.66 billion from $2.7 billion.
   The styrene market has since rebounded, but China's future
as a market for Arco products is still a puzzle. Political
stability is only one concern. At least as important is
China's primitive transportation network, which makes it
difficult for Arco to distribute its products.
   "It's the world's largest market. The standard of living
is increasing. You have to be interested" in China, says Mr.
Sorgenti, the Arco president. "The question is the timing of
our investments and size of investments."
   In Eastern Europe, the challenge facing Arco is to seize
an opportunity, although one that may develop only slowly. "I
don't think things are going to happen quite as fast as
people believe," says Mr. Sorgenti. "Nonetheless, we feel
strongly that we ought to be positioning ourselves for what
is going to be a market equal in size to the U.S. We have
over 350 million people who have been thrust on the market.
I'm including Eastern Europe and Russia."
   Says Marvin Schlanger, chief financial officer: "In
Western Europe, we're comfortable talking about a single
market. In Eastern Europe, each country is a unique
situation." In an effort to develop business, Arco has begun
talking with several possible partners about joint ventures,
most notably in Hungary but also in Czechoslovakia. For the
time being, Arco is using its Western European outpost as a
springboard for exports into Eastern Europe. Arco hopes that
today's trickle of sales will increase substantially by the
end of 1990.
   The biggest decision concerns the location of Arco's next
plant. It is scheduled to be a propylene oxide facility that
would cost perhaps $500 million and would produce
commodity-type chemicals that could be sold in large
quantities, prior to being refined into end products. "The
choice is between Europe and Southeast Asia. It's a tossup,"
says Mr. Oppasser, the Arco vice president. "We'll make that
decision within a year." The uncertain growth potential of
Eastern Europe is the biggest wild card here.
   Many U.S. companies in a number of industries are facing
the same types of tough investment decisions these days.
Among the factors are these: the potential growth in each
market, the political stability of the country, the
availability and cost of energy, the cost of raw materials,
the cost of construction, the supply of technical personnel,
and the tax benefits offered by the host country.
   Faddishness may also play a part, and it is something
executives try to factor out of their thinking. "The current
`in' mode of thinking is Eastern Europe over Southeast Asia,"
says Mr. Oppasser. "One or two years ago it was Southeast
Asia. Southeast Asia is still growing and very desirable."
   Before any decision is made, Arco executives in the
respective regions -- Arco Chemical Europe and Arco Chemical
Asia-Pacific -- will each submit reports arguing why their
region should get the next plant. This will be supplemented
by analysis at headquarters, including reports by outside
consultants.
   The tensions and the competition between regions are
considered natural. Mr. Oppasser heads a group of 11 people,
formed two years ago, to augment the regional viewpoints with
a global view from headquarters.
   The company, for instance, had planned to ship propylene
glycol for the Asia Pacific region out of a plant in
Rotterdam but last year decided it would be cheaper to
produce the chemicals in the U.S. instead.
   "It affected profitability of the European operation by a
little over $1 million, but the overall impact on Arco
Chemical was a positive $3.3 million," Mr. Oppasser says.
"Europe wasn't necessarily happy. But it was the right
decision."
   Arco executives also see the opportunity to make money
from the growing concern over the environment, especially in
the U.S.
   The company is a leading producer of a high-octane
gasoline additive whose growth is being driven by increasing
demand for unleaded fuels. As the Clean Air Act is put into
effect, Arco expects surging demand for the product, called
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE.
   Arco plans to divert some of its European production of
MTBE to the East Coast. That will ease pressure on a large
plant in Houston, which will focus on producing largely for
the Western part of the U.S. market. Eventually, Arco
Chemical executives say, demand should increase in Europe,
too. But as in the past, the U.S. tends to lead Europe (and
Asia) by several years in adopting stricter environmental
controls.
   The larger question, though, is whether a medium-sized
niche player such as Arco Chemical can compete in a field
dominated by giants. It is a question that will be faced by
many companies all over the globe, as restructuring of
industry takes place in the next few years.
   "Can the medium-sized {company} survive? If you don't have
something special to contribute, the answer is no," says Mr.
Sorgenti, Arco's president. "We have 50% of the world market
in the products where we compete. That says we're going to be
competitive."
   But Mr. Sorgenti quickly adds, "It doesn't say we won't
have competition. The danger is, when you're competing
narrowly against a giant, if he wants to, he can trample us."
