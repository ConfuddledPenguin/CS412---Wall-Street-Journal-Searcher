   A federal court jury in Seattle began deliberations this
week to determine who should pay $97.5 million to clean up
two hazardous waste sites in the Puget Sound area: Boeing Co.
or its insurers.
   During the four weeks of testimony, Boeing tried to elicit
that its insurance carriers are responsible for covering the
costs because it never expected pollution problems. The
insurers sought to prove that the airplane maker had long
been alerted to the potential fallout from years of dumping
but chose to ignore those warnings.

   The case is being closely watched by manufacturers in
other industries, which face similar Superfund disputes.
Experts say that only one other Superfund case of this scope
has actually gone to trial. In December 1988, Shell Oil Co.
lost to its insurers over the $1 billion cleanup of a
toxic-waste site near Denver.
   The Boeing case involves two dumps in King County, Wash.,
where from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s the company
shipped some 24 million gallons of waste, including solvents,
heavy metals and some acids. Boeing later agreed in
court-ordered settlements with regulators to clean up the
properties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, commonly known as
Superfund.
   In the trial, Boeing called witnesses who maintained that
the company pressed the owners of the waste sites to comply
with environmental regulations. The company also argued that
the state permitted it to dump when and where it did, and
that the methods of disposal it used were better than any
available alternatives.
   T.A. Wilson, who retired as Boeing chief executive officer
in 1986, testified that he never realized the company was
polluting. "I don't think we thought we were," he said.
   But the insurers, which include Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.,
Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., American International
Group and underwriters for Lloyd's of London, countered with
their own witnesses. They brought to the stand a former
Boeing chemical engineer who said that the company had been
warned about the possibility of contamination at the sites,
but turned a blind eye to plans that called for more
sophisticated -- and more expensive -- waste-treatment
systems. Lawyers for the insurance companies drew the same
point from some of Boeing's own witnesses during
cross-examination.
   For the world's biggest commercial jet builder, the stakes
are high. Boeing has sued a number of other companies that
over the years also used one of the waste sites, Western
Processing, in an attempt to have them contribute more to the
cleanup. But these companies, including Unocal Corp.,
Lockheed Corp., Precision Castparts Corp. and Contintental
Can Co., have balked; they say they've paid enough already,
and Boeing still hasn't owned up to its fair share of the
trouble.
   "Even though we're on the industry side, we're interested
this time in what the insurance companies are able to show,"
said Larry Hard, who is representing Unocal. He said his
client and some of the other companies are preparing to go to
trial in about a year.
   Besides the $97.5 million of expenses being mulled now,
Boeing potentially faces cleanup costs at 13 other locations
around the country.
   Whether this case would serve as precedent, though, isn't
clear. Four state supreme courts and three federal appeals
courts have split over whether insurers can even be brought
to trial in Superfund cases. In January, the Washington State
Supreme Court ruled in a landmark 9-2 decision that Boeing's
claims for cleanup costs may be covered by the comprehensive
general liability policies at issue, paving the way for the
Boeing trial.
   The Seattle jury is expected to return a verdict any day
now, according to attorneys close to the situation. In
closing arguments on Tuesday, Boeing lawyer Robert Sayler
accused the insurers of engaging in "Boeing bashing" and said
pointedly: "They want to portray themselves as the Audubon
Society. They are not."
   "We think we presented a good case on the facts,"
countered George Bassett, a lawyer for AIG who presented
opening arguments for the insurers.
   "But insurance companies aren't always so well liked, and
Boeing is very well liked in this community," he
acknowledged. "We know it's going to be an uphill battle."
