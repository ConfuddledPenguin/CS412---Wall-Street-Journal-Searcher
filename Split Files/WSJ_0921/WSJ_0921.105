   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. put its oil and gas
properties in Spain back on the market after withdrawing them
last year for lack of any "appropriate bids."
   The properties include an 18.92% interest in the
Casablanca offshore oil field, 25% interests in a smaller
onshore oil field and in an onshore gas complex, and various
exploration permits.
</LP>

   The oil company said net proved reserves of its interests
in the three fields are estimated at the equivalent of about
six million barrels, of which about 80% is crude oil and the
rest is natural gas. Repsol, the Spanish government oil
company, operates the fields.
