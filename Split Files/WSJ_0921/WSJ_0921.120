   BOSTON --- Massachusetts, hoping to get a good reception
from nervous investors for an approaching bond issue, will
set up a special fund for tax receipts that will be
specifically pledged to pay off the bonds.
   Massachusetts' finances have investors worried in part
because of a tax rollback petition on the November ballot
that would reduce taxes by more than $1 billion in the
current fiscal year; the state's budget is around $13
billion. The anti-tax measure, if approved, would eliminate a
tax-increase package adopted recently by the legislature to
narrow a huge budget deficit.

   Establishing a dedicated trust fund is uncommon, although
it has been used in the past by other borrowers having
financial problems as a way to bolster investor interest.
   The state is setting up an "irrevocable trust fund" for
the new Series A bonds into which sufficient personal income
tax receipts will be paid monthly, according to Moody's
Investors Services Inc. Massachusetts is expected to issue
about $385 million of the Series A dedicated income tax bonds
next week.
   Moody's gave the new issue a rating of Baa-1, slightly
better than the worst-in-the-nation rating of Baa that it has
given Massachusetts' general obligation bonds. "We feel there
is some degree of enhancement provided" by the trust fund,
said George Leung, managing director for state ratings at
Moody's. Massachusetts also plans to issue another $225
million other bonds that are expected to be secured by a
letter of credit.
