   FALLING STOCK PRICES in Tokyo, combined with a strong
dollar, enabled the U.S. to regain ground from Japan in the
rankings of the world's largest companies and financial
institutions.
   Ranked by stock-market value, 42 of the world's 100
largest companies are Japanese this year, down from 50 a year
earlier. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone remains the top-ranked
company, while Industrial Bank of Japan falls to No. 5 from
No. 2.

   By comparison, 39 of the 100 largest companies this year
are U.S. concerns, compared with 35 the year before.
International Business Machines Corp. ranks No. 2, up from
No. 3 last year. And General Electric Co. jumps to No. 4 from
No. 13.
   Among banks, all of the top seven are Japanese. Credit
Agricole and Banque Nationale de Paris, both French, come in
at No. 8 and No. 9, while Citicorp rounds out the top 10.
Overall, 28 of the world's 100 largest banks are Japanese; 13
are American. France and West German each have 10 banks on
the list.
   These are some of the findings that emerge in The Wall
Street Journal's fifth annual global ranking of companies and
financial institutions. The world's 100 largest public
companies were monitored by Morgan Stanley Capital
International Perspective, based in New York and Geneva.
Rankings of the 100 largest banks, 50 largest insurers and 25
largest securities firms were compiled from the Worldscope
database, a product of Wright Investors Service, Bridgeport,
Conn.
   The lists generally don't include state-owned entities or
some closely held institutions for which data aren't
available.
