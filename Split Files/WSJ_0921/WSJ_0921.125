   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board drove a historic
crack in the wall separating investment banking and
commercial banking by authorizing J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. to
underwrite stocks. It is the first time a bank has had that
power since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act outlawed it because
of abuses during the Great Depression.
   The move comes at an unusual moment, with concern about
the health of the banking industry growing because of
widespread problems with real estate and other loans and with
the economy grinding along at a slow pace.

   But the Fed signaled in January 1989, when it gave banks
the power for the first time to underwrite corporate debt,
that it also intended to give banks the power to underwrite
equity securities. The central bank said in that decision it
wanted to wait and see how banks handled the debt powers, and
in letting J.P. Morgan lead the charge into stocks, the Fed
chose one of the strongest of the big banks.
   "It will be interesting to see what the political reaction
will be, with the problems of the banks gaining such
prominence," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial
institutions consultant. "But Morgan is so strong that the
Fed can't really be criticized from the standpoint that this
could affect the safety and soundness of the banking
industry."
   There was no immediate groundswell of opposition -- or
support -- on Capitol Hill after the Fed announced the
approval late yesterday. But many members were in their home
districts, observing the Jewish holiday or campaigning.
Still, it was ironic that only a few days ago the General
Accounting Office, an investigative and research arm of
Congress, recommended to the House Banking Committee that the
government insurance fund for banks be shored up and bank
capital increased before banks be given broad new powers.
   The Securities Industry Association, which has been
fighting a losing battle for years against bank inroads into
the securities business, raised the specter of the
savings-and-loan crisis in a statement calling the Fed ruling
"astonishing."
   "The banking and thrift industries are in a period of
turmoil not seen for decades," the group said in a statement
by its chairman, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. partner Robert Downey,
and the group's president, Edward O'Brien. A Fed spokesman
wouldn't comment when asked about the Fed's action amid the
concern about the banking system.
   However, the powers granted to J.P. Morgan to underwrite
securities through its J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. subsidiary
are hardly sweeping or an immediate threat to the venerable
Wall Street houses. The securities unit can't derive more
than 10% of its revenue from underwriting corporate equities,
together with corporate debt, commercial paper, securities
backed by mortgages and consumer debt, and municipal bonds
linked to revenue from specific projects. At least 90% of the
subsidiary's revenue must come from the much less-risky
underwriting of federal debt.
   Moreover, the timing of the Fed's decision isn't
particularly opportune for J.P. Morgan. Although the Dow
Jones Industrial Average remains at a relatively high level,
above the 2500 mark, the pace of equity underwriting hasn't
been robust, nor has it produced big profits for Wall Street
securities firms. Last year's pace of equity offerings was
the slowest since 1984, and it hasn't picked up appreciably
this year.
   Nevertheless, the Fed's action is a big triumph for the
portion of the banking industry -- mostly larger banks --
that has been frustrated in its attempts to wrest broader
powers from Congress. Congress has been reluctant to grant
new powers partly because it was caught in a traffic jam
between the wealthy banking and securities lobbies, and
partly because fears of the kind of abuses that led to the
creation of the Glass-Steagall barrier haven't abated.
   Those abuses included several instances of banks trying to
push their bad loans off on unwitting investors by packaging
them as securities. Those favoring giving banks securities
powers have argued that the far more extensive disclosure of
investment information required today will protect the
public. They also argue that the biggest American banks have
been safely underwriting stocks overseas, and that U.S. banks
need the powers to keep up in competition with increasingly
powerful foreign banks that underwrite stocks.
   Samuel Hayes, finance professor at Harvard Business
School, said "I think essentially the Glass-Steagall Act is
dead."
   Mr. Hayes called the SIA's objections a "smokescreen," and
noted that banks use separate securities subsidiaries without
access to insured deposits for their underwriting. Mr. Hayes
doubts other major banks "have the stomach for a full-fledged
foray into equity underwriting" because of lack of capital
and bad loans. But he believes the entry of J.P. Morgan and
other banks into the lucrative underwriting area eventually
will cut into Wall Street's profits. Equity underwriting
margins are 4% to 6%, he said, compared with only 0.5% for
debt.
   He predicted Morgan will threaten underwriters that sell
stocks to institutional investors, such as Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., First Boston, a unit of CS First Boston Group, and
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. more than those such as PaineWebber Inc.
that sell stocks mainly to individuals.
   John M. Hennessy, chief executive of CS First Boston Inc.,
offered "congratulations" to J.P. Morgan Chairman Dennis
Weatherstone. "It's a tough market," Mr. Hennessy said. "But
it always helps to have an extra dealer in the market with
money."
   At the same time, many of the largest U.S. banks have been
severely weakened by a succession of problems that have
crimped their ability to move aggressively into new markets,
or take new risks with their balance sheets.
   Stocks of many major commerical banks have declined 30% to
50% this year as a result of rising levels of problem loans
and falling values for assets backing up those loans --
particularly in real estate. J.P. Morgan is one of the few
big banks to have avoided the worst of these problems.
   Several banks have had permission to underwrite debt
securities for some time. Some of them rank among the top 20
but aren't yet crowding out investment bankers. So far this
year, J.P. Morgan ranks 11th among underwriters of all debt
securities, according to IDD Information Services. Among
other banks, Citicorp ranks 14th, Chemical Banking Corp.
17th, Bankers Trust New York Corp. 19th, and First Chicago
Corp. 20th.
   As well, several banks including Morgan, Bankers Trust,
and Citicorp, have attempted to establish a beachhead in the
market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds -- just as that
market has all but closed for new issues.
   Five other requests for stock-underwriting powers are
pending at the Fed, from Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Canadian Imperial.
   Separately, Fuji Bank Ltd. said it has applied for Fed
approval to undertake full brokerage services through its
U.S. brokerage unit, making it the first Japanese bank to do
so.
   The application was filed by Fuji Securities Inc., a
subsidiary based in Chicago, to expand the scope of its
securities business. Fuji Securities currently isn't allowed
to underwrite all types of equities, arrange privately placed
bonds or carry out other brokerage services.
