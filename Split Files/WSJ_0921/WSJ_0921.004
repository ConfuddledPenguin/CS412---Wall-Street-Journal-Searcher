   Californians will vote in November on what may be the most
significant piece of protectionist legislation in decades.
But few voters will think of it in those terms.
   The legislation is Proposition 128, the California
Environmental Protection Act of 1990. Called "Big Green" by
supporters and "the Hayden Initiative" by detractors, this
omnibus initiative runs 39 single-spaced, typed pages of
dense legalese, sprinkled with multisyllabic chemical names.
Its most radical provisions apply to pesticides and other
agricultural chemicals, and it is these sections that imperil
free trade.

   Before one can grasp the free-trade implications, however,
one must get a handle on the legislation's faulty "science."
Rejecting the toxicologists' fundamental principle that "the
dose makes the poison," Prop. 128 proceeds from the
unsupported assumption that a "toxic" is a "toxic,"
regardless of the dose.
   Prop. 128 would prohibit Californians from using any
pesticides demonstrated to cause cancer or reproductive harm
in tests on either humans or two different animal species,
regardless of dosage. The initiative would also require
manufacturers of "high hazard" pesticides -- those suspected
of being carcinogens -- to prove that these chemicals do not
cause cancer. Lacking such proof, these chemicals, too, would
be banned.
   The National Resources Defense Fund and other Prop. 128
supporters adamantly maintain that the ban would apply
initially to only 19 chemicals listed as known carcinogens or
reproductive toxins by the Environmental Protection Agency.
This narrow reading makes for good public relations, but it
doesn't stand up to scrutiny. In fact, Prop. 128 could ban
two-thirds of the agricultural chemicals used in California.
To understand why, you have to dig into the esoteric language
of the initiative -- a daunting assignment.
   Prop. 128 would ban even those pesticides whose inert
ingredients alone fail to pass muster. The proposition
defines "inert" to include contaminants of inert ingredients,
such as the chromium in clays used to deliver sulfur or the
benzene in oil sprays. Ironically, sulfur is a staple of
organic farming -- as well as a fungicide essential to
California's $1.4 billion grape industry. And oil-based
sprays are widely used in integrated pest-management
programs, which reduce the use of pesticides by fighting bad
bugs with good bugs.
   Even accepting the NRDC's narrow reading, however, Prop.
128 would ban such common agricultural chemicals as Captan, a
fungicide used on grapes, almonds and cotton -- California's
three leading export crops. While there is no ready
substitute for Captan, other chemicals are more replaceable
-- at a price. Trifluralin, used for weed control on 75% of
California's tomato crop, can be replaced with pebulate -- at
an additional cost of $7 an acre, estimates Leonard P.
Gianessi of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based
environmental research and education group. California
farmers are understandably opposed to Prop. 128.
   But the initiative doesn't merely prohibit use of these
chemicals by California growers. It also bans the sale of
food containing their residues -- including food produced
outside the state, whether foreign or domestic. This
provision would presumably protect California farmers from
less-regulated competition.
   Prop. 128's trade provisions could move California toward
the dream of the most radical wing of the green movement:
dividing the country into narrow bioregions, cut off from
trade. The result could be empty produce shelves in
California supermarkets.
   Washington state apple growers, for instance, ship some 10
million boxes, or 15% to 20% of their crop, to California
each year. Derl Derr, president of the International Apple
Institute, says many of those apples contain trace amounts of
chemicals whose residues would be prohibited by Prop. 128.
Marketing "adulterated" apples in California would open the
apple vendor to fines of $10,000 to $25,000 per violation per
day. So rather than selling their crops in California,
suggests Mr. Derr, many apple growers would turn to other
states.
   Indeed, more than a fifth of all fresh fruits and
vegetables brought into California in 1988 contained residues
that would be banned under Prop. 128, reports Sandra
Archibald of Stanford University's Food Research Institute.
This doesn't imply, however, that the residues were
dangerous. Of nearly 2,300 samples of fresh tomatoes from
Mexico tested over a five-year period, the Food and Drug
Administration found none that exceeded federal tolerances
for pesticides. Some 70%, however, would be prohibited under
Prop. 128. More than 99% of U.S. imports of fresh tomatoes
come from Mexico.
   By establishing a separate trade policy for the nation's
largest state -- and one that eschews mainstream science --
Prop. 128 runs directly counter to the Bush administration's
trade stance. In talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the U.S. is pushing hard to break down
agricultural trade barriers and harmonize food-safety
standards. In place of willy-nilly import regulations, U.S.
negotiators propose that an arbitrator decide whether an
importing country's standards are scientifically based, using
United Nations standards as a guide. U.N. standards are less
restrictive than existing U.S. rules and much less stringent
than those set by Prop 128.
   Even without any revisions, GATT might classify Prop. 128
as a nontariff trade barrier, making the U.S. subject to
retaliatory action. In response to Prop. 128, the U.S. trade
representative asked the International Trade Commission to
hold a hearing and prepare a report on the initiative's
potential impact on trade. An interim report will be released
by the end of this month, with the final report due by Dec.
31.
   Initiative supporters reacted ferociously. The NRDC issued
a press release calling the hearing part of "a larger
Administration strategy" that is "intent on preventing
California from enacting its own pesticide standards."
Although the NRDC claimed in its testimony that Prop. 128 is
legal under GATT, since it applies equally to all producers,
its press release seemed to concede the issue. It said the
ITC report could provide ammunition to "foreign importers,
who could use the report as a basis to challenge Big Green as
a violation of international trade regulations."
   In truth, however, Prop. 128 supporters couldn't have been
terribly surprised to run into conflict with GATT. "There
seems to be a growing concern about how trade affects the
environment, about how GATT should address those issues,"
says Eric Christensen, an attorney with the NRDC's
international program.
   And environmentalists increasingly see free trade as the
enemy. Green economic theorist Herman Daly, a World Bank
economist, calls for the U.S. to abandon the free-trade
system and impose stiff tariffs to "greatly reduce the
incentive to produce goods for the American market." He also
criticizes capital mobility even within the country and urges
a sharp reduction in interstate commerce.
   On a more mundane level, attorney Steven Shrybman notes in
the Naderite Multinational Monitor that liberalized trade
policy "will make it more difficult for countries to maintain
or implement tough environmental standards without
undermining the competitiveness of their domestic industry."
   Mr. Shrybman, who is counsel for the Canadian
Environmental Law Association, calls the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement "a disaster, because the environment was
utterly and completely ignored. . . . We lost the ability to
regulate the environment and energy development in Canada."
   Just as international competition provided a powerful
check on the ability of organized labor to raise wages ahead
of productivity, so it promises to restrain environmental
zealotry. And just as labor tried for decades to limit
imports from countries not blessed with an NLRB, so the
eco-protectionists campaign to save American farmers from
foreign pesticide users.
   There is widespread international support for bans on
demonstrably dangerous chemicals and regulation of hazardous
residue levels. But Prop. 128 represents an American
idiosyncrasy, the belief that everything man-made will kill
us. Environmentalists who oppose both trade and chemicals
have every interest in turning that conviction into a trade
barrier.
