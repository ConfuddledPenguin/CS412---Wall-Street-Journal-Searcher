   NEC Corp., a leading Japanese high-technology concern,
said it has agreed to set up related joint ventures in China
to produce integrated circuits and digital telephone
switching systems.
   The deal, the first between a Japanese electronics firm
and China, was initiated in 1988 but suspended after the
Chinese government's crackdown on demonstrators in June 1989.
The project was reopened after Japan's government lifted its
freeze on loans to China in July.

   The agreement, signed by NEC and the Chinese Ministry of
Machinery and Electronics Industry, will become effective
when formal approval is obtained from the Chinese and
Japanese governments.
   Under the deal, a joint venture in Beijing would produce
large-scale integrated circuits jointly with Shoudu Iron and
Steel Co. of China, NEC said. It will be capitalized at the
equivalent of $62 million and 60% of it will be owned by
Shoudu and the rest by NEC, the officials said.
   NEC also will set up a joint venture to produce telephone
switching systems in Tianjin with Tianjin Zhonghuan Computer
Co., Tianjin Post and Telecommunications Administration, both
of China, and Sumitomo Corp., a Japanese trading firm.
   They said the projected venture would be worth $29
million, with the Chinese computer company owning 45%, the
postal authority 15%, NEC 35% and Sumitomo 5%.
