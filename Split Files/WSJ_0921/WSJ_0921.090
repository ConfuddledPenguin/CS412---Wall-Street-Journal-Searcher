   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks swooned as anxieties
about the economy and Persian Gulf tensions continued to
unnerve investors.
   Smaller shares also tracked late-afternoon selling among
exchange-listed stocks related to today's expiration of
September stock-index futures.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 7.25 to 364.43, a 1.95%
drop. Down 2.11 in the first hour of trading, the index's
fall accelerated late in the day. A wave of selling related
to the expiration of stock-index futures pushed the Dow Jones
Industrial Average down more than 50 points before it
recovered to close down 39.11, at 2518.32.
   Nasdaq volume fell to 107.9 million shares from 120.9
million Wednesday as a number of investors and traders were
away for Rosh Hashana, the beginning of the Jewish New Year.
Declining stocks swamped advancers, 1,312 to 498; 217 stocks
fell to new lows as only 12 reached new highs.
   A skittish British market helped fell the American
Depositary Receipts of Reuters Holdings, which tumbled 3 to
40 1/2 on more than two million shares. A variety of rumors
also dogged Reuters issues, but many were denied by the
information services and news concern.
   Robert A. Crooke, spokesman for Reuters America, said in
an interview there's "nothing new" in rumors that the London
futures exchange is reluctant to join Globex, Reuters'
automated after-hours trading system for futures and options.
Mr. Crooke said Reuters hasn't been counting on getting a
contract with the London futures group in making its
projections of future revenue.
   Reuters did announce a reorganization of several product
and information services groups designed to consolidate
operations into fewer groups. Mr. Crooke also denied a rumor
that Reuters managing director Glen Renfrew was ill.
Wednesday, the company announced that Nigel Judah resigned as
finance director because of ill health, but remains company
secretary.
   Centocor fell 1 1/4 to 40 1/2, although a company
spokesman confirmed Centocor is in negotiations to sell the
U.S. Army 200 doses of Centoxin at $2,500 a dose for use in
the Middle East. The Malvern, Pa., biotechnology company is
developing Centoxin to treat septic shock. Centocor had risen
sharply Wednesday on speculation about an Army order.
   Investors bailed out of stocks that are vulnerable to
economic weakness and higher oil prices. Among retailers,
Nordstrom fell 1 to 20 1/2; Liz Claiborne eased 1 to 25 1/4;
and Nike stumbled 2 3/8 to 67 1/2. Among transportation
stocks, Yellow Freight skidded 1 3/8 to 19 7/8; Roadway
Services slipped 3/4 to 29; and Alexander &amp; Baldwin fell 1
1/2 to 22 3/4.
   Nordstrom was among the day's most-active stocks as more
than 1.3 million shares changed hands. Montgomery Securities
analyst Edward A. Weller lowered his estimate for the
retailer's fiscal 1991 third quarter ending in October to
project flat or lower earnings compared with the year-earlier
earnings of 27 cents a share. Nordstrom's chief financial
officer, John Goesling, said other analysts also have lowered
their expectations for the Seattle company amid softening
retail demand.
   Michael Foods slipped 1 to 16 7/8 after North Star
Universal said it lowered its stake in the Minneapolis food
processor and distributor to 51% from 53.8%. North Star,
which eased 1/8 to 5 5/8, also said it plans to sell two of
its own units.
   Dell Computer lost 5/8 to 10 1/4 after Texas Instruments
filed a lawsuit against the Austin, Texas, company for
alleged patent infringement.
   Other stocks fell as companies grappled with bleak
financial and consumer markets.
   C-Cor Electronics plummeted 2 1/2 to 5. The State College,
Pa., maker of cable television equipment said it expects to
report a loss for the first quarter ending this month. C-Cor
attributed a slowdown in orders to regulatory and financial
uncertainties in the cable television industry.
   Diversco sank 1/4 to 3 after the Spartanburg, S.C.,
provider of contract personnel services said it decided not
to seek a merger because of market conditions.
   Concord Camera plunged 5/8 to 2 1/2. The Avanel, N.J.,
photographic equipment company said that it failed to meet a
number of financial covenants in its bank loan agreement, but
said it hopes to get a waiver on the defaults.
   Concord Camera also reported a loss for the fourth quarter
ended in June of 57 cents a share, compared with year-earlier
net income of seven cents a share. Chairman and Chief
Financial Officer Jack C. Benun attributed the loss partly to
"wrongful actions" by certain former officers and directors
of a Hong Kong subsidiary, which resulted in disrupted
manufacturing operations and re-evaluation of certain
inventories. The subsidiary has since been reorganized.
   Cedar Group eased 1/8 to 2 7/8. The Philadelphia company
said late Wednesday that it is renegotiating terms of its
plan to acquire Gardenbolt International because of the
recent decline in its own stock.
   ClothesTime swooned 1/4 to 1 7/8. Wednesday, the Anaheim,
Calif., maker of women's apparel estimated that earnings for
the fiscal year ending in January will range from one cent to
five cents a share, compared with the prior year's three
cents.
   First Florida Banks slipped 1 1/2 to 14 1/4.
   Mid-State Federal Savings said Wednesday that it plans a
special shareholder meeting Oct. 18 to consider its proposed
acquisition of First Florida.
   Among the day's few gainers, Braintree Savings Bank jumped
1 to 5 after the Braintree, Mass., financial institution
declared its regular quarterly dividend of nine cents a
share.
   Ithaca Bancorp added 1 to 6 3/4. Tuesday, the Ithaca,
N.Y., financial institution, said that its formation as the
holding company for Citizens Savings Bank had been completed
and that it will begin to buy back as much as 10% of its
stock.
   Fidelity Federal Savings Bank of Marion, Ind., jumped 2 to
16. The financial institution said late Monday that its
acquisition by First Financial Bancorp. of Monroe, Ohio,
could occur as early as today.
