   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled in moderate trading, with
selling related to the expiration of September stock-index
futures and options doing much of the damage.
   Continuing worries about the economy and the Middle East
situation weighed on the market as well, traders said.
"Nobody wants to have an unpleasant surprise," said Edward E.
Collins III, executive vice president of institutional
trading at Daiwa Securities America.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 39.11 to 2518.32,
and declining issues routed advancers by a margin of 1,258 to
300.
   Among broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
fell 5.12 to 311.48, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 2.69 to 171.22 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index went down 4.73 to 288.57.
   While many market players were absent in observance of
Rosh Hashana, the beginning of the Jewish New Year, trading
activity remained at the moderate pace of the prior two
sessions. Big Board volume totaled 145,100,000 shares,
compared with 147,530,000 shares Wednesday and 141,130,000
shares Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones industrials fell about 46 points in the
first hour of trading amid waves of program selling linked to
stock-index arbitrage, involving the purchase of index
futures and the sale of baskets of stocks to profit from
price differences between them.
   The index arbitrage took effect after index-futures
selling in advance of today's quarterly expiration -- also
known as the "triple witching hour" -- drove down the value
of the futures in comparison with the underlying indexes.
   A late wave of arbitrage selling helped push the
industrial average to a loss of more than 50 points,
prompting the Big Board to implement its "uptick" rule on
index arbitrage-related selling. From 3:36 p.m. EDT to the
close of trading, stock sales tied to index arbitrage
couldn't be completed if the issues involved were dropping in
price.
   The prospect of further volatility as the September
contracts expire today kept many investors on the sidelines,
traders said.
   The market's slide toward its late-August lows led to some
selling by institutional investors. "The institutions have
been waiting for rallies, and they're tired of waiting. At
the slightest hint of anything wrong they're just laying into
{stocks}," said Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical
research at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Advancers were almost nonexistent on the list of the Big
Board's most active issues. General Electric, which fell 1/2
to 55 1/8, topped the list with composite volume of 3.3
million shares. PepsiCo, which slipped 5/8 to 22 3/4,
finished second with 2.6 million shares; and Philip Morris,
third among the most actives, lost 1 to 45 on 2.1 million
shares.
   Gillette tumbled 3 1/2 to 51 1/8. Salomon Brothers lowered
the stock's investment rating, citing an "increasing
conviction" in earnings estimates for 1990 and 1991 that fall
short of other firms' forecasts.
   Digital Equipment fell 1 7/8 to 53 3/4 and traded as low
as 53, setting another five-year low. Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
slashed its earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending next
June by $3.25 a share, to $1.50; at least 17 analysts have
cut back forecasts on Digital in the past two weeks.
   Investors continued to dump shares of MBIA, which dropped
3 to 25 1/2; over the past three sessions, the municipal-bond
insurer's stock has lost nearly 10 points.
   Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal's "Heard on the Street"
column said traders are nervous about the possibility of
defaults by issuers of tax-exempt bonds, such as the
financially strapped city of Philadelphia. If such a default
were to occur, the companies that insure municipal bonds
would take a hit, the Journal said. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty
dipped 3/4 to 40 7/8, Fund American fell 1 3/8 to 43 1/2 and
Cigna went down 5/8 to 41 3/8; all three insurance firms hold
large stakes in MBIA.
   American General, which plunged 6 3/8 Wednesday after
saying it may sell only its home-service life insurance
operations instead of the entire company, dropped an
additional 3/4 to 32 7/8 on 1.7 million shares. Among other
insurance issues, American International Group dropped 1 7/8
to 63 5/8, General Re fell 1 1/4 to 72 3/4, USF&amp;G dropped 1
1/4 to 19 5/8 and Torchmark lost 1 1/8 to 43 5/8.
   Among 82 industry groups tracked by Dow Jones, only two --
precious metals and water utilities -- closed higher. Battle
Mountain Gold rose 1/8 to 10 1/4 and Hecla Mining went up 1/8
to 10 1/8. Among water utilities, Hydraulic rose 1/4 to 20
3/4, American Water Works ended unchanged at 14 3/8 and
United Water Resources closed unchanged at 11 5/8.
   Apple Bancorp jumped 5 1/2 to 36 3/8. Its board removed an
obstacle to the $38-a-share takeover offer from Stanley
Stahl, a New York real estate investor, by agreeing to
terminate two trusts created to block the proposal.
   UAL rose 2 1/4 to 102 1/4. A group of unions at the
company's United Airlines unit asked 26 banks to decide by
Oct. 3 whether they will help finance a new $175-a-share
buy-out bid.
   International Multifoods went up 1/2 to 29 1/8 after
Archer-Daniels-Midland disclosed that it had raised its stake
in the company to 9.43%. Archer-Daniels closed unchanged at
24.
   Martin Marietta, which completed a $42.5 million sale of
property in Orlando, Fla., rose 1/2 to 38 1/2. The company
sold the real estate to three groups of investors, which it
didn't identify.
   Computer Factory jumped 1 to 3 1/8. Bay Street Group, a
San Francisco-based merchant banker, offered $4 a share for
the company.
   MGI Properties skidded 1 3/4 to 8 1/8 after cutting its
quarterly dividend by eight cents a share, to 20 cents, and
reporting that earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in
August dropped 22% from a year ago.
   BMC Industries, which said it expects a third-quarter loss
of about 25 cents a share, fell 3/4 to 6. The company also
forecast that earnings for the year would be down about 15%
from the 1989 level.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.79
to 317.18. Volume totaled 12,390,000 shares.
