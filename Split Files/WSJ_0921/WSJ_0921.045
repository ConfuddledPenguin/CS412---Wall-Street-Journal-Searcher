   PARIS -- The French drinks, perfume and baggage group LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. said consolidated profit
climbed 23% in the first half of 1990 and predicted that its
full-year results will show a gain of at least 15%.
   Profit for the half rose to 1.25 billion French francs
($237.2 million) from 1.02 billion francs a year earlier,
even though revenue rose only 2.2% to 8.82 billion francs
from 8.63 billion francs and operating profit slipped 0.9% to
2.33 billion francs from 2.36 billion francs.

   LVMH said the slow growth in revenue and the decline in
operating profit resulted from the French franc's weakness
against some other major currencies. The higher consolidated
profit figure, it said, took into account the results of its
currency-hedging program. It said that after adjustment for
currency factors, operating profit showed a 25% gain for the
period.
   "The group benefited from very strong growth in all of its
Far Eastern businesses, particularly in Japan, which offset a
slowdown of growth in the U.S.," the company said. It also
cited lower financing costs and its 24% stake in the British
drinks group Guinness PLC, which has just posted a 31%
increase in its first-half earnings.
   By sectors, cognac and spirits were the strongest
contributors to first-half operating profit, generating a 22%
rise to 1.1 billion francs from 900 million francs. LVMH said
the sector had strong demand growth world-wide, especially in
Asia.
   On the other hand, operating profit from perfumes and
beauty products fell 47% to 138 million francs from 258
million.
