   In their never-ending search for perfection, journalists
recently have been trying to replace lawyers as this
country's most irresponsible (and accordingly
least-respected) profession. The task is formidable, but they
seem to be succeeding.
   Perhaps the worst symptom of the problem is the outpouring
of pious indignation that accompanies any attempt to force
moderation. This was amazingly clear in the appalling example
of journalistic elitism that recently appeared on your op-ed
page: Michael Gartner, president of NBC News, in his Aug. 30
Viewpoint column, "Covering the War Is CENSORED," observed
that he was understandably upset because the Pentagon
wouldn't allow his organization to disclose troop strengths,
installations, weaponry, security precautions, deployments or
other newsworthy tidbits of information. No matter that such
reporting would endanger the allied forces, especially when
coupled with the usual expert analysis detailing the best
ways of countering such measures.

   America owes its enviable standards of domestic
tranquillity and economic prosperity to a relatively
non-oppressive government -- a government held in check by a
free and vital press. It is impossible to overstate the
importance of journalism in preserving our freedoms and
maintaining our way of life.
   However, the press can continue to serve in this crucial
role only if it is credible. Credibility requires
responsibility. Responsibility requires self-discipline --
enough self-control to prevent oneself from being turned into
a stooge, from divulging important military information, or
from otherwise giving aid and comfort to a ruthless enemy.

   Every one of the categories of information Mr. Gartner
lists as prohibited would be useful to a military adversary
and could, in the event of war, contribute to loss of U.S.
lives and material.
   Had attitudes such as his prevailed in the press corps
during World War II, we might have lost that conflict, and
with it all First Amendment rights for everyone.

   As a retired USAF pilot who, even after a 22-year absence
from the cockpit, would like to be there, I sure as hell
would not want the bad guys to know who I was, where I was
located, where my family lived, how many planes, missiles,
spare parts, etc. we had available and, very importantly,
what security and perimeter defenses were built to protect me
while I was on the ground.

   I'm pleased that the irresponsibility of the media in
times of crisis is being handled effectively.

   The Saudi desert is a big place. It is important for me to
know that we may have as many as 250,000 personnel in that
sandbox and that they've got the right equipment. But I'm
happy believing that if NBC can't tell me the latitude and
longitude of Cpl. Smith (and, by extension, his unit),
neither can it tell the Iraqi commanders.

   Restrictions placed on the press, and all good citizens,
were initial restrictions, for the safety and security of our
men and women in the armed services. Such restrictions were
put in place in World War II so the enemy would not know that
the Fourth Infantry Division was to land on Utah Beach on
D-Day; the First Division to land on Omaha Beach and the 82nd
Airborne &amp; 10th Airborne to drop in the vicinity of St. Mere
Eglise. All identification had been covered up or removed
from men and equipment.
   When it comes to a military operation, my money is on
trained professionals in the Defense Department. They're
responsible for the lives of our armed forces, not the
self-serving media. Mr. Gartner may cry all he wants, but the
real tears will be shed if we lose any of our fine young
soldiers. Let's hope and pray we don't.

   No doubt the media is at war. They are always at war, and
always the first to declare war. After all, the main product
of the media has become reporting "war" -- war on drugs, war
on poverty, war on peace. Now, we have scowling
correspondents deployed to Saudi Arabia, where they
breathlessly convert a truly boring tour of duty into what
they consider entertaining and informative reporting. All
complete with a background mosque or military base, mingled
with an editorial dose of footage from the Iranian/Iraqi war
archives -- with fly-covered civilian and military victims,
along with footage of our forces on exercise in the Mojave or
Twenty-Nine Palms. Turn the sound off and one would swear
this was indeed a real war being reported on. I imagine that
when colorized World War II footage of the North African
campaign becomes available, it too will be worked in.

   Our military has an obligation to keep its activities
secret; these are our sons and daughters whose lives are at
stake.
   What Mr. Gartner is really complaining about is that the
U.S. media has proved that it cannot police itself, not only
in regard to military secrets but in all other types of
reporting, and that the U.S. military has learned to react
accordingly.

   By Mr. Gartner's own account, media restrictions in Saudi
Arabia relate entirely to legitimate military secrets (size,
location and security precautions of military units) and the
personal safety of U.S. soldiers and their families
(names/hometowns).
   He insults the public's intelligence when he implies that
concealing those details will undermine democratic control of
U.S. foreign policy.
   In no way is the name of an air base or the number of
trucks in a convoy crucial information for policy making.
Such details are, however, invaluable to the guys aiming
Iraqi Scud missiles.
   If his reporters can't find something else worth
reporting, perhaps he needs new reporters. Or he could just
watch CNN -- like the rest of us.

   The military buildup is not "undebated," as Mr. Gartner
argues. Every day, the major U.S. dailies devote three to
five full pages to covering it, and the op-ed pages are
filled with opinion columns. It has completely dominated the
U.S. public-policy debate for the past few weeks.
   This concept that the media has a right to know and
broadcast anything they wish, and that preventing them from
doing so in military situations is an infringement of their
rights, is preposterous. As a viewer and reader, I would
prefer not to know information I don't need to know than
endanger the lives of those who have been sent on this
mission.
