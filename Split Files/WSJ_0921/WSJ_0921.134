   NORWALK, Conn. -- Perkin-Elmer Corp. said its chairman and
chief executive officer, Horace G. McDonell, will retire in
early November at age 62.
   Mr. McDonell, who led the company through its most recent
restructuring, will be succeeded by Gaynor N. Kelley, 59,
president and chief operating officer.

   The move comes near the end of the company's most
extensive restructuring program, which saw the divestiture of
businesses that generated more than $500 million in revenue,
most prominently its semiconductor business. That left the
maker of analytical instruments more narrowly focused and
slightly more profitable.
   Mr. Kelley, in an interview, said he doesn't expect to
deviate from the course set by Mr. McDonell. "I'm not
interested in a diversification strategy," Mr. Kelley said.
He noted that his challenge would be to increase sales and
profit from the analytical instruments business, which
currently generates more than $800 million in annual sales.
   But he said he has thought about an "aggressive position
on acquisitions" in which he would seek similar businesses.
   Some analysts said Mr. Kelley will take a more hands-on
approach to management than Mr. McDonell. He will also face
tremendous pressure to increase profit for the company, which
has had several years of sluggish growth.
   Perkin-Elmer said Mr. McDonell, who was elected chairman
in 1985, will continue to serve as director after retirement.
The company also said it was eliminating the position of
chief operating officer, as Mr. Kelley will serve as
chairman, president and chief executive.
