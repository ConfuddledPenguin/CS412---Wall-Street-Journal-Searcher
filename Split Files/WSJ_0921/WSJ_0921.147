   WASHINGTON -- President Bush said he will nominate Branko
Terzic, vice president of a Milwaukee consulting firm, to
fill a vacant seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
   Mr. Terzic, if confirmed by the Senate, would serve until
Oct. 20, 1991, filling out the remainder of the term of
former chairwoman Martha Hesse, who left late last year.

   In addition to being group vice president of AUS
Consultants in Milwaukee, Mr. Terzic, a Republican, is
chairman of the Wisconsin Racing Board. He also has served a
six-year term on the Wisconsin Public Service Commission.
   An aide to the Senate Energy Committee said lawmakers hope
to act on the nomination before Congress adjourns next month.
In that case, Mr. Terzic could be on board for the
commission's vote, scheduled for Nov. 28, on the
controversial Iroquois natural gas pipeline project. The
proposed 369 mile, $582.6 million pipeline is designed to
bring Canadian gas to the Northeastern U.S.
