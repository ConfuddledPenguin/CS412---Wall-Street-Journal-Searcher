   For the world's finance ministers assembling in Washington
this weekend, the looming economic problem isn't an oil
shortage but a capital shortage.
   Japan and West Germany, which provided the two great
reservoirs of capital that fueled the world economy in the
1980s, now face domestic problems that are draining those
reservoirs dry. Meanwhile, the ever-growing U.S. budget
deficit continues to siphon off the capital that remains
available.

   The upshot: a global monetary squeeze that threatens to
keep interest rates high and economic growth low.
   "We're in a world-wide credit crunch," says Barton Biggs,
chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "That's why
interest rates and international credit rates are as high as
they are." The crunch is likely to dominate the talk at next
week's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
   For the U.S., which became addicted to foreign capital
over the past decade, a global capital shortage could have
profound effects. Already, foreign investors from Tokyo to
Turin are avoiding U.S. securities. In the first half of
1990, they unloaded a net $7 billion of U.S. stocks and
slashed their net purchases of U.S. bonds by 48% from a year
earlier.
   And despite widespread fear that foreigners are buying up
America, direct investment in U.S. real estate and factories
has plunged to a third of last year's pace, according to the
Commerce Department.
   At the same time, Americans are investing more heavily
overseas. If first-half trends continue, Americans will buy a
net $62 billion of foreign stocks, bonds, real estate, and
plant and equipment this year, up 16% from last year.
"Foreign buyers are turning skeptical toward U.S.
investments, and U.S. investors are starting to vote with
their feet," says Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon
Brothers in New York.
   Investors' mad dash out of the U.S. is partly the natural
result of a weak economy. With consumer and business spending
stagnant, the U.S. needs less capital now than it did during
the mid-1980s boom. If a full-fledged recession hits, sagging
demand could push down interest rates despite the global
credit squeeze.
   The capital crunch still might hobble the U.S. economy. At
the very least, interest rates won't fall as fast as they
would if capital were plentiful. Spending by businesses,
farmers, home and auto buyers and even financially strapped
governmental bodies could be damped, and an economic recovery
could be delayed.
   Many of the troublesome global trends were at work before
Iraq marched into Kuwait. The Mideast crisis, however, has
aggravated the resulting problems.
   The biggest change has come in Tokyo, once a seemingly
endless fountain of capital for the world. The recent plunge
in Tokyo's stock market is eroding the foundations beneath
Japan's behemoth banks, which, unlike U.S. banks, are allowed
to hold stock and to count up to 45% of the unrealized gains
on those stockholdings as part of their capital. With the
value of those holdings cut sharply, the banks are scrambling
to replace the lost capital.
   "It's a harsh situation," says an analyst at Nikko
Securities Co. So severe is the need for capital that
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Japan's fourth-largest, is thinking of
selling a stake in its wholly owned Bank of California
subsidiary.
   Moreover, Japanese banks are revamping their businesses
and talking about slashing lending. If they do, the Nikko
analyst predicts, cutbacks would be sharpest in offshore
markets, where the banks face foreign-exchange risk as well
as strong interest-rate competition and thin margins. At the
moment, Japanese banks, which hold 12% of U.S. bank assets
and substantial amounts in Europe, do nearly half of all
cross-border lending.
   "They're concerned that they don't disrupt their domestic
operations; so, they're looking overseas," says J. Brian
Waterhouse, a banking analyst in Tokyo for James Capel &amp; Co.,
a British securities firm. The result: less capital and
higher borrowing costs world-wide, he says.
   Already, according to the Ministry of Finance, Japanese
investors have pulled $8.9 billion out of the U.S. stock and
bond markets in the first six months of this year. That
retreat marked a dramatic reversal of net capital flows in
the five previous years, when $180.98 billion in Japanese
money poured into the U.S.
   For some U.S. borrowers, the Japanese problems are hitting
home quickly. Last month, a credit-rating agency downgraded
two of Japan's biggest banks, Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., and earlier this week Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it was reviewing for possible downgrading
the long-term ratings of three more Japanese banks, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., Mitsubishi Bank and Tokai Bank
Ltd. Such downgradings could be important to hundreds of
American municipalities, which rely on the high credit
standings of big Japanese banks to generate low-cost loans;
the banks, in effect, guarantee the borrowings.
   "A big transition is taking place," says Nobuyuki Ueda,
senior economist at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "The
public will still be able to get money from Japan -- if they
are willing to pay."
   Chase Manhattan Corp., the New York bank holding company,
also felt the squeeze recently when it tried to tap the Tokyo
market for $100 million in capital. The effort foundered in a
flood of similar fund raisings by capital-hungry Japanese
banks. And at a U.S. Treasury refunding in August, Japanese
investors took only a fraction of the bonds they normally
buy.
   Some in Japan worry that conditions could deteriorate
further, particularly if the nation's sky-high real-estate
values fall to earth. "Sooner or later, banks are going to
have to sell off assets, and if they do that, stock prices
will go down further," says Kazuo Nukazawa, a managing
director of Keidanren, Japan's powerful federation of
economic organizations. "Then, land prices will be affected.
If it's too quick, that will affect the stability of the
entire financial system, not only in this country {Japan} but
in the U.S."
   Indeed, the land question is what most rattles analysts.
"The banks' experience in the real-estate market is very
similar to the experience with the Third World countries,
which have accumulated large amounts of debt," says Long-Term
Credit Bank's Mr. Ueda. "They cannot retreat. If they try to
pull out their money, it will result in a very serious
problem for the whole world."
   In Europe, the capital shortage began emerging early this
year, when West Germany committed itself to economic
integration with East Germany. Even before Iraq invaded
Kuwait, West Germany foresaw massive government outlays --
about $40 billion this year and $55 billion next year -- to
bail out the East. That's enough to devour the excess capital
that Germany has been shipping overseas.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis, higher oil prices have
pushed up those numbers rapidly. Chase Investment Bank, a
London unit of Chase Manhattan, now puts the German bailout
cost closer to $54 billion this year and $76 billion next
year.
   Already affected is the much-ballyhooed tunnel under the
English Channel. In a bit of bad timing, the Anglo-French
project approached its bank syndicate last month in search of
nearly $4 billion in new credit. The banks, shaken by events
in the Gulf, hesitated. The talks continue, and officials say
the misgivings can't be blamed entirely on the Mideast. But
"it has made it more difficult," one banker says.
   Nowhere is the tightening supply of credit felt more
surely than in the U.S. -- the world's leading credit junkie.
Because Americans save so little, the nation has only a small
pool of its own capital to draw on. And that pool is sucked
nearly dry by the unquenchable thirst of a debt-ridden
federal government.
   The latest administration estimates have the U.S.
borrowing $250 billion next year to fund the deficit, and
some private analysts say a recession could push that over
$350 billion. That leaves little money to finance private
investment unless foreign lenders pitch in. Throughout the
1980s, they happily obliged, and their capital flowed freely
to the U.S.
   The world, however, has changed. Now, many foreigners say
they have better things to do with their money than invest it
in the U.S. "We have had a very small dollar exposure over
the last 12 to 18 months," says Heinrich Looser, a senior
vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. in Zurich. Instead,
the bank has been investing in European currencies such as
the German mark, Dutch gilder and French franc.
   "We have been very bullish on these currencies because of
the free Europe: the reintegration of the East into Europe,
the whole economic upswing that is expected from the fall of
the Berlin Wall last November and the investment
opportunities arising from free-European markets," Mr. Looser
says. Shrinking tariff barriers, uniform manufacturing
standards and the free flow of capital expected to result
from the "unification" of the 12-nation European Community in
1992, he adds, "will increase efficiencies and produce
superior investment results."
   As investors flee the U.S., the dollar has dropped. Since
the end of 1989, it is off 7% against the mark, 4% against
the yen and 14% against the British pound. And many
economists and currency traders are betting that the U.S.
currency will fall even more in the next few months. The
prospects of such a drop could further deter foreigners from
buying U.S. securities.
   For the U.S. government, the capital flight poses a
painful dilemma. With a possible recession looming,
administration officials want the Federal Reserve to ease
credit and try to stimulate the economy. The Treasury keeps
calling on the Fed to cut short-term interest rates.
   Yet, lower short-term rates in the U.S. would send more
foreign investors scurrying back overseas, where rates remain
high. It also would raise fears that the Fed is abandoning
its battle against inflation. The result would be even less
capital from abroad and a still-lower dollar. So, the Fed has
been hesitant to move.
   The Treasury's desire for a looser monetary policy and its
casual attitude toward the depreciating dollar already are
setting it at loggerheads with some other major
industrialized nations. At a recent meeting in Paris, the
major European countries, in particular, opposed any easing.
That debate is expected to continue tomorrow at another
meeting of the industrialized nations' officials in
Washington.
   In testimony to Congress this week, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan left no doubt about the seriousness
of the capital shortage. The amount of foreign savings
available to the U.S. "has been declining," he said. "We
can't count on {foreign savings} indefinitely in the future."
The need to improve the savings rate in the U.S. and to
reduce the dependence on foreign capital "may well be the
most important long-term policy issue that confronts this
country," he said.
   His solution: "At a minimum," the U.S. should "bring the
federal budget deficit down and reduce its drain on" savings.
   The U.S. administration and Congress continue negotiations
on a deal that would cut the deficit by about $50 billion
next year and $500 billion over the next five years. Michael
Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, says a "credible growth-oriented budget deal" would
encourage investors and "buoy the dollar." That, in turn,
might allow the Fed to ease credit.
   Even with a budget deal reducing the U.S. drain on global
capital, the supply of funds is likely to remain tight. And
so, many analysts are on edge. "I'm extremely worried," says
Rimmer de Vries, chief economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
"There are elements of a hard landing in the picture: little
growth, rising inflation, budget problems and a somewhat
weaker dollar. I don't think that's a soft landing."
