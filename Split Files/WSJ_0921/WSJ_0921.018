   Nearly everyone is saying the census is a flop, but
everyone is wrong. If a successful census is one that counts
all the people, then the 1990 census is as close to a success
as we can reasonably expect.
   The first two phases of the census operation are complete
-- the mailing out and mailing back of questionnaires and the
personal visits by enumerators. By the end of July, the
Census Bureau had contacted more than 99% of all known
addresses, and had more than 99 million completed
questionnaires in its computer. Now the census safety nets
are in place, and the census effort has both the time and the
resources for them to function effectively.

   Late last month, the Census Bureau sent preliminary counts
of housing units, by block, to nearly 40,000 counties, cities
and other local governments to check for accuracy. These
groups are complaining just as loudly as the public did in
the spring -- the numbers are below everyone's estimates,
including the Census Bureau's. But that's the point of the
process. The bureau will recanvass blocks where local
officials disagree with the counts. This procedure was too
rushed in 1980 to be effective, but if local officials do
their jobs, there's enough time for it to work this year.
   At the same time, the bureau is using its new Management
Information System to integrate information about missing
housing units, and to target blocks for recanvassing. All
those press accounts of missing units have been fed into the
system, as well as information received from calls to the
bureau's hotline, letters from individuals and community
groups, and information from the Postal Service.
   Census Bureau Director Barbara Everitt Bryant told a
congressional hearing last month that "statistical sample
checks show no evidence of large blocks of missing housing
units." But when a newspaper wrote that housing units in one
city were reportedly misclassified as containing only one
person, the bureau used the MIS to search for excessive
occurrences of one-person households nationwide. As a result,
Ms. Bryant said, interviewers were sent back to 58,000
households in nine census districts. The numbers local
officials are reviewing now don't include any of these
corrections.
   These and similar procedures will probably produce a
census count that is as complete as we have ever seen. The
public doesn't think that's happening because it looks at
specific instances where the basic procedures fail and then
projects that failure onto the whole. But the reality is that
the basic procedures can't work on their own any more. In a
complex society, it takes a bundle of procedures to produce a
complete count of the population.
   The mail census is the cheapest procedure: It counts the
share of the population that is willing and able to
cooperate. That share is evidently declining, and not just
among the general public. The Direct Marketing Association
reported last month that an embarrassingly low fraction of
its members cooperated with the government's request to avoid
mailings around Census Day.
   Personal visits -- the classic census procedure -- are
expensive but inevitable when so many households lack
English-language facility, literacy skills or familiarity
with filling out questionnaires, particularly wordy
government efforts like the census questionnaire. And there
are always households that are not willing to be counted. Now
that the census is computerized, we have a better chance of
counting them. That's why this census will probably be a
success -- if you define success as counting just about
everybody.
   However, if you define success as a complete and accurate
array of information about just about everybody, then the
census is less successful. About 3% of the housing units now
recorded in the census data base contain what the bureau
calls "last-resort" information. This means that the bureau
made up to six attempts to contact people in person or on the
phone. When that failed, census-takers got information from
neighbors, letter carriers or building superintendents. In
some cases, people hadn't provided all the information
requested; in other cases they hadn't provided any.
   Although the nationwide use of last-resort information
isn't terribly significant, it is significant in larger
cities -- that's where the basic procedures seem increasingly
inadequate. According to Ms. Bryant, preliminary data for New
York City, in particular, suggest that last-resort data may
have been substituted for more than the usual hard-to-count
populations. That would explain why so many New Yorkers think
they haven't been counted: Someone else provided information
for them.
   The use of last-resort data obviously reduced the number
of people who had been expected to answer the long, detailed
census questionnaire. So did other emergency procedures. For
example, all people who chose to give their census
information over the telephone hotlines were administered the
short form. Evelyn Mann, New York City's chief demographer,
says this situation "thinned" the detailed data, and biases
those tabulations toward the characteristics of people who
cooperated with the census.
   New York City may be a special case, but it may also
signal the census-taking environment of the future. That
raises the ultimate question about the success of the census:
its cost-effectiveness. According to the General Accounting
Office, the cost of counting each housing unit (in 1980
dollars) rose from $5 in 1950 to $12 in 1980. Due in part to
the unexpectedly low public cooperation, it will reach an
estimated $17 per unit in 1990.
   Let's leave to the political arena the issue of whether
the government should adjust census results for people who
slip through the bureau's safety nets. Thanks to computerized
statistical firepower, this census will probably produce the
best estimates yet of how many of them there are.
