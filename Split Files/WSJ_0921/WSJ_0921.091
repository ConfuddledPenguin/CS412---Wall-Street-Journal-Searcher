   NEW YORK -- The program trading "witch" and surging oil
prices conspired to send stock prices tumbling.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.11 points in
moderate trading to 2518.32. October crude-oil futures
contracts jumped $1.53 a barrel to $34.71, which also helped
push bonds lower. The dollar edged up, with little news to
guide traders.

   Another decline in the Tokyo stock market and routs in
European markets set the tone for the U.S. stock market.
Tokyo's Nikkei Index fell only 0.52%, but yesterday was the
second consecutive day that the index hit a low for the year.
Stocks in London and West Germany both dropped under previous
post-Kuwait invasion lows, set Aug. 23.
   The Dow Jones industrials started sharply lower in the
first hour of trading as index players bought futures and
sold stocks ahead of today's triple expirations of options on
individual stocks, and futures and options on Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index, the New York Stock Exchange composite
and the Major Market Index. This quarterly event is known as
the "triple witching hour."
   But some analysts think the program traders got the
selling out of their system yesterday. "Usually the
volatility occurs a day or so early" when the indexes are
trading at a discount to the underlying stocks as the
expiration date nears, said A.C. Moore, research director at
Argus Research.
   On top of that, "there's growing concern about the banking
problem, and there's a lack of any good news," said Susan Del
Signore, stock trader at Travelers Investment Management. She
said that yesterday she was getting "the most negative calls
I've gotten since I've been in this business. People are
losing heart."
   In addition to banks' health, said Thomas Walsh, head of
equity trading at Nikko Securities International, investors
are being turned off by "the potential of 6% inflation and of
a fairly major recession."
   Some of the oil-price rise came from technical trading
related to yesterday's expiration of the October oil futures
contract. Adding to the surge was a World Bank statement that
a Mideast war could nearly double oil prices to $65 a barrel.
   Those comments, and reports that some congressional
leaders might try to delay automatic spending cuts pending a
negotiated budget plan, sent bonds lower.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices sank. Volume was 145.1 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange. Declining issues swamped advancers,
1,258 to 300.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose to 9.03%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was higher. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5773 marks, up from 1.5715
Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar rose slightly to
137.65 from 137.52.
