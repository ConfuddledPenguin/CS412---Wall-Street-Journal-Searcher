   NEW YORK -- American Express Co.'s publishing unit will
distribute a new magazine this fall on college campuses,
testing a market where several others have flunked out.
   The company this week is mailing the first issue of a new
quarterly called Connections to 600,000 students on 600
campuses who are holders of its American Express card. Like
other so-called custom magazines, the magazine is free and
offers its advertisers, Nissan Motor Co. and Apple Computer
Inc., exclusive sponsorship arrangements.

   Connections is the second project spawned by the Custom
Media Group of American Express Publishing, a unit of
American Express Co. The Custom Media Group is also
publishing Your Company, a magazine sent out for the first
time this week to one million American Express corporate-card
holders who run small businesses. Your Company's major
sponsors are International Business Machines Corp., Cigna
Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc.
   College campuses have been a graveyard for major magazine
publishers in recent years. Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek,
Time Warner Inc. and Whittle Communications L.P. have all
folded their college magazines, largely because of a lack of
advertising support. Only Whittle returned to campuses with a
new magazine for women called In View, which is distributed
on 926 campuses; it is published five times during the school
year and sponsored by Maybelline Co.
   But American Express officials say the use of their
cardholder lists for distribution is an advantage, and that
such custom magazines represent a stable publishing
arrangement. Nissan and Apple pay in advance to sponsor
Connections, covering all costs and providing a "locked-in
profit level," said Thomas O. Ryder, president of American
Express Publishing. There is, however, a history of sponsors
suddenly withdrawing support, resulting in the swift
disappearance of such magazines.
   Both Connections and Your Company use two of the latest
magazine publishing innovations: "demographic" binding of ads
and ink-jet printing. In the case of Connections, certain ads
from Nissan and Apple can be bound in issues sent, for
example, to students at "classier" schools or those who
travel a lot, while different ads go elsewhere, said Paul D.
Wolff, publisher of Connections and vice president of Custom
Media. Ink-jet printing allows a sponsor's local dealer to
print personal messages on the magazine.
   Mary Simons, editor in chief of Connections, said the
magazine will primarily carry service articles that tell
students how to do such things as land a job or ski on a snow
board. "We stay away from sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll," she
said.
   Mr. Ryder said the new custom magazines represent a new
source of revenue for the company, which is scaling back its
plans to acquire city and regional magazines. "We aren't
leaving behind city magazines, we just aren't on the street
buying {magazines}," he said.
   Magazine Publishers of America, a trade group, said the
three best-selling magazines in college bookstores in 1989
were Hearst Corp.'s Cosmopolitan, Conde Nast Publications'
Glamour and Time Warner Inc.'s People.
