   KARLOVY VARY, Czechoslovakia -- Robert Zbiral, an engineer
at the Great Sokolov Chemical Works near here, greets a
visitor to the five-story plant that is the heart of this
sprawling industrial complex.
   "You've come to see the museum?" he says sarcastically,
pointing to the soot-covered building, which looks abandoned
with its broken windows and peeling cement walls.

   Inside, a nightmarish scene unfolds. Dark pipes run into a
billboard-sized furnace built in the 1930s. Trudging workers
leave footprints in the thick, black dust. There is a roar
high overhead as coal is dumped from hoppers dangling from a
funicular, an obsolete arrangement dating from the plant's
opening in 1917. "All this was fine in its day, but that day
is long past," says Mr. Zbiral, surrounded by pipes whose
ancient insulation has been replaced with aluminum foil kept
in place by chicken wire.
   Miroslav Krejci, the factory's director, says he "would
love to change" to natural-gas fuel for the factory, which
makes low-tech products like formic acid, as well as
acrylics. Such a switch could cut costs by one-third,
eliminate three-quarters of the staff in some departments and
sharply reduce the highly sulfuric dust emissions that have
killed a quarter of the spruce forests in nearby parts of
Bohemia. "But we haven't got the money," he says, adding that
modernizing the plant would cost $125 million at current
exchange rates.
   Then he adds a more telling caveat: "Such a big decision,
affecting many people, would have to be taken by the state."
   Nearly a year after this nation's peaceful overthrow of
Communist rule, Mr. Krejci's deference to the government's
will in running his factory seems startling. After all, isn't
such management freedom part of the reason for last winter's
momentous movement toward liberty across Eastern Europe?
Freed from the oppressive constraints of central planning,
individuals and companies were supposed to flood economies
here with new ideas for small businesses, higher efficiency
and better production. The revolution was supposed to lead to
an entrepreneurial renaissance.
   But it hasn't happened yet.
   What's slowing Eastern Europe's rush to Western-style
capitalism? One thing is lack of money. Billions of dollars
will be needed to overcome years of neglect, and large
injections of foreign capital will be necessary to bring the
Eastern European economies back to life. Second, those
economies haven't yet fully shaken off the shackles of
centralization, which creates economic bottlenecks and
subsidizes inefficiencies. And -- perhaps most important --
40 years of communism has hardened the attitudinal arteries
of the people, stifling initiative.
   Here in Czechoslovakia, there is greater civil and
economic liberty since last November's so-called Velvet
Revolution, yet important elements of daily life persist much
as before. The reformist government of President Vaclav Havel
is trying to get rid of central planning and other
restrictions, but that effort is far from complete. Too many
rules and regulations remain on the books. Too many decisions
are still made by government bureaucracies, which remain
large and obstructive. And local bureaucrats -- who approve
big spending plans -- still have great power.
   Mr. Krejci's chemical factory is plagued by all of these
problems. It hasn't the money for a total overhaul. In
addition, it employs fewer workers than the coal mines
nearby, so local officials won't allow an investment that
could drastically reduce demand for local coal. And even as
the government moves to ease such bureaucratic restrictions,
the tendency of factory managers is to follow the old rules
and defer to higher, centralized authority.
   The last is the most daunting stumbling block. "Our
biggest challenge still is to convince the man in the street
of the necessity to adapt," says Jan Tauber, adviser to
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus. "The idea that the free-market
economy is a great opportunity for us hasn't been accepted by
the majority of people."
   The lack of acceptance is readily apparent in such towns
as Karlovy Vary, the county seat of a 120,000-population
district in Western Bohemia, near the German border. The town
used to be called Carlsbad, once famous as a spa that was
favored by Beethoven, Goethe and European royalty. But the
hotels and baths of the spa now are run-down and need
hundreds of millions of dollars in investment -- probably
foreign. And for the moment, foreign investors are moving
cautiously because of Czechoslovakia's uncertain economic
climate.
   High-quality glass and porcelain crafted here sell in such
pricey U.S. stores as Saks Fifth Avenue. But most people are
employed in industry, and the district is surrounded by strip
mines, power stations and factories that make it one of the
worst-polluted areas of Czechoslovakia. "Before the war, the
Czech living standard was as high as America's. Our cities
were beautiful. We made the fastest planes in the world,"
says Stan Kment, a Czechoslovak who left after World War II
and now lives in Canada. "Now, there's nothing. People are
poor. They got salaries for doing nothing, and they don't
know how to work. They don't know where to begin a capitalist
system."
   Right now the people of Karlovy Vary are caught in a kind
of limbo, in a transitional period between strict state
control of the economy and Western-style freedom, leaving
them with a feeling of uncertainty about the future. They
worry about unemployment; it was almost nonexistent under the
Communists, but there are fears it could skyrocket to 15% or
more once state subsidies are ended. Some even worry about
homelessness, which was unheard of under the old system. And
even before a free market takes effect, the people are
angered by prices, recently they have soared 50% for some
meat and vegetables.
   In the local grocery store, in downtown Karlovy Vary,
shoppers grumble in the poorly lit aisles. No fresh fruits or
vegetables are on display, and the best-selling item appears
to be still-inexpensive Chinese rice. Other products, such as
a can of Soviet mackerel whose price recently rose 65%, "were
probably unsellable even at the old price. Now it's
impossible," says Milos Vanecek, the store's manager. There
are thousands of these grocery stores across Czechoslovakia,
and they still belong to a state agency that supervises food
distribution. The higher prices aren't due to a free market.
The Havel government is stripping away certain subsidies that
supported food prices, and the authorities who fix prices
have been permitted to raise them somewhat to offset lost
subsidies. To help defray the higher costs, the government
gave everyone a one-time handout of 140 korunas -- about $6
at the official rate.
   Some people, like Blanka Boura, a junior-high-school
teacher, are getting increasingly restive. They don't see the
rationale for Czechoslovakia's economic upheaval, for the
uncertainty and lack of improvement in their own lives.
"People are fed up with the way things are," she says.
"Prices are going up, too high if you ask me. People didn't
expect it would take this long to get results. Most people
don't understand the point of all this."
   As they see the slow pace of progress, people here are
revising their expectations of how long it will take
Czechoslovakia to rejoin the Free World economic system.
Vaclav Tomandl, Karlovy  Vary's leading banker, says: "We are
still at the first mile of a 1,000-mile trip. Czechoslovakia
may make it, but it will take years, not months. Generations,
not years."
   Mr. Tomandl is director of the Komercni Banka, a new
commercial-banking venture established earlier this year to
help finance economic reform in Czechoslovak regions. "The
problem was and still is there is no dynamism in the
economy," he says.
   Mr. Tomandl and his wife, Dana, who works in a
government-owned construction firm, say that perhaps one
person out of 10 in Karlovy Vary is imbued with the new
entrepreneurial spirit. (Local figures show 2,500 registered
small-business people.)
   Over strong coffee in his office on Engles Boulevard, Mr.
Tomandl and his deputy, Pavel Woydich, complain about the
lack of reality among their customers. The bank, which was
spun off from Czechoslovakia's central bank under the
country's new laws, is the biggest source of investment
finance in town; it has lent eight million korunas ($333,000)
to 66 different entrepreneurs in the past six months. These
small-business people range from plumbers to electricians to
taxi drivers.
   But most people, such as the students who wanted a loan to
stage a rock opera, think the bank is a government agency to
distribute money, just as the government distributes salaries
and benefits. Says Mr. Woydich: "They come in here every
Monday, after a weekend of thinking, and they say, `Give us
some money.' They are surprised when we want to see how they
calculate their potential income. When we say `How do you
intend to pay us back?' they look at us as if we're crazy. No
one here knows about any of these things."
   The bankers concede that even they have sometimes been
flying blind when it comes to judging borrowers'
credit-worthiness and prospects for success. "It is hard to
value assets here, beause there is no market for many
things," says Mr. Tomandl. Accounting standards vary widely.
"As the euphoria vanishes and the reality sets in, what we
need most is experience," he adds. Though the bankers won't
say it, they don't quibble with estimates that up to half of
the new entrepreneurs may fail.
   Mr. Tomandl and his wife are the closest thing
Czechoslovakia has to yuppies these days. They drive a shiny
Lada, a coveted Soviet car, and are finishing a house on the
outskirts of Karlovy Vary, a Swiss-chalet-style home that
could house two families -- themselves and an
income-producing tenant.
   The story of their house, which has taken more than a year
to build, shows how hard it remains to get things done in
Czechoslovakia. Though the construction business is one of
the prime areas where entrepreneurs are starting, many
building materials are still centrally produced and
distributed. That means they are difficult to obtain.
Meantime, the customer, not the contractor, is responsible
for ensuring that bricks, mortar and even scaffolding are on
site as needed.
   In Mr. Tomandl's case, that has meant months of bickering,
negotiating and arm-twisting to get his job accomplished.
Others, though not Mr. Tomandl, cut corners through bribery.
"Don't talk to me about the house. It's been a nightmare,"
says Mr. Tomandl.
   The situation isn't much easier for the entrepreneurs
themselves. Though the government is trying to cut the
bureaucracy, starting your own business in Czechoslovakia
remains an odyssey requiring dozens of official stamps and
monthlong waits for permits.
   "It's incredibly difficult," says Stanislav Slama, who is
Karlovy Vary's first entrepreneur -- a three-year veteran of
private enterprise. Mr. Slama repairs cars, specializing in
the Trabant, the East German car that arguably got revolution
in the East Bloc rolling by carrying East Germans across
Warsaw Pact borders last year.
   Before he could start his business, Mr. Slama had to get
written permission from the state-run car-repair shops in
town -- with which he was about to compete. Even now, he gets
verbal abuse from some former colleagues at the state repair
shop where he worked for 25 years, and some people park their
cars to block customers from his workshop.
   "I never could do this {go into private business} if I
hadn't been working for a state company for 25 years. My
contacts are the only reason I can find spare parts," he
says. Even so, he doesn't always succeed.
   For instance, after waiting a year to buy a car jack from
the single factory in Czechoslovakia that makes the item, Mr.
Slama is abandoning hope. He now plans to go across the
border into West Germany, where, he says, every auto-parts
store stocks the item and probably sells it at lower cost.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Slama's venture has been a success; his
repair shop is crowded with half a dozen cars to repair, and
he works weekends to keep up with the business. This year he
is earning three times his previous salary, but even so he
isn't sure how much he will keep. That's because of
uncertainty about taxes. Although the government is trying to
encourage entrepreneurs, its tax policy remains confusing and
changeable, so these business people can't be sure that
working longer hours will increase their income.
   Above all, entrepreneurs fear that lingering public
attitudes from the Communist era may continue to make life
difficult for them, even in an era of sweeping change. At the
six-month-old Association of Entrepreneurs, whose office is
in the former Communist Party headquarters deputy director
Ivan Zikes says: "We are fighting a deformation of the human
mind. During 40 years of the totalitarian regime, people have
formed the opinion that all private businessmen are thieves
trying to get money without doing any work."
   In Karlovy Vary's baroque town hall, Mayor Jiri Kovarik
says such attitudes and regulations "are hampering our
entrepreneurs from developing their activities fully." What
the town needs most, Mr. Kovarik says, is "money, management
and to change the thinking of people." The last item will
take the most time.
   "You come into a restaurant," Mr. Kovarik says. "The
person attending you isn't trying to make it agreeable. He
never smiles, he gives no advice. He just wants the customers
to leave as soon as possible. Maybe 95% of the people are
still thinking this way. It will require a generation to
change this attitude."
   In the meantime, the mayor adds, "we will have problems of
disintegration. If a dog tied to a leash for a long time is
suddenly released, the first thing it does is run around with
no logic. Only after this phase of freedom is gotten used to,
does it begin acting logically."
   "Our problem," says the mayor, "is more in the head than
in the wallet."
