   NEW YORK -- The Home Savings Bank, whose shareholders just
approved the bank's acquisition by H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., said
it will suspend payment of the third-quarter dividend.
   Robert Pondt, Home Savings' senior executive vice
president, said the board of directors voted to suspend the
18.75-cent-a-share payout in the hope of saving about $2
million by the end of the year. The quarterly dividend was
last paid on July 19.

   Mr. Pondt said the suspension of the payout wasn't at
Ahmanson's request, but he added that it could enhance Home
Savings' value to Ahmanson. He also said payment of a
fourth-quarter dividend depends on earnings reported for the
current quarter and completion of the acquisition, which is
expected by year end. However, he said the bank expects flat
third-quarter earnings.
   The acquisition, valued at about $300 million, was
approved Wednesday by Home Savings' shareholders, and is
subject to regulatory approval.
   Home Savings, with assets of $1.5 billion, operates 13
full-service banking offices in the New York metropolitan
area.
   H. F. Ahmanson of Irwindale, Calif., with more than $47.6
billion in assets, is the parent company of Home Savings of
America and The Bowery Savings Bank.
