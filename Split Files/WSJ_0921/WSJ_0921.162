   Ogden Corp. ended speculation that it might split into two
public companies, and said it intends to retain its 85%
holding in Ogden Projects Inc., its waste-to-energy unit.
   Odgen, based in New York, also announced a major
reshuffling of the Ogden Projects board, replacing five of
its eight members and adding three others.

   Earlier this year, Ogden had been discussing the possible
creation of Ogden Projects as a separate entity.
   Ogden Projects, which went public in 1989, has been
growing rapidly as it brings on line large waste-to-energy
plants operating long-term contracts; at the end of 1989, it
had 13 plants in operation, 7 under construction, and 6
awaiting license.
   Ogden's other major activity is a broad array of service
business which generated $1 billion of revenue in 1989,
ranging from asbestos abatement, managing arenas and
convention centers, and operating commercial aviation
facilities to managing industrial and building locations and
providing building maintenance services.
   For the six months, Ogden Projects had net income of $15.9
million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $189 million.
