   Southern National Corp. and NBSC Corp. said they agreed to
merge through an exchange of common stock valued at $53
million.
   The two banking companies said a formal merger agreement
will be negotiated in the next several weeks. The companies
said the number of shares of Southern National stock to be
exchanged will vary from 4.8 million to 5.3 million,
depending on the price of Southern National stock at the time
the exchange ratio is set.

   The merger is subject to negotiation of a definitive
agreement and approval by federal regulators and shareholders
of both corporations.
   The principal subsidiary of NBSC is the National Bank of
South Carolina. That bank will become part of Southern
National Bank of South Carolina, a subsidiary of Southern
National.
   The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the
second quarter of 1991, will make Southern National of
Lumberton, N.C., the fifth-largest bank-holding company in
North Carolina with $4 billion in assets, while doubling its
market share in South Carolina.
   NBSC is based in Sumter, S.C.
