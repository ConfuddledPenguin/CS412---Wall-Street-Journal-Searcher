   NEW YORK -- The dollar gained slightly against most major
currencies, reflecting technical buying, fears about the
heightening of Middle East tensions, and hopes that the
Federal Reserve will postpone cutting U.S. interest rates.
   With the start of Rosh Hashana, or the Jewish New Year, a
national holiday Monday in Japan and a meeting of the Group
of Seven industrialized nations Saturday, the market traded
as if yesterday were the end of the week.

   "This has been a rather tricky market to keep up to speed
on," said Keith Cheveralls, New York foreign-exchange manager
for Nippon Credit Bank. Ahead is a "big weekend," he said,
both in duration because of the holidays and in importance
because of the G-7 conference in Washington.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5773 marks and 1.3205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5715 marks
and 1.3094 francs late Wednesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 137.65 yen, rising from
137.52 yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
137.75 yen, up from 137.05 yen at the close there Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5773
marks, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5733 marks.
   On Thursday, the dollar rose as high as 1.5835 marks and
1.3270 francs and fell as low as 136.40 yen. Its movements
reflected, in part, cross trading between the yen and
European currencies.
   Asian dealers began a trend that lasted almost to the
close of the North American session, of buying yen and
selling European currencies to cover short, or oversold, yen
positions. As a result of its role as a medium in such cross
trades, the dollar was much higher against the European
currencies but lower against the yen for most of the global
trading day.
   Those differences narrowed when the yen's rise reversed in
a burst of activity about two hours before the close of New
York trading.
   Dealers couldn't pin down a fundamental reason for the
sudden turnaround in the cross market. But they said a rally
in oil prices at about that time may have served as an excuse
to unload yen. Japan imports almost all of its crude and is
considered vulnerable to rising oil prices.
   Meanwhile, independent dollar buying was encouraged by a
green light from technical charts, a jeep accident in Saudi
Arabia and continued optimism about the postponement of U.S.
rate cuts after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
congressional testimony Wednesday.
   Ian Foakes, PaineWebber's foreign-exchange manager, said a
technical indicator signaled a dollar-buying opportunity
early yesterday, in response to the greenback's recent gains.
The indicator gauges how well a currency sticks to highs it
sets, and the U.S. currency looked good yesterday after its
advances Wednesday.
   "The dollar is fairly well underpinned," Mr. Foakes said.
"It looks better than the last time it was up here" last
week.
   After drifting lower in early European trading, the dollar
bounced higher on news that a U.S. soldier was killed and two
others injured in a jeep accident in Saudi Arabia. The
incident created a belief that tension might escalate in the
Mideast, and that the dollar might serve as a "haven"
currency for investors in case of war.
   "Of course, this {incident} won't trigger a war, but the
market was already short" dollars and primed to move higher,
said Rainer Marian, analyst at Hessische Landesbank in
Frankfurt.
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly higher, helped
against sterling, the mark and the Swiss franc by cross
movements into the yen and expectations that U.S. interest
rates aren't about to ease just yet. In Mr. Greenspan's
congressional testimony Wednesday, the Fed chairman had
expressed concern about the dollar's recent losses. The
dollar climbed as traders interpreted those comments as a
sign that the Fed won't cut interest rates soon. In general,
higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to
investors.
   The dollar finished Asian trading mixed Thursday. It
dropped against the yen, closing in Tokyo at 137.05 yen, a
full yen below its 138.05 yen Wednesday close.
   Tokyo traders attributed some of the yen's gains to
unwinding of short yen positions before Japan's holiday
weekend.
   Meanwhile, sterling was trading late in New York at
$1.8740, down from $1.8845 late Wednesday. However, the pace
of the pound's retreat slowed after a sharp fall Wednesday,
when Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl cast a cloud over
sterling's prospects for full membership in the European
Monetary System.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $389.10 an ounce, up $3.10. Estimated
volume was a light 2.1 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$389.90 an ounce.
