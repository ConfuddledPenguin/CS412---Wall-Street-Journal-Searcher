   SAN FRANCISCO -- An investment firm here said that it made
a $34.4 million bid to acquire Computer Factory Inc., a
nationwide computer retailer based in Elmsford, N.Y.
   Computer Factory is one of a number of computer retail
chains hit hard by price competition and overexpansion. Last
year, the chain opened stores in major cities around the
country, trumpeting low prices, but this year it has suffered
losses and curtailed expansion plans.

   Bay Street Group, a two-year-old merchant banking firm,
made a $4 a share offer in a Sept. 7 letter to Computer
Factory's board. It has received no response from the
retailer's management, Philip J. Gioia, Bay Street Group's
managing director, said.
   Mr. Gioia characterized the bid as "very friendly." In
trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Computer
Factory closed at $3.125, up $1.
   Computer Factory executives weren't available for comment
yesterday because of the religious holiday. The company sells
and services personal computers through its retail stores,
and earned $3.1 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of
$369 million in 1989.
