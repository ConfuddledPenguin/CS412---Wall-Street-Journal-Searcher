   Interpublic Group of Cos., which currently holds 35.4% of
Lowe Group PLC, said yesterday it plans to acquire the
remaining 64.6% of the British agency group in a transaction
valued at approximately $160 million.
   The transaction would give Interpublic full ownership of a
third international ad network. Lowe, a fast-growing firm
with offices in more than 10 countries including the Lowe &amp;
Partners agency in New York, would join Interpublic's two
major advertising networks, McCann-Erickson and Lintas.

   As part of the deal, Lowe shareholders will be offered a
choice of cash or Interpublic stock. New York-based
Interpublic said it will offer #4.25 ($8) in cash for each
Lowe share or, alternatively, seven Interpublic shares for
every 25 Lowe shares. That ratio works out to 0.28
Interpublic share for each Lowe share. There are 19.5 million
Lowe shares affected by the offer.
   The stock offer values the Lowe shares slightly higher
than the cash offer, and Interpublic officials are clearly
hoping that the majority of holders will opt for the stock
swap. Interpublic shares fell 50 cents yesterday to close at
$30.125 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Analysts said Interpublic is snagging Lowe at a bargain
price. Lowe's stock, amid a dismal U.K. advertising
environment, has taken a beating on the London stock exchange
recently. Industry executives said Interpublic wouldn't have
been able to afford the company just six weeks ago, when Lowe
stock was trading at around 430 pence a share. Yesterday,
shares of Lowe soared 55% to trade at 410 pence, up 145 pence
from Wednesday's late price of 265 pence.
   Interpublic said it decided to buy the rest of Lowe Group
to further strengthen its position in Europe and to offer a
third independent ad network to prospective clients. While
the McCann and Lintas agencies are known for solid, if
unexciting, ads for clients like Coca-Cola and Unilever, Lowe
Group, which is headed by Frank Lowe, has gained notice for
its offbeat, spunky, creative work.
   "Each of the Interpublic agencies have different
philosophical approaches to the business," said Philip H.
Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
Interpublic. "Looking at the competitive situation in the
marketplace, this provides prospects with three different
options." In turn, Interpublic will be able to increase its
market share, he said.
   Analysts cheered the move, saying Interpublic is picking
up a profitable agency that will help boost its own
prospects. "I think it's a very good deal," said Jim
Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest Securities USA.
"Lowe's net income is growing a lot faster than Interpublic's
is. This is certainly going to be a plus to Interpublic's
growth rate."
   Said Karen Ficker, an analyst at Labe Simpson in New York,
"It adds some flair to the agency network. They've picked up
an additional piece of the agency puzzle with no conflicts at
a relatively low price."
   The analysts also noted that the transaction would give a
handsome boost to billings at Interpublic, which hasn't been
immune to the downturn in the U.S. ad business. Advertisers,
wary of the shaky economy, have in many cases drastically cut
their advertising budgets, and the ad-spending outlook is
uncertain. Major ad concerns like Interpublic have reported
decreasing revenue from U.S. operations. Lowe's billings at
the end of 1989 were #858 million.
   Interpublic has for several years had various financial
relationships with Lowe agencies. Last year, it exchanged its
stake in the Lowe Marschalk agency, now known as Lowe &amp;
Partners, for a larger stake in Lowe Group.
   Interpublic said it believes around 30% to 40% of Lowe's
shareholders will opt for Interpublic stock, with the
remaining shareholders taking cash. It said Lowe employees,
officers and directors -- who together control about 10% of
the stock outstanding -- all plan to take the Interpublic
stock option. The acquisition, which is subject to certain
regulatory conditions, is expected to be completed by year
end.
   Mr. Lowe, a charismatic British adman, will be invited to
join the Interpublic board, the company said.
   Eugene P. Beard, executive vice president of finance and
operations at Interpublic, said, "We're paying 10 times
projected earnings on estimated 1990 {Lowe Group} earnings.
For an agency like Lowe and the talent of Frank and his
people, I think it's a very fair deal for everybody."

   Saatchi Wins Holly Farms
                                                                                                       

   Tyson Foods pulled its $15 million Holly Farms chicken
account from Long, Haymes &amp; Carr, Winston-Salem, N.C., and
awarded it to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, New York.
   Tyson acquired Holly Farms last year following a long
takeover fight. Saatchi, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.,
creates ads for Tyson's other fresh and processed chicken
lines, an account that also bills about $15 million. The
agency created Tyson's "Feeding You Like Family" campaign.
   Jack Dunn, vice president of retail marketing at Tyson,
said the company moved the business to consolidate its
chicken advertising at one agency.
   "Basically, it boils down to getting as few cooks in the
kitchen as we possibly can," Mr. Dunn said. "Saatchi had the
inside track and was doing good work for us." He said the
account was moved without a review.

assignments for Continental Baking, a Ralston unit.

were promoted to executive vice president in the shop's media
department. Marc Goldstein was elected executive vice
president, director of national broadcast media and
programming; Carolyn Libby was named executive vice
president, executive media director of Lintas:New York; and
Paul Hunt and Bob Gervason will assume similar positions at
Lintas:Campbell-Ewald in Detroit.
