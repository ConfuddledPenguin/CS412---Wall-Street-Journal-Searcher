   SINGAPORE -- MasterCard International took the first step
in decentralizing its management, marketing and
member-support services when it opened its first regional
headquarters in Singapore.
   The Asia-Pacific office will oversee Hong Kong, Sydney and
Singapore -- and two representative offices -- Beijing and
New Delhi.

   James A. Cassin, president of MasterCard's Asia/Pacific
operations, said the office will be the prototype by which
subsequent regional headquarters will model themselves.
   Between four to six more regional offices are expected to
be opened by the end of 1992. These will be for the U.S.,
Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and
Canada.
   The New York office will then become an umbrella for the
overall coordination of each region, being responsible for
the broader policy decisions of the company.
