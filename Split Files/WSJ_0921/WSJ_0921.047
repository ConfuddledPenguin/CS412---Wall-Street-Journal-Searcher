   NEW YORK -- Scholastic Corp., which for generations has
catered to children's reading needs, plans a stock offering
for an older crowd.
   Late this month, the company plans to offer 4.2 million
common shares, including 800,000 to be sold outside the U.S.
The issue is expected to be priced between $18 and $21 a
share, as noted in the preliminary prospectus.

   The issue will have to weather a significantly weakened
initial public offering sector. IPO issuance has slowed
sharply, echoing the broad stock market drop in response to
the Persian Gulf crisis and its potential ramifications for
economic growth and inflation.
   The IPO "sector of the market is on the speculative fringe
to begin with," says Al Hadhazy, senior research analyst at
the "New Issues" newsletter. Overall market uncertainty has
an "especially dramatic" impact on IPOs, he adds.
   Scholastic, which distributes as well as publishes books,
magazines and educational materials, was taken private in
July 1987 by chairman Richard Robinson, a son of founder
Maurice R. Robinson, other members of the Robinson family,
management and certain other investors. If the offer comes in
the expected price range, existing holders stand to see a
hefty increase in the paper value of their shares, which were
purchased at an average $1.35 each.
   Of the 4.2 million common shares to be sold, 3.27 million
will be sold by the company and the rest by holders. While
owners of the common stock will have the right to elect
one-fifth of the board, the voting power of the company's
capital stock is vested in holders of Class A stock.
   The prospectus notes: "Richard Robinson and two trusts
controlled by members of the Robinson family {including
Richard Robinson} own approximately 95% of the outstanding
Class A stock, and, pursuant to stock options, Richard
Robinson alone has the ability to obtain in excess of 50% of
the Class A stock."
   In the year ended May 31, Scholastic had operating profit
of $24.3 million, up nearly 69% from $14.4 million in fiscal
1989. Revenue grew 25% to $374.6 million from $299.6 million
in fiscal 1989. In fiscal 1988 the company had a $6.7 million
operating loss on revenue of $246.1 million.
   Revenue has more than doubled from $180.3 million in
fiscal 1986, largely due to the growth of Scholastic's
children's book publishing business.
