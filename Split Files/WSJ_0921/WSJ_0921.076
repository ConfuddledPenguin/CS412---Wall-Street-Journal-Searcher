   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission, trying to
reconcile mergers and acquisitions in the EC's airline
industry with its own aims to deregulate the sector after
1993, next week will consider a policy paper outlining how EC
competition rules should be applied to the fast-changing
industry.
   The nonbinding paper, which is scheduled to go to the 17
commissioners Sept. 26, was drawn up jointly by the
commission's transport and competition directorates. The two
departments often are at odds on air-transport questions, as
are their bosses, Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert and
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner. Thus, EC
insiders familiar with the paper say, the document is a
series of compromises.

   The issues themselves are complex and beg a philosophical
point: Should the EC allow its airlines to gobble one another
up in the hopes that the survivors can better compete with
U.S. and Asian "megacarriers"? Or should it insist that
deregulation be enacted in such a way that there is lively
airline competition within the EC, possibly to the detriment
of big, high-cost carriers?
   A draft of the paper doesn't supply any easy answers. Nor
does it shed much light on how the commission might rule on
various airline acquisitions and partnerships already being
investigated by antitrust officials.
   Among the more important cases are: Air France's purchase
of controlling stakes in two other French carriers, Union de
Transports Aeriens and Air Inter; the acquisition of 40% of
Sabena World Airlines by British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines; a wide-ranging cooperation agreement between Air
France and Lufthansa; and British Airway's complaint over
Lufthansa's plans to acquire 26% of East German carrier
Interflug.
   In the run-up to the more free-wheeling skies of 1993, EC
airlines have been busy forging cross-border alliances.
Against this backdrop, the paper says, the EC should accept
that more partnerships, acquisitions and even mergers will
occur in the industry. But the EC doesn't want a
concentrated, inefficient, high-cost airline oligopoly to
develop. Nor does it want a fragmented airline industry
lacking competitiveness on a world-wide scale.
   In the search for middle ground, the paper offers
something for everyone. "The basic task is to reconcile the
benefits of a sufficient degree of internal (EC) competition
in relation to fares and quality of services with the
necessity (for airlines) to develop toward globally
competitive sizes," it says.
   It says, for example, that state aid could be given to
smaller, weaker EC airlines so they could restructure
themselves and avoid being bought by a larger competitor. It
suggests that money-losing "public service" air routes could
receive subsidies in an EC-wide tender system. The paper
ventures that small or struggling carriers are most likely to
benefit from associating with other airlines, and that such
partnerships could be pro-competition.
   For liberals who want full-blown EC airline deregulation,
the paper offers some hope. "Experience in the U.S. shows
that an active merger policy is absolutely required" to
safeguard consumer choice, low fares and good service. "The
commission's application of competition law must aim at
maintaining competition," the document says. "This will
require thorough scrutiny of airline reorganizations leading
to airport dominance, creating undue market power in
substantial sales areas or limiting consumer choice on
significant routes."
   Special concern may be warranted when one airline combine
controls more than 25% of a relevant market, sales area or
route network, the paper says. In some cases, dominant
airlines could be forced to relinquish certain route licenses
or landing slots to other airlines to ensure that there is
competition.
   Interestingly, the paper disputes airlines' assertions
that they must be big to be competitive. "A well-integrated,
small (route) network may yield much higher (aircraft)
utilization rates and consequently lower seat-mile costs than
a larger, uncoordinated network," says the paper. "These
economies . . . relate only very loosely to the size of the
company and . . . are not relevant to the assessments of the
benefits of being a megacarrier."
   Moreover, the room for economies of scale sought by
airlines in buying or teaming up with their competitors
exists only in limited ways compared with total costs. And
many of the benefits can be achieved in specific
collaborations rather than from buying the competition, the
paper says. Often when airlines grow larger, they incur more
inefficiencies and higher overheads, negating the desired
effects.
   Finally, the economies of scope that airlines talk about
finding when they combine activities previously done by
separate companies mainly result in increasing airline
revenue, not in holding down costs. The market strength
inherent in dominating an airport, controlling a computer
reservations system, exercising price leadership or
introducing frequent-flier programs can, in fact, diminish
competition and increase costs and fares, the paper says.
   "There is evidence that competition is only really
effective once a route is operated by three or four air
carriers," it says. "The opening of access to the market is
particularly important."
