   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 524 money market
funds rose $1.72 billion to $408.76 billion in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 256 general-purpose funds rose $1.05 billion to
$144.85 billion, and assets of 105 broker-dealer funds rose
$40.9 million to $165.61 billion. Assets of 163 institutional
funds rose $629.5 million to $98.30 billion.

   Despite light trading with narrowly fluctuating money
market fund yields and short-term interest rates, "assets of
money market funds rose nonetheless by a substantial amount,
reflecting investors' basic predilection for safety in times
of economic uncertainty," said Jacob Dreyer, chief economist
at the Institute.
   Fund assets were revised for the week ended Sept. 12, to
$407.04 billion. The increase reported for that week was
revised to $497.8 million.
