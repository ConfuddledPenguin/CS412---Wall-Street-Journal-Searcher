   GLOOM AT THE IMF MEETING

   For the countries already struggling with wrenching
reforms and economic contraction, the next several years
promise further hardship.
   This bleak prognosis stems from official forecasts and
comments from financial leaders on the eve of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. For
Eastern Europe and developing nations that rely on imported
oil, times will get worse before there is even a fragile hope
for improvement, IMF officials predicted.
   Western diplomats predicted increased pressures from
developed countries for special assistance. A pressing
question at the meeting will be possible aid programs for
Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, all of which are badly hit by the
trade embargo imposed on Iraq.
   Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said East
bloc nations and developing countries should "redouble
efforts" to tame inflation and adopt market disciplines, even
at the risk of increasing social dislocation.
                                                                                                       

   U.S.-PHILIPPINE TALKS
                                                                                                       

   As talks continued on the future of U.S. military bases in
the Philippines, Philippine negotiators said they want full
sovereignty and operational control over Clark Air Base, the
largest U.S. airfield in the country, "as soon as possible,"
the spokesman for the Philippine panel said. For its part,
the U.S. offered to reduce its troop strength in the
Philippines but expressed hope that it could maintain a
military presence "which both countries would judge
appropriate."
                                                                                                       

   GOING PLASTIC IN ALBANIA
                                                                                                       

   Shoppers in Albania can now pay with Eurocard and
MasterCard. Eurocard International said the cards are to be
accepted first at the airport and two hotels in the Albanian
capital of Tirana and at one hotel in Durres, the Balkan
nation's largest port. Card holders can draw cash against
their cards at 26 outlets of Albania's national bank.
                                                                                                       

   U.K. OPPOSES CASSETTE TAX
                                                                                                       

   A European Community idea, not yet a formal proposal, to
impose a tax on blank audio-cassette tapes was roundly
dismissed by the United Kingdom. The tax, already imposed in
several EC countries, would help recording artists who lose
revenues due to illegal copying of their recordings. But the
U.K.'s junior trade minister, John Redwood, said it would
punish people who buy tapes for legitimate purposes. He added
that most of the money would have to be sent to the U.S.,
where the majority of recording artists live.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING FUEL IN CUBA
                                                                                                       

   Cuba's state railway said it would combine four
long-distance passenger trains linking Havana with eastern
Cuba as part of nationwide measures to reduce fuel
consumption. Ferrocarriles de Cuba said two trains would
result from the change, one traveling to the country's second
largest city, Santiago de Cuba, 600 miles southeast of
Havana, and the other to Holguin and Guantanamo, also on the
eastern part of the island.
                                                                                                       

   DAMS AND TUNNELS FOR LESOTHO
                                                                                                       

   Lesotho's water-project authority has awarded a contract
worth about 3 billion French francs ($570 million) to a group
of three French companies and one Italian concern for the
construction of a network of tunnels and dams. The project
will allow the mountainous country to export water to
neighboring South Africa. Spie Batignolles S.A., a unit of
Schneider S.A., said it and Campenon Bernard S.A., owned by
Cie. Generale des Eaux, would undertake the tunneling work.
They will be assisted by Bouygues S.A. and Italy's Impregilio
S.p.A, a Fiat unit, on dam construction. The project is to be
funded by international-development banks.
                                                                                                       

   THE EC AND JAPANESE CARS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community's fragile consensus on
progressively opening the EC market to Japanese car makers
after 1992 seems to be unraveling because of renewed
opposition led by France.
   During talks over dinner in Rome this week, EC trade
ministers got into a heated argument about how strictly to
limit Japanese car sales in the community after 1992. The
French, Italian and Spanish ministers, who are trying to
prevent any massive influx of Japanese cars into their
protected markets after 1992, were alarmed when they heard EC
Commissioner Frans Andriessen telling them that he was close
to producing an accord.
   That accord would allow Japanese car makers to increase
market share progressively over time, but at a much slower
rate than if the market were simply opened as scheduled after
1992. The French, Italians and Spanish now maintain that the
Iraqi crisis and the threat of economic recession make it
even harder for them to open their markets.
   The latest squabble "might make it tougher" for Mr.
Andriessen to reach an agreement, as he had hoped, before the
conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
negotiations in December, said one European industry
official.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Two Belgians have launched "1992," a board game testing
players' ability to devise a European Community business
strategy as well as their knowledge of European culture and
history. . . . The Oriental in Bangkok was voted "The World's
Best Hotel" for the 10th year in a row in a poll of senior
bankers by the publication Institutional Investor.
