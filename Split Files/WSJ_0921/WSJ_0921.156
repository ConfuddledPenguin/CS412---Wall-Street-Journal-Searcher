   Amdura Corp. said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court had approved a
settlement agreement providing for the payment of unpaid
retiree medical claims incurred prior to July 31, 1990, and
for the establishment of an ongoing medical and life
insurance plan for retirees and their dependents. The
settlement covers about 2,000 former employees of the
independent hardware distributor and its subsidiaries, the
company said.
   Funding for the plan will come from retiree premium
payments and a retiree benefit fund in excess of $1 million
to be established by Amdura and its subsidiaries, the company
said.
