   An Ohio machine tool concern was seized Monday by federal
agents who are investigating its suspected ties to the Iraqi
government and its possible supply of machinery for Iraqi
armaments.
   The company, Matrix-Churchill Corp., is a unit of
Matrix-Churchill Ltd., of Britain. In turn, the British
concern is owned by Technology &amp; Development Group Ltd., a
subsidiary of Al-Arabj Trading, an Iraqi holding company,
according to Stephen Hartkop, assistant agent in charge of
the U.S. Customs office in Cleveland that conducted the raid.

   The 12-employee company, based in Solon, Ohio, near
Cleveland, was padlocked and its assets seized under the
presidential order that Iraqi firms' assets be frozen, said
Mr. Hartkop. The firm had about $2 million in its bank
accounts, he said.
   Mr. Hartkop said the Ohio arm of Matrix-Churchill for
years had been a machine tool concern and that several
machines were on display in its offices. However, he said
Matrix-Churchill also had been purchasing other types of
manufacturing companies and apparently was shipping
manufacturing equipment to Iraq.
   The Customs agent said the investigation would focus on
whether the Solon company illegally exported munitions or
controlled commodities or violated laws concerning trading
with Iraq. He declined to say whether assets of other Ohio
companies also had been seized.
   Yesterday, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that a
secretary at Matrix-Churchill denied involvement with the
Iraqi government. A lawyer at a Cleveland firm that has
represented Matrix-Churchill couldn't immediately be reached.
