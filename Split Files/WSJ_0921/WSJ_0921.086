   A year after scientists found the gene that causes cystic
fibrosis, two research teams have used the gene to repair
cells taken from CF patients.
   Researchers at the University of Michigan and the
University of Iowa "fixed" the cells in test-tube experiments
by replacing defective disease-causing genes with their
healthy versions. The experiments are being hailed as a
watershed in a nearly decade-long effort to conquer the
most-common lethal inherited disease in the U.S.

   Reports of the experiments, released today, come just a
week after government scientists undertook the first
gene-therapy test in a human, transferring a gene into a
four-year-old girl who had a rare genetic defect that made
her vulnerable to dangerous infections. While scientists said
they are several years away from duplicating the feat in
children with cystic fibrosis, the two new reports suggest
for the first time that gene therapy for CF is possible.
   Moreover, the reports add to a growing list of recent
studies hinting that gene-replacement therapies may some day
treat more-common diseases as well as the very rare ailments
it was once assumed they would target. In any case, the
experiments suggest several strategies for treating CF,
including the development of the first drugs to reverse the
disease's assault on its victims.
   "This was the first hurdle that had to be overcome in
developing gene therapy for CF patients," says Robert Beall,
executive vice president, medical affairs, for the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation. "There is now scientific proof that you
can treat CF cells with a normal gene and make {the cells}
healthy."
   About 30,000 Americans, mostly children and young adults,
have cystic fibrosis. The disease occurs when a child
inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each
parent. The defective genes cause severe, and potentially
deadly, respiratory and digestive problems.
   Until recently, scientists had no way of determining how
the defective genes caused so much physical havoc. Then, in
August 1989, scientists in Toronto and at the University of
Michigan, culminating six years of searching, discovered the
gene that, when mutated, causes the disease. Almost
immediately, several teams of researchers launched
independent and collaborative efforts to show that cells in
the lungs and pancreas, two of several organs in which the
defective gene resides, could be corrected by giving them
healthy versions of the gene.
   But the scientists hit several unexpected roadblocks, says
James Wilson, an assistant professor of internal medicine at
the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. "We
felt bogged down for a long time," Dr. Wilson says.
   The gene involved in CF is unusually large, and
researchers had trouble fitting it together. When they
finally did construct the gene, they were unable to produce
enough of it to conduct experiments. The scientists finally
realized the gene was toxic to bacteria they were using to
reproduce, or clone, the gene.
   Once they had enough gene material, the scientists
inserted the normal gene into deactivated viruses. The
scientists then "infected" cells extracted from CF patients
with the viruses. The viruses, while no longer able to cause
illness, still were able to insert the normal gene into the
diseased cells. Viruses are useful for gene-therapy
experiments because they naturally work by inserting their
own genetic material into target cells, much as a postman
drops off mail from house to house.
   In recent years, scientists had found that cells taken
from the lining of lungs, pancreases and intestines of CF
patients were unable to move chloride, a type of salt, back
and forth across cell membranes. The free flow of chloride
molecules is important for the cells' proper water balance.
The upsetting of the balance seemed to be what caused the
cells that line lung airways to clog with mucous.
   In addition, scientists found that in cells unaffected by
CF, the chloride molecules moved back and forth as if being
pumped through a kind of window in the membrane that
regularly opened and closed. The scientists speculate that
the normal gene is involved in opening this window and that
in CF cells this window is jammed shut.
   Thus, the scientists at Michigan and Iowa figured that by
inserting the normal gene into defective cells they could get
the passageway to work properly, and chloride trapped inside
the cells could escape. In their reports, the scientists said
cells infected by the viruses indeed did begin pumping out
chloride in amounts similar to that normally expelled by
healthy cells.
   "It is a very satisfying set of results because we now
have measurable scientific proof that the CF defect does
indeed involve the chloride channel and that we have within
our means a way to repair it," says Michael Welsh, a
researcher at Iowa who led one of the two scientific teams.
   A report by Dr. Welsh's research team is to appear in the
British journal Nature next week. But it was released in an
unusual move to coincide with todays's publication in the
journal Cell of a similar experiment carried out by
researchers led by Dr. Wilson of Michigan. Dr. Welsh and Dr.
Wilson are also investigators for the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, which helped fund both of the experiments.
   Cystic fibrosis researchers say much needs to be done
before the viruses can be used to replace defective CF genes
in humans. The affected cells don't quickly reproduce, thus
the gene-replacement therapy would have to be performed
often. Scientists also must figure out exactly how to
administer the viruses.
   Toward this end, several other teams of researchers are
racing to develop an animal model of cystic fibrosis so that
the gene transfers could be first tested on animals.
Scientists are trying to create the model by inserting the
defective CF gene into mouse embryos that would then develop
into mature mice capable of passing on the defect to their
offspring. But scientists have yet to pull off this feat.
   Elsewhere, researchers are using the latest test-tube
results to measure the effectiveness of drugs in opening and
closing the chloride channels. "We now know the channel can
be opened," says the CF Foundation's Dr. Beall. "A drug that
can mimic the gene would be a truly useful medicine."
