   Halt, oh wayfarer, and face left to this sepulcher, in
which are the bones of a good, merciful friend of the poor. I
beg you, traveler, do not inflict any damage unto this tomb.
Gaius Attilius Evodus, freedman of Serranus, pearl vendor on
the Holy Way, lies inside this monument. Farewell, Wayfarer.

   ROME -- The Appian Way, oldest and most beloved of all
Roman roads, endured its first 2,250 or so years pretty well.
   Of course, funerary monuments and villas lining it have
been pillaged for their statues and blocks since at least
medieval times. And in the 1700s, the famous road's paving
stones were hauled off and diced into cobblestones for
streets and piazzas in downtown Rome.
   But in recent years the Appian Way -- which runs 330 miles
from Rome to Brindisi on the heel of the Italian boot -- has
suffered its gravest assaults.
   Trucks, buses and cars barrel down the initial -- now
mostly asphalted -- stretches of the ancient highway, past
Quo Vadis Church, threatening fragile monuments and
two-millennia-old Christian and Jewish catacombs buried
alongside or beneath it. Rome's beltway slices through the
Appian Way -- the idea of a beltway underpass beneath the
ancient road never got off the blueprints or beyond political
bickering.
   Ciampino military airport looms nearby. Uncontrolled
development has put apartment buildings within eyeshot of the
road, which, in parts built slightly up on a lava flow, once
provided uninterrupted views of farmland dotted with flocks
of sheep.
   In 1984, the medieval Appian Tower collapsed from neglect.
Old toilets, mattresses, tires, dirt and rubble from
construction sites are dumped by the road beyond the beltway.
With only a handful of guards along the entire Appian Way,
almost all the sculpted marble intact at the time of World
War II has been plundered.
   Says Lorenzo Quilici, author of several books on the
Appian Way and a professor at the University of Rome: "Stolen
are not just small decorative pieces, such as heads, statues,
boundary markers, altars -- but also columns, inscribed
stones, cornices, and friezes that, for their dimensions and
weight, certainly required the use of cranes and heavy-duty
vehicles."
   He adds: "Today there is less of a collective conscience
to respect our cultural patrimony. . . . Today everyone wants
a piece of marble in his villa."
   Prof. Quilici also says the boom in the art and
antiquities market has added to the desecrations.
   In the late 1970s, Italy's superintendent of archaeology
brought several of the remaining valuable pieces to the
National Museum of Rome, replacing them with copies cast in
cement.
   During the first half of the 1800s, popes and artists did
much to fix up the road, putting marble statues back into
their upright positions and raising brick panels to which
were attached sculpted fragments. In this way, the fragments
could be admired on the spot where they were found, instead
of being hauled off to a museum or a private collection.
   "Look how our culture has regressed," since the time of
those popes and of sculptor Antonio Canova, "who wished that
these very pieces of marble remain to be enjoyed where they
were found," says Prof. Quilici.
   Romans of all classes were buried along the first
stretches of the Appian Way, which then were outside the
capital -- Roman custom forbade burial within city walls.
Most Roman consular roads -- highways built by a consul, one
of two supreme government officials -- were dotted with
tombs. But the gracious funerary monuments of the first dozen
or so kilometers of the Appian Way -- the mausoleums, small
temples, altars, pyramids, tumuli, funerary columns, stelae
and exedrae -- earned the road the epithet "Regina Viarum,"
or queen of roads.
   The labyrinthine catacombs also were used by persecuted
Christians and Jews for religious services. Saints Peter and
Paul were believed to have been buried for a time in St.
Sebastian's Catacombs, which burrow under the Appian Way.
   Like all Roman roads, the Appian Way's first use was for
military conquest of non-Romans living in Italy. The road,
which was begun at the Circus Maximus, eventually extended
all the way to Brindisi. Construction was started in 312 B.C.
by censor Appius Claudius; once completed, it provided Rome
with a land-sea route to more advanced cultures in the
Eastern Mediterranean area. Average travel time on foot: two
weeks.
   Beyond Rome, the road now is drivable or walkable only in
parts, though sections of it have been in continuous use.
Roman bridges, viaducts and more tombs are found all along
the way, including what is reputed to be Cicero's tomb near
Formia.
   After World War II, villas were built close to the Appian
Way, often heedless of ruins, and sold or rented to people in
the film industry, politicians, diplomats and other
well-heeled types. But today building along or near the road
is forbidden.
   But beyond the ban on building along the road, little else
has been done. Critics say that in the end, city, regional
and state administrators are to be blamed for not taking more
action.
   A plan by the Public Works Ministry to make the
monumental, initial 14-kilometer stretch of the Appian Way
and lands flanking it a 2,500-hectare (6,200-acre) national
archaeological park was signed into law in 1965. Such a park
was first proposed in 1809. But political friendships between
city administrators and private landowners have prevented
lands from being expropriated and the plan implemented, Prof.
Quilici and others say. To this day only 5% of the properties
have been expropriated.
   Anna Maria Ramieri, a spokeswoman in the office of the
Rome counselor for culture, says the accusations are
"suppositions" with "no proof." But "it's clear that
{landowners} put pressure on the politicians," she says.
"Otherwise, why would {the deadlock} continue?"
   Another law was passed in 1988 -- this time by the Lazio
region, which surrounds Rome. The law provides the framework
for a consortium among Lazio and the cities of Rome, Ciampino
and Marino -- all bisected by the Appian Way. Once delegates
are named, the consortium should draw up details for
expropriation of the most important properties, says Luciana
Vagnoni of the office of the regional counselor for town
planning. Her hope is that once formed, the consortium will
attract money from the European Community and the Italian
state, whose aid led, for example, to the purchase of private
properties in what are now the Roman Forum and Trajan's
Forum.
   But here, too, Mrs. Ramieri and others say administrators
aren't fundamentally interested in saving the Appian Way.
   Critics add that the Appian Way is just a better-known
example of decay and neglect in many of the cultural
artifacts of Italy. They note that, in a country rich in art,
the annual budget for the Cultural Properties Ministry is
only two-tenths of 1% of total government spending.
   A scintilla of hope lies in the example of another
consular road, the Flaminian Way, which once ran north from
Rome to Rimini. In a decade, segments of this road close to
downtown Rome and some archaeological sites along the way,
including Livia's villa, have been reclaimed or rescued from
abandon.
   In archaeological importance, the Flaminian Way is but a
side street to the Appian Way. Still, observers regard it as
a model of what can be done.
   "Being present at the site every day and in touch with it
are important," says Gaetano Messineo of the state
archaeology superintendence for Rome and instigator of the
project. Sitting in his office in a building believed to have
been a fourth-century arch commemorating Constantine's
victory over Maxentius, Mr. Messineo says his efforts on
behalf of the road almost cost him his job because of
political cross-fire and infighting.
   He adds: "Crucial to the Flaminian project's success was a
will to carry it through."
