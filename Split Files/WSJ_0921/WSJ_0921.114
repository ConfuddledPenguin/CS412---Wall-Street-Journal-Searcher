   LONDON -- The British government ordered antitrust probes
of two separate transactions planned by France's Thomson CSF
S.A. and Finland's Kemira Oy.
   The action holds up, at least temporarily, plans by
France-owned Thomson and British Aerospace PLC to merge their
guided-missile businesses. The merger, for which planning
began last year, would create one of the world's largest
missile makers, with annual sales of about #1.4 billion
($2.63 billion).

   The government also ordered an investigation into plans
for Kemira, a Finland-owned chemical company, to buy the
British nitrogenous fertilizer business of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC. The transaction, announced in July and valued
at less than #100 million, would make Kemira the largest
fertilizer supplier in Britain.
   The decision highlights how serious the ruling
Conservative Party is taking its recent vow to scrutinize
mergers involving foreign state-controlled companies.
