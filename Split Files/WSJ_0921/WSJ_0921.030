   SURGUT, U.S.S.R. -- When the Kremlin approved plans in
December 1988 to build five huge petrochemical plants in
Siberia with Western help, officials touted the project as a
showpiece of perestroika.
   The scheme was a blockbuster, with one estimate putting
total investment at $70 billion. The plants would turn huge
amounts of Siberian natural gas, currently wasted, into badly
needed plastics. And the Kremlin, hoping to show it was
serious about foreign investment, invited Western and
Japanese companies to build and run the plants through joint
ventures.

   But less than two years later, instead of five huge
complexes, only one is being built -- a relatively modest $2
billion extension of an existing plant. And its finances
haven't even been sorted out. Plans for the other complexes
have been shelved.
   Dozens of foreign companies, interested in the projects as
a way to break into the Soviet market, have left,
disillusioned. Rather than stimulating the ailing economy,
the plans have fueled an angry debate over government
industrial policy and the environment.
   "The idea of five plants was just gigantomania," says
Alexei Makarov, director of the Institute of Energy Research
at the Academy of Sciences. "The whole thing was very risky
and badly worked out."
   The fate of this "project of the century," as critics have
derisively dubbed it, marks the end of an era when the
Kremlin could ignore basic economics. For the first time,
government planners were forced to admit that a scheme of
this size is beyond their capabilities.
   Western officials say the petrochemical complexes also
illustrate the gulf that divides Soviet aims from those of
foreign partners. The Kremlin wants foreign firms to invest
large amounts in risky industrial projects, but most Western
companies look to much smaller plans that yield a more
certain payoff.
   "It's like ships passing in the night," says Mark S.
Vecchio of the U.S. law firm Coudert Brothers. "Conceptually,
joint ventures are almost doomed to failure because of the
differences in approach."
   Soviet officials have long been concerned with waste in
the Siberian oil fields, where a colossal 15 billion cubic
meters of gas is simply burned off every year. The flares
pollute the Siberian landscape. The petrochemical industry is
also in a sorry state; the Academy of Sciences says half the
machinery in Soviet refineries is obsolete or barely working.
   The petrochemical industry was thus deemed a priority area
when Mr. Gorbachev changed Kremlin policy toward foreign
investment by allowing joint ventures. In December 1988, the
government approved the five complexes. Dozens of prospective
partners, including Occidental Petroleum Corp., Italy's
Montedison S.p.A., and Japan's Mitsubishi Group, came to
Moscow for talks.
   Trouble began quickly. Four different government
ministries held separate negotiations without coordinating
their efforts, putting off several prospective Western
partners. The Kremlin's attitude to financing didn't help.
The scheme was far costlier than any of its past projects,
but the government refused to give credit guarantees. Joint
ventures should pay their own way, it argued. But the huge
investments would have to be financed by debt. And without
Soviet guarantees, the foreign companies argued, no
commercial bank would ever lend the money.
   Soviet organizations worried, too. More than a dozen
feasibility studies, undertaken by government agencies since
the initial Kremlin decision, describe an economy so
inefficient that it couldn't build two petrochemical
complexes in Siberia, let alone five. In May 1989, Gosplan,
the State Planning Committee, urged more study of the five
proposed plants.
   A month later, the Academy of Sciences put a $70 billion
price tag on the scheme and said the projects "significantly
exceed the real possibilities of the nation." The cost would
divert investment from the economy and risked raising foreign
debt to dangerous levels, its report said.
   In a letter to the newspaper Izvestia, 11 scientists
contended that the plants would wreck Siberia's environment,
turning it into "the garbage heap of the world."
   On the defensive, the government scaled back to just two
plants, in Tobolsk and Surgut. But, determined to go ahead,
last November it ordered work on the two to be speeded up.
   Two weeks later, Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S.
signed an agreement with a Soviet ministry to build the $2
billion Tobolsk plant inside an existing petrochemical
facility. The U.S. firm also continued negotiations on the
Surgut plant.
   But the Tobolsk signing ceremony was held up when one of
Combustion's key partners, McDermott International Inc.,
dropped out of the project. The Kremlin then got cold feet
about the financing and insisted on renegotiating the
contract. The venture was finally registered in May. But
Maxwell Asgari, who heads Combustion's Moscow office, says a
decision on financing Tobolsk won't be made until May 1991.
Until then, the two sides will use up their equity in the
venture.
   The Surgut complex is even more troublesome. A second
Gosplan report frets that Surgut can't handle such a big
project. It forecasts electricity shortages there by 1995
even without the new plant, and says roads, housing and
transport are all inadequate to support it.
   One of Gosplan's biggest worries is that inefficient
Soviet construction could severly hamper the plant's
profitability and raise the amount of hard currency debt
incurred. As it woefully pointed out, the original Soviet
plant in Tobolsk took 15 years to build and still isn't
ready.
   Gosplan was also unhappy about terms of the joint venture.
The Soviet side would do most of the work and incur most of
the debt, while the U.S. firm would just cash in on the
profits, it complained. "These conditions don't correspond to
the international principles of joint ventures," it said.
   Combustion Engineering's Mr. Asgari has heard such Soviet
arguments before. "They refuse to understand that in the
Soviet Union today, you aren't going to get any bank to
provide any money without a Soviet government guarantee," he
sighs.
   Environmental fears may now kill off Surgut for good. The
State Committee for Environmental Protection claims the plant
would severely damage the local environment, particularly the
river Ob. "It may be good for business but it's bad for the
environment," says Vladimir Goncharenko, one of Surgut's
activists, who already have held three rallies to protest the
project.
