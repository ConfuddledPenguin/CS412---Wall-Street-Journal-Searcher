   Concord Camera Corp., Avenel, N.J., said it defaulted on a
bank loan, citing poor results from retailing softness and
problems at its Hong Kong unit. The loan agreement allows the
bank to declare a default and seek remedies, but Concord said
it expects a waiver.
   For its fourth quarter ended June 30, Concord had a loss
of $2.4 million, or 57 cents a share, on revenue of $6.8
million. The annual loss was $3.2 million, or 77 cents a
share, on revenue of $28.4 million.

   Concord sells 35mm and 110 cartridge cameras that it makes
in China under its label and private labels. Concord said
that softness in the retail industry in the fiscal third and
fourth quarters hurt camera sales, and that "wrongful actions
by certain former officers and directors" of the Dialbright
Co. unit in Hong Kong resulted in manufacturing disruptions
and revaluation of certain inventories. Concord said that the
unit has been reorganized, and that legal proceedings have
begun in Hong Kong against the former employees.
