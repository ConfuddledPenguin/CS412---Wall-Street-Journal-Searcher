   IS BUSINESS OVERLOOKING the obvious?
   When new trade and investment opportunities are mentioned,
Europe is the world on everybody's lips, the talisman for
financiers and investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. And with
reason. The economic integration of the European Community
nations in 1992 and the opening of potentially rich new
markets in the East Bloc countries promise big profits for
those who position themselves early and well.

   But while businessmen and money men alike rivet their
attention on the Old World, a new economic colossus is slowly
and quietly taking shape in the new one. Call it Canamerico.
   With only modest attention being paid, Canada, the U.S.
and Mexico are gradually moving toward creation of a single
huge trade entity. Canada and the U.S. have already signed a
trade agreement that will wipe out tariff barriers and other
impediments; Mexico, which has cast aside its former
protectionism, now wants a similar pact. It will probably get
it.
   If Canamerico indeed comes into being, it would be a
powerhouse by almost any measure, exceedingly rich in natural
resources (particularly coal and natural gas), technology,
agricultural production, capital, and available labor. But
Canamerico is not reality yet, and the road to trade
unification is proving a hard one, full of potholes -- as
both Canada and Mexico are finding out.
                                                                                                       

   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico -- Better the devil you know than
the devil you don't know.
   The old saying applies well in Mexico today. It has a long
history of wariness toward its giant neighbor to the north,
the devil it knows so well, and for many years wrapped its
domestic industries in a cocoon of protectionism against
American and other foreign competitors. But over the past
four years it has been stripping away that protection,
exposing home industries to the cold winds of competition.
Now it wants to expose them even more by doing something it
had previously resisted -- entering into a free-trade
agreement with the U.S.
   Why? Because the devil Mexico doesn't know -- the ultimate
effect on it of operating without a trade pact -- looks even
more threatening now than Uncle Sam does. Mexico's leaders
are gambling that the risks to its own vulnerable industries
will be outweighed by major benefits, including further
pressure on companies to get lean, mean and competitive; the
opening of U.S. markets restricted now; and an infusion of
foreign capital.
   So, with a mixture of dread and anticipation, Mexican
business executives are bracing themselves for yet another
wave of fresh competition. One is Juan Manuel Martinez, who
is found here in Aguascalientes, a textile center 300 miles
northwest of Mexico City, stuffed inside an office no bigger
than a freight elevator.
   Mr. Martinez, 29, is co-owner of Distribuidora Deportiva,
a tiny athletic-clothes producer that is fitfully readying
itself for free trade with the U.S. He is sending his
seamstresses to a training center that local industrialists
just built near a cockfighting ring. He himself will enroll
in a new industry-sponsored program on clothing design at the
state university. His partner is in Chicago on a cut-rate air
ticket to check out the competition at an international
clothing expo. The partner (who has found an unattended WATS
line, thus saving the company a few pesos) calls to a pay
phone outside. Afterward, a visitor asks for the word from
the Windy City. "We are in for an enormous struggle," says
Mr. Martinez, slumping back in his chair.
   Mexican industry has suffered and struggled plenty
already, thanks to la apertura, the opening. This policy,
launched in 1986 by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then budget
minister and now president of Mexico, ended a period of
intense protectionism that had lasted since the end of World
War II.
   Under protectionism, the nation enjoyed three decades of
rapid growth that became known as the Mexican Miracle. But by
the '70s many industries had grown flabby, lazy and
uncompetitive, and the economy stagnated for a decade or
more. To get it moving, Budget Minister Salinas engineered
the reduction of Mexico's maximum tariff to 20% from 100% and
eliminated restrictive import licenses on 80% of the items
entering the country.
   The opening to foreign competition has succeeded in making
Mexican industry more competitive; manufactured exports have
risen to 65% of total exports today from 32% in 1985. But the
price has been extremely high -- the virtual collapse of
several Mexican industries hammered into the ground by
imported goods. Three-quarters of the country's toy factories
have closed, and employment in that industry has fallen by
50%. The shoe industry now operates at 60% of previous
capacity. The leading trade group of Mexican food producers
has lost 20% of its members.
   When he took office in December 1988 with the weakest
mandate of any modern Mexican president, Mr. Salinas was
faced with the very real prospect that his ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) would lose its
60-year grip on Mexico if he didn't do more to get the
country growing again. Mr. Salinas initially counted on new
money from abroad to lead the recovery; under another
manifestation of la apertura, Mexico changed its once highly
nationalistic foreign-investment laws and waited.
   But not much has happened. Some multinationals don't think
revisions in the law went far enough. In other cases, rising
protectionism in the big U.S. market, the main target, forced
foreign firms to scuttle planned joint ventures with Mexican
ones. And still other capitalists were diverted from Mexico
by perceived new opportunities in the newly liberalized
economies of Eastern Europe.
   President Salinas now believes that a trade pact with the
U.S. would do away with many of the impediments that have
made la apertura less than a complete success. "Up to now,"
he says, "Mexico has paid all of the costs of the opening and
hasn't obtained the benefits that it should."
   A formal trade agreement, he reasons, would change that in
a hurry. It would put an end to the protectionist moves of
U.S. industries that have hamstrung Mexican exporters of
cement, steel, textiles and farm products. And he is certain
that the guaranteed open access to the U.S. market would
provide "an enormous stimulus" to foreign investors who
couldn't count on it before.
   Even though business bankruptcies will almost inevitably
increase with free trade, Mexican businessmen are widely in
favor of it. A poll by the business magazine Expansion found
that 72% of executives wanted an agreement with the U.S.
"It's like everything else," says the head of one clothing
producer in Aguascalientes. "There will probably be more
losers than winners, but nobody thinks that his company will
be among the losers."
   That's assuming the U.S. textile and clothing industry,
which enjoys 20% tariffs and tight import quotas, is forced
to give them up -- something it won't do without a bitter
struggle. "What's at stake in this industry are two million
U.S. jobs at $7 an hour that could go to Mexico for $7 a
day," says an official of the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute.
   If free trade in this sector does come as expected, the
major Mexican producers stand to gain the most. "We see
opportunities to increase exports, maybe by 100%," says Pablo
Lozano Lopez, finance director of a unit of Grupo Textil San
Marcos S.A., whose factories sprawl over more than five acres
of Aguascalientes. When San Marcos got into towels not long
ago, it had the resources to send two dozen line workers to
Europe for training.
   "Not everyone will be in a position to exploit the coming
opportunities," says Carlos Ramirez, San Marcos's director of
sales. But galvanized by the potential opening of the U.S.
market, a lot of companies of all sizes in Aguascalientes are
getting ready to try.
   Creaciones Heidi S.A., a producer of children's clothing
with 100 workers, greatly upgraded quality with la apertura
and began exporting dresses through a trading company formed
by three dozen firms. Now it is organizing line workers into
Japanese-style quality circles, looking for a foreign
partner, and cutting the number of clothing lines produced
from 50 to five.
   "We have to do fewer things and do them better," says Juan
Manuel Lopez, the director general. Though he knows its
risks, he favors free trade, saying: "Anything that makes
Mexicans work harder is healthy."
   But along with the potential new opportunities come new
fears. Mario Montanes, co-owner of Creaciones Jaime y Mario
S.A., a mid-sized producer of jeans, is standing outside his
plant, chain-smoking nervously. The clothing label that was
his factory's biggest customer has just gone bankrupt. Now
Mr. Montanes's factory itself must hustle its product to
dozens of small distributors.
   "In Aguascalientes I've seen five or six businesses go
under in just two months," he says. "I went to Guadalajara
and it was worse: About 15 businesses closed this summer. Now
free trade is coming. God knows what will happen."
