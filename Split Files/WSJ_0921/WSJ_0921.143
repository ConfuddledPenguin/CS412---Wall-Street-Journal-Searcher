   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. refused Aon Corp.'s request for a
meeting to discuss its $40-a-share, or $840 million, bid.
   In a letter to Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's chairman and chief
executive officer, Corroon's Chairman and Chief Executive
Richard Miller said "the board has unanimously rejected Aon's
demands for a meeting to discuss its proposal and for an
opportunity to conduct a due diligence examination of New
York-based insurer Corroon &amp; Black.

   After Aon's offer was rebuffed by Corroon's board late
Tuesday, the Chicago insurer said it would leave its all-cash
bid on the table. But Wednesday, Aon's Mr. Ryan reiterated
that he wouldn't pursue the offer if Corroon's board
continues to oppose it.
   Mr. Miller also reiterated that Corroon's board believes
its previously announced merger with international insurance
broker Willis Faber PLC of London "is in the best interests
of Corroon &amp; Black shareholders . . ."
   The Willis Faber merger is currently valued at
$31.38-a-share, or $643.3 million, based on yesterday's
closing price. In London trading yesterday, Willis Faber
shares closed at 214 pence, up 4 pence.
   When Willis Faber made its merger proposal to Corroon on
June 4, the offer was valued at $34.72 a share, or $712.3
million.
   Corroon shareholders are set to vote on the Willis Faber
merger next Friday.
   Corroon shares fell $1.125 to $30.875 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   In Chicago, Aon officials weren't immediately available
for comment late yesterday afternoon.
