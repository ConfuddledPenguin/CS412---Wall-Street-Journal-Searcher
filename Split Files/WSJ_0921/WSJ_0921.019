   Houston -- One of history's hottest literary rivalries
took place in Italy in the 18th century between playwrights
Carlo Goldoni and Carlo Gozzi. Both men agreed that commedia
dell'arte, the improvisational comic form that had
entertained Italy and the rest of Europe for 200 years, was
at a crossroads. Goldoni felt that in the future commedia
should be more realistic, with stock characters like
Pantalone and Harlequin behaving like real people rather than
stereotypes. Gozzi wanted commedia to go in the opposite
direction -- toward fantasy and theatricality, with more
emphasis than ever on masks and make-believe.
   On the face of it, Goldoni won the argument. Realism,
which reached its apogee in the plays of Ibsen, Strindberg
and Chekhov at the end of the 19th century, has dominated
most of the 20th. Seeing Gozzi's "The King Stag," however,
one wonders if Goldoni's triumph may not have been a Pyrrhic
victory. Realism is hard put to match the enchantment of the
production now at the Alley Theater here.

   Like many of Gozzi's plays, "The King Stag" is a fable.
Other Gozzi works, for example, have titles such as "The
Serpent Woman," "The Blue Monster," and "Zeim, King of the
Genies." Two of his best known plays later became operas:
Puccini's "Turandot" and Prokofiev's "The Love of Three
Oranges."
   "The King Stag" takes place in the Oriental kingdom of
Serendippo, where the handsome young monarch, King Deramo
(Thomas Derrah), having already interviewed 748 young women,
still has not found a wife. Tartaglia (Mark Zeisler), the
devious prime minister, wants his daughter Clarice (Ellen
Kohrman) to bag Deramo, but she is in love with Leandro (Ben
Evett), the son of Pantalone (Steven Skybell). Meanwhile,
Leandro's sister Angela (Bari Hochwald) loves the king, but
the evil Tartaglia is determined to keep this beauteous
damsel for himself.
   In the enchanted forest of Miracoli, Tartaglia sees his
chance to foil the king and win Angela. Deramo has learned an
incantation with which he can transfer his soul into the body
of a dead creature. When Tartaglia challenges him to
demonstrate his magical powers by sending his soul into the
corpse of a stag, the king says the magic words and makes it
happen, whereupon Tartaglia, repeating the king's sorcery,
implants his own spirit in the dead body of the king.
   Now, inhabiting the king's body, he returns to Serendippo
to pursue Angela. The king, in the body of the stag, has his
soul transferred once again to that of a frail old man who
has died. When he returns to his kingdom, Angela, realizing
that Deramo is now in the body of the old man, must come to
terms with accepting him in this form and rejecting
Tartaglia. (One is tempted to say: shades of "Prelude to a
Kiss," the current Broadway show in which a young woman's
soul inhabits an old man's body.)
   As is proper in a fairy tale, all ends happily with the
lovers restored and Tartaglia dead.
   The current production of "The King Stag" originated at
the American Repertory Theater (ART) in Cambridge, Mass., and
all of the performers are from the ART. The play has a witty,
eminently playable English text by Albert Bermel and was
directed by Andrei Serban. The true heroine of the evening,
however, is Julie Taymor, who not only created the
imaginative masks, paper animals and other creatures, but is
responsible for the choreography. The music is by Ms.
Taymor's longtime collaborator Elliot Goldenthal.
   Borrowing techniques from Chinese, Japanese and Indonesian
theater, Ms. Taymor has created a visual world that is pure
delight. The production opens with a blue figure looming
above the stage on stilts, waving ribbons that create an
ever-changing pattern of bright red circles. On one side of
the stage Russ Gold, the production's lone musician, plays
cymbals, percussion and other Asian-styled instruments. Soon
a sorcerer, Durandarte (Rodney Scott Hudson), enters looking
for his magic green parrot, which has escaped. Meanwhile,
prop men come on stage with paper birds on the end of long
fishing poles, which they move above their heads to simulate
flight. As these multicolored dragonflies and other winged
creatures swoop and soar above the stage, the scene is set
for an evening of bewitchment.
   When King Deramo and his prime minister Tartaglia enter
the forest of Miracoli, we see in the background a parade of
beguiling animal shapes projected on a screen in the manner
of Indonesian shadow plays; armadillos slither and lions and
deer prance and leap across the stage. Once in the forest the
two men encounter two life-size paper stags manipulated by
prop men. Moving in tandem, the stags become lyrical emblems
of the beauty of nature. There also is abundant humor in the
piece. Smeraldina (Lynn Chausow), flirting outrageously with
every man in sight, fancies herself an irresistible femme
fatale. Unfortunately, she is a would-be trophy wife whom no
one, including the king, sees as a prize.
   For the performers Ms. Taymor has created costumes, masks
and headpieces adapted both from commedia dell'arte and from
Asian theater. Tartaglia, for instance, has elements of a bat
and a bear, but actually is a unique creation. With a
headpiece puffed out both in cheeks and forehead, he wears a
cape that is jet black in back and vivid yellow on the
inside. The cape has struts, like those in a bat's wings, and
when he raises them he is an ominous figure encircled in
gold. The "deus ex machina" is a huge bear hovering over the
proceedings with elongated arms created by sticks inside
voluminous sleeves.
   "The King Stag" lasts an hour and a half without
intermission and in the final stages the fable itself becomes
tiresome. The world of Gozzi, however, as seen through the
eyes of Ms. Taymor, remains fresh and utterly delightful
throughout.
   The production first entered the repertory of the ART
several years ago and since then has been performed in Europe
and Tokyo. The current engagement, which runs through Sept.
30, is its longest continuous run in the U.S. The exchange of
productions such as this is a welcome development among
regional professional theaters. Rather than each theater
attempting to re-create both the visual effects and deft
playing style of the ART company, how much better to move the
entire production. After this it plays at Philadelphia's
Annenberg Center, Oct. 3-7.
