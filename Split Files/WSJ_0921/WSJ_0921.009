   NEW YORK -- Visa and MasterCard are considering
restrictions on who can issue their cards as banks cry foul
over the phenomenal success of AT&amp;T's new credit card.
   Senior executives at Visa and MasterCard, the two big
umbrella organizations for bank credit cards, say the reviews
are aimed at ensuring that membership regulations provide "a
level playing field" for all card issuers.

   Any restrictions probably would have little effect for
consumers, but could throw down new hurdles for companies
looking to get into the credit card business.
   Big banks resent the ease with which American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, with its Universal Card, is capturing market share
in one of the banking industry's most lucrative businesses.
AT&amp;T's Visa and MasterCard credit cards are issued by
Universal Bank in Atlanta, a subsidiary of Synovus Corp. The
debate over membership restrictions was reported yesterday by
American Banker, a trade publication.
   According to a spokesman at Visa, among the options under
consideration are closing membership or ensuring that
membership is restricted only to financial institutions.
Methods by which new members would compensate banks that
spent millions of dollars over the past 20 years building
their credit card businesses also are being studied, he said.
No attempt to oust AT&amp;T from the business appears to be under
consideration.
   "We need to seek a method insuring that new entrants pay
their fair and equitable share to compensate for the large
investments and risks you have taken in establishing and
building the Visa system," Charles T. Russell, president and
chief executive of Visa, told bank credit card executives
earlier this week.
   James Bailey, the group executive in charge of credit
cards at Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of cards, told
the executives that his bank "spent 20 years and billions of
dollars building {a credit card} infrastructure. I'm all for
competition, as long as everyone plays by the same rules."
Citibank is one of several credit card issuers that have
filed complaints against AT&amp;T's credit card operation with
the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Communications
Commission.
   In addition to AT&amp;T, the tremendous profits in credit card
operations have already drawn such nonbank competitors as
Prudential Insurance Co. of America and Ford Motor Co., both
of which issue cards through small banks that are part of
their financial services subsidiaries.
   "Any time you have a business as profitable as this, it's
going to attract competitors," said Alex W. Hart, chief
executive of MasterCard. Mr. Hart told bankers that it isn't
MasterCard's intention to restrict membership, but that the
organization is reviewing membership policies to ensure that
they are consistently applied, clear, fair and establish a
level playing field.
   "We want to be sure that the value our members have put
into the MasterCard system is respected, but we also
recognize that competition is a fact of life in the credit
card business," he said.
   Spencer Nilson, editor of a newsletter for the credit card
industry, said that it is unlikely that the credit card
organizations could legally prevent nonbank members from
joining or oust nonbank members already in the organization.
   "AT&amp;T has changed the face of the industry," he said. "The
big players who invested all the time and money in the system
over the years have a legitimate beef, so Visa and MasterCard
have to at least put up a front. But I don't think they can
pull it off."
   Bankers on the governing boards of both bodies said they
haven't been given any specific proposals and don't know when
they will.
   The effect for consumers would be minimal. The credit card
industry already offers a wide range of options, and AT&amp;T's
main contribution has been its marketing clout.
