   WASHINGTON -- Who dares to ask for more savings-and-loan
money?
   Everyone knows the massive S&amp;L cleanup will require at
least $120 billion in the next year, more than twice
originally forecast.

   But Congress -- with a nervous eye on the calendar, less
than a month away from its recess and a month and a half from
the election -- is waiting for the Bush administration to
formally ask for the funds. And administration officials
won't make the request. The administration says it's only
"prepared to discuss" a range of funding options.
   So far, the unpleasant topic has been relegated to the
closed-door budget summit, which is bogged down trying to
slash the federal budget deficit.
   Just this week, William Seidman, chairman of the
Resolution Trust Corp., the bailout agency, tallied up the
needs for the cleanup. The final costs are certainly going to
be at the high end of the administration's projections,
approximately $130 billion, not including hundreds of
billions more in interest, he said. By the end of the year,
the bailout operation will run out of funds.
   "I am astonished that we have not received a request for
$100 billion from the Treasury," said Sen. Timothy Wirth (D.,
Colo.) at a Senate Banking Committee hearing yesterday. "They
aren't going to waffle out of this. This enormously important
effort will be shut down because they won't have the ability
to operate."
   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the committee,
promised to write "a strong letter" to Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, urging him to make the specific funding
request. "We aren't going to sign any blank checks around
here," he said. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry
Gonzalez (D., Texas) has already dispatched a similar appeal
to the Treasury.
