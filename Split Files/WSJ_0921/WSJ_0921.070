   UNION PACIFIC Corp. (Bethlehem, Pa.) -- Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. affirmed its single-A rating on debt securities of this
railroad, transportation, hazardous waste and real estate
company. The ratings concern said the company's operating
units show "continued favorable earnings prospects" while the
proposed sale of its real estate business should help reduce
debt leverage.
