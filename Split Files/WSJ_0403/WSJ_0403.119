   Comerica Inc., Detroit, said it has entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire InBancshares, City of
Industry, Calif., for about $40 million.
   The merger will be the second in California for Comerica,
a bank holding company with $12 billion in assets.
InBancshares, a bank holding company with $242 million in
assets, has 70 employees at four office locations in City of
Industry, Encino, Santa Ana and San Francisco.

   Comerica said the $40 million purchase price represents
$20.25 a share for InBancshares common stock. That "will
represent approximately two times book value and 10 times
expected 1991 earnings," Comerica added.
   Comerica said the transaction, which requires regulatory
approval, should be completed in the first quarter of 1991.
That's the same timetable as Comerica's other California
acquisition of Plaza Commerce Bancorp, a San Jose bank
holding company with $485 million in assets. Jan. 1, 1991, is
the earliest date that a Michigan bank holding firm can
acquire a California institution, Comerica said.
   Comerica has operated commercial lending offices in
California since 1983.
