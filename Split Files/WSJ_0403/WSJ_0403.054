   A stronger dollar helped clobber Tokyo stocks which, in
turn, pulled U.S. stock prices modestly lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.76 points to close
at 2700.45 in light trading. Analysts noted that while
selling pressure wasn't intense, there was little buying.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange far outpaced
gainers, 1,122 to 434.

   The dollar forged higher in earlier overseas trading, but
lost most of those gains in New York. Bond prices eased
slightly.
   Analysts said the surging dollar played a role in
yesterday's Tokyo stock market plunge. The Nikkei Index of
225 selected issues posted its second-largest loss ever in
falling 1,978.38 to 28,002.07, its lowest level since
November 1988. Also contributing was a Japanese newspaper
report that insurance companies in Japan will sell much of
their stock portfolios.
   The sharp drop in Tokyo share prices carried over to some
extent to European trading, setting up the U.S. stock market
for a nosedive on the opening bell. The Dow Jones industrials
plummeted about 27 points in the first few minutes of
trading, then stabilized before regaining about 10 points of
the lost ground. But trading was sluggish throughout the day
and only in the final minutes did the Dow industrials regain
the 2700 mark.
   The dollar briefly rose above 160 yen in early Far Eastern
trading. Later, rumors that the Bank of Japan will raise
interest rates again prompted traders to take profits,
although skeptics said such a move is unlikely.
   Bond prices drifted in a relatively narrow range in light
trading. Despite Tokyo's problems, there was little flight to
quality in the U.S. Treasury market. A national purchasing
managers' survey on the industrial economy for March showed
that although economic activity is picking up, the economy
overall is contracting.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices slid in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 124.4 million shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for
each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue stood at
8.62%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was modestly higher. In late New York trading
the currency was quoted at 1.7009 marks and 158.95 yen,
compared to 1.6940 marks and 158.35 yen Friday.
