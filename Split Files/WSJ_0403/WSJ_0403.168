   M.A. Hanna Co., Cleveland, said it expects to establish a
reserve of as much as $11.5 million against first-quarter
earnings. The charge comes as a result of the bankruptcy-law
filing of a customer of a coal company in which Hanna owns a
50% stake.
   A spokeswoman at the natural resources and rubber products
concern said the $11.5 million reflects about half of the
amount the customer owes the coal company, Colowyo Coal Co.

   In the 1989 first quarter Hanna earned $13.8 million, or
54 cents a share, on revenue of $256.4 million.
   Hanna said the charge stems from last week's
bankruptcy-law filing by a customer of Colowyo. Colowyo
supplies coal to Colorado-Ute Electrical Association, which
owed Colowyo about $23 million for coal shipped during March,
Hanna said.
   Colorado-Ute filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Hanna said it remains confident about Colowyo's prospects.
