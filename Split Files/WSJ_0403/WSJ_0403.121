   CHICAGO -- William Farley's company that was set up for
the acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. defaulted on
$796 million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest
payments.
   Officials of the acquisition company acknowledged the
default, which had been expected. They also said the
acquisition unit was negotiating with bankers and had made an
exchange offer to subordinated bondholders as part of a
restructuring effort.

   While details of that exchange offer weren't disclosed, a
Wall Street person close to the negotiations said holders
would be offered a significant equity position in the target
company, West Point-Pepperell Inc., if they agreed to delayed
interest payments. Interest on about $705 million in
subordinated debt was to have been paid yesterday.
   In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Farley said the
defaults by West Point Acquisition Corp. won't affect West
Point-Pepperell. It said the debt is structured to prevent
cross-defaults.
   Still, some close to the transaction believe that default
could presage a change of ownership in the huge textile
maker, based in West Point, Ga., because the banks that lent
Mr. Farley money to make the acquisition last year hold most
of its stock as collateral.
