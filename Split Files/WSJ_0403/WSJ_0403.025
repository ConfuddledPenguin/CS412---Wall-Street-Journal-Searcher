   ATLANTA -- President Bush asked broadcasters to support
the U.S. government's new television broadcasts to Cuba,
despite fears Havana may respond with widespread jamming of
American domestic broadcasts.
   Cuba has been jamming signals sent to that country by the
government's new TV Marti television system since the U.S.
began the service late last month. Private broadcasters fear
that Cuba soon may expand its jamming activity to disrupt
frequencies used by private radio and television stations in
the southeast U.S.

   "I do understand the concerns some of you have about
this," Mr. Bush told the National Association of Broadcasters
convention here. "But I also understand that you represent
the very principle TV Marti exists to serve -- the free flow
of ideas."
   Mr. Bush declared that he doesn't intend to back away from
TV Marti despite Cuba's opposition. He told the convention
that "the voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as
there is an America to tell the truth." He urged the
broadcasters to "stand for TV Marti, to stand for freedom."
