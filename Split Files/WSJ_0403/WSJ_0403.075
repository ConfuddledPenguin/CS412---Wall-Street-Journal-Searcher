   WASHINGTON -- The White House is close to nominating
Erskine Henderson, a New York securities lawyer, to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, administration sources
said.
   Mr. Henderson, who would be the second black commissioner
in the SEC's history, is a special counsel at Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, a New York law firm known for its
mergers and acquisitions work. Mr. Henderson specializes in
securities and takeover litigation, and colleagues at the
firm said he has experience in accounting law although he
isn't an accountant.

   White House sources insisted that no decision has been
made, and that the background check on Mr. Henderson hasn't
been completed. One administration insider said that it could
be two months before the White House offers a nomination, but
that Mr. Henderson heads the short list of candidates. Others
mentioned include Washington lawyers Bruce Mendelsohn, Albert
Beveridge and Mahlon Frankhauser.
   If nominated, Mr. Henderson would fill the Democratic
commission slot left open by the January resignation of
Joseph Grundfest, a staunch free-marketeer who is now a
Stanford University Business School professor.
   The recent swearing-in of former Time Warner Inc. lawyer
Philip Lochner Jr. gives Chairman Richard Breeden a virtual
hammerlock on the five-member commission. It isn't clear how
the nomination of Mr. Henderson might affect agency policy.
   While Mr. Lochner hasn't yet voted at an open meeting, his
statements at his Senate confirmation hearing showed a
similar political bent to that of the chairman. Mr. Breeden
has pushed hard to expand the SEC's enforcement program and
to broaden the agency's jurisdiction over disclosure by
brokerage firms. Another commissioner, Mary Schapiro, often
sides with Mr. Breeden in commission votes.
   Edward Fleischman, who predates Mr. Breeden at the
commission by several years, has begun to emerge as the
agency's most dissident voice. He disagrees with the chairman
on the SEC's most controversial issue -- the chairman's
desire to regulate stock-index futures, which are now
overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Mr. Henderson, 40 years old, couldn't be reached for
comment. But colleagues describe him as a team player without
much ideological fervor. He has been a lawyer at Skadden Arps
for about 11 years following his graduation from Columbia
University Law School.
   He has represented a number of companies in takeover
situations, including Hammermill Paper Co. in the company's
effort to fend off a foray early in Carl Icahn's career.
