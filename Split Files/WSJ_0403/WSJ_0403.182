   DENVER -- After failing to obtain additional credit from
its lenders, Amdura Corp. filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The action caps a long line of trouble that began when the
automotive and hardware distributor and specialty
manufacturer bought CoastAmerica Corp. in 1988.

   CoastAmerica was acquired with a $260 million credit
facility from a group of 14 banks led by Chicago-based
Continental Bank. Last year, discontent over the handling of
the resulting debt led to a battle between then-incumbent
Amdura management and New York investor Frank J.A. Cilluffo,
who succeeded in ousting Amdura's chief executive officer and
board members in a consent solicitation.
   Last October, after a new management team took over, the
bank group gave Amdura a new $30 million credit line and
extended a $40 million bridge loan made in connection with
the CoastAmerica acquisition. But the new money wasn't enough
to stem Amdura's troubles.
   The company hasn't released financial results for 1989 but
last month Amdura said that a restructuring charge to be
recorded against fourth-quarter earnings would result in a
"substantial" loss for the year.
   Last month the company also said it was seeking additional
working capital from its lenders. Those negotiations failed.
   The company said that its hardware distribution
subsidiaries, including CoastAmerica and Amdura National
Distribution Co. would also file for Chapter 11 protection
but that its manufacturing subsidiaries, Crosby Group Inc.
and Harris Waste Management Group Inc. would be excluded from
the filing.
   The company has been trying to sell the Crosby and Harris
units. Neither sale has been completed, although a sale of
the Crosby unit is pending.
