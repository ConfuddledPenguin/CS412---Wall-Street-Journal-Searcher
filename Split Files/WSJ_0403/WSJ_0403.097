   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a case that may be a
vehicle for a ruling on the constitutionality of punitive
damages, agreed to review a $1.1 million verdict against
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   An Alabama jury in 1987 awarded $1,077,978 in compensatory
and punitive damages to four municipal employees of Roosevelt
City, Ala., for fraud by a Pacific Mutual agent.

   The four paid premiums to the city to provide them with
life and health insurance. Beginning in 1981, the city bought
policies from an agent who worked for Pacific Mutual, a
Newport Beach, Calif., company. The life insurance was issued
through Pacific Mutual, but the health policy was from
another, unrelated company which the Pacific Mutual agent
also represented -- Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co. of
Trevose, Pa., an AON Corp. unit.
   The agent arranged to have all correspondence with Union
Fidelity sent to his Pacific Mutual office in Birmingham,
Ala., rather than to the city. The four Roosevelt City
workers alleged in their lawsuit that the agent didn't
forward their premium payments to Union Fidelity. Union
Fidelity canceled the policy a few months after it began, but
the notices weren't sent to the city or the employees.
   Only when one of the four employees incurred $2,500 in
hospital bills in January 1982 did they discover that they
were no longer insured. They sued the agent and Pacific
Mutual, as his employer. The jury, holding the company liable
for its agent's actions, awarded a $1.1 million verdict
against Pacific Mutual. The verdict was upheld by the Alabama
Supreme Court last September.
   Appealing to the high court, the insurance company
challenged the constitutionality of punitive damage awards.
The high court ruled last year that large punitive awards
don't violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of "excessive
fines." But the justices left open the question of whether
such awards, issued with few limits on a jury, violate the
14th Amendment guarantee of "due process."
   But while the high court agreed to hear the appeal, which
raises the "due process" issue, the case appears to be a
dubious vehicle for such a ruling. In its verdict, the
Alabama jury lumped the damages together, making it unclear
how much of the award is compensatory and how much is
punitive.
   It is possible the court will address only the narrower
question of whether a company may be held liable for punitive
damages when the actions were taken by a subordinate
employee, rather than by the company itself. (Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Co. vs. Haslip)
                                                                                                       

   Airbag Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   Without comment, the justices let stand four rulings by
state and federal appeals courts that people injured in car
accidents can't sue the vehicle manufacturers for failing to
install airbags. The high court declined to hear appeals in
three lawsuits against General Motors Corp., one of which
also named Honda Motor Co.'s U.S. subsidiary, and in one
lawsuit against Nissan Motor Co.'s U.S. subsidiary.
   All of the cases involved the issue of whether the 1966
federal motor safety law or safety standards issued by the
Transportation Department were intended to bar manufacturers'
liability under state law for lawsuits alleging that vehicles
were unsafe because they lacked airbags. The latest safety
standard, issued in 1984, required manufacturers to phase in
passive restraints, either airbags or automatic seatbelts, in
new cars by the 1990-model year.
   Denial of the four appeals may not settle the issue of
whether such lawsuits under state personal injury laws are
pre-empted, however. Thus far, all appeals courts that have
addressed the issue have ruled that federal law pre-empts
state personal injury claims. If a state or federal appeals
court reaches the opposite result in the future, that will
make new high court appeals likely.
   All four cases were filed by injured people or the
families of people killed in car accidents between 1981 and
1985. (Wood vs. General Motors Corp.; Kitts vs. General
Motors Corp.; Taylor vs. General Motors Corp.; Meier vs.
Nissan Motor Corp.)
                                                                                                       

   California Death Penalty
                                                                                                       

   The high court, by a 6-3 vote, refused to clear the way
for the first execution in California in 23 years. A federal
appeals court judge in San Francisco last Friday stayed the
execution of Robert Harris, which was scheduled for today.
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp appealed to the
Supreme Court, asking that the state be allowed to send Mr.
Harris to the gas chamber. But the high court refused, over
the dissenting votes of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. Mr. Harris's
appeal now will be heard by a three-judge appeals court
panel.
