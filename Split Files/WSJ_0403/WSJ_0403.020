   WASHINGTON -- The right is rumbling over President Bush's
low-key approach to Lithuania's quest for independence -- but
it isn't prepared yet to openly challenge him.
   Conservatives complain that Mr. Bush, who has mostly urged
Lithuanian leaders and the Kremlin to negotiate a solution to
their standoff, should show more backbone in supporting
Lithuania's attempt to break away from the Soviet Union. Many
conservatives want Mr. Bush to acknowledge the republic's
independence, recognize its self-proclaimed government and
warn the Kremlin more bluntly against intervening.

   Yet so far conservatives don't seem prepared to go beyond
grumbling, and there isn't any organized drive to force a
change in administration tactics. The most prominent
conservative who has complained directly to Mr. Bush about
his approach, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
promptly backed off his criticism. "We had a very spirited
exchange, and he won," Rep. Gingrich said after a closed
White House meeting last week.
   Among conservatives generally, "right now there's concern,
but I think they're willing to give Bush time to see how he
plays it out," says Donald Devine, a conservative activist.
"It's very important to Bush to handle this right."
   Of course, Mr. Devine and others warn that conservatives'
restiveness would turn quickly into an avalanche of
criticism, if Mr. Bush's tactics backfire and the Soviets
crack down violently in Lithuania. In that event,
conservative restiveness over Lithuania could combine with
lingering unhappiness over Mr. Bush's overtures to China
after Beijing's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and
produce an outbreak of criticism the White House couldn't
ignore.
   But for now, the relatively muted conservative reaction
over Lithuania is surprising, considering that the Soviets'
1940 seizure of Lithuania and other Baltic republics has long
been a prominent emotional complaint among American
conservatives.
   A combination of factors seems to have converged to cause
conservatives to hesitate. For starters, some suspect Mr.
Bush might be correct in maintaining that a confrontation
with the Kremlin, while emotionally satisfying, could
actually hurt the Lithuanian cause by prompting a Soviet
backlash. That leaves conservatives agonizing over whether to
follow their hearts, which tell them the U.S. should
challenge the Kremlin, or their heads, which suggest that
caution may be wiser.
   "Sometimes you need to look beyond the immediate emotional
demand," says Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and
leading House conservative on foreign policy issues. "I
honestly am in a quandary. I don't know what to do."
   Beyond that, President Bush's understated approach with
the Kremlin seems to have produced results, in the form of
new non-Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe over
the last year. That means that President Bush, though no
darling of conservatives, has some credibility now on
East-West issues that leaves him less vulnerable to attack
from the right.
   "I'm convinced from my meeting with President Bush that,
even if he isn't doing exactly what I'd do, he's interested
in the same objective, so I'm not going to attack him," says
Rep. Christopher Cox (R., Calif.), a longtime champion of the
Baltic republics who last week reported to Mr. Bush on a
recent trip he made to Lithuania.
   More broadly, the Lithuanian showdown comes at a time when
conservative groups have begun shifting away from their
traditional focus on anti-Communist foreign policy and
devoting more attention to domestic issues. Conservative
activists aren't as poised to jump on a foreign-policy issue
as they were in the days before the Soviet threat began
receding.
   Of course, the White House is beginning to feel some heat
from conservatives over its Lithuanian tactics. Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.) angered White House aides by pushing the
Senate to adopt a tough resolution calling on Mr. Bush to
recognize Lithuania's self-proclaimed government and to send
an ambassador to the "Republic of Lithuania." That resolution
was defeated by the Senate, which then passed a watered-down
version calling on Mr. Bush merely to "consider the call" of
Lithuania for recognition.
   "The recognition of Lithuania is the right thing to do, no
matter what the consequences," Mr. Helms declares.
   A resolution similar to Sen. Helms's has been introduced
in the House. But there, too, a milder version calling on the
administration to consider recognizing Lithuania seems likely
to pass this week. "There is a general feeling that the
president needs to be considerably more outspoken," says Rep.
Mickey Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican who is a sponsor of
the tougher House resolution.
   Similarly, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative
Caucus, maintains that grass-roots conservative unhappiness
with the administration's low-key posture is more widespread
than it seems. He says that at a recent meeting of his
organization in New Jersey, there were 300 conservatives in
attendance and "there wasn't a person in the room who wasn't
upset that there hasn't been recognition" of Lithuania.
"There is a considerable amount of disaffection."
   Mr. Phillips argues that the disaffection hasn't been felt
more because there isn't a clear conservative leader to take
the lead -- particularly since Rep. Gingrich backed down
after his exchange with the president. The criticism
therefore "is diffused," Mr. Phillips says. "I think Bush has
been very lucky politically."
   White House aides contend that most conservatives
basically agree with Mr. Bush that America's top priority is
to ensure that Mr. Gorbachev and other Kremlin leaders
continue their overall reforms of the communist system -- and
to prevent the Kremlin from using flashpoints such as
Lithuania to halt that reform process. "George Bush is
trusted at this critical time by a lot of conservative
leaders because he's seen as having kept the main thing the
main thing: the focus on the Soviet Union," says Douglas
Wead, a presidential assistant who is a liaison to
conservative groups.
   Still, conservative activists are poised to attack if
things turn nasty in Lithuania despite Mr. Bush's pleas for
restraint. If that happens, their unhappiness over the
administration's tactics in Lithuania and China will release
"a growing sense of outrage that will have political
repercussions," says Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan
administration Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for
Security Policy.
