   Havas S.A., a French media, travel and advertising group,
said it entered into an asset swap with Bollore Technologies
S.A. of France that will make Havas Europe's leading travel
agency concern.
   The deal calls for Havas's tourism subsidiary Havas
Tourisme to acquire Bollore's SCAC Voyages unit for about 150
million francs ($26.3 million). At the same time, Havas
Tourisme will acquire a 10% shareholding in Diners Club de
France, the French arm of the U.S. credit-card concern.

   In exchange, Bollore will become a shareholder of Havas
Tourisme with a 10% stake, alongside Havas with a 65%
interest (reduced from 75%) and the Bouygues S.A.
construction group with 25%.
   Havas said the asset swap will expand the number of Havas
travel agencies throughout Europe to 500, making it the
largest network in Europe, with annual sales of more than 10
billion francs.
   Bollore said it intends to refocus its activities on its
industrial, transportation and distribution businesses.
