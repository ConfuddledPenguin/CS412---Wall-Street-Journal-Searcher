   WASHINGTON -- Three new studies financed by Kellogg Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich., found that cereal laced with the grain
psyllium reduces cholesterol. But the findings may touch off
a fresh round of health claims and counterclaims similar to
the dispute over the benefits of oat bran.
   All three of the new studies tested people with high
cholesterol levels who had already been put on
low-cholesterol diets. The addition of psyllium, which is
high in soluble fiber, further reduced cholesterol levels and
lowered cholesterol more than other fibers, including oat
bran, they found.

   As a result, the Kellogg-financed researchers said, cereal
containing psyllium can reduce the risk of heart disease by
fighting cholesterol-clogging of the arteries. Kellogg, which
orchestrated a big public-relations effort to promote the new
studies, sells Heartwise, the only cereal with psyllium sold
nationwide by a major cereal company. But psyllium isn't
without controversy. Last year, the Food and Drug
Administration looked into the safety of its use in large
quantities in cereal. In response, General Mills Inc. took a
psyllium-based cereal off the market.
   Psyllium, also known as flea wort, is grown primarily in
India. It has been used for years by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in
its laxative Metamucil. The new studies, which were released
at the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies
for Experimental Biology here, all concluded that psyllium is
safe in cereals, although some of those in the tests reported
such effects as gas, bloating and cramping -- symptoms common
to a sudden increase in fiber consumption.
   All three studies measured the impact of psyllium after
the subjects had been put on a low-fat diet and fed cereal
supplied by Kellogg. The studies were conducted at the
University of Kentucky, George Washington University, and the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.
   A Kellogg spokeswoman said, "We're encouraged by the
studies," but she wouldn't say how they might influence the
company's marketing plans for Heartwise, which isn't a big
seller, or other new cereals.
