   NEW YORK -- Horn &amp; Hardart Co. said it will sell its East
Coast restaurant holdings, which include Bojangles' Fried
Chicken &amp; Biscuits, Tony Roma's and Arby's.
   A Horn &amp; Hardart spokesman said the company has held
discussions with potential buyers of the assets. But he
declined to say how much Horn &amp; Hardart expected to net from
the chains, which should be sold by year's end. The group
includes 51 company-operated restaurants; they represented
about $95 million of Horn &amp; Hardart's 1988 revenue, which
totaled $500 million.

   When the company's East Coast holdings are sold, Horn &amp;
Hardart's remaining restaurant operations will consist of
International King's Table Inc., a West Coast-based chain of
83 restaurants that the company plans to keep.
   Horn &amp; Hardart said it is selling the restaurants to focus
on Hanover Cos., its direct marketing subsidiary, which
generated $316 million of revenue in 1988. "The opportunities
presented by the direct marketing industry make it advisable
to focus our financial and human capital in that direction,"
said Donald Schupak, Horn &amp; Hardart's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Horn &amp; Hardart agreed to sell to Burger King Corp., a unit
of Grand Metropolitan PLC, its franchise and territorial
rights to operate Burger King restaurants in the New York
area. Horn &amp; Hardart is also proceeding with a plan to sell
its New York City real-estate assets and Las Vegas casino
interest.
