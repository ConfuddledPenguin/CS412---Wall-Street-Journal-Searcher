   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it ended a previously
reported agreement to sell its industrial mineral assets to
60%-owned Avalon Corp. but continues to negotiate the sale to
Avalon of its 17% interest in Poco Petroleums Ltd.
   The Toronto-based gold-mining company said the agreement
with Avalon was ended after a minority partner in one of
Corona's mineral properties decided to oppose the sale. The
transaction had been conditional on Avalon obtaining 100%
ownership of the assets.

   A Corona spokesman said he expects the sale of the Poco
Petroleums stake to be made at "close to market value,"
giving the transaction an indicated value of about 51.6
million Canadian dollars (US$44.1 million).
   Avalon, an energy exploration and production concern based
in New York, already holds as its main asset a 32% stake in
Poco Petroleums.
   As reported, Poco Petroleums is negotiating a merger with
Voyager Energy Inc. on a share-exchange basis. Avalon said
separately that it has obtained an option to purchase about
32% of Voyager Energy's shares on a fully diluted basis from
CanCapital Corp. for about C$67 million.
   Poco and Voyager are oil and natural-gas concerns based in
Calgary, Alberta. CanCapital is an investment concern based
in Calgary. Avalon said it expects to excercise the option if
the merger between Poco and Voyager is completed. The option
expires Dec. 30.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Poco Petroleums
shares closed unchanged at C$7.375 ($6.30). Avalon closed at
$5.375, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
