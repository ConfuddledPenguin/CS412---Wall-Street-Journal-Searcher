   NEW YORK -- AT&amp;T Computer Systems unveiled several new
computer and communications products, including a powerful
entrant into the increasingly competitive market for
minicomputers handling transactions.
   The new mini, which had been expected, comes in a series
called the AT&amp;T System 7000 and is being marketed to
companies with heavy transaction processing needs such as
hotels, financial-services companies and phone companies. It
is also the product of a yearlong collaboration between the
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. unit and Pyramid
Technology Corp., Mountain View, Calif., which designed and
builds the machine.

   The 7000 is AT&amp;T's first minicomputer product employing
reduced-instruction-set-computing (RISC) architecture. RISC
designs offer faster computing since the computer needs fewer
internal instructions to perform tasks. The computer also
uses the Unix software operating system designed by AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories and is said to handle 170 transactions per
second and up to 122 million instructions per second.
   James E. Clark, AT&amp;T product management and development
vice president for minicomputers and high performance
systems, said the new line expands the performance of AT&amp;T's
products beyond its current top-of-the-line 3B minicomputers.
This, he added, should make AT&amp;T competitive with low-end
mainframe computers made by International Business Machines
Corp. and Amdahl Corp. and RISC-based systems that AT&amp;T
expects its competitors such as Digital Equipment Corp. to
bring out in 1991.
   Pricing for the new computer ranges from $88,000 for a
system, including software, that handles 128 computer users,
to $225,000 for a system tying together 1,000 users.
