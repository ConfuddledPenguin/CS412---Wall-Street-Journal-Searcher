   NEW YORK -- Federated Stores Inc. said its Federated and
Allied retailing units incurred losses totaling $45.8 million
for the four weeks ended March 3. The figure excludes the
costs of filing for Chapter 11 status.
   The Campeau Corp. unit said the performance "exceeded its
expectations" for the first complete month of operation since
filing Jan. 15 for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.

   But Federated didn't provide financial results for
February 1989, so a direct comparison couldn't be made
independently.
   Federated Stores Inc. was formerly known as Campeau
(U.S.). Late last week, Federated filed for Chapter 11
status, calling the filing a "procedural step" as part of its
reorganization plan. Federated Stores remains fully owned by
Campeau, based in Toronto.
   The Federated Department Stores Inc. division incurred
losses of $29.9 million on revenue of $277 million. Its
outlets include Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Strauss, Burdines,
Lazarus and Rich's/Goldsmith's.
   The Allied Stores Corp. division had a loss of $15.9
million on revenue of $156.7 million. Its stores include Bon
Marche, Jordan Marsh, Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh, and
Stern's.
   Although February wasn't profitable for Federated Stores,
it was a marked improvement compared with the losses incurred
for the 20 days ended Feb. 3, 1990. In that period, Federated
had a loss of $37 million on revenue of $158.6 million; the
Allied unit posted losses of $19 million on $77.3 million of
revenue.
   Altogether, the Allied and Federated units have incurred
losses of $101.8 million since filing for Chapter 11 status.
"Half of that loss is interest expense being accrued by the
companies at the same rate as was paid in the pre-petition
period," said a Federated Stores representative.
   "It's a lot of money to lose in such a short period," said
Howard Bloom, president of Chetta B. Inc., a women's apparel
maker. "We are shipping to them, however, and I would like to
continue doing business with them."
   Other manufacturers, as well as one important factoring
company, also expressed support for the Allied and Federated
units.
   "February is generally a weak retailing period," said
Frank DeRita, senior vice president, Congress Talcott Corp.,
a major factoring company. "There is a relative safety net
because they have enough cash on hand to meet trade
obligations in April and beyond. Considering the filing, and
this period in the retail cycle, this is to be expected."
Factors buy retail payables from manufacturers at a discount,
thus providing them with cash.
   "It's fairly normal to show losses like this in a
restructuring," added Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller
Ltd., a women's apparel supplier. "What we want to know is
whether the bleeding has stopped. If this performance means
they've cleaned up their inventory, that's fine. The history
of retailers coming out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
isn't great."
   Federated Stores said that it ended the February selling
period with "stocks in better shape" than anticipated.
