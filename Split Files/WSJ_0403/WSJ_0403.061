   HONG KONG -- The value of Hong Kong's total retail sales
fell 1% to 10.60 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$1.36 billion)
in January from HK$10.67 billion (US$1.37 billion) a year
earlier, the government reported.
   The decline was caused by a slowing in both local and
tourist spending, the government said.
