   INVISIBLE WORK FORCE

   Women are the world's invisible work force, the United
Nations International Labor Organization said in a report.
   Millions of working women are simply ignored in labor
statistics, giving a distorted view of reality and leading to
misguided economic policies or even the neglect of women in
development strategies, the report said. These legions of
"invisible" women can be found everywhere from Third World
agriculture to family businesses in industrial nations such
as Britain and France, it added.
   "Data specific to agricultural sectors, where women are
traditionally active, are particularly suspect and suggest
that women are simply not being counted," the report said.
   Many countries admitted they excluded women in agriculture
from their statistics. Algeria, for one, said it had excluded
1.2 million such women, probably unpaid workers on family
farms.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE ATTACKS EVANGELISM
                                                                                                       

   Singapore proposed a law to stop what it considers
aggressive evangelism. Critics say the bill, which could ban
people from preaching or editing religious publications, is
intended to silence political dissent. But the government
responded in a report, "University students have been
harassed by over-zealous Christian students." It added, "In
hospitals, some doctors and medical students have tried to
convert critically ill patients to Christianity on their
deathbeds."
                                                                                                       

   BAD NEWS FOR UNESCO
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. and Britain are expected to announce they won't
rejoin the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization because they remain unhappy about its
management. Unesco sources said the British announcement was
likely this week, possibly today, while the U.S. would reject
the agency later this month. The U.S. and Britain, which took
away some 30% of Unesco's funding when they left in 1985, are
said to believe Unesco's Spanish director-general, Federico
Mayor, has failed to correct what they say is the
organization's anti-Western bias.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN EXPORTS FEWER VCRS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's exports of videocassette recorders and
color-television sets fell in February from a year earlier,
the Electronics Industry Association of Japan reported. A
total of 1.77 million VCRs were exported in February, down
6.3% from the February 1989 figure of 1.89 million. A total
of 255,704 Japanese color TV sets were exported in February,
down 23.1% from 332,499 units last year. An association
spokesman said the continuing trend toward increased overseas
production by Japanese manufacturers was a principal reason
for the declining figures.
                                                                                                       

   SPAIN'S OLYMPIC PREPARATIONS
                                                                                                       

   Spain has created a special government commission to
oversee preparations for the Barcelona 1992 Olympics. A
spokesman for Spain's Socialist government said the
commission was designed to give maximum political backing to
the Olympics and ensure that preparations for them go
smoothly. Disagreements between local politicians over
financing and other issues have led to delays in projects
connected with the Olympics, including a new highway from
Barcelona's airport and a subway line to the Olympic stadium.
                                                                                                       

   JORDAN RECALLS OFFICIALS
                                                                                                       

   Jordan is recalling 40 non-diplomatic officials from
embassies in Western countries. Foreign Ministry
Secretary-General Mutasem Bilbeisi said the move was designed
to cut a projected budget deficit of $299.5 million this year
by $5 million. Jordan has a foreign debt of $8.30 billion.
Mr. Bilbeisi said those affected by the decision are
counselors, cultural officials and other representatives who
aren't officially part of the diplomatic corps.
                                                                                                       

   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                                                                                                       

   The European Community submitted a detailed proposal to
trade negotiators for new international rules to protect
rights to intellectual property such as patents, copyrights
and trademarks.
   The proposal, presented in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva, aims to fight increasing
counterfeiting and piracy. New accords on
intellectual-property rights and other sectors of world trade
are due to be signed by GATT's 96 members in December after
four years of negotiations.
   The EC's draft would protect patents for 20 years.
Copyrighting is protected for 25 to 50 years, and the initial
registration of a trademark would be valid for 10 years under
the proposal.
   The U.S., the EC and Japan have pressed for more stringent
intellectual-property rules. By contrast, some developing
countries led by India have argued that ready access to
information is essential to their development and shouldn't
be controlled through GATT.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   April snow fell on Jerusalem yesterday for the third time
in 120 years but quickly melted. Israeli weather officials
said previous April falls were recorded in 1870 and 1949. . .
. A survey by one of West Germany's largest coffee companies
found that 95% of West German women in the 25-to-40-year-old
age group want to wake up Sunday mornings to romantic "little
morning kisses" and some 81% liked the idea of being served
coffee and crispy rolls. But making love along with the
kisses was the choice of only 26%. The survey didn't ask
men's opinions.
