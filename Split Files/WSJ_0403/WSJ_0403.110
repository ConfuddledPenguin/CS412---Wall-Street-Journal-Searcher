   With many banks in deep trouble, why would anyone suggest
abolishing reserve requirements? Actually, there couldn't be
a better time.
   The idea that banks should put aside some money just in
case depositors start beating on their doors has a long
history. Robert Auerbach, in his textbook, "Financial Markets
and Institutions," says reserve requirements were first
imposed by the state of Virginia in 1837. In 1864 the
coverage of requirements was greatly expanded when the
National Bank Act stipulated that banks were to hold reserves
against deposit liabilities.

   Nearly everyone thought that the aim was to ensure the
safety of deposits and the soundness of the banking system.
Most people now recognize that setting requirements at the
levels that have existed is a little bit like requiring every
home owner to keep a pail of water handy for future fires. In
the real world the requirements proved to be useless against
the bank runs of the early 1930s.
   There was a way around that problem. Over the years,
Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman and some other economists have
urged 100% reserve banking. It would give the depositors much
greater safety, and also change the existing system so
drastically that the idea has never gotten anywhere. In any
case, deposit insurance now largely protects depositors,
although it hasn't been the best of news to taxpayers.
   For many years, required reserves were supposed to play a
role in monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve raised
requirements, banks would have smaller free reserves and
would be able to lend less. The money supply would grow more
slowly. Supposedly, it worked the other way, too. If the
banks had more reserves they would make more loans.
   In 1936, however, the banks had a lot of excess reserves
but weren't lending very much. So the Fed figured they didn't
need the reserves; it jacked up requirements. The banks,
frightened by the Depression, cut their loans, trying to
offset the higher requirements. So the Fed raised
requirements again, and the banks slowed their lending even
more. The result was the recession of 1937-38, an event that
soured many people on using required reserves for monetary
policy.
   For years the Fed has hardly used the requirements at all,
possibly because of this demonstration of how powerful they
are. The rules have been modified occasionally. From 1969
until the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary
Control Act of 1980, reserve requirements allowed banks to
base reserves not on current deposits but on deposits two
weeks earlier. This greatly increased the volatility of
interest rates and monetary policy.
   But the requirements persist. Why? Some people suggest
that cutting or reducing the requirements would cut revenue
of the Treasury and increase the budget deficit. The Fed buys
a lot of Treasury securities and gives a large portion of its
earnings to the Treasury. That in itself is one of the
strange aspects of Fed history; the payments to the Treasury
are supposed to be for the privilege of issuing Federal
Reserve notes.
   However, Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate
Bank of Los Angeles, remarks that the arguments that
requirements should be retained to make money for the
Treasury "should be rejected as a cynical response that
places short-term political objectives ahead of the creation
of a more sound and efficient financial sector."
   Other major countries appear to be deciding that reserve
requirements serve no useful purpose. Britain has a
requirement of only one-half of 1%, a fact that is causing
central banks elsewhere in Europe to lower their requirements
because of competitive forces associated with the monetary
unification of Europe. "In 1988," Mr. Jordan notes, "the
Swiss National Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia
eliminated reserve requirements altogether. The Bank of
Canada also is in the process of eliminating reserve
requirements because they are no longer viewed as essential
for the conduct of monetary policy."
   It would be enough of an argument against reserve
requirements to show that they are essentially useless. The
statute books are cluttered with too many rules that achieve
no worthwhile purpose. But the argument goes beyond that.
   On the one hand, government regulators are pressing
financial institutions to increase their capital. This
pressure makes sense, since many institutions have had
serious problems, at a time when they are facing an
increasing global demand for their services.
   What doesn't make sense is that at the same time the
government is imposing reserve requirements, what amount to
severe taxes on the institutions. Their reserves at the Fed
earn no interest.
   Mr. Jordan urges that the Federal Reserve announce a
program of reducing reserve requirements from the current 12%
to the statutory minimum of 8%. Then the Fed should seek new
legislation to permit reducing the requirement to zero or, at
most, to a level that doesn't exceed the minimum needed for
purposes of clearing.
   At the moment, unfortunately, the Fed appears to be moving
in the wrong direction by proposing that the existing
excessive reserve requirements be extended to foreign
deposits at U.S. bank subsidiaries and branches. "That idea,"
Mr. Jordan says, "is a nonstarter. International competitive
factors will not permit it."
   If the Fed wants to reduce the inequity between foreign
and domestic deposits, the easy way to do it is to reduce the
requirement for domestic deposits, not raise it for foreign
accounts.
   Perhaps there was a time when reserve requirements made a
certain amount of sense. If so, that time has clearly come
and gone.
