   NEW YORK -- The mortgage-backed securities market received
another jab yesterday when Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it may downgrade the credit rating on $26 billion of
securities issued by the nation's savings and loan
associations.
   Moody's said the possible action would involve the
mortgage-backed bonds and medium-term notes issued by all of
the nation's savings and loan associations -- those under
government conservatorship along with those that are
independent.

   Moody's announcement follows similar action taken late
last month by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which said it may
lower the rating on $20 billion of debt issued by S&amp;Ls.
   Meanwhile, Treasury bonds ended little changed after a day
of quiet trading.
   The reviews by the nation's two largest credit rating
agencies were prompted by recent statements by Resolution
Trust Corp., the federal agency created to manage the savings
and loan bailout.
   Last month, following the seizure of Franklin Savings &amp;
Loan, the agency said it believes that under the thrift
industry restructuring law, it has the authority to stop
paying interest on fixed-income securities that were issued
by thrifts placed under RTC conservatorship -- even when the
securities are backed by collateral.
   If RTC decides to exercise such authority, "this may be
considered a default on the interest payments," said Raymond
McDaniel, an associate director at Moody's. "It is
potentially changing the original promise that investors
believed they were getting in the securities."
   Mr. McDaniel said that in a meeting with credit rating
agencies yesterday, RTC outlined five options concerning the
resolution of the interest-payment issue. Under the RTC
option most unfavorable to investors, Mr. McDaniel said they
would at the most lose one or more interest payments but not
the principal.
   Moody's said RTC's five options concerning interest
payments on thrift bonds were: No post-receivership interest;
government rate of interest from the date of receivership
until the date of repudiation with no interest until
collateral liquidation and payment to investors; government
rate of interest from the date of receivership until
collateral liquidation and payment to investors; payment at
the security's stated rate of interest until repudiation,
with a government rate of interest until liquidation; and
payment at the security's stated rate of interest until
liquidation (the regulatory practice before the thrift
bailout law).
   Mr. McDaniel said he expects RTC to make a decision within
two weeks.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds drifted lower yesterday, along with the
U.S. dollar, after a day of dull trading activity.
   At the start of yesterday's session, dealers expected
bonds to post modest gains in a follow-through from a rally
overseas that was triggered by falling Japanese stock prices.
The Nikkei index of the Tokyo stock market fell 1978.38
points, the second largest decline since the October 1987
stock market crash.
   As the Nikkei plunged, some investors sold stocks and
bought U.S. Treasury bonds. That lifted prices of the bonds
in Tokyo. But trading in the U.S. was quiet.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 98 17/32 to
yield 8.62% compared with 98 19/32 to yield 8.62% on Friday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 99 to yield
8.63% compared with 99 1/32 to yield 8.63% on Friday.
   Short-term rates were lower when compared to last week at
the U.S. government's regular weekly auction.
   The Treasury said that the average discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.83% yesterday and that the
average discount rate on six-month bills was 7.81%. The rates
were down from last week's auction when they were 7.85% and
7.83% respectively.
   The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.72% at the auction Feb. 26. The rate on
six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.79% at
the auction on March 5.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated April 5. The 13-week bills mature
July 5, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Oct. 4, 1990.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were unchanged to up
slightly, with issues falling from highs earlier in the day
in thin trading.
   Among new issues, Citibank offered $210 million of
mortgage pass-through securities yesterday that are backed by
residential mortgage loans.
   The issue, which is expected to be rated triple-A by the
credit rating agencies, is guaranteed by Financial Security
Assurance.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Southland Corp. were little changed
despite late news that the firm posted a loss of $1.01
billion in the fourth quarter after a $947 million write-off
of good will.
   The Dallas-based convenience store operator said its most
recent internal forecasts show that it won't meet certain
financial covenants with its banks, which hold more than $1
billion of senior debt.
   The company also said it may be forced to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if it can't complete a
restructuring, which is contingent on Southland swapping
about $1.8 billion in public debt for stock and new zero
coupon bonds. So far, many bondholders have balked at terms
of the swap. Southland's 16 3/4% subordinated debentures, due
in 2002, were offered unchanged at 14 1/2. But there were no
bids for the securities. The company's 15 3/4% senior
subordinated notes, maturing in 1997, were also little
changed at 23 1/2.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Outperforming U.S. Treasury issues, municipal bonds were
flat to up 1/8 point in late dealings, with bonds showing
little price movement after gains posted earlier in the day.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
issue of 2018 was up 1/8 point at 97 3/8 to yield 7.42%,
which was 0.01 percentage point lower than that of late
Friday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market followed the yen
yesterday, opening weaker as the dollar traded as high as
160.30 yen but recovering as the yen rose.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark No. 119 4.8% bond due in 1999 was at 7.355%. The
price was up 0.04 at 85.99.
   Dealers were mixed on whether the drop in the Nikkei stock
index of the Tokyo stock market was a bullish or bearish
factor.
   "There was talk of selling stock and buying bonds," said
one dealer. Other dealers, however, believe the weakness of
the stock market is bearish for the bond market.
   In other markets:
   -- West German bonds ended about 0.10 point firmer after
an early morning rally. Bonn's 7 3/4% benchmark issue due
2000 ended at 95.95 to yield 8.36%.
   -- British government gilts ended firmer in quiet trading
after a late-day rally.
   Bonds and sterling had been lower during the morning as
overseas investors reacted bearishly to reports of a riot
over the weekend in London. Violence erupted during a
demonstration Saturday over Britain's new system of local
taxation, the so-called community charge. But reaction was
more muted among local participants. Meanwhile, sterling
advanced against the mark, which bolstered sentiment in
government bonds. Britain's 11 3/4% Treasury bond due
2003-2007 rose 6/32 to 98 15/32 to yield 11.95%.
