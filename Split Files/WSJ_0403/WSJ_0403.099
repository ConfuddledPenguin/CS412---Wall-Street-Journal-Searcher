   Bad news for Washington, if not the Republic: There's
evidence that for most American kids, Washington is history.
A report just out by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress says only about one-third of polled eighth graders
know that Congress makes the laws or could identify the
presidential veto. About half know that the U.S. is a
representative democracy or understand the separation of
powers. Still, there may be reasons for these results.
   Maybe they'd be better able to recognize their government
if someone asked them what a $500 billion omnibus
appropriation bill was. Or a continuing resolution. Most kids
in grade school probably think local judges make the nation's
laws. How is a 13-year-old supposed to know what a
presidential veto is if nobody's spotted more than one or two
since 1974? As to the U.S. being a representative democracy,
is this question related to the 99% re-election rate in the
House of Representatives? The reason some of their parents
don't vote is that increasing numbers of Members have no
opponent in the general election.

   We do wonder about one thing, though. If 33% know that
Congress makes laws, what does the other 66% think Congress
does?
