   Zurn Industries Inc. said it was awarded two contracts
totaling $66 million to design and build combined cycle
cogeneration power plants.
   The Erie, Pa., power equipment maker said one is from a
member of Sithe/Energies Group of New York to build a
56-megawatt plant in Sherill, N.Y. The plant is scheduled to
begin operations by October 1991. Electricity from the plant
is to be sold to Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. Steam from the
plant will be used by Oneida Silverware Co., Zurn said.

Power Product Co. at Fulton, N.Y. Coastal is a unit of
Coastal Corp., a Houston energy concern. The plant, which is
set to begin commercial operation in May 1991, will provide
electricity to Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. and will sell steam
to Nestle Foods Corp., Zurn said.
