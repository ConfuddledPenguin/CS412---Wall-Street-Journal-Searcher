   TOMS RIVER, N.J. -- Statewide Bancorp said Douglas E.
Johnson was named president and chief executive officer of
the parent and its largest subsidiary, First National Bank of
Toms River.
   He succeeds Richard D. Sutton, who continues as chairman.

   Separately, the board also approved a first-quarter
loan-loss provision of $13 million, partly because of loans
linked to New Jersey's weak real estate market. Statewide
expects to post a loss for the first quarter, although the
specific amount hasn't been determined, and it said it may
consider cutting or omitting its dividend.
   Company officials weren't available for comment.
   The provision brings the company's loan-loss allowance to
about $20 million, or 1.5% of net loans, up from $15 million
and 1.1% of net loans at the end of last year.
   The bank said it will effect cost controls including
reduced directors' fees, a reduced bank car fleet, and
labor-force cuts through attrition.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, the bank earned $6.3
million, or 59 cents a share.
