   NEW YORK -- Mortgage broker Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp.
formed a partnership with Daishinpan Co., in the latest
Japanese foray into the U.S. real estate market.
   Daishinpan will own less than 40% of the new firm, with
options to increase its holding to about 55%, people familiar
with the transaction said. The Japanese company also will
contribute an unspecified amount of capital to the firm.

   Real estate executives say deals such as this partnership
are a way for Japanese institutions to invest in U.S. real
estate, while escaping the limelight that attended Japanese
purchases of such properties as Rockefeller Center in
Manhattan.
   "The Rockefeller deal scared some people and made them
want to see Japanese deals done in a certain way," said Gary
Barth, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton USA, a
British-owned real estate firm.
   The Sonnenblick-Daishinpan partnership follows a pattern
set by other Japanese-U.S. ventures where the American entity
provides the expertise and the Japanese company supplies the
money and overseas distribution network.
   Daishinpan, a credit company with about $13 billion in
assets, will give Sonnenblick entry into Japan's vast
consumer market, allowing Sonnenblick to sell small chunks of
U.S. properties to individuals. More significantly,
Sonnenblick executives said, Daishinpan's capital base will
allow Sonnenblick to compete in growing Western European and
Asian markets.
   "We have never had to be a capital-rich company before,"
said Jack Shaffer, Sonnenblick managing director. "With the
changing market, we felt we had to have a capital base to do
things we couldn't do before."
   Sonnenblick Goldman is an old-line mortgage broker whose
main lines of business involve raising money for real estate
developers and acting as adviser on property sales. The
company is structured as a partnership; before the Daishinpan
transaction, it was 25%-owned by Robert M. Bass Interests and
25% by Interstate Properties Co. In the recent past,
Sonnenblick has raised money through such Japanese
institutions as Sumitomo Trust, Industrial Bank of Japan and
Kokusai Motors.
   Daishinpan is Japan's second-largest credit company. It is
controlled by a long list of Japanese institutions, including
Sanwa Bank, Daiwa Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and Nippon
Life, which own from 2% to 5% each of Daishinpan.
   Daishinpan's entry into the U.S. real estate market
mirrors other Japanese efforts to hook up with existing
companies. Early this year, Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co.
acquired a non-controlling interest in Lepercq Capital
Partners. Also, Nomura Securities owns 50% of Eastdil Realty,
and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Japan's owns 25% of
LaSalle Partners Ltd., a Chicago pension adviser.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is also negotiating an agreement with
Daiwa Securities Co. to form a joint venture that would sell
U.S. real estate securities in Japan.
