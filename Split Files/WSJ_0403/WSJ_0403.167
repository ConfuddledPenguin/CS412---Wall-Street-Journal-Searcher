   LOS ANGELES -- An Arizona investor alleged that
Rykoff-Sexton Inc. and two of its top officers issued a
series of misleading positive statements about the
food-service concern's finances.
   Investor Rodney B. Shields, in a complaint filed in U. S.
District Court here, charged that Rykoff concealed
"significant problems" it was having controlling expenses
related to its rapid growth and acquisitions during the
period March 3, 1989 to Feb. 7, 1990. The company also
allegedly faced undisclosed costs relating to a self-insured
health care program.

   On Feb. 7, Los Angeles-based Rykoff said it expected to
report fiscal third-quarter earnings that were a fraction of
analysts' expectations. Last month, the company reported net
income of $610,000, or five cents a share, representing an
87% plunge from $4.5 million, or 38 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue climbed 8.2%, to $343.4 million from $317.2
million.
   According to the complaint, the price of Rykoff shares
dropped from a high of $29 during the period of alleged
misleading statements to as low as $16.875 after Feb. 7. The
stock closed at $17.25 a share yesterday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading, off 25 cents.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages. Also named as
defendants are Rykoff's chief executive officer, Roger W.
Coleman, and Victor B. Chavez, chief financial officer.
   A company spokesman said Rykoff "believes it has
meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and will vigorously
defend" itself.
