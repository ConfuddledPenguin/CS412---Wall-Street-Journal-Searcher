   BONN -- West Germany's industrial production dropped a
seasonally adjusted 0.8% in February from January as energy
output plunged 10% because of warm winter weather, the Bonn
Economics Ministry said.
   Though the unusually mild winter depressed output in the
utility sector, the construction industry benefited and
boosted production 5% during the month. Mining output
increased 1.5%, while production in the manufacturing
industry as a whole was off 0.5%.

   January production data were revised upward slightly to
show a 2.1% month-to-month rise, up from a preliminary
increase of 1.7% recorded earlier.
   February's industrial production was 4.2% higher than a
year earlier, the ministry said.
