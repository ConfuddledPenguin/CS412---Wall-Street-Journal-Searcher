   NATIONAL CONVENIENCE STORES Inc., Houston, said it
completed an offer to swap a new issue of convertible
exchangeable preferred stock for its convertible debentures
outstanding. A total of $32 million, or 64.1%, of the 9%
convertible subordinated debentures, due Dec. 1, 2008, were
exchanged for 224,371 shares of the new $14.375 convertible
exchangeable preferred, the retailer said. The company
previously said the swap offer would allow it to reduce
long-term debt, increase stockholders' equity and increase
the company's dividend-paying ability, which has been limited
by covenants in its debt and loan agreements.
