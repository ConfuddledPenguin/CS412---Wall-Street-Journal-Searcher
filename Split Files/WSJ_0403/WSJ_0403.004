   Consumers who buy houses today are being offered a lot
more than four walls and a roof.
   Burdened by a slower market, builders and home sellers
across the country have unleashed an array of consumer lures
that are among the most extensive and costly that the housing
industry has seen in nearly a decade. Not since 1982, when
interest rates approached 20% and triggered widespread
giveaways, have buyers been courted with such a range of
freebies, some of which are more successful than others.

   Some developers are arranging for interest rates as low as
7%. Many builders will include any number of changes in the
floor plan for free. A California developer offers buyers
free washers and dryers and a chance to win a resort
vacation. An Illinois builder, Bigelow Group in Palatine,
will help first-time buyers by contributing up to $250 a
month to a special down payment fund.
   "Builders are using a variety of techniques to hold up
home sales in an environment of slack employment growth,
relatively high interest rates and buyer concerns about the
future of home prices," says David F. Seiders, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
   Sales of new houses generally have been sliding since last
summer, with the exception of a few monthly upticks, such as
in January, when new-home sales increased 3.1% from December,
to 607,000. Sales of existing houses also have declined. In
January, they fell 2.5% to 3.48 million units on an
annualized rate from 3.56 million units in December 1989.
   In response, the builders association says a full 50% of
builders recently surveyed are throwing in equipment or
details that used to be optional extras. About 35% pay all
points and 34% pay all closing costs, a package that can save
consumers anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000. Seventeen percent
maintain trade-in programs for existing homes and buy down
interest rates for a specified period of time.
   Private homeowners and relocation firms also have jumped
into the giveaways. Like developers, more homeowners are
offering to pick up financing fees such as points for buyers.
More offbeat is a man in Marin County, Calif., who tried to
lure buyers for his $510,000 house by including the choice of
his BMW or his Porsche Targa. PHH Homequity, a Wilton, Conn.,
relocation firm, has used free cars and trucks, free maid and
lawn service and expense-paid wedding receptions to whittle
down the time it takes to sell a house.
   As expensive as the marketing gimmicks have been, they
"have only been partly successful," Mr. Seiders says. The
biggest drag on sales has been a shrinking pool of buyers,
interest rate volatility and affordability problems.
Marketing gimmickry does little to overcome those
hard-to-cure ills, most economists say. "I don't think
{consumers} would buy just because a builder throws in a
Jacuzzi," says Brian Bragg, editor of U.S. Housing Markets, a
publication in Detroit.
   Despite PHH's efforts, for instance, it still takes an
average 151 days to sell a house, just a 10-day improvement
from the 161 days it took at year end 1987. And even with the
free car the Marin County homeowner had no luck selling. Last
week, he reduced his house to $499,000 and pulled the car
offer, according to the broker representing him.
   Others say every little bit helps. Sales would have shown
steeper declines if it weren't for the come-ons, some
analysts contend. Builders add that any sale -- even with
concessions -- is better than paying hefty carrying costs on
unsold houses. They also say they would rather offer
concessions than cut prices because financing for future
developments is based in part on prices they received for
previous sales.
   That's the attitude of W. Art Wells, a Montclair, N.J.,
builder who has pulled out the stops to sell houses in the
slow-moving New Jersey market. In past months, he has offered
a dizzying range of concessions and even bought the house of
a seller who wanted to buy one of his homes. He says he
figured it would be easier to sell the cheaper house than to
sell his more expensive brand new house.
   The lures were so sweet that Andrew and Robin De Vito
bought one of Mr. Wells's homes -- and they weren't really
looking to buy. Mr. Wells pieced together various features
from three different floor plans, incorporating chimney,
French doors and winding stairways that Mrs. De Vito liked.
He also arranged a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7% with no
points for the five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath house, for
which the De Vitos are paying between $500,000 and $600,000.
What's more, he arranged for the buyer of the De Vito's
house, which wasn't selling despite repeated price
reductions, to also receive a 7% mortgage rate.
   "When someone is giving something away free, I ask,
`where's the hook?'" Mr. De Vito says. "There ain't no hook.
He just needs to keep going."
   "We're trying our absolute hardest to market our property
as well as we can," said Mr. Wells, who says he still ekes
out a profit despite the concessions.
   Even in the once-torrid California market, concessions
have surfaced. In Colton, Calif., John C. Heers Inc. has
offered free washers and dryers for about a month. The bonus
appliances, as well as drawings to win expense-paid weekend
trips to Palm Springs, have helped boost consumer traffic
through the Southern California development to about 100
people a week, up from seven people before the promotions,
the company says. Sales, meanwhile, have increased to an
average five sales a month, up from two sales a month.
   "For the past three to four years, we haven't had to do
anything," says Deborah Millhouse, a sales marketing
assistant. But because the California market has slowed, "you
have to be a little more creative."
   Even so, it wasn't the extras that sold Creighten and
Agnes Willcutt, retirees who recently bought a $109,000,
two-bedroom, two-bath home in one of the company's seniors
developments. They simply liked the floor plan.
