   Miami financier Victor Posner said he holds a 5% stake in

Exchange Commission that he holds 674,735 Smith common
shares, for which he paid $1,545,291. On March 21, Mr. Posner
bought 66,000 Smith shares in the open market for $3.125

   Mr. Posner said he acquired his Smith stock for investment
purposes. He will review periodically his investment in the
company and may at any time decide to increase or decrease
it, he said, depending on market conditions and other
factors. He said he does not have any present plans or
proposals with respect to the company.
   Last December, Smith entered into a merger agreement with
Columbia Hospital Corp., a closely held hospital concern
controlled by former Bass family financial adviser Richard
Rainwater and Richard Scott of Fort Worth, Texas.
   Timothy Wollaeger, president and chief executive officer
of Smith, a maker of medical equipment, said he believed Mr.
Posner had boosted his stake in the company for investment
purposes only. "I view it neither favorably nor unfavorably,"
Mr. Wollaeger said.
