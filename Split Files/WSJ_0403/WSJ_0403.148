   Rumors of a broken engagement have been circulating for
months, but now it's official: Pearson PLC of Britain and
Elsevier N.V. of the Netherlands say they are no longer
discussing a merger.
   In September 1988, the two publishing companies announced
plans for cooperation and cross-shareholdings, saying they
might eventually merge. Pearson acquired 22% of Elsevier,
which in turn has a 9.4% stake in the British company.

   Since then, the fall of the pound and a surge in
Elsevier's share price has made the Dutch company too
expensive for Pearson to contemplate, officials of the two
companies say. The option of merging the companies into a
50-50 joint venture would have been unacceptable to British
investors, an Elsevier spokesman said. Meanwhile, the
takeover threats that appeared to be a major reason for the
alliance have receded.
   The two sides haven't managed to find much scope for
cooperation. So far, the only project involves the use of
Pearson expertise for a small Elsevier unit offering Dutch
financial data via telephone lines.
   But the two companies remain friendly, a Pearson official
said. "We still regard Elsevier as our long-term European
partner," he said, adding that the two are talking about
combining certain ventures in medical publishing and may
collaborate on a new financial weekly that would be
distributed for free on the Continent.
