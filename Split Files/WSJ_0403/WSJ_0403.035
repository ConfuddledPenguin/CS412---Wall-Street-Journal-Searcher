   WASHINGTON -- If the U.S. has its way in the latest round
of its trade talks with Japan, the likely loser will be the
U.S. consumer.
   If the U.S. succeeds, there will be winners on both sides
of the Pacific. Japanese consumers and U.S. producers both
would benefit from a more open and competitive Japanese
market. But the U.S. consumer would be stuck with some of the
bill for opening the Japanese market.

   The trade imbalance between the U.S. and Japan -- the
world's two largest economies -- is so intractable that each
now is reaching into the internal affairs of the other. The
aim is to address the root causes of the $50 billion annual
trade imbalance between the two nations. The U.S. believes
one major way of correcting its trade deficit is to strike an
alliance with the long-neglected Japanese consumer. Let the
Japanese buy what they want at fair prices, the argument
goes, and the deficit will begin to shrink.
   But the flip side of that argument may not play so well at
home. It is, essentially, to agree that the U.S. consumer has
had it too easy, and implement a variety of belt-tightening
measures. "I think we'd concede that we in the U.S. have
tilted too much to consumer end, but they've tilted too much
to producer end," says S. Linn Williams, deputy White House
trade representative and one of the three lead U.S.
negotiators in the talks.
   The U.S. strategy is being tested here this week during
the Structural Impediment Initiative talks. The current round
in the nine-month-old series of talks is crucial because it's
scheduled to produce an interim report this month on how each
country will address the underlying causes of the stubborn
trade imbalance between them.
   The stakes in these talks are huge, U.S. negotiators say.
"If the global trading system is to be preserved and expanded
as it has to be, it has to be clear that the same rules and
opportunities apply to everybody," says the State
Department's Richard McCormack. He, Mr. Williams and the
Treasury's Charles Dallara head the U.S. delegation. The
price of failure, the U.S. side contends, would be a
destructive spiral of protectionist trade restrictions.
   Watching the SII talks, and growing uneasy, are U.S.
politicians. Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) last week introduced
legislation mandating that if the talks fail to yield
results, trade-related issues would be pursued through
investigations under Section 301 of the 1988 trade act. Such
investigations carry the threat of future trade retaliation.
   The Japanese are increasingly fearful of U.S. trade
retaliation. To ensure that current bilateral trade talks are
on track, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu called
President Bush yesterday morning to say he had dispatched two
special emissaries to Washington. The emissaries, former
Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Noburo Matsunaga and Deputy
Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada, met yesterday with National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James
Baker. They are to see Mr. Bush tomorrow when he returns from
a speaking trip in the Midwest.
   The increasingly consumer-oriented approach -- up with the
Japanese version, and down with the American -- may yet save
the day. Recent polls show that many Japanese agree with the
kinds of market-opening reforms the U.S. is urging on Japan,
and disagree with their government's contention that the
problem lies simply in Americans saving too little and
consuming too much.
   The more-open Japanese markets that the U.S. is seeking
probably will lead to lower prices, greater competition and a
rise in Japan's standard of living. A recent survey showed
that many foreign goods were on average 70% more expensive in
Japan than in the U.S.
   The Japanese have now developed proposals that go some way
toward meeting U.S. demands. Japan is prepared to alter a law
that effectively forces outsiders to wait 10 years to get
into the large retail-store market. Another proposal would
boost Japanese spending on roads, bridges and other
infrastructure. In recent separate trade talks on
supercomputers and sophisticated telecommunications
equipment, the Japanese have shown a greater willingness to
make market-opening moves.
   The SII talks, of course, aren't dealing only with
Japanese impediments. "It's a two-way street," says
Treasury's Mr. Dallara. Japanese negotiators have come up
with a list of 80 points they think could help the U.S. cut
its budget deficit, improve its savings rate, promote
exports, improve educational standards and make industry
think longer-term. The Japanese suggested, among other
things, that the Bush administration seek to limit the number
of credit cards individual citizens can hold.
