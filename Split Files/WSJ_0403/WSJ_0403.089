   Wine importers are nervously awaiting the outcome of an
unusual flap over a fungicide that is widely used on grapes
in Europe but illegal in the U.S.
   The problem surfaced early last month when the Food and
Drug Administration detected residues of the fungicide
procymidone in two samples of Asti Spumante during a routine
check. Since then, the agency has found traces of the
fungicide in 11 of 116 Italian and French shipments,
including Beaujolais wines and more Asti Spumante, as part of
its continuing investigation. Sunday, the FDA announced it
would require some Italian and French vintners to certify
that their wines were free of the procymidone.

   The FDA doesn't believe the fungicide is a health threat
at the levels it has detected. But with consumers
increasingly skittish about pesticides and wine consumption
dropping 2% a year, the industry is worried about public
perception.
   "People in the importing business look at this and say it
has the potential to get blown out of proportion," says an
executive at a major U.S. vintner. Although the fungicide
isn't used by domestic vintners, he says all wine makers have
reason to be concerned because the image of wine in general
could be hurt. "This isn't an imports vs. California wines
issue. Something like procymidone affects all wines."
   The procymidone discovery spotlights the problem of
conflicting regulatory standards in different countries for
food additives and pesticides. Some experts question whether
U.S. regulators and marketers are prepared to deal with the
issue of imported food that meets standards in its own
country but that may not meet U.S. regulations.
   "We are going see to more of this -- pesticides that are
violative but not really a health hazard," says Richard
Jackson, who heads up the risk assessment branch of
California's department of health services. "This is a
classic example of the world getting smaller at the same time
our labs are getting better." He adds: "We are going to have
to grapple with the legal issues. Do you condemn a large
amount of food that really presents no health effect?"
   In an era when food imports are soaring, the dispute also
focuses new attention on what critics call the so-called
"circle of poison," pesticides that are banned or
unregistered in the U.S. but not overseas and thus wind up on
America's dinner table. A pending bill sponsored by Sen.
Patrick Leahy would stringently regulate food imports sprayed
with pesticides that are prohibited in the U.S.
   When it comes to wines, the problem isn't limited to
foreign-made pesticides alone. According to a staffer in Sen.
Leahy's office, U.S. chemical companies make some pesticides
for grapes that aren't registered for use here and that are
only exported. These include Dow Chemical Co.'s Gallant,
which is used in France; Dow's Gauntlet, used in Italy, Spain
and France; and Tokuthion, a pesticide used in Australia that
is manufactured in the U.S. by Mobay Chemical, a U.S. unit of
Bayer AG.
   Procymidone is approved for use in most wine-producing
nations of the world and the levels detected by the Food and
Drug Administration fall well within the tolerances of those
countries. But the Environmental Protection Agency has never
determined if the fungicide poses a health hazard. In a
somewhat curious move, procymidone's manufacturer, Sumitomo
Chemical Co. of Japan, didn't bother to petition the EPA to
set acceptable levels for the fungicide on imports.
   "There have never been any residues in wines that reached
the U.S., and it wasn't anticipated that there would be a
problem," a Sumitomo spokesman explains.
   Although Sumitomo still hasn't formally made its petition
to the EPA, the agency has begun its own toxicological
investigation into the fungicide, which causes tumors in
laboratory animals in high doses. But officials believe the
tiny amounts of procymidone found in wine shipments to date,
mostly 0.03 to 0.04 parts per million, won't pose a health
risk.
   However minimal the hazards to consumers, the potential
trade ramifications are huge. Americans buy more than $2
billion of imported wine each year, mostly from Europe. And
unless a political compromise is reached, the threat of
disrupted shipments threatens to go on for about two years,
the time it typically takes the EPA to set residue levels for
pesticides.
   EPA officials are torn between protecting the free flow of
trade, in this case wine, and the public's health. "The Food
and Drug Administration is obviously out there running their
enforcement program and that has potentially large
ramifications for international trade," says Anne Lindsey,
director of the EPA's registration division. "On the other
hand, we can only establish a tolerance {residue level} if we
can reach the conclusion that it will protect the public
health, and that process takes time."
   Although procymidone is approved by the World Health
Organization, some EPA officials privately complain its data
on the fungicide is flawed and inconsistent.
   European Economic Community officials are scrambling
behind the scenes to come up with a political solution. Since
the problem first surfaced, EC representatives have been
shuttling between Brussels and Washington in the hopes of
persuading U.S. government officials to spare procymidone
from a regulatory quagmire. "The EC is seeking some interim
relief pending what they believe will be ultimate approval of
the fungicide," says Robert Maxwell, president of the
National Association of Beverage Importers.
   In the meantime, most wine importers are keeping mum about
the situation in an apparent attempt to distance their own
brands as much as possible from the problem. But some, such
as Seagram Co. have quietly begun doing their own testing for
procymidone and they express anger at Sumitomo's negligence
in not seeking U.S. clearance.
   "The issue is how could a responsible chemical
manufacturer not have taken some action?" fumes a Seagram
spokesman. "That's what's harmful and damaging."
   Michael Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann, an upscale
wine shop in Manhattan, puts it this way: "Sumitomo's failure
to register their product with the EPA is the equivalent of a
vineyard owner bottling his wine and forgetting to put in the
cork."
