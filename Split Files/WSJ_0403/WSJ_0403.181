   A group of United Airlines unions appeared to be moving
toward a possible agreement with UAL Corp. on terms of an
employee buy-out of the nation's second-largest airline.
   Some people close to the situation said there was an even
chance of an agreement in the next few days. It appeared that
both the unions and the UAL board had a general understanding
of how an accord could be structured.

   But the same people cautioned that any number of
unresolved issues could slow the progress. In that case, both
sides were prepared to begin the hostilities of a pending
proxy fight by Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder,
which is backing the union buy-out effort.
   The group of United pilots, mechanics, and flight
attendants two weeks ago offered a package of cash, debt and
stock valued at roughly $4 billion, or $185 a share, for a
75% stake in the airline. Current UAL shareholders would keep
25% of the company.
   The unions were said to be unwilling to sweeten that
offer, even informally, without advance assurance that a new,
higher bid would be accepted. The board has been asking $220
a share, but had given some indication it might accept as
little as $200.
   UAL directors conferred by phone yesterday in a meeting
that began around 4:30 p.m. EDT. Some people said they might
reconvene in person within the next few days if they were
ready to approve the union offer.
   The maneuvering between the unions and the board, which
took place largely through phone contacts among their
advisers, was enlivened by reports of a new proposal from
Marvin Davis. The Los Angeles investor in August made a $5.4
billion bid for UAL, which set the stage for a $6.79 billion
labor-management buy-out effort that collapsed in October.
   Crain's Chicago Business reported that Mr. Davis, who last
month was released from an earlier promise not to buy UAL
stock, had submitted a "concept" for a bid higher than $220 a
share. If Mr. Davis failed to obtain financing, the Crain's
report said, UAL could sell assets and deliver the proceeds
to shareholders.
   One source confirmed that UAL has received such a
proposal. But another noted the idea isn't in writing, and
isn't being actively pursued. Aides to Mr. Davis wouldn't
comment.
   However, some takeover stock traders were skeptical,
noting the Davis proposal's similarity to the board's own
position that it might be able to deliver greater value than
the union proposal by selling assets. They speculated that
the board might be trying to use the Davis idea as a threat
to get the unions to sweeten their bid.
   UAL shares traded in a narrow range most of the day,
finishing down 87.5 cents to $161.125 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Communications between the unions and the board were
complicated by the threat that, if they couldn't agree, they
would soon be exchanging fusillades in a proxy contest. The
unions couldn't raise their bid informally, if they were then
to turn around and campaign for shareholder votes for a bid
of about $185 a share.
   Financing remained another major uncertainty. Although the
proposed price is much lower than the $300-a-share buy-out
that collapsed last fall, some bankers may be leery of
lending to an unwieldy union troika that so far lacks the
backing of an equity investor.
   Some traders believe the board may accept the union
proposal, subject to the group obtaining financing, as a way
of surviving the proxy challenge by Coniston. If the union
can't obtain financing, such a scenario could leave incumbent
UAL directors in office, leaving uncertain the fate of UAL
Chairman Stephen Wolf, whom the union group has vowed to
replace.
