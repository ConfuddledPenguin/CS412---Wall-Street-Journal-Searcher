   MOSCOW -- As the Soviet Union prepares for a new round of
economic reforms, policy makers are split over what measures
should be taken to halt the economy's worrying slide.
   The disagreements pit economists who favor rapid and
radical moves toward a market economy against government
officials who fear this would create unacceptable domestic
upheaval. The outcome could determine the fate of Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who risks losing control of
economic policy to an increasingly impatient President
Mikhail Gorbachev.

   The battle is being waged largely behind the scenes. But
in the past few days, the disputes have surfaced in Soviet
newspaper interviews. Most now agree that Mr. Ryzhkov's plans
for gradual transition to a more market-oriented economy,
unveiled in parliament in December, don't go far enough. But
there the consensus ends. Following an unpublished government
decision last month, preparatory work has been speeded up on
about 20 bills and resolutions to be presented to the Soviet
Parliament next month. They include legislation on such key
issues as reforming prices, creating a new banking system and
setting up a securities market.
   But Mr. Gorbachev seems concerned that these measures
won't be decisive enough. Meeting with his new presidential
council of advisers last week, he talked about "radicalizing"
economic reform and said that later this month the council
would discuss a new economic package, an apparent alternative
to the government's.
   In a striking change, Mr. Gorbachev described his goal as
being "a controlled transfer to market relations," dropping
his earlier hedged calls for a "planned-market economy" or a
"socialist market."
   Soviet officials say Mr. Gorbachev's remarks bore the
imprint of two radical economists who have become his
personal advisers: presidential council member Stanislav
Shatalin and outspoken academic Nikolai Petrakov. In an
interview Sunday in the newspaper Trud, Mr. Petrakov called
for creation of "a contemporary, full-blooded market," and
said the present system of economic management was bankrupt.
He didn't mention the prime minister by name, but criticized
Mr. Ryzhkov's earlier plans to stabilize the economy as being
"very indecisive."
   Mr. Petrakov advocates "painful and unpopular measures" to
turn around the economy, including an attack on rising
inflation and the closing of unprofitable enterprises. He
would cushion the blow by borrowing huge sums in the West and
using the money to fill Soviet stores with imported consumer
goods.
   Such a move is vigorously resisted by Mr. Ryzhkov, who
says the Soviet Union has already borrowed enough abroad.
Some of Mr. Petrakov's other suggestions also jar with the
more cautious approach of Mr. Ryzhkov and his advisers. In
the same issue as Mr. Petrakov's comments, Trud printed a
reply by Andrei Orlov, deputy head of the government's
economic reform committee. He warned that hasty moves toward
a market economy could exacerbate social tensions and spark
"an even more serious economic crisis."
   Western diplomats in Moscow believe Mr. Gorbachev's
election as president gives the dispute strong political
overtones. As he struggles to impose his authority, he is
seeking to wrest control of key policy issues from the
Communist Party and the government apparatus. Thus, a
high-level French government delegation visiting Moscow last
week found "everyone is working on their own economic
reforms," says a French diplomat.
   Mr. Gorbachev has already demonstrated his new economic
clout by unexpectedly firing the ministers of health and
civil aviation Friday. Both ministers were appointed by the
Parliament last summer on Mr. Ryzhkov's recommendation.
   One of the clearest areas of disagreement among policy
makers is over the crucial issue of reforming the Soviet
Union's topsy-turvy pricing system. Prices are currently
fixed by government authorities and some haven't changed for
decades. The result is that the government is forced to spend
about $160 billion in subsidies on food and some consumer
goods annually, while the cost of many industrial goods is
far higher than in the West.
   Breaking the structure and allowing prices to reflect
supply and demand has been the government's aim since Mr.
Gorbachev unveiled his initial economic reform program in
1987. But so far, the Kremlin has lacked the courage to go
ahead with the change, fearing price rises could exacerbate
growing social tension.
   The issue is now apparently back on the agenda, but there
is disagreement over how the reform should be handled, and
how quickly. Vyacheslav Senchagov, head of the State
Committee on Prices, said last week that three options are
now being considered. The first would involve an average
20%-30% increase in wholesale and retail prices, ending
subsidies and devaluing the ruble by about 50% against
Western currencies. The second option would involve copying
Poland's "shock therapy," tripling oil and coal prices to
bring them to world market levels and moving rapidly toward a
convertible ruble. This would risk an initial big surge in
inflation and high unemployment in the hope of forcing market
mechanisms to start working. The third version would be a
more timid interim move, allowing some prices to float, but
continuing to fix many others.
   The third version seems to have government support,
although it is uncertain how effective it would be. Mr. Orlov
indicated to Trud that he clearly favored this variant, and
insisted that price reform won't take place before 1991.
   But some radicals can't wait that long, and the latest
economic news has strengthened their calls for measures more
akin to Poland's. According to preliminary figures, the
Soviet Union is in a deep recession. Production dropped by
about 1% in the first two months of 1990 before adjustment
for inflation, which is estimated at between 7% and 17%. The
only part of the economy to show a substantial increase was
alcohol production, which jumped almost 12% after the
government relaxed its anti-vodka campaign.
